CALIFORNIA;
Gov. Wilson's Comeback Ends in Re-election Victory

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Pete Wilson was elected to a second term as California's governor tonight by a commanding margin over his challenger, Kathleen Brown, the State Treasurer.
But it remained unclear whether the powerful tide of support for Mr. Wilson ran deep enough to also spell victory for Proposition 187, the highly divisive voter initiative that would deny to undocumented immigrants most government services, including schooling and nonemergency health care. 
 Governor Wilson has made immigration control a central theme in his re-election battle with Ms. Brown.
Shortly after 11 P.M. Pacific time, The Associated Press said that based on early returns, it appeared that the measure would pass. The news service also reported that three-fourths of Californians who voted for Proposition 187 also voted for Governor Wilson.
Ms. Brown, in a mood of somber but good-humored realism, conceded defeat shortly after 10:15 P.M. Pacific time. After complimenting the Governor on his victory, Ms. Brown affirmed her commitment to the principles she had championed in a long, grinding campaign.
"Twenty-eight years ago tonight," Ms. Brown said, "My father told a group of supporters who were similarly gathered, he said we have to keep going. Our principles are right.
"We lost the battle," she concluded, "But we will win the war."
Minutes later, Mr. Wilson told a crowd of cheering supporters, "I must say it wasn't too long ago, the smart money pundits were not only writing me off, they were writing off California."
"About a year ago, I faced longer odds than George Foreman," he said, alluding to the boxer who on Saturday night became the oldest man ever to win the world heavyweight title.
"And to quote one of my favorite authors," he added, "as I said after the Northridge quake, they can shake us up, but they can't break us. All Californians have been fighting like a junk yard dog to turn this state around, and you are succeeding."
Mr. Wilson's triumph marked an extraordinary comeback for a politician all but repudiated by Californians less than a year ago when Ms. Brown, a 47-year-old moderate liberal, seemed to have the race sewn up. At that time some independent polls gave her a commanding 20-point lead over the incumbent.
But Ms. Brown's campaign began to falter, plagued in part by organizational disarray, but perhaps more importantly, by what analysts said was a deep current of discontent with politicians, particularly those espousing a liberal platform, coursing through the California electorate.
Political analysts also attributed Ms. Brown's slippage and eventual defeat to her ineffectiveness in finding a message to compete with Mr. Wilson's ability to define and exploit this year's most potent issues -- crime and immigration.
Moreover, Mr. Wilson was helped mightily by what many voters viewed as his decisive handling of California's recent traumas, not only natural disasters like drought, floods, fires and earthquakes, but also an economy that is beginning to show signs of reviving from the worst recession since the 1930's.
Since surveys of voters leaving polling places detected the Wilson victory long before the voting was over, Proposition 187 provided most of the suspense tonight.
Proposition 187, named "Save Our State" by its proponents, is based on the premise that California's social services are the main magnet drawing illegal immigrants across the border. Turning off that magnet, they argue, will deter new arrivals.
The measure would not only deny undocumented aliens schooling and nonemergency medical care, but would require teachers and doctors to give immigration authorities the names of all people they know or suspect to be in the nation illegally.
But no matter how Draconian benefit polices become, most analysts say the lure of California's jobs and comparatively high wages are likely to keep attracting Mexicans, Central Americans and others over the border and to keep most of the 1.5 million illegal immigrants now estimated to be in the state from voluntarily returning home.
Still, until last month, independent surveys consistently put the pro-187 forces far ahead, some by more than 25 points. Since then, there has been a drastic fallout in support for the proposition, particularly since it was criticized by national political figures who share little ideological common ground.
The Associated Press reported that about 500 people shouting "racism! racism!" rallied near the United States Embassy in Mexico City today in the latest of a series of boisterous protests against Proposition 187. At least 100 riot police with metal shields and clubs guarded the American compound.
Here In Los Angeles, several law enforcement agencies ordered extra patrols at polling places and schools after outbreaks of violence during the campaign, and some civic leaders here fear their could be an eruption of lawlessness if the measure should win.
There were also scattered student protests -- mostly by Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans and African-Americans -- against Proposition 187, but the demonstrators made up only a fraction of the enrollments of the local school districts.
Late tonight the Los Angeles Unified School District's Board of Education announced it will go to court on Wednesday if Proposition 187 won.
"We stand firmly with all of our students and their parents in opposition to this disruptive and divisive proposals," said Mark Slavkin, the school board president.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: THE SENATE
VIRGINIA;
After a Bitter Campaign, Voters Stick With Robb

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Wednesday, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Senator Charles S. Robb beat back a ferocious challenge yesterday by his Republican opponent, Oliver L. North, after one of the bloodiest and most closely watched campaigns in the country.
With Republicans winning elsewhere, analysts here were surprised by how quickly Mr. Robb's victory became evident tonight. Virginia is a conservative state, and Mr. Robb, a Democrat, was thought to be hobbled not only by reports about his personal life but also by his association with President Clinton, whose standing here is relatively low. 
 But Virginians apparently cared less for Mr. North than they did for Mr. Clinton, whom Mr. North attacked at every turn. Robert D. Holsworth, a political analyst at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, said Mr. North probably erred in concentrating more on anti-Clinton sentiment than he did on Mr. Robb's personal problems.
At 1:50 A.M. today, with 99 percent of the precincts reporting, the vote was:
Robb . . . 46%
North . . . 43%
An independent, had Marshall Coleman, had 11 percent.
"How sweet it is!" Mr. Robb yelled into a microphone at his headquarters in Tysons Corner.
He attributed the win to his wife, Lynda, saying she had worked harder to secure it than he had. Perhaps her most significant role was in standing by her husband despite accusations about his personal life, including those by Republican saying he had attended parties with drug users and had an extramarital dalliance with a former beauty queen.
Mr. North made his concession speech from the Richmond Center. In a conciliatory tone, he told his somber supporters that they had "redefined the political debate" in the country.
Larry Sabato, a political analyst at the University of Virginia, said it was "just incredible" that a "damaged, liberal Democrat, beholden to President Clinton" could win in a Republican year. He attributed this phenomenon solely to Mr. North's weakness.
Mr. North spent $18 million on the race; Mr. Robb spent $5 million.
Mr. Robb benefited by a strong turnout in the Washington suburbs, where his support for abortion rights, the crime bill and President Clinton's economic program were appreciated and where disapproval of Mr. North's ties to the Christian Coalition and right-wing conservatism ran deep.
Mr. North's supporters attributed his loss to dissension within the Republican ranks. Mr. North, a former Marine lieutenant colonel, was repudiated by several leading Republicans, including former President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, and leading military officers. Mr. North was convicted of felony charges for his role in the Iran-contra affair. The conviction was later overturned.
But the North camp put the heaviest blame on Senator John W. Warner, the state's senior Republican, who denounced Mr. North as unfit to serve in the Senate and who stuck strongly through Election Day to the independent candidacy of Mr. Coleman.
Senator Warner sloughed off accusations last night that by supporting Mr. Coleman he had split the Republican vote and lost the seat for the party against one of the most vulnerable Democrats in Virginia history.
Some analysts said last night that Republicans had made a grave mistake in nominating a candidate as divisive and polarizing as Mr. North.
Exit polls from the television networks showed that 42 percent of the voters thought neither candidate had the honesty and integrity to serve in the Senate.
Both candidates ran television commercials in the last few days in which they admitted that they were not perfect and that they had made mistakes.
Several analysts said last night that the campaign turned against Mr. North three weeks ago. His campaign aides, perhaps overconfident at that point, apparently believed that they were far enough ahead to stop attacking Mr. Robb and to turn instead to presenting a more positive image of Mr. North.
"We thought it was going to be 'the liar versus the pervert,' but it came down to 'Clinton versus character,' " said Mr. Holsworth, the analyst. "North didn't hit him on what many people thought was Robb's major vulnerability."
That is, while Mr. North started attacking Mr. Clinton, Mr. Robb kept pounding Mr. North on character.
That onslaught reached its climax on Monday, when Mr. Robb called Mr. North "a document-shredding, Constitution-trashing, Commander in Chief-bashing, Congress-thrashing, uniform-shaming, Ayatollah-loving, arms-dealing, criminal-protecting, resume-enhancing, Noriega-coddling, Society Security-threatening, public school-denigrating, Swiss-banking-law-breaking, letter-faking, self-serving, election-losing, snake-oil salesman who can't tell the difference between the truth and a lie."
Mr. North, by contrast, took to wearing a blue flannel shirt and khakis and projecting the image of a family man in commercials with one of his daughters. He ran one advertisement against Mr. Robb that focused on the Senator's extramarital liaisons, but quickly pulled it, saying his mother did not like it.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: NEW YORK GOVERNOR
MAN IN THE NEWS: George Elmer Pataki;
Soft but Forceful Steps Lead to Paradoxical Victory in the Governor's Race

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
State Senator George E. Pataki, who was elected New York's 55th Governor last night, is almost a millionaire, yet he comes off as homespun and unpretentious: He says "gosh" a lot and is so forgetful of his appearance that on a recent campaign trip he mismatched one suit's blue jacket with another's gray trousers, and then had to change pants in a hotel alcove.
He is a graduate of Yale College and Columbia Law School and can argue points like a Wall Street litigator, yet he cries at one of his favorite films, "Old Yeller," and carries a dollar signed for good luck by the late Lubavitcher Grand Rabbi, Menachem M. Schneerson. 
 In such ways, Mr. Pataki, 49, has distinguished himself as an unpredictable and often independent personality. And to his friends and supporters, he possesses a Zen-like balance, a willingness to listen and an ability to negotiate compromises.
For those reasons, his supporters say, Mr. Pataki can be expected to govern the state much as he served in the Legislature, moving with soft but forceful steps to win the things he wants.
"You'll see in January," said his friend, legislative counsel and campaign chairman, Michael Finnegan. "George isn't the type that needed to have his name on every bill he worked on. He wins things with quiet consensus."
A onetime Mayor of Peekskill and five-term state legislator, Mr. Pataki also stands out in sharp relief to the man he has unseated, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. Where Mr. Cuomo offers baroque explanations for the state's daunting problems and how to deal with them, Mr. Pataki has been a study in simplicity: cut taxes, cut spending, get tough on crime. Where Mr. Cuomo can eviscerate with his street-smart wit, Mr. Pataki is unflappably affable. Where Mr. Cuomo's oratory takes wing, Mr. Pataki speaks in the tripping cadences of the regular guy.
What is perhaps most paradoxical is that 13 months ago, those very characteristics seemed to conspire against Mr. Pataki's becoming the Republican nominee. He was too bland, they said. He couldn't raise money. He was unknown outside the Hudson Valley communities he had quietly represented in the State Legislature for 10 years.
But Mr. Pataki, son of a postal worker and waitress, worked for the Republican nomination just as he worked every campaign he had ever run, all against incumbents, all victorious. He crisscrossed the state for months, meeting Republican leaders and building a small but loyal following. He was also the right candidate at the right time, according to Republican polls: a Roman Catholic from the suburbs with a record of opposing tax increases while supporting abortion rights, even though he voted against Medicaid funds for abortions in the Legislature.
In the end, he convinced the one Republican whose support truly counted, United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who hammered his nomination through the Republican State Convention in May.
His critics said the alliance represented everything that was wrong with Mr. Pataki: he was too pliable, too eager to make Faustian deals, too willing to let his brash patron dominate a campaign that should have been his own show.
But to his many friends, the alliance was a mark of a pragmatic politician, one prepared to campaign publicly beside Mr. D'Amato while working behind the scenes to shape his own strategy.
"The bottom line is that all this about him being an empty suit, that's all nonsense," said Vincent S. Vesce, an old friend who ran on the Pataki slate for Peekskill City Council 13 years ago. "This guy is down-to-earth, he cares, he has a vision."
Of his style, Mr. Pataki once said: "One of the reasons I think I've always gotten along with everybody is that I'm willing to listen and really think about it. I'm pretty confident in my judgment, but I'm always willing to listen."
George Elmer Pataki was born in Peekskill, a city of about 19,500 in northern Westchester County, on June 24, 1945. Both of his grandfathers worked for the Fleischmann's Company, and his father grew up in company housing near its yeast and gin plants along the Hudson River. Later, his paternal grandfather bought a fruit and vegetable farm on the city's outskirts, and Mr. Pataki was raised there along with a brother and 12 cousins.
He graduated from Peekskill High School in 1963, an erudite basketball player who won a scholarship to Yale. During summers he also worked for Fleischmann's, shoveling coal to run the generators and stacking bottles of gin for $3 an hour.
Mr. Pataki graduated from Yale with a degree in history and went to Columbia Law School, again on scholarship, where he was an editor on the law review.
In 1974, after a four-year stint with a Wall Street law firm, Mr. Pataki returned to Peekskill and opened a branch office for the White Plains-based law firm of Plunkett & Jaffe. Along the way he married Elizabeth Rowland, known as Libby, whom he met while they were body surfing, in a storm, off Long Island. They have four children: Emily, 15, Teddy, 12, Allison, 9, and Owen, 7. Mrs. Pataki is a former manager for Paine Webber who quit her job to raise the family. Teddy is named after Mr. Pataki's political idol, Teddy Roosevelt.
The family eventually moved into a Victorian mansion in the Putnam County hamlet of Garrison, a home that Mr. Pataki bought with $700,000 in profits from his real estate transactions. His real estate deals became an issue this year when the Cuomo campaign contended he illegally avoided paying taxes on profits, a charge Mr. Pataki has denied.
Long active in Republican politics, Mr. Pataki had helped on the gubernatorial campaigns of Nelson A. Rockefeller in 1970 and Malcolm Wilson in 1974. He also worked as a legislative aide to former State Senator Bernard G. Gordon and his successor, Mary B. Goodhue.
He first sought office in 1981 when he ran for Peekskill mayor on a slate with three Republican City Council candidates. Mr. Vesce recalled prepping Mr. Pataki for the first televised debate in Peekskill history before the election. "It was all 'ahs' and 'ums,' " he said of Mr. Pataki's delivery. "It was so bad I rushed to the kitchen looking for a knife to commit suicide."
Despite his unpolished speaking skills, which he has since burnished over the years, as well as the Democrats' edge in registered voters, Mr. Pataki and his allies handily defeated the incumbents and ushered in an era of Republican dominance in Peekskill politics that continues today. Mr. Pataki won re-election in 1983.
As Mayor, Mr. Pataki used a variety of incentives to bring real estate developers to Peekskill to help boost the local economy. After leaving the office, he set up a law practice with his brother, Louis Jr., that did business with, and profited from, some of those same developers -- a move that has brought criticism from political opponents.
In 1984, Mr. Pataki defeated another Democratic incumbent, Assemblyman William J. Ryan, and began the first of four terms in the Assembly. As a Republican in the Democratic-controlled house, he was often relegated to casting protest votes against tax increases and welfare spending. But he won praise from environmentalists for working to protect the Hudson River and from teachers unions for fighting to increase state aid to suburban schools.
In 1992, Mr. Pataki defeated his former mentor, Ms. Goodhue, in a bitter and closely fought Republican primary and went on to win the general election. Ms. Goodhue has accused Mr. Pataki of being a mudslinging campaigner, and she refused to support him this year.
But Mr. Pataki had plenty of supporters at a rally on Monday night. And it seemed only appropriate that the candidate, a virtuoso small-town politician performing in the Carnegie Hall of New York State races, should spend the final hours of his campaign with the hometown crowd in Peekskill.
Several hundred people gathered under balloons and bunting to cheer the local hero at a restaurant built in the old Fleischmann's gin distillery in Peekskill. As the crowd enclosed the weary but smiling Mr. Pataki, Tim Carey, a friend and political consultant, looked on admiringly.
"George is that kind of guy," he said.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: NEW YORK GOVERNOR;
Concession and Victory: Words of Pataki and Cuomo

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the concession speech of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo last night, as transcribed by The New York Times.
CUOMO Which brings me to my final thank-you, and that is to the people of the State of New York, this magnificent place. Long ago, long before our first victory in 1982, this state had already given me and my family more opportunity and reward than we had any right to expect. Then it added three terms as Governor of the greatest state in the nation. I don't have the words to describe the deep sense of gratitude and depth that I feel for that immense opportunity. 
 I had great plans for this state in the coming years and I have great hopes for her still, because of the strength of our people, the scope of the great gifts that nature has given us and all the good that we inherited from those who came before us. And the extraordinary things we were able to achieve for the people in just 12 years, despite two serious national recessions, and with a decade of disdain from Washington. We have enormous power here; we have a fantastic future potentially. I've surely made mistakes as Governor, but I'm as proud as I can be of what we have accomplished together and I'm just absolutely -- I'm absolutely convinced that there's enormous -- there's an enormous amount more we can do.
Now I have a regret, one main regret, this year: that I was not able to make the case clearly enough in this campaign to gain for you -- all of you -- the victory that your good work deserved. I'm sorry to have let you down because you deserved, you deserved another four years.
Now, my greatest hope, my, my greatest hope for this state and -- and maybe even for the nation beyond, the reason -- the reason we wanted to run, the reason we thought it was important is that we sensed all across this nation a negativism, a harshness, a divisiveness, a willingness to pit people against one another, even a cynicism that we didn't like. It's not appropriate for this country and it's certainly not appropriate for this great state.
We've been given too much, we have been too fortunate to become bitter and negative -- that's a dangerous thing. My great hope is that this state will grow together, put aside the divisions between upstate and downstate, between communities, between colors, between sexes, between sexual orientations and that we will remember what the proper direction is for us as a state and for the nation and -- and -- and please understand that this state has known from the beginning what the proper direction is; it's part of your seal. It was the slogan that helped launch the state.
The word is excelsior, and I'll leave you with words that I've used over and over all through this campaign that say it much better than I could say it: Where are we supposed to go? What direction are we supposed to travel in? E. B. White told us: remember New York is to the nation what the church spire is to the village -- the symbol of aspiration and faith, the white plume saying the way is up, not down, not backward, up. Excelsior! Let's keep going up.
Thank you. God bless you. Thank you for everything. Thank you.
Following are excerpts from the victory speech of George E. Pataki, as transcribed by The New York Times.
PATAKI And I'd also like to thank someone, a United States Senator -- a United States Senator who on Jan. 1 will become chairman of the Senate Banking Committee; someone who has suffered unfair attacks during the course of this campaign. Let me just say to him, and to everyone out there: You can call me, Al.
D'AMATO I hear you.
PATAKI God bless you. . . .
Let me at this time also thank Gov. Mario Cuomo. Governor, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your kind words this evening. The people of this state, all the people of New York State, salute you, Governor, for your service to all of us. Thank you for that service. . . .
You know, the people of this state voted for change. The people of this country voted for change, all across the country -- and thank you for doing that. Let me pledge to you New Yorkers, all New Yorkers -- upstate, downstate, the New Yorkers in the city, that I will work with you to bring about the change you voted for today. We are going to have a government that serves the people instead of a people that serve the government. And that is a change that we will make.
We pledge -- we pledge to control state spending and cut taxes. And let me tell you, we are going to do that, we are going to cut the taxes. And one of my top priorities is going to be to make sure that you can walk the streets and play in the parks and have your kids go to school, and live at home in safety, because we are going to change the criminal justice system of this state . . . Let me just make one thing simple: I love this state, I am very proud of New York, I am very proud to be a New Yorker, I am very grateful for the opportunity that this state has given me, a mailman's kid from Peekskill, to stand before you tonight as the next Governor.
If there's one thing -- if there's one thing this campaign has stood for day in and day out it's about again restoring people's confidence in the future of this state, again restoring their belief that the best of this state is ahead of us, that we can again become number one in economic opportunity and new jobs, that we can again become number one in the quality of our schools and the safety of our streets. That we can again be a place where dreams come true -- for ourselves, for our children, for our grandchildren, and for all New Yorkers.
With your help, we're going to make the changes. We're going to bring this state back. And we are again going to be very proud, all of us from all parts of this state, to call this the great Empire State.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: THE NATION
THE CAPITAL;
Barry Rebounds From Disgrace to Win Again in Washington

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Wednesday, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Former Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. last night regained the office he had left in disgrace almost five years ago, but not without widespread defections of black voters to his Republican opponent, Carol Schwartz.
At 12:48 A.M., with 73 percent of the precincts reporting, the vote was:
Barry . . . 54%
Schwartz . . . 44%
The margin was enough to force Mrs. Schwartz to concede shortly after 11 P.M. last night. 
 "We have dreamed the impossible dream and made the impossible possible," said Mr. Barry, who left office in 1990 after being arrested on charges of possession of cocaine. In an emotional victory speech with a theme of unifying ethnic groups to rebuild the city, Mr. Barry said: "We have come together as never before. Now is not the time to gloat in our success. Now is the time to build bridges together and help me rebuild Washington together."
In a city in which more than two-thirds of the voters are black and the vast majority are Democrats, his victory also reflected a strong abandonment by many of the black voters who had supported him in the September primary.
In her second campaign against Mr. Barry, who is black, Mrs. Schwartz, a white candidate, ran unusually well in several predominantly black wards of the city in which Mr. Barry was presumed to have built invincible strength. According to a count of early votes, in Ward 6, a predominantly black middle-class area, Mrs. Schwartz drew unusually large support: Mr. Barry led her there by just 5,751 to 4,776 votes. By contrast, in Ward 8, a largely black but lower-income area, in which Mr. Barry lives, he led in the early count by 5,572 to 496.
One thing that is certain is that her showing was the strongest of anyone who had ever opposed Mr. Barry in a general election for mayor. Eight years ago, she finished second, with 32 percent of the vote.
Mr. Barry's victory seemed virtually certain since the primary on Sept. 13, when he defeated six other Democrats, including Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, who won election four years ago on the promise of clean government and change. Mr. Barry's plurality of 47 percent became the surest sign that voters were willing to overlook his arrest for smoking crack cocaine in a downtown hotel with a woman who was not his wife, the incident that drove him from office in 1990.
After he was convicted on a single charge of drug possession, he served six months in prison.
But if his misdemeanor conviction, drug rehabilitation and political redemption served as the emotional backdrop to the general election, more urgent issues affecting the city dominated the daily debate between him and Mrs. Schwartz, including how to satisfy the Congressional order to cut $140 million in spending from the city budget.
While Mrs. Schwartz, a 54-year-old widow of a prominent Washington lawyer, attacked Mr. Barry's proposals as worn out and ineffective, Mr. Barry tied together the emotional and pragmatic themes of his campaign, asking voters who could better to lead the redemption of a city than someone who had pronounced himself redeemed.
For Mrs. Schwartz, it was an uphill fight all the way, shaped by an electorate in which Democrats outnumber Republicans more than 10-to-1 and blacks outnumber whites more than 2-to-1. She battled Mr. Barry on issues facing the city, making her main thrust the constant reminder that the city and its services had deteriorated in his last two terms in office.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: THE HOUSE
THE VOTERS;
In Chicago (Truly!), Many Stay Home

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Precinct captains stood outside nearly empty polling places. They looked at their lists and checked off names. They got people rides to the polls. They got babysitters for voters' children. They slipped reminders on front porches and palm cards in people's hands. They got doors slammed in their faces and weak promises from voters who vowed they would vote but did not.
By the end of Election Day in a city where politics is a blood sport more important than even baseball, less than half of the voters had cast ballots for state and Congressional races that politicians said could change the face of Washington. 
 "They're really not interested this time, to tell you the truth," said John Amerin, a Democratic precinct captain on the Northwest Side.
There are many reasons. Two Congressmen on the Chicago ballot are under indictment -- Dan Rostenkowski on charges of fraud and embezzlement, Mel Reynolds on charges of sexual assault of a minor. (Mr. Rostenkowski lost while Mr. Reynolds faced no opposition.) Voters say negative advertising has eroded whatever respect they had for some candidates. And this year, "crook" and "politician" have been used interchangeably in what now seems an echo chamber of discontent.
In interviews today, voters told why they were sitting out this election, why they were drinking espresso or running errands or heading to the gym instead of going to the polls in one of the tightest, meanest midterm elections in years.
They spoke in the venomous tones that have characterized the campaign. "Politicians are finaglers, liars, jugglers and seat-holders," said Lloyd Jackson, a welder. "At election time, tongues wag both ways. Politics have done absolutely nothing for me."
Some said they were simply too busy. "I just graduated from school, I work 65, 70 hours a week, I've got student loans to pay back," said Keith Frainey, a psychologist. "What mainly interests me is trying to make a living."
Some said they could not stomach the ballot choices. "The candidates are unworthy because they run simply by attacking each other instead of saying what they will do," said Bob Makey, a real estate developer trying to gather the energy to drag himself to the polls. "I don't even know most of the candidates. The press has discouraged me from voting because it looks like it's going to be a Republican landslide and there is nothing I can do about it. People are frustrated, emasculated, and there's no hope anymore."
Joseph Paulus, a store manager in training, said that he had voted for President Clinton but that he was too turned off to vote this time. "It's the same old garbage," Mr. Paulus said. "Nothing changes. I'm just so frustrated and fed up."
He said he wants radical change. "We need to do away with Congress," he said. "It should be a lottery just like jury duty. You should be drafted to go to Washington. That way we would get reporters and teachers and farmers and businessmen. It would be a better representation of the country."
Sarah Dusek, a paralegal, said she felt guilty because she was a political science major in college. But, she said, "I'm not going to vote because I don't know who's running and I'm fed up with all the mudslinging, awful TV commercials."
Even people who decided to vote had a hard time deciding what to do once they got inside the booth. "I know I should vote, but I'm not excited or anything," said Charisse Landise, a shiatsu practitioner.
She sat with a cup of coffee, studying the front page of The Chicago Tribune before walking to the voting booth. "I'm looking for some type of reference point of who is declaring what," Ms. Landise said. "I'm in the dark. I'm looking for who I should vote for. Just clues."
This time of year in Chicago, a city where people really do call their alderman's office when their trash is not picked up, there should be a forest of yard signs and arguments over candidates at every dinner table. "Normally Chicago is abuzz this time of year," said Richard Mell, an alderman on Chicago's Northwest Side. "This is a strange one. I just don't see the enthusiasm."
So the precinct captains have had to work a little harder. "We're dragging everybody out to vote and hoping they're sympathetic," Mr. Mell said. "We drive them if they need a ride and babysit for them if they need a babysitter.'
Cozella Ireland, an election judge on Chicago's South Side, said she spent all day Sunday trying to get people in her predominantly black district excited about voting.
"I passed out literature about Nelson Mandela and the history of what it took for Africans to vote," Ms. Ireland said. "The literature had pictures of mothers with children on their backs and shoulders walking for three days to vote. And these people live right around the corner and won't come."
In Chicago, where nearly half of all voters are black, Democrats and Republicans have gone so far as to try to woo blacks with rap campaign commercials. (Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican who was re-elected, stiffly did his own rap in a radio spot: "Well, my name is Jim and I've just been dissed/So I've got to respond 'cause my point was missed.")
Velma Rivera, a nursing assistant who is black, said it was a further insult in an election year when issues like crime and welfare seemed to be assaults on them. "I'm 32 years old," Ms. Rivera said. "Rap is for my 16-year-old son. It just shows what they think of us." She said she was not voting.
The apathy crosses wards and races. "They just don't care," said Patricia Cullerton, an alderman on Chicago's Northwest Side. "They're saying their lives are too busy to vote. They feel politicians don't help them anyway, so it doesn't matter."
Russ Gibbs, a marketing executive who voted for Ross Perot in the 1992 Presidential election, said he saw no reason to go. "It doesn't seem like there are that many issues pertinent to me," Mr. Gibbs said. "The economy is doing pretty good. I'm not really affected by crime. If you're not in any particular pain, you're not going to vote. It's going to go on without me."
Steve Joslyn was beyond apathetic about the election. "I don't even know when it is," said Mr. Joslyn, a chef at a North Side restaurant, who said he did not have time to vote. "It's Thursday, isn't it?"

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: NEW YORK GOVERNOR
CUOMO;
Governor, Philosophical, Concedes and Soldiers On

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
He never prayed for victory on his final Election Day, the most sorrowful day in a career that had known few such moments of defeat. Instead, said Mario M. Cuomo, he fashioned a different prayer.
"The prayer we say is not, 'Lord, let me win,' " he said, "but the prayer we say is 'Lord, let me understand the outcome and deal with it.' " 
 That was at noon on Election Day, scant hours before the final tally of votes that abruptly ended a political career that once seemed boundless. But even then, the Governor seemed to struggle with the possibility of loss, working to understand an electorate that had failed to grasp a truth that seemed to him so obvious.
 At midnight, when it came time to concede, he still seemed frustrated and puzzled by a national cynicism and bitterness so alien to his nature but so powerful that it had cut him down.
"The reason we wanted to run," he said in his final speech, "the reason we thought it was important, is that we sense all across this nation a negativism, a harshness, a divisiveness, a willingness to pit people against one another, even a cynicism that we didn't like. It's not appropriate for this country, and it's certainly not appropriate for this great state. We've been given too much, we have been too fortunate to have become bitter and negative."
As he spoke, there was no trace of personal bitterness on his face, riddled with the lines and caverns and bags that had long shielded his emotions from public view. He thanked scores of family members and friends and aides, he thanked the entire state. He even, amazingly, thanked and praised the media. To the very end, there was a determined old-world stoicism that he joked about earlier in the day.
"Wistful?" he lectured a reporter. "Wistful? I'm from Queens. We don't get wistful. We don't get wan."
He took upon his own shoulders the responsibility for defeat, apologizing in the face of audience protest for letting down his supporters.
"I have one main regret this year," he said, as tears flowed down the faces of those around him. "That I was not able to make the case clearly enough in this campaign to gain for you, all of you, the victory that all of your good work deserved."
Staff members said he was just as composed after the polls closed and the first, ominous returns began trickling in. He had the television set on in his suite at the New York Sheraton, occasionally switching off the election news to watch the Knicks game, chatting amiably with family and friends as if the world was not closing in. Just before conceding, he dropped by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's hotel suite and jokingly told a mayoral aide to get married.
And perhaps, for a man who willingly gave up a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court and a chance to be President, it was not the end of the world. His innermost ambitions and dreams were always so concealed that perhaps despite the fervor of his campaign, he could imagine a life outside of government. Though he confessed to a sleepless night on Monday, he said it was caused by the mundane possibilities of unemployment, not the thought of political cataclysm.
"You don't sleep," he said, just after he voted with his wife in Hollis, Queens. "You have to think about what happens if you win, what happens if you lose. If you win, there's a tremendous amount of work to do. If you lose, you have to find work, you have to find a place to live. So."
Was he really spending the night before his last election worrying about real estate, how to stay busy, how to make a living? Throughout the campaign he had insisted that voters not support him out of concern for the Cuomo family, but out of concern for the state. But it was not in his nature to admit that his insomnia resulted from a profound fear, a dread of something larger than a personal upheaval.
Mr. Cuomo had painted himself for weeks as the candidate of optimism, the only one of the pack to foresee hope for New York State. Even on the last day of his last campaign, he could hardly be seen predicting any less for himself or, for that matter, life under his successor.
"We have enormous power here," he said in the ballroom of the Sheraton, where so many of his campaign speeches had been delivered. "We have a fantastic future, potentially. I've surely made mistakes as Governor, but I'm as proud as can be for what we've accomplished together."
His Democratic colleagues, themselves struggling for an explanation that the Governor never sought, insisted that the voters had not rejected his vision, but had simply been restless.
"I think it was a general feeling that people said enough," said Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn. "Even though people respect the Governor for his integrity, for his vision, they're saying, 'We want to change something.' They may be buying a pig in a poke, but they want a change."
If there was a vagueness to that kind of thinking, a fuzziness of mind, it was precisely what Mr. Cuomo had always railed against in his 12 years as Governor. When reporters asked him questions that were less than perfectly formed, he lashed out. If a voter said he opposed the Governor because he wanted change, Mr. Cuomo demanded to know precisely what needed to be changed, and how, and under what circumstances, and who would do the changing. But he could not demand his own precision of mind from an electorate who saw him living on a different mental plane.
"This is a system that rewards involvement and punishes aloofness," he said yesterday afternoon. The context was one of urging people to vote, but he might as well have been talking about himself and his final separation from a populace who no longer shared his expansive vision of the state's possibilities.
"You stay away from the system," he said, "and it hurts you."

HEADLINE: U.S. Agency Is Accused of Bias in Making South Africa Grants

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Several current or former officials in the Agency for International Development are engaged in a dispute over whether the agency has improperly sought to exclude non-black groups both in the United States and in South Africa when it awards grants to aid that African nation.
Paul Neifert, an A.I.D. official who was transferred out of South Africa after criticizing agency policies there, complained that just when the new Government of President Nelson Mandela was seeking to build a country free of discrimination, A.I.D. was increasingly basing its grants on the color of recipients. 
 In a scathing article in the November issue of Foreign Service Journal, Mr. Neifert pointed to several instances in which the agency had strained to insure that grants went to black-led organizations. He wrote that after the agency adopted its new policy in mid-1992, A.I.D. managers in South Africa informed their staff members that "those uncomfortable with the new Afro-centric direction" of agency programs "should leave."
He wrote about one agency official who, eager to award grants to black groups, asked in an open meeting what it would take to get a white South African to resign as leader of an A.I.D.-funded organization.
In interviews today, senior A.I.D. officials denied any improper actions, asserting that they were merely following American laws that allow favoring black-led organizations when awarding A.I.D. contracts. The agency plans to provide about $200 million in aid to South Africa over each of the next three years.
"They're alleging that the U.S. has made a policy decision to utilize only African-American groups to work in South Africa, and that's just not true," said John F. Hicks, A.I.D.'s assistant administrator for Africa.
Mr. Hicks said, for instance, that it makes sense to award grants to black schools, like Howard University, to help improve South African education programs because they have a lot to offer with their long history of teaching students who have suffered discrimination.
Mr. Hicks noted that of the $132.6 million his agency has granted so far this year to assist South Africa, $62 million has been channeled through American groups. About $11 million of this has gone to black-led or black-owned groups, while the other $51 million went to groups that are not black-led.
But the agency's critics say its affirmative action policies have gone so far that they have sought to exclude Asian-Americans and multi-racial organizations in South Africa from winning contracts.
Last April, Harry Johnson, a 27-year agency veteran, now retired, sent a letter to A.I.D.'s top official, J. Brian Atwood, to complain that its grants to South Africa were being improperly skewed to favor the "African community, as opposed to the 'Colored' or 'Asian' communities," which he said were also considered disadvantaged.
Mr. Johnson complained that managers blocked consultants' recommendations to grant money to a multi-racial business group, rather than a black-led organization, to teach skills to black-owned small businesses in South Africa.
Several Republicans in Congress have joined the attack. Accusing the agency of engaging in a frenzy of "political correctness," Representative Daniel Burton, an Indiana Republican, said, "The South African people deserve better than to have themselves turned into a trough of spoils and rich contracts."
Mr. Hicks sought to downplay the criticism. "They're challenging a policy that is trying to work with black-led groups to the maximum extent possible," he said.

HEADLINE: Aristide's Cabinet Is Sworn and Pledges to Get to Work

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Nov. 8

 BODY:
After nearly a month of highly publicized consultations with friends and foes and a bit of old-fashioned politicking behind closed doors, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide finally has a Prime Minister, a full Cabinet and a Parliament-approved plan of action.
At a ceremony at the National Palace this morning, before guests who included Haitian politicians, foreign diplomats and Maj. Gen. David Meade, commander of the American troops here, Prime Minister-designate Smarck Michel and his Cabinet took their oaths of office and pledged to begin work immediately on the daunting task of rebuilding a country devastated by military dictatorship, corruption and harsh economic sanctions. 
 "I thank the Haitian people for their patience," Mr. Michel, 57, a businessman, said. "I hope I don't disappoint you."
The swearing-in followed a vote of confidence late Monday night in which Parliament formally endorsed Mr. Michel, his 17-member Cabinet and the program of government he had submitted for the lawmakers' approval.
That plan, markedly more mainstream in tone than the approach President Aristide took during his first tenure in office, emphasizes the establishment of democratic institutions and the rebuilding of the economy through market forces and foreign assistance.
Mr. Michel was selected as Prime Minister on Oct. 24, but Parliament, which still has a large contingent of former supporters of the military junta that ousted President Aristide in 1991, dragged its heels on his confirmation through a variety of procedural devices. That forced the President to meet with opposition legislators, as well as factions from his own coalition, and appeal for their cooperation.
President Aristide was eager to have his Cabinet confirmed and installed because a delegation from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank is here this week to discuss the economic reconstruction of Haiti. Had the Cabinet appointments and program not been ratified, it would not have been clear who had the authority to meet with the visitors and make commitments on behalf of the President.
In the end, the President was able to retain close associates whom he originally appointed while in exile in most of the important economic posts, including Finance Minister Marie-Michele Rey, Planning Minister Jean-Marie Cherestal and Agriculture Minister Agronome F. Severin. The Foreign Minister, Claudette Werleigh, and Interior Minister, Rene Prosper, also are carry-overs.
As his Defense Minister, President Aristide named a retired general, Wilton Lerisson. Today's swearing-in ceremony was attended by Maj. Gen. Jean-Claude Duperval, who replaced Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras as Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces last month, and other members of the high command. They listened attentively as the President urged them to work "hand in hand" with the civilian authorities.
Evoking the three years of state-sponsored terror and repression Haiti has just suffered through, President Aristide said his goal was for all Haitians to "feel like they have security" and are "living in a country where their hearts are not pounding, but are beating calmly." He pledged that his Government would work "not for one or two people, or one group of people, but for each and every person."
In an effort to reach out to constituencies that his predecessors largely ignored, including women, intellectuals and the approximately one million Haitians who live abroad, President Aristide also created four new Cabinet posts. These are the Ministries for Women's Affairs, the Haitian diaspora, Culture and Public Functions, which was spun off from the Planning Ministry.
The new Cabinet also includes one minister, Marc Henri Rousseau-Francois of Public Works, who held the same post under the military dictatorship that overthrew President Aristide on Sept. 30 1991. Another member, Trade and Industry Minister Maurice Lafortune, who was elected last month as president of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce, served under one of the military governments that held power before Father Aristide's election.
The United States Ambassador to Haiti, William L. Swing, described the appointees as "a good, strong group of people" and praised the Haitian President for assembling "a very broad-based" Government that included people outside his Lavalas movement.
Mr. Swing also promised that the Clinton Administration and President Aristide's other foreign allies would do their best to help the new Government succeed during the 15 months remaining in his term.
"I believe Haiti has the best opportunity in its modern history to build democracy and a sound economy," Mr. Swing said. "In contrast to a lot of other transitional countries, the political resolve of the Haitian people and the international community is being matched by commensurate economic and financial resources to support them at this time of watershed change."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: GOVERNOR;
Promise to Repeal Income Tax Helps Rowland and G.O.P. to Apparent Victory

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Wednesday, Nov. 9

 BODY:
John G. Rowland, a Republican who has vowed to repeal the state's three-year-old income tax, was elected governor of Connecticut yesterday with little more than a third of the vote, defeating William E. Curry Jr., a Democrat, and two other major candidates.
Mr. Rowland's narrow victory puts a Republican in the state's top office for the first time in two decades. And it means that an income tax introduced in 1991 -- the major legacy of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. -- may once again be the focus of debate in the State Legislature. 
 The election also raises questions about the viabilty of Governor Weicker's third party, A Connecticut Party, which was established in 1990 for his bid for office. His heir apparent, Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark, appears to have failed to garner the 20 percent needed to hold onto its major-party status, and the party is likely to cease being a significant player in the political scene.
The fourth major candidate was Tom Scott, a leader of the anti-income tax movement running as an independent.
With 99 percent of the 820 precincts reporting, the vote was:
Rowland . . . 36%
Curry . . . 33%
Groark . . . 19%
Scott . . . 11%
In other races, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman was easily re-elected over his Republican opponent, Gerald Labriola, a retired pediatrician and former state senator, 67 percent to 31 percent, with 91 percent of the votes counted.
Mr. Rowland declared victory at 11:25 P.M. at a celebration at the Sheraton Hotel in Waterbury, saying that his campaign marks a new era for Connecticut.
"We ask you all across the state -- Republicans, Democrats and unaffiliated voters -- to put your courage and your trust in the free-enterprise system," he said. "Let the free-enterprise system get us through the economic recovery. Let's try trusting individuals and trusting cities and towns to take care of our problems rather than rely on Big Daddy government in Hartford and in Washington."
A few minutes later, when a reporter asked if he would be able to govern effectively with such a small plurality, he responded: "I anticipated that would be the very first question from the press. I think we have a mandate if you look at the amount of support we got in a four-way race. And the bottom line is whether its 36, 38 or 48, I'm going to be the governor."
In Hartford, about the same time as Mr. Rowland declared victory, Mr. Curry conceded defeat.
"This was a hard night," he said, adding, "I wish to congratulate John Rowland on his victory, and to wish his administration well in contending with all the very difficult challenges that confront our state."
Mr. Rowland's victory was apparently accompanied by a Republican gain of at least one seat in the State Senate, meaning that Mr. Rowland effectively has a majority in that house. The Democrats picked up a number of seats in the State House of Representatives, increasing their majority.
It was difficult to gauge tonight how much the income tax was the turning point in the race.
According to exit interviews conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of the four television networks and The Associated Press, 60 percent of the 1,153 repondents favored repealing the income tax and 38 percent wanted to keep it. But the survey also showed that people did not necessarily use the income tax as a litmus test. About 35 percent of those opposed to it voted for either Mr. Curry or Mrs. Groark, both supporters of the income tax.
Mr. Rowland, 37, was the front-runner since announcing his candidacy in January. A former three-term Congressman who lost a close contest for governor in 1990, he began this campaign better known than any of his opponents and quickly developed a fund-raising advantage that his competitors never came close to matching.
As of Oct. 25, Mr. Rowland had raised more than $3.3 million, 40 percent more than Mr. Curry and more than triple what Mrs. Groark had raised.
And with an electorate frightened about crime and angry over taxes, Mr. Rowland's message about the "wrong people being afraid" and his promise to repeal the income tax proved popular.
"Now is our time," Mr. Rowland said in July when he received his party's nomination and appeared confident that he would become the first Republican governor of Connecticut since Thomas J. Meskill's victory in 1970.
Still, the race involved substantial hurdles for Mr. Rowland that few would have predicted.
Over the summer, Mr. Rowland was faced with an unexpected primary challenge from Secretary of the State Pauline R. Kezer, who aggressively attacked Mr. Rowland for his work as a Capitol Hill consultant over the last four years and for his 108 overdrafts from the House Bank in the 1980's. Mr. Rowland defeated her decisively and then won her support for the general election.
More recently, Mr. Rowland had to deal with controversy over an argument he had with his former wife, Deborah, on April 10 that prompted her to call the police to her home in Middlebury. The incident made headlines when The Hartford Courant tried to obtain a copy of the police report, and the police chief, a Rowland supporter, and Mr. Rowland opposed its release.
For weeks, the legal battle over whether the report should be made public dominated campaign news, and although a judge ultimately ruled that the report should not be released before the election, the controversy appeared to have damaged Mr. Rowland's support among women.
Mr. Rowland tried to blunt the damage, running a commercial that cast himself as a victim, saying he was being smeared by The Courant and his "political enemies."
Mr. Rowland also benefited from the dynamics of a four-way race that could have worked against him. Many had predicted that Mr. Rowland's bid had suffered a fatal blow when Mr. Scott, a conservative Republican who led the fight against the income tax, entered the race as an independent in September.
Polls have shown that Mr. Scott took away some of Mr. Rowland's more conservative supporters, and Mr. Scott was a constant thorn in Mr. Rowland's side during debates, arguing that Mr. Rowland was not truly committed to eliminating the income tax. Indeed, Mr. Rowland never detailed all the budget cuts that would be needed to eliminate the income tax, which provides about $2.5 billion to the state, roughly one-fourth of its revenues.
But Mr. Rowland reacted quickly to Mr. Scott. Early in the campaign, when Mr. Scott first threatened to run, Mr. Rowland shifted his position on the income tax, promising to repeal it, after initially ruling out such an option. For the remainder of the campaign, Mr. Rowland delivered a conservative fiscal message that included tax cuts while insisting they could be instituted without severe cuts in government services, as Mr. Scott favored.
As the campaign came to a close, Mr. Curry and Mrs. Groark fought for the anti-Rowland vote, with Mr. Curry insisting that a vote for Mrs. Groark would help elect Mr. Rowland. For her part, Mrs. Groark argued that voters should follow their hearts, rather than "waste" the vote on their second choice, just to block Mr. Rowland.
And Mr. Rowland managed to drown out the other candidates' messages with a media blitz of 14 television commercials that began at the end of the summer.
The ad campaign conveyed his message of an income-tax repeal, tougher sentences for criminals and an overhaul of the welfare system, but it also defined Mr. Curry for many voters. In five attack ads, Mr. Rowland portrayed Mr. Curry as a tax-and-spend liberal who was soft on crime and part of government as usual.
"A vote for Curry is a vote for more money out of your pocket," Mr. Rowland said in one commercial, ignoring Mr. Curry's pledge to reduce property taxes by 25 percent, a centerpiece of Mr. Curry's campaign that never seemed to capture the public's imagination.
Mr. Curry responded to some of the spots, but he was not able to equal Mr. Rowland's advertising barrage, and his two attempts to attack Mr. Rowland for his consulting work and overdrafts apparently did not have much impact.
The victory is something of a vindication for Mr. Rowland, as many of his supporters believe that he was unjustly deprived of the job in 1990 because of Mr. Weicker's decision to abandon the Republican Party and run as an independent.
In that election, Mr. Rowland received 37 percent to Mr. Weicker's 40 percent. Since then, Mr. Rowland has attributed the loss to perceptions that he was mean and to anger raised by his threat to lay off state employees to balance the budget.
In this election, Mr. Rowland projected a softer, more moderate image and promised that he would not lay off state employees. His commercials sometimes featured him in casual dress, with soft piano music in the background.
"People are afraid of losing their jobs," he said. "We're losing our streets to crime. But it doesn't have to be that way. More than anything else, I want to bring hope back to Connecticut."

HEADLINE: World Bank Approves Loan to Help Russia Clean Up Pollution

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
The World Bank today approved its first loan to Russia aimed at cleaning up some of the country's contaminated rivers, polluted industrial sites and toxic waste dumps, and said it was the first step in a broad program to undo seven decades of environmental mismanagement.
By international standards the loan is small, about $110 million. But bank officials, who have been heavily criticized for financing huge infrastructure projects in the developing world with little regard for their environmental effects, insisted today that the loan symbolized a change of direction that took place several years ago in the bank's lending, and is being speeded. 
 The loan, combined with $45 million in investments from newly privatized businesses in Russia and $90 million in donations from the United States, the European Union and other other nations, would soon be felt in some of Russia's most fouled urban areas.
"This is an important first step that focuses on a few areas where the need is critical," said Roger Batstone, the bank's principal environmental engineer for the project. "This is the first installment of a large program of environmental lending for the Russian Federation."
Russia's environmental problems are tied directly to decades of central planning that ignored environmental concerns in the failed effort to increase the country's industrial output. Underpriced energy, economists say, only worsened the problem, as economically inefficient factories spewed enormous amounts of untreated exhausts and chemical wastes into the atmosphere.
The bank said today that 43 Russian cities were in urgent need of relief from air pollution, and that Russian industry discharged more sodium dioxide, the substance that causes acid rain, than all the factories in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France combined. Deforestation is widespread, largely because so many trees are still harvested for firewood, and fish harvests are declining because of pollution and the diversion of water for irrigation.
The World Bank program will focus on three regions: the Upper Volga, the North Caucasus and the Urals. "These are areas where there is some local commitment to cleaning things up," Mr. Batstone said, "so we believe they are good test areas."
Nonetheless, nearly half the project funds will be spent outside of Russia, for foreign environmental cleanup equipment and foreign consultants. The first step will be to establish a database of environmental hazards, and to develop plans for water-quality management in several regions.
The bank's president, Lewis Preston, is traveling in Russia, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan this week to discuss their transition to market economies. Mr. Preston has been arguing in recent months that the bank's critics have overblown its past lack of interest in environmental issues, noting that in the last four years it has spent $2.7 billion for environmental projects. Nearly half that figure, however, was spent last year. The bank issues about $17 billion in loans each year.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Chrysler Switch to New Mini-Vans

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HIGHLAND PARK, Mich., Nov. 8

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation expects to lose about 60,000 sales of its highly profitable mini-vans in 1995 because it will temporarily shut two assembly plants to prepare for new models, company officials said today.
Auto industry analysts on Wall Street believe Chrysler makes $5,000 to $7,500 on every mini-van it sells. Taking the lower figure, that means the No. 3 auto maker could lose at least $300 million because of the lost production and sales. 
 The cutback will cost Chrysler about 12 percent of its mini-van sales, which it predicts will reach 500,000 in the United States this year.
Wall Street auto stock analysts were expecting a production decline in the range Chrysler announced today. And no one is urging Chrysler to rush the introduction of its new mini-van model. "It's a major changeover, and Chrysler's got to do it right," said Michael P. Ward, auto industry analyst with Kidder Peabody in New York. "So when in doubt, slow down."
Chrysler's shares slipped 37.5 cents today, to $46.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Chrysler may not return to full production of mini-vans in North America until the third quarter of next year, the company said today.
"We're going to go through a huge shortage of mini-vans in the first six months next year," said E. Thomas Pappert, Chrysler's vice president for sales and service, in a meeting with reporters today at Chrysler headquarters here. Chrysler expects the new mini-vans to begin reaching dealers in small numbers by March.
Competition has intensified in the mini-van market that Chrysler defined and dominated. Since introducing its new Windstar mini-van earlier this year, the Ford Motor Company has eroded Chrysler's market share. The Honda Motor Company is now bringing a new mini-van to the United States that is not expected to take much marker share.
Separately, Chrysler announced today that it expects the United States car and truck market to grow to 16.5 million units in 1995, up about 1 million units from this year. That 1995 estimate was significantly down from Chrysler's previous, more bullish, projection of 17 million in June, although it was still above most industry forecasts.
Chrysler said it expected interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve to restrain sales.
Chrysler now makes mini-vans in two assembly plants, one in St. Louis and the other in Windsor, Ontario. It is refurbishing another plant in St. Louis to being producing the new mini-vans in February. It will close the existing St. Louis mini-van plan early next year and plans to begin producing full-size pickups there beginning in the third quarter of 1995.
The Canadian mini-van plant is scheduled to close in the second quarter, and start up again in the third quarter.
While Chrysler would not estimate the impact of the shutdowns on its earnings, Mr. Pappert said the shortage would disprove the notion that the mini-van is Chrysler's only crown jewel. "That myth will shatter over the next 18 months," he said. Increased production of vehicles like the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Dodge Neon subcompact, and Chrysler Cirrus compact sedan should help offset the blow to earnings, he said.
At full capacity, the mini-van plants will be able to produce up to 645,000 vehicles a year in North America, about the same number they can produce now. Since Chrysler expects the mini-van segment to continue to grow beyond this year's level of 1.3 million units, however, it will likely lose some market share.
While the mini-van market is hotly contested in the United States, announcements today by all three domestic auto makers suggest that in China, at least for the moment, all mini-vans are equal. Chrysler, Ford and the General Motors Corporation each announced today that they would sell 700 mini-vans to China during the 1995 model year.
Each of the three auto makers reached agreement to sell the mini-vans with Vice Premier Li Lanqing, who is visiting Detroit this week.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: NEW JERSEY;
New Jersey Congressional Races

 BODY:

2d DISTRICT
Lobiondo, the Republican, Wins
Over Democratic Newcomer
Frank A. Lobiondo, a Republican running with widespread Democratic support, handily captured the Second Congressional District seat being vacated by William J. Hughes, the Democrat, who is retiring. 
The district, covering most of the state's forested southern counties, is a traditional Republican stronghold, but its politics have shifted toward the center in recent years with the rise of new communities around Atlantic City.
Mr. Lobiondo, a State Assemblyman and family trucking company executive, bested the Democrat, Louis N. Maguzzu.
The race was won on the Republican issues that have dominated much of New Jersey's political debate this year -- lower taxes, less spending and reduced Federal government. Mr. Lobiondo was also aided by his stature as a member of the State Assembly and former member of the Cumberland County legislature.
Mr. Maguzzu, a Vineland lawyer, was a political newcomer who has never held elected office; he was also something of an insurgent in the district's Democratic Party, not originally supported.
Local labor unions were open in their support for the Republican: "Vote for the Two Franks," their literature said, referring to Mr. Lobiondo and to Frank Lautenberg, the Democratic Senator running for re-election to a third term.
Mr. Maguzzu stressed gun control and fighting crime in his campaign.
 
8th DISTRICT
Martini the Victor Over Klein
Bill Martini, a Republican city councilman from Clifton, claimed victory in a closely watched race for the House seat representing the Eighth Congressional District over Herbert Klein, a first-term Democratic incumbent.
At 10:50 P.M., Mr. Martini appeared before supporters at a hall in Totowa and said, "I think it's time that we have a chance to bring forth to the American people the policies that they want, the policies of opportunity."
Mr. Klein conceded about 15 minutes later, saying: "Politics is like the ocean, it ebbs and it flows. Unfortunately, we were in a down period, but I know that I have served with pride."
Throughout the campaign, both candidates had stressed issues of crime, taxes and the problems with unemployment in a part of the state that has not registered the same economic recovery as the southern counties. The Eighth District was redrawn two years ago to embrace some of the prosperous, and Republican-leaning, suburbs of Glen Ridge and Verona, offsetting the district's urban cores in Patterson and Passaic. The Republican Party had long hoped that the district's more balanced electorate would make the Eighth a place where the party could dislodge the first-term Democrat before he became entrenched.
Mr. Klein sought to protect himself from Republican charges of favoring taxes and spending by opposing tax increases during his first term, and by sometimes voting against President Clinton's programs on the grounds that they were too expensive.
But he cited President Clinton's recently enacted crime bill as evidence that his party was able to take a hard stance on the crime issue, while Mr. Martini characterized the crime bill as laden with "pork."

HEADLINE: 'Bell Curve' Critics Say Early I.Q. Isn't Destiny

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Are children who score poorly on standardized tests of ability fated to lives of poverty, crime and social squalor?
Charles Murray and Richard J. Herrnstein, authors of the controversial book, "The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life" (the Free Press), make no secret of their pessimism about the prospects for elevating the underclass. "For the foreseeable future," they wrote, "the problems of low cognitive ability are not going to be solved by outside intervention." 
 But many social scientists, saying they are dismayed by the book's conclusions, believe that intervention can make a big difference -- that study after study of children living in poverty suggests that early attention can improve performance.
"Murray and Herrnstein just ignored the evidence," said James Heckman, an economist at the University of Chicago. "They are 180 degrees off course."
Much of "The Bell Curve" is devoted to showing that "cognitive ability," as measured by I.Q. and other intelligence tests, is a powerful predictor of everything from earnings to criminal behavior to competence as parents. Were it possible to make "people smarter with the right kind of help," they wrote, their own research would "constitute a clarion call for programs to do so."
They concluded that Head Start-style preschool enrichment for disadvantaged children held little promise because the gains they made in them quickly faded. Improving the quality of schools (where quality is measured by class size or per-pupil spending) does not seem to make much difference, either. And while Mr. Murray and Mr. Herrnstein, who died recently, said that years of schooling do matter, they argued that the benefits of pushing more people through more grades would be modest.
But others plainly disagree with this rationale for laissez faire. A just-completed survey of thousands of Head Start children around the nation, by Janet Currie and Duncan Thomas of the University of California at Los Angeles and the Rand Corporation, does confirm one of the Murray-Herrnstein contentions -- that black children record substantial gains in standardized tests while they are in preschool programs but that the test scores drop after a few years.
Strikingly, though, the Currie-Thomas study's evidence on white children runs counter to the Murray-Herrnstein conclusions. Ms. Currie and Mr. Thomas found that poor whites initially gained as much from Head Start programs as blacks from comparable backgrounds did, but that the whites did not lose the edge when they began school. These white children were less likely to repeat a grade and were taller at age 9 than a sample group of youngsters who were not in Head Start, a finding that suggested that the participants were also healthier than the nonparticipants.
The most plausible explanation for the racial difference, Ms. Currie and Mr. Thomas said, is that black children in poverty live in harsher environments and thus need continued help to benefit from Head Start.
The most famous experiment in preschool enrichment -- relied on heavily by Murray-Herrnstein -- is the Perry Preschool program in the mid-1960's. About 123 black children living in poverty in Ypsilanti, Mich., with I.Q.'s below average, were divided into experimental and control groups. Those in the experimental group attended an intensive preschool progam and scored an average of 11 points higher on I.Q. tests than those in the control group. And, as Mr. Murray and Mr. Herrnstein noted in their book, the differences had faded after a few years.
That, however, is not the end of the story. Edward Gramlich, an economist at the University of Michigan who evaluated the Perry children through the age of 19, found that those in the experimental group continued to do better than those in the control group, by measures other than I.Q. These children were absent from school fewer days, less likely to be classified as retarded and more likely to graduate from high school.
What's more, as young adults, the children in the experimental group were found less likely to be on welfare or to have been arrested for a serious crime. And at the time of the survey, the young women in the experimental group had given birth to only half as many children as those in the control group. All told, Mr. Gramlich calculated that the savings to taxpayers represented by the findings far exceeded the cost of the preschool program.
There is conflicting evidence on the impact of special programs designed to enhance the performance of disadvantaged children once they are in school. A study led by the sociologist James Coleman of the University of Chicago, along with a subsequent survey of research by Eric Hanushek of the University of Rochester, disclosed no systematic relationship between student achievement and class size, teacher credentials or dollars spent.
But the preponderance of evidence suggests that intervention does work if it is planned carefully. The State of Tennessee, for example, formally experimented with class sizes in the mid-1980's to see if extra attention by teachers could raise the scores on standardized achievement tests of children living in poverty. The experimenters found that small classes offered the biggest advantage in kindergarten and perhaps first grade, and that the students in them still scored better in the second and third grade. But the gap in achievement did not widen.
Richard Murnane, a Harvard economist, and Frank Levy, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also discovered selective benefits from school enrichment. Cash with no strings attached given to elementary schools in poor neighborhoods of Austin, Tex., as part of an anti-discrimination settlement generally had no impact on test scores. When schools reorganized teaching methods, however, there were substantial dividends. "Where the money was used to change the student environment radically, scores rose sharply," Mr. Murnane reports.
By the same token, research that links years of schooling to earnings later on has been dogged by accusations that the measures it uses are spurious. Smart children from affluent backgrounds generally go to school longer and earn more as adults. But is it the years of education or the combination of heritable intelligence and family background that leads to their success?
The most sophisticated efforts to tease out cause and effect in education and earnings point in one direction. Orley Ashenfelter and Alan Krueger, economists at Princeton University, looked at the differences in earnings between identical twins. A sibling with more education earned more money -- a stunning 16 percent more a year -- for every extra year in school, they found.
David Card, another economist from Princeton, compared men who grew up near low-cost colleges with those who did not. He found that college proximity mattered a lot, raising years of schooling and average earnings. This implies that ease of access to higher education, a factor independent of intelligence or family background, helps determine earnings for adults.
Mr. Hanushek of the University of Rochester concluded, "Poor kids, dumb kids, black kids, etc., all find that their lifetime earnings are raised by added years of schooling."
Numerous questions relevant to the Herrnstein-Murray thesis remain unanswered. There is no clear evidence about which preschool, school or post-school training strategies works best to raise achievement or income. Nor is it clear that every program able to improve student performance is cost-effective: social scientists are deeply divided between those who think early intervention is essential and those who think the disadvantaged can catch up as adults.
Perhaps most important, it is far from clear that Americans are prepared to invest what is necessary to eliminate the culture of poverty if the payoff in terms of lower crime and reduce dependence on welfare takes a generation to reap. But most social scientists who have looked closely at the issues do believe that the pessimistic determinism of "The Bell Curve" is unwarranted.
"The evidence is overwhelming," says Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. "There is good reason to be optimistic that intervention can work."

HEADLINE: At Salomon, Trader Earns $30 Million

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Even though Salomon Brothers is losing more money than any other large securities firm, one of its traders is perhaps the highest paid on Wall Street.
Robert M. Stavis, a vice president in the company's New York-based bond arbitrage group, will be paid $30 million this year, according to Investment Dealer's Digest, a securities industry trade publication. 
 Mr. Stavis, who specializes in betting Salomon's capital on complex trades related to the arcane relationships between government bond prices and the fluctuation of interest rates, is one of a long line of such traders who have earned fabulously high payouts even when other parts of the industry were stumbling.
In 1990, Lawrence E. Hilibrand, who also worked in Salomon's bond arbitrage group, reportedly earned $23 million.
But Mr. Stavis will not be getting all his compensation in cash. Those earning multimillion-dollar paychecks at Salomon receive half their compensation in company stock, which they are given at a 15 percent discount to its trading price but cannot sell for five years.
Yesterday, Salomon Brothers shares closed at $38.125 each, up 62.5 cents, a 28 percent drop from their 52-week high of $52.75.
Salomon Brothers lost $547 million before taxes in the first three quarters of 1994. The so-called proprietary trading businesses, the area in which Mr. Stavis works, lost $21 million during the same period.
But Salomon compensates its executives on a 12-month period ended Sept. 30, which includes the last quarter of 1993, when the proprietary businesses earned $508 million.
Mr. Stavis and the half-dozen people who work with him in the small bond arbitrage group reportedly made a profit of $1 billion during that 12-month period.
"It seems high, but on the other hand it's possible," said a former Salomon executive familiar with Mr. Stavis who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Mr. Stavis was traveling yesterday and was unavailable for comment. Responding to inquiries, a Salomon spokesman said it was the firm's policy not to comment on employee compensation.
A 1984 graduate of the Wharton School in Philadelphia, Mr. Stavis, who is in his early 30's, has been working at Salomon for about 10 years. "He's sharp, young, curious -- a good guy," the former Salomon executive said.
But despite his salary, he hardly maintains a high profile at the firm. "I don't even know who the guy is," said a senior Salomon Brothers executive who also spoke on condition of anonymity. "Have you talked to anyone at the firm who knows anything about him?" he asked.
Mr. Stavis's outsized paycheck creates some strains for Salomon Brothers. Last month, the firm introduced a new compensation plan that would more directly link salaries and bonuses to overall performance.
Under the new plan, Mr. Stavis and Salomon's other proprietary traders will have their compensation averaged over several years, mixing the good with the bad.
"He may be the last guy to eat at the trough," the Salomon executive said.

HEADLINE: Black Investors Buy Franchises From Denny's

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
The Denny's restaurant chain, which for years has been accused of widespread prejudice against black customers, announced yesterday that a black-owned company in Atlanta had agreed to buy and operate as many as 47 Denny's restaurants in New York and New Jersey.
The arrangement moves Denny's close to meeting a goal the chain established with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to add 53 minority-owned restaurants by 1997. Only a few months ago, none of the more than 1,500 Denny's restaurants were owned by blacks. One black franchisee was added in June and a second one last week. 
 Under the new agreement, NDI Inc., which owns 23 Blockbuster video stores among other holdings, will buy 17 of the casual, sit-down restaurants this year and will have the right to acquire five more next year. At the same time, it can build 25 restaurants in New York and New Jersey over five years.
NDI said it sought the franchises based on economic opportunity, but it added that it was careful to look into the racist stigma that envelops Denny's. "You can always stand on the sidelines and say that a company is racist," said Richard Venegar of Atlanta, an NDI board member. "The best thing to do is get involved and become part of the solution. We looked into the allegations and we thought Denny's was making strides to alleviate their past."
The initial group of 17 restaurants are located in upstate New York and in south and central New Jersey. There are no Denny's restaurants in New York City. Denny's would not divulge the exact locations of the restaurants, most of which are along highways, because it said it had not yet notified their employees.
NDI said the restaurants included 10 in New York in places like Syracuse, Albany, Newburgh, Poughkeepsie and Fishkill, and 7 in New Jersey in towns like Toms River, Raritan and Eatontown.
The restaurants, NDI said, are primarily in racially mixed neighborhoods, though some are in predominantly black and some in predominantly white areas. They are now owned by the corporation, as are about two-thirds of the restaurants in the chain. Denny's would not divulge the purchase price, though NDI said it was paying about five times the cash flow.
In recent years, Denny's, owned by Flagstar Companies of Spartanburg, S.C., has been buffeted by allegations that its restaurants discriminated against black customers, turning it into a symbol of bigotry. While the company has maintained that the incidents were isolated and not part of any corporate policy, it has taken several expensive steps recently to try to shed its tarnished image.
In May, Denny's agreed to pay more than $54 million to settle lawsuits filed by thousands of black customers who contended that they had been refused service, been forced to wait longer than white patrons or been asked to pay in advance. The settlement was the largest under the Federal public-accommodations laws.
In July 1993, Flagstar, which also owns 600 Hardee's restaurants and more than 400 others carrying the names Quincy Family Steak House and El Pollo Loco, reached a "Fair Share" agreement with the N.A.A.C.P. to spend $1 billion in jobs and contracts for minorities over seven years.
The agreement requires the company to hire a significant number of black managers and subcontractors, as well as to name a black board member and increase black franchisees. It set as franchise targets 8 minority-owned restaurants by the end of 1994 and 53 by 1997.
Fred Rasheed, the national director of economic development for the N.A.A.C.P., said he was pleased with yesterday's development. "It's a significant step on their part to achieve the goals and commitments they made to us," he said.
So far as other areas of the Fair Share agreement, He said that the N.A.A.C.P. was happy with the increase in black managers at Flagstar, but he said "the jury is still out" on increasing minority purchasing contracts.
NDI is entirely black-owned and says it has revenues of about $25 million, which will double with the addition of the first 17 Denny's restaurants. Its majority investor is the Levmark Corporation, a New York black-owned investment company. Leon Wright, a 51-year-old entrepreneur, is Levmark's principal owner and founded NDI in late 1990.
James Holden, 37, joined NDI as its president and chief executive officer nine months ago, coming out of the cable service and investment banking fields. Charles Davis, who has been in the fast-food business, will serve as chief operating officer at NDI for the Denny's restaurants.
NDI said that the 17 restaurants that it is buying this year have average revenues of some $1.4 million, above the $1.2 million average for the entire chain. "They're not dogs," Mr. Venegar said.
He said the new Denny's restaurants that NDI might build were expected to include places on Long Island and, possibly, in New York City.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: MAN IN THE NEWS -- John Grosvenor Rowland;
Behind the Issues, a Yearning for Lost Innocence

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WATERBURY, Conn., Nov. 8

 BODY:
In his victory speech on primary night two months ago, John G. Rowland talked about the good old days in his hometown of Waterbury, a time not so long ago when children had the run of not just their neighborhoods, but the entire city.
In his neighborhood, he recalled, he and his friends hopped a fence so often to cut across one family's yard that the father finally did something about it: he put a gate in the fence. "Now," Mr. Rowland said, "they'd probably call the police." 
 In running for governor, Mr. Rowland campaigned against a state government that he said had grown at the expense of its constituents, overtaxing and overregulating them while failing to protect their jobs from a weak economy and their homes and families from criminals.
But beneath those issues, the 37-year-old Republican was campaigning against the loss of innocence felt by so many people since his own childhood in the 1960's. Neighborliness has diminished, fear and insecurity have grown, and to Mr. Rowland, government is to blame. Or at least, government is one problem about which something can be done.
"We're told by government every day what to do and how to do it," he told his cheering supporters that night.
"Our philosophy is sound," he said. "We want less government in our lives."
John Grosvenor Rowland was born in Waterbury on May 24, 1957, the first of five children -- four sons and a daughter. Rowlands had lived in Waterbury for generations, and they were Republicans active in the city's politics. Both his father and grandfather had served as comptroller.
Growing up in the Overlook section, a hilltop neighborhood of large stately houses, Mr. Rowland attended Holy Cross High School, where he was captain of the wrestling team and senior class president. After graduating in 1975, he attended Villanova University and earned a business degree.
Mr. Rowland's main energies at Villanova, however, were invested in his fraternity, Tau Kappa Epsilon, which elected him president, and the campus chapter of College Republicans, which he also led. "Work hard, play hard," was his motto, friends say.
He also found time to manage the primary campaign of another young Republican, Robert McMahon, challenging the party machine for a legislative seat in Pennsylvania. His candidate narrowly lost.
In 1979, Mr. Rowland came home to Waterbury to work in his family's insurance agency. The city was in economic eclipse, its brass industry wiped out by the popularity of a cheaper material, plastic, and by cheaper labor in other states. In 1980, at age 23, he ran for the State House of Representatives and was swept into office in the first Reagan landslide.
In Hartford, Mr. Rowland became a member of the Republican opposition, voting against the growing state budget and proposing a plan to change Connecticut's welfare system. In 1982, he won re-election and was appointed a House minority whip.
Economic distress made Waterbury and the Naugatuck Valley a prime territory for Reagan Democrats, and in 1984 Mr. Rowland rode the second Reagan landslide to a victory over the Democratic incumbent in the Fifth Congressional District, William Ratchford.
In Washington, Mr. Rowland, at 27, combined youth and a fraternity president's good humor with patriotic conservatism. He won a seat on the Armed Services Committee and led a task force pressing the search for soldiers missing in action in Vietnam. In 1988, he won re-election to a third term with 74 percent of the vote.
Among Connecticut Republicans, power was shifting from the old elite to a more conservative middle-class base exemplified by Mr. Rowland. When Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a liberal, lost his Senate seat in 1988, he also lost his hold over the party, and Mr. Rowland emerged as its candidate for governor in 1990.
Democrats were in disarray, but Mr. Weicker entered the race as an independent and quickly took the lead. And in a statewide campaign, Mr. Rowland's youthful conservatism hurt him for the first time. His endorsement of abortion rights, a reversal of his longstanding opposition, was attacked as insincere. He appeared alternately harsh and flippant as he vowed to end the state's fiscal crisis at the expense of state employees rather than raise taxes. Even so, he lost to Mr. Weicker by only 32,736 votes.
After 1990, Mr. Rowland founded a consulting firm and worked with some of the state's largest military contractors. He also separated from his wife, Deborah, with whom he had three children, and in 1994 was divorced.
Mr. Rowland, in interviews, has maintained that he has never had a grand plan for his political career. "When I was a state rep I never thought I would go to Congress," he said. "When I was in Congress I never anticipated running for governor."
And early this year, he announced as a candidate for governor again, saying Connecticut was worse off than in 1990. Looking to Christine Todd Whitman in New Jersey and William Weld in Massachusetts as models of fiscally conservative but socially moderate Republicans, he set restoring Connecticut's economy by cutting taxes and spending -- by getting government out of the way -- as the main issue in the campaign.
"We want to get back to the basics," Mr. Rowland would say throughout the campaign. "We want to bring back things to local control."

Economic Data Help To Lift Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
A successful start to a quarterly refinancing and two weaker-than-expected economic reports helped to lift bond prices yesterday for the first time in seven sessions.
Even gold prices rebounding from a 12-week low and a weaker dollar could not dampen the rally. Investors instead focused on the Treasury's $17 billion three-year note auction. 
 The auction drew solid demand at the average yield of 7.41 percent, up from 6.61 percent in the last auction on Aug. 9 and the highest since the auction of Nov. 6, 1990, when it was 7.78 percent. Traders expected the three-year auction to go without too much difficulty, since the yield is attractive to investors and the duration comfortably short enough.
The yield at the auction was a fair one, said Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading strategist at CS First Boston, even if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. "It was a solid day against what is still a negative longer-term outlook," Mr. Alexy said. The price of the 30-year bond rose 14/32 , to 933/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 8.12 percent, from 8.16 percent on Monday. Prices also improved on the short-maturity bills.
Investors were also encouraged by two reports yesterday. The Johnson Redbook weekly sales report was down 4 percent and weaker than expected. Some analysts say it may have served as a reminder that the economy may not be all that robust.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said stockpiles, or inventories of unsold goods, at the nation's wholesalers rose a modest four-tenths of 1 percent in September. The Government said sales declined by three-tenths of 1 percent, the first drop in five months, against a revised 3.2 percent in the prior month, up from an original 2.7 percent.
James Hale, a fixed-income analyst for MMS International, said the auction set the tone and that the Johnson Redbook report helped to ignite a small short cover rally in the market.
Typically traders try to push prices lower ahead of an auction. But yesterday, speculators betting on lower prices were forced to reverse those bets as the yield on a three-year note surged to 7.34 percent and some traders started buying the securities. Short-covering occurs when traders sell borrowed securities in the hope of buying them back at a lower price and pocketing the difference.
The Treasury will auction $12 billion in 10-year notes today and $17 billion in new one-year bills and $12 billion in 37-day cash management bills tomorrow. Late in the day, in when-issued trading, the 10-year notes were being offered at a price to yield 8.02 percent, down a basis point from the previous day. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
The market must also look ahead to a number of significant events in the next two weeks, including the release of the October report on producer prices tomorrow and a meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee on Tuesday.
"I think the elections will be overshadowed by market developments," said Mr. Hale of MMS International, noting the 10-year note auction, the reports on producer and consumer prices and the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. "It's a case of the market being oversold and due for some corrective upticks," he said.
The following are the results of yesterday's three-year Treasury note auction:

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 21.87 as Voting And Bonds Provide a Lift

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stock traders, possibly looking forward to a Republican victory in midterm Congressional elections, bid up stock prices yesterday in brisk trading.
But a small rally in the bond market, the first gains in seven sessions, probably provided the biggest lift to stocks, analysts said. And the stock market rally was limited. Barely one stock rose in price for every one stock that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. There were 1,118 advancers and 1,061 decliners. 
 Moreover, the stock rally is likely to be short-lived, even if Republicans win soundly, analysts say. With the election out of the way, traders can give full vent to their anxiety about the extent to which the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates for the sixth time this year. The Fed's policy-making committee meets next Tuesday.
"Everybody will be preoccupied -- hmmm, that's too light a word -- everyone will be obsessed with what the Fed is going to do," said Dirk van Dijk, equity strategist for C.H. Dean & Associates in Dayton, Ohio.
What's more, stock and bond traders are beginning to speculate about a bigger-than-normal Fed increase of 75 basis points, or 0.75 percent, in short-term interest rates. "The Fed debate is going to be about 50 or 75, not 25 or 50," Mr. van Dijk said.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.87 points, to 3,830.74, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 2.59 points, to 465.65. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 5.23 points, to 767.54.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was about normal, with 289.1 million shares changing hands.
Todd Clark, a senior trader at Mabon Securities in New York, said strong demand for a $17 billion auction of three-year Treasury notes helped keep interest rates moderate. But he said much of that demand was attributed to short-selling bond traders who were forced to buy to replace borrowed notes that were bought in expectation of poor demand at the auction.
"There's nothing behind this stock market" except the rise in bonds, Mr. Clark said.
Long-term interest rates, as reflected in the bond market, fell a little. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond declined to 8.12 percent from 8.16 percent.
But the dollar fell, too. The dollar dropped in New York to 97.11 yen from 97.35 yen and to 1.5092 marks from 1.5170 marks. The fate of the dollar is significant because its value will influence whether foreign investors will want to buy assets valued in dollars, like stocks and bonds.
A few stocks were up sharply. Maxxam Inc., a Houston conglomerate, rose 2 3/4, to 37 3/4, on a Wall Street Journal report that it might sell its Pacific Lumber subsidiary. Shortly before the market closed yesterday, Maxxam said it had asked Salomon Brothers to explore "business and financing alternatives" for Pacific Lumber but that "it is not pursuing" the alternatives.
UNUM, an insurance company, established a 52-week low of 39 5/8, before closing at 40 1/4, down 6 3/8. UNUM said on Monday that it would take a $10 million fourth-quarter charge for changing certain insurance policies that helped lead to a third-quarter loss.
Cincinnati Milacron, a maker of machine tools, saw its share price fall 2 1/4, to 24, after its earnings increase failed to meet analysts' expectations. Shares of America Online, a computer service for consumers, fell 6 3/4, to 66 1/4, after new reports on Microsoft's plan for a competing on-line service. Microsoft rose 1 3/4, to 63 5/8.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.99 point, to 255.28, and the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.64 point, to 451.05.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrial, 19 rose, led by Walt Disney, which gained 1 1/4, to 41. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 274 rose, led by General Electric, which increased 7/8, to 49 1/8.
The most active stock, at 4.9 million shares, was Young Broadcasting, an initial public offering and owner of television stations, which closed at 19 1/2, up 1/2 from its offering price, on its first day of trading.

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW YORK;
Generation X Makes Its Mark

BYLINE: By Michael T. Kaufman 

 BODY:
IN this season of heightened cynicism, how will today's young and relatively innocent first-time voters come to remember their political initiation?
How in years to come will they recall the time they cast their first ballot as grown men and women, as candidates who vied for their vote were mostly casting stones? 
 "Well, I can't say it's been particularly inspiring," said David Straussman, a 20-year-old aspiring actor who voted in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. "I guess I will remember that Howard Stern pulled out of the gubernatorial race. Maybe he thought politics was too sleazy."
MR. STRAUSSMAN, who said he voted because that's the way he was raised, said the campaign seemed to drag on.
"Everybody kept shouting at everybody and spending a lot of money," he said, "but I can't really say what the issues were except that everybody talked about character and integrity, which never seem to mean too much in politics.
"I thought it was great how Cuomo used the Paul Simon song with the line, 'You can call me Al,' to slag on Pataki for being D'Amato's man. Another good part was when that guy from Staten Island attacked Karen Burstein for being a lesbian and then he got denounced by his own brother, who was gay."
Mr. Straussman said he felt more of a sense of inclusion when he bought his first Lotto ticket, for the recent $72.5 million lottery drawing, than he did in voting. "I think there were more tickets sold in the lottery than there will be votes cast, and if you win in the lottery, you win much bigger than you do as a voter, and if you lose, that hurts less in the lottery than when you vote."
THEN there were Kevin Low and Allison Briseno, 18-year-old New York University freshmen who were working on their chemistry homework at Washington Square. They had registered but not yet voted.
"I have no idea when I'm going to vote," Ms. Briseno said. "I'm not really aware of what's going on. In a way it's pointless to vote because we don't think we can make a difference.
"We're a little pessimistic about politicians because we have to trust them by their words," she explained. "They say they are going to do a lot of things, but from what we've seen they really haven't done anything."
Mr. Low nodded. "We were just thinking of going out and getting a paper so we can read up on the issues," he said, at 11:30 on Election Day morning. He said he had watched the candidates' television commercials. "It seems the candidates were just trashing each other."
At a polling place in Greenwich Village, Sarah Parr, 23, said she was delighted to be voting even though the campaign seemed bad-mannered and uninformative to her. She said she could not understand why so many of her friends were not voting. "They don't care, they don't know the issues and they don't believe that voting will have any effect on them," she said.
FARTHER uptown, at the New School for Social Research, Chris Rosso, an 18-year-old psychology major, emerged from the voting booth for the first time more relieved than proud.
"I compare this campaign to a long and difficult surgical procedure with numerous arterial breaks. Something with a lot of blood and guts, but thankfully, coming to an end once it's sutured up."
Mr. Rosso, who grew up in the Bronx, said he really studied the positions of the gubernatorial candidates, an effort that left him envying the system his mother used. "So long as the candidate is Italian, she says he can't be that bad," Mr. Rosso said.
Carl Jean, a pre-med freshman at N.Y.U. whose family migrated from Haiti, said he was proud to be voting. "It's my right as a citizen," he said. "I want to be able to say I had a role in electing someone."
But he, too, admitted dismay at what he had seen and heard: "The ads no longer tell about the candidate's good qualities. It's like a game, if I can make you look bad and you look worse than me, then I win. Year after year it gets worse. I don't know where it's leading to."
IN contrast, Adina Berrios, an economics and political science student at Columbia who had been president of her high school class, was enthusiastic. "This year I was, like, 'Yes, I get to vote,' " she said as she left the polling place at 116th Street and Riverside Drive. "I feel like I've been waiting 18 years to do this. I know that statistically my vote won't make a difference, but if everyone had that attitude no one's vote would ever matter."
She added that the most disappointing part of the experience was that there were no people handing out materials. "I really wanted to get one of those 'I Voted' stickers," she said.
And so it went on another election day. Some of the young got into habits of democracy, swimming through currents of cynicism and duplicity, jumping over obstacles like fish heading upriver to spawn.
Others just sat around.

Profits from higher-rate loans to low-income home buyers.

BYLINE: By Michael Quint 

 BODY:
FOR a profitable mortgage-lending business, consumers with low incomes and checkered credit records marred by delinquent payments are not the usual prospects. But they are the bread and butter for the United Companies Financial Corporation of Baton Rouge, La., and some other finance companies, which have found that low-income homeowners will mortgage their houses at relatively high interest rates to obtain loans unavailable from other sources.
While the traditional mortgage-lending business is slumping as interest rates rise and middle-class homeowners have stopped refinancing, some lenders in low-income areas are expanding rapidly. With the help of Wall Street and bond insurance companies, these "B" and "C" loans issued to borrowers with credit blemishes are now routinely packaged into securities that can be sold readily in the financial markets. 
 That business of making high-interest-rate loans, selling them as securities and then making more loans has transformed United from a sleepy consumer loan and annuity company into a fast-growing mortgage company. United first caught the eye of analysts in mid-1993, when it sold its original bundle of mortgage securities. Since then, it has packaged $1.1 billion in mortgages and its stock has more than tripled in value.
But it still may be a good buy. After starting at less than $10 in mid-1993, United rose in over-the-counter trading to a peak of $48 in March. Affected by the general weakness in mortgage company stocks, however, it has fallen and traded at $33.50, unchanged, on Nasdaq yesterday. That is less than six times next year's expected earnings.
"This is one cheap growth stock," said Stephen Eisman, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. He noted that demand for United's loans was little affected by rising interest rates and said the company could earn $5.75 a share next year, up 26 percent from this year.
Making small mortgage loans that average about $40,000, United encourages low-income families to take out new long-term mortgages to consolidate other debts or pay for home improvements.
Borrowers, ineligible for bank loans because of their blemished credit histories, agree to interest rates that would make the typical suburban home buyer shudder. In 1993, for instance, the national averages for 15- and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were 6.08 percent and 7.02 percent, respectively. United charged an average of 11.8 percent for its 15- and 30-year loans.
United also charged fees (added to the loan amount) that averaged 7 percent of the loan, compared with the national average of 1.75 percent.
"United's customers are not people who worry about the difference between 8 percent and 8.25 percent," said Mr. Eisman of Oppenheimer. "They look to see if they can afford the monthly payment." A longer repayment schedule and the tax deduction for mortgage borrowing help make the payments lower than other consumer loans. The secret of United's success is an ability to keep losses to a minimum. While United's borrowers are more likely to be delinquent than typical mortgage customers, the company's losses have been held to under 1 percent of the loans by limiting the cash outlay to 65 percent or 70 percent of a home's estimated value.
Some critics, however, complain that the high-rate lending that United and other companies aim at low-income neighborhoods amounts to "reverse redlining."
"Our problem with these companies is not that they are not making loans," said Martin Leary, a consultant to the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union. "The problem is the terms and conditions of those loans."
The market for United's mortgages remains largely untapped and the company is growing rapidly. Using offices in 34 states and nearly 900 independent mortgage brokers, the company issued $657 million of loans in the first nine months of this year, up 83 percent from a year ago.

EQUITABLE COS. (EQ,N)

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The Equitable Companies said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings rose 25 percent, as life insurance sales continued to cushion the company from higher interest rates that hurt its brokerage business.
Equitable, the insurance and investment banking company based in New York, said net income increased to $89.3 million, or 47 cents a share, from $71.3 million, or 36 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. Revenue fell to $1.62 billion from $1.68 billion. 
 The results exceeded Wall Street's expectations of 43 cents a share, based on a survey of nine analysts by Zacks Investment Research.
In Equitable's units, earnings at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, the brokerage firm, fell 48 percent, swept along in Wall Street's worst slump since 1990. The brokerage earned $25.5 million, down from $48.7 million in the comparable quarter a year earlier.
Richard H. Jenrette, Equitable's chairman and chief executive, said continued improvement in individual life insurance and annuities sales had offset the results of "volatile financial markets."
The most recent quarter included a gain of $29 million from the sale of investments and restructuring charges of $10.1 million. The comparable quarter in 1993 included a gain from investment sales of $6.1 million and restructuring charges of $17.2 million.
Earnings at the insurance and annuity operations rose 68 percent, to $63 million, from $37.4 million in the corresponding quarter a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Medieval Marketing: A Rare-Book Copy For a Mere $16,425

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Act now while the supply lasts, and you can buy a rare facsimile of an 11th-century, illuminated German manuscript for only $16,425. After March 15, the price will rise to $19,205.
This is what S. Fischer Verlag of Frankfurt, the publisher, has told prospective German buyers interested in acquiring a 410-page, gilded copy of a pericope, a collection of richly illustrated Latin scriptural passages commissioned by Emperor Henry II of Germany in 1012 and now the property of the Bavarian State Library in Munich. 
 "It is not the most expensive book in the world," said Gabriele Shettle, a marketing assistant at the publishing house, who hopes that institutions and wealthy art lovers in Japan and America will also be undeterred.
Insel Verlag, another Frankfurt publisher, produced an edition of 1,000 copies of a 12th-century German illuminated manuscript, the Gospel of Henry the Lionhearted, five years ago and offered 950 of them at a subscription price of $19,868, which later went up to $22,517.
The unexpected financial strain of Germany's reunification in 1990, along with a recession that followed a surge in interest rates, kept them from selling like hot cakes, and a few are apparently still available.
But now, with German economic institutes and the Government confidently asserting that the recession is over, Fischer and its co-publisher, Verlag Muller & Schindler of Stuttgart, plan to bring out 500 copies of Henry II's gift to the Bamberg Cathedral, hand-lettered, gilded and richly bound for him on the island of Reichenau in the Lake of Constance.
The facsimiles, on pages measuring 12 1/2 by 16 3/4 inches, are hand-gilded with 23 1/2-carat gold and bound the way the original was, in green silk and silver and gold medallions.
The original, taken apart for the preparation of the facsimile and for later preservation and restoration, is on display in the National Museum in Munich.
"This has given the book a new lease on life," Mrs. Shettle said. The Bavarian State Library will receive a facsimile as part of the arrangement.
"We are selling this book through booksellers only, not directly to individual customers," she said. Bookstores could obtain it at a trade discount, though one considerably less than the 33 percent reduction prevailing for trade books in Germany, said Mrs. Shettle. "The price overseas booksellers choose to charge for it is beyond our control," she said.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
Rich and Poor in Cuba as Castro's Sun Sets

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Fidel Castro's condition must be verdaderamente desesperado if public television can't find a good word for him. "Last Days of the Revolution" depicts a nation in despair. The loss of Cuba's Soviet patrons, the continuance of the United States embargo and the bunglings of its Communist masters have sent the country's economy into free fall and thousands of its people on perilous voyages to Florida.
This tour by Jose de Cordoba of The Wall Street Journal was not arranged by any Cuba-United States friendship society. It finds little light on the sunny island, where blackouts can last 16 hours. Severe fuel and fertilizer shortages mean empty shelves in food stores. Medicines, too, are in short supply. The young have little hope of good jobs, and some former Fidelistas declare their loss of faith. 
 The Government's need for hard currency has brought back some of the ills the Cuban revolution was supposed to cure: the camera finds rich foreigners living it up, with the cooperation of prostitutes, while citizens suffer. Many people scrape by with the help of money orders from relatives in the United States.
The question for Washington is whether to maintain the embargo in hopes of forcing Castro to quit or at least stop jailing dissenters, or to relax the embargo to ease life for suffering Cubans and reopen a nearby market to American businesses. United States policy, Mr. De Cordoba notes, is constrained by the fierce anti-Castro sentiment of the Cuban exile community in southern Florida.
As the film crew departs the unlucky island, the longest-lived Communist dictator gives no signs of making political reforms, much less going quietly into the political night. The one-time glamour boy of the left is last seen clinging to a bankrupt ideology in a bankrupt country.
 
'The American Experience'
'The Battle of the Bulge'
PBS, tonight at 8:30
(Channel 13 in New York)
In December 1944, the Allied troops rolling victoriously toward Germany were stopped short and hard by a quarter of a million German soldiers. The surprise counterattack sent the Allies reeling back 50 miles; 16,000 Americans, mostly infantrymen, died and tens of thousands were wounded or taken prisoner. A stunned American general is quoted on tonight's 90-minute account of that military disaster: "I've lost a division faster than any other commander in the U.S. Army."
Making grimly effective use of newsreels and Army photographs, "The Battle of the Bulge" relays the experiences of a dozen American soldiers, from a colonel to several privates, who found themselves outnumbered by a better-equipped force in freezing temperatures. Lacking air support because of overcast skies, for about a week the Americans became part of a bitter retreat. One says, "Both the enemy and the weather could kill you."
After the skies cleared, it took two arduous weeks more to regain the ground lost, that famous bulge. Recalling the ill-trained, ill-conditioned young men who were rushed to the front to help push back the Germans, an officer says, "Sergeants never even got to know their names before they were wounded or killed the next day."
In June, television was filled with commemorations of D-Day, another costly battle, which offered the consolation of beginning the liberation of Europe. The Battle of the Bulge, of course, also ended in victory, but the failure of Allied intelligence that put so many Americans at the mercy of the enemy and the elements left these survivors only with memories of pain and loss.

HEADLINE: Republican Gains and Obligations

 BODY:
"I need help, folks," said President Clinton during his final, desperate burst of campaigning. He did not get it. The result was a historic shift of power to the Republicans, in Washington and in statehouses throughout the nation.
The consequences of the weak Democratic showing were particularly painful in New York State. It lost a Governor of great stature, Mario Cuomo, in favor of an untested newcomer, George Pataki. Mr. Pataki's promise of a sweeping tax cut poses a clear threat to New York City. Its Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, responded heroically to this threat with his endorsement of Mr. Cuomo. The first test for Mr. Pataki will be to show that he is not vindictive toward the city or the Mayor, and that he is independent of his political sponsor, Senator Alfonse D'Amato. 
 The task for Mr. Clinton is more formidable. With Republicans winning control of both the Senate and the House, he must now articulate a legislative program that stands some chance of success despite a far weaker hand. There were a few bright spots -- Oliver North's defeat in Virginia among them -- but over all this was a powerful body blow to Bill Clinton and a repudiation of his party's conduct in Congress.
Mr. Clinton is not wholly to blame. His advisers fear that the losing Democrats will fault him for their individual misfortunes and that the survivors will decide they owe him nothing. But the reasons for the Democratic debacle go beyond the President and predate his tenure. When Mr. Clinton came to town the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, and the Congressional leadership could not deliver on the agenda defined by him and endorsed by their convention and their Congressional candidates.
This failure of governance must be laid at the feet of the retiring Senate majority leader, George Mitchell; the embattled Speaker, Thomas Foley, and a leadership team that placed loyalty to them above cooperation with the White House or public demands for Congressional and campaign finance reform. Add this non-performance to the familiar witches' brew of public discontent -- the sour national attitude toward politics generally and the rebellion against incumbents in particular -- and it is easy to see why the Democrats got whacked.
There is at least one other major cause: a nagging, nationwide sense of economic discomfort. On its face this is puzzling. The economy has improved, inflation is low and the deficit is under better control than it was during the 12 Reagan-Bush years.
But to millions of people this is vague and theoretical stuff. They do not feel better in their pocketbooks. Meanwhile, the party that promised welfare reform produced none; the party that made a huge bet on health-care reform used a secret laboratory to create a Frankenstein's monster that defied legislative redesign. The fact that there was a crime bill, a North American Free Trade Agreement and some smaller trophies did not, in the end, count for much with the public.
In a CBS News/New York Times Poll a couple of weeks ago, only 30 percent said that "government should do more to solve national problems" while 63 percent said government was doing "too many things better left to businesses and individuals." That is one big problem for a President who still sees himself as an activist. His other big problem is all those feisty Republicans who will be parachuting into Washington come January.
These Republicans do not much believe in government and they are not likely to be helpful. Many of them ran and won on Newt Gingrich's seductive but simplistic "Contract With America." Some of them ran on demagogic symbols -- the death penalty, immigrant-bashing.
Whatever they ran on, all of them ran against Bill Clinton. This is not a happy prospect for a man who campaigned in 1992 on one theme: change. But as Senator Phil Gramm suggested, the new force in Congress cannot expect to sell two-party gridlock as the solution to the one-party version that the voters rejected so powerfully yesterday. "Now the burden is on Republicans," Senator Gramm observed. "Can we give them a coherent program?"

HEADLINE: Let's Not Rush Into World Trade Agreement

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In early December the House and Senate return to vote on implementing the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, which was negotiated with more than 100 other countries over a period of several years. Sadly, press coverage has been thin and not very substantial. 
 In the last two and a half years, I've taught the Dunkel draft/Uruguay Round text three times in my international trade and finance classes. I've become well acquainted with grave GATT shortcomings.
Unfortunately, most public debate focuses on shallow labels (like free trade versus protection) rather than substance. Neglected are:
* The World Trade Organization's unbalanced voting regime (like the United Nations General Assembly).
* The great weakening of United States trade law remedies.
* Inadequate discipline over foreign subsidies in agriculture, manufacturing and services.
* Emasculation of United States safeguard relief.
* Weak and dubious language supposedly giving the United States protection for service and intellectual property interests abroad.
* A dispute settlement regime that forces binding arbitration on United States interests in agriculture, the environment, manufacturing, services and intellectual property.
* Overall entrenchment of unequal trade openness that hurts United States working people, causing a net loss of American jobs.
Why did United States trade negotiators accept such a deal? They promised in the spring of 1993 to sign a draft agreement on Dec. 15, 1993, no matter what. Not surprisingly, the United States lost out.
The Administration felt its prestige was on the line. The 1994 world trade agreement then became a symbol of President Clinton's accomplishments, and a political football, with hardly any attention to its 450 pages of highly technical language. Few commentators show a grasp of these details.
But there is some good news in all this. Because of partisan wrangling and sneaky inserts in the implementation bills, Congress wisely put the vote on GATT off until after the elections.
Now Congress should delay any implementation until full and detailed hearings are held in the next Congress in 1995. The fall election pressure over political symbols is over, and Congress has a duty to the public to give the trade agreement a careful, probing examination.
Finally, we should realize that a more open (though unequal and unbalanced) global economy and trade regime is well established and secure. The United States economy is the most open in the world. That's part of the problem! The United States needs a more level playing field in global trade. GATT 1994 fails this test. It only entrenches unequal trade openness and makes it much harder to open foreign markets.
That's why Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, has achieved virtually nothing in trade negotiations with Japan. GATT 1994, signed in Marrakesh, Morocco, in April, greatly erodes our leverage and ability to restrict American imports in response to foreign subsidies and trade practices.
These remarks are not intended to be partisan. Democrats, moderates and Republicans and, most important, the bulk of the American people will benefit greatly if we slow down, re-examine and substantially improve the GATT deal.
There's no rush. The Uruguay Round has already taken 12 years from early gestation efforts in 1982. But let's get it right, and not gravely damage United States interests in agriculture, the environment, manufacturing, services and overall employment.

Northeast

 BODY:

CONNECTICUT
Joseph I. Lieberman, one of only a half-dozen Senate Democrats with seemingly secure seats, trounced his challenger, Gerald Labriola, a retired pediatrician and former State Senator who made little headway against the popular incumbent. Mr. Labriola had promised to serve only one term if he won.
With the retirement of Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the race for governor was a muddled four-way contest won by John G. Rowland, a former Republican Representative. His opponents were William E. Curry Jr., a Democrat who is the state comptroller; Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark of Mr. Weicker's A Connecticut Party, and an anti-tax crusader, Tom Scott, running as the long-shot Independence Party candidate. Mr. Rowland overcame a late setback when it was disclosed that he had tried to suppress a police report about a marital dispute. 
In a notable House race, Representative Gary Franks, who in 1990, became the first black Republican with voting status in the House since 1935, held on to defeat James H. Maloney, a State Senator.

DELAWARE
William V. Roth Jr., a genial Reagan-era tax-cutter seeking a fifth Senate term, turned back a challenge from Charles M. Oberly 3d, the state's 47-year-old Democratic Attorney General.
Mr. Oberly, who is a proven statewide vote-getter for the Democrats, faded in the polls despite strong anti-crime credentials and the fact that Mr. Roth, 73, who campaigns with a trademark St. Bernard, has been precluded from running on the Republican platform for change. Mr. Roth was seen as vulnerable enough that Representative Michael N. Castle, a former Governor, considered a challenge in the primary.
Mr. Castle was likely to retain the state's sole House seat by dispatching Carol Ann DeSantis, a hospital executive.
 
Senate, 93% reporting
Oberly, 78,928, 42%
Roth, 104,659, 56%
 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
Redemption was the campaign theme of former Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., who struggled back from a 1990 drug conviction and six-month jail term. Carol Schwartz, a Republican who also lost to Mr. Barry in 1986, conceded shortly before midnight after staying even in early ballot returns.
Ms. Schwartz blamed Mr. Barry for the city's chronic budget deficits, dilapidated public schools and steady loss of jobs and residents to the suburbs. She advocated the sale of city land and tough tax collection. Mr. Barry stressed his 30 years of experience in public life, calling for a spirit of healing to address the city's crime and drug problems.
 
MAYOR, 57% reporting
Barry, 58,391, 53%
Schwartz, 50,426, 46%
 
MAINE
It was supposed to be a relatively calm political year in this state, but Senator George J. Mitchell's plan to retire set off a ripple effect from the state's highest office to the lowest.
Both United States Representatives -- Thomas H. Andrews, a Democrat, and Olympia J. Snowe, a Republican -- gave up their House seats to run for Mr. Mitchell's seat. Ms. Snowe won easily.
Early on, Mr. Andrews seemed well positioned to keep the Senate seat in Democratic hands. Some of Mr. Mitchell's popularity seemed to rub off on the 41-year-old liberal Congressman, who was elected twice to the House with large majorities. And President Clinton is highly regarded here.
The fiercely independent character of the state seems to have been a factor.
Ms. Snowe's moderate Republican views attracted many supporters of Ross Perot, who won 30 percent of the vote in the 1992 Presidential election.
Mr. Andrews also had a hard time selling his liberal views to Republicans.
Before Mr. Mitchell's announcement, most attention was on the governor's race, which was a tight one between Joseph Brennan, a Democrat who was Governor from 1979 to 1987, and Angus King, a businessman who is running as an independent. But Mr. Brennan could be hurt by the independent streak of voters. Susan M. Collins, a Republican, was not expected to pose a challenge.
 
SENATE, 24% reporting
Andrews, 37,339, 37%
Snowe, 58,959, 59%
 
MARYLAND
For weeks it looked as if Parris N. Glendening, a three-term Prince George's County executive, would easily succeed his fellow Democrat, Gov. William Donald Schaefer, who was barred by law from a third term. That changed after Ellen R. Sauerbrey, the Republican leader of the Maryland House, pulled a stunning upset in a primary against Representative Helen Delich Bentley.
Patterning her campaign after that of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, Ms. Sauerbrey pledged to cut income taxes 25 percent. Last night, it appeared the race might be decided by absentee ballots.
With one of the lower profiles in the Senate, Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, the Democratic incumbent, looked vulnerable to some political experts early in the campaign. But he easily fended off a challenge from William E. Brock 3d, a former Republican Senator from Tennessee and a former head of the Republican National Committee.
Two factors combined to help Mr. Sarbanes retain the seat that he first won in 1976. Democrats hold a 2-to-1 advantage in voter registration, and Mr. Sarbanes attacked Mr. Brock as a carpetbagger.
 
 SENATE, 100% reporting
 Sarbanes, 788,032, 59%
 Brock, 538,351, 41%

 Sauerbrey, 677,804, 50%
 
MASSACHUSETTS
In the toughest election of his 32-year political career, Senator Edward M. Kennedy defeated his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, after a hard-fought final month of campaigning.
Mr. Romney, a venture capitalist, had been even with Senator Kennedy in polls in September, but in the campaign's final weeks, Mr. Romney's performances in two debates failed to generate heat. He tried to regain the initiative with half-hour commercials in the style of Ross Perot.
Mr. Romney, the son of former Gov. George Romney of Michigan, was credited with a polished campaign style in this, his first, race. His negative advertisements painted Senator Kennedy as obsolete and tired, including one commercial that showed the Senator having difficulty sitting. But Mr. Romney was largely successful only in casting himself as an alternative to his veteran opponent, whose checkered personal life hurt his popularity.
Mr. Kennedy, who has won six times with at least 55 percent of the vote, was an uncomfortable campaigner. But he put up a strong defense in the last month, characterizing Mr. Romney as a businessman who "puts profits over people." .
In the race for the governorship, William F. Weld, a Republican, handily won re-election against State Representative Mark R. Roosevelt.
 
 SENATE, 35% reporting
 Kennedy, 409,729, 58%

NEW HAMPSHIRE
Ever since Representative Dick Swett, a Democrat, broke the 76-year Republican hold on the state's Second District House seat in 1990, he has been a target for overthrow.
And in a race dominated by hard-hitting advertising, Mr. Swett's Republican challenger, former State Senator Charles F. Bass, appeared likely to reclaim the seat for his party. Mr. Bass criticized his opponent's ties to President Clinton and relied on his mainstream record to court swing voters.
This year's curse of incumbency notwithstanding, other officeholders appeared safe. Gov. Steve Merrill, a Republican, defeated Wayne D. King, a State Senator, by a wide margin. And a two-term Republican Representative, Bill Zeliff, cruised to victory over his challenger, Bill Verge.
 
 GOVERNOR, 78% reporting
 King, 58,654, 25%
 Merrill, 161,439, 70%
 
NEW JERSEY
With 89 percent of the votes counted, Chuck Haytaian, the Republican State Assembly Speaker, did better than expected against Senator Frank R. Lautenberg. But the incumbent still won a third term from New Jersey's notoriously volatile electorate.
Last spring, Republicans eyeing control of the Senate had cited Mr. Lautenberg's seat as vulnerable. But Mr. Haytaian was at a disadvantage, having raised $3 million less than the incumbent's $7.4 million, in a state where television advertisements must be bought in both the costly New York and Philadelphia markets.
Mr. Haytaian, a strict conservative, campaigned on a flat Federal income tax and sought to ride the coattails of the popular Governor, Christine Todd Whitman, who appeared with him often on the stump. Mr. Lautenberg was also endorsed by Ross Perot.
In the House races, Republicans were expected to fill two open seats. In one, Frank A. Lobiondo, a State Assemblyman, should succeed Representative William J. Hughes, a Democrat who is retiring after 10 terms.
The Republicans may gain another seat in the state's closest Congressional race, in which Herb Klein, a freshman Representative is running against William Martini, a lawyer and former Assistant United States Attorney.
 
Senate, 89% reporting
Haytaian, 833,666, 47%
Lautenberg, 896,795, 51%
 
NEW YORK
New York voters declared it was gold-watch time for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, one of the nation's most unabashed liberals. Another well-known liberal, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, was on the ballot this year, but most people in the country may not have even been aware Senator Moynihan was up for re-election because he never faced any real threat from the Republican, Bernadette Castro, the convertible sofa heiress.
Not so Governor Cuomo, whose chances to win a fourth term always seemed at risk during the campaign, and the reasons had little to do with his Republican opponent, George F. Pataki, a state legislator and former Mayor of Peekskill. Mr. Cuomo's vulnerabilities were a combination of the same troubles that have bedeviled other incumbents, especially Democrats, this year as well as a kind of voter fatigue with the intense Governor himself.
In the final weeks, Mr. Cuomo fought back, one of his principal weapons being the endorsement of New York's Republican Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Guiliani said he crossed party lines because Mr. Cuomo would help New York while Mr. Pataki's policies would make it harder to run the city. But the Mayor now has to live with his decision as Mr. Pataki will occupy the Governor's mansion in Albany.
 
SENATE, 95% reporting
 Castro, 1,815,894, 41%
 Moynihan, 2,426,597, 55%
 GOVERNOR, 93% reporting
 Cuomo, 2,122,514, 45%
 Golisano, 190,646, 4%
 Pataki, 2,304,461, 49%
 
PENNSYLVANIA
Senator Harris Wofford, a Democrat who won his seat in a special election three years ago largely on a platform of overhauling the nation's health care system, was in a tight race with Representative Rick Santorum. Less than two weeks ago, Mr. Wofford had been trailing. But he fought back with television commercials accusing Mr. Santorum of favoring a delay in Social Security benefits until recipients reached the age of 70.
That was not the only hotly contested race in Pennsylvania. The decision by the popular Governor, Robert P. Casey, to step down generated a heated race between Lieut. Gov. Mark S. Singel, a Democrat, Representative Tom Ridge, a Republican, and Peg Luksik, an abortion opponent who ran as an independent. Mr. Ridge won that race. Mr. Singel had problems: with reports that as head of the State Board of Pardons, he recommended parole for a prisoner who is now charged with rape and murder in New York City.
 
Senate, 97% reporting
Santorum, 1,666,868, 49%
Wofford, 1,591,663, 47%
Governor, 95% reporting
Luksik, 426,778, 13%
Ridge, 1,500,547, 45%
Singel, 1,339,272, 40%
 
RHODE ISLAND
Lincoln C. Almond, a Republican and former United States Attorney, was in a dead heat with State Representative Myrth York in the race for governor, according to early results. It is a race that will be remembered for primaries in which the Democratic incumbent was denied renomination by his party and the Republican front-runner lost by a wide margin.
Ms. York got twice as many votes in the September primary as Gov. Bruce Sundlun, whose administration was plagued by ethical and fiscal problems. But despite the state's Democratic tilt and early polls indicating a tight race, Ms. York fell behind Mr. Almond, a no-nonsense, take-charge campaigner who did well with voters anxious about crime and the economy.
Senator John H. Chafee, a moderate Republican seeking his fourth term, defeated State Representative Linda J. Kushner.
But a Democrat, Patrick J. Kennedy, was favored for the seat vacated by Ronald K. Machtley, who lost the Republican nomination for governor to Mr. Almond in the primaries. Mr. Kennedy, the 27-year-old son of Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, campaigned as the candidate best suited to bring Federal programs and money to the state.
 
SENATE, 99% reporting
Chafee, 212,747, 64%
Kushner, 117,403, 36%
GOVERNOR, 99% reporting
Almond, 164,041, 47%
York, 151,750, 44%
 
VERMONT
Although Vermont is noted for upsets in non-Presidential years, Senator James M. Jeffords, an independent-minded and well-financed Republican, won a second term despite a late spurt by Jan Backus, a Democratic State Senator, who ran as an ordinary "mom". An endorsement on Friday from the state's biggest paper, The Burlington Free-Press, did not help Ms. Backus much.
But the Democrats did hold onto the governorship, as the popular incumbent, Dr. Howar Dean, won a second term. Dr. Dean, a physician, was ineffectively challenged by two opponents who split the meager anti-Dean vote.
Probably the most interesting race was for Vermont's lone House seat held by Bernard Sanders, the former Burlington Mayor who runs as an independent but calls himself a socialist. He put himself at risk by angering gun control opponents with his vote for the crime bill and its ban on assault weapons. In 1990, Mr. Sanders won his seat when gun owners aggressively opposed his Republican opponent. This time, the Republicans have put up John Carroll, majority leader of the Vermont Senate. No Democrat is on the ballot.
 
WEST VIRGINIA
Anti-incumbent sentiment has been weak in West Virginia, one state where voters still appreciate Federal spending. Robert C. Byrd, the six-term Democratic Senator, is known in his home state as a coal field orphan who put himself through law school at night and has never forgotten his roots. As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee since 1989, he has directed at least $1.5 billion to his home state, much of it for roads to connect the hills and hollows of this Appalachian state.
West Virginia voters responded today by choosing him over Stan Klos, a wealthy Republican real estate developer who did not campaign actively.

ILLINOIS
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the 18-term Chicago Democrat who stepped down as the head of the Ways and Means Committee after his indictment earlier this year on corruption charges, lost to a relative unknown, Michael P. Flanagan. Mr. Rostenkowski had run a low-profile campaign and, sensing his vulnerability, the national Republican Party last week sent his campaign more than $50,000 for an advertising blitz.
Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican in his first term, trounced the state's comptroller, Dawn Clark Netsch, whose campaign never got off the ground after she staged an upset victory in the primary last spring. 
 One other House contest offered a strong chance for changing from Democrat to Republican hands. Polls showed the seat in Joliet held by Representative George E. Sanmeister, a Democrat who is retiring, as likely to be won by State Representative Gerald C. Weller, a Republican.
In Peoria, the seat opening up with the retirement of Robert H. Michel, the House minority leader, was captured by his former chief of staff, Ray LaHood, who was facing a contest against Mr. Michel's old opponent, G. Douglas Stephens.

INDIANA
Senator Richard G. Lugar swept to victory with more than twice as many votes as his Democratic opponent, former Representative Jim Jontz. Mr. Jontz tried to prod anti-incumbent sentiment with advertisements in which he visited Indiana towns with names like Moscow, Peru and Lebanon looking for the foreign aid that Senator Lugar voted for in 18 years in office, but he could not dent the Senator's popularity.
David McIntosh, a Republican who was once on Dan Quayle's staff, won Muncie's Second District, opened by the retirement of Representative Phil Sharp, a Democrat.In the Fifth DistrictRepresentative Steve Buyer, a freshman Republican, fended off a challenge from John D. Beatty.

IOWA
Gov. Terry E. Branstad, a Republican, was considered vulnerable in his unprecedented bid for a fourth term, having only narrowly survived a bruising primary challenge from Representative Fred Grandy, a more moderate Republican. Mr. Grandy, who was an actor on the "Love Boat" television series, refused to endorse Gov. Branstad, and Mr. Grandy's wife was an outspoken supporter of the Governor's opponent, Attorney General Bonnie Campbell.
The election left Iowa with an all-Republican Congressional delegation. The only Democratic House incumbent, Neal Smith, lost his seat to Greg Ganske. Representative Jim Ross Lighfoot, Jime Leach and Jim Nussle all fended off Democratic challengers. An Mr. Grandy's district went to the Republican candidate, Tom Latham, whose opponent was Sheila McGuire.

Branstad, 514,128, 57%

KANSAS
With no Senate seats at stake, the main interest in this Republican state is the gamble by Jim Slattery, a six-term Democrat who is the only member of his party this year to give up a House seat to run for governor. But Mr. Slattery has failed to find significant issues to distinguish himself from his friend and Republican opponent, Bill Graves, the Kansas Secretary of State for eight years. Mr. Slattery trailed in his effort to hold one of the Democrats' most vulnerable governorships.
The was open because Joan Finney, a 41-year veteran of Kansas politics who is an advocate of term limits, was retiring.
The hottest House race was the one to succeed Mr. Slattery in his Topeka-based district. This, too, tilted Republican, although the party's candidate, Sam Brownback, a former state agriculture secretary, failed to pull away decisively from former Gov. John Carlin, whose extensive political baggage included higher taxes.
 
GOVERNOR, 58% reporting
Graves, 309,613, 63%

MICHIGAN
Michigan was one state that switched from the Democratic to the Republican column when Spencer Abraham, the former state Republican chairman and aide to Dan Quayle, defeated Representative Bob Carr in the Senate race for the seat that had been held by retiring Senator Donald W. Riegle.
Mr. Carr had been counting heavily on support from organized labor, but it was insufficient because Mr. Abraham was able to ride on the coattails of John Engler, the Republican Governor.
Earlier this year, Mr. Engler won a huge victory in a referendum to reduce property taxes and change the way public education was financed. With the economy on the rebound, Mr. Engler was able to defeat handily former Representative Howard Wolpe, whose campaign was less than adept.
Democrats managed to fend off serious challenges for most Congressional seats they had held.

MINNESOTA
In a year when Democrats were struggling to hold onto the Senate, Ann Wynia was the only one of 13 Democrats running for Republican-held seats who seemed to have a real chance of winning.
But she lost to her Republican rival, Representative Rod Grams. The choice could not have been clearer.
Ms. Wynia, the 51-year-old former majority leader in the State House, has stressed the need for a greater government role in issues involving women and children.
But Mr. Grams, a 46-year-old House freshman with a voting record as conservative as any in the House, campaigned on a platform calling for a smaller Government that is tougher on crime.
The importance of the race was underscored by the fact that both President Clinton and Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, made campaign stops in the state.
Experts said the outcome of the race could depend on whether religious conservatives and other conservative Republicans -- the voters Mr. Grams is counting on -- turn out to vote in large numbers.
Gov. Arne Carlson, a Republican moderate, won in a landslide over State Senator John Marty, who has changed campaign managers three times.

Representative Alan Wheat, the first black to be nominated for statewide office in Missouri, lost his bid for a United States Senate seat to John Ashcroft, a Republican and former Governor. The seat was held by John C. Danforth, who is retiring.
Mr. Wheat, a six-term Democratic Congressman, was hampered by the battering he took in the primary, in which he depleted his campaign treasury and was attacked for his use of Congressional perks and his 86 overdrafts at the House bank.
Mr. Ashcroft had virtually no opposition in the Republican primary.
A Republican also posed a strong challenge to the incumbent Democrat in the Congressional district that includes Columbia. Representative Harold L. Volkmer, who had won his primary with 57 percent of the vote against five challengers, was in a tight race with Kenny Hulshof, a Republican state prosecutor who had attacked Mr. Volkmer as a liberal spender and a supporter of big government.
The only serious challenge to a Republican-held Congressional seat was in southwestern Missouri, where Representative Mel Hancock was criticized as too conservative. The Democratic nominee, James R. Fossard, a lawyer from Springfield, ran on a moderate-to-conservative platform, favoring abortion rights while backing capital punishment.

NEBRASKA
Senator Bob Kerrey's well-publicized attacks on President Clinton's leadership helped him shield himself from the Republican challenger, Jan Stoney, a former top executive at US West.
The Senate campaign overshadowed the race of Gov. Ben Nelson, a 53-year-old Democrat, who trounced Gene Spence, 60-year-old director of Omaha Public Power.
Not all Democrats were getting off lightly. Representative Peter Hoagland, 52, faced an attack by a 31-year-old Republican insurance executive, Jon Christensen.
Nebraskans appeared likely to approve a term-limit initiative.

NORTH DAKOTA
Senator Kent Conrad, a freshman Democrat, defeated Ben J. Clayburgh, an orthopedic surgeon. Coming from a state that handed three electoral votes to President Bush, Mr. Conrad was one of the Democrats in the West who campaigned by distancing himself from Mr. Clinton. But his advertisements were unusual for the pains they took to keep away from the White House. They noted that Mr. Conrad had voted with Bob Dole, the Republican Senate leader, more than half the time.
In the contest for the state's sole House seat, the Democratic incumbent, Earl Pomeroy, was the favorite against State Representative Gary Porter.
 
OHIO
Two wealthy men tried to present themselves as ordinary citizens as they pursued a Senate seat in this heavily blue-collar state. Joel Hyatt, the Democratic son-in-law of Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, a Democrat whose retirement left the seat up for grabs, made a fortune from his legal services company and had appeared in its television advertisements for years. But low public esteem for lawyers caught up with him in the campaign, as many people told pollsters that they personally disliked him.
Voters chose instead the Republican candidate, Lieut. Gov. Mike DeWine, the scion of a family that made its money in seeds. He wore plaid shirts and took a down-home tone in building solid support in heavily Republican rural areas.
Joseph Slovenec, an anti-abortion campaigner, made a strong showing for a candidate from outside the two major parties.
Gov. George V. Voinovich, a Republican and former Mayor of Cleveland, easily won re-election over Robert Burch, a Democratic State Senator.

SOUTH DAKOTA
It was something of an upset when William Janklow defeated Gov. Walter D. Miller in the Republican primary. But Mr. Janklow was not an unknown. He had been Governor for two terms, but state law bars a third consecutive term.
Mr. Janklow defeated his Democratic opponent, Jim Beddow, the former president of Dakota Wesleyan University, who hoped voters would want a a fresh face.
But Mr. Janklow had made an issue of two ballot initiatives -- one to cut property taxes and the other on the fate of the state's video lottery -- arguing that an experienced leader could handle the fiscal crisis that could result from their passage.
Representative Tim Johnson, a Democrat, won a fifth term.

WISCONSIN
The nation's anti-incumbency epidemic spared Wisconsin. Senator Herb Kohl, a centrist Democrat, kept his seat, shrugging off a challenge from Robert T. Welch, a conservative Republican. Senator Kohl, who owns the Milwaukee Bucks baseball team and many commercial properties, spent millions of dollars of his own money to win the seat in 1988, and millions more this time around.
And Gov. Tommy G. Thompson won a third term, pulling more than twice as many votes as his Democratic opponent, State Senator, Charles J. Chvala. Gov. Thompson has remained a voter favorite in part because of his tough stance on welfare -- the state's welfare rolls have shrunk by 23 percent during his tenure -- and Mr. Chvala aroused little voter interest with his
charge that Gov. Thompson was mean-spirited, pointing out that child poverty rose as the welfare rolls shrank.

 BODY:

ALASKA
A Democrat, Tony Knowles, went into Election Day with a big lead in the polls in his bid for re-election as Governor despite an acerbic campaign run by his Republican opponent, Jim Campbell, a retired Anchorage businessman.
One advertisement, which the Campbell campaign ran briefly in October, created a flurry of concern among Mr. Knowles's supporters, who complained that it wrongly accused him of womanizing. 
 In the commercial, a male radio announcer says, "President Clinton is tall, has a shy smile, good hair," then adds: "Some women tell me he's really good-looking. And then I noticed Tony Knowles -- tall, shy smile, good hair -- same thing with the women."
Lieut. Gov. Jack Coghill was running as the Alaska Party Choice in the race.
The incumbent for Alaska's only House seat, Don Young, a Republican, was also favored to win re-election. Mr. Young narrowly won in 1990 and 1992.
For the fourth time in two decades, a measure was on the ballot to move the state capital from Juneau, a waterfront city of 26,000 people, to Wasilla, a frontier-like town of 4,000 people. The effort has failed in the past because of concern about the cost of moving.
 
ARIZONA
Democrats were hoping their designs on Arizona, long a conservative bastion, would be realized in the strong race for governor mounted by Eddie Basha, a supermarket magnate, against the Republican incumbent, J. Fife Symington.
But in a close race Mr. Basha lost to Governor Symington, who used his opponent's support for homosexual marriages to undercut his opponent's popularity among conservative Democrats.
In a pivotal race for the Senate seat held by Dennis DeConcini, a Democrat who is retiring, Republicans were poised to gain a seat. In early returns, Representative Sam Coppersmith, a freshman Democrat, trailed Representative John Kyl, who had a solid head start when he breezed through the Republican primary with no opposition. Mr. Coopersmith trailed throughout the campaign.
Republicans also picking up three House seats, including the one Mr. Coppersmith vacated and one in the Sixth District, where Representative Karan English, a Democrat, struggled against a challenge by J. D. Hayworth, a first-time candidate who is a former sportscaster.

CALIFORNIA
The Senate race in California captured the nasty air of the 1994 campaign. By Election Day, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Democrat, was calling her opponent a carpetbagger and a hypocrite, and the Republican, Representative Michael Huffington, was calling her a liar and a disgrace to the state.
A transplanted Texan with an oil fortune, Mr. Huffington broke all records for spending in a Senate race, dipping into his own pocket for $28 million, two times Ms. Feinstein's war chest, for what was largely a battle of the airwaves.
Mr. Huffington's surging campaign sputtered badly in the last two weeks, after disclosures that he and his wife, Arianna, had hired an illegal alien. Reports last week said that Ms. Feinstein had a similar problem, but she said that the immigrant, a Guatemalan, had documents that showed that she was in the United States legally, although after a bit of confusion the Immigration and Naturalization Service said her status was illegal. By early this morning, the race was too close to call.
Almost overshadowed by the invective, Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, rebounded from the lowest approval ratings in state history to win a second term over Kathleen Brown, daughter of a former governor, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, and sister of another, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. Once more than 20 points behind, Mr. Wilson, 61, attacked illegal immigration and accused Ms. Brown, 49, of being soft on crime.
The national Republican tsunami also carried the entertainer Sonny Bono into a Congressional seat.
Long the wellspring of controversial ballot measures, California is at it again this year with Proposition 187, which would bar illegal aliens from welfare, education and nonemergency health services.
Californians were apparently dismissing challenges to the measure, and seemed poised to approve it.
Californians also appeared to be voting down two initiatives: one to create a single-payer health care system, and another, heavily backed by the tobacco industry, to replace local anti-smoking laws with statewide standards that would in some cases be looser.

COLORADO
Gov. Roy Romer won a third term despite deep voter displeasure with incumbent Democrats in general and Mr. Romer's close ties to President Clinton, who is unpopular in Colorado.
Mr. Romer's victory may have owed less to the state's economic growth than to the self-destruction of his challenger, Bruce Benson, a millionaire oilman and a former state Republican chairman. What had been a dead heat until last month turned against Mr. Benson after a series of embarrassing disclosures about him. Voters also disdained his decision to cancel eight debates with Mr. Romer, who Mr. Benson said was a better debater.
No upsets were expected in Congressional races.
Also on the ballot was an initiative to raise tobacco taxes to increase health care to the poor. Another initiative would give towns and cities more power to outlaw sexually explicit books, magazines and videos.
 
 GOVERNOR, 8% reporting
 Benson, 54,727, 38%
 Romer, 82,163, 57%
 
HAWAII
For much of the year, Patricia F. Saiki, a former Republican Representative, seemed poised to become the state's first female governor and its first Republican leader since 1959. A decline in tourism as well as rising living costs and welfare rolls threatened the Democrats' grip on the office.
But Lieut. Gov. Ben Cayetano, a Democrat, recently gained momentum and was expected to succeed Gov. John Waihee 3d, who could not run for a third consecutive term.
The challenge of a popular independent, Frank Fasi, a former mayor of Honolulu, siphoned votes from both parties.
Senator Daniel K. Akaka, the incumbent Democrat, seemed headed toward an easy victory.
Despite an aggressive challenge by Orson Swindle, a Republican who advised Ross Perot in 1992, Representative Neil Abercrombie, the two-term incumbent, had a comfortable lead with 60 percent of the votes counted.
 
SENATE, 67% reporting
Akaka, 171,933, 73%
Hustace, 55,255, 23%
GOVERNOR, 69% reporting
Cayetano, 94,534, 39%
Fasi, 70,952, 29%
Saiki, 71,978, 29%
 
IDAHO
With the retirement of Gov. Cecil D. Andrus, a Democrat, voters saw a tight race between Attorney General Larry EchoHawk, a Democrat who sought to become the first Indian governor in the nation, and his Republican challenger, former Lieut. Gov. Phil Batt.
Mr. Batt, who hoped to become the state's first Republican governor in 29 years, tried to paint Mr. EchoHawk as a clone of President Clinton.
Larry LaRocco, a two-term Democratic Representative, fell far behind in his bid to keep his Boise seat from a Republican energy consultant, Helen Chenoweth. Mr. LaRocco's campaign stumbled in October when it was revealed that his former brokerage firm had paid his female assistant $40,000 to settle a sexual discrimination lawsuit. In his previous race, Mr. LaRocco said rumors of the relationship were a lie, but he was forced to backpedal and acknowledge it this time around.
 
 GOVERNOR, 62% reporting
 Batt, 121,907, 52%
 Echohawk, 104,499, 45%
 
MONTANA
Senator Conrad Burns was on his way toward defying expectations in his bid to become the first Republican re-elected to the Senate from solidly Democratic Montana.
Democrats had hoped that the Senator's poor ratings from voters and his spotty legislative record made his seat ripe for the picking. But his opponent, Jack Mudd, a lawyer and first-time candidate, was unable to mount a strong campaign.
A recent poll showed that Mr. Burns's support grew, from 44 percent at the start of the campaign to 51 percent at the end, despite a highly publicized remark in which he used a racial epithet. Mr. Mudd's support remained about 37 percent throughout the campaign.
In a hotly contested House race Pat Williams, an eight-term Democratic Representative, expected to fend off a challenge by Cy Jamison, former director of the Bureau of Land Management.
Voters appeared quite unlikely to support a measure requiring voter approval for tax increases.
 
SENATE, 56% reporting
Burns, 111,859, 61%
Mudd, 71,614, 39%
 
NEVADA
Nevada, at least, was a welcome place for the Democrats this year. Gov. Bob Miller was the person principally responsible for delivering Nevada to the Democratic column for Bill Clinton in 1992, and his Republican opponent this year, Assemblyman Jim Gibbons, worked tirelessly to remind voters of it, but to no avail.
Senator Richard H. Bryan, an incumbent Democrat was also re-elected.
Nevada's ballot was also bristling with propositions for the voters, including two that would add the state to the growing list of those trying to impose term limits on officeholders. But another ballot referendum would require a two-thirds vote of the Legislature to raise taxes.
 
 SENATE, 54% reporting
 Bryan, 73,067, 53%
 Furman, 54,3641, 39%
 GOVERNOR, 55% reporting
 Miller, 128,821, 54%
 Gibbons, 94,183, 40%
 
NEW MEXICO
Republicans once seemed to be within striking distance of gaining a Senate seat in New Mexico, but Senator Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat, was the winner in a tight race with Colin R. McMillan, a Republican rancher who had counted on Mr. Bingaman's support of President Clinton's land policies to swing rural voters his way.
As Mr. McMillan pulled to within 3 percentage points of Mr. Bingaman in recent polls, the Senator, who had been running a low-key issue-oriented campaign, ran negative television advertisements that questioned Mr. McMillan's support of Social Security and Medicare.
In response, the challenger called in big Republican guns like the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, and Dick Cheney, Mr. McMillan's boss when he was an Assistant Defense Secretary.
Despite the Democrats' 2-to-1 registration edge, Republicans appeared likely to win the governorship. With more than half the precincts reporting, Bruce King, the Democratic incumbent, trailed the Republican, Gary E. Johnson, by more than 10 percentage points. A former Democratic Lieutenant Governor, Roberto Mondragon, collected enough votes to establish his Green Party as a major party under the state's election law.
 
 SENATE, 77% reporting
 Bingaman, 173,901, 54%
 McMillan, 147,345, 46%
 GOVERNOR, 77% reporting
 Johnson, 160,561, 50%
 King, 127,971, 40%
 Mondragon, 33,873, 11%
 
OREGON
The Republicans had targeted the seat held by Representative Elizabeth Furse as one that was vulnerable. But Ms. Furse had the lead in early returns and was expected to hold on to her seat. One reason was that her Republican opponent, Bill Witt, a businessman, had been criticized for his past ties to the Oregon Citizens Alliance, a group promoting a conservative agenda that included a measure on the ballot to limit government protections for homosexuals. The proposal was behind in early returns.
Ms. Furse emphasized her support for abortion rights and opposition to the anti-gay rights initiative.
In the governor's race, John Kitzhaber, a Democrat and a doctor who designed Oregon's health care rationing plan, beat Denny Smith, a former Republican Congressman.
Mr. Kitzhaber's path to the Democratic nomination was cleared this year when Gov. Barbara Roberts, the Democratic incumbent, announced she would not run.
Also on the ballot, and expected to win approval, was a measure to allow the terminally ill to obtain lethal prescriptions for suicide.
 
 GOVERNOR, 36% reporting
 Kitzhaber, 199,490, 53%
 Smith, 152,513, 41%
 
UTAH
Although Utah has been in the forefront of the term-limits movement, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the 60-year-old Republican and Judiciary Committee power, handily won a fourth term. His opponent, Patrick A. Shea, a former State Democratic Party chairman, proved to be only token opposition.
Utah had one of the more interesting House races in the re-election effort of Karen Shepherd, matched again with her 1992 opponent, Enid Greene Waldholtz. Ms. Shepherd, a Democrat who as a freshman championed changing how Congress works, had received contributions from unions despite voting for the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. A conservative independent, Merrill Cook, who finished second in the 1992 governor's race, was running neck-and-neck with the other two.
Voters were also deciding on a term-limit petition, financed by Mr. Cook, that could produce a bizarre situation if passed, leaving Utah with conflicting laws on the subject.
 
SENATE, 16% reporting
Hatch, 195,428, 68%
Shea, 83,231, 29%
 
WASHINGTON
Whenever political analysts looked for examples this autumn of anti-incumbent sentiment, rising Republican strength and public distaste for aging Democratic Congressional leaders, they looked first to Speaker Thomas S. Foley. The 15-term Democrat struggled hard for re-election, trailing his Republican opponent, George Nethercutt, by as much as 19 percentage points in September polls.
With nearly half the vote counted, Mr. Foley lagged by six percentage points. But a survey of voters leaving the polls indicated a very close race.
Even if Mr. Foley won, he faced the possible ignominy of no longer leading House Democrats, not to mention the House.
Young Democrats in the chamber have chafed for years at his reluctance to match the partisan tone of House Republicans and could look for a more combative replacement if they become the minority party.
Mr. Nethercutt, the 50-year-old chairman of the Spokane County Republican Party, played on voter hostility toward the Federal Government, accusing Mr. Foley of favoring unnecessary social spending and broad gun controls. Mr. Foley responded that as Speaker he had brought Federal jobs to the state. To reassure gun owners in his district, the state's easternmost and one of the most conservative, Mr. Foley shot a few rounds at a firing range.
Senator Slade Gorton, a Republican, did win re-election, beatingelection, beating Ron Sims, a member of the County Council in King County, which includes Seattle. So broad was the Democratic rout that the state's House delegation, now eight to one Democratic, could become seven to two Republican.
 
 SENATE, 46% reporting
 Gorton, 382,036, 56%
 Sims, 295,068, 44%
 
WYOMING
The least-populous state ranks among the most dependent on Federal cattle-ranching and mining subsidies, which the Clinton Administration wants to cut. Republicans won the races for governor and the Senate by linking their Democratic opponents to the unpopular Administration.
Representative Craig Thomas beat Gov. Mike Sullivan in the race to replace Senator Malcolm Wallop, a Republican who is retiring. Mr. Thomas contended that Mr. Sullivan, a longtime friend of the President, would vote against Wyoming's interests.
Jim Geringer, a Republican State Senator, defeated Kathy Karpan, Wyoming's Democratic Secretary of State, to replace Mr. Sullivan in the House.
Two ballot propositions were closely fought. One would allow slot machine gambling, and the other would subject people performing abortions to felony prosecution, except in cases of rape or incest or when the woman's life was in danger. Women having abortions would not risk prosecution.
 
 SENATE, 82% reporting
 Sullivan, 66,199, 41%
 Thomas, 93,450, 57%
 GOVERNOR, 82% reporting
 Geringer, 792.759, 57%

PIPER JAFFRAY COS. (PJC,N)

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Shareholders of the Piper Jaffray Companies saw their dividend cut yesterday as the securities firm prepared to defend itself against lawsuits stemming from its management of bond mutual funds. Piper Jaffray also said earnings fell almost 70 percent in its fourth quarter.
"While the ultimate outcome of the litigation cannot be determined, we believe it is prudent to reduce the dividend at this time," said Addison Piper, the company's chairman and chief executive. 
 Piper Jaffray is being sued by a group of individual shareholders and a teamsters' union affiliate who contend that the company did not properly disclose risks tied to investments made by the Institutional Government Income Portfolio and other bond mutual funds.
Piper Jaffray said it "has acted professionally, while adhering to legal and regulatory guidelines, in creating, marketing and managing these funds."
The company, based in Minneapolis, reported that net income fell to almost $3.57 million, or 20 cents a share, from $11.84 million, or 65 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. Revenue was down 15 percent, to $96.66 million. "Our revenues and earnings for the quarter and the year reflect the difficult financial markets that we and our competitors have been operating in since interest rates increased sharply beginning in February," Piper said.
Piper Jaffray's board decided to cut the quarterly dividend to 7.5 cents a share, from 17.5 cents, at a meeting on Monday. The company said the reduction brought its yield more in line with that of other brokerage firms, or to about 3 percent.(Bloomberg Business News)

 BODY:

VIRGINIA
In Brutal Battle, Robb Defeats North 
 In what may have been the bitterest fight of a bitter year, Senator Chuck Robb, a one-term Democrat, narrowly defeated Oliver North. Mr. North, the former national security aide to President Ronald Reagan, rallied an intensely loyal following among the religious right, opponents of gun control laws and bitter voters wanting to shake up Washington. But his involvement in the Iran-contra affair proved more damaging than the allegations of marital misconduct against Mr. Robb. Page B3.
 
GOVERNORSHIPS
Wilson and Weld Win; Bushes Split
Republicans swept all but one of the major governors' races. Gov. Pete Wilson, given up for politically dead two years ago as California staggered through a fierce recession, completed a stunning comeback by trouncing State Treasurer Kathleen Brown. Page B4.
In Masschusetts, Gov. William F. Weld easily turned back State Representative Mark Roosevelt, establishing himself as a possible player in the 1996 Republican Presidential sweepstakes. Page B3.
For two sons of President George Bush, it was a split decision, but not in the way experts had predicted. George W. Bush was elected in Texas, upsetting the incumbent, Ann Richards. But his younger brother, Jeb Bush, lost to Gov. Lawton Chiles in a close race in Florida.
For George W. Bush, the Texas triumph was sweet revenge against one of his father's old antagonists. The battle was close to the end, with Ms. Richards buoyed by the last-minute support of Ross Perot. Jeb Bush, a newcomer considered more conservative than his father, had been favored against the veteran Mr. Chiles. Page B4.
 
MASSACHUSETTS
Kennedy Beats Back Romney
Senator Edward M. Kennedy proved that after more than three decades on Capitol Hill, he is not ripe for replacing. In the toughest race of his career, the 62-year-old Senator beat a political newcomer with a larger personal fortune and another famous name, Mitt Romney.
 Mr. Romeny, the 47-year-old son of George W. Romeny, the former Governor of Michigan, had tried to tap this year's anti-incumbent fervor, arguing that it was time for a change, but on the stump and in political debates, Senator Kenney underscored his long experience, his comman of the issues and his intimacy with the legislative process.

Chicago Earthquake: Rostenkowski Is Out
If any seat in the House seemed safe at the outset of the year, it was that of Dan Rostenkowski of Chicago, longtime chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. But reeling under an indictment and an anti-Democratic wave in Illinois, the 66-year-old Mr. Rostenkowski lost to a 31-year-old political neophyte, Michael Patrick Flanagan. Page B3.

A Senate Sweep for the G.O.P.
Tennessee had two Democratic Senators. Now it will have two Republicans. Jim Sasser, a three-term Democratic incumbent who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and a close ally of President Clinton, lost to William Frist, a wealthy heart and lung surgeon who has never held public office.
And Fred Dalton Thompson, a lawyer for the Republicans on the Senate Watergate committee in 1973, defeated Representative Jim Cooper for the seat left vacant when Al Gore was elected Vice President. Page B3.

The Redemption Of Marion Barry
Marion Barry came back from the ignominy of a drug conviction to return as Mayor of Washington, defeating a Republican, Carol Schwartz. Mr. Barry served as Mayor from 1979 through 1990, when he was videotaped smoking crack in a hotel room with a woman who was not his wife. He was convicted and imprisoned. In this campaign, he stressed his strength of character in overcoming personal weakenesses. Page B4.

Upset Winner in '90 Is the Loser in '94
A pitched battle of ideological opposites ended with Representative Rick Santorum, a conservative Republican, narrowly defeating Senator Harris Wofford, a liberal Democrat. Mr. Santorum had aggressively promoted less government, lower taxes, more military spending and his opposition to a ban on assault weapons. Mr. Wofford, whose own upset victory four years ago put health care at the top of the national agenda, made Social Security the pivotal issue in this election.

HEADLINE: Gasoline Prices to Rise in Many Areas

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
New Federal clean-air rules will force drastic changes in the recipe used for gasoline in most urban areas in the next few weeks, and refiners and distributors are struggling to get supplies of the reformulated gasoline into place. Some analysts are predicting spot shortages and sudden price surges.
"We're going to have the biggest change in gasoline chemistry ever, even bigger than what we saw when we went to unleaded gas in 1973 and 1974," said William Berman, chief environmental affairs lobbyist of the American Automobile Association. 
 The new rules will instantly cover about 30 percent of the national gasoline market, nearly 30 million gallons a day, enough to fuel 43 million passenger cars. By contrast, the last big change, to unleaded fuel, was gradual, with only enough produced at first to supply 1974 model cars.
The areas where the new gasoline will be required are most of the Boston-New York-Washington megalopolis, extending south to Richmond, north to most of coastal Maine and west to much of western Pennsylvania; the Chicago region, including northeastern Indiana and eastern Wisconsin; sections of Kentucky in the Louisville area and near Cincinnati; the Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth areas, and the Los Angeles and San Diego areas.
Some of those areas already require fuel with special characteristics but the new rules are much stricter.
Distributors must have the new fuel on hand by Dec. 1, and refiners in areas where reformulated gasoline is required must have switched over completely by Jan. 1. In many areas, retailers are already pumping the new fuel, although most preferred to wait as long as possible because the it is more expensive.
The new fuel, designed to cut smog by 20 percent, will burn more thoroughly, evaporate more slowly, and even smell different. It will have sharply reduced levels of compounds like toluene and benzene, which refiners have used for years to enhance octane but which scientists have determined are toxic.
And the reformulated fuel will cost more, because it will require more refining and must include oxygen-containing molecules. That oxygen requirement is contributing to a temporary shortage of gasoline ingredients that contain oxygen. The "oxygenated" gasoline now costs about 9 cents a gallon more than ordinary fuel at wholesale.
Experts say that the cost of the oxygen-containing additives may decline, becoming no more per gallon than the cost of the gasoline it is blended with. But in the long term, drivers will probably pay 4 to 6 cents a gallon more for reformulated gasoline, because of the additional refining work needed.
Other than price, drivers probably will not notice much change. "The customer is not going to see a change in vehicle performance, in the sense of acceleration, riding down the road, knock, or anything else," said Reginald R. Modlin, the manager of vehicle emissions regulatory planning at Chrysler. "What we're talking about is emissions performance."
Some automotive experts say, though, that the new gasoline is likely to be blamed for anything that goes wrong with a car after Jan. 1.
The new gasoline, like the old, is a potpourri of hydrocarbon molecules derived from crude oil. But in unreformulated gasoline the largest of those molecules tend to go through engines without burning, so the new rules will allow fewer of the big molecules. In addition, the smallest molecules tend to evaporate easily, which also adds to air pollution, so the new gas will have fewer of those.
As a result, refiners will have to fuse the smallest molecules, and break up the biggest, or take those materials out of the gasoline altogether. None of the technology is complicated, but it involves more refining equipment and more work.
The law also has "anti-dumping" provisions, so that chemicals taken out of reformulated gasoline cannot be thrown into the mix in rural areas and other places that do not now have an air pollution problem.
This has created logistical problems for refiners and distributors. "You're basically introducing yet another kind of gasoline," said Bryan Davis, a spokesman for Sun Oil Company. But the number of pipelines and storage tanks is not changing. "It's like putting something new on the shelf without building any more shelves," he said.
Some experts are predicting sudden swings in the gasoline prices of 25 cents a gallon or more. "We're heading into a situation where it's going to be very, very tight in January," said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an economist who specializes in energy markets, at Charles River Associates, a consulting company based in Boston.
Others think the new rules will raise prices because they will reduce competition in the marketplace. Edwin S. Rothschild, of Citizen Action, a nonprofit group in Washington, said that major oil companies would have an easier time complying with the new rules than small companies, which formerly imported much of their gasoline and now would find it harder to obtain supplies that meet the complicated new specifications.
And, he said, companies would no longer be able to swap supplies so easily, because "unleaded regular" is no longer one product, but two, reformulated and unreformulated.
And some places where reformulated gasoline is not required will end up using it anyway, because the terminals or tanker trucks may change over to the new fuel for all of their distribution area, even if only part of it must have the new fuel.
Even the rules governing who must have the reformulated gas are a patchwork. For nine urban areas the changes are mandated by the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990; 40 other areas decided to require the new gasoline, in preference to other measures to clean up the air, like stricter controls on factories or tougher car inspections or new rules on new cars. Refiners expect more areas to voluntarily adopt the new fuel, which may eventually cover more than half the national market.
The rules taking effect on Jan. 1 are only the first stage; the Clean Air Act calls for stricter rules on Jan. 1, 1998, and a third phase, stricter yet, on Jan. 1, 2000.
This January, motorists who keep careful track may notice a decline in mileage of about 1.5 percent, because the new fuel has more molecules that contain an oxygen atom. The idea is to provide more oxygen in the cylinder, so when the fuel is burned, the exhaust contains less carbon monoxide, which is poisonous, and more carbon dioxide, which is not. But the oxygen-containing molecules have less energy.
A national program to require oxygenated gasoline in wintertime, when carbon monoxide is a problem, began in late 1992; it is now entering its third winter. But the new reformulated gasoline also calls for oxygenated fuel, and that will be year-round.
The oxygenate most popular with refiners is methyl tertiary butyl ether, known as MTBE, but it is now in short supply, because of the increased demand, combined with recent breakdowns at refineries that make the ingredients of MTBE. MTBE usually sells for about the same price per gallon as unleaded gasoline, 65 cents, but it is now selling for double that.
As a result, gasoline with oxygenates is now selling at wholesale for about 9 cents a gallon more than regular gasoline; last winter the difference was only 3.5 cents.
A 9-cent increase at retail would be large if it came suddenly. But prices show a considerable variation over the period of a few months. According to the American Automobile Association, the national average price for a gallon of self-serve regular unleaded was $1.065 in March vs. $1.188 in August. The most recent figure, for mid-October, was $1.157 a gallon.

The new rules will instantly cover about 30 percent of the national gasoline market, nearly 30 million gallons a day, enough to fuel 43 million passenger cars.

HEADLINE: In Mozambique and Other Lands, Children Fight the Wars

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOANE, Mozambique

 BODY:
In the rebel camps where Alberto Matevui spent five years of his childhood, he says the commanders usually called upon the young boys to perform the executions.
The victim might be an uncooperative hostage, or an adult guerrilla who had disobeyed an order, or a child soldier who had tried to escape. 
 The commander would summon the camp as if for a school assembly and select one of the new boys to do the killing. If he did well, he might be rewarded with the right to carry a pistol and to order the other children around.
"Sometimes they were younger than me," Alberto said of the executioners. He was 10 when he was kidnapped into the rebel movement called Renamo, and even now, restored to his family at the age of 15, barefoot and baby-faced, he looks scarcely old enough for the Boy Scouts.
Alberto Matevui's war is over, and Mozambique's first elections have brought hope of healing after a conflict in which one million people are estimated to have died. But experiences like his have begun to galvanize international agencies and human rights groups.
In Sudan and Liberia, Angola and Rwanda, Afghanistan, Cambodia and the Middle East, child soldiers are a repellent commonplace of warfare, said Samir Basta, director of the Geneva office of the United Nations Children's Fund. The fund is one of several organizations that has seized on the issue with fervor, though with little hope of curtailing the practice.
Children, it turns out, make good killers. They learn fast, they work cheap, and their sense of right and wrong has not outgrown their yearning to be accepted by whatever liberation group or guerrilla army has become their surrogate family.
"In Rwanda and other places, the perpetrators of some of the worst atrocities were children," Mr. Basta said. "They want to belong and be praised, and their only peer approval may come from being even more brave or barbarous than the adults."
Besides, he added: "Guns are toys. You give somebody a machine gun, and, my God, what a toy!"
Reynaldo Mucavel, who has been tracing the families of child soldiers in Mozambique for the American agency Save the Children, said he had interviewed many youngsters sent by rebels to kill and pillage in their own villages, a tactic apparently aimed at securing the loyalty of young troops while demoralizing civilians.
"I know of one case of a kid who was asked to shoot his mother and father and then cut their necks like he was cutting an onion," said Mr. Mucavel. "He did it. He was 8 years old."
In some cases, children go to war out of desperation, because in a battle-starved economy it is the only way to get food and clothing and occasional provisions to send home to the family.
In other cases, in the Middle East, the former Soviet republics or the remnants of Yugoslavia, young teen-agers are caught up in a nationalist or patriotic spirit.
"In Lebanon or Iran, the parents themselves are proud that their kids go to war and become martyrs and so on," Mr. Basta said. "In the former Yugoslavia, we saw many young people volunteering and wearing these Rambo-like uniforms. They feel brave, they feel manly, they feel that their families expect it of them."
And sometimes, as in Mozambique, where civil war mangled the country for 16 years, children were snatched from their homes and press-ganged into service.
According to Save the Children, both Renamo and the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front pressed children into combat, although the rebels were by far the worse offenders.
Save the Children has matched 8,000 Mozambican children with their families, and has lists of 4,000 more still searching for their parents. Some are children of families scattered during the fighting, but most were either soldiers or camp servants for the warring rivals.
Agostinho Mamade, who is in charge of the matching program, said the search is complicated by the fact that 5 million Mozambicans were uprooted by the war in addition to the million estimated to have died. And some children were stolen so young that they cannot remember the names of their villages.
"We had boys from 8, trained and forced to commit atrocities," said Mr. Mamade. Boys younger than eight helped in the camp until old enough for military training. Girls were kidnapped for the sexual amusement of the men, or to cook and clean.
Alberto Matevui's case was not unusual.
In June 1989 he was tending the village cows with his friend Felisberto Massicuane when a guerrilla patrol came to the outskirts of their village near here. The village is so small it is known only as Kilometer 16, its distance from Maputo.
The gunmen snatched the two boys and Alberto's 9-year-old sister. The friend escaped after a few months. (Asked his career ambitions, he said he wants to be a soldier.) The sister was set free two years ago when a cease-fire began. Alberto was released last July, after Save the Children traced his family.
Alberto said he was trained to use an AK-47 assault rifle, but half-heartedly insisted he was never called on to shoot anyone. Brown eyes downcast, he spoke reluctantly of his experience, recalling mainly long periods without food.
When they began their matching project, Mr. Mamade said, Save the Children had a therapist to counsel the tiny warriors, but the project was soon overwhelmed by the numbers. The agency decided the best therapy was to get the children quickly home.
As a result, there is only anecdotal evidence of the emotional damage inflicted by a childhood at war, and little understanding of how quickly children recover.
"It's difficult to guess what kind of human being you have who lived his whole life in a military environment, and a bloody one, a very cruel one," said Mr. Mamade, who is 31 years old and the father of two children. As for comprehending how anyone could force such a life on a child, he said, "I've given up."
For Mozambique, whose rival armies have been recast by the elections as rival political parties, there is also the question of whether these cruelties will lurk in the national psyche like the numberless mines buried in the landscape.
The other day in Alberto's village, two parents of children kidnapped by the Renamo rebels sat in the slanting light of late afternoon and discussed the prospects of reconciliation.
Antonio Sitoe, whose son and daughter were stolen by the guerrillas and recently recovered, was the voice of resignation: "If they are elected, you have to accept. They are going to govern us, and we must accept them."
But Alberto's mother, Marta Matusse, was having none of that.
"Myself, I will never forgive them," she declared. "If they were living among us in the village, in time we would forgive them, though we would not forget. As it is, I cannot forgive what they have done."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: STATES
THE PRESIDENT;
One Hand Tied, Clinton Offers the Other

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Even as President Clinton reached out to victorious Republicans, the White House was casting about today for ways to govern that would not require Congressional cooperation.
Looking somewhat chastened and sounding very conciliatory at a White House news conference, President Clinton accepted his share of responsibility for the devastating defeats suffered by Democrats in Congress, and he said that he would try to seek common ground with Republicans on issues like welfare reform. 
 But while congratulating Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, who is almost certain to be the new majority leader, and Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the apparent next Speaker of the House, Mr. Clinton also warned that his political rivals must now do their part to help him govern.
"We were held accountable yesterday," Mr. Clinton said of Democrats in the White House and Congress. He said that Republicans would now have "a larger responsibility for acting in the best interest of America." He called on them "to join me in the center of the public debate where the best ideas for the next generation of American progress must come."
But the White House was grim today as Mr. Clinton's advisers tried to grapple with the magnitude of the defeat. With both houses of Congress soon to be in hostile hands, advisers to Mr. Clinton said today that he recognized that much of his legislative agenda might be doomed.
The advisers said that Mr. Clinton might have to resort to regulations, executive orders and other Presidential tools to work around Capitol Hill, much as Ronald Reagan and George Bush did when the House and Senate were in Democratic hands.
For instance, President Bush used executive orders to allow states to experiment with new approaches to welfare. Mr. Clinton has already begun to follow that example.
"There's a lot you can do without Congress, and believe me, we'll be looking at everything," a senior White House official said.
The aides also spoke with apprehension about the likelihood that Republicans led by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York would intensify a Congressional inquiry into the Whitewater affair to make it a permanent distraction. Mr. D'Amato is in line to be the new chairman of the Banking Committee.
These advisers said the President had concluded that it would be pointless to spend the second half of his term waging a confrontation with Capitol Hill across a broad front. They said he would aim to strike accords with Republicans on measures that have bipartisan support, like an effort to overhaul the welfare system.
But the President now expects only modest changes in the health care system, they said, and has little chance of winning backing for the new domestic spending he has portrayed as a necessary investment.
The President will also have to contend with initiatives like a balanced-budget amendment and term limits that Republicans have made central to their campaigns and that they are now likely to try to rush into law.
Mr. Clinton has been opposed to both proposals, but his chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, equivocated today when asked about them, suggesting that he could be open to a compromise.
The advisers say that while Mr. Clinton will almost certainly have to begin exercising his veto power, he is wary of being seen as the kind of obstructionist that he has spent two years railing against.
Asked at his news conference today about the road ahead, Mr. Clinton said, "I will still work for the things that make America strong." But as he called repeatedly for bipartisan cooperation, he conceded that his own power had been substantially diminished. "A lot has changed since yesterday," the President said.
Mr. Clinton and his advisers had steeled themselves for the prospect of Democrats' losing the Senate, and some had warned that the House, too, might be at risk. But none had foreseen that the losses would be so heavy. While he did not name any of them, the President took time to express regret that Congress would now be without so many Democrats whom he said had "made this a lot better country."
The Republican victories are the biggest setback for Mr. Clinton since 1980, when he lost his first bid to be re-elected governor of Arkansas, and he plainly recognized that today marked an important moment. He told reporters he had taken time to reread the speech he gave as he began his quest for the Presidency three years ago, when he said that the job of government was to create opportunity and let citizens assume the responsibility for making the most of it.
"They don't think we've done that yet," he said, and his advisers conceded that he might now be badly weakened as he begins an expected quest for a second Presidential term.
The President had traveled nearly nonstop for the last three weeks to build support for Democrats by calling attention to his achievements at home and, with four frenetic days in the Middle East, to what he had accomplished abroad. He stayed awake until at least 2 A.M. today to monitor the returns, his aides said. His voice was hoarse, and there were deep bags under his eyes as he appeared at the afternoon news conference, his first public appearance since the election.
In an opening statement, Mr. Clinton tried to call attention to areas in which Republicans and Democrats had taken similar approaches to solutions. He said it was vital that they work together to promote further economic recovery and continued cuts in the Federal deficit.
Mr. Clinton said he would also support Republican efforts to give the President a line-item veto, a tool that he said would make it easier to hold the line on Government spending.
But he made clear that he would oppose attempts by Republicans to redeem the full range of promises made in the party's Contract With America, in which candidates committed themselves to a program of tax cuts and spending increases that Mr. Clinton denounced as a return to the economically destructive policies of the 1980's.
He promised to block any proposals that would "take us back to the policies that failed us before." And he said he would strongly object if Republicans tried to repeal the ban on assault weapons or the controls on handguns approved by Congress over their objections.
The President's tone today was far more gentle than it has been on the campaign trail, where he spent the final days before the election attacking Republicans as members of a party willing to let Americans suffer as the price for political success. Repeatedly, he called for bipartisan cooperation and said that he accepted part of the responsibility for the Democrats' defeat.

THE SPEAKER;
Foley, Defending Congress to the Last, Concedes Election Defeat by Newcomer

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SPOKANE, Wash., Nov. 9

 BODY:
The House Speaker, Representative Thomas S. Foley, a 30-year incumbent, has always said that the best way to insure term limits was at the ballot box. On Tuesday, voters in eastern Washington followed his advice.
Mr. Foley conceded today at midday, even though he trailed the Republican challenger, George Nethercutt, by only 2,200 votes with 14,000 absentee ballots still to be counted. The odds appeared too long to make up, Mr. Foley said. 
 If the numbers hold up, he will be the first Speaker ousted by the voters since 1860, when William Pennington of New Jersey was defeated.
But with Mr. Foley's fall coming at the end of a Republican national sweep in the House and Senate, that distinction did not seem to matter much. In the end, he was another casualty, going down with other House Democrats, including some from the leadership.
The storm that hit Mr. Foley also produced the biggest numerical change, by party, of any state's House delegation. Washington, considered a Democratic stronghold, went from an 8-to-1 Democratic alignment to 7 to 2 in favor of the Republicans.
In defeat as throughout his Speakership, Mr. Foley, who is 65, defended Congress as an institution that the press and voters had unfairly disparaged.
"Despite what people say, the overwhelming majority of members, both Democrat and Republican, are wonderful, upstanding and talented people," he said today.
He refused to answer questions about whether he would consider taking a White House appointment. He has been mentioned as a possible successor to Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
In a year when all politics was national, Mr. Foley could not save himself by emphasizing his ability to bring Federal dollars and prestige to this district, a long stretch of farm and forest land from the Canadian border to Oregon.
Exit polls showed that the overwhelming reason people voted against Mr. Foley was that they thought he had been in Congress too long. He has represented this district since 1964, a point made clear today as the Speaker thanked a long list of Presidents with whom he served, beginning with Lyndon B. Johnson.
Throughout the campaign, he was criticized for opposing term limits and characterized as a career politician and creature of Congress who had become removed from local concerns. "He's a Washington, D.C., man, not a Washington state man," said Kathy Cruz of Spokane, who campaigned for Democrats in the past but switched parties this year. She wore a button that said, "We made history."
Mr. Foley suffered rare indignities in recent months for a House Speaker. Fighting round-the-clock slights on local talk radio, he took to the airwaves, only to be asked questions like whether he is a homosexual. Mr. Foley, who has been married for more than 20 years, said he is not gay.
At times in the last month he seemed unable to comprehend how much his vision of government was at odds with that of so many of his constituents. When, he argued in a debate, for example, that government could be a force for good in areas like education, he was booed.
His opponent, Mr. Nethercutt, a 50-year-old Spokane lawyer who is a political neophyte, could not have represented more of a contrast. He played up his inexperience in government, saying he wanted to return to something closer to the part-time Congress of old.
"This vote is a voice of the people to change the system in Washington," said Mr. Nethercutt, who has promised to serve no more than three terms. "That's what we are really about."
Mr. Foley, stunned by the magnitude of the Democratic loss nationwide, said in an interview late Tuesday night that the Democrats failed to communicate their accomplishments.
"If the public believes the deficit is going up when it's going down, that we are in a recession when in fact we've added millions of new jobs, that's a problem of perception," he said. "But perception is reality in this day of politics."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Surges as Analysts See Improved U.S. Outlook

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar surged yesterday, and some analysts cited expectations that the big Republican gains in elections on Tuesday would mean an improved outlook for the United States economy.
"The feeling is that Republicans are going to be more fiscally conservative and bring down inflation expectations, which would be good for the dollar," said David Durst, vice president at Bear, Stearns & Company. 
 For the first time in 40 years, Republicans took control of both the House and Senate -- putting the two chambers at odds with President Clinton.
In the days leading to the elections, the dollar fell, as analysts warned that the currency would suffer if the Republicans gained a majority in both houses.
Analysts predicted that a Republican victory would weaken the President's efforts to push legislation through Congress and thus reduce investors' confidence in the currency. Foreign investors often shun the currency of a country whose leader is perceived to be weak.
But in overnight trading in Asia and Europe, the dollar rallied strongly, surprising a number of analysts.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.5315 German marks, from 1.5092 marks on Tuesday. The dollar rose to 97.80 yen, from 97.11 yen on Tuesday.
"The dollar moved up based on the assumption that there would be less spending from the Administration, which would benefit the bond market," said Hillel Waxman, vice president at the Bank Leumi Trust Company of New York.
But traders said it would take more than a changing of the Congressional guard to remedy the fundamental problems that have recently plagued the dollar.
"What has been weighing on the dollar are inflation concerns," said Amy Smith, a currency analyst at the consulting firm Idea.
The dollar rose against most other currencies. The British pound fell to $1.6055, from $1.6184 on Tuesday. The dollar rose to 1.2825 Swiss francs, from 1.2615 francs; to 5.2502 French francs, from 5.1838 francs, and to 1,569.50 Italian lire, from 1,550 lire. But the Canadian dollar rose to 73.83 United States cents, from 73.76 cents.

HEADLINE: Aristide Promises Greater Aid To Haiti's Impoverished North

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: CAP-HAITIEN, Haiti, Nov. 9

 BODY:
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, on his first foray to the provinces since being restored to office last month, promised jobs, markets, roads, water and school supplies today to thousands of cheering residents in the northern town of Cap-Haitien.
"This work will be done quickly," he told an audience of more than 2,000 people as hundreds of supporters waved handkerchiefs and hats to the beat of a snare drum and trumpet. Others sang "Aristide Baby, Oh, Aristide Baby!" 
Ringed by American and Guatemalan soldiers, President Aristide said he would bring at least 50 markets to northern Haiti. He vowed to build roads in a region devoid of all but rocky paths and said 39,700 pounds of food would soon be distributed to local hospitals. He also promised to send supplies to state schools.
President Aristide said he would present the proposals at a Cabinet meeting on Thursday "so the people of the north feel this is not just words but action."
But the crowd was not so enthusiastic when it came to the subject of reconciliation with the military leaders who took control of the country for three years. Most refused to reply when he asked, "Are we going to work for justice and reconciliation?"
When the response was tepid, he cried out: "I'll ask one more time. Are we going to work for justice and reconciliation?" The crowd's response was louder then.
As if to illustrate his commitment to putting the past behind him, the Roman Catholic priest embraced the region's right-wing bishop, Francois Gaillot, who was seen as an ally of the former military Government.
President Aristide thanked American soldiers for their support in helping to restore him to the presidency and called on the United States to keep aiding Haiti. "I congratulate you and I am proud of you and I ask you to continue working," he said in English.
He stayed here for two hours before returning by helicopter to Port-au-Prince with the United States Ambassador, William L. Swing.

Californians Pass Measure On Aliens; Courts Bar It

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Californians overwhelmingly approved a new law cutting off most government services to illegal aliens on Tuesday, but Gov. Pete Wilson's orders to begin enforcing some of its provisions today were immediately blocked by Federal and state judges.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat who opposed the popular initiative as too restrictive, claimed victory in a closely fought race against Representative Michael Huffington, a Republican who supported the measure. Mr. Huffington has not conceded pending a count of the absentee ballots. 
 The immigration initiative, called Proposition 187, passed by a margin of 3 to 2 with the strong backing of Mr. Wilson, who had made the costs of illegal immigration a central theme of his own successful re-election campaign. The measure denies welfare services, nonemergency medical treatment and public schooling to foreigners living in the state illegally.
United States District Judge Matthew Byrne Jr. today barred enforcement of the measure's provisions for one week, until he can hold a hearing. A San Francisco Superior Court judge blocked enforcement of the provision that denies schooling to children who are illegal aliens. A flurry of lawsuits were filed today challenging the measure's constitutionality.
At the same time, law enforcement officials around the state urged disappointed opponents of Proposition 187 to remain calm and not take to the streets in rowdy protest, as they had done in the days leading up to Tuesday's voting.
Mr. Huffington's strong support for the initiative, the most hotly debated issue in California this year, was apparently not enough to give him the edge against Senator Feinstein. Of votes cast at polling places, 47 percent went to Ms. Feinstein and 45 percent to Mr. Huffington -- a lead for her, but one so narrow that her opponent refused to concede until absentee ballots were counted.
"I'm very optimistic that I'm the victor," Ms. Feinstein said this morning.
Mr. Huffington countered that there were enough absentee ballots outstanding to tip the balance. "The election is still in the hands of the voters," he said.
Election officials said that if past voting patterns held, the absentee votes would closely track those cast at polling places.
Ms. Feinstein's apparent victory was particularly notable in an election in which most high-profile Democrats were swept aside by the Republican tide. Outspent two to one, pummeled by negative television advertisements portraying her as the ultimate Clintonite liberal and seared by the hyperheated debate over Proposition 187, she was able to convince voters that it was acceptable to be an unabashed "inside the beltway" incumbent and an ideological ally of President Clinton.
Surveys of voters leaving the polls on Tuesday indicated that besides the immigration issue, the Huffington-Feinstein contest was decided by factors, ranging from the candidates' experience and trustworthiness to the economy and crime.
Ms. Feinstein, a 61-year-old veteran of more than three decades in California public life, bested Mr. Huffington among voters when it came to experience and knowledge of the needs of California.
Mr. Huffington, a 47-year-old Texan who moved to California in the early 1990's and who has been in public life for less than three years, did better on crime and tax issues.
Ms. Feinstein ran particularly well among women, held on to most of the liberal and Democratic vote, outpolled the Congressman among moderates and independents, and even stole away some Republicans. She also captured the votes of most black and Hispanic voters.
After all their talk about the immigration problem, both candidates suddenly found themselves embarrassed near the end of the campaign by disclosures that they had employed illegal aliens as household workers. Both then stepped up their spending on television ads while the campaign became exceptionally mean-spirited, with the word "liar" the favored pejorative.
In Tuesday's exit polls, many voters said they found Mr. Huffington's huge personal campaign spending excessive and his advertising blitzes too negative. Many voters also faulted the Senator along those lines, but they were more forgiving of her than her opponent.
Mr. Huffington poured $28 million of his $70 million personal fortune into his campaign, spending most on relentlessly vituperative television advertisements that catapulted him from political unknown to serious contender.
All told, Mr. Huffington and Ms. Feinstein spent $42 million in their contest, $16 million more than had ever been spent in a Congressional race. Mr. Huffington alone exceeded the previous Congressional race spending record of $26 million.

HEADLINE: Researchers Ask Whether Prenatal Care Truly Saves Money

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA 

 BODY:
Prenatal care is often described as preventive medicine that pays for itself by averting future costs, but a new analysis says the savings have not been substantiated.
The investigators hasten to add that prenatal care is medically important and that all pregnant women should receive it. But they say the argument that for every dollar spent far more will be saved is a myth. 
 For more than a decade, it has been widely accepted that the cost of prenatal care will be more than offset by a reduction in the number of premature babies, whose medical costs can be astronomical.
This contention is used to persuade state legislatures to pay for prenatal visits for poor women, and is repeatedly cited by those who argue that preventive medicine must be included in health insurance programs.
The analysis of the prenatal-care literature was conducted by Dr. Frederick A. Connell, who directs the maternal and child health program at the University of Washington in Seattle, and Dr. Jane Huntington, an internist at the Group Health Cooperative in Seattle. Their paper is being published today in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Dr. Connell and Dr. Huntington looked at more than 100 papers claiming that prenatal care saves money by preventing the births of premature babies. Most papers cited the same few studies, and those studies, they found, were deeply flawed.
The researchers found that the studies, for example, compared babies born to women who had prenatal care with those of women who did not. But the women who did not receive care tended to be poorer and to have social problems like drug or alcohol abuse that might lead them to have low-birth-weight babies anyway.
The studies also assumed that routine care was enough to help poor women with complex problems. But most experts say women at high risk of having premature babies need intensive care, starting early in pregnancy, to identify problems like violence at home, poor nutrition, and drug and alcohol abuse. Such comprehensive care is much more expensive.
Most studies also made insupportable assumptions about the effectiveness of care and the medical costs of prematurity. They assumed, for example, that the care largely prevented the births of very premature babies, that is, those born after 28 weeks or less of pregnancy. But if prenatal care helps prevent prematurity at all, it prevents such births in the last three months of pregnancy, when medical problems are not nearly so severe, the researchers said.
Despite these problems with the studies, Dr. Connell and Dr. Huntington say, advocates of prenatal care have even put dollar amounts on the supposed savings, with what the researchers term "remarkable precision." Health planners have said that for every dollar spent on prenatal care, $1.70 or $2.57 or $3.38 will be saved.
Dr. Connell and Dr. Huntington say they have qualms about questioning the cost savings. "It's goring the sacred cow," Dr. Connell said. "I don't want this to be construed as an anti-prenatal-care article."
Other experts had the same concern. Dr. Bernard Guyer, chairman of the department of maternal and child health at the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health, said that even though the money-saving arguments do not stand up, "No one should ever interpret this as saying women shouldn't get good prenatal care and that prenatal care shouldn't be covered by public programs."
But Dr. Connell said, "It is disturbing that the public has so confidently and with such precision embraced the idea that prenatal care saves money." In part, he blames the scientific community, which at times seemed so eager to promote prenatal care for poor women that it glossed over the inadequacies of the cost-savings data.
Dr. Marie McCormick, chairwoman of the department of maternal and fetal health at the Harvard School of Public Health, said it was true that "justification of these services on a cost-benefit analysis is a weak reed," but added that "people were reduced to this kind of effort" by politicians reluctant to spend money on services for the poor.
Dr. McCormick said prenatal care could help women as well as babies, by detecting health and nutrition problems and helping women to stop smoking. But it may be too much to ask, given the social problems of poor women and the paucity of knowledge of how to prevent premature births, to expect it also to save money, she said.
Dr. Louise Russell, a research professor of economics at Rutgers University, said it had been a mistake from the start for scientists to promote the cost-savings argument. "If you try to sell it on cost savings, it will and should come back to haunt you," she said. "If it doesn't save costs, then people can come back and say that it isn't worth doing."
Dr. Russell said that well-meaning scientists and policy makers "who think prevention is a good thing are shooting themselves in the foot in trying to argue that it saves money, because it is absolutely not true."
"And that isn't the right ground to argue on," she added. "We don't go into medical care to save money. We go into it to improve health and save lives."
Dr. Connell said he sees another danger in "how the so-called data have been used." He said the public and politicians feel that once prenatal care is included in Medicaid programs, "they've solved the problem." But, he added, the problems are complex and involve nutrition, smoking, drug use, access to medical facilities and lack of education. "Our preoccupation with prenatal care takes us further from true solutions," he said.
Dr. Guyer, of Johns Hopkins, said: "These are very complicated social problems and they can't be solved by simplistic interventions. We should have been willing to say that earlier, but it wasn't easy in that political environment.
"I've had this argument with so many of my advocacy friends. When you're afraid to say what the information really shows, that worries me. Someone's going to find it out anyway. It's not that this article is bursting the bubble. The bubble was going to burst anyway."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: VOTERS
THE OUTCOME;
Asked to Place Blame, Americans in Surveys Chose: All of the Above

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

 BODY:
While Republicans touted their electoral surge on Tuesday as a repudiation of President Clinton and an endorsement of conservative Republican policies, there was little evidence that these motivations moved most voters.
Instead, voters who were surveyed as they were leaving their polling places blamed a host of factors for the nation's failures in solving problems. Indeed, a majority said that special interest groups and members of Congress from both parties were more at fault than the Clinton Administration. 
 Republicans scored their biggest gains among independents and men, winning support from both groups in much higher proportions than they have in years. Those who backed Ross Perot in the 1992 Presidential election voted overwhelmingly for Republicans. The party also drew significant support from the suburbs.
More Republicans than Democrats went to the polls. Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, estimated that the turnout was nearly 39 percent, more than two percentage points higher than in the mid-term elections of 1990. He said his projections showed that for the first time since 1970, more Republicans than Democrats voted.
Yet the encouraging results for Republicans were offset to some extent by voter survey findings that showed that the number of people who identify themselves as Republicans had not increased from four years ago. The electorate is still about evenly split between the two major political parties. And though the newly elected class of House and Senate Republicans has a conservative tilt, it does not appear to reflect an ideological shift among the voters. Almost half of the voters yesterday identified themselves as moderates.
The survey of 5,260 voters leaving polling places across the country was conducted by Mitofsky International, an independent organization in New York.
Short of an overall distaste for government, there was no unifying theme among voters who supported Republican candidates. For example, 4 out of 10 voters listed crime as the No. 1 issue that influenced their voting for House candidates. But of those people, half voted for Democrats and half for Republicans. In addition, 4 out of 10 voters said their voting for House candidates had nothing to do with Mr. Clinton.
Ruth Smith, a 49-year-old legal secretary in Houston who usually supports Democrats, said she had mixed feelings about the President but voted for several Republicans on the ticket out of a general frustration with the Government. "I feel like some of the good old boys have been there too long; they're complacent, owe too many people," Ms. Smith said. "They're not listening to what we're saying, what we want, the average American."
One voter who backed Mr. Perot but favored Republicans on Tuesday was Hugh Magnusen, 59, who owns a small vending machine business near Seattle. He said his distress over the Government was personified by two veteran Democrats who were defeated on Tuesday, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington and Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Chicago.
"It's a gigantic mess back in Washington, D.C., because of the Foleys and the Rostenkowskis," he said. "I just don't trust them."
It was a message that reached the Oval Office. At a news conference yesterday, Mr. Clinton said the voters were telling him: " 'Look, we just don't like what we see when we watch Washington. And you haven't done much about that. It's too partisan, too interest-group oriented, things don't get done. There's too many people up there playing politics. Democrats are in charge. We are holding you accountable, and we hope you hear this, Mr. President.' "
For months, Mr. Clinton has complained that voters do not give him credit for an improved economy. Indeed, the survey found that an overwhelming proportion of people who said that their standard of living was getting worse supported Republican House candidates. But almost as many voters said their standard of living was getting better, and most said they had voted for Democrats. More than half said it had stayed the same. They split evenly between Democrats and Republicans.
The Republican victories did not seem to reflect any new hostility toward Mr. Clinton. While 49 percent of voters said they disapproved of how he was handling his job, his popularity has hovered at that level for months. And the 44 percent who approved of his performance was only one percentage point more than his winning share of the vote two years ago.
Stanley Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's pollster, argued that Republicans would be misguided if they make too much of what the outcome says about the President. "The Republicans will make a very big mistake if they interpret this election as having settled the Clinton Presidency," he said. "The forces at work that threw them out in 1992 are still at work in '94. The Democrats were seen to be in power, which is why they paid the price."
While Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster, interpreted the results as a rebuke to Mr. Clinton, she, too, warned her party to not read too much into them. "The results show no particular allegiance to one political party," she said. "In '92 they punished a lot of Republicans. In '94 they punished a lot of Democrats. It seems to be that voters are still looking for change."
Although voters clearly wanted to send a message to Washington, there is little evidence that they were endorsing a Republican agenda. Recent polls have found that most voters did not know about the "Contract with America," a proposal signed by more than 300 Republican House candidates that called for cutting taxes, balancing the budget and increasing spending for the military.
Ned Lowry, 61, a retired engineer from Seattle who considers himself an independent, said he had voted for a Republican for the House for no other reason than that he did not like the Democratic candidate. "He was a turkey," Mr. Lowry said. He acknowledged that he had heard of the Republican contract but said his vote for a Republican "didn't have anything to do with it."
The survey also found that people who identify themselves as evangelical Christians and have been more visible in Republican politics this year voted overwhelmingly for Republicans. Six out of 10 backed Republican candidates for the House.
A particularly striking finding was an eight-point gap between men and women in voting for House candidates. Fifty-four percent of men voted for Republicans and 46 percent for Democrats; the figures were reversed for women.
This was the first time in eight elections that there has been as wide a division between male and female voters. The Republican edge among men greatly benefited candidates like George W. Bush, the former President's eldest son, who defeated Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas.
Still, many women switched to Republicans in their voting. Reva Holcomb, an 85-year-old retired secretary in Miami, said she voted for Republicans this year because Mr. Clinton "has been in power too long, and when you get too much power you go bad."
"I think the American people as a whole have lost confidence in their Government," she said.
But while Ms. Holcomb blamed the President, another Miami resident, Lorraine Watson, 32, was motivated more by statewide personalities. Ms. Holcomb, a nurse, said she usually votes for Democrats but could not bring herself to support Gov. Lawton Chiles, who was re-elected in a tight race with Jeb Bush, another son of the former President. "They say he's experienced," she said of Mr. Chiles, "but there's no change. We need a new guy."
The shift among independents was also significant. Fifty-six percent of those who identified themselves as independents voted for Republicans, while 44 percent voted for Democrats. The last time independents cast more of their votes for Republicans than for Democrats was in 1984, and the gap was narrower then, 51 percent Republican and 49 percent Democrat. People who voted for Mr. Perot backed Republicans by a 2-to-1 ratio.
An example of how independents voted came in the Michigan Senate race, where 53 percent chose the Republican candidate, Spencer Abraham, and 47 percent backed Representative Bob Carr, the Democrat who lost. And though Mr. Perot endorsed Governor Richards, a Democrat, almost twice as many independent voters backed Mr. Bush, the winner in the Texas governor's race.
Despite indications that there was much more at play in the results than Mr. Clinton and his policies, Democratic strategists sounded shell-shocked yesterday.
"I think the voters meant to send a major message to Clinton and the Democrats," said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, "and I think we'd be foolish to pretend otherwise."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: CONGRESS;
THE NEW FACES IN THE SENATE

 BODY:

ARIZONA
Jon Kyl, 52, Republican
The son of a Congressman, a lawyer and four-term House member, Mr. Kyl has been a strong critic of cuts in the Pentagon budget and played an important role in preserving spending for the Stars Wars program. In the race to succeed Senator Dennis DeConcini, the retiring Democrat, he campaigned against Representative Sam Coppersmith by emphasizing his opposition to abortion rights and President Clinton's health plan.
 
MAINE
Olympia J. Snowe, 47, Republican
A member of the House since 1978, Ms. Snowe defeated Representative Thomas H. Andrews to take over the seat now held by Senator George J. Mitchell, the Democratic leader, who is retiring. She entered politics in 1973 by running for the state House seat left vacant by the death of her first husband, Peter Snowe. A widely known and popular figure around the state, Ms. Snowe was one of a group of Republican women who called on President George Bush to modify his opposition to abortion rights. She supports a balanced budget amendment and in 1987 led the drive to have the new American Embassy in Moscow demolished after listening devices were discovered in it. Ms. Snowe is married to the state's governor, John McKernan. 

MICHIGAN
Spencer Abraham, 42, Republican
A former state Republican chairman, he was an aide to former Vice President Dan Quayle. His campaign tied Representative Bob Carr to President Clinton and to the Administration's deficit reduction plan, as well as to Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Democrat incumbent, who is retiring. One of Mr. Abraham's ads showed Mr. Carr's face metamorphizing into Mr. Riegle. Less negative and ideological than many other Republican candidates this fall, Mr. Abraham emphasized the need for the Federal Government to limit its work in fighting poverty to roles it serves well, rather than suggesting it is useless in the field.
 
MINNESOTA
Rod Grams, 46, Republican
A former television news broadcaster who won election to the House of Representatives in 1992, Mr. Grams decided to give up his House seat in a bid to replace Senator Dave Durenberger, who is retiring. Mr. Grams, who boasted early in the campaign of his 100 percent approval rating by the Christian Coalition, a conservative group, campaigned against his Democratic opponent, Ann Wynia, by stressing the need for a smaller Federal Government and a tougher approach to crime. He supports term limits and opposes abortion rights.
 
 
MISSOURI
John Ashcroft, 52, Republican
A lawyer, gospel singer and songwriter, Mr. Ashcroft was elected Governor in Missouri in 1984 after serving as state attorney general He won re-election handily in 1988, but was barred from a third term by state law. Last year, he ran unsuccessfully to become national Republican Party chairman. This fall, he cited the seven death row inmates executed during his tenure as proof that he is tough on crime and proposed cutting the cost of welfare by capping benefits at the previous year's level. He says he favors an incremental approach to health legislation, concentrating on changing insurance rules.
 
OHIO
Mike DeWine, 47, Republican
The lieutenant governor, he has spent his entire professional life in politics. He served as a county prosecutor, state senator, and four terms as United States Representative in addition to his current post. He captured this Democratic seat which Howard M. Metzenbaum, the retiring incumbent, had hoped to hand over to his son-in-law, Joel Hyatt, the founder of a chain of legal clinics. In addition to calling for tougher measures on crime, he said he would work to reform the Senate to make it more responsive. Mr. DeWine supports a requirement to balance the Federal budget.
 
OKLAHOMA
James M. Inhofe, 59, Republican
A three-term House member and former three-term mayor of Tulsa, Mr. Inhofe emphasized his conservative record in the race to replace Senator David Boren, the conservative Democrat who is resigning in mid-term to head the University of Oklahoma. His opponent, Representive Dave McCurdy, was a conservative Democrat much in the Boren mold; both men ran campaigns critical of President Clinton. Mr. Inhofe had to overcome a string of controversies about his business background, including a the failure of an insurance company he inherited and a Federal judge's order that he pay the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation more than $500,000 in a dispute over a loan.
 
PENNSYLVANIA
Rick Santorum, 36, Republican
A lawyer and former Congressional aide, he was first elected to the House in 1990, representing the Pittsburgh suburbs. An aggressive conservative, he criticized Senator Harris Wofford as an emblem of failed liberalism and as a supporter of President Clinton. Mr. Santorum fiercely opposes abortion, gun control, family leave and extending unemployment insurance. When he was criticized by a prominent local Republican, Theresa Heinz, the widow of Senator John Heinz, who held the seat until his death in 1991, he responded by suggesting she made the remarks because she is dating a Democrat, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.
 
TENNESSEE
Bill Frist, 42, Republican
A Nashville heart surgeon, Mr. Frist is a first-time candidate who first registered to vote in 1988. His family founded the Hospital Corporation of American, and Mr. Frist spent almost $2 million of his own money to oust Senator Jim Sasser. In one ad, he said he supported "term limits for career politicians and the death penalty for career criminals." He also called for tough welfare reform; he calls abortion a personal choice, though one he opposes; he is against gun control. But most of his energy in the campaign went into attacks on Mr. Sasser. "For the past 18 years, Bill Frist has been transplating hearts and lungs," he said at a recent rally. "For the past 18 years Jim Sasser has been transplanting your wallets."
 
Fred D. Thompson, 52, Republican
Mr. Thompson is a lawyer and lobbyist but many people know him best as a movie actor. He pursued a conservative anti-Washington line and regularly criticized his opponent, Representative Jim Cooper, for having voted last year for the Clinton deficit-reduction bill. An effective campaign speaker, he emphasized a down-home appeal to contrast with his opponent, who is a Rhodes Scholar. Mr. Thompson's political mentor has been former Senator Howard W. Baker, who hired Mr. Thompson as a counsel on the Watergate committee.
WYOMING
Craig Thomas, 61, Republican
First elected to the House in 1989 to fill the seat vacated by Dick Cheney, Mr. Thomas focused as much on President Clinton as on his opponent, Gov. Mike Sullivan, a long-time Clinton ally who was one of the first governors to endorse Mr. Clinton in 1992. In his race to succeed Senator Malcom Wallop, the Republican who is retiring, Mr. Thomas repeatedly railed against what he called Mr. Clinton's "War on the West." He also strongly criticized the Clinton health plan, calling instead for one that would have more flexibility in serving rural areas. Before going into politics he had a varied career in business, among other things working as general manager of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association and as a partner in a motel.

HEADLINE: The Election's Fallout for the Economy;
Stocks Rise, But Euphoria Doesn't Last

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Traders stormed into the stock market like a herd of elephants yesterday morning, pushing prices sharply higher in the wake of the Republican sweep of the House, the Senate and the governors' mansions.
But few investors followed them, and by the end of the day the herd had turned into bears as Wall Street debated the effect of the Republican victory; after falling at midday, blue-chip stocks recovered to eke out a tiny gain. 
 "There was euphoria overnight, because Republicans are more market-oriented than Democrats," said David Shulman, the investment strategist for Salomon Brothers. "But then reality set in: this is not going to change the Fed tightening." Most analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates on Tuesday, after its policy-making committee meets, a move that they do not expect to be good for the stock market. Nevertheless, the bond market and the dollar both rose slightly yesterday.
The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.01 points, to 3,831.75; the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 0.25 point, to 465.40. Stocks of smaller companies also dropped; the Russell 2,000 index edged down 0.43 point, to 251.69, while the Nasdaq composite index declined 0.29, to 767.25. Trading was heavy, as 337.9 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, where the average volume recently has been under 300 million. More stocks fell than rose; the ratio of declining to advancing stocks was 6 to 5.
Most of the action yesterday, analysts said, was generated by short-term traders, who were active in the options and futures markets. "To read any logic or long-term perspective into it is lunatic," said Michael Metz, chief strategist for Oppenheimer & Company.
Indeed, Wall Street does not seem to have a consistent view on whether the Republican victory will benefit investors over the long haul. There are deep divisions over that question among investment gurus and money managers -- even those who all work at the same firm.
For example, Tom Stiles, chief investment officer of Smith Barney Shearson's Greenwich Street Advisers, sounded a positive note, suggesting that the Republican victory had averted rancorous gridlock in Washington. "Instead, the Republicans will have something very close to a super-majority, and an activist leadership" that could cut the tax rate on investment gains, he said.
But Jeffrey Russell, who manages Smith Barney's largest international mutual fund, said he thought it likely that the Republicans would concentrate on thwarting President Clinton and trying to win the 1996 Presidential election rather than enacting a positive program. "Even if you are a rock-ribbed Republican," he wondered, "is this really a good development?"
And Hersh Cohen, president of Smith Barney Shearson Asset Management, said he did not think the election would have much effect on the market, for good or bad. "What happens in the political arena and events of the day, unless they are a total surprise like the Iran-Iraq war, well, the markets tend to do what they are going to do anyhow," he said. Anyway, he added, "All Republicans are is mean-spirited Democrats."
History buffs can find evidence on all sides. Republicans have taken credit for one of the biggest stock market rallies of all time in the 1980's. After Ronald Reagan entered the White House and Republicans took over the Senate in 1981, the Dow Jones industrial average almost doubled, to 1,896 at the end of 1986, when the Democrats regained dominance in the Senate. And in 1953 and 1954, when Dwight D. Eisenhower shared power with a Republican-controlled Congress, the market soared almost 40 percent.
But to find a situation exactly like the one about to occur in Washington -- a Democratic President and a Republican Congress -- analysts must look all the way back to 1947, when Harry S. Truman was in the White House and the Republicans held the House and Senate.
And there, precedent is not so positive. During 1947 and 1948, the market basically marked time; the Dow began that period at 177.20; it ended up two years later at 177.30.
Of course, there were many factors at work in the late 1940's, most notably the transformation to a peacetime economy. But that is always the case; trying to isolate the effect of politics on the stock market is like trying to isolate the taste of the bay leaf in the lamb stew, said Laszlo Birinyi, who runs a research firm in Greenwich, Conn. Anyway, he said, while the market may be focused on the election now, "by next week it will be, what election?"
Clearly, however, some stocks did get a big push from the election. The market cheered the apparent death of comprehensive health care legislation by bidding up the stocks of drug and medical companies. Merck, the giant pharmaceutical company, climbed 1, to 36 3/4, and was one of the most active stocks of the day. Other gainers included A. L. Pharma, a generic drug maker, which rose 1 5/8, to 17 3/4; United American Health, up 1 3/4, to 27, and Regency Health, up 5/8, to 11 3/4.
Local races also had an effect on some issues. The Long Island Lighting Company's shares dropped 1 3/8, to 16 3/8, as investors bet that the Republican Governor-elect, George E. Pataki, would not carry out Mario M. Cuomo's plan to take over the utility.
Casino stocks tumbled because voters rejected some measures to legalize gambling; International Game Technology, which makes slot machines, fell 1 5/8, to 18 7/8, and Promus, which runs Harrah's, dropped 2 3/4, to 30 1/2. But the same news on gambling buoyed the stock of Walt Disney, which successfully opposed legalizing casinos in Florida; the company's stock rose 1 1/4, to 42 1/4.


GRAPHIC: Before the 1929 market crash, the Republican Party often had a majority in both houses of Contress. But between 1930's election and 1994's, it only happend twice: A two-year term under a Democratic president, Harry Truman, and another two years under a Republican, Dwight Eisenhower.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: IN THEIR OWN WORDS;
Clinton: Voters Are Demanding That the Parties Work Together

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference today on the results of Tuesday's election, as transcribed by the Federal Information Systems Corporation, a private transcription service:
PRESIDENT CLINTON Ladies and gentlemen, last night and again this morning, I spoke with both Republicans and Democrats to congratulate those who won and console those who lost their elections. I also called the leaders of the next Congress, Senator Dole and Congressman Gingrich, to tell them, after this hard-fought campaign, that we are ready to work together to serve all the American people in a nonpartisan manner. 
 The American people sent us here to rebuild the American dream, to change the way Washington does business, to make our country work for ordinary citizens again. We've made a good start by cutting the deficit, by reducing the size of the Federal Government, by reinventing much of our Government to do more with less. We have increased our investment in education and expanded trade, and our economy has created more than five million jobs. We've also made a serious start in the fight against the terrible plague of crime and violence in this country. I remain committed to completing the work we have done.
Still, in the course of this work, there has been too much politics as usual in Washington, too much partisan conflict, too little reform of Congress and the political process. And though we have made progress, not enough people have felt more prosperous and more secure, or believe we were meeting their desires for fundamental change in the role of Government in their lives. With the Democrats in control of both the White House and the Congress, we were held accountable yesterday, and I accept my share of the responsibility in the result of the elections.
When the Republican Party assumes leadership in the House and in the Senate, they will also have a larger responsibility for acting in the best interest of the American people. I reach out to them today and I ask them to join me in the center of the public debate where the best ideas for the next generation of American progress must come. Democrats and Republicans have often joined together when it was clearly in the national interest.
For example, they have often chosen to put international affairs above politics. I urge them to do so again by passing the GATT agreement this year. Our prosperity depends upon it. And there can be no compromise when the national interest and the livelihood of American households are at stake.
Last night the voters not only voted for sweeping changes, they demanded that a more equally divided Congress work more closely together with the President for the interests of all the American people. So I hope that we can do that on GATT, and that by doing so we will pave the way for further cooperation on welfare reform and on health care reform, on a continued investment in our people's educational opportunities and the continued strength of our economy.
We must also take more steps to restore the people's faith in our political institutions and agree that, further, in the best tradition of our own foreign policy that politics will continue to stop at the water's edge.
To those who believe we must keep moving forward, I want to say again I will do everything in my power to reach out to the leaders and the members of this new Congress. It must be possible to make it a more effective, more functioning institution. It must be possible for us to give our people a Government that is smaller, that is more effective, that reflects both our interests and our values.
But to those who would use this election to turn us back, let me say this: I will do all in my power to keep anyone from jeopardizing this economic recovery by taking us back to the policies that failed us before. I will still work for those things that make America strong -- strong families, better education, safer streets, more high-paying jobs, a more prosperous and peaceful world. There is too much at stake for our children and our future to do anything else.
Well, a lot has changed since yesterday, but what hasn't changed is the reason I was sent here and the reason the members of the Congress will be sent here: to restore the American dream and to make this country work, this Government work, this city work for the interests of ordinary Americans again.
That is what the American people expect of us.
Last night they said they were not satisfied with the progress we have made. They said the Democrats had been in control of the White House and the Congress, they said they were going to make a change, and they did make a change. But they still want the same goal. I pledge today to work with all the members of the Congress, and especially the new Republican leadership, to achieve that goal. If they will work with me -- and they have pledged to do so today -- then we can make great progress for this country. We should be optimistic and we should work to make that optimism real.
 
Taking Responsibility
 
 
Q. Not a single Republican incumbent lost in any race for governor, House or Senate, while the Democratic party, your party, suffered its worst losses in four decades. Do you view this as a repudiation of you, or as another common denominator in this election that we're missing?
A. I think that I have some responsibility for it. I'm the President. I'm the leader of the efforts that we have made in the last two years, and to whatever extent that we didn't do what the people wanted us to do or they were not aware of what we had done, I must certainly bear my share of responsibility, and I accept that. There will be a lot of you doing exit surveys asking the American people what they meant and said. But what I think they said is they still don't like what they see when they watch us working here. They still haven't felt the positive results of things that have been done here that they agree with when they hear about them but they don't feel them.
They're still not sure that we understand what they expect the role of Government to be. I think they want a smaller Government that gives them better value for their dollar, that reflects both their interests and their values, that is not a burden to them but that empowers them. That's what I have tried to do, but I don't think they believe we're there yet by a long shot. They want us to do more.
I went back today and read my announcement speech for President, and I said in that speech that the job of Government was to create opportunity and then to expect citizens to assume the responsibility to make the most of that opportunity. I think that's about where the American people are. They don't think we've done that yet, and the only thing I think they knew to do yesterday was to try to make a change in the people who were in control and who had been. And I regret that some of the people who lost are people who made this a lot better country and who will always, when the history books are written, get the credit they deserve in the hindsight for helping to make the American people more secure.
I don't believe the American people were saying, "We're sorry the deficit has been reduced; we're sorry the size of Government has been reduced; we're sorry you've taken a tough stand on crime; we're sorry you're expanding trade." I don't believe that. I don't think they were disagreeing with a lot of the specifics.
Q. Do you think you would have survived if you were on the ballot yesterday?
A. Well, some Democrats did. I'd like to think I would have because I believe that I would have been a ferocious defender of what we have done.
 
Contract With America
 
 
Q. What do you think this does for your expected bid for re-election? And how will you deal with Contract For America if there are proposed cuts in Social Security and Medicare, veterans' benefits, the whole nine yards?
A. We've got plenty of time to worry about the next election. The American people are sick of the one they just had, and they want to get away from politics for a while. I think we should think about the people, their interests; I think we should say, what message were they sending us and what are we going to do about it, and how can we pull this country together, how can the Democrats and the Republicans in the Congress, and the White House and the Republican leadership work together in a nonpartisan way to push this country forward?
Now, on the contract, there are some things in that contract that I like. I hope the Congress will give me the line-item veto and do it quickly. If they do, we'll bring this deficit down even more quickly. I hope that we will have aggressive efforts to work together on welfare reform. I hope we will be able to still reduce several areas of Federal spending and continue this whole reinventing Government effort to do more with less.
The issue in the contract is what it has always been. I do not believe that we can afford to go back to the days of exploding deficits, which I believe would lead to a weaker economy, to lost jobs, and to a more difficult future for ourselves and our children.
So, the question there is how will all this be paid for? I do not believe -- now many Republicans in the campaign said they did not believe that we should cut Social Security or Medicare. So if we can't cut Social Security or Medicare if we must maintain the world's strongest defense which I think -- and the Republican leadership and I are strongly in agreement upon -- then what else are we going to do? And that will be a challenge.
 
Compromises Ahead?
 
 
Q. Do you think you'll be able to compromise with them on that?
A. I'm not going to compromise on my convictions, what makes America strong. We are stronger today but we have more strength to get. We have to have -- I'll say again what I think makes our country strong. Strong families, better education, safer streets, more high-paying jobs, a Government that reflects their values and the interests of the American people, and work to make a world that's more prosperous and peaceful.
Those are the principles on which I do not intend to compromise. But I want to work with them. Look, let me give you just one example. I have always wanted to make the tax code more fair. The tax code is more fair today than it was when I took office. We did cut income tax rates for families with incomes of up to $27,000. They want to go further than that. I would like to go further on that. The question is, how far can we go?
Can we focus on working families with children, how are we going to pay for it? We have to answer now, the details. And in large measure that is a question that can only be answered by some sort of partnership, and by getting their views. And again, I say, let's give them a day or two to enjoy their victory and then they'll have an opportunity to work for it.
 
The Federal Budget
 
 
Q. Would you support a tax cut, such as they propose in their Contract With America, of $500 for every family under $200,000 income if you don't think it's paid for? Or would you veto it? Would you get into that kind of confrontational mode with them on something specific?
A. They have to have a chance to look at the budget now. When you're in opposition you can be an advocate entirely, and you can put out ideas you think are good.
I hope we can find some way to continue to improve the fairness of the tax code and to help middle-class working Americans. When I was trying to reduce the deficit in 1993, and make the tax code fairer, we had to stop at $27,000 in income for families with children, working families with children, in our tax relief. I think perhaps we can go further, but I don't want to get into a lot of the details today. I'll just say that if we do this, we need to pay for it. We don't need to explode the deficit again.
 
Welfare and Health Care
 
 
Q. Government intervention seems to be what a lot of the voters ruled out, voted against. Are you willing to scale back your expectations in areas like health care and welfare reform, or are you going to go in with plans that look like the ones you had this past year and wait for them to compromise, or will you go to them with something less than you had asked before?
A. First of all, let me say if you look at the welfare reform issue, let's take that first. I sent them a bill last March that is quite similar to one that several Republicans themselves have proposed. I don't think anybody would characterize it as a Government-intervention bill. It's a bill designed to move people from welfare to work after a certain set time, to have tougher child-support enforcement, to provide education and training and support for people who go into the workplace so they can know their children are all right. I think there is over 80 percent support in this country among Americans of both parties, among people of all races and backgrounds, for doing something like this. So I think we will get an agreement.
On the health care issue, I will concede that by the time the folks who were characterizing our program had finished with it -- and one of your publications said that they thought about $300 million had been spent in lobbying against the health care reform -- it looked like a Government program designed to solve the problem by restricting the choices of the American people and injecting the Government more into health care. That is not what I want to do.
And I will concede this. I have got to find a way to reassure the American people that if they like what they've got, they can keep it.
But let me say, I remain committed to solving the health care problem. Last year another million Americans, almost all of them in working families, lost their health insurance. We have more and more people -- I talk to them all the time when I go out in the country -- small businesspeople and others who have health insurance that is so limited because their co-pays and deductibles are so high that all they've really got insurance against is losing their home if they get sick. So I remain committed to finding a way to keep Americans from losing their health insurance if they change jobs or someone in their family gets sick, to controlling the cost of increases in health care by market mechanisms, by -- to providing ways for people in small businesses and self-employed people to buy health insurance at the same rates that those of us in Government or big employers -- working for big employers can do it.
 
Whitewater Inquiry
 
 
Q. Are you especially concerned that Senator Alfonse D'Amato, if he becomes chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Representative Jim Leach, if he becomes chairman of the House Banking Committee, will now intensify their Whitewater investigations?
A. No, I have said I would cooperate with the Congress, and I will continue to cooperate with the Congress, as I have.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: VOTERS;
'It's Like a Call to Arms, Which the Democrats Will Ignore at Their Peril'

 BODY:

Howard Baker
Former Republican senator from Tennessee, who is now a lawyer in private practice.
This is unprecedented in my memory. It is important to point out that it was not just anti-incumbency, since not a single incumbent Republican in the House or Senate has been defeated. 
 But the country is in gentle rebellion, and I think it has been now for the last two or three election cycles. By that I mean the long-term rising of the anger. People are focusing their anger right now on a few specific things, but mostly they are just expressing their dissatisfaction with the existing order.
I don't know where they are going, and I don't think they know where, either. But what frightens me, is that if we do not address their feelings, they may develop a tendency to savage our institutions.
In effect, the country has given the Republicans a chance, and in two years they are going to be re-examining it. But for now, it is a time for exhilaration for the Republicans.
 
George S. McGovern
Former senator and Democratic Presidential candidate in 1972, who is now president of the Middle East Policy Council in Washington.
One of the basic problems is that while the people in the top 20 percent of the American public are benefiting from the growth in the economy -- from deficit reduction, the fairly stable growth rate, the stock market being steady, inflation steady -- for everyone else, 80 percent of the public, including the middle class, are not doing as well as they were a few years ago.
We are told the election is going to result in less government and reduced spending, except for the military, and in tougher stands on welfare, and so on. Even some tax reduction. But I don't think that addresses the problem that I have just described.
And my guess is that if that is the direction we go in, that the Republican time will come in a couple of years down the road.
 
Shelby Foote
Historian and novelist.
I hope it's not going back to the situation of Andrew Johnson -- you know they almost ended up impeaching him. I simply hope it doesn't happen. They were out to get him, and they damn near got him. I hope this attitude is not what their attitude was. It wasn't that they were different parties, although they were. The real problem is that the Congress was absolutely furious that they had crossed him -- they only missed him by one vote.
Of course, they [the Republicans] are going to have to accept some responsibility for what happens in the next two years -- especially if they try to balance the budget. They're going to have an awful lot of problems. Any plans I've heard don't include reducing the deficit. The best benefit I can find is that Clinton has learned something from it and that he will come back with a better approach, although it's going to be a lot more difficult than it was a short time back.
 
Doris Kearns Goodwin
Historian and author of "No Ordinary Time, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt."
It's like a call to arms, which the Democrats will ignore at their peril. The time has come for those who still believe, as most Democrats do, that the government has a positive role to play in the lives of the people to re-define what that role is, and to communicate that definition with a passion and a conviction that's equal to the kind of conviction that the Republicans seem to have evoked in their call for no government or less government or smaller government.
Somehow, the Republicans have captured that insurgent feeling against all politicians in general. And now it's their turn to try to prove that their solutions for the complex problems of America -- the balanced budget, lower taxes, somehow magically reducing the deficit, and welfare reform and harsher measures on crime -- will actually work.
 
Alan Brinkley
Professor of history at Columbia University.
The magnitude of it surprised me. I had a bad feeling about it, especially in the past week. I'm still trying to digest it myself. I think suddenly the Republicans have to deal with some problems. It's very different being the majority party. I'm certainly not prepared to say anything but that this is a triumph for the Republicans.
Now they'll start to be held accountable. If the mood in the nation is as angry and poisonous as it has appeared, the Republicans have a big job ahead. Politics is a process of trying to win power -- and they won it and that's the benefit.
The Republican Party in particular has not in recent years had much of a positive agenda. It seems to want power to prevent things from happening instead of to do things. The benefit for the Republicans is that nothing will happen in the next two years that they don't want to happen. It's hard to imagine that they're going to be able to transform government. But they've got all sorts of opportunities to produce embarrassments for the Clinton Administration.
 
Fred Greenstein
Historian at Princeton University.
I think this is a little bit like what doctors call iatrogenic -- medically induced illness. The attempts to diagnose the political system have contributed to the malaise. Crime rates are lower; the economy is not bad. But the word has been out and anyone who consumes the network news hears day after day what a terrible time people are having, how everyone is angry, how politicians are corrupt, and how incumbents are bad.
I think if you're a conservative, the new situation is good. If you believe in positive government, then not much is going to come out of this. It's possible there may be some paradoxes on things like health care where it will be in everyone's interest to put together some modest reform. But basically I think you can expect a period of statis and position-taking.
 
Julian Bond
Former Georgia legislator, who is now aprofessor of government at The American University in Washington and a professor of history at the University of Virginia.
It's the Democrats' inability, which is fairly longstanding, to promote their message in an aggressive way, and to set the agenda in an aggressive way. I think it's just an American discontent with some important issues, like crime and immigration, that have a slight, or more pronounced, depending on who you are, racial cast to them. The combination of all three of these things produced this staggering result.
We'll have a chance now to see whether they [the Republicans] can say yes to anything, instead of just saying no. And I think they are going to be subjected, I hope, to the same kind of intense negative scrutiny that the President and the Democrats have faced.
 
Pete Dexter
Author of "Deadwood" and "Paris Trout."
I think there's a general unease. I think that with Clinton, there's something there that people essentially don't trust, and I think for very good reason. I think this is a reaction to the personality, more than the direction the country's going or all that stuff about change. It comes from the very top of the Democratic party. I can't figure it any other way. You look at the candidates, some of the right people lost . . . Huffington, North. It wasn't just simply a mandate to get all Democrats out, though that seemed to be the theme of it. Where Republicans lost, in California and Virginia, is because of the people they ran, as opposed to the people running against them. When somebody was running who was perceived as slick or dishonest or distasteful, then that person was rejected, too.
What I woke up this morning thinking is that we would be seeing that much more Newt Gingrich, and I don't consider that a big plus. I think maybe the good part of it is it goes back and forth.
 
David Halberstam
Pulitzer Prize-winning author and journalist.
The country is in the midst of profound economic change. We're going from an essential blue-collar economy and relative easy affluence to a time where we're in a international economy and the blue-collar jobs are disappearing, and where in many homes there is more anxiety and more and more the middle class depends on education. These are changes that have been going on for decades, but the political consequences are just beginning to surface.
Also, there has always been a "they" in American politics, and for a long time the "they" were the communists. Even though the Cold War is over, the instinct to look for a "they" is still strong, but now it's switched from the communists to being someone here domestically like immigrants.
 
Michael J. Sandel
Professor of government at Harvard University.
This election was haunted by the fear that we are losing control of the forces that govern our lives, that the moral fabric of community is unraveling around us, and that our political institutions are unable to respond. The issues of crime, immigration and welfare stand for these larger fears.
The next two years are likely to deepen these frustrations. Democrats and Republicans will struggle to avoid being held responsible for the likely impasse, so as not to be the target of the next round of voter wrath. But if the deeper problems go unaddressed, and if disenchantment is compounded by economic downturn, darker scenarios become imaginable. There is the danger that the politics of protest may find its next expression in the "man on horseback," an authoritarian figure who offers a way beyond impasse, above politics, and beyond the messy, often frustrating restraints of constitutional government.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;
On Capitol Hill, a World Is Turned Upside Down

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
The Capitol was an eerie place today, quiet and void of its usual bustle and the famous faces who orchestrate it. They are home either nursing wounds or nurturing new-found importance.
Left behind were their staffs -- Capitol Hill's permanent denizens, who discovered today that some were more permanent than others, their fates largely contingent on the electoral fortunes of their patrons. 
 Already, the word is out: members of the House and Senate who lost elections on Tuesday must vacate their offices -- and dismiss their staffs -- by Dec. 15. Democrats who won re-election might be able to keep their same personal offices, but those who headed committees or subcommittees must turn over their grand chairmen's suites to their Republican successors.
Committee staff members are bracing for a wholesale layoff within their ranks. Not even Republican staff members are immune, not when their bosses promised an angry electorate that they would clamp down on the Government's payroll, including that of Congressional staff.
Compounding the situation, there are few places for newly unemployed Democratic staff members to go.
"There is a glut on the downtown market," said a senior Democratic staff employee, sitting in his large committee office. "The law firms, consultants, lobbying firms, the Administration -- the market is already over-bloated."
Moreover, Democratic staff members have lost an advantage intrinsic to working for the majority party. "If a Rostenkowski lost, there would be a new Democrat somewhere else who would value the skills you had developed as an aide to a prominent Democrat, and that gave you a certain marketability," said a leading Democratic House aide. "That's gone."
Another Democratic staff member pointed out: "Having experience with the Democratic Congress is not necessarily the most sterling, attractive credential you can have to sell yourself. What are you selling? Ties to the minority? Who cares? The firms downtown need Republicans who can call up Dole or Gingrich. It's a very bleak job market."
Bleak was also the pervasive mood among Democratic staff members. "People are definitely depressed," said Joel Lane, a 31-year-old legislative assistant for Representative Frank McCloskey, Democrat of Indiana, who lost his bid for re-election. "It's not something you get over overnight. You have to realize that this is the reality for the future."
Republicans seemed sobered by the magnitude of their new responsibility, or by the thought that unbridled glee could come back to haunt them. Haley Barbour, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said at a news conference this morning that his wife had cautioned him "not to gloat."
It is unclear just how drastic the cuts will be among the committee staffs. The House has about 2,250 employees on its 23 full committees; the Senate has about 1,700 on its 20 full and select committees.
Newt Gingrich, the Speaker-in-waiting, has talked about cutting the entire House committee staff by one-third. For Democrats, those cuts could be even more severe.
"You can't regulate major industries without staff," said a Democratic aide who seemed unaware that that was just what the Republicans had been promising.
In the past, the District of Columbia Government sent staff to the Hill to help newly unemployed workers file unemployment claims. Mike Heny, director of the House Finance Office, said he had heard rumors, which were not confirmed, that the District would again send such help and hold a seminar.
One person still wearing a smile was a member of the permanent Capitol Hill security force. "They come and go," he said. "And I'll still be here when the new ones leave."

HEADLINE: The Election's Fallout for the Economy;
Trade Vote Is First Test For Victors

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Newly victorious Republicans and a humbled Clinton Administration face their first big test even before the new Congress takes over in January, in a scheduled vote after Thanksgiving on whether to approve a long-delayed world trade pact.
Both parties say they support the 123-nation agreement hammered out under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is known as GATT and is considered to be one of the most important economic initiatives of the last decade. But the two sides still find themselves at odds as soon as they start discussing its details. 
 While GATT will set an international framework for American business, the immediate post-election fallout for the domestic marketplace will revolve around new personalities rather than radically new policies. That reflects the changes in the leadership of several key Congressional committees and the potential repercussions from a shift to a Republican-controlled legislature.
Picking the winners and losers is risky. In general, health care, telecommunications and heavy industry stand to benefit from a trend toward less regulation. But the military industry and banking may not gain as much. [Page D7.]
For business as a whole, the attention in the new Congress will focus on whether Washington faces two more years of gridlock or whether the White House can find compromises with Republicans on issues like taxation of capital gains and budget policy. But those issues will take months to settle, if not longer.
At issue immediately, however, is the GATT accord, which advocates say would raise United States exports by $20 billion by the end of the decade. The failure to approve the pact would undercut President Clinton's case that he is creating jobs in the United States by pressing free trade agreements in Asia and Latin America.
For weeks his Cabinet members have insisted -- especially to foreign governments that have delayed their own approval of the pact until Congress acted -- that passage was a sure thing. The objections, they have said, will fade away immediately after the elections.
Congress meets in a special session after Thanksgiving to consider GATT.
Today that confidence seemed a bit shaken. As Mr. Clinton prepared to leave for an economic summit meeting in Indonesia with Asian leaders, he appealed to the Republican Congress to put international affairs above politics and approve GATT, saying, "Our prosperity depends on it."
But doubts crept into the voices of Administration officials who fear the vote could get hung up in the Senate on a budget technicality and then be pushed over to the next and more conservative Congress.
"People are real nervous about it," one senior Administration official said.
Still, most officials argued the opposite publicly, saying that the expansion of GATT would be a chance for the new Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, and other Republicans to show that they are striving for bipartisanship, even if the mood does not last long.
"If we can have both the Democrats and the Republicans working together to get GATT passed, it could set, certainly, a better framework for the next session," Leon E. Panetta, President Clinton's chief of staff, said this afternoon. Mr. Dole discussed the issue with Mr. Clinton by telephone this morning.
But as Mr. Clinton's chief economic advisers were acknowledging even before the magnitude of the Democratic loss was known, their ability to press for additional economic initiatives beyond the trade accord -- from more deficit reduction to new jobs programs -- will be severely limited.
"We've got to recalculate the agenda," Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown said several days ago. "There is a lot of implementing of existing programs that is within our grasp, a lot you can do from the executive branch. But you have to pare down expectations on new activities."
Mr. Clinton implicitly acknowledged during a news conference this afternoon that outside of efforts to promote jobs through international trade, his economic options were constrained. As an economic tool, fiscal policy is nearly dead. So many areas of the national budget have been declared untouchable that there is little money left to affect the economy, except around the edges.
For example, while both parties are talking about tax cuts, both sides have steered clear of the kind of spending cuts that would pay for them. The Republicans probably will press for new economic estimates to support their supply-side arguments that tax cuts would eventually produce new revenue and thus pay for themselves.
The first step in obtaining those estimates, Republicans said today, would probably include replacing the head of the Congressional budget office, Robert D. Reischauer, with an economist more likely to provide the Republicans with the kind of statistics they want to see. Mr. Reischauer's term expires in January.
For his part, Mr. Clinton said today that he was committed to continued cuts in the national deficit, the one move that brought the bond markets to his side.
"I do not believe that we can afford to go back to the days of exploding deficits," Mr. Clinton said at a news conference this afternoon. Even the trade agreement has a budget implication, and that may be the complication that trips up its passage.
The key to the legislation is the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers worldwide. That will largely benefit American exporters, because foreign nations, by and large, have far higher tariffs than does the United States.
But the loss of tariff revenue will cost roughly $11 billion during the next five years. While passage seems assured in the House -- where the future Speaker, Newt Gingrich, has already voiced his support -- Senate rules call for passage by at least 60 votes if the bill will reduce revenues during the next 10 years.
By the White House's count, there are at least 50 votes for GATT, but perhaps not 60. The budget issue could provide cover for those who object to other provisions of the bill, a category that includes consumer advocates like Ralph Nader, labor unions like the International Union of Electrical Workers and small businesses that fear competition from overseas multinationals.

HEADLINE: America Online Buys 2 Internet Companies

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
America Online Inc., facing a challenge from the Microsoft Corporation in the market for on-line computer services, said yesterday that it had acquired two small Internet service companies for a total of more than $34 million in stock.
The companies acquired by America Online, Navisoft Inc. and Booklink Technologies Inc., would become the core of America Online's recently formed Internet Services Company. The companies, which are start-ups that have generated no revenue to date, make software that allow businesses and consumers to more easily use the Internet, especially the rapidly growing area known as the World Wide Web. 
 Some of the software would be incorporated into America Online's own consumer software, allowing the company's 1.2 million on-line services customers to gain access to the World Wide Web, which is increasingly being used by businesses to market goods and services to computer users.
The acquired software would also be used as a cornerstone for a new on-line service that would focus on business applications for the Internet.
"It's a brilliant move on A.O.L.'s part," said Mary Modahl, senior analyst at Forrester research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. "Consumers are not going to buy more than one information service. They will go to the place that has the widest door to what's available in the on-line universe. By adding Web access, America Online will have the widest open door."
"It's an aggressive move to counter what A.O.L. sees as a looming threat from Microsoft and is clearly timed to blunt the impact of Microsoft's announcement of Marvel next week," said Adam Schoenfeld, news director of Jupiter Research Inc. of New York. Marvel is the code name for the rival on-line information service that Microsoft is planning to introduce next year along with its next generation of the Windows operating system.
America Online's stock has been pummeled in the last two days, losing about 10 percent of its value, in reaction to investor fears about the competitive impact of Microsoft's Marvel. Yesterday, America Online's shares dropped $3, to $63.25, in Nasdaq trading. On Tuesday, the shares fell $6.75.
In acquiring Booklink Technologies of Wilmington, Mass., for $30 million in stock, America Online would gain control of prototype software called Internetworks, which is scheduled to be formally introduced next week at the Comdex computer trade show in Las Vegas.
Advance copies of Internetworks have been praised by some testers as superior to existing programs for browsing the World Wide Web, including Mosaic and its variations. Besides Web access, the software includes a full range of Internet services, including access to electronic mail, discussion groups and a variety of file searching and transfer tools. It is said to work especially well with the common computer modems and telephone lines used by consumers.
Booklinks is a wholly owned subsidiary of CMG Information Services.
In the second facet of the deal, America Online would acquire Navisoft for 65,000 shares of stock, which at current levels would be valued at slightly more than $4 million. Navisoft's president, David C. Cole, a venture capitalist who was formerly president of the Ashton-Tate Company and Ziff Communications, is to become president of America Online's Internet Services Company, the company said.

HEADLINE: Fewest U.S. Farms Since 1850: 1.9 Million

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Continuing a trend that began six decades ago, the number of American farms has dipped below two million for the first time since before the Civil War, the Census Bureau said today.
The bureau, which produces a farm census every five years, counted 1,925,300 farms in the United States in 1992, the lowest number since 1850. The decline has been steady since 1935, when the total number of farms peaked at 6.8 million as the Depression began the migration off the land and into the cities. 
 The number of farms continues to shrink despite Thomas Jefferson's view that "the small landowners are the most precious part of society." But at the same time farms are also ever more efficient and productive.
The Census Bureau defines a farm as any entity that produces or has the ability to produce $1,000 a year worth of agricultural products, like beef, hogs, poultry, grains, fruits or vegetables.
Rural demographers say such a liberal definition of what constitutes a farm may overstate the number of working farms. When only working farms are considered, experts in the agricultural economy say the abiding long-term trend has led to increase consolidation of agricultural holdings into fewer and fewer hands.
The bureau reported that while the number of farms and the amount of farm acerage dropped between 1987 and 1992, crop sales rose by 28 percent. There are fewer farms, said Jorge Garcia-Pratts, an agricultural statistician at the Census Bureau, "but they are producing much more."
Along with continued increases in agricultural productivity, the new study highlighted sweeping structural changes in the rural landscape.
For example, the report noted, total farm acreage declined to 282 million acres in 1992 from 296 million acres five years before. Agricultural experts say the decrease reflects, in part, the increasing amounts of rural land being taken for residential or recreational purposes as people continue to flee cities and suburbs close to cities.
"Crop land in the U.S. in areas that have subtropical winters -- the Florida peninsula, the lower Rio Grande Valley, Southern California -- all of those areas are having very rapid population growth, almost runaway population growth," said Calvin Beale, senior demographer at the Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service.
The report said cotton production was shifting from semi-arid areas of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas back to its historic home in the Mississippi Delta and other Southeastern states. In part, experts say, this shift is caused by the diversion of water from agricultural uses to residential and recreational ones in the West and Southwest.
Despite these pressures, and even though farmers continue to operate on thin profit margins, experts say, they have rebounded strongly from the dire financial conditions of the mid-1980's, when their debt soared, commodity surpluses increased, prices plummeted and the number of foreclosures reached their highest level since the Depression.
"General economic indicators are much better," said Keith Collins, chief economist at the Department of Agriculture. "The number of farms that are vulnerable to bankruptcy is much lower; the debt-to-asset ratio of agriculture as a whole is much improved; farmers debt levels are down substantially, and their assets have gone up, particularly land."
One sign of improved financial security on farms is the decrease in the number of acres placed in Federal commodity programs, which pay farmers to leave cropland fallow. In 1992, farmers placed 7 million acres in these programs, down nearly 84 percent from the 43 million acres left idle in 1987.
But if farmers are more prosperous, the consolidation of cropland into fewer and fewer farms has meant that fewer and fewer people are entering into the profession.
The report indicated that the average age of farm operators increased to 53.3 years in 1992, from 52 years in 1987. Mr. Beale, the Department of Agriculture demographer, said that trend was a result of the declining birth rate among farm families and the economic upheavals of the 1980's.
"It's the combination of a smaller supply of younger adults to draw from and from many of them being disillusioned with making a financial success out of farming, given the problems they grew up with in the 1980's."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: NEW YORK STATE
GIULIANI;
His Man Unhorsed, Giuliani Confronts His Political Plight

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
Having gambled and lost in his dramatic endorsement of Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has now been left needing millions of dollars of assistance from the state but facing a Republican governor who owes him nothing and drew little of his support from New York City.
In a sign of his political plight, the Mayor admitted yesterday that he had twice called Governor-elect George E. Pataki since his victory, but had not heard back. 
 Just four days after he assailed Mr. Pataki and his patron, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, by saying that "if the D'Amato-Pataki crew ever get control, ethics will be trashed," Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that he wanted the Governor-elect to know that "I want him to succeed" and "want him to be as successful a governor as he can be because it will help the city of New York."
At a news conference at City Hall, he expressed confidence that his fierce battle against Mr. Pataki's election would not affect how his fellow Republican dealt with the city, though he seemed more tentative about what the political repurcussions would be for him personally, as members of his party vowed vengeance.
"I don't see any future for him in his own party," said Borough President Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island, once one of Mr. Giuliani's closest allies and now an implaccable foe. "The only thing that makes sense is that he becomes a Democrat."
In City Hall, it was the first day of a new relationship between a Republican Mayor and a Republican Governor that many other political officials predicted could be as stormy as the notorious feud between Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and Mayor John V. Lindsay. But while his aides appeared exhausted and glum, Mr. Giuliani acted like a man at peace with himself, saying he would not have changed his decision to endorse Mr. Cuomo.
He even showing flashes of galllows humor. Asked if he expected to be hatcheted in the back by his fellow Republicans, Mr. Giuliani, who was standing alone at a lectern, laughed and said: "That's a very comforting thought. I do notice there's no one standing up here with me."
Mr. Giuliani said the responsibilities of being Governor would cause "any good and decent person -- and George Pataki is that -- to understand that you have to work together -- and he does understand that -- and whatever political consequences there are -- are things that we can only speculate about."
At a separate news conference, Mr. Pataki said he would not take retribution on the city, which is the economic engine of the state. "I have pointed out time and again, first that I love this city," he said, "second that I understand how important this city is to the entire state, and third that I am going to be Governor for all the people of this state."
But many Republicans noted that there were ways for Mr. Pataki, Mr. D'Amato and the Republican leaders now controlling Congress to make sure that Mr. Giuliani never gets to share in any of the political credit for any grants or projects or benefits they steer to New York City. One senior Republican leader said of Mr. Pataki: "He's going to make sure the city gets its fair share, but that doesn't mean he won't take it out on Giuliani personally."
The official, who asked not to be identified, also said that what Mr. Pataki considers a fair share may not coincide with Mr. Giuliani's idea of what is fair. Mr. Pataki said yesterday that his pledge to cut taxes and spending would be the cornerstone of his administration and that he would not back away from his pledge to cut state income taxes by 25 percent over four years.
But the Governor-elect indicated that he was willing to look at proposals Mr. Giuliani made in his latest plan to close a $1.1 billion budget gap that call for the state to continue paying its share of programs financed jointly by the city and the state -- even as the city cuts its share. And while not embracing the takeover of local Medicaid costs that could solve the city's structural deficit, Mr. Pataki said he would be seeking to achieve cost containment in Medicaid spending and to find ways to reduce welfare costs.
One Giuliani aide said the true test of what Mr. Pataki's election would mean for New York City's already precarious finances would come when he submits his first budget next year. The official, who requested anonymity, said that if the Republican Governor moves forward with the first phase of his tax cut plan, it could mean across-the-board reductions in assistance to localities in everything from mass-transit aid to funds for education.
Mr. Giuliani, meanwhile, moved to shore up other alliances. He spoke to H. Carl McCall, the Demcratic State Comptroller he had opposed during the campaign as overly political, and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who has often been hostile to Mr. Giuliani's initiatives. He praised both Democrats as officials who "understand the interests of the city." Mr. Giuliani also congratulated Dennis C. Vacco, the Republican elected as state attorney general.
Jay Severin , a New York-based Republican political consultant, said that in 1997 Mr. Giuliani could face both a nuisance Republican primary and a Conservative Party challenger who could wound him in a three-way race by drawing large numbers of Italian-American and Jewish voters from Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island.
On the other side of the aisle, Herman Badillo, a Democratic ally of Mr. Giuliani, said the Mayor had helped Mr. Cuomo draw a huge margin of support in the city and remained highly popular in the 5-to-1 Democratic city. And former Mayor Edward I. Koch called for Democrats to give Mr. Giuliani their own ballot line when he seeks re-election.
Mr. Giuliani said simply that the political ramifications of the election would play out over two or three years. "American politics changes so quickly now," he said, "I think all of us would be foolish to try to assume what's going to happen."

GOVERNOR;
Now Comes the Hardest Part: Repealing That Hateful Tax

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 9

 BODY:
On the morning after the Republican John G. Rowland was elected governor with 36 percent of the vote, he began the difficult job of broadening support for his plan to eliminate the income tax, reaching out to Democrats and independents and describing his victory as a message about the public's feelings concerning government.
"It's a mood," he said. "I think people of this country, let alone this state, want someone who will reverse the trends of the Great Society that has been around for the last 30 years." 
 But in a response being heard today in New York, Washington and beyond, the Democratic opposition here, while conciliatory, indicated it did not intend to go away quietly.
Though Republicans now control the Governor's mansion and have a majority in the Senate, the Democrats still control the House of Representatives, and Thomas D. Ritter, the House Speaker, had a few barbs for the Governor-elect. When reporters asked Mr. Ritter about repealing the income tax, he needled Mr. Rowland, saying, "Is he still for it?" And added, "Without drawing lines in the sand, I think our priority is property tax relief."
In a four-way race that splintered the electorate, Mr. Rowland made sweeping promises to cut spending and repeal the three-year-old income tax, which raises roughly one-fourth of the state's revenues.
And he takes office with a potentially fractious legislature. While the Republicans gained at least one seat in the State Senate and now command a majority, Democrats picked up at least four seats in the House of Representatives, increasing an already substantial majority.
This sets the stage for a volatile showdown in the Legislature, and by bringing the income tax back to center stage, Mr. Rowland may reopen a Pandora's Box that in 1991 provoked one of the most heated political battles in recent state history.
Still, both Mr. Rowland and Mr. Ritter said they preferred to focus on the potential for cooperation between the two parties.
Mr. Rowland said that as a member of the Legislature and Congress in the 1980's, he had a reputation of being able to work with people "on both sides of the aisle," a point that many Democrats confirm. And Mr. Ritter said that he had worked well with Mr. Rowland years ago, and said, "I'm going to be a lot nicer to John Rowland than Newt Gingrich will be to President Clinton."
Mr. Ritter pointed to the gains Democrats made in the Connecticut House.
"In the little world we live in here, we're very pleased that we picked up four or five seats," he said, adding, "We're elated about the message that voters sent to House Democrats. I'll bet you that this was one of the biggest pickups of seats of any in the country."
The political obstacles are only part of the problem Mr. Rowland faces.
The income tax this year provided $2.6 billion of the state's $9.5 billion budget. Mr. Rowland has promised to cut the 4.5 percent tax by 1 percent in 1995 and another half-percent in 1996, and then phase it out entirely over the next three years without raising any other taxes.
One of the first problems he will face is how to cut the state budget in 1995 to achieve his first goal. According to figures from the Office of Fiscal Analyis, a nonpartisan state legislative agency, the state will have a budget deficit of $430 million in 1995 that will require cuts before any reductions above and beyond that can be applied to the income tax.
And Mr. Rowland's plan has not detailed where he would find the savings for about two-thirds of the needed cuts to implement his income tax plan. In the campaign, he said that over five years, half of the $2.6 billion in lost annual revenue from the income tax would be offset by reductions in the state budget, with the other half coming from increased economic activity that would spur revenues from other taxes.
While Mr. Rowland outlined $400 million in savings, achieved in part through reorganization of state agencies and reductions in borrowing and state employee overtime, he has yet to specify how he will make another $900 million in cuts.
Harry Harris, vice president of the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association, a business organization in Fairfield County that supported the income tax in 1991, said today, "There's a great deal of doubt whether it's possible." And he added that the group's board would be meeting Wednesday to discuss whether such a plan is even desirable.
Still, Mr. Rowland was confident today that he would have the political support to get the job done. Supporters say that the 36 percent of the vote he received Tuesday was substantial, given the four-way race. They noted that Tom Scott, an independent candidate who was a leader of the anti-income tax movement, received 11 percent of the vote, and said that much of Mr. Scott's support came at Mr. Rowland's expense.
Jonathan Pelto, the former political director of the Democratic Party, said, "Had Tom Scott not been in the race, it would have been a landslide victory for Rowland."
Mr. Rowland was upbeat about his future with the legislature. He noted that he announced his candidacy from the floor of the House earlier this year, and that his campaign pointedly avoided attacking its members.
Mr. Rowland's bipartisan efforts will be aided by his Lieutenant Governor, Jodi Rell, a 10-year veteran of the legislature, who is well respected by Democrats, and there has been a history of Republicans forming coalitions with moderate Democrats in the House.
"I think they're going to look forward to working with us," Mr. Rowland said.
Mr. Ritter seemed open to the idea, saying that both sides needed to be prepared to compromise.
Asked whether he could consider repealing the income tax, he said: "It will be a mutual discussion and if we end up somewhere in the middle, that's fine. I guess we're all going to start an interesting few years."

HEADLINE: Regulators Get Leeway In Bank Takeover Rule

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

 BODY:
Worried that a new accounting rule might make crises in the financial market worse, Federal bank regulators announced a narrow exception yesterday aimed at preventing unintended Federal takeovers of commercial banks.
The new rule, Financial Accounting Standard 115, will soon force banks to show the current market value of securities on their books, rather than the price at which they acquired the securities. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is part of the Treasury Department, announced yesterday that banks would be required to follow the rule except in determining whether they retained enough capital to cover possible losses on loans and other investments. 
 The exception is important because banks and regulators had worried that a sudden plunge in financial markets could send a bank's capital below regulatory minimums. Five-year-old legislation requires the Federal Government to move quickly to take over banks and savings institutions that fall below these minimums.
Congress passed the law in response to the collapse of the savings and loan industry, in which many undercapitalized institutions stayed open for years while toting up billions of dollars in losses that taxpayers eventually covered. In recent months, bankers and Federal regulators began to worry that a dip in the market could provoke costly Federal takeovers before markets recovered or before the stricken institutions could raise new capital, such as through a sale of stock.
Most Federal banking laws require that regulators follow generally accepted accounting practices, which now include Financial Accounting Standard 115. But the five-year-old law on Federal takeovers does not explicitly require that generally accepted practices be followed, giving Federal regulators the leeway to make an exception, the Comptroller's office said.
"Under current law, incorporating F.A.S. 115 into risk-based capital could have forced bank regulators to intervene unnecessarily when temporary changes in market interest rates reduced risk-based capital below regulatory minimums," Eugene A. Ludwig, the Comptroller of the Currency, said in the statement.
A regulator who insisted on anonymity said that other bank and savings regulatory agencies were likely to make the same exception in the coming months.
The banking industry welcomed the Comptroller's decision. Without the exception, regulators would have lost their flexibility in deciding when to take over an institution, said Edward Yingling, the chief lobbyist of the American Bankers Association.
"This would have, in effect, put you on an automatic pilot for regulatory purposes," he said.

HEADLINE: AT&T Gets Mexico Partner For Long-Distance Service

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Making its bid for one of the biggest prizes in the Mexican economy, the AT&T Corporation announced a $1 billion alliance today with a Mexican partner, Grupo Industrial Alfa S.A., that would provide long-distance telephone service when the present Government-approved monopoly ends in 1997.
Analysts had expected AT&T to decide to enter the expanding Mexican market, but were surprised by its selection of Alfa, an industrial group that manufactures diverse products ranging from cold-cut meats to flat steel, but has no telephone experience. 
 AT&T had been expected to choose Telefonos de Mexico, the privately run national telephone company known as Telmex.
Victor A. Pelson, executive vice president of AT&T and chairman of its global operations team, explained that negotiations with Telmex were broken off because of concern about possible regulatory problems in the United States.
The Southwestern Bell Corporation bought 10 percent of Telmex when the company was privatized in 1990. But the Federal Communications Commission bars regional phone companies in the United States from entering the long-distance market. Mr. Pelson said that because of Southwestern Bell's involvement, the F.C.C. could prohibit Telmex from providing long-distance service into the United States.
"Traffic between Mexico and the United States, that was the issue," he said.
The MCI Communications Corporation and the Sprint Corporation have also joined Mexican partners to vie for one of the treasured long-distance concessions to be granted by the Government. The GTE Corporation and Motorola Inc. have also expressed interest. But none of these would bring to the table the combination of AT&T's technological advantages and the financial resources of Alfa, which had sales in 1993 of $2.5 billion and has strategic alliances with 15 other multinational companies, including Ford Motor, Du Pont and Oscar Meyer, a unit of Philip Morris.
"Let's face it," said Jack Grubman, a telecommunications analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York. "When you take a company like AT&T, which is clearly the world's most powerful telecommunications entity with the world's most sophisticated technology, and combine it with a company like Alfa, with all its considerable financial assets, and you make it the new kid on block -- it's scary."
The exclusion of Telmex did not seem to have hurt its stock much today. Telmex shares dropped about 1 percent in Mexico and its American depository receipts closed at $56 on the New York Stock Exchange, down $1.
At a news conference here today, officials of both AT&T and Alfa said that over the next four to six years, they were prepared to invest $1 billion to create a network that would compete with Telmex in long-distance service. Alfa would own 51 percent of the new venture, and AT&T the remaining 49 percent.
Long-distance service in Mexico is seen as a lucrative market with great potential for growth as the Mexican economy expands under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Personal phone services are also expected to grow as more Mexicans can afford telephones. Mexico now has 8 lines for each 100 inhabitants, AT&T said, compared with 55 lines in the United States. AT&T said the number of lines in Mexico could triple by 2000.
Mexican regulators have not yet set out all the criteria for selecting long-distance competitors. But analysts say the Government could effectively control the number of companies by demanding a high level of technological expertise or what would become a multibillion-dollar entrance fee.
Such prospects have not deterred AT&T officials. "I can't imagine that any entrance requirements would be too restrictive for us to enter the market," Mr. Pelson of AT&T said.
The chief executive officer of Alfa, Dionisio Garza Medina, said he expected the Government to select the winning long-distance bidders by the end of the first quarter of 1995. He said Alfa had planned to bid for the Telmex concession when the company was privatized in 1990, but decided instead to revamp its own basic businesses.
Three years and more than $1.5 billion later, Mr. Garza Medina said, his company is looking for investments in long-term, high-growth sectors like telecommunications.
Berge Ayvazian, a telecommunications industry analyst at the Yankee Group, a market research firm in Boston, said the Alfa-AT&T alliance showed new boldness on the part of the American company, which is trying to become a force in the telecommunications markets in several other developing countries.
"This is just the first shoe that you'll see dropped regarding the rest of Latin America," Mr. Ayvazian said.


GRAPHIC: Though Alfa is far from a household name in the United States, it is one of Mexico's largest industrial corporations, with 22,500 employees and $2.49 billion in sales in 1993. Its ambitions and clout in its home market can be discerned in the alliances its four business groups have forged with leading foreigh companies.

Bonds Gain Despite Rate Threat

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were higher yesterday for the second consecutive session on a stronger dollar and optimism that Republican gains would help the fixed-income market.
Prices of United States securities started rising overnight as European investors interpreted the election results to mean that Republicans would provide a more favorable environment for the financial markets. 
 But the election results are not likely to prevent the Federal Reserve from raising short-term interest rates next Tuesday, when the Fed's policy-making group, the Federal Open market Committee, meets, traders said.
In New York, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond settled up 5/32 , to 932/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 8.11 percent from 8.12 percent on Tuesday.
"The bond market itself was firm all day," said Charles Roden, managing director and head of fixed-income investing for Josephthal, Lyon & Ross. "And I believe we've reached a point in interest rates where the the shorter maturities are attractive enough to draw portfolio managers out to buy longer maturities."
An auction of 10-year notes was well received yesterday but it failed to push the market higher. The sale lacked the strong demand seen in Tuesday's auction of three-year notes. The $12 billion auction of 10-year notes drew an average yield of 7.96 percent, just above the 7.955 percent traders expected. The yield suggested that investors wanted to be compensated more for buying these securities in a bear market, so dealers repriced them a little cheaper.
The only major economic report yesterday had little impact on the bond market. The Labor Department reported that third-quarter nonfarm productivity rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the third quarter. The figure showed a larger-than-expected rebound after a revised 2.1 percent decline in the second quarter. Labor costs rose just one-tenth of 1 percent in the latest quarter, which was mildly positive news for the bond market.
Ahead of the auction there was a little nervousness at the prospect of selling a 10-year note with a return below 8 percent. The when-issued yield rallied to 7.93 percent in London and had only backed off 7.95 percent in early trading here, still well below the 8.05 percent yield earlier this week.
New York City priced $703 million of tax-exempt general obligation bonds yesterday through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch. And in an unusual move, underwriters were given approval by the city to extended the pre-marketing retail order period.
It allowed the underwriters to first tap the retail sector and than approach institutional investors having sold over $300 million of the financing. With a good portion sold, institutionals felt comfortable in bidding more aggressively.
Bonds due in 1996 through 2005 -- representing the short end -- drew very good retail demand, while the middle maturities saw good institutional demand and the longer maturities saw good demand from both.
Underwriters priced the issue to yield from 7.10 percent for a bond due in 2006 to 7.45 percent for one with a maturity date of 2011. The longer-term bonds were offered with a maximum yield of 7.55 percent for a bond due in 2020, while another due in 2016 was priced to yield 7.52 percent and another due in 2013 was priced to yield 7.48 percent.
The issue is rated Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service and A- by Standard & Poor's and Fitch Investors Service.
The following are the results of yesterday's 10-year note auction:

Average Price . . . 99.421

HEADLINE: Productivity In Business Shows Rise

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Business productivity rose in the third quarter as American workers put in long hours and labor costs held steady, Labor Department figures showed today.
Nonfarm productivity increased 2.7 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter after falling by 2.1 percent during the second quarter, the first decline since the first quarter of 1993. 
 "Good productivity growth is going to help keep down labor costs, and any acceleration in inflation will be modest," said Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Money Watch in New York.
The Labor Department's report measures the time, effort and cost of producing goods and services. Higher productivity suggests businesses are being efficient and keeping costs under control.
Labor costs, which make up more than half of production costs, increased just one-tenth of 1 percent in the third quarter while the implicit price deflator, a measure of inflation, rose a modest 1.9 percent.
Still, workers who have managed to hang onto their jobs as companies curtailed operations have been pushed to work longer hours without major pay increases. Hourly compensation, adjusted for inflation, fell seven-tenths of 1 percent in the third quarter after dropping 2 percent in the second quarter. It was the fifth decrease in seven quarters.
The strains from longer workweeks are already starting to show. Earlier this week, for example, General Motors workers at a Janesville, Wis., truck plant voted to strike unless more workers were hired. Similar complaints earlier this year led to a brief strike at a G.M. plant in Flint, Mich.
Today's report also showed that manufacturing productivity climbed 5.3 percent during the third quarter after rising 5.7 percent in the second quarter.
By category, unit labor costs for nonfarm businesses edged up one-tenth of 1 percent in the third quarter after increasing 2.9 percent during the second quarter.
The number of hours worked increased by 1.2 percent in the third quarter -- the 10th consecutive increase -- after rising by 5.5 percent in the second quarter. "We're seeing record levels of overtime in manufacturing," said Norm Williams, an economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles.

Silver Prices Fall Sharply On Fear of Interest Rate Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Silver prices fell sharply yesterday as investors eyed a strengthening dollar and the possibility of an interest rate increase next week.
Declines in energy and wheat prices helped drag the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities down 0.76 point, to 233.21. 
 On the Commodity Exchange of New York, silver for December delivery fell 10.7 cents, to $5.118 an ounce, a level not seen since the metal traded at $5.10 on Aug. 16. The December gold contract slipped 30 cents, to $384.50 an ounce.
Precious metals have been hampered in recent days by uncertainty over just how far the Federal Reserve Board may go next week in trying to curb inflation. Some analysts predict interest rates will be increased half a percentage point.
Investors have historically bought precious metals to hedge against inflation because those metals tend to hold their value better than other investments. An interest rate increase at a time of relatively low inflation could send investors elsewhere.
"A rate hike is the No. 1 public enemy for a lot of the markets, particularly precious metals," said Peter Cardillo, director of research for Westfalia Investments Inc. in New York. "It put a lot of markets in technical trouble despite high physical demand."
Gasoline led a slide in energy prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that gasoline stocks rose 4.327 million barrels last week, while Energy Department figures showed stocks rose 3.1 million barrels.
Investors had believed stockpiles in the United States were low following the rupture and shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline system in Texas.
December unleaded gasoline fell 1.65 cents, to 56.45 cents a gallon. December crude oil fell 42 cents, to $18.16 a barrel.
Wheat futures fell to a two-month low on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid a Government estimate that China, as well as Russia and other former Soviet republics, may not buy as much.
The Agriculture Department said yesterday that it expected China to import only 9 million tons of wheat this year, down from the the agency's previous estimate of 10 million tons. Russia, another major wheat buying country, is expected to import 4 million tons, down from 4.5 million.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Putting a price tag on life, and regulation that protects it.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
HOW much is a life worth? Merely posing the question offends most people.
But answer it they must and answer it they do, says Kip Viscusi, an economist at Duke University. Every time the Government decrees a cleanup strategy for a toxic-waste dump or spends Medicaid dollars on kidney dialysis it is making implicit decisions about the dollars-and-cents value of life. The hard part, Mr. Viscusi suggests, is facing up to it. 
 That hard part may be about to get a little easier, however, thanks to the seemingly obvious but long-ignored idea that life-protecting expenditures can put other lives at risk. "It could prove to be the political breakthrough," says Robert Hahn, of the American Enterprise Institute.
Civil courts have traditionally valued life by earnings lost. When juries did not like the implied figure -- surgeons are more valuable than saints -- they threw in extra cash for "pain and suffering."
To economists, that misses the point: life is worth what people are willing to pay to stay alive, not what others are willing to pay them to toil from 9 to 5. The only test anchored in reality is one in which people implicitly value their own lives by taking avoidable, life-threatening risks in return for more income.
Dozens of such calculations have been published, most of them derived from measuring the extra pay demanded by workers in dangerous jobs. Some have looked at consumer choices, measuring how much people were willing to pay for smoke detectors, safer cars and the like.
The results, alas, are all over the lot. In part, presumably, that's because individuals sort themselves according to their tolerance for risk: Those who join the Green Berets are different from those who fight their wars in offices. In part, it may simply follow from individuals' mis-estimate of the actual risks.
But virtually none of the studies put the value of life above $10 million, a figure Mr. Viscusi believes ought to be an upper bound on what Government spends -- or demands that consumers or workers spend to save lives.
Many regulations pass the test easily. Rules on unvented space heaters save lives for just $130,000 each; regulations on emergency floor lighting on commercial aircraft checks in at $900,000 per life saved. Many, however, do not. Asbestos-removal standards, regulations on the storage of benzene and limits on arsenic in glass-making all top $100 million per life saved.
The bean counters in the Carter and Reagan Administrations asked regulators to justify new standards in cost-benefit terms. But the Bush Administration and now the Clinton Administration did not press the point.
As a result Mr. Viscusi thinks a few agencies -- notably the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration -- are implicitly undervaluing life. Others, notably the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, hardly bother with the costs.
But Mr. Viscusi thinks there is a back door to common sense even for those unwilling to balance costs against benefits. Virtually every economic activity is dangerous, he notes. More lives may be lost, for example, by trucking soil away from toxic-waste dumps than could be gained by reducing already low exposure to carcinogens. Simply demanding that agencies net out losses from benefits would put a lid on excesses.
More important, perhaps, it has been noted that
on average richer people live longer. In 1984, the Joint Economic Committee of Congress estimated that the 3 percent drop in income during the 1973 recession increased mortality rates by 2.3 percent. And just last year Randall Lutter and John Morall, economists working for the White House budget office, used cross-country data from the World Bank to estimate that a $9 million decrease in income leads to one premature death.
The implication -- that very expensive health and safety regulations can kill more people than they save because income available for other purposes is reduced -- is probably a bridge too far for gung-ho environmentalists in the Clinton Administration. But John Graham, the director of Harvard's Center for Risk Analysis, believes "Congress is definitely receptive" to the idea that Federal agencies should examine "the risks they create as well as the risks they conquer."
What's more, Jonathan Weiner of the Duke University School of Law thinks the Federal courts may use this concept of "income mediated" net benefits as a brake on regulatory excess. There is a "fairly short connection," he argues, between the idea of looking at overall health and safety impacts and the regulators' legal obligations under the Administration Procedures Act.
Washington, apparently, is not about to jump headlong into the controversy of valuing life. But it may yet creep where it is loath to leap.

Once one of the most powerful lawmakers in Congress, Representative Dan Rostenkowski was soundly defeated by a relative unknown, Michael P. Flanagan. Mr. Rostenkowski, an 18-term Chicago Democrat, was forced to relinquish the chairmanship of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee earlier this year after his indictment on corruption charges. Nonetheless, his defeat on Tuesday was considered a huge upset in the ward politics of Chicago, which in earlier times did not find indictments particularly troublesome.
As expected, Gov. Jim Edgar won a second term, trouncing his Democratic challenger, Dawn Clark Netsch.
In other Congressional races, one other Republican managed to win a seat that had been in Democratic hands. The district in Joliet that has been held by Representative George E. Sangmeister, a Democrat who is retiring, was won by State Representative Gerald C. Weller, a Republican. 
 Representative Mel Reynolds, a Democrat who was indicted this year on charges of statutory rape, child pornography and obstruction of justice, was unopposed and retained his seat.

Senator Richard G. Lugar swept to a fourth term with more than twice as many votes as his Democratic opponent, former Representative Jim Jontz. Mr. Jontz, who served in the House from 1986 to 1992 and was a leading force there for the protection of the timber owl and the Pacific Northwest forests, tried to build anti-incumbent sentiment, but could not dent the Senator's popularity.
David M. McIntosh, a Republican who was once on Dan Quayle's staff, won Muncie's Second District, opened by the retirement of Representative Phil Sharp, a Democrat. In the Fifth District, Representative Steve Buyer, a freshman Republican, held off a challenge from John D. Beatty.

Although Gov. Terry E. Branstad, a Republican, had trouble in the primary, he went on to become only the second governor in history to win four four-year terms in his state. Nelson Rockefeller in New York was the first. Mr. Branstad, who barely edged out Representative Fred Grandy, a more moderate Republican, in the primary, easily swept past his Democratic opponent, Attorney General Bonnie Campbell, by 15 percentage points.
The election also gave Iowa an all-Republican House delegation. The only Democratic House incumbent, Neal Smith, lost his seat to Greg Ganske. Representatives Jim Ross Lightfoot, Jim Leach and Jim Nussle all fended off Democratic challengers. And Mr. Grandy's district went to the Republican candidate, Tom Latham.
 
 GOVERNOR, 100% reporting
 Branstad, 562,918, 57%
 Campbell, 411,495, 42%
 
KANSAS
By seizing the governorship and the House seats of two veteran Democrats, Kansas Republicans will hold every post from the Topeka Statehouse to a six-member Congressional delegation led by Bob Dole, restored as Senate majority leader.
In the race for governor, Bill Graves, the Kansas Secretary of State, handily beat Jim Slattery, a six-term House veteran who not only lost his bid but also saw his seat fall to the Republicans as Sam Brownback trampled former Gov. John Carlin.
But the major surprise was that Wichita-area voters completed the Republican sweep, choosing Todd Tiahrt over the redoubtable Dan Glickman, a nine-term Congressman who had risen to be chairman of the Intelligence Committee. But Kansas will still have Representatives Pat Roberts and Jan Meyers heading committees on agriculture and small business.
 
 GOVERNOR, 100% reporting
 Graves, 524,624, 64%
 Slattery, 294,516, 36%
 
MICHIGAN
With the retirement of Senator Donald W. Riegle, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, the race for his replacement was considered an important barometer of which party would control the Midwest and the Senate.
So it was no surprise in light of the other Election Day results that the new Senator from Michigan will be Spencer Abraham, a former Republican state chairman and aide to Dan Quayle.
Mr. Abraham, who defeated Representative Bob Carr, received considerable support by being on the same line as John Engler, the popular Republican Governor who prevailed over former Representative Howard Wolpe. Early on, Mr. Engler seized the campaign after fulfilling promises to reduce taxes and change the way that public education was financed. He was also aided by a state economy on the rebound.
Republicans picked up one House district, the Eighth in Lansing, which had been held by Mr. Carr. It was won by Dick Chrysler, who defeated Bob Mitchell.
 
 SENATE, 99% reporting
 Abraham, 1,577,675, 52%
 Carr, 1,298,659, 43%
 GOVERNOR, 99% reporting
 Engler, 1,892,215, 61%
 Wolpe, 1,186,436, 39%
 
MINNESOTA
Democrats saw a rare opportunity to take a Republican-held seat when Senator Dave Durenberger decided to retire. But Ann Wynia, a Democrat, lost a race in which she and her Republican opponent, Rod Grams, portrayed each other as extremists.
Ms. Wynia, the former majority leader in the State House, had the support of women's groups and stressed the need for a greater government role on social issues. But Mr. Grams, a House freshman with a voting record as conservative as any in the House,called for a smaller Government that is tougher on crime.
Gov. Arne Carlson, a Republican moderate, won re-election in a landslide over State Senator John Marty, who changed campaign managers three times.
 
 SENATE, 100% reporting
 Grams, 595,869,568, 49%
 Wynia, 781,496, 44%
 GOVERNOR, 100% reporting
 Carlson, 1,101,345, 63%
 Marty, 591,350, 34%
 
MISSOURI
A nine-term Democrat attacked as a liberal spender and supporter of big government, Representative Harold L. Volkmer, showed just how vulnerable incumbents could be this year. He was in a tight race from the start.
But he also displayed the power of incumbency in his defeat of Kenny Hulshof, a Republican state prosecutor. In his campaign, Mr. Volkmer stressed his effectiveness in Washington, citing among other things his sponsorship of a 1993 House bill to help the state's flood victims.
Mr. Hulshof had tried to capitalize on disgust with Congress, signing the "Contract With America," a Republican agenda pledging tax cuts and a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget.
The Republicans did retain the Senate seat that was opened by the retirement of John C. Danforth. John Ashcroft, a Republican and former Governor, defeated his Democratic opponent, Representative Alan Wheat, the first black to be nominated for statewide office in Missouri.
Mr. Ashcroft supports giving line-item veto power to the President and passage of a balanced budget amendment.
The Republicans also kept a House seat in southwestern Missouri, where Representative Mel Hancock defeated the Democrat, James R. Fossard, a lawyer.
 
SENATE, 100% reporting
Ashcroft, 1,058,320, 60%
Wheat, 633,941, 36%
 
NEBRASKA
In the bleak Republican desert of Tuesday's elections for Democrats, Nebraska was an oasis. Senator Bob Kerrey breezed to re-election over his Republican challenger, Jan Stoney, a former top executive at US West, by reminding votes that he and President Clinton have clashed repeatedly.
The governor's mansion also stayed in Democratic hands as Gov. Ben Nelson easily beat Gene Spence, the Republican candidate and director of Omaha Public Power.
Not all Democrats were so lucky. In the Second Congressional District, Jon Christensen, an insurance executive, toppled a three-term incumbent, Peter Hoagland.
 
 SENATE, 100% reporting
 Kerrey, 314,442, 55%
 Stoney, 258,417, 45%
 GOVERNOR, 100% reporting
 Nelson, 420,048, 74%
 Spence, 146,971, 26%
 
NORTH DAKOTA
Senator Kent Conrad, the freshman Democrat who once vowed that he would not seek re-election if he could not cut the deficit, defeated Ben J. Clayburgh, an orthopedic surgeon. Coming from a state that handed its three electoral votes to President Bush in 1992, Mr. Conrad kept his distance from Mr. Clinton. In his advertisements, he allied himself with Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, noting that he had voted with Mr. Dole more than half the time.
In the contest for the state's sole House seat, the Democratic incumbent, Earl Pomeroy, soundly defeated State Representative Gary Porter.
 
 SENATE, 99% reporting
 Clayburgh, 98,069, 42%
 Conrad, 135,668, 58%
 
OHIO
For decades an important battlefield in Presidential campaigns, Ohio now looks like a hard sell for President Clinton in his 1996 re-election campaign. Republicans took one Ohio Senate seat from the Democrats on Tuesday, kept the governor's mansion and converted a 10 to 9 deficit in the state's House delegation into a 13 to 6 advantage.
Lieut. Gov. Mike DeWine easily beat Joel Hyatt, the founder of a chain of legal clinics, in the race to replace Senator Howard Metzenbaum, who is retiring and is Mr. Hyatt's father-in-law. The candidacy of Joseph Slovenec, an anti-abortion campaigner who attracted many votes from conservatives, prevented Mr. DeWine's margin of victory from being even larger. A survey of voters leaving polling places found that distaste for President Clinton and Mr. Hyatt's background as a lawyer mattered most to Mr. DeWine's supporters.
Gov. George V. Voinovich easily won re-election over Robert Burch, a Democratic State Senator.
 
 SENATE, 100% reporting
 DeWine, 1,818,126, 53%
 Hyatt, 1,330,287, 39%
 Slovenec, 268,386, 8%
 GOVERNOR, 100% reporting
 Burch, 829,859, 25%
 Voinovich, 2,382,591, 72%
 
SOUTH DAKOTA
To little surprise, the Republicans maintained control of the governership even though the Republican incumbent, Gov. Walter D. Miller, had lost in the primary.
William Janklow, the Republican candidate, easily defeated his Democratic opponent, Jim Beddow, the former president of Dakota Wesleyan University.
A major factor was that Mr. Janklow was much better known, having been Governor for two terms. He was barred from seeking a third consecutive term by state law.
Mr. Janklow had been criticized as a dictatorial Governor. But he was also praised for getting things done, including luring credit-card companies like Citibank to the state.
Representative Tim Johnson, a Democrat, was elected to a fifth term.
 
 GOVERNOR, 99% reporting
 Janklow, 172,500, 55%
 Beddow, 126,258, 41%
 
WISCONSIN
While anti-incumbent Republicans swept many states, Senator Herb Kohl, a centrist Democrat, held his own, fending off a challenge from Robert T. Welch, a conservative Republican. Senator Kohl, the owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team and many commercial properties, spent millions of dollars of his own money to win the seat in 1988, and millions more to keep it.
And Gov. Tommy G. Thompson won a third term, pulling more than twice as many votes as his Democratic opponent, State Senator Charles J. Chvala. Governor Thompson has remained a voter favorite in part because of his tough stance on welfare -- the state's welfare rolls have shrunk by 23 percent during his tenure -- and Mr. Chvala aroused little voter interest with his charge that Mr. Thompson was unconcerned that poverty among children rose as welfare payments fell.
 
SENATE, 100% reporting
Kohl, 912,826, 58%
Welch, 637,103, 41%
GOVERNOR, 100% reporting

 BODY:

ALASKA
A Democratic incumbent is leading, but the party may have to wait until next week before it celebrates. That is, if it gets to celebrate at all.
With 100 percent of the precincts reporting, Gov. Tony Knowles has a lead of 339 votes over James Campbell. But 7,500 absentee ballots remain to be counted and a winner will not be declared until Monday. Lieut. Gov. Jack Coghill, running as the Alaska Party Choice, held 13 percent of the vote. 
 One campaign issue centered on whether Indian villages, instead of sportsmen or corporations, should have priority over fish, game and land.
Mr. Knowles went into the election with a big lead in the polls despite acerbic advertisements run by Mr. Campbell, a retired Anchorage businessman.
For the fifth time in two decades, a measure to move the state capital from Juneau, a waterfront city of 26,000 people, to Wasilla, a frontier-like town of 4,000 people, failed, partly because of voter concerns about the cost of the move. This time, 54.7 percent of the voters said no while 45.3 percent were for the change.
 
 GOVERNOR, 100% reporting
 Campbell, 77,969, 41%
 Knowles, 78,308, 41%
 Coghill, 24,766, 13%
 
ARIZONA
It was a bad year all around for Democrats in Arizona. In one of six Senate races across the nation in which Democratic incumbents were not seeking re-election, Arizona went as the others did: to the Republican Party.
For the seat vacated by Dennis DeConcini, who is retiring, Representative Sam Coppersmith, a freshman Democrat, lost to Representative Jon Kyl, a four-term Congressman who has been a leader of the Conservative Opportunity Society, a Republican caucus founded by Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
Democratic designs on Arizona's governorship failed as well, despite a strong campaign by Eddie Basha, a supermarket magnate, who ran against the Republican incumbent, Fife Symington.
Governor Symington used Mr. Basha's support for homosexual marriages to undercut the challenger's popularity among conservative Democrats.
Republicans also picked up three House seats, including the one Mr. Coppersmith vacated and one in the Sixth District, where Representative Karan English, a Democrat, fell to J. D. Hayworth, a first-time candidate and a former sportscaster.
 
 SENATE, 99% reporting
 Coopersmith, 427,285, 40%
 Grainger, 73,156, 7%
 Kyl, 577,934, 54%
 GOVERNOR, 99% reporting
 Basha, 484,307, 44%
 Symington, 570,501, 52%
 
CALIFORNIA
Angry over crime and illegal immigration, Californians overwhelming approved a tough new initiative against undocumented workers and re-elected Gov. Pete Wilson, positioning the 61-year-old Republican for a possible Presidential bid in 1996.
Once 23 points behind his Democratic rival, Kathleen Brown, the State Treasurer, Mr. Wilson pounded away on the two themes Golden State residents said they worried about most: porous borders and crime.
The Republican surge even swept the singer Sonny Bono into a Southern California Congressional seat. And Republicans picked up seven seats in the State Assembly, leaving the lower house tied at 40 to 40 and making the selection of a new speaker and other leaders more difficult. Democrats have controlled the Assembly since 1971.
But Republican coattails came up short in one of the nastiest and costliest races of the 1994 campaign. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Democrat, edged Representative Michael Huffington, the Republican challenger, after the two candidates spent weeks and a total of nearly $38 million calling each other liars and hypocrites, and swapping charges of hiring illegal nannies. Mr. Huffington has refused to concede until 500,000 absentee ballots are counted.
Ms. Feinstein, a native Californian with 20 years in government, was supported by voters who cited her experience, while Mr. Huffington tapped into voters angry over illegal immigration. But Mr. Huffington's Texas roots and willingness to spend as much of his own money as needed to win may ultimately have doomed his candidacy.
The emotionally charged Proposition 187, which would bar illegal aliens from welfare, education and nonemergency health services, seemed to buoy the fortunes of virtually all Republicans. The party was one of the measure's biggest financial backers.
Californians approved the measure by 59 to 41 percent, but yesterday a state judge in San Francisco issued an order blocking the expulsion of illegal immigrants from public schools and colleges.
Health-conscious Californians rejected one initiative backed by the tobacco industry to loosen anti-smoking laws and another to create a single-payer health-care system.

COLORADO
Compared to the rest of the country, voters in Colorado were gentle to their Democratic incumbents, re-electing their Governor and two longtime members of Congress.
Portraying himself as a centrist and problem solver, Gov. Roy Romer, who was endorsed by Ross Perot, was able to deflect much of the anger aimed at other Democrats. His campaign for a third term was greatly helped last month by a series of miscalculations and embarrassing personal disclosures by his challenger, Bruce Benson, an oilman and a former state Republican chairman. Until then, Mr. Benson had been gaining in the polls.
Representatives Patricia Schroeder and David Skaggs avoided the anti-Democrat wind that toppled incumbents elsewhere. Republicans handily won the state's four other House seats.
Among the initiatives on the ballot, voters soundly rejected one that would have increased tobacco taxes by 2.5 cents per cigarette to raise money for educational programs and medical research related to smoking. They also turned down an initiative to give towns and cities more power to regulate sexually explicit books, magazines and videos.
 
 GOVERNOR, 100% reporting
 Benson, 430,252, 39%
 Romer, 616,521, 55%
 
HAWAII
In a wild, three-way race featuring no incumbent governor, Lieut. Gov. Ben Cayetano, a Democrat, won by eking out a few thousand more votes than his opponents in a state so dominated by the Democrats that a Republican was last elected chief executive in 1959.
A decline in tourism, as well as rising living costs and welfare rolls, threatened the Democrats' grip on the office. And Patricia F. Saiki, a former Republican Representative, who focused her campaign on reducing crime and improving Hawaii's economy, led in polls for much of the year. In the end, though, voters were apparently more comfortable with Mr. Cayetano, a liberal Democrat less concerned with crime than with education.
But with only 37 percent of the vote, Mr. Cayetano's mandate is not what Democrats are used to in Hawaii. The challenge of a popular independent, Frank Fasi, a former Mayor of Honolulu, siphoned votes from both parties. In fact, Mr. Fasi got more votes than Ms. Saiki.
Senator Daniel K. Akaka, the incumbent Democrat, won an overwhelming victory.
 
 SENATE, 100% reporting
 Akaka, 256,189, 72%
 Hustace, 86,320, 24%
 GOVERNOR, 100% reporting
 Cayetano, 134,978, 37%
 Fasi, 113,158, 31%
 Saiki, 107,908, 29%
 
IDAHO
For the first time in 29 years, the Governor of Idaho will be a Republican.
Retiring Gov. Cecil D. Andrus will be succeeded by Phil Batt, a former Lieutenant Governor and part-time onion farmer, who defeated Larry Echohawk, the Democratic Attorney General who had hoped to become the nation's first Indian governor.
Larry LaRocco, a two-term Democratic Representative from Boise, was defeated by by a Republican energy consultant, Helen Chenoweth. Mr. LaRocco's campaign never recovered from revelations that his former brokerage firm had paid his female assistant $40,000 to settle a sexual discrimination lawsuit. In 1992, before the suit was filed, Mr. LaRocco said rumors of the relationship were a lie, but he was forced to backpedal and acknowledge it this time around.
Idaho voters also approved a proposition to limit state and Federal terms and appeared to have narrowly defeated an anti-gay-rights amendment.
 
 GOVERNOR, 99% reporting
 Batt, 214,809, 52%
 Echohawk, 181,471, 44%
 
MONTANA
Retaining a seat once thought ripe for a Democratic take-away was not easy for Senator Conrad Burns, who campaigned hard and spent heavily to overcome poor ratings from voters and criticism for traveling at lobbyists' expense. But Mr. Burns soundly defeated his Democratic challenger, Jack Mudd, a Missoula lawyer and novice candidate, becoming the first Republican this century to be returned to the Senate from solidly Democratic Montana.
In a race in which the incumbent seemed to have so many weak spots, Democrats were confounded by Mr. Burns's popularity. A recent poll showed that despite a highly publicized remark in which he used a racial epithet to refer to blacks, his support grew from 44 percent at the start of the campaign to 51 percent at the end. Advertisements criticizing him for taking 63 trips that were underwritten by lobbyists failed to turn voters against him. Support for Mr. Mudd, who had trouble raising money, remained about 37 percent throughout the campaign.
In the nation's most populous Congressional district (Montana lost a second seat to reapportionment after the 1990 Census), Pat Williams, an eight-term Democratic Representative, survived a strong challenge by Cy Jamison, former director of the Bureau of Land Management.
 
 SENATE, 95% reporting
 Burns, 212,618, 62%
 Mudd, 128,950, 38%
 
NEVADA
Nevada, at least, was a welcome place for the Democrats this year. Gov. Bob Miller was the person principally responsible for delivering Nevada to the Democratic column for Bill Clinton in 1992, and his Republican opponent this year, Assemblyman Jim Gibbons, worked tirelessly to remind voters of it, but to no avail.
Senator Richard H. Bryan, a Democrat, was also re-elected, defeating Hal Furman, a Republican.
Nevada voters also faced a slew of ballot propositions, approving two that added the state to the list of those trying to impose term limits on local and Federal officeholders. Voters also overwhelmingly approved a referendum question requiring a two-thirds vote of the Legislature to raise taxes.
 
 SENATE, 99% reporting
 Bryan, 193,444, 51%
 Furman, 155,547, 41%
 GOVERNOR, 100% reporting
 Miller, 199,891, 53%
 Gibbons, 156,637, 41%
 
NEW MEXICO
Republicans fought long and hard for a Senate seat in New Mexico, where Colin R. McMillan, a Republican rancher and oilman, jumped on his opponent, Senator Jeff Bingaman, for supporting many of President Clinton's policies, most notably higher grazing fees.
But the attempt to swing rural voters his way while cashing in on anti-Administration sentiment was not enough, and Senator Bingaman prevailed in a close contest.
Senator Bingaman, a Clinton-style policy enthusiast, was faulted for running a lackluster campaign that was slow to counterattack and studiously focused on issues like technology conversion and education technology.
But as Mr. McMillan pulled to within three percentage points of Mr. Bingaman in polls near the end of the campaign, the Senator began running negative television advertisements that questioned Mr. McMillan's support of Social Security and Medicare.
Mr. McMillan, a former Assistant Defense Secretary, was also criticized for pumping more than $1 million of his own money into his campaign and not fully disclosing the expenditures.
Democrats did not fare as well elsewhere. A strong state economy was not enough to prevent Gov. Bruce King, the Democratic incumbent, from losing to Gary E. Johnson, a construction company owner. An independent candidate, Roberto Mondragon, collected enough votes to establish his Green Party as a major party under the state's election law.
 
 SENATE, 99% reporting
 Bingaman, 243,759, 54%
 McMillan, 205,334, 46%
 GOVERNOR, 99% reporting
 Johnson, 224,411, 49%
 King, 182,154, 40%
 Mondragon, 47,080, 10%
 
OREGON
Although efforts to overhaul health care stalled in Congress, the issue propelled Dr. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat, into the governorship. Dr. Kitzhaber, who designed Oregon's health care rationing plan, beat Denny Smith, a former Republican Congressman.
Republicans also failed in their effort to take the seat held by Representative Elizabeth Furse after she waged an expensive campaign in which she portrayed herself as tough on both crime and Pentagon waste.
It also helped that her Republican opponent, Bill Witt, a businessman, had been criticized for his past ties to the Oregon Citizens Alliance, a conservative group promoting issues like a measure to limit government protections for homosexuals.
That initiative, which would have prohibited state and local governments from enacting laws to shield homosexuals from discrimination, was defeated by voters, as was a similar measure two years ago.
Also on the ballot was a measure to allow the terminally ill to obtain lethal prescriptions for suicide. That measure appeared headed for victory, but opponents refused to concede yesterday.
 
 GOVERNOR, 99% reporting
 Kitzhaber, 501,539, 53%
 Smith, 386,484, 41%
 
UTAH
 Although Utah has been in the vanguard of the rapidly spreading movement to limit political tenure -- earlier this year state legislators scored a first by voting to limit their own terms, not somebody else's -- voters turned down a chance to be even tougher.
In doing so, Utah avoided creating a bizarre situation in which the state would have had conflicting laws on term limits since the latest petition, which was circulating before the Legislature passed its own version, would have held terms to 8 years while the Legislature allowed 12. But voters did approve a measure giving crime victims the right to a role in prosecuting their attackers.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Republican, breezed to victory for a fourth term and is poised to become chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. And Enid Greene Waldholtz, a free-spending Republican, turned out Karen Shepherd, a freshman Democratic reformer, in a rematch of their 1992 race.
 
 SENATE, 100% reporting
 Shea, 146,731, 28%
 Hatch, 356,345, 69%
 
WASHINGTON
 Throughout this year's campaign, no man or woman so symbolized four decades of Democratic rule in the House as Speaker Thomas S. Foley, a silver-haired, silver-tongued patrician. Yet his sheer power and visibility proved his undoing on Tuesday, as he lost to a little-known Republican who called for change and portrayed as a vice even Mr. Foley's talent for bringing home Federal money to Washington's Fifth District.
George Nethercutt, the 50-year-old chairman of the Spokane Republican Party, received considerable help from national talk show hosts and the former Presidential candidate Ross Perot, who heaped abuse on Mr. Foley. The Democratic leader tried to defend himself by campaigning heavily, warning prophetically that Mr. Nethercutt's election might mean moving the speakership to Marietta, Ga., home of Republican Representative Newt Gingrich.
Voters across Washington abandoned their longtime Democratic leanings. The political complexion of the state's House delegation, eight Democrats and one Republican now, changed radically, with seven Republicans and only two Democrats elected to next year's session of Congress. Senator Slade Gorton, another Republican, won re-election against Ron Sims, a member of the County Council in King County, which includes Seattle.
 
 SENATE, 99% reporting
 Gorton, 796,233, 55%
 Sims, 654,357, 45%
 HOUSE, 99% reporting
 Foley, 97,448, 49%
 Nethercutt, 99,622, 51%
 
WYOMING
The nation's first transcontinental railroad runs across southern Wyoming, and descendants of its builders have long voted Democratic. But Republicans in the state's ranching and mining communities prevailed this year. Unpopular Clinton Administration policies, especially moves to raise fees for grazing cattle on Federal land, helped Republicans retain House and Senate seats and win the governorship.
In the race to replace Senator Malcolm Wallop, a Republican who is retiring, Representative Craig Thomas, Wyoming's only House member, beat Gov. Mike Sullivan. Another Republican, Barbara Cubin, won Mr. Thomas's House seat, and Jim Geringer, a State Senator, easily beat Kathy Karpan, Wyoming's Secretary of State, to take Mr. Sullivan's place as Governor.
Voters defeated ballot propositions to legalize slot machine gambling and to subject people performing abortions to felony prosecution, except in cases of rape or incest or when the woman's life is in danger.
 
 SENATE, 100% reporting
 Sullivan, 79,553, 40%
 Thomas, 118,061, 59%
 GOVERNOR, 100% reporting
 Geringer, 117,491, 59%
 Karpan, 80,383, 40%

CONNECTICUT
If there is a survival model for shaken Democrats, it would seem to be Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who in one term has soared to seeming invincibility with his moderate views and superior connections that include many prosperous supporters in New York and Hollywood. Despite being a friend of President Clinton, he defeated Gerald Labriola, a retired pediatrician and former State Senator whose campaign never took shape, by more than 2 to 1 and consolidated his hold on one of his party's most secure Senate seats.
But the crowded governor's race, dominated by debate over taxes, seemed to offer few lessons. John G. Rowland, a Republican and former Representative, outlasted three opponents, the closest being William E. Curry Jr., the Democratic state controller, after a disclosure late in the campaign that Mr. Rowland had tried to suppress a police report about a quarrel with his former wife. 
 Representative Gary Franks, who in 1990 became Connecticut's first black member of Congress and the first black House Republican with voting status in 55 years, beat a challenge by James H. Maloney.

DELAWARE
William V. Roth Jr.'s re-election seems to indicate that the general sentiment in this election was more anti-Democrat than anti-incumbent. How else to explain how this quintessential incumbent, 73 years old and seeking a fifth Senate term, managed to rack up a 14-point victory over Charles M. Oberly 3d, the state's 47-year-old Democratic Attorney General, who had superior crime-fighting credentials and was a proven commodity in statewide campaigns?
Mr. Roth, in fact, had looked so vulnerable that Representative Michael N. Castle, a former Governor, considered challenging him in the primary. But an expensive television blitz by Mr. Oberly failed to enliven voters, and he lost ground in the final weeks.
Mr. Castle retained the state's only House seat by routing Carol Ann DeSantis, a hospital executive.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
Former Mayor Marion Barry's victory in the District's mayoral race was never seriously in doubt. The surprise lay in the strong showing by Carol Schwartz, a white Republican running in a heavily black and Democratic city. She benefited from an unusually high turnout in the city's predominantly white neighborhoods and support among blacks that was stronger than expected.
Mr. Barry won a three-way Democratic primary in September with only 47 percent of the vote. Many backers of his primary opponents apparently crossed party lines on Tuesday to avoid voting for a man whose last term as Mayor ended with a drug conviction in 1990 and a six-month jail term.

MAINE
In this state, where Ross Perot won 30 percent of the vote in the 1992 Presidential election, the fiercely independent streak of voters appears to have been a major factor again.
Angus King, a businessman who ran for governor as an independent, was elected in a narrow victory. Maine has now had two independent governors within the last 20 years, and it is now the only state in the nation with an independent governor. Mr. King defeated Joseph E. Brennan, a Democrat who was Governor from 1979 to 1987.
And Olympia J. Snowe, a Republican, soundly defeated her Democratic opponent, Thomas H. Andrews, in the Senate race after a campaign in which Ms. Snowe's moderate Republican views drew support from many who had voted for Mr. Perot.
"Maine voters have always had a love affair with 'none of the above,' " said Al Diamon, who writes a political column for The Bangor Daily News.
This was to have been a relatively calm political year in this state, with much of the attention focused on the governor's race. But Senator George J. Mitchell's plan to retire set off a ripple effect throughout the state, as both Mr. Andrews and Ms. Snowe gave up their House seats to run for senator.

MARYLAND
In a state where Democrats hold a 2-to-1 edge in voter registration, the chances that a Republican would seize the governor's chair seemed slim. But in one of the closest races in Maryland history, Parris N. Glendening, a Democrat and three-term Prince George's County executive, and Ellen R. Sauerbrey, the Republican leader of the Maryland House, hooked up in a cliffhanger.
Mr. Glendening and his running mate, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, led by about 6,000 votes with all precincts reporting, but both sides claimed victory would be theirs once 50,000 absentee ballots were tallied later this week.
Ms. Sauerbrey had recently pulled even with Mr. Glendening by patterning her campaign after that of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, pledging tax cuts.
With a record ripe for an anti-Clinton vote, Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, a Democrat, also seemed vulnerable. But the three-term Senator brushed aside a challenge from William E. Brock 3d, a former Republican Senator from Tennessee, who never effectively countered Mr. Sarbanes's accusations that he was a carpetbagger.

MASSACHUSETTS
It was a close race, at least early on, between two candidates with familiar political names and huge personal fortunes.
In the end, Senator Edward M. Kennedy managed to buck the Republican tide and anti-incumbent sentiment and defeat his challenger, Mitt Romney. He did it by stressing his 32 years of experience, his grasp of the issues and his influence on Capitol Hill.
But his victory, one of the few bright spots for Democrats, came only after a hard-fought final month of campaigning.
Mr. Romney, a venture capitalist and a onetime Mormon missionary, had been even with Mr. Kennedy in polls in September. In harsh television advertisements, Mr. Romney, the son of former Gov. George Romney of Michigan, strove to portray Mr. Kennedy as a has-been, worn-out and obsolete. One commercial showed the Senator having difficulty sitting.
But the Republican fell behind as Senator Kennedy rose to the challenge in the campaign's final weeks and Mr. Romney's performances in two debates failed to shift the race. To a large extent, Mr. Romney was successful only in casting himself as someone who was "not Ted Kennedy," as one pollster said.
Mr. Kennedy, a liberal icon who has won six times with at least 55 percent of the vote, was an uncomfortable campaigner. But he counterattacked in the last month, characterizing Mr. Romney as a businessman who "puts profits over people."
In the race for the governorship, Gov. William F. Weld, a Republican who has been mentioned as a possible Presidential contender in 1996, rolled over State Representative Mark R. Roosevelt.
 
 SENATE, 99% reporting
 Kennedy, 1,257,945, 58%
 Romney, 888,435, 41%
 GOVERNOR, 99% reporting
 Roosevelt, 606,648, 28%
 Weld, 1,521,561, 71%
 
NEW HAMPSHIRE
With no Senate race, the spotlight in New Hampshire fell on a grudge match of sorts in which Republicans succeeded after four years in reclaiming a seat that had been theirs since Woodrow Wilson was President.
Charles F. Bass, a former State Senator, defeated the Democratic incumbent, Representative Dick Swett, by a small margin, making much of his golden pedigree as the grandson of a former Governor and the son of a former Congressman from the state. Despite being outspent by his opponent, Mr. Bass ran a strong campaign, criticizing his opponent's ties to President Clinton. (One advertisement showed Mr. Swett and the President embracing.)
This year's curse of incumbency did not touch Gov. Steve Merrill, a Republican, who defeated Wayne D. King, a State Senator, by a wide margin. And a two-term Republican Representative, Bill Zeliff, also easily beat his challenger, Bill Verge.
 
 GOVERNOR, 100% reporting
 King, 79,493, 26%
 Merrill, 216,755, 70%
 
NEW JERSEY
Discouraged by heavy losses in the State Legislature two years ago and Christine Todd Whitman's stunning victory as Governor last year, New Jersey's Democratic Party rallied hard for Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, and the strong support was apparently enough to give the incumbent a slight edge over Chuck Haytaian, the Republican State Assembly Speaker.
Last spring, Republicans eyeing control of the United States Senate had cited Mr. Lautenberg, a two-term incumbent, as vulnerable. Although Mr. Haytaian raised $3 million less than the incumbent, the challenger, a strict conservative, campaigned ferociously. He appeared often with the popular Governor Whitman, and made a flat Federal income tax the cornerstone of his campaign. But in the end, traditional Democratic backers, including union members, women and voters in Essex and Hudson counties, turned out in big numbers.
In the House races, the Democrats were not so lucky. Frank A. Lobiondo, a Republican State Assemblyman, easily succeeded Representative William J. Hughes, a Democrat retiring after 10 terms. The Republicans gained a second seat as William Martini, a former Assistant United States Attorney, defeated Herb Klein, a freshman Representative, in a closely watched race.
 
 SENATE, 99% reporting
 Haytaian, 954,439, 47%
 Lautenberg, 1,027,167, 51%
 
NEW YORK
New York voters ended 20 years of Democratic possession of the Governor's mansion by turning out Mario M. Cuomo, one of the nation's most persistent and eloquent liberals. The shock administered by the Republican candidate, George E. Pataki, made it clear that Mr. Cuomo was unable to overcome a combination of anti-incumbent, anti-Democratic sentiment along with what could best be described as voter fatigue with Mr. Cuomo himself.
The Pataki victory poses a risky situation for Rudolph W. Giuliani, New York City's Republican Mayor, who crossed party lines shortly before the election to endorse Mr. Cuomo and denounce his party's candidate. Mr. Giuliani was quick to declare his eagerness to work with Mr. Pataki in Albany.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was another Democrat up for re-election this year, but he coasted to victory. Mr. Moynihan was never seriously challenged by his Republican opponent, Bernadette Castro, whose family developed a lucrative business in convertible sleeper sofas.
In another statewide race, H. Carl McCall was elected state comptroller, New York's chief financial officer, becoming the first black candidate ever elected statewide.
 
 SENATE, 99% reporting
 Castro, 1,940,345, 42%
 Moynihan, 2,549,012, 55%
 GOVERNOR, 99% reporting
 Cuomo, 2,286,117, 45%
 Golisano, 210,553, 4%
 Pataki, 2,477,882, 49%
 
PENNSYLVANIA
In a great show of political muscle in this state of blue-collar Democrats and middle-class suburbanites, the Republicans pulled off a coup in the Senate race, a seat the Democrats believed they could maintain.
Rick Santorum, a 36-year-old Congressman from the Pittsburgh area, upset Senator Harris Wofford, 68, in a close race.
A self-proclaimed rabble-rouser who has pledged to reduce taxes, Mr. Santorum called his victory "a referendum against big government."
Senator Wofford won his seat in a special election three years ago largely on a platform of overhauling the health-care system.
In another victory for the Republicans, Representative Tom Ridge took over the governorship by defeating Lieut. Gov. Mark S. Singel. The two men and Peg Luksik, an abortion opponent who ran as an independent, fought a heated race to replace the popular Governor, Robert P. Casey, who was barred from a third term.
Mr. Singel stumbled when it became known that as head of the State Board of Pardons he had recommended parole for a prisoner who was later charged with rape and murder in New York City.
 
SENATE, 99% reporting

RHODE ISLAND
This Democratic-leaning state split its votes in four races but chose Republicans for its two top positions.
In one of the dozen governorships the Republicans gained across the nation, Lincoln C. Almond, a former United States Attorney, narrowly defeated State Representative Myrth York, a Democrat. Mr. Almond, a no-nonsense, take-charge campaigner, impressed voters anxious about crime and the economy.
It was a race that may be remembered more for its primaries. Mr. Almond stunned many by easily taking the Republican nomination from Representative Ronald K. Machtley, who was hurt by widespread anti-Washington sentiment. The Democrats denied renomination to Gov. Bruce Sundlun, whose administration had been plagued by ethical and fiscal problems.
Senator John H. Chafee, a moderate Republican seeking his fourth term, crushed State Representative Linda J. Kushner, the Democratic candidate.
But Democrats won the state's two House races. Patrick J. Kennedy, the 27-year-old son of Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, won the seat vacated by Mr. Machtley. Soon to be the youngest member of Congress, Mr. Kennedy campaigned as the candidate best suited to bring Federal programs and money to the state.
Voters also rejected an initiative that would have legalized casino gambling.
 
SENATE, 99% reporting
Chafee, 213,896, 64%
Kushner, 118,411, 36%
GOVERNOR, 99% reporting
Almond, 164,130, 47%
York, 151,861, 44%
 
VERMONT
Vermont, which is noted for upsets in off-year elections, didn't come close this year.
Senator James M. Jeffords, a Republican who is as apt to vote against the party leadership as with it, beat a Democratic State Senator, Jan Backus, by a comfortable margin despite her late endorsement by the state's biggest newspaper, The Burlington Free-Press. Ms. Backus campaigned for a political role for ordinary people, but her accusations that the Senator had abused the perquisites of office did not help.
For their part, the Democrats enjoyed a landslide as Howard Dean, a doctor who is one of the country's most popular governors, held his Republican challenger, David F. Kelley, to less than 20 percent of the vote.
In the lone House race, Bernard Sanders, a socialist who runs as an independent and caucuses with the Democrats, kept his seat despite being targeted by foes of gun control because of his vote for the crime bill, which included restrictions on assault weapons.
 
SENATE 99% reporting,
Backus, 84,833, 41%
 Jeffords, 102,978, 50%
 GOVERNOR 99% reporting
 Dean, 142,998, 70%
 Kelley, 39,703, 19%
 
WEST VIRGINIA
Never let it be said that West Virginians are ungrateful.
The state depends heavily on Federal aid to help its poor and build its highways, and it has relied on Democratic incumbents to keep the money flowing. While the rest of the country turned to the right this week, West Virginia re-elected its three-member House delegation, all Democrats, and Senator Robert C. Byrd, a Democrat who has held his seat since 1959. Mr. Byrd beat Stan Klos, a Republican real estate developer.
West Virginia's other Senator, Jay Rockefeller, is also a Democrat, giving the state one of the few all-Democratic delegations left in Congress.

HEADLINE: Dr. Fell's Election

 BODY:
Tuesday's vote produced a political upheaval of historic proportions. It decimated the top ranks of the Democratic Congressional leadership, awarded the Republicans control of both houses of Congress and most of the big-state governorships, and confronted President Clinton, who was elected as a minority President, with a stark problem of political survival. Whether he can get any legislation passed and whether he is re-electable now depend largely on the strategic calculations of the likely Republican leaders, Representative Newt Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole, and such obstreperous ideologues as Senator Phil Gramm.
In the aftermath of a calamity that even the Cassandras among them had not predicted, disconsolate Democrats began to ask whether their party was flying apart like a disintegrating galaxy and losing any identity with which American voters could connect. Republicans, in the aftermath of a triumph that fulfilled their rosiest fantasies, are left to wonder whether they can -- or want to -- shift from opposition to governance. 
 The gripes, hopes, wobbles, tics and other impulses filtering through millions of individual synapses contributed to the Democratic defeat. So did some other, more definable factors:
The Government Factor. The vote plainly reflected widespread disgust with big government and impatience with government activism, two things with which the Democrats are most closely identified. The question is how Mr. Clinton, a different Democrat, came to be seen as an old-fashioned tax-and-spender. The best answer is probably the health-care reform program whose Brobdingnagian design -- following as it did his successful (and justifiable) move to raise taxes in order to shrink the deficit -- tagged him in the public eye as an advocate of big government.
The Governance Factor. Americans might have felt more kindly toward government -- and indeed the whole idea of legislation -- had the Democrats actually delivered on Mr. Clinton's campaign promises. On this score, the downfall of Thomas Foley, the House Speaker, was a historic marker of voter discontent with Congressional indulgence of the status quo. Mr. Foley had the devotion of his colleagues, but his defeat was deserved. He did far more to preserve the perks and PAC money of his fellow members than to provide the legislative leadership to support a Democratic President and his program.
The Fell Factor. This has also been known as the Carter factor, and may come to be known as the Clinton factor. It was first described three centuries ago by the poet Thomas Brown. "I do not love thee, Dr. Fell./ The reason why I cannot tell./ But this alone I know full well,/ I do not love thee, Dr. Fell." Exit polls showed that one-third of all voters acted as they did because they disapproved of the President. The polls were not specific, but something about Mr. Clinton -- Whitewater, the early foulups over important appointments, a White House staff that uniquely combined hubris and incompetence, perhaps even his wife -- has clearly nettled many voters to the point of distraction.
The Economic Factor. A puzzler. Unemployment and inflation are low, the deficit is declining and the recession receding. Still, many people -- again to use Mr. Clinton's own words -- feel "insecure." They are easy targets for anyone who promises to put more money in their pockets through tax cuts, which is precisely what the Republicans did.
Give the President this: He is militantly inclusive, even in disaster. Whatever the reasons for his shattering defeat, Mr. Clinton embraces them all. "I agree with much of what the electorate said yesterday," he declared, urging the Congressional majority to "join me in the center of the public debate."
President Clinton has been moved by this election from a controlling to a reactive position. Senator Dole was coolly ambiguous in defining areas of cooperation. Mr. Gingrich seemed to be trying to brainwash himself into believing his own promises of more Speaker-like behavior.
Mr. Clinton must hope that decades of partisanship, a frenzy of Presidential ambition and their bloodthirsty fringe constituencies will lead these Republicans into an extremist binge of socially restrictive legislation. If the Republicans decide to camp out in the responsible center, the President could find himself just another face in the crowd.

HEADLINE: As Washington's Old Order Gives Way, No Clear Signs From the New

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
For American business, the immediate post-election impact from the Republican Party victories is the new faces coming to the fore in Washington as committee chairmanships change hands. Even so, the shift in control may not result in radical departures from current Congressional policies.
Here is a look at several leading industries most likely to be at the top of the agenda next year: 

 
Health Care
 Health care executives yesterday welcomed the Republican electoral success amid signs that limited changes in the system would still be on the front burner in Congress and state legislatures.
They still expect some Federal action because "the Republicans want to be the do-something party," Margo Vignola, a health care securities analyst at Salomon Brothers, said. But broader changes in the health system are already under way in the states and private sector.
"Health care will remain under economic pressure, regardless of the politicians," Kenneth Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said.
 Charles N. Kahn 3d, a spokesman for the health insurance industry in Washington, expects "some kind of incremental package" that would make insurance "portable" for people moving to a new job and prohibit insurers from withholding coverage from people with health problems. Such measures, he said, need not include new taxes or benefits that employers would have to offer.
"The Republicans now have an opportunity to best the President and the former Congress on health reform," Mr. Kahn, executive vice president of the Health Insurance Association of America, said.
Dick Keelty, a vice president of the Warner-Lambert Company, said that pharmaceuticals for the elderly would continue to be an issue. He said subsidies should be limited to the uninsured who cannot afford expensive drugs.
The role of the states in shaping health care is also growing. "This election was about the beginning of a transfer of power back to the states, and one of the key issues will be the financing and reform of health care," said Carl Schramm, executive vice president of Fortis Inc., an international group of insurers.
 Industry analysts noted that Democratic critics of health care companies in Congress lost their powerful committee chairmanships. "Dingell, Waxman and Stark will be in the minority now," Ms. Vignola noted. John D. Dingell of Michigan and the California Democrats Henry A. Waxman and Fortney H. Stark headed important House committees dealing with health issues.
Mr. Kahn agreed, saying that "Their day is gone." MILT FREUDENHEIM

HEADLINE: The New Era of Instability

BYLINE: By John B. Judis; John B. Judis is author, most recently, of "Grand Illusion: Critics and Champions of the American Century."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Since 1968, there has been much talk of a "Republican realignment." Quieted by Bill Clinton's victory in 1992, it resounds again after Tuesday's Republican victories.
This election may in fact hail the emergence of a 20-year Republican lock not only on the Presidency but also on Congress and the statehouses. But it is more likely to usher in an era of greater political turbulence characterized by empty sloganeering, mean-spirited campaigning and the growth of local and national third parties -- an era in which neither Democrats nor Republicans can count on stable majorities. 
 What the 1994 election most clearly signaled was the last fevered gasp of the Democratic majority that has prevailed since 1932. That majority, which controlled Congress and the statehouses even when it ceded the Presidency, was based on a coalition among urban ethnic machines, minorities, labor unions and the white South and Southwest.
In 1948, Strom Thurmond and the Dixiecrats temporarily bolted. In 1968, the Democrats suffered a more permanent reverse, as Gov. George Wallace of Alabama led many Southern whites and some working-class Northerners out of the party to protest Democratic support for racial desegregation. In the late 70's, as international competition forced down real wages and eliminated budget surpluses, the Democrats suffered another wave of defections from voters angered by higher taxes, which they believed were being squandered on new social programs. They became the so-called Reagan Democrats.
These last two splits were fundamental: they removed the basis for a liberal populist alliance between the middle and lower classes and opened the way for a conservative populism directed against immigrants, welfare cheaters and the urban underclass. The Democrats made their share of foreign policy mistakes, but what undermined the party was the voters' perception that it had made irrevocable choices -- on spending, taxes, crime, education -- between its white middle class supporters and its low-income black and Hispanic constituents.
With this dark cloud hanging over them, Democrats lost five of six Presidential elections from 1968 to 1988. Yet except for a six-year hiatus in the Senate, the party maintained power in Congress and the majority of statehouses. In the South, Democrats continued to win by staying sufficiently to the right of the national party to preserve a share of the older Democratic vote, while gaining the new minority vote against even more conservative Republican opponents.
In House and state legislative races, Democrats were aided by the the Republicans' weak local organizations. And they gained the allegiance of well-to-do young voters drawn by the environmental and social movements of the 60's. Once the party of James Eastland, Richard Daley and Hubert Humphrey, the Democrats became the party of Sam Nunn, Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis.
After the 1992 election, the Democrats had a fleeting opportunity to revive the party by uniting the old Democratic constituencies with the voters who flocked to Ross Perot, wooed by his economic nationalism, fiscal conservatism and calls for political reform in Washington.
But the Clinton Administration quickly alienated Perotistas and Reagan Democrats by supporting homosexuals in the military, appointing lobbyists and Wall Street heavies to high positions, abandoning the middle-class tax cut and championing a stimulus package directed at cities.
Of course, no other Democrat could have done much better. While Mr. Clinton made obvious tactical errors, he had to address the needs of cities and suburbs, poor and middle class, under the straitened circumstances of a competitive international economy. It's the same dilemma that has plagued Democrats since 1968.
Mr. Clinton's victory in 1992, like Jimmy Carter's in 1976, was a product of unique circumstances -- in this case, a powerful third-party challenge and a tone-deaf Republican incumbent. Tuesday's elections represent the culmination of the process that began with Mr. Wallace's defection in 1968 but was interrupted by Watergate and George Bush's ineptitude.
This week, Republicans finally established a solid Congressional beachhead in the South: North Carolina's delegation, which had eight Democrats and four Republicans, now has eight Republicans and four Democrats; Georgia's, which had seven Democrats and four Republicans, now has seven Republicans and four Democrats.
Democrats also continued to lose ground among suburban whites in the East and Midwest who had been drawn to Mr. Wallace, Ronald Reagan and Mr. Perot. In a white suburban Cleveland district that went 23 percent for Mr. Perot in 1992, the freshman Democrat Eric Fingerhut was easily unseated. In the suburban Lansing, Mich., district formerly held by Representative Bob Carr, where Mr. Perot also won 23 percent in 1992, a Republican, Dick Chrysler, won easily. Nationwide, Perot voters voted for Republican House candidates by almost two to one.
The Democrats increasingly resemble a rump version of the old New Deal and Great Society coalition, supplemented by some upper-middle-class suburbanites offended by Republican ties to the religious right. Democrats can win elections against oddball candidates like Oliver North and Michael Huffington, but in economically devastated California they couldn't defeat an unpopular Republican Governor running on a platform of bashing immigrants.
Doesn't this mean that a Republican realignment has occurred? Not necessarily. Although united against Mr. Clinton, the Republicans are deeply divided among themselves. These differences surfaced in California's Senate election, where Mr. Huffington was widely scorned by the G.O.P. establishment, in New York's gubernatorial race, and in Virginia's Senate race, where the Republican Senator John Warner endorsed a third-party challenger, Marshall Coleman, against Mr. North. To some extent, the national Republican Party is the fractious Virginia branch writ large. And these internal differences will grow as the party is forced to govern rather than merely oppose.
While some Republican mayors and governors have proved effective leaders, the national party lacks the kind of constructive leadership that would allow it to create national prosperity without exacting the kind of sacrifices it condemns the Clinton Administration for. Representative Newt Gingrich's "Contract With America" was largely a throwback to the campaign platform of 1978, which also promised tax cuts and a balanced budget but led to huge deficits and financial scandals.
Republicans have nothing more to offer Perot voters than the Clinton Administration did. The party leadership is thoroughly committed to free trade and has blocked every effort at lobbying and campaign reform. Now that Republicans have won back the House, they will probably back away from their commitment to term limits. Their conservative populism is thematic rather than substantial.
In all likelihood, this election does not augur a new Republican realignment, but rather more instability. Both parties are likely to remain in the minority while more and more Americans cast about among third parties or abandon politics altogether. Congress will become more contentious, as it was in the late 19th century, and the results will be much the same: the near-impossibility of adopting major social legislation or undertaking comprehensive political reform. It's a situation that cries for change but makes change itself impossible.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: THE BUDGET;
Pataki Voices Shock at Learning Size of Gap in Budget He Inherits

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Governor-elect George E. Pataki expressed shock today upon learning that he would inherit a projected $4 billion budget shortfall next year from the Cuomo administration, but said he remained committed to his campaign pledge to cut income taxes by 25 percent over four years.
Mr. Pataki also asserted that the Cuomo administration should have taken steps to close next year's budget gap this year. "There's no question if there is that much of a deficit looming that it should have been revealed and steps should have been taken during the course of the year to correct our spending problems so we wouldn't be facing them come next April," he said. The state's fiscal year begins on April 1. 
 Mr. Pataki said during the campaign that his tax cut would be paid for through growth in the state's revenues and by curbing state spending, an explanation that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and other critics of the plan derided as unreasonable. Although there was no precise estimate of the size of the budget gap for next year, few in Albany expected it to be as high as $4 billion, a figure that Cuomo administration officials cited on Wednesday. But Mr. Pataki still will have to find far more savings than he has proposed just to balance next year's budget, even before he looks for additional cuts to achieve his tax plan.
The Governor-elect, a Republican, first heard about the projected budget gap when questioned about it by reporters in Buffalo this morning during a victory tour of four upstate cities. "Four-billion-dollar deficit?" he asked incredulously.
After pausing to collect his thoughts, he said: "The Governor leaving us with a $4 billion deficit -- it raises grave concerns. I haven't seen it. I haven't heard that before. We are just going to have to take a look at the numbers and look and see what we can do.
"Obviously, it's very upsetting if there is a deficit at all," he said. "Certainly a deficit of that proportion would be shocking."
Mr. Pataki spoke to reporters while flying from Buffalo to Rochester on a day in which he thanked upstate voters for his victory. He ended his tour in Albany, where he received a baseball bat as a gift from a local Assemblyman and joked, "Let me say there are a few people in the government we might use it on." [Page B4.]
Earlier in the day, top aides to Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Pataki sat down in the Capitol for a first peacemaking session between the victor and the vanquished. Three advisers to Mr. Pataki met for nearly an hour with Mr. Cuomo's chief of staff, Andrew J. Zambelli, this afternoon to begin planning a transition from one government to the next.
Michael C. Finnegan, Mr. Pataki's campaign chairman and closest political friend, led the delegation, which he described as an ad hoc committee appointed by Mr. Pataki. The other members are James G. Natoli, the chief of staff to Clarence D. Rappleyea, the Assembly Republican minority leader, and John F. O'Mara, a former judge and Republican state committeeman from Elmira who is close to both Mr. Pataki and his patron, United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
Mr. Finnegan said Mr. Zambelli acknowledged during the meeting that Mr. Pataki would inherit a large budget shortfall when he takes office on Jan. 1. But he said Mr. Zambelli did not say precisely how large the gap would be.
Mr. Finnegan said details would be provided when Mr. Pataki meets next week with Mr. Cuomo's budget director, Rudy Runko, who was out of town today. Mr. Zambelli declined to discuss the budget today, and Mr. Cuomo did not return telephone calls to his office and to the Executive Mansion seeking comment.
Cuomo administration officials, speaking on Wednesday on the condition of anonymity, said the state may face a shortfall of $4 billion, and possibly more, in next year's budget. This year's general-fund budget is $34 billion.
The shortfall does not mean there is a deficit in this year's budget. In fact, the Cuomo administration projects a small surplus in that budget. But when Mr. Cuomo proposed his budget early this year, he projected that it would leave a gap in next year's budget of $1.4 billion if spending and revenue levels stayed constant, except for inflationary increases.
And after negotiations with Mr. Cuomo, the Legislature enacted a budget in June that included deeper tax cuts and higher spending than Mr. Cuomo had proposed, and the Governor signed it into law. It was clear then that the adjustments made to Mr. Cuomo's proposed budget would leave a larger gap than originally projected. But it was not thought until recently that the gap would approach $4 billion, at least partly because tax revenues are not increasing so quickly as anticipated.
Anne W. Crowley, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, refused to confirm or deny the possibility of a $4 billion budget shortfall, a figure that was reported today in The New York Times. And she said Mr. Pataki was wrong to describe the shortfall as a deficit.
"There has been a projected deficit -- and projected is a very important word here -- every year," she said. "There have been years when we have had projected deficits of up to $7 billion. There were projected deficits in the last two years and we finished with a surplus. It's something you have to deal with when you propose your budget.
"This year, it would be inaccurate to state that there was no knowledge of a projected deficit for next year. There was certainly knowledge that there would be a projected deficit of over $2 billion."
Cynthia Green, a senior analyst for the Citizens Budget Commission, a private organization, told The Associated Press that New York's fiscal status was the worst it has been in years. And other fiscal analysts said today that a shortfall of $4 billion would make the already difficult task of cutting taxes even more difficult.
Mr. Pataki's plan calls for the state to cut income taxes by $5.6 billion over four years, starting with a reduction of just over $1 billion next year. He must submit a budget proposal by Feb. 1.
"If there is this $4 billion deficit, obviously it's going to be very difficult," Mr. Pataki said of the budgeting process. "But I don't find the task daunting."
Mr. Finnegan, the Pataki aide, said his meeting with Mr. Zambelli also touched on the appointments process, labor negotiations and office space. He said Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Pataki probably would speak directly about the transition at some point in the next day or two.
"Drew indicated that the Governor wanted to cooperate with George one on one and offered to be of any assistance in insuring a smooth transition," Mr. Finnegan said of Mr. Zambelli. "He indicated up front that the Governor had asked him not to take any action contrary to the philosophy of the Governor-elect." He described Mr. Zambelli as "gracious."
Mr. Zambelli said: "We're obviously going to have to run a government for the next seven weeks. But we're also conscious of the fact that someone else is going to be taking over after Jan. 1 and we're going to try to make that transition as seamless as possible."
Mr. Zambelli and Mr. Finnegan also discussed the number of political appointments in state government, a matter of dispute that became an issue in the campaign. Mr. Pataki contended during the campaign that Mr. Cuomo controlled between 5,000 and 15,000 patronage appointments and he pledged to cut that number by 20 percent. Mr. Cuomo scoffed at that number, and Mr. Zambelli reiterated today that there are not more than 2,500 political appointments.
Both Mr. Finnegan and Mr. Zambelli said the Pataki aides asked whether the Cuomo administration would provide state office space for the Pataki transition team in Manhattan and Albany, a request that Mr. Zambelli said was "reasonable."
The Pataki aides also asked whether it would be possible to place some members of the transition staff on the state payroll. "I told them I would look into that," Mr. Zambelli said.
Mr. Pataki is expected to make his first announcements about his transition operation early next week after returning from a three-day vacation. Mr. Finnegan said he was sending the Governor-elect off on Friday with a thick briefing book about state policy and personnel issues.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: THE VOTERS;
Defections Among Men to G.O.P. Helped Insure Rout of Democrats

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Large numbers of men abandoned Democratic candidates in Tuesday's elections, a trend that gave Republicans an edge in races around the nation and one that Democratic leaders fear might be hard to reverse.
The overwhelming advantage that men gave Republicans touched races all over the country. For example, in Senate races in Michigan and Tennessee, where Republicans picked up open seats that had been held by Democrats, 61 percent of the men voted for the Republicans. 
 The defections among men to Republicans was compounded by signs that women were less enthusiastic about voting for Democrats this year. The most notable example is in Texas, where Gov. Ann W. Richards, a tough-talking Democrat, drew a far smaller proportion of women in losing to George W. Bush than she had four years ago. In part, that may be because Mrs. Richards's opponent in 1990, Clayton Williams, made statements that were offensive to many women.
And while Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican, had expressed fears that Democratic women would flock to his opponent, Kathleen Brown, that did not happen. He captured 50 percent percent of women's votes; 60 percent of men supported him.
Political analysts say the shift by men to Republicans was fueled by a particular disaffection for President Clinton among men, who are troubled more than women by his stands on issues like homosexuals in the military and health care and because men have become more sympathetic to hard-line Republican positions on issues like crime and taxes, which were central in political campaigns this year.
Nationwide, 54 percent of men and 46 percent of women voted for Republican House candidates, according to a survey of voters leaving the polls, the largest gap since at least 1980.
Black voters, both men and women, continued to vote overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates. But among whites, 62 percent of men voted for Republicans, as did 55 percent of women.
"We got clobbered among white men," said Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of moderate Democrats that Mr. Clinton once led. "When I go around I hear them talking about gays in the military, raising taxes and health care. Clinton has the problem of being more defined by his failures than his successes." Mr. From said there were no easy remedies for winning back men except that Mr. Clinton needed to display tougher leadership on a range of issues.
Some Democratic women said the problem was not simply Mr. Clinton but the lack of interest this year among women in the wake of record gains among female candidates in the 1992 campaign, when the fracas between Clarence Thomas and Prof. Anita F. Hill energized women voters. This apathy, they said, made it difficult for Democrats to counter the movement of men to the Republican Party.
"I see a lot of women stunned," said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, a Democrat who was elected two years ago. She said 1992 was "a new mood for women."
"They were excited and they won and they went home and they didn't realize that it could all be undone in two years," Senator Murray said.
There are still more factors driving men to vote Republican. Many independent voters, including those who backed Ross Perot for President in 1992, voted for Republicans. The supporters of Mr. Perot were disproportionately male. In addition, analysts say many younger men who turned on President George Bush two years ago because they were not doing well financially are now turning on the Democratic Administration because they are still no better off.
"I don't think men feel like they're being helped out," said Charles Rund, a Republican poll taker in San Francisco. "Clinton gave up his economic discussion way too early in the Administration."
Democratic women who ran for office, already fighting a Republican tide, said their campaigns had been complicated further by their sex.
Representative Lynn Schenk, a Democrat from San Diego who was elected in 1992 and lost her race for re-election, said she was in partly a victim of impossibly high expectations for women.
"Two years ago was the so called 'Year of the Woman,' and there were enormous, I think unrealistic, expectations that the women in Congress could somehow in 18 months turn around a mess that was created in 18 years," she said. "It was sort of the 'Mom can fix it' attitude. And mom just needed a little more time. I think there was a backlash."
Some Democratic women said they were at a disadvantage this year not only because greater proportions of men voted for Republicans but also because the sex of the candidates played to the stereotype that women were not as strong on issues like crime.
In Ms. Schenk's case, she said she was hurt by her opponent's effort to make her look weak on another issue, immigration. "I debated my opponent seven times," she said, "where the audience was overwhelmingly white male and overwhelming angry about illegal immigration.
Phil Roeder, who ran the losing campaign of Bonnie Campbell, a Democrat who ran for governor of Iowa, said his candidate's sex was also a disadvantage. "The gender issue was always just under the surface," he said "It raised the hurdle that a campaign needed to clear a little bit higher. The Republicans certainly wanted to portray Bonnie as often as they could as being weak on crime. They'd say, "This is a women, so how could she be tough on crime?' "
One notable exception where women rallied to help a Democratic candidate was in Virgina, where analysts said women and blacks gave an edge to Senator Charles S. Robb, a Democrat. These voters may have been spurred to participate out of concern that Mr. Robb's opponent, Oliver L. North, was not supportive of issues that concerned them.
The biggest disappointment for women on Tuesday was that in addition to Governor Richards, every women who ran for governor was defeated. They were Democratic challengers in California, Illinois, Iowa and Rhode Island, and Republicans in Hawaii and Maine.
They fared better in the Senate, where Dianne Feinstein of California, a Democrat, who claimed victory in a race awaiting a count of absentee ballots, Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, a Republican, who was re-elected, and Olympia J. Snowe, a Republican, captured an open Senate seat in Maine.
In the House, the losses of women who are Democrats were roughly representative of those among Democrats over all. Though a handful of House races with women have yet to be decided, nine Democratic women House incumbents were defeated. Seven of them were elected in 1992 and were from districts that were not heavily Democratic. And those losses were balanced by the victories of 10 women. But the ideologies many of the new women are much different: six of them are Republicans, and their ranks include several who are opposed to abortion.
One of the newly elected Republican House members, Sue Myrick of North Carolina, said she did not believe she was helped or hurt by her sex. "We ran on the agenda that the American people wanted to hear and they said they wanted done. That's the bottom line."

HEADLINE: IRAQIS TO ACCEPT KUWAIT'S BORDERS

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Iraq said today that it would recognize the independence and current borders of Kuwait, a major step apparently intended to allow at least some United Nations sanctions against Baghdad to be lifted.
A declaration of the Revolutionary Command Council, signed by President Saddam Hussein, said Iraq accepted the "sovereignty of the State of Kuwait, its territorial integrity and political independence." The recognition, more than four years after Iraq invaded Kuwait and provoked the Persian Gulf war, was also approved by the Iraqi Parliament and is to be published in the Government's gazette, as required by United Nations resolutions. 
 If Iraq follows through on the pledge and ceases to portray Kuwait in any way as an Iraqi province, this would be its first formal recognition of an independent Kuwait since the small emirate ceased to be a British protectorate 33 years ago.
The move brought only a guarded response from the United States and other members of the Security Council, including the French, who have tried to encourage Iraqi compliance by holding out the prospect of rewards. American and British diplomats said recognition of Kuwait was only one step toward compliance with resolutions that would allow the Council to consider lifting sanctions imposed before and after the gulf war in 1991.
"There is a very long list of things Iraq has to do to get sanctions lifted, which related to its policies and practices, some of which in the last few weeks have not been of the sort to encourage people to lift sanctions," said Sir David Hannay, the chief British delegate.
In Baghdad, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia, who has been urging Mr. Hussein to recognize Kuwait, told reporters that Iraq was still surrounded by "a wall of ice." But according to the Iraqi news agency, he said he hoped there was now a little sun in the sky to begin to melt it.
The Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, has asked for a meeting on Monday with Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate, in her capacity as this month's Security Council President. American officials said this was not to be interpreted as a high-level meeting between Iraq and the United States. Ms. Albright is a member of the President Clinton's Cabinet.
Mr. Aziz is expected to present to the Council the Iraqi declaration recognizing Kuwait and give assurances of cooperation in other matters, including the international monitoring of Iraqi weapons programs. Baghdad's leaders got a less than positive message on that front today.
Rolf Ekeus, the head of a United Nations commission charged with monitoring Iraqi weapons programs, reported to the Security Council that there were come concerns that Mr. Hussein's Government was not giving his team "straight and factual answers" about past suppliers of material for chemical weapons. He also said there was more investigating to be done on an Iraqi research project possibly related to the production of biological weapons.
The Clinton Administration takes the position that the United Nations sanctions program is not a mechanical process in which steps announced by Iraq bring automatic rewards. The United States, sometimes to the annoyance of other Council members, sees the decision on whether to ease sanctions as a political judgment about Mr. Hussein's intentions as well as his actions.
In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman said the United States was studying the Iraqi announcement. "If today's announcements are followed by the necessary implementing measures, it will mark an important achievement for the United Nations Security Council, which has steadfastly insisted that Iraq comply and comply fully with all its requirements," said the spokeswoman, Christine Shelly.
But she added: "The international community will not be satisfied with partial steps. Even if Iraq has by Monday taken the necessary steps to carry out today's announcements, it will have complied with only one of a number of requirements established by the Security Council."
Mohammed A. Abulhasan, Kuwait's delegate to the United Nations, said in an interview today that Iraq's announced decision to recognize his country was "an important step in the right direction." But he added that he hoped this would be followed by the freeing of over 600 Kuwaiti prisoners of war and the return of Kuwaiti property and military equipment seized in 1991.
The economic embargo against Iraq was imposed by the Security Council on Aug. 6, 1990, and allows the importation of only medicines and food. With its economy now in ruins, Iraq is eager to sell oil to raise money abroad, and would be free to sell commodities if it met all its obligations to destroy its major weapons or to allow full control and monitoring of them.

HEADLINE: Clinton Asks G.O.P. to Back Free Trade

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
President Clinton appealed today to the newly victorious Republicans to maintain their party's traditional support for free trade and approve a worldwide trade agreement in Congress, arguing that failure to do so would "jeopardize our leadership and our prosperity."
In a speech at Georgetown University Mr. Clinton, clearly tired as he prepared to leave for Asia on Friday for an economic summit meeting, sounded frustrated that many Americans still suspected that his trade proposals will cost them jobs and cut their wages. 
 His speech was the kickoff of what the Administration hoped a few days ago would be an economic triple-play: a meeting with Asian and Pacific leaders aimed at securing a political commitment to free trade in the region, the quick passage of the trade pact and then the first "hemispheric summit" with trading partners in Latin America.
But as the enormity of the electoral setback on Tuesday settled in on the White House, that ambitious agenda seemed threatened. Mr. Clinton's stature among Asian and Pacific leaders is already somewhat diminished by the election results, his aides acknowledged today, and it would be further undermined if the trade pact failed to pass Congress. The agreement is the base upon which Mr. Clinton hoped to build his still vaguely defined vision of a "Pacific community," binding trading partners from China to Chile.
Mr. Clinton seemed to acknowledge today that passage of the 123-nation agreement known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is still far from assured. He urged Republicans in Congress to make a first showing of post-election bipartisanship and "do what's right for all Americans," arguing that the United States is well placed to gain from the agreement. But he seemed to sense that a growing number of Americans were unconvinced.
"For too many of our people, trade still appears to be a gale force wind, just another threat ready to blow away the prospects of a stable job at a good wage," Mr. Clinton said, with some frustration in his voice.
In private, Mr. Clinton's aides were increasingly concerned that the approval of GATT, as the agreement is called, could run aground in the Senate, or be delayed until the new and far more conservative Congress comes to town. That failure, Mr. Clinton's aides acknowledged, would kill any chance that America's biggest trading partners would agree to more open markets or make vast reductions in their tariffs.
"The combination of efforts to open markets in Asia, the GATT vote and the hemispheric summit will quite literally shape the economic future of America in the next century," Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, said today. "If you delay the GATT to next year you are costing the American economy tens of billions of dollars in growth. I don't think anyone, Democrats or Republicans, wants to do that."
Mr. Clinton's hope is to go beyond GATT and build even greater commitments to open markets in the two biggest regions for American business: Asia and Latin America. In Asia, the plan is to obtain general agreement for free trade by the year 2020 -- a goal distant enough, the Administration hopes, to relieve the fears of China and smaller nations of being overrun by more competitive American and Japanese products.
Officials are hoping for more concrete agendas at the Latin American meeting, saying that the area's common cultures and languages will make it easier to integrate a free-trade region, probably by taking new members into the North American Free Trade Agreement.
While the meeting with the Asian leaders will be more symbolic, there are several challenges and potential risks for Mr. Clinton.
His aides are groping their way toward a redefinition of foreign policy in an age when free-trade zones are debated with a passion once reserved for disarmament talks.
Mr. Clinton's first challenge is to convince Americans of an argument he has been advancing for the past two years: that broader, freer trade with Asia will benefit the American economy and American workers.
It is not an obvious truth. While Asia has been a great new market for American exports, the United States is currently running its biggest trade deficits in the Pacific. The deficit with Japan this year is likely to hit $60 billion, flirting with a record. The deficit with China, the market every American company is rushing toward, was $17.6 billion for the first eight months of 1994.
And there are smaller but significant deficits with South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.
Mr. Clinton is also caught in a moment of transition, a moment in which the United States -- for the first time since World War II -- needs Asia as much as the Asian nations need the United States.
In recent years, trade with the United States has diminished greatly as a percentage of all trade in Asia, meaning that the countries in the region are far more dependent on each other than on trade across the Pacific. In contrast, nearly a third of all American exports are now headed across the Pacific, and that figure is rising.
Moreover, the United States is now one of the least important sources of capital for Asia. About 11 percent of all investment in Asia now comes from the United States.
In fact, the major American influence in the region today stems from the military's continued presence. Most Asian nations want that presence to continue, partly to contain North Korea and partly as a counter to the two biggest military powers in the region, China and Japan.

HEADLINE: Asian Nations Wary on Free Trade

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Nov. 10

 BODY:
The nations of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which represent more than half the world's economic output, all say they agree in principle with President Clinton that the path to further prosperity is to lower ever more barriers to trade and investment.
But as leaders from the United States and the other 17 member countries gather here for a summit meeting, the notion of achieving even a vague commitment for a giant Pacific free-trade zone from Chile to China, even far in the future, has led to apprehension as well as expectation. 
 The Pacific zone was pressed vigorously by President Clinton a year ago, when he spoke in Seattle of an Asian Pacific "community." The leaders are gathering here to decide whether to begin turning that concept into reality by setting a target date for free trade.
Foreign ministers and trade officials will meet on Friday and Saturday here in the capital. On Tuesday heads of state, including President Clinton, will assemble in Bogor, a scenic area just outside Jakarta. In between, the leaders will pair off for bilateral meetings.
To be sure, any declaration that emerges from Bogor will be vague and nonbinding. Exactly how to achieve free trade will be left to future meetings. And the deadlines being contemplated, 2020 for developing nations and perhaps 10 years earlier for some other countries, are far enough away so that it will not have much immediate impact.
But in an organization that spans four continents and levels of wealth ranging from Japan's per-capita output of more than $30,000 a year to China's $400, there are certain to be conflicting agendas.
Initially there were fears that the West wanted to create a model of the European Union, an idea that raised fears of an integrated association that could threaten the sovereignty of member nations.
And many of the Asian nations with closed markets have suspicions that despite Washington's talk of community, it is merely interested in using the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group, known as APEC, to break down trade barriers that prevent American companies from selling more products to the fast-growing markets of the East.
"Asia is an area where there is potential economic opportunity for the United States, and that is as far as it goes," said Derek da Cunha, senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore, describing his view of Washington's priorities.
It is too soon to tell whether Mr. Clinton's ability to influence events here will be weakened by the triumph of Republicans in mid-term elections this week. But the Republican sweep has raised some doubts about whether the Democratic-controlled, lame-duck 103d Congress will approve the GATT agreement at a special session after Thanksgiving. Most nations at the conference are counting on GATT to spur their economies.
The first skirmish of the meeting in Jakarta has already broken out. In preparatory talks this week, the United States objected to a proposed voluntary code aimed at liberalizing foreign investment in member countries, saying it did not go far enough.
China has expressed reservations about a timetable for free trade. "In view of the diversity of the Asia Pacific countries, this timetable should be very flexible," President Jiang Zemin said before leaving Beijing earlier this week.
Even more firm in his opposition is Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, who fears APEC will diminish the importance of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, six countries that are already moving to form a trading bloc. Mr. Mahathir has also championed an East Asian Economic Caucus, which would include Japan but exclude the United States, Australia and other Western members of the larger group.
Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's Minister of International Trade and Industry, said this week that an effort to establish a trade timetable was a meaningless exercise because the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum has no means of enforcement.
Still, many analysts say the prospects for movement forward are probably better now than they were a year ago.
"There is discussion and debate about whether there should be a target or not, but nobody disagrees on trade liberalization," said Ippei Yamazawa, a professor of economics at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo and a member of the so-called Eminent Persons Group, a committee of private citizens that drafted proposals for APEC trade liberalization.
Last year, Asian nations were also fearful that linking up in a big community would subject them to more pressure from Washington on human rights, although those fears were eased somewhat by the decision to detach human rights concerns from China's trade status.
Moreover, this year the free trade agenda is being pushed most strongly by Indonesia, the host country. It is harder for developing nations to resist the appeals of one of their own.
Indonesia last year resisted the United States trade proposals. Some experts say Indonesia's about-face this year reflects the desire of President Suharto to leave an international legacy by making the Bogor declaration something to remember.
Even without the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group, the Asian region is moving toward economic integration. The member nations' economies are becoming too big to grow simply by exporting to the United States and Europe. Now, they must sell to to one another.
Japan's exports to Asia now exceed its exports to the United States, in part because Japanese companies have built a network of factories in Southeast Asia that must be supplied with components and machinery. Some of the biggest investors in China are ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Southeast Asia.
The six Asean nations -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand -- recently accelerated plans to lower tariffs among themselves.
Even some of those who favor free trade, however, wonder whether APEC should be the organization to bring it about. The group was started in 1989 as a forum for discussion. The fact that its name, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, does not end with "organization," "association" or a similar noun attests to the reluctance of its founders to make it an institution. It operates by consensus, without any mechanism for voting, and many members would prefer to see it stay that way.
"At this stage, making it rigid might not be the right emphasis," said Rizalino Navarro, secretary of trade and industry of the Philippines. "The emphasis should be on the direction, not the timetable or the institution."
But APEC is rapidly growing more institutional. Two years ago members decided to create a permanent secretariat based in Singapore, and this year there is talk of expanding it. More committees have been formed. The number of members has grown. And Chile's enrollment at this year's meeting extends the forum into South America.
A big step toward increasing the group's importance came at last year's meeting in Seattle, when the heads of state were invited for the first time.
Another question is whether an APEC free-trade plan is needed and whether it would conflict with or complement the global trading system under GATT or the smaller, more tightly integrated trade zones like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the new Asean Free Trade Area.
"With progress made in the GATT and with progress made in unilateral liberalization, the need for regional arrangements weakens a great deal," said Djisman Simandjuntak, a member of the board of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: THE REPUBLICANS;
New Majority's Agenda: Substantial Changes May Be Ahead

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
When Republicans take control of the Senate and House in January, they will propose a legislative agenda drastically different from President Clinton's, which could lead to substantial changes in a broad array of Federal programs and laws, as well as the workings of Congress. Following are brief looks at the main issues.
 
FOREIGN POLICY
 
 
With Jesse Helms of North Carolina in line to become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Republican majority in Congress is expected to push to cut foreign aid as well as money for the U.N. Republican lawmakers also say they will require a Congressional vote before the United States contributes troops or money to any U.N. peacekeeping mission. 
 Judging from past statements, the Republicans will also take a skeptical view of economic aid to Russia and of the Administration's new agreement with North Korea that freezes the North's nuclear program.
Mr. Helms, a conservative, vows not to rubber-stamp new treaties, and some Congressional aides predict he will oppose ratification of treaties restricting the use of chemical weapons and establishing rules on shipping and mining in the world's seas. He also wants to rethink the level of the nation's contributions to the World Bank and to reduce the size of the Agency for International Development. Mr. Helms, an expert parliamentary street fighter, is also expected to exercise veto power over some nominations for ambassadorships.
With Mr. Dole, who is a critic of the Administration's Bosnia policy, likely to become Senate majority leader, the President will face even more pressure to push other nations to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia. Efforts to set a deadline on withdrawing all troops from Haiti may also gather steam, and it may be harder for Mr. Clinton to win ratification of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a world trade agreement.
Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania, will take over the Senate Intelligence Committee, while Larry Combest, a conservative Republican from the Texas Panhandle, is in line to oversee intelligence matters in the House. Mr. Specter says the intelligence community needs an overhaul, but Mr. Combest has generally supported the Central Intelligence Agency and has suggested that its budget be increased.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Fell Last Month

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Producer prices dropped by five-tenths of 1 percent in October for the second consecutive month, the Labor Department reported yesterday, providing more evidence that inflation remained mild despite strong economic growth for more than a year.
More than anything else, car prices pulled down the Producer Price Index in October. The index measures the prices charged for finished goods as they leave factories, mills and refineries ready for use and are sold to wholesalers, retailers, auto dealers and others. 
 "During the past year, we have seen annual rates of inflation that are among the lowest in a generation," Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement.
She noted that producer prices during the last 12 months had risen by just 1 percent. Moreover, unit labor costs -- the wages paid to make a product -- were up by just nine-tenths of 1 percent.
The Consumer Price Index has risen a mild 2.8 percent for the year through September. The October number will be released next week.
The bond market initially greeted the producer price report by pushing down interest rates yesterday morning. [Page D5.] By late afternoon, however, rates had regained all the lost ground and then some, in part for other reasons. Despite the mild inflation reports, many traders remain convinced, as they have for weeks, that the nation's inflation will soon rise.
To prevent that from happening, the Federal Reserve's top policy makers almost certainly will raise interest rates again when they meet next Tuesday, according to many bond traders. The higher loan rates
would slow inflation by slowing the growth of an economy that lives on credit. In the process, unemployment would rise.
No one knows, however, what the Federal Reserve will actually do on Tuesday. Some Fed policy makers said last week that while economic growth was stronger than they had expected, inflation was weaker. That might suggest, they said, that the economy has more room for growth without inflation than anticipated.
"The bond market rejects that view," Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, said. "The market wants a Federal Reserve determined to preserve the gains against inflation that have occurred so far."
Adding to the fear that inflation will accelerate eventually was the Labor Department's report yesterday that prices for intermediate goods -- steel, plastics, chemicals, metals and the like that go into finished goods -- rose by three-tenths of 1 percent in October, matching the increase in September.
What is more, if food and energy are taken out of the calculation, because they move up and down with great volatility, then intermediate prices have risen by a little more each month since July, reaching an increase of seven-tenths of 1 percent in October.
"If the pressure from intermediate prices keeps coming, eventually this will push up finished goods prices," said Donald C. Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting center at Georgia State University. But he and other analysts noted that while wages accounted for 70 percent or so of a product's cost, materials prices contributed less than 30 percent.
Two other statistics yesterday added a little weight to the view that inflation would remain mild.
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, a measure of the public's willingness to spend, fell in November, according to private subscribers to the index. The university will not release the final index figure until further polls are taken this month.
And the Labor Department reported that first-time applicants for unemployment insurance rose to 330,000 in the week that ended last Saturday, from 322,000 in the previous week.
The producer price report was straightforward. Pricing for new-car and light-truck models accounted for more than 90 percent of the fall, said Angelo Maggi, an economist at the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. New-model prices did not actually fall. But they rose by less than the Labor Department had calculated that they would in October, a traditional month for model introductions. That registered in the October Producer Price Index as a drop in vehicle prices.
"The index is overstating the moderation in automobile and truck prices," Mr. Ratajczak said.
There were no other significant price changes, except for sharp drops in heating oil and gasoline, perhaps reflecting concerns that oil inventories were high, and sharp changes, up and down, in various food products, particularly roasted coffee, which rose in price by 50 percent.
Excluding these volatile changes in food and energy, the "core" Producer Price Index for consumer goods still fell by five-tenths of 1 percent, after a rise of one-tenth of 1 percent in September. With vehicles also left out, the index for finished goods rose just one-tenth of 1 percent.
The index for crude goods -- items like raw tobacco, coal, cattle hides and unprocessed milk -- fell by six-tenths of 1 percent in October and 1.6 percent in September.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Decline After Early Rally

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dropped yesterday, falling back from substantial early gains and ending a two-day rally as the dollar stumbled and investor fears again turned to the threat of inflation.
Some of those fears were attributed to comments made by a Texas Republican, Bill Archer, the incoming chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. He said in an interview on the cable channel CNBC that he favored cutting taxes. 
 Traders said he raised the specter among some market participants of a higher budget deficit, which would mean the Government would have to borrow more, perhaps leading to higher interest rates.
Mr. Archer is scheduled to take over as head of the crucial tax-writing panel when the Republicans take control of the House in January. Among his goals, he said, are a cut in the tax rate on capital gains from investments and the restoration of tax-sheltered individual retirement accounts for upper-income people.
Mr. Archer's comments brought an earlier market rally to a halt. Initially, bonds gained ground following a decline in the October producer prices data. Many had expected the numbers would show an increase instead. It was the second straight decline in the Producer Price Index, suggesting that inflation remains mild. A survey by Bloomberg Business News showed analysts had been expecting a one-tenth of 1 percent gain over all.
The long bond fell 13/32 of a point, to 92 26/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 8.14 percent, after falling as low as 8.04 percent on the release of the producer prices data.
Other news favorable to bonds yesterday included the University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index for November. It slipped to 90.1 from 92.7 in October, slightly lower than expected, indicating that consumers are less optimistic about the economy. That suggests the economy might slow enough for price pressures to ease.
The market caught a second wind as bonds appeared to benefit from speculation that the dollar's weakness would be addressed at a meeting of finance ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations yesterday in Toronto.
James Hale, fixed-income analyst for MMS International, pointed to Mr. Archer's comments as one of the reasons for the afternoon fall. He said the technically driven traders who follow charts and trends also contributed. "They were faked into the market early thinking prices would continue up," he said, "but when prices sagged as the dollar fizzled they reversed themselves and sold to cut losses."
Mr. Hale added, "The fact that we couldn't pull off another solid day after a favorable report underscores that we're still in a bear market."
Some analysts suggested that the absence of significant price pressures in recent reports meant that the Fed was more likely to proceed cautiously in raising rates. Producer prices at the final goods level remained stable in October. But the price increases at the intermediate goods level, excluding food and energy, continue to generate some concern to investors.
"The P.P.I., down for the second straight month, could suggest that the Fed is not as far behind in its inflation watch as the market has feared," said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh. "The rest is just a guessing game."
But the Fed will be looking at an array of information that indicates that economic growth remains strong enough to add to inflationary pressures. "This good number," Mr. Hoffman said, "will not deter them from moving rates up."
The Government bond market is expected to be closed today because of Veterans Day, a Federal holiday. Some dealers, however, will keep skeleton trading crews on hand.
Yesterday, the Treasury sold $17 billion of one-year bills at an average rate of 6.09 percent, and $12 billion of 37-day cash management bills at an average rate of 5.11 percent.

HEADLINE: Restoring the Rails on Staten Island;
Plans for Economic Revival Stretch Along 15 Miles of Track

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
To the people who live on the north shore of Staten Island, the abandoned railroad that cuts through their neighborhoods is an unsightly ruin where prostitutes and drug addicts hide. It barely resembles the gleaming steel line that 40 years ago linked local factories to their markets and carried passengers to the amusements of South Beach.
But to New York City officials, the defunct Staten Island Railway -- a 15-mile stretch of overgrown, rusty tracks and ramshackle stations -- is essential to revitalizing the area's stagnant economy and could provide an alternate freight route that would reduce pollution from trucks. 
 So two weeks ago, the city took the unusual step of buying the railroad, with an eye toward restoring freight service over the next two years and, perhaps, creating a new and possibly less expensive way for freight to reach Brooklyn and Long Island.
Using Federal transportation money, the city's Economic Development Corporation bought the railroad for $10.3 million from CSX Transportation. It said it plans to spend $1 million in state funds to rehabilitate the part of the railroad on western Staten Island over the next year. As part of the deal, the New Jersey Department of Transportation bought the section between the Arthur Kill and Cranford Junction, N.J.
City officials say their main priority is to restore freight service from Staten Island to points west. The hope is to revitalize the idle Howland Hook Marine Terminal on Staten Island near the Goethals Bridge and to make the economically depressed north shore more attractive to manufacturers.
In addition, they said, the line would allow train cars to be floated on barges to the newly rebuilt 65th Street Railyard in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, where they could be hauled east on the Long Island Rail Road or north to New England. This would reduce the number of trucks that traverse the city, clogging the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and highways in Brooklyn.
Staten Island political leaders are also dreaming out loud about resurrecting passenger trains that used to link neighborhoods along the north shore to the Staten Island Ferry terminal in St. George. Although no money is available to rebuild a passenger line -- officials estimate that it would cost $65 million -- the city's purchase has insured that no one else will acquire the old right of way and develop it.
"If you lose a railroad corridor, you never get it back again," said Chris Ward, vice president for transportation for the city's Economic Development Corporation. "That is the biggest issue."
Guy V. Molinari, the Borough President of Staten Island, said he had dreamed for years about restoring rail service to the impoverished neighborhoods along the north shore. He said he believes a passenger train there would revitalize the area economically and reduce the congestion on highways.
For older residents, the proposal to restore passenger service recalls simpler times when railroads were king. Leon Suwalski, 87, can remember his youth when the railroad, built in 1886, was the gateway to the city and, for some, the entire country. Restless young men would hop freight trains going west, he said, while the less adventurous would ride passenger cars to the Staten Island Ferry or the amusement parks on the southern shore of the island.
But in 1953, passenger trains stopped running, and the freight trains that used to supply factories along the route gradually disappeared.
The immediate goal, city officials say, is to break Conrail's stranglehold over freight lines into New York City and Long Island. Trains now carrying goods into New York City must go north over Conrail lines to Selkirk, just south of Albany, then back down the east side of the Hudson, through the Bronx and finally onto Long Island. Or they can travel to a Conrail rail yard between Jersey City and Bayonne, the Greenville Yard, and be tugged on barges to Bush Terminal in Brooklyn.
Conrail, created by the Federal Government in the 1970's from several bankrupt railroads, also controls the flow of goods in the opposite direction. Ships coming through New York Harbor to marine terminals in New Jersey must unload onto Conrail trains before they can reach other railroad lines that go west.
Because Conrail has no competition from other railroad companies, city officials say, it has little incentive to try to undercut the prices of trucking companies for freight business east of the Hudson River in Manhattan and on Long Island.
The result is that most of the goods arriving by freight train into the region stop in New Jersey, where they are loaded onto trucks. The trucks then take them through already congested bridges and tunnels, contributing to air pollution.
City officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the Giuliani administration is considering setting up a paper railroad corporation and seeking permission from the Federal Government to operate between Howland Hook and Cranford Junction. The corporation would then contract with a major railroad other than Conrail to provide service on the line.
New York City is more dependent on trucks than any other city in the nation, with about 60,000 coming in every day. Rail carries only about 2.8 percent of the freight the city uses, while trucks account for 90 percent. On average in the rest of the nation, about 26 percent of freight is moved by train and less than 50 percent is hauled in trucks.
One open question is whether there will be enough ships coming into Howland Hook to make it attractive to a train operators. The city bought the terminal in the early 1970's, but the former tenant, United States Lines, went bankrupt by 1986 as more and more ships opted to go to Port Newark and Elizabeth, in New Jersey.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which leases the terminal from the city, is spending $24 million to renovate it. The authority has found a new tenant for the terminal, Carmine F. Ragucci, and is predicting at least 50,000 containers a year being shipped through the terminal by next year.
For residents on the north shore of Staten Island, the refurbished marine terminal and rail line represent a promise of 1,700 jobs and the possibility of a return to the days before World War II, when people could take trains to the St. George Ferry Terminal rather than join the crush of cars at rush hours on Richmond Terrace, the main road along the north coast.
"Now the railroad is just a haven for hookers and junkies. And Richmond Terrace is jammed with traffic," said George Lauro, 38, who owns a garage next to the tracks in Port Richmond.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Allstate's size helps profits, but also makes for added risk.

BYLINE: By Michael Quint 

 BODY:
AS one of the nation's largest insurers of homes and autos, the Allstate Corporation reaps the rewards of name recognition and economies of scale that in normal times help make it very profitable.
But with that size comes additional risk that the company would just as soon avoid, or at least reduce. A $2.7 billion loss in 1992 from Hurricane Andrew in Florida and a $1.3 billion loss from the Los Angeles earthquake early this year have wreaked havoc on Allstate's profits. After a loss of $500 million in 1992, the company saw profits jump to a record $1.3 billion in disaster-free 1993, but earnings have slumped to $320.7 million in the first nine months of this year. 
 Despite the company's success in recent years in building up both its property insurance and its life insurance businesses, cutting overhead expenses and maintaining a good record for limiting its ordinary loss claims, the vulnerability to disasters has cast a shadow over its stock price.
Since June 1993, when Sears, Roebuck & Company, sold nearly 20 percent of Allstate for $2.36 billion -- the largest initial public stock offering of any company -- its stock rose from $27 to a peak of $34.25 in October last year only to slide to yesterday's close of $24.125, down 75 cents.
Because of Sears's plan to distribute the remaining 360 million Allstate shares to Sears shareholders, some traders expect the stock to come under additional pressure.
A. Michael Franquilli of Salomon Brothers said before the Sears announcement that Allstate's growth and success in controlling costs and day-to-day claims losses justified a buy recommendation. Others, such as Weston M. Hicks of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, have neutral opinions, partly because of its vulnerability to disasters.
Mr. Hicks said that the company was not likely to improve on the stellar performance of its automobile insurance business. He reduced his estimate for 1995 earnings yesterday to $3.05 a share from $3.15 because ending the ties with Sears will eliminate some tax benefits.
Jerry D. Choate, Allstate's chief executive, says reducing the exposure to catastrophe losses was his top priority. But in an interview yesterday, he did not offer much hope for a quick solution.
By not accepting new customers in California and large parts of Florida -- and declining to renew any customers in three Florida counties, soon to be five -- he said the company was making good progress toward reducing its estimated maximum loss from any single event to $1 billion by 1997. But he added that Allstate had still not purchased reinsurance to reduce its losses from disasters "because it is too expensive" and unavailable in the amounts Allstate would need.
In the meantime, Mr. Choate said he watched the weather channel on TV "a lot more than I would like."
John Snyder, senior vice president at the A. M. Best Company, a rating firm, said that operating without the reinsurance that most other companies buy "is a viable strategy for Allstate because they are big enough to survive." But the absence does mean "that from time to time they will suffer some very big losses and have to pick themselves up."
How lucky Allstate will be can only be a guess. But other insurers expect even more costly disasters. Munich Re, a German company and the world's largest reinsurance company, said earlier this week that it planned to reduce its exposure in many parts of the world because climatic changes, including global warming, would lead to more severe storms in areas where population growth and real estate development have sharply increased insurers' risks. "If I was a betting man, I could offer you a bet that the records of recent years will be beaten by new damage records," Wolf Otto Bauer, a director, said in a recent article in The Financial Times of London.
But even if Allstate continues growing and improving its efficiency and is lucky enough to avoid new disasters, some analysts assume that many Sears shareholders will want to sell the stock, thereby depressing its price. Managers of index funds, for example, are big investors in Sears because of its place in the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index, but would have no reason to hold Allstate, which is not part of that index.
Institutions that own both Sears and Allstate may find themselves with more of the insurer than they want. Fidelity Management of Boston, for example, is the largest outside holder of Sears, with 19 million shares at midyear, and also one of the largest holders of Allstate, with 10.7 million shares. Fidelity declined comment.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains, Then Steadies After U.S. Bond Activity

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was steady against most leading currencies yesterday, following United States bonds higher before retreating.
Traders often watch the Treasury market to gauge investor demand for American assets and the dollars needed to buy them. A late slump in bonds prompted traders to pare the dollar's gains yesterday. 
 Bonds and the dollar rose after the Labor Department reported that producer prices fell five-tenths of 1 percent in October. It was the first back-to-back drop in more than three years and a signal that inflation is under control. Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments like bonds, and fears that inflation will accelerate have weighed down the bond market and the value of the dollar this year.
"There is more and more a sense from market participants that the dollar has hit bottom," said Richard Koss, manager of currency sales at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in New York. But for the dollar's rise to be sustained, he said, "we need a signal from the bond market that it has bottomed as well."
The dollar rose as high as 1.5365 German marks yesterday before settling in New York at 1.5285 marks, down from 1.5315 marks. The dollar also slipped against the Japanese yen, to 97.73 yen, from 97.80 yen on Wednesday.
Foreign-exchange trading is expected to be limited today, with many banks and businesses in the United States and Europe closed because of holidays.
Many traders expect the dollar to tumble next week if the Federal Reserve does not raise short-term interest rates by at least a half a percentage point after its policy-making committee meets on Tuesday. The Fed has not raised rates more than that since the early 1980's.
A larger rate increase could bolster the dollar by easing concern about inflation and making American deposits more attractive.
In other currency trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.2831 Swiss francs, up from 1.2825 francs on Wednesday; at 5.2565 French francs, up from 5.2502 francs, and at 1,567.0 Italian lire, down from 1,569.50 lire. The British pound fell to $1.6000 from $1.6055.

HEADLINE: Why Do Male Athletes Assault Women? Research Begins

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
Somewhere between the West Point football gropers and the heavyweight rapist, Mike Tyson, may be a vast, troubling, uncharted area of sexual assault on women by male athletes, a kind of Bermuda Triangle of sports in which discussion mysteriously disappears.
Anecdotal evidence pops up several times a week, a paragraph or two here and there about another pro player beating his wife or a college team raping a drunken classmate, but rarely has an attempt been made to pull this information together to find out if there is a pattern of behavior. Even the coverage of the murder trial of O. J. Simpson, which seems to have diagrammed every racial, sexual, class and economic X and O, seems so far to have avoided dealing with the possibility that football players, as surely as combat soldiers, have been programmed and rewarded for a kind of violence that can't always be turned off. 
 And if there is a pattern of violence, why? Does the nature of combat sport itself build a "character" that is out of control off the field? Are the best of these athletes genetically disposed to be more aggressive? Is it hormonal? Are drugs a factor? Are they conditioned by coaches to regard nonmembers of the team -- including all women -- as the enemy? Is it just a heightened alpha male entitlement, is it a further example of the lack of communication between men and women? Is there a homoerotic strain here, as the writer and counselor Ed Gallagher of Alive to Thrive, a self-help organization for the handicapped, suggests, making athletes angry about their suppressed desires?
Or is all this just more celebrity churn?
Performance athletes are under such intense scrutiny, why wouldn't their police ink blots become mini-series while most rapes, assaults and incidents of abuse are not even reported?

 Whatever the answers, the questions seem to make most sports officials, business people and fans uncomfortable enough to touch their wallets, cross their legs and send in a substitute conversation.
Nevertheless, the exploration of that Bermuda Triangle began in earnest, albeit cautiously, yesterday in Savannah, Ga., with the presentation of a short academic paper to the North American Society for Sports Sociology.
Titled "Male Student-Athletes Reported for Sexual Assault: A Survey of Campus Police Departments and Judicial Affairs Offices," the paper concludes that at 20 schools with highly rated Division I football and basketball teams, surveyed between 1991 and 1993, "athletes appear to be disproportionately involved in incidents of sexual assault on college campuses."
The conclusion is hardly a "Yesss!" to anyone who has been paying attention, but the mere existence of the paper, by three academic men, is worthy of notice. What little work that has been done in the field has tended to be either anecdotal anthologies or serious rape and assault studies by female scholars with little access to sports information. Beyond the conclusion of the paper is a call for more research; specifically needed, according to the authors, are studies involving contact versus noncontact sports, the relation of the coaching staff to the team, and the specific conditions under which women report sexual assault by athletes.
The authors of the paper are from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Todd W. Crosset, a professor of sports management, and Mark A. McDonald, a professor of statistics, and a 28-year-old graduate student of political science at Northeastern University, Jeffrey R. Benedict.

 Benedict, a former high school wrestler and a youth basketball coach, is the engine of the study. Raised in an abusive household, he plans to attend law school next year so he can become a prosecutor of sex criminals. He has already begun work on a more ambitious project, for his master's thesis; a study of three rape cases in which the "consensual sex" defense was used, and why that strategy is considerably more persuasive when the accused is a famous athlete.
"This is a very touchy area," said Benedict in an interview last week in Boston. "Race and socioeconomic status is a huge factor, and lot of people, particularly scholars, are concerned that racial conclusions could be drawn, although no mention is made of race."
The thesis, which is being advised by the well-known sports anthropologist, Alan M. Klein of Northeastern, concentrates on the cases of alleged acquaintance rape involving Mike Tyson, the former Boston Celtic Marcus Webb and a group of Cincinnati Bengals.
"I don't mean to dismiss the seriousness of the West Point case," said Benedict, "but that's childish behavior compared to what I'm studying. On the other hand, whenever women can be looked upon as objects and treated as fun, there's trouble.
"We have to make a careful distinction between rape culture and the behavior of celebrity athletes who, because of their access to women, have a distorted perception of what is appropriate behavior."
The course of Benedict's explorations, an engaging combination of scholarship and self-righteousness, will churn their own questions: will scholars shoot him down, will big-time sports buy him off, will tabloid journalism eat him up? With his wrestler's short hair and pug face, Benedict looks eager for the challenge.
"There's a real make-it-while-you-can, sex-and-money attitude in sports, and it's not so different in music, acting, maybe some aspects of politics," he said. "But there's a special factor here; some of our best athletes are trained in violence and deception, and they just can't turn it on and off when we want them to. And given the money involved, coaches and owners might not want to risk them losing their edge for the game."

HEADLINE: Getting Serious on Bosnian Arms

 BODY:
Prodded by Congress, the Clinton Administration is now asking the United Nations Security Council to lift its unjust arms embargo against Bosnia and has announced that American military forces will stop enforcing that embargo tomorrow. Lifting the embargo is the right policy and the fairest, surest path to an honorable and stable peace.
For years, Washington has been saying that it favors lifting the embargo. But it has never deployed the full diplomatic weight of the United States to get it lifted. Doing so would mean standing up to European countries like Britain, France and Russia that prefer to keep the Bosnians disarmed and impose an internationally brokered partition plan. Instead of trying to win over the Europeans, the Administration has repeatedly backed off the issue. But perhaps there will be a more whole-hearted effort this time. 
 One good reason is that the Administration now must reckon with an increasingly assertive Congress. Even before the elections, Congress voted to cut off funds for U.S. enforcement of the embargo this month. Senator Bob Dole, a strong advocate of lifting the arms embargo, becomes majority leader in January. The Administration is now torn between its desire to avoid a Congressional cutoff and its reluctance to confront the Europeans.
Serbian forces hold 70 percent of Bosnia's territory; the partition map would award them barely half. That is one reason they reject the map, which the Bosnian Government accepts. Recently, however, Government forces, armed with smuggled weapons, have reoccupied some of their lost territory. Further Bosnian gains, which lifting the embargo would encourage, could make the peace plan more attractive to the Serbs.
A stronger Government army would also make Serbia and Croatia more likely to respect Bosnia's territorial integrity in the future, reducing the need for international monitoring of any peace agreement.
Even though Bosnia is now smuggling in enough weapons to turn the tide, formally lifting the embargo is important because it would allow in the tanks and other heavy weapons the Government side still lacks. It would also give Bosnia's political authorities more control over which units get the new arms -- and thereby let it impose more discipline on rogue commanders like those who allegedly attacked residential areas of Sarajevo. A procurement system based on smuggling directs arms to those commanders who have the best underworld connections. Lifting the embargo would also free Bosnia from reliance on radical weapons suppliers like Iran and Libya that have few inhibitions about circumventing U.N. rules.
Still, the embargo will not be lifted unless the U.S. lobbies for votes. Merely declaring that Washington is strongly interested would rally most of the fence-sitting smaller powers. That leaves Britain, which has said it would not veto a resolution; France, which hints it might agree in principle to lifting the embargo but worries about endangering its U.N. peacekeepers, and Russia, which might be able to accept a formula that also eases economic sanctions on Belgrade.
Winning these votes will require compromise language. But any wording that assures Bosnia that it will be able to exercise its right to self-defense -- either unilaterally or through the U.N. -- unless the Bosnian Serbs agree to peace by next spring would be a useful advance.
Until the Administration insists on language that gives Bosnia that minimum right and works hard to round up the necessary votes, senators returning for a special post-election session will need to keep up the heat.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Anger And Reality

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Newt Gingrich was brilliant at playing to the resentment of Americans. Brilliant and nasty. But those of us who disliked his tactics must not let that shut our eyes to the fact that the resentment is there. It is resentment of what many Americans see as an arrogant ruling class, out of touch with their concerns.
What are the reasons for the extraordinary anger, directed at incumbent Democrats right across the country? I believe it is first of all a matter of economics. 
 There is a puzzle here. Unemployment is down, the deficit falling, the national economic figures robust. Yet in exit polls, 6 out of 10 voters agreed that the economy was "in bad shape." Why the discontent?
Figures are deceptive, for one thing. Average real per capita income has been essentially stagnant for years. And "average" is itself a distorting concept. The richest 20 percent of Americans have been growing rapidly richer; their incomes bring up the average figure, but those in the middle and below are losing ground.
Most American families today depend on two incomes. They are working harder, but they feel they are hardly holding their own. They don't know how they are going to send their children to college, or how those children will find jobs that will put them in the middle class -- or keep them there.
Expectations for one's children may be the key factor in political discontent. America is the land of expectations. From the beginning, immigrants and native-born alike, most Americans have expected their children to do better than themselves.
The assumption that the family's lot would improve was heightened during the extraordinary U.S. economic growth of the decades after World War II. In those years America became a country of middle-class homeowners.
And then -- suddenly, it seemed -- the boom came to an end. There was an illusory revival during the Reagan years, based on deficit financing. Today, for many people, expectations are embittered.
To see public resentment in these terms is to understand its seriousness. For the truth is that the economic discontent will not be easily dispelled. The kind of improvement people want is hard to achieve in the real world of the 1990's.
Take the "contract" that Mr. Gingrich produced for Republican House candidates to sign. It calls for higher defense spending and tax cuts totaling $200 billion over the next five years. It also talks of a balanced-budget constitutional amendment. But its hope of a balanced budget in fact rests on the Reaganomics notion that lower taxes will produce higher revenue, which proved to be a fantasy.
So the Gingrich contract would in all likelihood pile more debt on the shoulders of our children and grandchildren. So will the refusal thus far, by both Republicans and Democrats, to do anything about the growing burden of entitlements.
A related part of the public resentment expressed in these elections was dislike of "big government." There is a certain irony in that. Government policy, after all, made possible the housing boom and the growth of international trade that fueled the postwar economic miracle. At the same time that people condemn big government, they want government to do things on their behalf.
But it is true that the Federal Government has grown too large, and far too intrusive in its regulations. Democrats, and in particular President Clinton, should long ago have followed the example of Justice Brandeis, a progressive who believed in decentralization and small institutions. Maybe Republicans can do something on that score.
But the central economic dilemma demands political courage of a kind that we have not seen lately. It requires leaders to tell voters that they cannot have benefits without paying the cost and still expect a better life for their children.
Economic growth requires investment. This country saves and invests much less than its competitors in the world market. If we want our children to have more, we must practice self-denial -- spending less and investing more, both privately and publicly.
It is urgently necessary to address the causes of our economic discontent. If we do not, resentment can easily fall prey to demagoguery -- and to scapegoating that would tear our social fabric.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTION;
In Their Own Words: The Republican Promises

 BODY:
During the election campaign, Republican candidates for Congress gathered in Washington to endorse a set of proposals for legislative action that they called their "Contract With America." They said that in the first 100 days of the 104th Congress, they would introduce bills they described as follows:
 
1. The Fiscal Responsibility Act: A balanced budget/tax limitation amendment and a legislative line-item veto to restore fiscal responsibility to an out-of-control Congress, requiring them to live under the same budget constraints as families and businesses.
 
2. The Taking Back Our Streets Act: An anti-crime package including stronger truth-in-sentencing, "good faith" exclusionary rule exemptions, effective death penalty provisions, and cuts in social spending from this summer's "crime" bill to fund prison construction and additional law enforcement to keep people secure in their neighborhoods and kids safe in their schools.
 
3. The Personal Responsibility Act: Discourage illegitimacy and teen pregnancy by prohibiting welfare to minor mothers and denying increased AFDC for additinal children while on welfare, cut spending for welfare programs, and enact a tough two-years-and-out provision with work requirements to promote individual responsibility.
 
4. The Family Reinforcement Act: Child support enforcement, tax incentive for adoption, strengthening rights of parents in their children's education, stronger child pornography laws, and an elderly dependent care tax credit to reinforce the central role of families in American society.
 
5. The American Dream Restoration Act: A $500 per child tax credit, begin repeal of the marriage tax penalty, and creation of American Dream Savings Accounts to provide middle class tax relief.
 
6. The National Security Restoration Act: No U.S. troops under U.N. command and restoration of the essential parts of our national security funding to strengthen our national defense and maintain our credibility around the world.
 
7. The Senior Citizens Fairness Act: Raise the Social Security earnings limit which currently forces seniors out of the work force, repeal the 1993 tax hikes on Social Security benefits and provide tax incentive for private long-term care insurance to let older Americans keep more of what they have earned over the years.
 
8. The Hob Creation and Wage Enhancement Act: Small business incentives, capital gains cut and indexation, neutral cost recovery, risk assessment/cost-benefit analysis, strengthening the Regulatory Flexibility Act and unfunded mandate reform to create jobs and raise worker wages.
 
9. The Common Sense Legal Reform Act: "Loser pays" laws, reasonable limits on punitive damages and reform of product liablility laws to stem the endless tide of litigation.
 
10. The Citizen Legislative Act: A first ever vote on term limits to replace career politicians with citizen legislators.

Connecticut Revisits its Income Tax

 BODY:
Let no one quibble about John Rowland's 36 percent victory in Connecticut. His share of the vote for governor in a four-way race was not significantly less than Lowell Weicker's winning share in a three-way race in 1990. Governor Weicker used his victory to force adoption of a personal income tax. Mr. Rowland, a Republican with the advantage of a newly elected Republican majority in the State Senate, is pledged to repeal it.
Repeal poses two threats: The tax will yield $2.7 billion this year, more than one-quarter of the $9.4 billion budget. Mr. Rowland maintains that he can offset half the revenue loss with spending cuts that will not cut services -- a dubious proposition -- and that healthier economic activity will offset the other half. Just as bad, the state would again be dependent on regressive sales taxes, and taxes on dividends and corporations that drive people and businesses away. 
 Perhaps when the Governor-elect faces the budget realities he will modify his pledge, as Gov. Christine Todd Whitman did in New Jersey. Mr. Rowland wants a phased repeal over five years. Governor Whitman promised to reduce New Jersey's tax by 30 percent over three years, but she has now stretched it to four. Yet New Jersey's economy is in better shape than Connecticut's, which has suffered from severe cutbacks in its heavy concentration of defense industries.
It is clear that voters everywhere are demanding lower taxes -- and equally clear that newly elected governors must proceed with care.

HEADLINE: Reagan Revolution Redux

BYLINE: By Richard Brookhiser; Richard Brookhiser is a senior editor of National Review.

 BODY:
Tuesday's carnage was not, as many liberal pundits have claimed, a revolt of random wrath against incumbents. The voters directed their fire at liberal Democrats, and set in motion the second stage of the Reagan Revolution, which will make the one-term Presidencies of George Bush and Bill Clinton seem like political hiccups.
The voters want Republicans to address specific problems, some of them spelled out in the "Contract With America," some of them brought to national attention by Ronald Reagan in 1980, some of them brand new. Now the Republicans must make good on those promises or face another voter backlash in 1996. 
 The first thing the G.O.P. can do is make the next two years even more frustrating for President Clinton than the first two were. There is nothing wrong with gridlock if the initiatives that are locked up are wrongheaded. The Clinton health care plan died because it was bad. If majority status helps Senator Bob Dole and Representative Newt Gingrich block such plans more effectively, more gridlock to them.
But what can Republicans accomplish in Washington and in the statehouses they now control?
Tax relief. The Reagan reforms reduced the income tax burdens of people of all classes and took four million low-income Americans off the rolls by raising the standard deduction. The economy boomed and tax revenues went up by a third. But spending rose at a faster rate, while the tax increases mandated by the budget deals of 1990 and 1993, and the upward creep of Social Security taxes, wiped out the cuts. This deepened the Bush recession and weakened the Clinton recovery. Voters expect Republicans to refill the pockets that were picked by Presidents Bush and Clinton, through a combination of spending restraint and 80's-style tax relief.
Electoral reform. This means, primarily, term limits, which are a dumb idea. We already have a term limit system -- elections -- which tossed out a lot of incumbents. But now that the Republicans have promised, they must perform. Should there be campaign spending limits? Oliver North might have liked them in retrospect: they would have saved him from blowing $20 million in a lost cause. The rest of us should take comfort from the fact that elections are not buyable.
Social Security reform. The Democrats resurrected their hoariest scare tactic in the homestretch, charging that the Republicans would cut Social Security. But Social Security is going to hit the wall soon enough anyway, when the baby boomers start leaving the work force for Sun City. The Social Security Administration is predicting that its cash balance will be in deficit by 2013. The conventional-wisdom solution is to tax the benefits of the well-to-do. Better that the Republicans develop a plan that allows people to opt out of Social Security and provide for themselves in the private sector.
Immigration retrenchment. Although an important victory, California's Proposition 187 dealt only with illegal immigrants; legal immigration needs to be cut back, too. Historically, immigration has proceeded in waves of ingestion and digestion, controlled more by upheavals abroad than by laws here. But the world has shrunk to the point where we can no longer count on foreign developments to regulate the flow. We have taken in a huge influx since 1965. Time to chew our cud.
Crime. Republicans at the state level need to do the rethinking on punishment that some Republican governors have done on welfare. Mandatory sentencing ("three strikes and you're out") is a rigid solution; building more prisons is a form of throwing money at the problem. Some measures (such as drug laws) don't belong on the books. But the key is reforming the judiciary -- by appointing judges who will push for expeditious trials and sentencing -- and passing laws to cut down on the appeals process, so as to diminish the gap between arrest and jail.
Some of these points are old G.O.P. standbys; others may strike the new crop of Republicans as marginal. That's all right. The last two years have shown that the Democrats cannot address our problems in new or creative ways. All of Mr. Clinton's talk of New Democrats got swept out with the 1992 campaign buttons. Republicans have a solid foundation, laid in the Reagan years and in this election. Now is their chance to build.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTION: VOTERS;
When Considering Cuomo, Upstate Voters Saw Revenge

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GREECE, N.Y., Nov. 10

 BODY:
The human toll of upstate New York's lingering recession, and the motives for the revenge visited upon Gov. Mario M. Cuomo by its voters this week, can be sensed most mornings in the sun-washed dining room of Buckman's Bakery.
Here in Monroe County, middle-aged men, lured into early retirement as companies like Kodak cut back, while away their mornings over endless cups of coffee, rehashing their theories about life, taxes, politicians and the cure for New York's ills. 
 Taxes have to come down, they say. Government waste has to stop. Crime must be controlled. And the state must stop squandering the hard-earned money of upstate residents on downstate people's problems.
This is, after all, a part of the state where people joke bitterly that it's always New York City people who win the lottery.
"I'm fed up with everything going to the Big Apple," said Tony Grammatico of Greece, a Rochester suburb, who voted against Mr. Cuomo for the first time in 12 years. "They get the biggest piece of the pie for all the social programs."
That was one of the sentiments that echoed resoundingly this week across the upper reaches of New York State, where voters turned out at higher rates, and voted more decisively against Mr. Cuomo, than did voters elsewhere.
Mr. Cuomo focused much of his upstate campaign in traditionally Democratic Erie County, which includes Buffalo. But he lost the county to State Senator George E. Pataki by nearly 40,000 votes. Four years ago, the Governor had outpolled his nearest competitor there by more than 90,000 votes. Over all, his share of the upstate vote -- 62 percent in 1986 and 46 percent in 1990 -- plunged this year to 32 percent.
Taxes, crime and government waste are among the issues cited by upstate voters who rejected Mr. Cuomo. In addition, strategists from both camps have suggested that upstate-downstate sensitivities are such that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's endorsement of Mr. Cuomo may have hurt the Governor more than it helped.
For one thing, Republicans here, to whom the Giuliani endorsement might have been expected to appeal, consider New York City Republicans a different, sometimes suspect breed. And few people in and around cities like Rochester and Syracuse seem to have any doubt that Mr. Cuomo had paid a price for Mr. Giuliani's blessing -- probably, they said, by promising millions of dollars in aid to New York City.
"I think that influenced a lot of people," said Bob Kempen, 49, a Pataki voter and manager of a meat-processing plant in Rochester. "That was something they could understand. Simple. I mean, really, money being funneled to New York City does not appeal to many upstate voters."
Jim Branch, 34, a driver for the United Parcel Service and former Cuomo voter from Rochester who voted for the independent candidate, B. Thomas Golisano, said: "In the back of my mind, I'm thinking, 'O.K., here goes my money. Taxes are going up again. It's coming out of my pocket again.' "
Deal or no deal, interviews with voters in five of the counties that turned against Mr. Cuomo with especial ferocity this week suggested that the main reason for their defection was their feeling that Mr. Cuomo had failed to fix their broken economy.
From Erie County in the far west, through Monroe, Onondaga, Chemung and Broome counties, nearly everyone seemed to know someone who lost their job when their company cut back, their plant closed, their employer moved South.
Judy Gettino, 43, of Liverpool, near Syracuse in Onondaga County, saw her brother move to Florida after the brewery where he worked closed. Mrs. Gettino, who publishes a weekly Pennysaver newspaper with her husband, said she had voted against Mr. Cuomo for the first time since 1982.
Another Pataki voter in the county, Mark Warren, 45, of Pompey, said he had friends who moved to Tennessee when their plant moved South. Ray Shorts, 53, of Greece, identified himself succinctly: "Early retiree from Yellow," he said, referring to Kodak, also known in these parts as the Yellow Father.
Mr. Kempen, the meat-processing manager, said high state workmen's compensation insurance had forced him to shut one plant and lay off 35 people. He said he blamed the state's business climate for his troubles.
"Cuomo has not been effective in dealing with it for 12 years," said Roger W. Boily, a Republican and the town supervisor in Greece. "It isn't just his stand on abortion or the death penalty or Thomas Grasso. It's that this state isn't doing well economically. Something has to be done about it. It's No. 1 in people's minds."
Even his administration's efforts at economic development in the area didn't seem to win Mr. Cuomo many points. Some voters said they appreciated the state support, but others said the projects were misguided or merely pork.
Terry Mehlenbacher, 47, a house builder from Pittsford in Monroe County, suggested Mr. Cuomo's attempt to bail out a troubled salt mine in his town amounted to little more than a taxpayer-supported boondoggle "to assure him more votes."
In Chemung County, Bill McElveney, 63, a former Cuomo voter and owner of Mail Boxes Etc. in Elmira, said the Governor "only came here when a new business opened up. And then he'd shake some hands and take all the credit."
Charles Cleveland, 70, a retired frozen-foods company executive from Manlius in Onondaga County, said the administration had "put up about $10 million to build a frozen-food warehouse here in competition with the company I retired from."
And in Erie County, at a hotel bar in Blasdell, Mike Yoerk, 42, a service station owner, said he was grateful for Mr. Cuomo's support of the minor-league baseball stadium in nearby Buffalo but tired of being nickel-and-dimed on thruway tolls and everything else.
"People are fed up in this area," complained Mr. Yoerk, who voted straight Republican after voting for Mr. Cuomo in the last three elections. "They tax gas, beer, everything. I think 12 years is enough."
While voter turnout in upstate counties, always high, was even higher than usual -- estimated at about 70 percent of registered voters -- some Democrats were sufficiently disgusted that they simply chose not to vote.
Ann Denk, 29, a former Cuomo voter in Greece who works as a sales representative for a toy company, said: "I exercised my right to not vote. I guess I'd sort of soured on him. It's just a gut feeling that he outlasted his usefulness."
Robert W. Lown, 67, a retired maintenance man from Castle Creek, near Binghamton in Broome County, described himself as a Democrat who supported Pataki -- but said he ended up not getting around to voting, for the first time in his life.
Even some of those who got what they wanted this week -- change -- were jaded enough to be taking nothing for granted. Some seemed to doubt, in the end, that their taxes could really be cut and that their lives would significantly change.
Richard Whipple, 52, the president of a medical-imaging company in Orchard Park near Buffalo, and a former Cuomo supporter who voted this time for Mr. Pataki, paused over a bowl of soup and mustered a little cautious optimism.
"We'll give him four years and if he doesn't do it, we'll get rid of the bum," said Mr. Whipple. "I want somebody who will produce. They get into office and they all become politicians."

HEADLINE: So Friendly: Chinese and Christopher

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Nov. 11

 BODY:
What a difference eight months make.
On his last trip to Asia, in March, Secretary of State Warren Christopher verbally battled the Chinese over their human rights record every day of his visit. 
 But that was before the Clinton Administration ended its policy of linking trade benefits to human rights and before a parade of Cabinet secretaries marched into Beijing armed with business contracts and pledges of better relations.
Today Mr. Christopher and the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, looked downright comfortable together as they met on the fringes of a meeting of foreign ministers of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, shaking hands vigorously for the cameras and accentuating the positive.
Their meeting was a prelude to President Clinton's meeting with the Chinese President next week.
In a brief exchange with reporters, Mr. Christopher praised China for what he called its constructive role in the negotiations that led to the nuclear deal between the United States and North Korea, and announced that China would have an important role in carrying it out. He noted that the Chinese had signed a pledge not to export missiles or technology controlled under an international nonproliferation accord.
He also said China had taken some positive steps on human rights, but did not mention the widespread belief within the Administration that the situation has deteriorated in recent months.
"This broad engagement is producing progress on various fronts," Mr. Christopher said.
Perhaps to reassure Mr. Qian of American constancy, Mr. Christopher brushed aside a question that the Administration might find it more difficult to execute its policy of engagement with a Republican-dominated Congress.
When asked about the election, Mr. Qian, whose Government has accused the American Congress of meddling in China's affairs in the past, politely deferred to Mr. Christopher. "I believe the election of the U.S. Congress is the entitlement of the United States," he said. "Therefore, I consider that question directed to Mr. Christopher."
But in their private meeting, Mr. Qian stepped out of character. He told Mr. Christopher that he appreciated his words about continuity in foreign policy during his formal speech to the forum. "We're interested and concerned to know how the election affects us," a senior State Department official quoted Mr. Qian as saying.
In a way the remark was not surprising. The two foreign policy committees in Congress will be headed by men who are sworn enemies of Beijing: Senator Jesse Helms, who favors independence for Taiwan and demonizes the Chinese military, and Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, who considers himself a close friend of the Dalai Lama of Tibet.
The cozy atmosphere between Mr. Christopher and Mr. Qian did not mean that there were no issues dividing them. Mr. Christopher raised the matter of China's refusal to accept revisions and updates of an international accord controlling missile exports or to disclose what missile technology it shipped abroad before it agreed to abide by the accord. He also told Mr. Qian that the United States would like China to make more progress in improving its human rights record.
Human rights in Indonesia was one of the themes discussed today by Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative. He announced an agreement with Indonesia on the rights of workers, a source of tension between Washington and Jakarta. Among the accord's provisions are vague pledges by Indonesia to amend its labor laws and regulations and to make the Government-run All Independent Worker Union more independent.
Early last year, Mr. Kantor suspended a formal review of whether Indonesia deserved certain trade benefits despite its poor record on workers' rights.
In analyzing Indonesia's human rights record at the time, Mr. Kantor noted the overwhelming role of the military and the absence of free association in the workplace.
But neither of these issues was addressed in today's accord. Mike Jendrzejczyk, the Washington director of the human rights organizationAsia Watch, said: "For any labor accord to be meaningful, it would have to allow truly independent labor organizations to emerge and curb the pervasive role of the military."
Mr. Kantor acknowledged that the agreement had its limitations, telling reporters even as he touted it that it was only "a step in the proper direction."

HEADLINE: U.S. Supports Asia-Pacific Free Trade, but Questions Timing

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Saturday, Nov. 12

 BODY:
A meeting of representatives from 18 countries on both sides of the Pacific Ocean opened on Friday with signs that the United States had reservations about how rapidly different countries should move toward achieving free trade across the region.
The central question at the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which continued through this morning, was whether the 18 member countries would agree to lower trade barriers by the proposed date of 2020. The United States is a big backer of the free trade proposals and of the 2020 deadline. 
 But Washington has expressed some reluctance about part of the proposal that would require industrial countries to eliminate trade barriers 10 years earlier than the developing countries, according to two Asian officials.
Viewed from Asia, Washington's concerns are political. Asian officials say that the United States is worried that certain American industries will be unhappy if American markets are opened to imports from the fast-growing East Asian nations a decade before those nations fully open their markets to American products.
Arousing opponents of free trade in the United States could, in turn, also make it harder for the Administration to win Congressional approval of the world trade knows as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
The United States appears to be the only country unwilling to accept the target date of 2010 for the advanced nations, Asian officials said.
Still, it is not clear whether the United States will press its case because doing so could make developing nations less supportive of the overall trade goal. The proposed 10-year difference is intended to make the trade agreement more palatable to developing nations by giving them extra time to improve their industries before subjecting them to foreign competition.
At a news briefing on Friday, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said there might have to be some difference in the dates for the developing and developed nations. But he avoided expressing support for the 2010 target.
"There's general agreement that, of course, the developed countries and the newly industrialized countries have a greater ability to meet certain standards earlier than maybe developing countries," he said. "However, particular dates have not been discussed.
"The fact is, I think that there is general consensus that the year 2020 should be a goal and vision for achieving free trade in the region."
The meetings began on Friday with a speech by President Suharto of Indonesia at the state palace, urging the delegates to "maintain the momentum" toward free trade. In Indonesian tradition, he then banged a gong to declare the meeting in session.
Among the actions taken at the first session was approval of a nonbinding code governing foreign investment. Agreement was reached late Thursday in a compromise between the United States, which wanted stronger language guaranteeing fair treatment to foreign investors, and the other 17 nations.
Officials said that meeting of the ministers, which was behind closed doors, was cordial. "We are quite pleased with the progress we have been able to achieve," Ali Alatas, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, said at a news conference. "The atmosphere was good throughout."
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in a speech proposing new initiatives for Asia and the Pacific, departed from his prepared text to assure the delegates that there would be continuity in American foreign policy despite the crushing losses suffered by the Democratic Party in the elections on Tuesday.
"That's a subject that's clearly been on the minds of many of the people we met here today," a State Department spokesman said.
One of the big questions here is whether the election setback will undermine President Clinton's effectiveness at the APEC summit meeting, which will take place on Tuesday in Bogor, outside Jakarta. At last year's meeting in Seattle, the President was the commanding figure and played a major role in expanding the scope and ambitions of the organization.
Some people who attended the meetings today and Friday said there was consensus building toward the target date of 2020 for achieving free trade in the region, although Malaysia still appears to be against the idea.
China seemed to support a timetable as long as it was flexible. "As the levels of economic development of APEC members are widely different, we support President Suharto's proposal that the timetable be drawn up in the light of the diverse conditions," Qian Qichen, China's Vice Premier and Foreign Minister, said.
But in a separate meeting with Mr. Christopher, Mr. Qian said China should not be asked to approve the Asia-Pacific free trade plan unless it was allowed to join GATT, according to Winston Lord, United States Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. "That's sort of apples and oranges as far as we're concerned," Mr. Lord said.

CLINTON LEAVES FOR ASIA
 WASHINGTON, Nov. 11 (AP) -- President Clinton set out on Friday for Asia suggesting that the trade talks could help bring prosperity to dissatisfied Americans.
"We simply must turn insecurity about our future into confidence," Mr. Clinton told reporters before he left. "The ultimate goal is to produce a strong America."
After a stop in Alaska to speak to members of the military, Mr. Clinton plans a two-day visit to the Philippines before attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Indonesia.
In Manila he is to meet with President Fidel Ramos, visit World War II battle sites and discuss trade issuew with American business executives.

HEADLINE: With Thai Rebuff, U.S. Defers Plan for Navy Depot in Asia

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Nov. 11

 BODY:
The United States has put on hold a proposal to build a floating war depot in Southeast Asia that would strengthen American military readiness in both Asia and the Middle East, senior United States military officials said today.
The plan was frozen, at least for the moment, after Thailand rejected a proposal last month to base a flotilla of up to six supply ships permanently in the Gulf of Thailand. 
 Since then senior officials in Malaysia and Indonesia have indicated publicly that they would also reject any proposal to position United States ships off their coasts.
"The plan of where the ships are going to go is on hold," said a senior American military official involved in formulating it. But the official emphasized that "the plan is not dead in the water -- it's being looked at again."
The rebuff by Thailand follows a decision by Saudi Arabia last month to refuse a United States request to base enough tanks and planes on Saudi soil to support a brigade of troops.
The United States wants to position the flotilla permanently in Asia to augment its eight-ship flotillas in Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean and in Guam in the Western Pacific. Such pre-positioning, as it is called, gives the military much-needed flexibility, so that if troops are flown quickly to a crisis in the Middle East or Asia, the tanks, heavy artillery, ammunition, fuel, food and medical supplies to support them will already be in place.
After the Persian Gulf war of 1991, which began more than four months after Iraq invaded Kuwait, a Pentagon study on mobility concluded that the shipment of weapons and other equipment took too long and recommended that the United States seek offshore bases in Southeast Asia.
So far the United States Pacific Command, which is based in Hawaii and has responsibility for Asia, has failed to come up with an alternative location because military planners disagree on what country to approach, senior officials said.
President Clinton first proposed anchoring a flotilla in the Gulf of Thailand at a meeting in September at the White House with the Thai Prime Minister, Chuan Likphai.
Thailand, a close United States ally, initially indicated a willingness to allow the ships to use its refueling and repair installations, and the United States hoped to send the first ships by the end of the year.
The flotilla would be able to sustain up to one heavy brigade or one armored cavalry regiment for at least 15 days.
But after the plan was attacked both within and outside the coalition Government as an infringement of Thai sovereignty, Thailand rejected the proposal, saying the arrangement might strain relations with China, Vietnam, Cambodia and Burma.
There was another factor: Thai military officials were upset by passage of the 1995 Foreign Operations Act, which included a provision to cut off military training aid and education to Thailand because of its apparent support for the Communist Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
The rebuff will complicate Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to Thailand next week after the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting here.
The United States has not approached any other government with the proposal, and no other government has rejected the plan in advance, a senior Administration official said.
But in an interview today, Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, said his country would not be interested because of its policy of nonalignment. "America knows full well it would be against our nonaligned policy, so I don't think they'll come to us," Mr. Alatas said. "I don't know what the purpose of these ships is, but it's very interesting that even Thailand said no."
Malaysia's Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, has said such an arrangement could contribute to regional hostility.
It is questionable whether Singapore would agree to play host to the ships if its neighbors said no to the United States. The Philippines, which closed the last American military base on its territory two years ago, might also be reluctant to allow what inevitably would be perceived as a floating base.

A LAST RESORT IS NOW PART OF THE SYSTEM
On many nights hundreds of people continue to take refuge in the city's after-hours homeless office in the Bronx, where straight-back plastic chairs or a plot of dirty floor are luxuries for the weary. The spectacle has become such a fixture that the city has budgeted $5 million to cover fines it owes to families dating back to 1991 and penalties it expects to pay through the end of year. And beginning next week, families left overnight in the office will be eligible for a $50 penalty payment the first night and $100 payment for each successive night. Page 1.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTION: WHITE HOUSE MEMO;
In Defeat, Clinton Aides Find Their Silver Lining

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11

 BODY:
In the Pennsylvania Avenue home of the Comeback Kid, the talk to reporters since Tuesday has been about rising again from the canvas and rolling the stone back up the hill.
"Remember, this is a resilient President," one staff member said. 
 So the central question among White House aides now is how Bill Clinton recovers from the 40-story fall that his political fortunes took on Tuesday evening. Not whether. How.
"The consensus, it's fair to say, is that he's going to be re-elected," one confident and quite senior Administration official said today.
"There's no reason to panic," said Tony Coelho, the former House member and Democratic Party strategist. "Be patient. Wait for the opportunities, because they surely will come."
In a White House famed for its relentless powers of positive thinking, a sunny face is the standard reaction to any disaster. But the optimism voiced by Clinton aides, however surprising, appears to be more than spin deep.
To some, including some Democrats, such statements are acts of denial. In their view, Tuesday's vote was a resounding rejection of the Democratic philosophy of governing, writ large, and of a President who promised to change that culture and is seen as having failed.
Within the White House and adjacent party councils, there are those who very nearly see the Democratic whipping as a positive force. Like many impartial analysts, they were convinced that the Republicans would capture the House of Representatives within one or two elections anyway. Moreover, the current Democratic margin was so thin as to make it difficult for the President to push the rest of his domestic agenda into law.
In their view, losing Congress shifts some of the hard choices of governing to their opponents, and gives the White House a definable enemy to campaign against.
Just as important, it concentrates their minds on two problems that many of them see as Mr. Clinton's greatest political liabilities: his failure to give citizens a clear, consistent explanation of his goals, and the widespread belief that he is weak, that he can be rolled.
The two are related, because each time Mr. Clinton has switched sides on an issue, he has muddled voters' impressions of his Administration and of his own strength. White House officials now have two years to fix matters up, with the certainty that he and they will be on the street if they do not.
Senior officials and party strategists who have talked with them said in interviews this week that despite pledges of cooperation, the President is far from choosing a strategy to deal with a Republican Congress. And the House Speaker-designate, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, has already said he will give Mr. Clinton no quarter on the issues he holds dear.
"After every one of these elections, there's lip service given to bipartisanship from both sides," one White House political adviser said. "I think there'll have to be assessments later on."
For the moment, people inside and outside the Administration say, Mr. Clinton's advisers have loosely organized themselves into two schools of thought. One, which one strategist called the conciliators, believes the President should cast himself more directly in the center of the political spectrum by cooperating with moderates of both parties.
Its advocates would press for compromises on issues where both parties have room to agree, like welfare reform and shrinking the Federal Government and its budget, and to answer the voters' clear demand that the Government stop bickering and get something done.
They also argue that Mr. Clinton should speak out more often about values issues, like crime and teen-age pregnancy, on which he has proven himself a compelling orator and on which his views have broad appeal.
Those views are close to the new Democrat thinking that the President campaigned on and that moderates in his party have long supported. Among its proponents are Erskine Bowles, a former head of the Small Business Administration who is a new deputy to White House chief of staff Leon E. Panetta, and Rahm Emanuel, a Clinton aide who was a fund-raiser for the Democratic Party and Mr. Clinton.
The other school of political strategy is not far removed, but is more aggressive. Its advocates would press Mr. Clinton to "fight and assert and re-establish why he's here," in one Administration official's words. That school would push for more programs, including but not limited to education and worker training, to address what its proponents see as Americans' real political ulcer: uncertainty about the economy and their own future.
The advocates are said to include Mr. Panetta's other deputy, Harold M. Ickes, and aides like George Stephanopoulos and Labor Secretary Robert Reich. Mr. Clinton campaigned to shift Government spending to address exactly those concerns, and he is said to prize such programs more than most of his initiatives.
But Republicans would almost certainly oppose them, and the strategy would mean a more contentious relationship with Congress, and more of the gridlock that voters seem to detest. Some advisers say it is worth the fight for Mr. Clinton to be seen as standing firm for the little guy, and good politics to boot.
"On the question of who hates Government more, and who wants to cut it more, Republicans will always win," one official said.
Either strategy, that of confirmed moderate or feisty populist, would give Mr. Clinton a consistent image he so far seems to have lacked. And either would presumably make him look stronger, either by enacting legislation or by exercising a veto power that he so far has not had to use.

Stocks declined as traders awaited the next move by the Federal Reserve. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 2 points, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.26 points. [40.]
Sugar prices surged after the Agriculture Department lowered its forecast for world production. Orange juice prices rose. [48.]
 
The dollar ended little changed in quiet trading. The Swedish krona rose against the mark and the dollar ahead of a referendum on whether Sweden should join the European Union. [48.]
 
The Treasury cash market was closed in observance of Veterans Day. Futures trading was limited. [49.]
 
 
Your Money
 
What does the Republicans' election sweep mean for taxpayers? The proposals in the Contract With America, the Republican action plan, provide some clues, tax and investment professionals say. The proposals include cutting the capital gains tax in half, phasing out the 1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits and creating a new type of individual retirement account. [35.]
 
Health care stocks have surged since the end of a drive to overhaul the nation's health care system, to the benefit of mutual funds that invest in such stocks. [35.]
 
Americans are paying real estate agents too much, the Consumer Federation of America argues. Home sellers should negotiate with agents over commissions, the federation says. [35.]
 
Many investment clubs collapse in the early going. Some of the hallmarks of surviving clubs, surveys show, are close links among members and an egalitarian approach. [36.]

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTION: THE MAYOR;
Giuliani Tries to End Feud, But His Phone Isn't Ringing

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani called his fellow Republicans petty, ungracious and dangerously overconfident yesterday for the retaliation they are inflicting on him for supporting Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, and he warned them that if in trying to punish him, they hurt New York City, they would only hurt themselves, too.
 Still feeling the stings of retribution for his stunning -- and, in hindsight, inopportune -- decision to endorse the Democratic Governor, Mr. Giuliani appeared to be shoring up his weakened political position and trying to send a message that the city's interests could not be ignored. 
 "Boy, they shouldn't make any mistake of the fact that I can be very, very outspoken and still have the opportunity to fight back very, very hard for New York City," he said. "If they try to hurt New York, they're not only going to be having to hear from me, but also all of the people that care about New York City."
 Speaking in turn about Governor-elect George E. Pataki, the Republican National Committee and, by implication, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Mr. Giuliani urged -- or perhaps pleaded -- that they put the divisive campaign behind them and work with him for the good of the city and state.
 Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that the Republican National Committee had displayed "the pettiest kind of partisan politics" by deciding not to consider holding its 1996 convention in the city -- a decision the committee chairman, Haley Barbour, made a point of disclosing on Thursday, though many in the party doubted New York was a likely choice even before Mr. Giuliani broke ranks.
 After seeming uncharacteristically chastened in the wake of Tuesday's election, Mr. Giuliani also lashed out at Mr. Pataki, saying that he would hurt the economy of the whole state if he favored other regions at the expense of the city. And he suggested that the Governor-elect had acted ungraciously for still refusing, three days after Election Day, to return his phone calls.
 "Once an election is over with, my goodness -- it's enough having to go through it during election time," Mr. Giuliani said in a radio interview on WCBS-AM (880), trying to move past the bitter tone of the campaign, when he traded barbs with Mr. Pataki and his patron, Mr. D'Amato. "The very next moment you should get over it and then not worry about that stuff for four years. If they carry on this partisan stuff, they're going to hurt themselves."
 Still, the retributions have come.
 Mr. Pataki departed yesterday for a weekend vacation with his family, and a spokeswoman, Caroline Quartararo, said he would put aside discussions of budget policies or other transition issues until he returned on Tuesday. That would appear to mean the Mayor should not wait by the phone.
 And Senator D'Amato, the Mayor's now and again bitterest rival, offered a double-edged pledge on Thursday not to hold Mr. Giuliani's attacks against him. "I'm not going to squish him," he told Don Imus on his morning radio show on WFAN-AM (660). "He's going to squish himself. You leave the bug alone unless the bug is biting."
 The sniping between Mr. Giuliani and the state's other most prominent Republicans, Mr. Pataki and Mr. D'Amato, showed that the nastiness of the campaign would linger for at least a while. And the Mayor's pointed counterattacks raised questions about whether they could work together or whether their feud would spill into policy decisions affecting the city, which has more than 40 percent of the state's 18 million residents, once Mr. Pataki takes over as the first Republican governor in 24 years.
 Since election night, Mr. Pataki has reiterated his campaign pledge to enact a 25 percent cut in income taxes over the next four years -- a plan Mr. Giuliani derided as "phony" during the campaign. But he has offered scant details on how he would cut spending to cover a $5.6 billion cut in tax revenues or how he would close a $4 billion shortfall Mr. Cuomo's office has now projected in next year's state budget.
 The feuding, however, may have already had an economic impact on the city. Mr. Giuliani has estimated that playing host to the Republican convention in 1996 could have added $100 million to the city's coffers. That evaporated with Mr. Barbour's announcement that the convention would now be held in either New Orleans, San Diego or San Antonio -- in spite of the Mayor's attempts to woo the site selection committee, going so far as to promise to ride an elephant into Madison Square Garden if need be.
 Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani said the decision was "a lost opportunity" for the G.O.P. to showcase a new urban agenda on issues like crime and fiscal conservatism that he has made the priorities of his mayoralty. "This is something that would be good for the Republican Party," he said, "and here they're turning it down to make some petty point."
 Mr. Giuliani also had a message for the new Congress, saying it would be foolhardy for Republicans to not address the concerns of cities. And in apparent reference to Mr. D'Amato, who is in line to become the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, he issued a caution to those who were "feeling extra powerful."
 Speaking to reporters after marching in the Veterans Day Parade in Manhattan, he said, "People make the most mistakes sometimes when they feel too powerful and too strong and that they are kind of, like, on top of the world."
 If the feud continues, Mr. Giuliani might find the Democrats his strongest allies in Albany, particularly the Speaker of the Assembly, Sheldon Silver, who represents the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
 Mr. Silver said yesterday that he expected that the new governor would recognize the importance of New York to the state's economy and reach out to it even though its voters went overwhelmingly for Mr. Cuomo.
 "I think George Pataki is smart enough to realize that, whatever internal squabbling exists, New York City is an important factor in the state," he said.
 The Mayor's budget director, Abraham M. Lackman, also downplayed the likelihood that Mr. Pataki's plans would single out the city's budget -- even though Mr. Giuliani hopes to receive millions of dollars in new aid to help close a $1.1 billion gap that has opened in the city's $31.6 billion budget.
 "There are no 'just New York City' spending programs in the state budget," said Mr. Lackman, who worked for the Republicans who control the State Senate before joining the Giuliani administration.
 He compared the state's budget to a marble cake, where the flavors and colors are mixed, saying, "When you take a slice from it, you're not taking a slice from one specific part."

Europe's Insulation Market Is Target of Owens-Corning

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: VISE, Belgium

 BODY:
The Pink Panther is coming.
 The Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation, the largest manufacturer of insulation in the world, is using its cartoon mascot to spearhead an assault on Europe's $75 billion home improvement market. 
 To win the consumer hardware wars here, the company will have to make inroads into a European culture that can be indifferent to aggressive marketing, initially unresponsive to America's do-it-yourself revolution and unacquainted with the most hyper of American institutions, the hardware hyperstore.
 Winning hearts and minds of European consumers is not going to be easy. Owens-Corning is the dominant player in insulation in North America, with a 60 percent market share of insulation sales. But so far, the company, which has a plant in this town two miles from the Dutch border, accounts for only 15 percent of the market in Europe, where the major player is the French company Saint-Gobain.
 Owens-Corning, based in Toledo, Ohio, was the first company to trademark a color -- pink, back in 1987, for its insulation material. The Pink Panther, the rascally cartoon character, was licensed last August to help promote the company's insulation products worldwide.
 It cost $150 million for Owens-Corning to introduce Pink Panther insulation to the United States, and analysts estimate it could ultimately cost as much in Europe. But Owens-Corning, which had total sales of $3.2 billion last year, has picked Europe as a place to make major inroads into the $250 billion worldwide home improvement market.
 The Pink Panther is but one element of the most sweeping brand-name transformation in the company's international operations, one that will make Owens-Corning itself a worldwide brand. Until now, the company marketed its building-materials products under a variety of names in Europe, including Thermolan, Crown, Dritherm and Rocksill.
 Many a brand introduction has turned on the unpredictability of foreign markets. Pepsico even had to take the cheese out of Cheetos to introduce the snack food to China. In this case the symbol for Owens-Corning is associated with Hollywood's bumbling French detective, Inspector Jacques Clouseau, and a sendup of things European.
 "Our preliminary research shows no negatives with the Pink Panther," said Nina Fiorenza, the company's European marketing and communications director.
 But Karen Strauss, the Owens-Corning director of corporate branding programs, added: "We are going to do some formidable research to make sure. We don't want to slam-dunk American ideas and practices on a different culture and a different way of doing business."
 Warren Knowlton, president of the Owens-Corning building-products division in Europe, said the insulation market "cannot fail to grow" there. "Governments everywhere are demanding more energy conservation and pollution control," he said in an interview in Vise.
 In the United States, insulation has been a staple of hardware supermarkets. In Europe, though, insulation is largely sold by so-called builders' merchants, who had traditionally catered to contractors but now sell retail to the public.
 In its unaccustomed European role as the little guy, Owens-Corning makes do with a small sales and support staff. But the company "needs to make a major investment in marketing and manpower if they're going to make it here," said Willi Philippeth, a builders' merchant who owns Isolem, a wholesale and retail operation in Limburg, Belgium.
 Jos Peeters, a sales representative for Isolem, said suppliers "won't care a bit about the color pink, or the Pink Panther." "But," he added, "it could be a selling point for home consumers."
 The manufacturing center of the new Owens-Corning marketing push will be the insulation plant in Vise. With the factory's output sold out for the last four years, Owens-Corning plans to construct another production line at a cost of $40 million. The expansion will increase capacity by 60 percent and will have the capability to spray the insulation trademark-pink. Although there is a risk of a consumer backlash against an aggressive campaign by an American multinational, Mr. Philippeth said many Belgians thought of the Owens-Corning operation as economically beneficial, since the company has 1,300 employees in Europe.
 In most of Europe, insulation products are relegated to a corner of the large hardware chains. That's the configuration in the G. B. Brico store in Tongeren, a picture-postcard town 20 minutes from Vise.
 "We sell only 300 to 400 rolls of insulation each fall," said Guido Van Hacht, the store's assistant manager. "But we would carry Owens-Corning if we were supplied with it."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTION: THE TRANSITION;
Looming Budget Gap Was No Surprise, Cuomo Tells Pataki

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 11

 BODY:
Responding to criticism from Governor-elect George E. Pataki about a projected $4 billion budget gap, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo told Mr. Pataki on the phone this morning that the shortfall should have come as no surprise.
 Cuomo administration officials, meanwhile, went a step further, issuing a statement to outline the shortfall and suggesting that if Mr. Pataki had done his homework before promising a 25 percent cut in personal income taxes over four years, he would have realized that there was a problem. 
 "All these developments were public knowledge," Rudy Runko, Mr. Cuomo's budget director, said in the statement. "That is why so many private economists said Governor-elect Pataki's proposed tax cut was unaffordable."
 But a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki said that Mr. Cuomo had either hidden the numbers or had not made them widely available during the campaign. "How could he have known about these numbers when they were not released until after the election?" said the spokeswoman, Caroline Quartararo. "Why didn't the Cuomo administration take steps to correct the problem?"
 Three days after the election, campaign bickering continued even though the two principals were out of the public eye. Mr. Cuomo again spent the day in the Executive Mansion taking calls; Mr. Pataki left his home in Garrison for a weekend vacation, his destination a secret. He is expected back to work on Tuesday, Ms. Quartararo said.
 Much of the political speculation in the capital today centered on the person who is now the second most powerful Republican in state government, the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino of Oyster Bay.
 Mr. Marino's hold on power seemed vulnerable after Mr. Pataki won, because he tried to block the Governor-elect's candidacy this spring. United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Mr. Pataki's most potent patron, promised several times during the campaign to unseat Mr. Marino from leadership.
 But today, one of the people most often mentioned as a challenger to Mr. Marino, State Senator Joseph L. Bruno, Republican of Saratoga Springs, said he had no immediate plans to try to topple Mr. Marino.
 "I support the majority leader at this time," said Mr. Bruno, who is close to Mr. Pataki, Mr. D'Amato and the Republican State Committee leaders. "If and when a vacancy occurs in the Senate leadership, I will make my judgment then as to what will be in my best interest and that of the majority conference."
 Though a challenge remains distinctly possible, several key senators said privately this week that Mr. Marino seemed secure for the moment. Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Westchester Republican who some observers also mentioned as a possible challenger, said Mr. Pataki had told him recently he did not wish to push Mr. Marino from power at this time.
 "My own opinion is that George Pataki will have his hands full governing the state, especially in light of the fact that we are looking at a $4 billion deficit," said Mr. Spano, who denied any immediate ambitions to the seat. "I don't think this is an additional burden he would take on."
 It was unclear who initiated the phone call between Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Pataki, but a Cuomo aide said the Governor had told Mr. Pataki that the gap was only a prediction, and that such projected gaps open every year and are corrected through spending cuts. He also told Mr. Pataki that the size of the gap had been the main problem with passing the budget this year, and had been public knowledge long before Election Day, the aide said.
 "The Governor said to him, 'I'm just surprised that you would express surprise about something that was discussed so much,' " said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
 According to Mr. Runko's statement, the budget Mr. Cuomo presented for this fiscal year was balanced but left a projected gap for next year of $1.43 billion. In June, the Legislature enacted a budget with more spending and deeper tax cuts than the Governor proposed, though he signed this budget into law. The tax cuts and extra spending added $1.63 billion to the projected gap, Mr. Runko said.
 A slackening of revenue will mean an additional loss of $500 million next year, and Mr. Runko also cited greater projected costs for prisons and higher interest rates on state debt.
 Mr. Cuomo also urged Mr. Pataki not to dismiss out of hand his proposal for a state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, saying it was not simply an empty campaign promise.

HEADLINE: Dr. Robert Henry Strotz, 72, Chief of Northwestern University

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Dr. Robert Henry Strotz, an expert in economic theory and econometrics who served as president of Northwestern University from 1970 to 1985, died on Wednesday in a nursing home in Deerfield, Ill. A resident of Wilmette, Ill., he was 72.
 He had suffered a long illness, the university reported. 
 During Dr. Strotz's tenure, Northwestern experienced continued faculty and student growth and made capital improvements of more than $142 million, the university said.
 After his retirement as president, Dr. Strotz became university chancellor and remained in that post until 1990. As chancellor he acted primarily as a fund-raiser and liaison to alumni.
 Born in Aurora, Ill., he graduated from the University of Chicago, where he earned his doctorate in 1951 with a thesis on welfare economics. He studied econometrics at research centers in England, the Netherlands and Sweden.
 In World War II he put his studies on hold while he served with the Army in Europe.
 He joined the faculty of Northwestern in Evanston, Ill., in 1947 and became a professor in the department of economics by 1958. From 1966 until 1970 he served as dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.
 Before becoming president, he was the author or co-author of books and many articles on business investment and many other subjects. He was a former editor of Econometrica, the quarterly of the Econometric Society, associate editor of the International Economic Review and editor of Contributions to Economic Analysis.
 He is survived by his wife, Margaret Hanley Strotz; four daughters, Vicki Rhodes of Madison, Wis., Frances Strotz of Waukegan, Ill., Ellen Macieiski of Danville, Ill., and Ann Pence of Kasilaf, Alaska; a son, Michael of Winnetka, Ill.; a brother, Loren of Aurora; three stepdaughters, Katie Hanley and Elizabeth Hughes of Evanston and Marcia Hoover of Seattle, and 13 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTION: THE VOTERS;
Religious-Right Candidates Gain as G.O.P. Turnout Rises

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11

 BODY:
Candidates aligned with conservative religious groups scored major gains on Tuesday in an election in which turnout increased among Republicans in every region of the country, two surveys showed today.
A study by People for the American Way, a group that calls itself "a voice against intolerance," found that 60 percent of the 600 candidates for national, state and local offices who were supported by religious conservatives won their elections. 
 Arthur J. Kropp, president of the group, said the gains would significantly increase the influence of religious conservatives in American politics. "More politicians than ever owe their jobs to the organizing and financial support supplied by religious-right groups," he said, adding that "their expectation is that the right-wing agenda will receive top priority in the next two years."
Still, some high-profile candidates affiliated with religious conservatives, like Oliver L. North, who ran for Senate from Virginia, were defeated. In Oregon and Idaho, statewide initiatives to limit protections for gay people, which had been supported by many religious conservatives, also lost.
But Ralph Reed, executive director of the Christian Coalition, said the involvement of greater numbers of religious conservatives and the success of candidates they supported represented "a sea change in American politics."
About 75 million Americans cast ballots for the Tuesday election but many more than that who were eligible did not vote, according to a second study, announced today by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, a nonpartisan group here.
Turnout was estimated by the study at 38.7 percent of eligible voters, an increase of 2.2 percentage points from four years ago. The turnout was the highest for any midterm election since the recession year of 1982, but it was well below the levels in the 20 years ending in 1970.
The study, based on final, unofficial returns reported by the News Election Service, which tabulates election results for television networks and wire services, found that Republican turnout nationally exceeded Democratic turnout for the first time in a midterm election since 1970.
Turnout was up in all regions of the country except New England and the farming portion of the Midwest, and Republican turnout increased in every region. Democratic turnout, however, declined in every region except the Middle Atlantic states. There were huge increases in turnout in Tennessee and Virginia and substantial increases in New York, Maryland, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas and Florida, perhaps because the elections in those states were so hotly contested.

HEADLINE: Issues of Race and Pollution Trouble L.I. Town

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW CASSEL, L.I.

 BODY:
For years, residents of this predominantly black and Hispanic working-class community have held their noses, shut their windows and tried hard not to dwell on the smells and the unsightliness of the 170-acre industrial site just across the railroad tracks.
 The putrid odors from the chemical plants and garbage-transfer stations and fish processing factories make some people sick. But they are so taken for granted in New Cassel, directly downwind of the plants, that few residents lodge complaints. In fact, Nassau County health officials say, a vast majority of complaints have come from wealthier, primarily white communities upwind of the plants like Salisbury and South Westbury, where the smells are not nearly so intense. 
 But now, the people of New Cassel are suddenly transfixed by the sources of the odors. A recent report by a public-interest research group detailed several environmental hazards, from air pollution to toxic waste to groundwater contamination, in the industrial area, and revealed what many residents say they had not known: Since 1988 their suburb's industrial zone has been on the state's Superfund list, awaiting cleanup.
 John Addison, president of a New Cassell citizens group, the Progressive Civic Association, said the information in the report, gleaned from the state's own documents, stunned him. "I was awestruck by the literature," he said. "We never as a community acknowledged with any understanding how serious the issue could be. We've been in the dark for years."
 The report, prepared by the New York Public Interest Research Group, criticized state environmental officials for failing to inform residents of the potential hazards at their doorsteps and for not taking quick action against the polluters. This has angered the community's civic leaders, who think that the slowness of the cleanup reflects New Cassel's second-class status in a predominantly white, suburban county. But the report has also inspired introspection among the community's leaders, who have begun to wonder if the apathy of New Cassel's residents also contributed to the state's slow response.
 "I have to say, I feel that it's because we're African-Americans here," Mildred Little said, explaining why she thinks there has been no cleanup. But Ms. Little, who has lived in New Cassel since 1957 and serves on the Town of North Hempstead's zoning board, also said it is difficult to get residents to protest, because many feel so disenfranchised. "A lot of people do not speak up," she said.
 A growing number of minority groups across the country have been arguing that when it comes to living in areas contaminated with industrial pollution, black, Hispanic and American Indian communities bear a disproportionate share of the burden. Last year, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency reported that higher percentages of blacks and Hispanics than whites lived in areas polluted by dust, soot, carbon monoxide, ozone and emissions from hazardous waste dumps.
 Environmental groups say some studies have shown hazardous waste sites in white and wealthier communities are attended to more quickly by the Government than those in minority and poorer communities. Patricia Williams, counsel on solid and hazardous wastes for the National Wildlife Federation, said low-income and minority communities lack the political and economic influence to get swift action.
 "You have poor communities that are not necessarily focused upon," Ms. Williams said. "They aren't the fund raisers, they aren't the people with the PAC's. They're not on the front lines of attention."
 State environmental officials deny that they have dragged their feet on the New Cassel site. Although the state first designated it as a Class 2 hazardous waste site -- meaning that it presented a "significant threat to the public health and environment" -- in 1988, officials say the complexity of finding the source of the contamination has prolonged the investigation of the New Cassel industrial area, one of 570 Class 2 sites in the state.
 Chemicals found underground at the site have been identified as trichloroethane and tetrachloroethane, degreasers used by many of the dozens of companies in the industrial zone. The problem, officials say, is trying to determine which of the 129 properties in the zone is the source.
 "This is not a typical site where you have one industry and one owner," said Michael O'Toole, director of the Division of Hazardous Waste Remediation for the State Department of Environmental Conservation. "Under the state's Superfund law, we can't use Superfund money unless we make efforts to identify the responsible parties."
 Last year, the department hired an environmental consultant to determine the origins of the underground concentrations of pollution. A draft report identifying several of the concentrations is to be submitted by the consultant this month and released to the public in December, Mr. O'Toole said.
 So far, the state has spent $250,000 on the New Cassel investigation, he added.
 But what troubles residents like Mr. Addison, a mortgage banker who was raised in New Cassel and moved back here with his family a decade ago, is that until the report by the New York Public Interest Research Group, he knew nothing about the extent of the problem. He is not sure who is at fault: the state for not doing a better job of spreading the news, or the community, for not doing a better job of looking after itself.
 Still, Mr. Addison said, New Cassel is at a severe disadvantage in trying to protect its interests. According to the 1990 Census, the per-capita income in the hamlet, where 66 percent of the 10,200 residents are black and 20 percent are Hispanic, is $12,918. That is about half the Nassau County average and about one-third less than the state average.
 The economic and social pressures of daily life in New Cassel leave its residents little time to consider the long-terms health effects of what might be produced in the industrial area, Mr. Addison said: "We've always been the community that is last to know. It's almost like being punched in the arm too much. You come to accept the pain."
 Ludovic Blain, who prepared the 54-page report for the New York research group, said New Cassel's experience fits a pattern for several minority communities around the state that are near industrial and hazardous waste sites, including Wyandanch on the Island and a black neighborhood in Albany. Whether the phenomenon -- and the Government's response to it -- is evidence of racism or lack of influence is a matter of conjecture, he said.
 "It's difficult to prove," Mr. Blain said. "But just like when a car hits you, the intent is secondary as far as you are concerned. The issue here is whether these communities can control the character of their neighborhood, and get the resources to make that happen."
 In recent weeks, meetings organized by Ms. Little and the public interest group in New Cassel's community center have drawn dozens of residents as well as the area's representatives in Albany. What residents would like, Ms. Little said, is for the state to hire a local ombudsman, someone from the community who could insure that residents are apprised of what is happening in the industrial area, and keep the pressure on environmental officials to pursue the cleanup.
 Mr. Addison said he was skeptical that the state's indifference to New Cassel would change. The only time he ever sees politicians, he said, is before Election Day. "The political atmosphere is, 'Here in September, gone in November,' " he said with a sigh.

HEADLINE: Only Futures Are Traded In Treasury Bond Market

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Futures trading in an abbreviated session was the only activity yesterday in the Government securities market, with the cash market closed in observance of Veterans Day.
 Traders said the price of the December contract for a 30-year Treasury bond finished down 17/32 , at 962/32 . David Ging, manager of MMS Treasury Technical in Chicago, said that the equivalent price in the cash market was 9210/32 or slightly more, for a yield of 8.19 percent. 
 Mr. Ging said, "If the overseas markets do nothing ahead of Monday's opening of the U.S. market, this is the yield investors will be looking at in the morning."
 Yesterday's futures trading underlined the bearish tone of the bond market, Mr. Ging added. "One thing interesting to note was that the low for the current futures market was 961/32 on Monday, and yesterday that low was tested again and barely held," he said.
 "Last Monday," he continued, "the low in the cash market was 9214/32 for a yield of 8.18 percent. Given the current conditions, the long bond is likely to open even lower, setting a new low in the cash market for this current cycle in the bear market. We're looking for the yield on the long bond to move to 8.25 percent in the New York cash market some time next week."
 In the municipal and corporate bond markets, there was virtually no trading because of the holiday, dealers said. Although the cash market was unchanged, futures in municipal bonds were down substantially. The December municipal contract was down nearly a point, and investors focused on next week's slate of new issues, mindful that the Fed will be meeting on Tuesday.
 Treasury issues were virtually unchanged in Europe. There was a limited futures session, but the December contract was not trading when European markets were open so there was little incentive overseas to take fresh positions. European markets edged slightly lower in listless trading. Treasuries also saw little activity in Tokyo.
 The bond market now turns its attention to Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making panel of the Federal Reserve. The market consensus is that the Fed will raise short-term interest rates for the sixth time this year after the meeting. Increases of 50 basis points in both the discount rate (the rate the Fed charges member banks) and the Federal funds rate (the rate banks charge each other for loans, usually overnight loans) are expected.
 No economic reports are scheduled for release until Tuesday, when the Fed will also report on industrial output and capacity utilization for October and the Commerce Departmant will report on October retail sales.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Little Changed In Quiet Holiday Trading

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed in quiet trading yesterday as most American banks operated with limited foreign exchange staff because of the Veterans Day holiday.
 The dollar was unchanged at 97.73 yen in New York trading; it edged up to 1.5305 German marks, from 1.5285 marks on Thursday. 
 Traders are waiting to see if the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates after its policy-making committee meets on Tuesday. The Fed is expected to raise short-term interest rates by 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, to keep inflation in check. But some traders say it will take a larger increase in rates to keep the dollar from weakening again.
 "Fifty basis points won't be enough to support the dollar, because that's so widely expected," said David Solin, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, a New York consulting firm.
 Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments like bonds, and fears that inflation will accelerate have weighed down the bond market and the value of the dollar this year. Many traders say the dollar is unlikely to strengthen until the United States bond market stages a significant recovery. And that is unlikely to happen until the Fed convinces the bond market that it is doing enough to quell inflationary pressures.
 "The Fed has to say it's achieving a tight monetary policy rather than aiming for a neutral one," said Marc Chandler, director of research at Ezra Zask Associates, a Norfolk, Conn., hedge fund with $160 million under management.
 Mr. Chandler, however, thinks the dollar's descent may be over. "The bulk of bad news has been discounted for the dollar," he said.
 The dollar has fallen about 13 percent against the yen and the mark so far this year.
 In other currency trading yesterday, the Swedish krona rose against the mark and the dollar ahead of a referendum on whether Sweden should join the European Union. A "yes" vote would help the krona by forcing Sweden to cut deficit spending to meet union economic requirements. Opinion polls show almost an even division between voters who favor joining the European Union and those who are opposed.
 In New York, the Swedish krona was last quoted at 7.2437 kronor to the dollar, stronger than 7.2589 kronor on Thursday.
 The British pound slipped to $1.5960, from $1.6000 on Thursday. The dollar was little changed against the Swiss franc, at 1.2830 francs, down from 1.2831 francs on Thursday.

HEADLINE: The Outlook For Tax Cuts, G.O.P. Style

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
The Republican action plan, known as the Contract With America, calls for tax relief for millions.
 Although it might be tempting to disregard the proposal as just another Washington wish list, the contract is far more substantive than campaign rhetoric. In fact, it is 41 pages of black-and-white details. 
 And for individuals to ignore the contract's financial elements would almost certainly be a mistake, investment professionals said after digesting this week's election results.
 "I think we're going to see action -- and soon," said Stephen Corrick, a tax partner at Arthur Andersen & Company. "We've already sent out some alerts to clients."
 This is what some of the proposals would do:
 * Cut the capital gains tax in half.
 * Phase out the 1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits.
 * Give a tax credit to married couples who pay more than they would by filing as two singles.
 * Create a new type of individual retirement account.
 * Give families earning up to $200,000 a $500 tax credit for each child under 18.
 * Allow small businesses to deduct the first $25,000 of annual investment.
 "I think the odds are very high that the Congress will deliver" with some significant changes, said Fred T. Goldberg Jr., a former Treasury official and a former Commissioner of Internal Revenue in the Bush Administration. He declared a lower capital gains tax so compelling for politicians as to be a near-certainty. Only strenuous opposition by George J. Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, halted such a measure during the Bush years, and the Maine Democrat is retiring this year.
 Not only is it among the most likely and significant changes, but a capital-gains tax reduction is one of the few proposals that might prompt some immediate changes in financial plans. The proposal, which calls for excluding 50 percent of any capital gains from taxes, would favor middle-income people whose income tax bracket may now be little different from the 28 percent they pay on capital gains.
 The basic strategy for investors is to hold off selling stock or other appreciated assets until 1995, keeping in mind that the tax tail should not wag the investment dog.
 "Movements in the market can overwhelm tax considerations," warned Robert B. Coplan, a tax partner at Ernst & Young.
 Although there is no guarantee that current holdings would qualify for any lower rate on capital gains tax, policy makers are normally sensitive to market reaction, said C. Clinton Stretch of Deloitte & Touche, who is, however, less confident about a capital gains cut than others. "The one thing I know Congress will do is to seek very hard to avoid making people sit on the sidelines" by pegging a tax cut to some future date, Mr. Stretch said.
 The Republicans, euphoric over their impending control of Congress, also propose indexing assets so investors will no longer have to pay taxes on gains that merely reflect inflation. However commendable, the idea would be so difficult to administer that tax specialists give it almost no chance of adoption.
 Most of the rest of the program falls into a gray area. Passage of these elements is plausible, but paying for them would be expensive. In any event, financial planning now is of limited use even if these other elements become law.
 Few people are likely to use the Republican proposals to help them decide, for example, whether to have children or to get married. Still, two high earners who plan to marry will benefit by putting the wedding off until the new year, no matter what. That's because they will avoid the marriage penalty on 1994 income and the penalty could be eliminated in future years.
 There's little chance to plan for a proposed new I.R.A. -- a "back-ended" investment that would provide a tax advantage for withdrawals, not for contributions.
 Repeal of last year's tax increase on Social Security benefits would theoretically encourage retirees to put more emphasis on income than on growth in their investments. But the tax benefit would be so small that it would probably not be worth changing one's behavior, tax specialists said.
 Another proposal would raise the amount people aged 65 to 69 could earn without losing Social Security benefits to $30,000 by the year 2000 from $11,160 now.
 An item that has caught the attention of financial planners is the proposal to increase the tax exemption for estates. Anyone can now leave $600,000, over a lifetime or at death, to heirs free of taxes. There had been speculation in recent years that the limit would be lowered, but the Republicans want to raise the amount to $750,000. Some people who have reached the limit could then resume annual gifts to children.
 A major consideration, of course, is how Congress will pay for any tax breaks given its self-imposed requirement not to worsen the budget deficit. Some specialists are already nervous about a possible threat to the tax-free status of annuities, of the money building up in pension funds or even of I.R.A.'s.
 "It's hard to see how we get a middle-class tax cut that won't affect the middle class" adversely somewhere, said Stuart Kessler, a tax lawyer at Goldstein Golub Kessler & Company in New York. And he cautioned those deferring income this year not to overdo it lest they be caught by the alternative minimum tax.
 "Capital gains will be cut," said Charles D. Youree, a financial consultant to Smith, Barney. "But I don't look for a lot of other things."

HEADLINE: Latin America's Privatization Path

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov. 11

 BODY:
Arching over oceangoing freighters and stretching for 10 miles, the bridge across Rio de Janeiro's bay symbolized Latin America's state-led economic development when it was inaugurated here 20 years ago.
 Early next year, the operation of the deteriorating steel-and-concrete bridge is to pass into private hands, once a construction consortium starts renovating it and collecting tolls under a 20-year concession. 
 As governments across Latin America turn to private-sector concessions to satisfy their people's hunger for infrastructure projects, investment opportunities loom large for companies from the United States. Billions of dollars are starting to flow into projects for telephone service, highways, ports, airports, electricity, water and sanitation systems.
 With the World Bank increasingly restricting long-term, below-market financing to poorer nations in Africa and Asia, some better-off though still developing nations in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America are turning to private business to help build up their facilities and services.
 Latin America has moved furthest along this road, says William G. Reinhardt, who surveys private projects for Public Works Financing, his monthly newsletter in Westfield, N.J.
 "Latin America is trying harder than anywhere else; Latin America is the largest region for successful projects," Mr. Reinhardt said in a telephone interview after touring parts of Mexico's new 3,000-mile network of privately run toll highways.
 Next month, Brazilian authorities will open bids from companies to double the width of the nation's busiest road, a 265-mile highway from Rio de Janeiro to Sao Paulo. In return, the contractors will have the right to levy tolls.
 "With the Rio-Sao Paulo highway, we are talking about a $1 billion investment," said Jack W. Lillywhite, manager of Latin America project development for Bechtel Civil Inc. of San Francisco. He added, "There haven't been too many billion-dollar toll roads around the world."
 In Colombia, the Enron Corporation of Houston is the lead partner in a consortium to build and operate a $200 million gas-fired electric power plant.
 In Chile, where road traffic has quadrupled in 20 years, the Public Works Ministry is seeking bids on a project to convert a 1,000-mile stretch of the Pan American Highway into a four-lane, divided highway, with toll plazas every 100 miles. The concessions would last 15 years.
 Argentina ranks with Mexico as a regional pioneer in highway privatization. Since 1991, the Argentine Government has granted private construction companies 15-year concessions to renovate 6,000 miles of the country's most heavily traveled roads. Spanish and Brazilian construction concerns are widening the access roads to Buenos Aires.
 Privatization "has been a success in spite of initial resistance by the public, who could not understand why they had to pay tolls on existing infrastructure," said H. Jorge Lafage, general manager of Argentina's Chamber of Road Concessions, a private group. After companies repaved highways, added lanes, rebuilt bridges, put up new signs and inaugurated tow-truck service, opinion polls taken at toll booths started to show consumer satisfaction with privately run roads.
 Colombia, which has aggressively pursued improvements, is privatizing its seaports and six busiest airfields. It is negotiating concession contracts with private companies for the construction and operation of $3 billion worth of power plants and $1.5 billion of highways. Some of the Colombian toll roads will be built by Mexican, Brazilian, Spanish and Italian companies.
 Chile's Public Works Minister, Ricardo Lagos, has drawn up a list of 28 toll road and tunnel projects, so that within a decade, truckers could drive in less than three days from factories near the Atlantic coast in Sao Paulo or Buenos Aires to Chile's Pacific ports, distances ranging from 800 to 1,500 air miles.
 United States companies, which have lagged behind, are expected to enter highway projects in Latin America either as minority partners in joint ventures with local construction companies or as technical consultants.
 "The Mexican highway projects have been largely done by Mexican companies, and I would imagine that would be the same in Brazil," said Edwin Berk, senior vice president for Latin America of ICF Kaiser International, the engineering company based in Fairfax, Va. With new privatization projects on the horizon, the company is returning to Brazil after a 10-year absence.
 "What an American company usually brings to a project is either specialized technical expertise or credibility in international financial markets," Mr. Berk said.
 To ease financing, the Inter-American Development Bank decided in April to start lending directly to private companies for Latin American public works and services.
 "Our participation should leverage more private-sector money, particularly long-term financing," Nancy Birdsall, executive vice president of the lending agency, said in a telephone interview from Washington. "Our participation should provide some comfort that governments would honor their promises on prices for energy or tolls for roads."
 In many countries, private companies have been reluctant to operate toll roads or power plants for fear that politicians would yield to public pressure and lower tolls and utility rates below profitable levels.
 "The need for infrastructure is great, but the ability to pay is not," said Mr. Reinhardt, who surveyed 900 private project proposals around the world for a report in his newsletter. "So you have a political disconnect when it comes time for paying."
 Brazilian governments, trying to fight triple-digit inflation for most of the last decade, repeatedly kept electricity, telephone and gasoline prices below profitable levels for private investors.
 "We won't go into countries that have not provided the regulatory framework for profitable operation," said Scott Swensen, senior portfolio manager for the Scudder Latin American Trust for Independent Power. "In Brazil, power rates are so low that doing a power project does not make any sense." The Scudder fund, which started last year, now has a capitalization of $100 million.
 Brazil seems about to allow the largest-scale foreign investment in electricity generation, telephone service and highway construction in Latin America.
 "Brazil needs to restore and expand its transportation, energy and telecommunications infrastructure," Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the President-elect, wrote last month in the newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo. "The entry of private capital is no longer a question of ideological preference. It means the difference between carrying out or not carrying out necessary investments."
 Mr. Cardoso, who is to take office on Jan. 1, has promised a four-year, $100 billion infrastructure program, half of which is to be financed by private money. He hopes that by early next year, Brazil's Congress will approve a concessions bill, which is intended to speed foreign investment in electricity generation and to make the projects profitable for the investors.
 With 16 unfinished hydroelectric projects expected to be privatized next year for roughly $12 billion, four international consortiums have already been formed by potential investors. They include the Chase Manhattan Bank, Southern Electric International, which is based in Atlanta, and Houston Lighting and Power in Texas.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Health Care Plan Out; Health Care Stocks In

BYLINE: By Deborah M. Rankin 

 BODY:
HEALTH care stocks enjoyed an election bounce this week as the Republican victory dashed any hopes of reviving President Clinton's ambitious health care plan.
 But the stocks have been gaining momentum for months. In fact, some of the mutual funds that invest in them are having outstanding years, in large part because of a sparkling third quarter. The leaders, both from Fidelity, are its Medical Delivery fund, up 20.9 percent, and its Health Care fund, up 17.5 percent. 
Charles Magnum, portfolio manager of the Health Care fund, is "cautiously optimistic" about the industry's prospects. "We're probably still in the early- to mid-innings of the game," he said.
 For the year through Nov. 4, the 15 health care funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. gained an average of 3.28 percent, compared with zero gains for the average equity fund. After a dismal first half, the funds broke out in the third quarter, soaring 14.03 percent. Along with the demise of health care overhaul, which was expected to squeeze industry profits, a flurry of mergers bolstered health care stocks.
 "Funds that had a lot of exposure to H.M.O.'s did best," in the latest run-up, said Amy C. Arnott, a Morningstar analyst who follows health care funds. Such funds included Fidelity Select Medical Delivery, Putnam Health Sciences, and Franklin Global Health Care.
 "Laggards this year have been funds that concentrated on biotech stocks," Ms. Arnott said. A striking example is Fidelity Select Biotechnology, down 17.7 percent through Nov. 4. Not only have biotech stocks been hurt by rising interest rates, which makes financing more expensive, but they were tarnished by the recent collapse of David Blech's brokerage firm, which made a market in many of these stocks.
 A consistent performer has been Vanguard Specialized Health Care, the only fund in the category to earn Morningstar's five-star designation -- for top returns with minimal risk.
 "It was basically able to sidestep a lot of problems in the health care area by staying diversified and going for the best values," said Daniel P. Wiener, editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, a Watertown, Mass., newsletter.
 Edward P. Owens, the manager since the fund's inception in 1984, says he holds about 70 stocks, spread among health services companies, medical products, major pharmaceuticals, specialty pharmaceuticals and international companies. Turnover is low and major changes infrequent, Mr. Owens said.
 His three biggest holdings are Zeneca Group, a spinoff of a British drug company, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. "Most sectors of the health care industry look pretty attractive right now," he said, and are selling at multiples below historic norms. H.M.O.'s, he said, are the exception.
 An area he calls ripe for growth is therapeutic treatment of disorders like depression, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. "It's the fastest-growing area in the drug industry," Mr. Owens said. Just as antibiotics were the drugs of the 50's and tranquilizers the drugs of the 60's, "antidepressants will be the drugs of the 90's," he said. The well-known drug Prozac is manufactured by Eli Lilly and Pfizer has a similar drug, Zoloft, "growing just as fast," he said.
 Mr. Magnum of Fidelity Select Health Care is also light on H.M.O.'s. "My focus has primarily been the drug and product side," he said. "There's been a profound change in the way that major drug makers run their companies." He said Bristol Myers-Squibb and American Home Products, two major fund components, "are very, very cheap, and will benefit from cost cutting."
 Invesco Strategic Health Sciences, which is down 2.1 percent for the year through Nov. 4, has been faltering since 1992, when John Kaweske was portfolio manager. Mr. Kaweske left the fund in a flap over unauthorized trades early this year, and his former co-manager, Barry Kurokawa, has made some changes.
 The fund continues to focus on small- and medium-size companies, but is trying to reduce volatility by avoiding big positions in one-product companies. The most striking change has been slashing biotech holdings to 8 percent from 19 percent. "Clearly, our exposure to the biotech sector was much, much too large," Mr. Kurakowa said.
 Investors don't have to own a sector fund to get exposure to health care stocks. Among the diversified funds with large health care positions are Robertson Stephens Emerging Growth (53 percent of its portfolio), Robertson Stephens Value Plus Growth (48 percent) and Smith Barney Shearson Aggressive Growth (36 percent).
 Trying to time the volatile health care sector is notoriously difficult. "A lot of people poured into health care funds in 1991 because of their phenomenal returns," Ms. Arnott of Morningstar said. "They were really shocked at their losses in 1992, and then got out at the bottom."
 Mr. Owens takes the long view. "There is still money to be made," he said, "if you take a 10- or 15-year horizon."

HEADLINE: Shock Treatment for the Budget

 BODY:
Governor-elect George Pataki finds it "shocking" that New York State faces a huge budget gap next year. But people who keep an eye on the state's finances have known for months that the situation was bad and getting worse. The gap will make it that much harder for Mr. Pataki to deliver his promised tax cuts.
According to sources in the Cuomo administration, as well as outside budget-watchers, revenues in the fiscal year beginning next April 1 are likely to fall short of projected spending by about $4 billion. Mr. Pataki must find ways to close that gap before he presents his first budget. Having promised lower taxes, he will presumably try to balance the books with spending cuts and restraints, and by revenue growth from a healthier economy. 
 Gov. Mario Cuomo submitted a balanced budget for the current fiscal year last January, but it projected a $1.4 billion gap for the next fiscal year. The Legislature, driven by thoughts of Election Day, compounded the problem by voting more tax reduction and more spending this year than Mr. Cuomo wanted. As finally adopted, the current budget was still in balance -- at $34 billion -- but the additional spending and tax cuts enlarged next year's prospective gap. Then came big losses on Wall Street, a dip in anticipated tax collections and a slackening in jobs. The result: the projected gap of about $4 billion.
If New York State budgets included a financial plan for future years -- like the planning that the state requires of New York City -- the implications of all those negative developments would have been laid out for everyone to see. The public exposure might even have forced Governor Cuomo and the Legislature to make precautionary adjustments, although election campaigns have a funny way of ignoring budget truths. Neither the incumbents nor the challengers want to deal with the bad news.
Mr. Pataki promised $5.6 billion of tax reduction over the next four years, and has now re-promised it, but he has not detailed what spending reductions would offset the loss of revenue. Obviously, he must crack down hard to balance the budget he inherits, and harder to compensate for any tax reduction he wants in his first year.
Absent systematic accounting by Albany, it is hard to compare the looming $4 billion gap -- bad as it is -- to other years. For too long, the state has budgeted short-term, a year at a time, while failing to establish a long-term balance between the taxes it collects and the money it spends. Faced with this knowledge now, Mr. Pataki could do the state a great service by projecting his budgets well ahead.

To the Editor:
In " 'Bell Curve' Critics Say Early I.Q. Isn't Destiny" (Education page, Nov. 9), you inaccurately attribute the High/Scope Perry preschool study to Edward Gramlich, an economist at the University of Michigan. W. Steven Barnett of Rutgers University conducted the benefit-cost analysis referred to in the article. 
 We directed the preschool study; at our request, Mr. Gramlich wrote a brief commentary on earlier re sults.

HEADLINE: Science Fiction

BYLINE: By Gerald Jonas 

 BODY:
"Nan-" or "nano-": a prefix derived from the Latin word for dwarf. Used by scientists to denote the very, very small, as in "nanosecond," a billionth of a second. Used by science fiction writers in combination with the suffix "-tech" to refer to tiny machines that function on a molecular or even atomic scale.
QUEEN CITY JAZZ (Tor/Tom Doherty, $23.95), by Kathleen Ann Goonan, is a dizzying novel that takes full advantage of the creative potential of nanotech. Imagine a technology capable of transforming matter on the most intimate level, a technology that finds it no more difficult to rewire a human brain from the inside than to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Literally. 
 For Ms. Goonan, the freedom to remake the world in one's own image poses a terrible temptation. She sets her story in the second half of the next century, in a United States -- the state of Ohio, to be exact -- that has been changed almost beyond recognition by the wand of nanotech. Verity, a young girl who does not know her parents, has been raised in the enclave of Shaker Hill by people who have resisted the lure of nanotech, which they refer to as "nanoplague." Driven by violence to the nano transformed city of Cincinnati, Verity, in the course of learning who she is, uncovers the all-too-human tragedy at the heart of what was meant to be the ultimate triumph of human ingenuity.
Perhaps inevitably, Ms. Goonan, a first novelist of enormous talent and energy, overreaches in the same way as the nanotechnologists whose hubris she chronicles. When everything is possible, nothing is more important than selectivity. Like cyberspace, which offers a dangerous freedom to science fiction writers who dive into its boundless universe, nanotech can set the imagination free of all constraints, including those of plausibility and economy. Ms. Goonan's inclination to inflate her already padded narrative with references to every work of literature and music that she admires is counterproductive -- as is her attempt to make more plausible the fall of Cincinnati by attributing it to "an unfortunate and unforeseeable combination of cataclysms."
In the end, what saves her novel from self-destructing through sheer exuberance is the way she grounds her apocalyptic vision in a few short, finely detailed scenes that reveal how personal failings can become writ large in the great events of history.
NAUTILUS (Spectra/Bantam, paper, $5.99) is the fourth book in Vonda N. McIntyre's Starfarers series, which has no rival as science fiction's most leisurely treatment of the dramatic moment known as first contact between humans and aliens.
In a star system far from Earth, a diverse crew of humans has encountered an even more diverse assortment of aliens, whose galaxy-spanning federation of worlds is known simply as Civilization. To gain admission to Civilization, the emissaries from Earth must convince the aliens that human beings have outlived their violent past.
Like its predecessors, "Nautilus" spends as much time tracking the ever-shifting emotional relationships among the crew members as it does describing the nature of the alien worlds and their inhabitants. Even an anatomically frank account of a multisexual menage a quatre comes out sounding a little like futuristic soap opera.
But there is a purpose to Ms. McIntyre's obsessive attention to the minutiae of human and alien psychology and physiology. When one of the characters finally takes action and the others are forced to react, the reader is in full possession of all the facts needed to appreciate what is happening and why. The payoff is a brilliant set piece of colliding cultures that fully justifies the painfully slow buildup.
Paul J. McAuley's RED DUST (Avonova/Morrow, $22) begins with the line: "Mars was dying." To anyone familiar with the modern scientific picture of Mars as a dead planet, a world too small and too distant from the sun to develop life of its own, these are provocative words.
As it turns out, "Red Dust" is set some 600 years in the future, at a time when human efforts to render the surface of the planet habitable -- by introducing genetically engineered varieties of animals and plants, and by modifying the atmosphere -- are faltering. The human inhabitants of Mars are descendants of a mixed bag of settlers from Earth, mostly Asian, with a scorned minority of Europeans and Americans known collectively as Yankees. Most people live in domed communes and cities, but it is possible to survive in the open, like the "cowboys" who tend the free-ranging herds of yaks.
Politically, the Martians are under the thumb of a Chinese elite who control life-extending technology and access to a possibly damaged super computer known as the Emperor. There are rebels in the outback, in the crowded capital of Xin Beijing and in the asteroid belt beyond the orbit of Mars. The rebels have an uncertain ally in "the King of the Cats," an entity who seems to reside on Jupiter and who communicates with the Martians by assuming the persona of Elvis Presley.
Mr. McAuley, it should be apparent, combines a disciplined scientific imagination with a view of history as a kind of evolutionary joke played on the survivors. The story of how the protagonist of "Red Dust," Contract Agronomist Technician Wei Lee, survives assaults on his safety and sanity to become the new Emperor of Mars is not so much a straight-line narrative as a meandering quest for enlightenment, both personal and global. It is a quest well worth sharing.
Maureen F. McHugh's first novel was the justly acclaimed "China Mountain Zhang," which was published in 1992. In that book she created a memorable 22d-century New York City controlled by a resurgent but relatively benign Chinese empire. In her new novel, HALF THE DAY IS NIGHT (Tor/ Tom Doherty, $21.95), Ms. McHugh once again demonstrates her ability to create a persuasive sense of place.
The underwater nation of Caribe is cold and claustrophobic. In hiding themselves away from the sun within domed cities on the ocean floor, the inhabitants appear to have lost all sense of joy. Their pleasures revolve around making money and making revolution; the two sides in what appears to be endless political conflict are presented as equally distasteful. The opiate of the common people is virtual reality: violent war games that fill empty days with a new kind of emptiness.
So oppressive is the chill atmosphere of Caribe that even Ms. McHugh seems to have fallen under its influence. The two main characters, a young woman of Chinese and American parentage named Mayla Ling and a Vietnamese veteran of military operations in Africa named David, are passive to a fault. David, a burnt-out case in the Graham Greene mold, arrives in Caribe to work as Mayla's bodyguard. She is supposed to live up to her grandfather's reputation as a deal-making banker.
Faced with adversity, David decides to flee. Mayla struggles a bit longer before succumbing to the same impulse. Despite Ms. McHugh's consistently fine writing, I found it hard to sustain interest in such a dispirited pair.

THE LAST SHOT
City Streets, Basketball Dreams.
By Darcy Frey.
230 pp. Boston:
A Richard Todd Book/Houghton Mifflin Company. $19.95. 
INNER-CITY poverty entails distressing states of mind as well as material misfortune, the former being firmly secured by a pernicious system of myths. The most disastrous of the myths that confront young African-American men today is the notion that academic achievement and middle-class normalcy are the exclusive province of white folks, and that only swagger and blessed ghetto ignorance are "authentically" black. Add to this the popular racist canard that blacks are "naturally" (read genetically) more suited to athletics than to pursuits of the mind (Eldridge Cleaver called this "the myth of the super-masculine menial"). Stir in the greed of the universities, which share billions of dollars in revenues from college athletics. What you get in the end is mass conversion to, and ruthless promotion of, The Big Lie. To wit: that prowess in basketball magically guarantees a "ticket out of the ghetto," a college degree and perhaps even a career as a professional player. Learn to dribble and shoot, my boy, and the world will beat a path to your door.
That's not how it works. Fewer than 1 percent of the half-million young men who play high school ball will win scholarships. A depressing number of those who do will never graduate. Fewer than one in a hundred of those who play in college will go on to careers in professional basketball. Of this final, golden few, most, through injury, insufficient skill or defects in personality, will last no longer than four years -- has-beens at the age of 26.
Enter here Darcy Frey's "Last Shot: City Streets, Basketball Dreams," a revelatory description of how the basketball myth plays out in the public housing
projects of New York's Coney Island, an isolated and impoverished spit of land at the seaward end of Brooklyn. This book -- compellingly written, with elegance, economy and just the right amount of outrage -- should be read by every parent who has a child involved in school sports, by every college president who pretends not to know what his coaches and recruiters are up to, by every member of Congress who has any interest at all in higher education. "The Last Shot" should be read especially by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and every other top official of New York City, whose corrupt public school athletic system this book lays plainly and painfully bare.
THE myth of deliverance through basketball has always been nonsense. The sport has traditionally involved semiliterate athletes who performed mightily in gyms, failed in classrooms and were discarded when their scholarships ran out. But the competition for these athletes grew heated in the 1980's, after the National Collegiate Athletic Association signed a billion-dollar contract for television rights to college basketball -- and when winning coaches began to earn additional millions for themselves by fronting for the sneaker companies. When Congress and the press put up too much of a stink about poorly educated athletes who never graduated, the N.C.A.A. responded with Proposition 48, raising eligibility standards for those seeking to play big-time college ball in their freshman year. To be eligible for freshman play, an athlete needs a 2.0 average in a high school core curriculum -- and a combined score of at least 700 on the Scholastic Assessment Tests (S.A.T.), about 200 points below the national average for college-bound seniors.
Those who fall short of 700 are grimly referred to as "Prop 48 casualties." Scholarship offers are withdrawn. College coaches look upon these athletes as damaged goods. Illicit characters called street agents broker them to outlaw junior colleges, where they play without even the pretense of being students. The players kick around the outlaw circuit, dropping out of one school and into another, until they end up back at home -- in the case of Coney Island, peddling cold sodas on the scorching summer sidewalks. Proposition 48 came into being in 1986. Since then, Mr. Frey tells us, 91 percent of its casualties have been black.
It is against this backdrop that the journalist Darcy Frey, young, white and curious, arrives at Coney Island's Abraham Lincoln High School to spend eight months with Lincoln's powerhouse basketball team. Lincoln counts among its alumni the novelist Joseph Heller, the playwright Arthur Miller and three Nobel laureates in physics. White flight, budget cuts and a population grown steadily poorer have all done their work. Math and science no longer hold sway here. Lincoln has become a virtual annex of Coney Island's basketball courts.
Coney Island was once the leisure-time Mecca of the white working class, ablaze with the lights of world-famous amusement parks. Today it is home to a 30-square-block area devoted exclusively to high-rise apartment buildings occupied largely by the black poor. Gutted by what was euphemistically called urban renewal, devoid of even the barest social amenities, Coney is hemmed in on three sides by water and on a fourth by the Russian ethnic enclave of Brighton Beach.
Coney Island is in New York, but not of it, a dismal shell of its former self, as distant from the city proper as is the island of Guam. In black Coney Island, as in the Chicago portrayed in the film "Hoop Dreams," basketball is the true and only religion. Deep in the projects, with their ill-kept grounds and urine-soaked hallways, the players have constructed an impeccably maintained basketball court, known as the Garden, a homage to Madison Square Garden in Manhattan, home of the New York Knicks. Mr. Frey writes, "Even the dealers and hoodlums refrain from vandalizing the Garden, because in Coney Island the possibility of transcendence through basketball -- in this case, an athletic scholarship to a four-year Division I college -- is an article of faith." Faith, unfortunately, is impervious to facts. And the facts shout out something to the contrary: Those players and families who worship at Coney Island's Garden have become akin to a cargo cult, praying for blessings -- college scholarships and professional basketball contracts -- that will never come.
A depressing scenario, without question. Yet "The Last Shot" is not, repeat not, just another story of Reporter Goes to Ghetto, Finds No Hope. Mr. Frey shows us levity and light in Coney Island's grimmest corners. His portraits of its young men and boys are warmly, even lovingly written. He cares for them and lets it show. He also reminds us that the basketball players are vulnerable, breakable -- and still children, despite the fact that they appear to us as giants.
AMONG Coney Island's best is Russell Thomas, a studious, hardworking player who studies every night for the S.A.T.'s and carries his vocabulary flash cards everywhere he goes. Despite his estimable powers as a player, Russell has the nervous constitution of an opera singer. When he thinks his scholarship is in jeopardy, he climbs to the top of Coney Island's highest building and threatens to jump. But Russell's poor education undoes him. He never wins the scholarship and is cast off to the junior college circuit.
Russell's teammate Corey Johnson is clearly whip- smart, and he showed as much in junior high school. In high school, though, he has deteriorated into the clown, as if ashamed of the brains he was born with.
The linchpin of Mr. Frey's narrative is Lincoln's tall, muscular center, Tchaka Shipp. In addition to having a body by Michelangelo, Tchaka is the first player in years to meet the college eligibility requirements in his junior year. With Tchaka we take some illuminating trips, among them the jaunt to the annual basketball camp sponsored by Nike, the giant sports- shoe company. Here the players (all of them black) are prodded, poked, weighed and in various ways scrutinized by the coaches (who are nearly all white). The similarity to a cattle auction is clearly apparent.
It is with Tchaka that we see the coaches at their most mendacious, as they romance him and make promises they'll never be able to keep. The reader wants to cheer when Tchaka, having none of it, looks right through them. Tchaka, by the way, is an abbreviation of an African name meaning "the king-child has come home."
THE most startling presence in this book, however, is the freshman Stephon Marbury, already a stellar player at 14. Stephon knows very little, except that he would like to go to Syracuse University "because at Syracuse, you play in front of 32,820 people every home game -- it's crazy-loud in there." How does a 14-year-old boy just out of eighth grade know numbers like that? Stephon is one of an alarming new caste: those for whom the chimerical quest for the Final Four and a pro basketball contract begins in junior high school.
Eighth and ninth graders now shop for high schools based on their knowledge of which ones will pass them along in their grades, give them the most playing time and the best chance to win a title, so that they can be recruited for college. Stephon confides to Mr. Frey that coaches from the Public School Athletic League have been recruiting him since fifth grade. Thus we see that the corruption and emphasis on sports above all else have bled from college down into elementary school. Mr. Frey writes that public school basketball teams are "now riddled with players crisscrossing the city to play on their favorite teams, others whose grades (and second-grade reading levels) should have rendered them ineligible, as well as 19- and 20-year-old kids who shouldn't even be in school."
If there were fewer obstructions, Stephon might be able to read the cautionary tale that is spelled out all around him. His oldest brother, Eric, played at the University of Georgia, failed to graduate and returned to Brooklyn to work on a construction crew. His next two brothers, Donnie and Norman, became Prop 48 casualties, were banished to the junior college circuit and have yet to graduate when Mr. Frey ends the book. The hazards, then, are abundantly clear. But how can Stephon see anything when his own father is trying to broker him to the scouts, and when college coaches aplenty hang all over him -- despite N.C.A.A. regulations to the contrary.
Like millions of others across the country, the Coney Island kids are often fatherless and broke, easy marks for college recruiters like the one from Fordham University who allegedly wrote to a recruit in dollar signs: "See how Fordham can change your life? . . . Health, Happine$$ and Hundred$." It is not the job of the colleges and the sporting goods companies to do what Abraham Lincoln High School is failing to do. But the door out of Coney Island might indeed open a crack if the colleges and Nike paid as much attention to math and science summer camps as they do to profiteering from the basketball myth.
THE cruelest irony of Coney Island's casualties? As Mr. Frey writes: "They stay in school -- though their school hardly keeps its end of the bargain. They say no to drugs -- though it's the only fully employed industry around. . . . But they operate in an environment that forgives none of the inevitable transgressions of adolescence and bestows few second chances.
"Which makes this process of playing for a scholarship not the black version of the American dream, as I had thought eight months earlier, but a cruel parody of it. In the classic parable you begin with nothing and slowly accrue your riches through hard work in a system designed to help those who help themselves. Here, at 17 years of age, you begin with nothing but one narrow, treacherous path and then run a gantlet of obstacles that merely reminds you of how little you have: recruiters pass themselves off as father figures, standardized tests humiliate you and reveal the wretchedness of your education, the promise of lucrative N.B.A. contracts reminds you of what it feels like to have nothing in this world."

California Regulates Those Who Sell Travel

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
IN an effort to protect the California consumer, Gov. Pete Wilson has signed legislation designed to offer a safeguard against potential travel-related scams and bankruptcies. The law, which revises existing legislation, is widely expected to be used as a national model.
Travel scams cost consumers $12 billion a year, according to Federal Government estimates. 
 The revised California Travel Promoter Law, sponsored in the California Assembly by Jackie Speier of San Mateo, will take effect next January for a three-year trial period.
The law includes provisions for a $100 annual registration fee for anyone selling travel services in the state and a $225 one-time fee for California concerns to create a new consumer restitution fund.
The law will also apply to companies based outside California who are selling services in the state and have a business address there.
The fees will be used to create a $1.6 million fund managed by a nonprofit corporation.
In the event of bankruptcy, business failure or fraud, consumers who buy travel services from registered sellers in California will be able to apply to recover the amount they paid, up to a maximum of $15,000 a person.
In the future, travel agencies' advertising or promotional material will be required to print a registration number identifying them as contributors to the fund.
"We were looking for a way to protect the consumer and at the same time do something of benefit to the travel industry," said Patty Campbell, owner of All About Travel in Northridge, Calif., and a director of the California Coalition of Travel Organizations, which actively supported the legislation.
Recent economic hard times in California have also contributed to the risk to consumers who buy travel services there, Ms. Campbell said. "We had four continuous years of economic disaster, which was very hard -- even for established businesses," she said.
The demise in 1989 of Hemphill-Harris Travel in Encino is estimated to have cost California customers a total of $900,000 or more.
"This is a good first step," said Thipphavone Phabmixay Ark, alawyer at the West Coast office of Consumers Union in San Francisco, a consumer protection group. "It is likely to set a precedent for the nation, because travel agents have a huge presence in California."
Although most of the California travel industry supported the law, it is opposed by the Association of Retail Travel Agents, a national organization that supports smaller travel concerns. The association warns that the bill will create a bureaucracy that will be a burden on travel agents and scare off customers.
Because California has a vast economic impact on the rest of the nation, it is likely that the law will serve as a model for other states, according to travel-industry executives and state officials.
Only 10 states -- California, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Illinois, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Virginia and Washington -- impose even minimal legal requirements on the sale of travel.
Rhode Island is alone in requiring someone setting up as a travel agent to take an examination to obtain a state license.
Christopher Ames, a deputy attorney in the consumer law section of the California Justice Department, said he expected many states to adopt the registration provisions of the law, but that most would take a wait-and-see attitude toward the restitution provisions.
Travel fraud is widespread in the state, he said, although individual losses are usually not high. For example, his office is now prosecuting American Travel Incentives, a California company that for several years offered a travel certificate that promised a free trip to Hawaii. After a $19 phone call, consumers found out that they had not received a free trip, but only information on how much a trip would cost, according to Mr. Ames.
The California Travel Promoter Law revises a law, passed in 1971, that requiredthat travel promoters post bonds or maintain trust accounts to protect travelers until money for tickets was passed on to airlines or cruise lines.
But that law was considered vague in defining who was covered. In 1988 the California legislature tried to close the loopholes by passing a new law requiring travel promoters to register with the state attorney general's office, pay a $50 filing fee and disclose their trust or bond accounts.
The law was largely ineffecual, Ms. Campbell said, because the state chose not to enforce it uniformly until it became an issue with state travel agents last year.
Travel industry executives said they expected as many as 8,000 companies doing business in California to register initially. If the fund drops below $1.2 million travel agents can be assessed up to $200 a year to replenish it.

Battered but Unbowed, a Maestro Rebounds

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

 BODY:
HOW QUICKLY HAS Franz Welser-Most, a 34-year-old Austrian with a complicated personal history, risen to the top tier of international maestros?
A scant 10 years ago, he was the principal conductor of the Austrian Youth Orchestra, scarcely known outside his homeland. He has already announced his resignation in 1996 from his first position as music director of a major orchestra, the London Philharmonic. He takes up a similar post next season at the Zurich Opera, having conducted only 12 operas (at prestigious houses, to be sure). Perhaps most remarkable, Mr. Welser-Most, now in demand at leading American orchestras as well as the Berlin Philharmonic, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, the Bavarian Radio Symphony and the Salzburg Festival, has yet to conduct several of the concert staples stockpiled by every budding maestro, like Dvorak's "New World" Symphony. 
 Not that he lacks initiative. He cut his conductorial teeth on blockbusters, leading his young charges in works of Bruckner and Mahler. With professional orchestras, he has championed wayside discoveries of his own, like Franz Schmidt's Fourth Symphony, which he brought to the New York Philharmonic a year ago, and the odd contemporary work. He returns to the Philharmonic on Thursday evening with Arvo Part's Third Symphony and works by Beethoven and Ravel.
As usual on his American visits, Mr. Welser-Most has cut a wide swath, with one-week stints at the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the St. Louis Symphony and the Philadelphia Orchestra. These and other American orchestras seem unable to get enough of him, and it is probably only a matter of time -- not much time, despite his relative inexperience and the cautionary precedent at the London Philharmonic -- before he is offered the music directorship of a major American orchestra. That suits him fine, though not just yet.
"America is my future," Mr. Welser-Most said recently in a V.I.P. lounge at Kennedy International Airport on his way from London to Los Angeles. "I really love coming here and working here. I feel so free, and I enjoy that enormously."
As one exercise of that freedom, he looked forward to Rollerblading in California despite a flare-up of a chronic back problem. His traveling companion, Angelika von Bennigsen, the ex-wife of his former manager and adoptive father, Baron Andreas von Bennigsen, wrapped a scarf around his neck to shield him against the draft.
He spoke with little apparent effort in idiomatic, colorful, British-accented English, replete with umlauts, and his forward, assured manner belied a previous onstage impression of an aw-schucks Woody Harrelson retreating in the face of a clamorous ovation at Avery Fisher Hall.
The St. Louis sojourn must have been especially interesting this time around. Mr. Welser-Most has been widely rumored to be a candidate to succeed Leonard Slatkin as music director of the St. Louis Symphony, which was the first American orchestra to present the young Austrian, in 1989.
"I think it's common knowledge that the orchestra was more than interested in me," Mr. Welser-Most said, treating the issue as dead. "I love St. Louis, and if Zurich hadn't come up, I would have considered it seriously. But for me, personally, opera was more important now."
Just how interested was (is?) the orchestra? Bruce Coppock, the executive director of the St. Louis Symphony, said: "The job hasn't been offered to anybody. It is common knowledge that we have a very special relationship with Franz. He has been here four or five times, and every time has been terrific. We look forward to many happy returns."
For lack of discretion, which is hardly a Welser-Most hallmark, hesitancy may be the better part of valor when it comes to taking on another orchestra soon. His four years with the London Philharmonic have grown nightmarish.
The orchestra has undergone a management transition in recent years, and the London orchestral world has quite simply been in turmoil. Mr. Welser-Most appears to have been something of a pawn at times in the London Philharmonic's successful bids, amid cutthroat competition, to establish a residency in the South Bank Center and to retain financing from the Arts Council of Great Britain. And he has taken a thrashing from the press.
"IT HAS BEEN HELL," HE SAID. "NO other conductor, I think, ever got such a rough ride in London." Although Giuseppe Sinopoli, as music director of the Philharmonia Orchestra (to stick to the present), might debate the latter, the point is well taken.
"London is absolutely a mine field today," said Nicholas Kenyon, whose responsibilities as controller of BBC Radio 3 include oversight of the BBC orchestras. "He was thrown into the middle of all these bloodthirsty Machiavellian politics completely untried and unknown. His difficulties bear no reflection on his artistic credibility."
Few would dispute Mr. Welser-Most's claim that "the basic problem is the system," though others might approach the problem on a different level.
"The system of the self-governing orchestra is in principle maybe a good one, but under these circumstances, it just doesn't work," he explained. "England has been in a heavy recession longer than any other Western country, and the market has really dried out. Especially in bad times, the system needs innovation and new ideas, and people are resistant to that.
"I wanted to give the orchestra more artistic challenges, playing a new piece once in a while, playing sinfonietta-type programs with 40 people involved, playing chamber music, playing an experimental series, all under an umbrella London Philharmonic, organizing and promoting it. And I didn't get anywhere with that. Our people just didn't want to do it. So I said: 'Sorry. You don't have to call me music director if I just conduct some concerts.' "
Hugh Canning, a critic of The Sunday Times of London and one of Mr. Welser-Most's fiercest antagonists, agrees with him about the system, though not in a manner calculated to warm his heart.
"Of course the system is at fault," Mr. Canning said. "He would never have been offered the job if it were not. This is what you get when the funding is totally inadequate, and no major conductor is willing to become a music director in London. Rehearsal conditions are not right. The players are tired. It's compromise all the way."
In fact, Mr. Canning said, all that most London music directors seem to do nowadays is conduct some concerts, and not many of them. "I wonder when London orchestras will come clean and have no music directors at all," he added.
Christopher Lawrence, the manager of the London Philharmonic, rises spiritedly to Mr. Welser-Most's defense. "He came at a difficult time and met tremendous pressures extremely well," Mr. Lawrence said. "The problem is not the self-governing orchestra. It's true that with the shareholders on the premises every day, there is constant scrutiny, and shareholders are innately conservative. But the system of self-government gives a flexibility, resiliency and instinctive commitment that has allowed the orchestras to survive. The fundamental flaw is the structure of the orchestras, which have no permanent financial base. We are always living on the edge."
No wonder Mr. Welser-Most's glasses turn rosy as he contemplates life beyond London. "The Zurich Opera is like Paradise," he said. "The director of that house," he added, with reference to Jurg Keller, "is a maniac, but a wonderful maniac. He's 150 percent committed."
His new base of operations will be closer to his home in Liechtenstein and to land he recently purchased near Salzburg. "I'm still very strongly rooted in Austria," he said. "That's where my heart is."
He was born in Linz, in 1960, the "youngest" of five surviving children, he said instinctively. "Not quite," he corrected. "I've got a twin sister 10 minutes younger."
He also had a sister four years younger, who died in infancy, badly handicapped. In her memory, he has taken up sponsorship of a home for the handicapped in Linz that is saddled not only with financial difficulties but also with an infamous past; during the last two years of the Third Reich, it became an extermination camp for handicapped people from 100 miles around. Even now, Mr. Welser-Most said, with "the mood going more to the right wing," sentiment is widespread in the region that such people do not deserve to live, and he received a death threat last year at the Salzburg Festival because of his advocacy.
He comes by his political and social convictions rightly, since his mother, having studied agriculture and raised the family, sat in the Austrian Parliament. His father was a doctor, and he describes his upbringing as conservative Catholic and not particularly musical.
Like his siblings, he took up an instrument in school: in his case, violin. He was bitten by the conducting bug at 16, when he led the school orchestra, and his future course was sealed by an automobile accident two years later that left him with broken vertebrae and permanently "sleepy" fingers on his left hand.
THE REST IS A VERY brief history that includes positions in Winterthur, Switzerland, and Norrkoping, Sweden, and performances at the Vienna State Opera, the Deutsche Oper in Berlin and Covent Garden. Baron von Bennigsen heard him conduct, took him under his managerial wing and eventually adopted him legally, though his parents were (and are) still alive. The conductor has since parted ways with the baron professionally and personally, though he continues to travel under the name Franz von Bennigsen.
He declines to discuss his relationship with Angelika von Bennigsen. "There has to be some private life," he said, reasonably enough.
Even Mr. Welser-Most's harshest critics concede that he is a gifted musician and that if his performances are uneven, the dispiriting circumstances of recent years may be a factor. Through it all, he has retained great favor with EMI Classics and, according to Mr. Lawrence of the London Philharmonic, with English listeners. "He has an instinctive and wonderful ability to communicate to audiences," Mr. Lawrence added.
St. Louis players report, Mr. Coppock said, that "he puts them in touch with the spirituality of the music."
At his best, as in a superbly supple performance of Brahms's Second Symphony with the London Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall two years ago, Mr. Welser-Most achieves an almost Furtwanglerian flexibility and spontaneity, a sense of creating the music on the spot. Not surprisingly, he prefers the word "re-creation" (though he more often terms it "reproduction") to "interpretation."
"You can't interpret marriage," he said. "You have to live it. And if you just say, 'I loved you yesterday, and that's exactly the way I feel today,' oh, boy! Music is very much connected to life. It has to happen at the moment you do it. If you just try to do it again, it's like warming up food -- although some food actually gets better when you warm it up."
Most music, he did not have to add, does not.

HEADLINE: DESIGN VIEW;
More Than One Way to See Art

BYLINE: By Joseph Giovannini; Joseph Giovannini is a New York architectural designer and critic.

 BODY:
FOR MUCH OF THIS CENTURY, there has been one way of looking at contemporary art, and that is the way the Museum of Modern Art does it -- on right-angled white walls in evenly lighted, shadowless spaces within a highly controlled sequence of rooms. Painters have long supported the neutrality that the Modern represents: in the 1950's a score of prominent artists complained to the Guggenheim Museum that the sloping walls and curved ramps of Frank Lloyd Wright's spinning rotunda would fail to provide "the rectilinear frame of reference necessary for the adequate visual contemplation of works of art." Wright's design, which is indeed inhospitable to some kinds of art but glorious for others, continues to fuel the deep suspicion many artists harbor toward architects.
But a growing number of architects are resisting what they regard as restrictive spaces that limit viewers to a single position in front of an object. One architect weary of what he calls the missionary position is Wolfgang Prix, who has designed -- among many other art projects -- studios for Anselm Kiefer, a painter who climbs ladders, lies prone and stands on his head to "test" his compositions. Two weeks ago, when Queen Beatrix opened the Groninger Museum of Art in Groningen, the Netherlands, Mr. Prix, its designer, led her on catwalks through a turbulent landscape of tilted and angled walls that afford more than one way to see a painting. 
 The stroll with the Queen was a departure for an architect who used to stroll down the streets of his native Vienna in the late 60's inside room-size balloons during urban happenings -- and for one whose work descends from that of Kurt Schwitters and from the insolent gallery installations of Marcel Duchamp.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Prix, a member of the firm Coop Himmelblau, with offices in Los Angeles and Vienna, is an admirer of the Guggenheim -- for its constantly changing vistas and different vantage points, "not only at eye level but from below and above and in between."
"The Modern is an obedient nonstatement," he said, "and the Guggenheim is a disobedient work of art."
The Modern's plain white, evenly illuminated spaces, designed by Philip Goodwin and Edward Durrell Stone in the tradition of the gallery as a white cube, represent a Newtonian universe of objects floating in empty space. Indeed the cool, clean, somewhat clinical galleries are distantly related to laboratories designed for the study of specimens and artifacts. The neutrality is intentional; the art enjoys a detached, antiseptic relationship to the architecture.
If the Modern's design takes the side of the object, the Guggenheim sides with the subjective perception of the viewer. Wright's rotunda, with its hypnotic vortex and curved walls, anticipated Robert Irwin's realization in the 1970's that light and space are media in which even small shifts change the perception of a painting. In the Guggenheim, the universe around a painting is warm, not cold.
Mr. Prix designed the Groninger Museum at the same time that he was working on an installation for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Last winter, in a brilliant match of designer to subject matter, he produced a "dancing landscape" of curved, broken, tilted, floating and shifted columns and planes for the show "Expressionist Utopias."
Works of art hung not on walls but on panels made of steel, ribbed acrylic and concrete board, which leaned against the walls or stood free, creating an agitated Expressionist landscape. Shifting angles of vision caused unexpected juxtapositions. "If the art is good and the architecture is good, it's a most beautiful discussion -- an energy field," said Mr. Prix, "as in the Renaissance when artists and architects worked together without sacrificing their ideas."
Mr. Prix is not alone in deneutralizing museum spaces. At the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, the New York architect James Ingo Freed devised a shadowy, harsh and sometimes confining environment of brick and steel that evokes the banality of Nazi evil and conditions viewers for the exhibits.
To house three 13th-century religious frescoes in Houston, another New York architect, Francois de Menil, designed an entire structure in frosted glass that will be the ghost of the original masonry chapel in Cyprus for which the art was conceived. When lighted, the glass will glow, establishing a context of spirituality conspicuously absent even in museums that display religious art.
Last winter, in the classicized galleries of the Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal, the New York architect Peter Eisenman designed an installation for an exhibition of his own work, with a wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling landscape of heaving and subsiding walls. The installation surrounded viewers, forming an active rather than a passive space. Architectural ideas were presented in drawings and models shown in pockets and shelves of the dislocated walls. By embodying the ideas in the models, the installation reversed the usual relationship of the container and the contained, the viewer and the viewed.
Mr. Eisenman's installation was controversial in Canada, and his design has been even more so at the Wexner Center for the Arts at Ohio State University, his exhibition hall for art of the 21st century. He based his scheme on two conflicting surveyor's grids, creating an unsettling space of crossed floor and ceiling patterns and inclined facades that whisper strange nothings to the inner ear: the design incorporated principles of uncertainty that underlie Mr. Eisenman's philosophy.
Curators who have worked in the space report that conventional paintings do not hang there easily or well. But the center has been especially successful as a petri dish for new art. Its ideas and forms have raised the cultural temperature in Columbus, helping provoke such shows as the current "House Rules" (on view through Dec. 11), about rethinking the suburban house for a multicultural society.
"Once you realize that space is not neutral, it's liberating," said Thomas Krens, director of the Guggenheim. While acknowledging that Wright's rotunda does not suit all art, Mr. Krens has turned its character to advantage by asking artists, including Dan Flavin, Lothar Baumgarten, Mario Merz and Rebecca Horn, to create site-specific works.
When Mr. Krens was director of the museum at Williams College, he was predisposed to the idea of the white box. He was convinced by the architect Charles Moore, however, while working on an extension, that varying the volume and height of space enriched the experience of viewing art. Unpredictable changes from space to space proved more engaging than a chain of white rooms.
MR. KRENS ALSO concluded that the object was not as objective as the white box led the eye and mind to believe. By the time he became director of the Guggenheim, he was an advocate of what he called variable space. "You can have a variety of experience and interpretations with the same object," he said, "because the experience of the architecture is qualitatively different."
In the Guggenheim's ambitious building programs in Austria and Spain, spatial variety has been an underlying principle of designs done by Han Hollein, an Austrian architect, and the American Frank Gehry. The same Kandinsky traveling between Guggenheims, and even within a single Guggenheim, will be experienced in several different environments.
If the Modern's galleries have helped spread the notion of the white cube through the art world, reactions to it have recently rebounded on the Modern. Last spring, its department of architecture and design staged a small show of the work of the New York architect Bernard Tschumi in a remarkably forlorn gallery. Mr. Tschumi, the dean of architecture at Columbia University, designed the installation, suspending several building models on wires in midair at chaotic angles so that their flutter activated the gallery's space, as if it were a medium rather than a vacuum.
In an otherwise darkened area, he purposely illuminated the models and drawings unevenly, to create light, dark and penumbra: the exhibits occupied the space of the viewers, surrounding them in a setting that dissolved the museum's own spaces. The means for transforming and defamiliarizing the gallery were much more economical than Mr. Eisenman's at the Canadian Center for Architecture -- simply a matter of dimmers, spotlights and hardware. But the installation proved an unexpected, even a subversive and subjective, object lesson suggesting other ways to see.

HEADLINE: THE $500 WEEKEND;
At Play in Old Miami Beach

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER; MELINDA HENNEBERGER is a reporter on the metropolitan staff of The New York Times.

 BODY:
(The budgets for the $500 weekends covered accommodations, sightseeing, food and drink, but not the cost of transportation to and from the cities.)
THERE is nothing subtle about the charms of Old Miami Beach, and nothing particularly authentic. Imported palm trees and trucked-in sand line the shore just opposite the blocks and blocks of pastel Art Deco hotels and outdoor cafes that are packed, in the middle of the afternoon, with people drinking liquor and smoking up a storm, listening to piped-in Edith Piaf and Nat (King) Cole. 
 Minutes after our 3 P.M. Friday arrival, my friend Laura and I are being handed menus, at the News Cafe on Ocean Drive in South Beach, with pictures and little bios of film stars from the 30's and 40's. We get Bette Davis and Gloria Swanson. Because of this $500 budget business, which later becomes a nuisance, landing us in a Denny's for the $1.99 Grand Slam breakfast, we order only what we really want: some brie and saga blue, tomatoes and wine ($35.20). There is a sea breeze, and Ella is singing, "Every time we say goodbye." What a sucker I am. This must be heaven.
Just over a decade ago most of this area was run down and ruined, abandoned by the high rollers who hung out here from the 20's until World War II, when South Beach began to fade. Along the boardwalk, farther up the beach, some of the larger hotels, which peaked later, in the 60's, are still unimproved. And their huge empty pools throw the rest of this wonderful, gaudy display into relief, adding a nice note of melancholy.
After lunch, we walk back to our hotel, the Park Central, 640 Ocean Drive, (305) 538-1611, a six-story Art Deco treasure designed by Henry Hohauser in 1937, with porthole windows over the entrance and wide terrazzo floors in the lobby. Our clean, white oceanfront room has high ceilings, the requisite pink and black tile in the bathroom, and funny old photos of girls in modest bathing costumes mugging in front of a sign that outlaws nude swimming. There is fresh fruit on a table by the window, and a room service menu that promises breakfast served until 2:30 P.M. Even if we never actually order at that hour, it's sort of thrilling to know we can.
The accommodations, at $125 a night plus tax, account for more than half of our budget. But numbed by New York rents, I figure this seems about right.
Even though the local people say that fall is in the air, with the temperature dipping into the 80's and palm fronds turning yellow, it's still warm enough for a swim before the light goes, and we head for the ocean across the street at about the same time that the crowd we saw earlier begins to clear.
The wide, white beach is just as Mac, my favorite baby sitter, described it to me 30 years ago. She had a son living here then, and used to tell great stories about this exotic, glamorous place where the flowers were always in bloom and anything could happen. One New Year's Eve, she dressed up in something sparkly -- gold lame, I think -- and brought my brother, sister and me party hats and horns and a carton of Cokes so we wouldn't be sorry we were missing the adult parties. We made a resolution that year to take the bus here together someday and see the Orange Bowl parade.
But the only other time I was here, on assignment, I never saw the ocean, ate in my room and fell asleep watching pay TV, running up charges for multiple viewings of "Dangerous Liaisons." So this is my first real visit. The water is very warm, and we swim back and forth along the coast, watching the cruise ships head out to sea, until the late-day showers begin. By that time it's getting dark, and in this decadent place a nap seems just the thing. Economical, too. When we finally venture out, a lounge singer in the lobby is doing "I'm Beginning to See the Light," acting out the lyrics with goofy hand motions, and we just can't leave. All around the bar there are more pictures of movie stars -- Kate Hepburn in gingham, Burt Reynolds, Elizabeth Taylor in her turban phase, Burt Reynolds.
THE bartender explains that Burt is a part-owner. Or, more precisely, part owner of the bar and restaurant in the lobby. "He's made a lot of bad investments and doesn't really have much money," our barman confides. I don't know how much this guy knows about his boss's bank account, but Laura is moved and orders a budget-busting Tanqueray martini for $7.50, so that poor little Quinton, son of Burt, can go to college. There goes the price of dinner, so we load up on pretzels and feel like Connie Francis and Paula Prentiss ordering tea without the tea bag to stretch their vacation dollars in "Where the Boys Are." We wind up dropping $36.80.
Then we walk up Ocean Drive, where every club seems to offer live music and fusion jazz is fusing with the sound of a samba. The sidewalks are jammed, and surely the world's largest convention of classic convertible owners is cruising past the fountains, backlighted glass brick and neon.
Two blocks over, on Washington Avenue, there are several nightclubs, including the Warsaw, where the sign says, "This is a gay nightclub," and the Glam Slam, No. 1235, (305) 672-2770, a new place owned by the artist formerly known as Prince. Admission is $10 but they let me in for a quick look around. Once Al Capone's nightclub, the building was designed in 1936 and the original chandelier and magnificent sweeping staircase are still in place. Almost as impressive is the bathroom, where a dressing table overflows with makeup, mouthwash, Mylanta, perfume, deodorant and even contact lens solution. When the main floor opens at 12:30 A.M., there is a brief dance show, and real fake fog. Just before leaving, I get a fashion tip from one of the regulars, which perhaps I should pass on. "You need to change your attire," he said. "This is Miami. Get into silk."
Out on the street, several men with pythons wrapped around their necks are making a living charging tourists $5 to be photographed wearing their reptiles, one of which looks like a giant squash. "It can eat a baby," one of the owners says.
A homeless man standing by a pay phone approaches us, not for money, but to ask if we would be so kind as to ask the directory assistance operator for the number of his favorite radio station, and then remember it for him. He's thrilled when we comply, and yells, "I'm on the air, baby!" We spring for a Diet Coke and head back to the hotel, where we find grapes on the nightstand.
I start a mystery by Edna Buchanan, the Pulitzer Prize-winning former Miami Herald police reporter, in which a beautiful, brilliant and blond Cuban reporter named Britt is investigating a murder, lecturing her editor, and carrying on with her source, a hunky cop. Uh-huh. The next thing I know, my roommate, in her early morning Susan Powter mode, is rousing me for a run on the beach. This turns out to be unnecessary, since we spend the rest of the day walking, having economized by forgoing a rental car.
First we join the 90-minute Art Deco District walking tour led by members of the Miami Design Preservation League, which begins every Saturday morning at 10:30 at 1001 Ocean Drive. Our guide, Barry Zaid, tells us how a tiny band of preservationists saved the area from developers, and continues to fight those hoteliers whose buildings are painted in bold shades, like turquoise and tangerine, that would never have been used by the original designers.
"But in Miami Beach, nothing is very pure, none of this is authentic," he says. "So who's to say?"
According to Mr. Zaid, these some 800 Art Deco buildings, with their angular, geometric lines, which went up during the 20's, 30's and 40's, survived chiefly because they were so unfashionable for so long that they weren't worth tearing down.
He does not mention that the preservationists got a lot of help from the 80's TV show "Miami Vice," which brought the beautiful people flocking to an upscale South Beach that had to be rushed into existence.
We begin and end the tour near Gianni Versace's place on Ocean Drive, then stop for lunch at Larios on the Beach, 820 South Ocean Boulevard, (305) 532-9577, which the singer Gloria Estefan owns. I go with black bean soup and plantain chips, and Laura has what she hails as "one subtle tamale" ($32.77).
We spend the rest of the afternoon continuing the walking tour on our own, and then, come evening, head to the Lincoln Road Mall, a pedestrian enclave carved out of mangrove swamps, for one of the periodic Lincoln Road Home Furnishings Walks. All along this surprisingly vibrant walking street, art galleries and stores that specialize in Deco furniture, vintage posters and collectibles have stayed open late, offering coffee, cookies, and in one case, vodka shots, to the artsy, mostly hometown crowd drifting from one store to another. We admire a $4,500 Deco dining table at P.M. Studio (741 Lincoln Road) and a $3,300 upholstered sleigh bed dubbed "The Harlow Bed," at Nu-D-Zine (1006 Lincoln Road).
But before long we are more than ready for the major meal of this excursion. Several people have told us we should not miss Joe's Stone Crab, at 227 Biscayne Street, (305) 673-0365, and we take a cab there. Hang the ($6) price!
Outside the restaurant and all down the block hungry people are waiting. The doorway is blocked, and someone on a loudspeaker is ordering exiting diners to step lively. The parking attendant says the wait is somewhere between two and three hours. We laugh and walk a few blocks to the Century, another Deco hotel by Hohauser, at 140 Ocean Drive, (305) 674-8855, where the lobby is filled with decorative sheet metal furniture by Ron Arad.
In the adjoining garden restaurant, illuminated by candles, there is no wait, and a meal that would have been worth one: corn chowder, warm greens with hazelnuts and goat cheese and two fettucines, along with a bottle of Washington State fume blanc and coffee. Believe-it-or-not total: $60.
Still, we are heading into Sunday with just about $30. Thus the Denny's breakfast and a city bus ride to the waterside development called Bayside. We just can't leave without taking the hokey cruise of "Millionaire's Row" ($10 apiece), and are soon passing properties owned by Ms. Estefan, Julio Iglesias, Vanilla Ice and, of course, Thomas Kramer. Thomas Kramer?
"Ladies, he's single, 33, a billionaire and we have his number!" shouts our captain. Most of the women onboard are middle-aged tourists here with their husbands from the Caribbean or South America, and they are not exactly jumping overboard. We see the house that Madonna looked at before buying elsewhere in Miami, and the building where Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson used to stay.
Then a last, lingering look at the house where "The Specialist" was filmed, and it's time to go. We are $8.41 over budget; I knew we should have skipped Denny's.

HOLLAR'S ETCHINGS
 The first great etchings produced in England were made by a Bohemian from Prague named Wenceslaus Hollar (1607-1677), who had been brought to London by the Earl of Arundel in 1636. A comprehensive exhibition of his work, the first such display in America, opens at the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven on Wednesday, remaining through Jan. 22.
A free symposium is scheduled on Saturday with English and American scholars and experts appearing at the museum, 1080 Chapel Street, from 10:30 to 4:30. 
 Forty watercolors and 219 prints have been assembled from the British Museum and the Yale Center for British Art by Richard Godfrey, an authority on the subject at Sotheby's in London. They include views of Germany, Antwerp and London, and some large watercolors depicting the British colony at Tangier. Also featured are some works by Hollar's contemporaries: Rembrandt and Van Dyck.
Mr. Godfrey will lead off the program on Saturday with a talk on "An Artist in Search of a Market: Hollar's Early Years in England." Christopher White, a professor of art history at Oxford and director of its Ashmolean Museum, will address "The Iconography of the Earl of Arundel" and a talk on "The Culture of the Early Modern Metropolis" will be given by Lawrence Manley, a professor of English at Yale.
Following a lunch break, there will be "Hollar and the English Revolution" by David Underdown, professor of history at Yale; "Hollar's Graphic Art and the Culture of Curiosity" by Celeste Brusati, associate professor of the history of art at the University of Michigan, and "The Antiquarian Endeavor in the 17th Century" by Graham Parry, reader in English at the University of York. 
Visiting hours for the exhibition are Tuesday through Saturday from 10 to 5 and Sunday from noon to 5. Admission is free. The number for more information is 432-2850.
 
ARTISANS IN WESTPORT
 When the first Creative Arts Festival of the Westport Young Women's League was held in 1976, about 65 artisans set up their displays in the junior high school cafeteria and admission was 50 cents.
This year's two-day edition, on Saturday and Sunday from 10 to 5, will feature the work of 145 craftspeople from around the country, be held at Staples High School and cost $6 for adults, $3 for people 65 and older and nothing for children under 12. A breakfast preview on Saturday from 8:30 to 10 A.M. is also available at $12 for adults and $9 for older people.
In recent years the festival has drawn more than 10,000 people annually. Pottery, quilts, jewelry, toys, leather goods, dolls, food, clothing, textiles, furniture and holiday decorations are for sale.
Proceeds are distributed to the more than 50 organizations that the league helps support, in the arts, education, human services, and programs for children and the elderly. To reach the high school take Exit 18 off I-95 or Exit 42 off the Merritt Parkway and follow the signs. For more information, the number is 222-1388.
 
SLAVERY IN GREENWICH
 "Chains Unbound: Slave Emancipations in Greenwich, Conn." is the title of a book to be published early in December by Gateway Press of Baltimore. Its author, Jeffrey B. Mead, will be discussing the work on Monday at 7:30 P.M. in the Greenwich Arts Center, 299 Greenwich Avenue. Mr. Mead is a 12th-generation descendant of one of the founders of the Town of Greenwich. He is a local historian and a member of the Connecticut Society of Genealogists and the New England Historic Genealogic Society.
While slavery was not widespread in what is now Fairfield County, its existence in Greenwich was prevalent enough to arouse Mr. Mead's curiosity. To investigate the period of abolition, from 1776 through 1838, He relied on Town Hall probate records, deeds and texts of the time. Admission to the lecture will be $10, or $8 for students.
 
ON THE MIDDLE EAST
 Each year the Program in Judaic Studies and Middle Eastern Affairs at the University of Connecticut's Stamford branch holds a public conference and this year's program comes at an especially significant point in that region's stormy history.
The conference topic is "The New Middle East: Opportunities and Risks in an Era of Peace," scheduled today from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. on the Scofieldtown Road campus. Admission is $45 and includes lunch.
The first speaker will be Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb, the Egyptian-born director of the Omani Program at American University. She is also an author and television commentator. Her subject is "The Arab World and the Peace Process: Dissent and Support."
Dr. Howard Rosen, a former economist for the Bank of Israel and the United States Department of Labor will talk about "The Economics of Peace: Interaction between the Israeli and Arab Economies;" and Dr. Bernard Reich, professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, will address "Peace from the Israeli Perspective: Benefits and Risks."
The final hour, from 2 to 3 P.M., will be devoted to a discussion among the three speakers, moderated by Dr. Abraham Aschkenasy, a former senior lecturer at Tel-Aviv and Hebrew Universities in Jerusalem. Subjects will include international terrorism, economic reconstruction, Islamic fundamentalism and politics, the status of women and family planning. For more information, the numbers are 322-6336 or 322-3466.

HEADLINE: Q. & A.

 BODY:

Seeking A Solution To the Key
 
Q Years ago, for security reasons, our co-op installed on the front door an expensive lock whose keys supposedly cannot be duplicated without a "key card" that is held by the board president. In an effort to control access to the building, we voted on a policy of one key per adult per unit, and one extra key per unit for emergencies. 
 Recently, one of our tenants wanted four permanent extra keys. When the board refused, he found a locksmith to make the keys illegally. What is our legal recourse in a situation like this? Can we get those keys from this tenant, and is there any way to prevent this from happening again? . . . Lisa Ramaci, Manhattan.
 
A There is no standard provision in the usual co-op documents prohibiting reproduction of keys, said Arthur Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer and vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives. "So unless the policy you adopted was expressed as an amendment to the proprietary lease or the house rules, or was contained in a written agreement that each shareholder signed, there is probably nothing you can do," Mr. Weinstein said.
If however, the policy was properly adopted, "the violation described would be a breach of the proprietary lease, which you can enforce by sending the shareholder a default notice," he said. "Unless he cures the default notice by returning the keys, you may then terminate the proprietary lease. The shareholder's equity in his apartment would be in jeopardy."
If the policy was not properly adopted, Mr. Weinstein said, the co-op board "should consider locking the barn door by amending the house rules to include the key policy, so that if you change keys in the future you will have an enforceable remedy against this abuse."
 
Right to Take In Other Tenants
 
Q In a rent-stabilized apartment, does the tenant have the right to take in other tenants or children, including welfare recipients, without the landlord's approval?
Would this fall in the category of a business being conducted in the apartment without permission? If so, would it be in violation of the lease? . . . M. Napolitano, Brooklyn.
 
A The answer in this specific case is uncertain, because it all depends on the individual lease, said Lou Ganim, a spokesman for the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which oversees rent administration in the city.
"But the bottom line is that the tenant may have the right to take someone into their apartment and even charge them rent," Mr. Ganim said.
"If it's a sublet of the apartment, of course they would have to go to the landlord first," he said. But if the tenant who holds the lease remains in the apartment, the terms of the lease govern the situation. "And subject to any lawful clause in the lease that might exist regarding occupancy or that might limit the right to take in unrelated guests, the tenant may have the right to do so."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Strength Denies Cuomo A Close Finish;
Suburbs Give Pataki Bounce

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
VOTERS in the New York City suburbs played a pivotal role in George E. Pataki's victory last week, sending him to the Executive Mansion with a margin of victory that far exceeded his statewide performance.
Interviews with 379 voters leaving polling places on Long Island and in the seven counties immediately north of New York City indicated that 60 percent voted for Mr. Pataki, compared to 38 percent for Mario M. Cuomo, whose 12 years in Albany came to an abrupt end. 
 Statewide, the race was much closer. With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Pataki, a State Senator from Putnam County, had 48 percent of the vote. Mr. Cuomo, a longtime Queens resident, had 45 percent.
In New York City, exit surveys showed that Mr. Cuomo drew 70 percent of the vote, compared to 28 percent for Mr. Pataki. The suburban survey was part of a larger exit poll of the whole state conducted by the Voter News Service, a consortium of ABC News, CBS News, NBC News and CNN and The Associated Press. In addition to Nassau and Suffolk Counties, it represented voters in Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Orange, Sullivan and Ulster Counties.
Mr. Pataki owed his strong showing in those counties to a confluence of factors, not the least of which is the solid Republican base outside New York City. But some Pataki voters in the suburbs also said they supported his advocacy of tax cuts and the death penalty, felt that the economy was slumping and disapproved of President Clinton's performance.
When asked about the economy, 9 out of 10 of Mr. Pataki's suburban voters described it as not good or poor. One of 4 of Cuomo voters said they thought that the economy was good. Nearly 1 out of 2 Pataki voters said they felt that the family financial situation was in worse shape than it was two years ago.
Asked what form of punishment they favored for people convicted of first-degree murder, 4 out of 5 Pataki voters said they supported the death penalty. Fewer than 2 in 10 said they advocated life in prison without parole. Mr. Cuomo has vetoed every death-penalty bill that the Legislature sent to him, but Mr. Pataki promised in the campaign to sign such a measure.
Asked to identify the one or two issues that mattered most to them, the Cuomo and Pataki voters in the suburbs diverged sharply. More often than not Mr. Pataki's supporters cited the death penalty, government spending and taxes. Mr. Cuomo's backers mentioned his personal qualifications and experience. One out of 5 Pataki voters said it was simply "time for a change."
It was clear that the troubles of Mr. Clinton, who campaigned hard for Mr. Cuomo, loomed large in the minds of suburban voters. Three out of 4 Pataki voters said they disapproved of the way that Mr. Clinton was "handling his job as President."
Fewer than 1 out of 3 Cuomo supporters said they were unhappy with Mr. the President. Three out of 4 Cuomo voters said they voted for Mr. Clinton in 1992, and half the Pataki supporters said they had voted to re-elect President Bush. Nearly 1 out of 5 Pataki voters said they had supported Ross Perot's candidacy.
Each candidate received about half his support in the suburbs from voters whose total family income ranged from $30,000 to $75,000 a year. While Mr. Pataki attracted more voters whose incomes fell below $30,000 a year, Mr. Cuomo attracted more votes among those whose incomes exceeded $100,000.

 BODY:
In "Truly Gross Economic Product" (Method and Madness, Oct. 16), Nicholas Wade did a fine job of using economics to describe the rise in American obesity. How can this trend be limited? In economics, one way to balance an uneven market is through tariffs. Perhaps a "fat tax" on fatty meat and cream would do us good.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Malcolm W. Browne summarized the three books about intelligence he reviewed on Oct. 16 as arguing that "America is rapidly evolving . . . an intellectually deprived population of men and women whose cognitive abilities will never match the future needs of most employers." I propose just the reverse summary: that this population is "being evolved" because the economy no longer needs it and, to continue Mr. Browne's summary, that it will therefore be "permanently doomed . . . to welfare dependency, poverty, crime and lives shorn of any hope of realizing the American dream." To help drive this population farther out of the economy, the 1980's conservatives described it as a morally un deserving underclass that did not desire help, and this decade's conservatives now declare it genetically incapable of benefiting from any help, including education. 
 Ironically enough, the ancestors of the black sectors of this population were denied education in the hope that they would remain too ignorant to revolt against their slave condition. Today's geneticist authors worry that women with low intelligence scores "are reproducing more rapidly than women with high scores" (to quote "The Bell Curve"). The same conclusion was reached by the WASP geneticists of the early 20th century, but they were referring not to blacks but to, among others, the poor Eastern European immigrants whose descendants now often obtain the highest scores on intelligence tests.

HEADLINE: The best, the brightest and 'The Bell Curve.'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
America shows no signs of ignoring "The Bell Curve" and the questions it raises. The most ignoble reason is that its theories confirm what Americans already believe: that African-Americans are less intelligent than Americans of other races. A 1990 study by the National Opinion Research Center found that the majority of whites still believe blacks to be inferior. Among the answers: 53 percent of nonblack respondents said they thought blacks were less intelligent than whites, 51 percent agreed blacks were less patriotic, 62 percent thought blacks were lazier, and 78 percent said that blacks "prefer to live off welfare." To a lesser degree, Hispanic people and Southern whites were pegged with the same stereotypes. 
 The debate intensified by the publication of "The Bell Curve" is about more than intelligence, achievement and race. It's about who and what is American, whom we choose to cherish and whom we discard. The most important campaign issue this season was immigration and how America's changing racial and ethnic composition affects the core values of our country. Proposition 187 in California was designed, among other things, to bar public schools from teaching illegal immigrants and to prevent hospitals from providing them with nonemergency medical care. Many of those who led the charge for Proposition 187 argued that the greatest danger of unchecked immigration is not to the economy, but to American culture itself.
If the 90's have shown us anything, it is that human capital is now more than ever the most important capital that America has. For us simply to shrug our shoulders at a bifurcating society is not enough. We must recognize the trends of division, and have the political and moral courage to chart a new path away from the past.

HEADLINE: The Lost Years of a Nobel Laureate

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
SEVERAL weeks before the 1994 Nobel prize in economics was announced on Oct. 11, two mathematicians -- Harold W. Kuhn and John Forbes Nash Jr. -- visited their old teacher, Albert W. Tucker, now almost 90 and bedridden, at Meadow Lakes, a nursing home near here.
Mr. Nash hadn't spoken with his mentor in several years. Their hour-long conversation, from which Mr. Kuhn excused himself, concerned number theory. When Mr. Nash stepped out of the room, Mr. Kuhn returned to tell Mr. Tucker a stunning secret: Unbeknownst to Mr. Nash, the Royal Swedish Academy intended to grant Mr. Nash a Nobel for work he had done as the old man's student in 1949, work that turned out to have revolutionary implications for economics. 
 The award was a miracle. It wasn't just that Mr. Nash, one of the mathematical geniuses of the postwar era, was finally getting the recognition he deserved. Nor that he was being honored for a slender 27-page Ph.D. thesis written almost half a century ago at the tender age of 21.
The real miracle was that the 66-year-old Mr. Nash -- tall, gray, with sad eyes and the soft, raspy voice of someone who doesn't talk much -- was alive and well enough to receive the prize. For John Nash was stricken with paranoid schizophrenia more than three decades earlier.
Mr. Nash's terrible illness was an open secret among mathematicians and economists. No sooner had Fortune magazine singled him out in July 1958 as America's brilliant young star of the "new mathematics" than the disease had devastated Mr. Nash's personal and professional life. He hadn't published a scientific paper since 1958. He hadn't held an academic post since 1959. Many people had heard, incorrectly, that he had had a lobotomy. Others, mainly those outside Princeton, simply assumed that he was dead.
He didn't die, but his life, once so full of brightness and promise, became hellish. There were repeated commitments to psychiatric hospitals. Failed treatments. Fearful delusions. A period of wandering around Europe. Stretches in Roanoke, Va., where Mr. Nash's mother and sister lived. Finally, a return to Princeton, where he had once been the rising star. There he became the Phantom of Fine Hall, a mute figure who scribbled strange equations on blackboards in the mathematics building and searched anxiously for secret messages in numbers.
Then, roughly 10 years ago, the awful fires that fed the delusions and distorted his thinking began to die down. It happened very gradually. But, by his mid-50's, Mr. Nash began to come out of his isolation. He started to talk to other mathematicians again. He began to work on mathematical problems that made sense. He made friends with several graduate students. He didn't get a job, but he started to learn new things, like using computers for his research.
And here he was at Meadow Lakes. Within a few weeks, Mr. Nash got the early morning telephone call from Stockholm -- 45 minutes late, as it turned out -- telling him that he was being honored along with two other pioneers of game theory, John C. Harsanyi of the University of California at Berkeley and Reinhard Selten of the University of Bonn.
Alicia Nash, with whom Mr. Nash shares a home near Princeton even though the couple were divorced years ago and who was let in on the secret along with Mr. Tucker, breathed a sigh of relief. They called their son, also a mathematician, and Mr. Nash's sister to tell them the great news. Later, there were champagne corks and a news conference, dry Nashian jokes about the prize money not being all that good (his share is about $310,000) and consultations with other Princeton laureates about the proper way to address Sweden's King and Queen when the award is presented Dec. 10. There was even an invitation to visit the White House, on Nov. 28.
On one level, John Nash's story is the tragedy of any person with schizophrenia. Incurable, incapacitating and extremely difficult to treat, schizophrenia plays terrifying tricks on its victims. Many people with the disease can no longer sort and interpret sensations or reason or feel the full range of emotions. Instead, they suffer from delusions and hear voices.
But in Mr. Nash's case, the tragedy has the added dimensions of his early genius -- and of the network of family and friends who valued that genius, wrapping themselves protectively around Mr. Nash and providing him with a safe haven while he was ill. There were the former colleagues who tried to get him work. The sister who made heartbreaking choices about his treatment. The loyal wife who stood by him when she no longer was his wife. The economist who argued to the Nobel committee that mental illness shouldn't be a bar to the prize. Princeton itself.
Together they made sure that Mr. Nash did not wind up, as so many victims of schizophrenia do, a patient in a state hospital, a homeless nomad or a suicide.
Schizophrenia usually strikes people in their teens or early 20's, often without warning, just as they are about to spread their wings. Mr. Nash was struck when he had already begun to soar.
Schizophrenia is often confused with manic depressive illness, the disease that afflicted Vincent Van Gogh, Virginia Woolf and a host of other geniuses. But that illness, primarily a disorder of mood rather than of thinking, typically arrives later in life. Sufferers can often hold high-level jobs and do extremely creative work between bouts. Schizophrenia, on the other hand, is too debilitating to co-exist with great accomplishment. Nijinsky, the Russian dancer, is one of the few known victims of schizophrenia other than Mr. Nash to have made his mark as a genius before the disease struck.
"It is always sad, but particularly when it involves someone as bright as he is," said John C. Moore, a retired mathematician who was close to the Nashes for 30 years. "These would have probably been his most productive years."
Mr. Nash has never talked about his illness publicly except to refer obliquely, at the news conference announcing his Nobel, to the fact that he had made some irrational choices in the past. He declined to be interviewed for this story, saying, "People know what they know."
But many of the people who have been close to him over the years or got to know him in the last few years have been willing, now that he has the extra protection of the mantle of a Nobel prize, to talk about his life and his achievements.
 
Starting Out
The First Signs Of Genius
 John Nash's West Virginia roots are often invoked by people who knew him at Princeton or at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he taught for a while in the 50's, to explain his lack of worldliness. But Bluefield, the town where he grew up, was hardly a backwater. It had the highest per capita income in the state during the 30's and 40's and was home to a handful of millionaires, the Virginia Southern railroad and a four-year Baptist college.
Mr. Nash's mother, Margaret, was a Latin teacher. His father, John Sr., was a gentlemanly electrical engineer. By the time John Jr. and his younger sister were in elementary school, in the middle of the Depression, the Nashes lived in a white frame house, down the street from the country club.
Nothing was more important to the senior Nashes than supervising their children's education, recalls the sister, Martha Nash Legg. John Jr. was a prodigy but not a straight-A student. He read constantly. He played chess. He whistled entire Bach melodies.
"John was always looking for a different way to do things," said Mrs. Legg, a tall, handsome woman who is a potter in Roanoke. In elementary school, one of his teachers told John's mother that her son was having trouble in math. "He could see ways to solve problems that were different from his teacher's," Mrs. Legg said, laughing.
In the fall of 1945, Mr. Nash enrolled at Carnegie-Mellon, then Carnegie Tech, in Pittsburgh. It was there that the label "genius" was first applied to Mr. Nash. His mathematics professor called him "a young Gauss" in class one day, referring to the great German mathematician. Mr. Nash switched from chemistry to math in his freshman year. Two years later he had a B.S. and was studying for an M.S.
His graduate professor, R. J. Duffin, recalls Mr. Nash as a tall, slightly awkward student who came to him one day and described a problem he thought he had solved. Professor Duffin realized with some astonishment that Mr. Nash, without knowing it, had independently proved Brouwer's famed theorem. The professor's letter of recommendation for Mr. Nash had just one line: "This man is a genius."
 
Making Waves
Game Theory And More
 In 1948, the year Mr. Nash entered the doctoral program at Princeton with a fellowship, the town was arguably the center of the mathematical and scientific universe. It not only had the Institute for Advanced Study and Albert Einstein, but also there was John von Neumann, the charismatic mathematician who helped develop the modern computer as well as the mathematical theory behind the H-bomb.
At once eager to prove himself and somewhat gauche, especially compared with older students who had served in the war, Mr. Nash quickly became one of the brilliant young men who performed mental pyrotechnics in the common room of Fine Hall. Soon after he arrived he invented an extremely clever game that was played with markers on hexagonal bathroom tiles. An instant fad in the common room, it was called "Nash" or "John." Parker Brothers brought out a version a few years later called Hex.
Other students found him a loner, odd as well as brilliant. When he wasn't in the common room talking a blue streak, he paced. Around and around he would go, following Fine Hall's quadrangular hallways, occasionally dashing into empty classrooms to scribble, with lightning speed, on blackboards.
"He was always an unusual person," said Jack Milnor, an undergraduate at the time and now a mathematician at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. "He tended to say whatever came into his mind."
Lloyd S. Shapley, then a graduate student and now a mathematician at the University of California at Los Angeles, added, "He was obnoxious. What redeemed him was a keen, beautiful, logical mind."
Mr. Nash's Nobel-winning thesis on game theory was the product of his second year at Princeton. Game theory was the invention of von Neumann and a Princeton economist named Oskar Morgenstern. Their 1944 book, "The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior," was the first attempt to derive logical and mathematical rules about rivalries. The Cold War and the nuclear arms race meant that game theory was an idea whose time had arrived.
Characteristically, Mr. Nash picked a problem for his thesis that had eluded von Neumann. Briefly, von Neumann only had a good theory for pure rivalries in which one side's gain was the other's loss. Mr. Nash focused on rivalries in which mutual gain was also possible. He showed that there were stable solutions -- no player could do better given what the others were doing -- for such rivalries under a wide variety of circumstances. In doing so, he turned game theory, a beguiling idea, into a powerful tool that economists could use to analyze everything from business competition to trade negotiations. "It wasn't until Nash that game theory came alive for economists," said Robert Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics at M.I.T.
Mr. Nash got his doctorate on his 22d birthday, June 13, 1950. After brief interludes as an instructor at Princeton and as a consultant at the Rand Corporation, the Cold War think tank, Mr. Nash moved on to teach at M.I.T. in 1951.
He arrived itching to show that he could solve really big problems. According to one story circulating at the time, Mr. Nash was in the common room knocking, as he often did, other mathematicians' work. An older professor is said to have challenged him to solve one of the field's most notorious problems.
The problem grew out of work done by G. F. B. Riemann, a 19th century mathematician, and was considered virtually insoluble. But Mr. Nash wound up solving it. To do so, he invented a completely new method for approaching the problem that turned out to unlock a difficulty encountered in a far larger class of problems. Mathematicians still describe the solution as "astonishing" and "dazzling."
Most mathematicians consider this and other work Mr. Nash did in pure mathematics to be his greatest achievements, worthy of Nobels if such were given in the mathematical field. Many joke that he got his Nobel for his most trivial work.
Gian-Carlo Rota, a mathematician at M.I.T. who is writing a chapter on Mr. Nash in his autobiography, said that Mr. Nash's results were so novel that they initially struck many people as incredible. "I heard Nash present his results on several occasions," said Professor Rota. "Each time, somebody in the audience would say, 'I simply don't believe a word of it.' "
 
The Disease
'It's All Over For Him'
 By the mid-1950's, Mr. Nash was phenomenally productive. When he got tired of mathematicians, he would wander over to the economics department to talk to Mr. Solow and another Nobel laureate, Paul Samuelson.
And it was during this period that Mr. Nash met his future wife, Alicia Larde, an El Salvadoran physics student at M.I.T. who took advanced calculus from him. Small, graceful, with extraordinary dark eyes, Alicia looked like an Odile in "Swan Lake." "Very, very beautiful," recalls Ziporrah Levinson, the widow of Mr. Nash's mentor at M.I.T., Norman Levinson.
"He was very, very good looking, very intelligent," Mrs. Nash recalls. "It was a little bit of a hero worship thing." They were married in 1957, a year Mr. Nash spent on leave at the Institute for Advanced Study.
By the time the Nashes returned to M.I.T., John Nash had been awarded tenure. Mrs. Nash went back to graduate school and worked part time in the computer center. In the fall of 1958, she became pregnant with their son, John Charles Martin Nash. "It was a very nice time of my life," she recalled.
It is just then, when life seemed so very sweet, that John Nash got sick. Within months, at age 30 in the spring of 1959, Mr. Nash was committed to McLean Hospital, a psychiatric institution in Belmont, Mass., connected with Harvard University.
"Robert Lowell, the manic depressive poet, was also in the hospital," said Isador M. Singer, who shared an office with Mr. Nash at M.I.T., where he is now a professor. "There was Mrs. Nash, sitting there, pregnant as hell. Robert Lowell was sounding forth. And there was Nash, very quiet and almost not moving."
He added, "I've had that picture in my mind for years. I focused mostly on his wife and the coming child. I remember thinking, 'It's all over for him.' "
Psychiatrists who treat victims of schizophrenia ask people who haven't had the disease to imagine how they would feel if unseen voices shouted, if they lost capacity to feel or to think logically. And what if on top of that, asks E. Fuller Torrey, a psychiatrist in Washington and authority on schizophrenia, those closest to them began to avoid or ignore them, to pretend that they didn't notice what they did, to be embarrassed by their behavior? And what if the treatment was ineffectual? That is what happened to Mr. Nash.
In the months leading up to his hospitalization, Mr. Nash became another person. He skipped from subject to subject. Some of his lectures no longer made sense. He fled to Roanoke at one point, abandoning his classes. He wrote strange letters to various public figures.
"It was very sad," said Professor Shapley at U.C.L.A., who ran into Mr. Nash from time to time. "There was no way to talk to him or even follow what he was saying."
The months at McLean did little to arrest the disease. "Schizophrenia is a brain disease," said Dr. Torrey, adding that it is "a real scientific and biological entity as clearly as diabetes, multiple sclerosis and cancer are." But neuroleptics, the drugs that were used to treat some, but far from all, of the symptoms for the next several decades, were just coming on the scene. And psychoanalysis, which has since been discredited as a means of treating schizophrenia, was in vogue. The causes of the disease are still not known.
As absurd as it now seems, Mr. Nash's psychiatrists thought that Mrs. Nash's pregnancy was part of the problem and hoped that he would improve after the baby's birth. "It was the height of the Freudian period -- all these things were explained by fetus envy," said Mrs. Levinson. Martha Legg added, sadly, "In those days, it was all supposed to be the mother's fault."
In any event, Mr. Nash's paranoia intensified and he could no longer work. After resigning his M.I.T. post, he went to Europe, wandering from city to city. He feared he was being spied on and hunted down and he tried to give up his United States citizenship. His wife and colleagues began to receive postcards with odd messages, many concerning numbers. "I rode on bus No. 77 today and it reminded me of you," one read. Eventually, the Nashes separated and he moved to Roanoke to live with his mother.
 
The Abyss
Two Decades Of Darkness
 For most of the next 20 years, Mr. Nash divided his time between hospitals, Roanoke and, increasingly, Princeton.
In 1963, Mrs. Nash divorced him but eventually let him live at her house. Mr. Nash was hospitalized at least three more times. Mrs. Nash, who never remarried, supported her former husband and her son by working as a computer programmer, with some financial help from family, friends and colleagues. "It was a pretty lean life," said Martha Legg.
Mr. Nash became a sad, ghostly presence around Princeton and a mysterious character, the Phantom of Fine Hall, in a novel set in Princeton's mathematics community, "The Mind-Body Problem" by Rebecca Goldstein (Penguin).
"Everyone at Princeton knew him by sight," recalls Daniel R. Feenberg, a Princeton graduate student in the 1970's and now an economist at the National Bureau of Economic Research. "His clothes didn't quite match. He looked vacant. He was mostly silent. He was around a lot in the library reading books or walking between buildings."
Alicia Nash believed very firmly, according to several people close to her, that Mr. Nash should live at home and stay within Princeton's mathematics community even when he was not functioning well. Martha Legg applauds her decision. "Being in Princeton was good for him," said Mrs. Legg. "In a place like Princeton, if you act strange, you're special. In Roanoke, if you act strange, you're just different. They didn't know who he was here."
Roger Lewin, a psychiatrist in Baltimore, agrees. "Some people are so disturbed that there is no way to get in touch with them, but for a significant group, compassion and receptivity of the surrounding community make all the difference."
Some former colleagues at Princeton and M.I.T. tried to help with jobs on research projects, though very often Mr. Nash couldn't accept the help. Professor Shapley at U.C.L.A. succeeded in getting a cash mathematics prize for Mr. Nash in the 70's. There were other forms of kindness, like getting Mr. Nash access to university computers or remembering to invite him to seminars when old friends turned up on campus.
 
Coming Back
Finally, A Remission
 Still, the people who stayed in regular contact with him eventually came to believe that his illness would never end.
Then came what Professor Kuhn calls "a miraculous remission." And as happens, for reasons unknown, in the case of some people with schizophrenia, it was not, according to Mrs. Nash or Mrs. Legg, due to any drug or treatment.
"It's just a question of living a quiet life," said Mrs. Nash.
The most dramatic sign of that remission, perhaps, is that Mr. Nash was able to do mathematics again.
And now Mr. Nash is a Nobel laureate. The story of his prize is itself testament not only to his survival but to the fierce loyalty and admiration he inspired in others. During the 20-plus years of Mr. Nash's illness, game theory flourished and it is hard to find an important article in the field that doesn't refer to his work. But mathematicians and economists who were close to the secret deliberations say that the Nobel was hardly a sure thing.
By mid-1985, the prize committee was evidently actively considering an award for game theory. (The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science is not one of the prizes established in the will of Alfred Nobel, but was created as a memorial to him in 1968.)
Five years later, the committee was making discreet inquiries not just about Mr. Nash's contribution but about his state of mind. There is no formal rule that a recipient must travel to Stockholm to accept the prize in person, give a Nobel lecture there or deliver a few profundities and words of gratitude to the King at the banquet. And there is certainly no rule that the recipient must hold a university post or have maintained an active career beyond the prize-winning contribution.
But no one wins prizes without an active constituency in his field. To most young game theorists who urged that he get a prize, Mr. Nash was a demigod. But Professor Kuhn played a particular role. A noted game theorist himself, he made it clear to the committee that it would be a grave injustice if Mr. Nash's illness cost him the prize.
Early in September, Professor Kuhn got a clear signal that the prize would go to Mr. Nash when he was asked to prepare a curriculum vitae for him and to provide some photographs. At the professor's suggestion, Princeton created the title Visiting Research Collaborator to provide a ready answer for Mr. Nash to the inevitable question of his current affiliation.
The reaction to the announcement was jubilation. "The main message to the world is that the academy says mental illness is just like cancer, nothing special," said Ariel Rubinstein, a game theorist at Tel Aviv University. "It's great."
What will Mr. Nash do now? At 66, he is past the age when most mathematicians do their best work. But the researchers he now talks to say that he is interested in the major unsolved problems and that he has learned to use the computer in ingenious ways.
"The truths Nash discovered were all very surprising," said Simon Kochen, another Princeton mathematician. "Nash is a man who surprises people."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Moderation Plays Well in Johannesburg

BYLINE: By Paul Lewis 

 BODY:
THE clunk of discarded Marxist baggage has been audible all year on the floor of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The market is enjoying the sound of the African National Congress of President Nelson Mandela chucking its more radical economic notions.
The latest example came Oct. 29 when Thabo Mbeki, one of South Africa's two deputy presidents, reversed the A.N.C.'s traditional commitment to state ownership. He revealed that the Government may privatize such state-owned companies as Eskom, which generates half the electricity produced in sub-Saharan Africa, Transnet, a transportation conglomerate that owns South African Airways, and Telkom, the telecommunications company. 
 The Government needs more money to pay for its Reconstruction and Development Program, an ambitious five-year scheme to narrow the yawning gap between black and white living standards. And this year's budget deficit is already 7 percent of South Africa's gross national product.
Like privatization, fiscal rectitude is part of the herculean effort that the Mandela Government is making to retain international confidence in its handling of the economy at a time when about half of the black work force is unemployed and seven million blacks lack proper homes.
So far Mr. Mandela has succeeded better than many observers expected. Pre-election jitters knocked the Johannesburg market's broadest index down to 4,849 in early April. But by April 28, Election Day, it was at 5,250 and on Oct. 7 it peaked at 6,054 before slipping back. It closed Friday at 5,866.
A mixture of domestic and foreign buying has propelled the market, fueled by the lifting of international economic sanctions, relief at the new Government's moderate approach and the belief that the development program will boost the whole economy, particularly the construction sector.
Some analysts now think the Johannesburg market looks expensive. The price of a share of Anglo American Corp., the big gold and mining group that accounts for almost a quarter of the market capitalization, has nearly doubled this year to $60.50.
Adam Horowitz of Rand International Securities, a New York-based division of Noyes Partners Inc., which specializes in South African securities, prefers Eskom bonds, yielding over 17 percent. But he would also buy Anglo American Industrial Corporation, a diversified industrial group, Sappi, a pulp and paper group, and Anglo-Alpha, a cement and quarrying company.
Marianne Hay of Morgan Stanley thinks there are good prospects for the market, especially in the industrial sector. She likes Sasol, which began making oil from coal to beat sanctions and now produces plastics from discarded byproducts. "It feeds straight into the bottom line," she says.
If stability continues, tourism also seems likely to pick up. South Africa, with wildlife on a par with Kenya's, attracted only 650,000 foreign visitors last year compared to Kenya's 4 million. Nico Czypionka of the Standard Bank Group, a South African banking and financial services institution, recommends Southern Sun Hotels as having "good prospects in a tourist upswing."
South African watchers agree that two key unanswered questions are likely to determine prospects for the Johannesburg market in the immediate future.
The first is the health of the 76-year-old Mr. Mandela, who has used his unparalleled prestige among blacks to impose his moderate economic policies. Even rumors of illness make the market quake.
"The first thing American institutions want to know is how much second-tier support Mandela really has." Mr. Horowitz. "It is still a fragile environment."
A second question concerns the future of South Africa's exchange controls. Foreign investors buying and selling in Johannesburg now must use financial rands, which currently trade at a 12 percent discount to the ordinary commercial rand, in which dividends and interest are paid.
The Government plans to abolish the financial rand and relax outward exchange controls so South Africans can invest abroad. But with reserves of only $2 billion, it has hesitated for fear of capital flight.
Mr. Czypionka calls merging the financial rand and the commercial rand "an absolute necessity for attracting foreign investment," and predicts it will happen by next March. Ms. Hay also believes that move will stimulate foreign capital inflows and speed growth.
"Foreigners see the 'finrand' as an excuse for not investing. It's so volatile it is easy to be wrong-footed by its swings," she said, but she predicted that the Government will wait until "confidence is stronger" to merge the two rands.
Letting South Africans invest abroad would make the Johannesburg market more liquid, freeing up local shares for foreigners to buy as South African companies finance their own overseas acquisitions.
"Abolishing the finrand must be followed by capital control relaxation so South Africans sell blue chips to diversify their portfolios," Mr. Czypionka said.

COMPANIES
 
Sears Goes Home (Having Just Sold the Family House)
In the public eye, Sears, Roebuck sells stuff -- tools, lingerie, you name it; it isn't the place to go for financial services. And investors didn't know what to make of it. Invest in the stores, you got Allstate; invest in Allstate, you got washing machines. Last week Sears simplified matters in an instant, splitting off control of Allstate to shareholders -- thus waking from a grand conglomerate dream of the 80's. "Sears is home now," one shareholder said. Well, not exactly. Earlier last week, washing its hands of a mountain of debt, Sears turned over the 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago to a creditors' trust. Also (yes, it was a busy week for Sears), Edward Brennan said he planned to retire as chairman when Allstate's gone, probably by mid-1995. His chosen successor: Arthur Martinez, who in two years did wonders in rescuing Sears stores from terminal stodginess. 

Paying the Bill for Racism
So, what next for Denny's? The restaurant chain has paid mightily for past racism -- refusing to seat blacks, insisting they pay in advance, even locking them out. It has already paid more than $54 million to settle lawsuits by black customers, and committed $1 billion to minority jobs and contracts. And last week it honored another commitment it made to the N.A.A.C.P., agreeing to sell 17 restaurants to a black-owned Atlanta company called NDI. In the deal, NDI may eventually have 47 restaurants in the New York area. Someday blacks might look at a Denny's without seeing red, but for now, add this to racism's ugly realities: It just doesn't pay.
 
Life, Liberty, Blue Jeans
Newt Gingrich probably wouldn't approve. His vision of a middle-of-the-road, one-size-fits-all world, untainted by "counterculture," would surely embrace standard-size blue jeans off the shelf. But now Levi Strauss has started using computers to create custom-made jeans for women: a sales clerk, armed with a personal computer, takes measurements, whisks them electronically to a Tennessee factory, and in a few weeks that Holy Grail, jeans that fit perfectly, is ready. (For about $10 extra, of course.) "This is revolutionary," one analyst said of the system, created by a former I.B.M. software developer. As a Levi's manager put it, "Eventually, this could mean no inventory, no markdowns." Next: politicians, cut to fit.
 
How Sweet It Isn't
Could it be that America's sweet tooth is getting, well, a few cavities? The nation's thirst for sweeter-is-better has turned the soft-drink business into a $48 billion, sugar-coated colossus. And ads for Coke and Pepsi (can they be called "bitter" rivals?) normally try to sweet-talk drinkers over to their brand. But all those iced teas and trendy juices and designer seltzers have been stealing lots of drinkers, so last week Coke, with nearly 20 percent less sugar than its rival, started running ads saying "refreshment goes up" with less sugar. (The ad campaign started on Spanish-language television, but is expected to be broadened soon.) Drinks that are too sweet, said a Coke official toeing this sour new line, are "gooey." Now they realize it.
 
Significant - Material = ?
Once again, the nuances of our noble language enrich our humdrum lives. Last week Salomon Inc. said it might take a charge against earnings because of "unreconciled balances" (read: "It doesn't add up, and we can't figure it out"). How big a charge? The firm said the impact would be "insignificant," while its S.E.C. filing said it "could be material." Let's see: Can a calculator pinpoint that narrow range above "material" but below "significant"? And the culprit in those "unreconciled balances"? It's today's equivalent of the-dog-that-ate-the-math-quiz: the computers done it.
 
Let (Human) Pilots Handle It
After an American Eagle plane crashed in Indiana recently, some people thought they spied a culprit: the French-made plane involved, an ATR-72. The F.A.A. hasn't grounded such planes, the largest prop planes in commercial use, but last week it put them on a shorter leash, barring the use of autopilot in icy conditions -- and telling airlines to try not to use the planes if ice is likely. Federal officials said that if the plane had been under manual control, the pilot might have noticed any ice. It's good to know that sometimes humans are better than machines; too bad no one thought of it earlier.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
187: A Two-Way Proposition
Everything has a price -- well, often many prices, if you must be literal. American business wants badly to forage for profits in Mexico, but then California comes up with Proposition 187, which would cut off most services to illegal aliens. But the big tent may not be big enough for both notions. For even as Californians were voting on Tuesday, protesters trashed a McDonald's in Mexico City, scrawling on the restaurant's windows "Solidarity With the Immigrants!" and "No to 187!" The courts may have the last word, though, because even though the measure, which had Gov. Pete Wilson's support, passed by a strong 3-to-2 margin, a judge immediately barred enforcement for at least a week. There is still, some insist, this little thing called the Constitution.
 
Gas Lines, Russian Style
A big question on the world scene is how long it will take Russia to achieve a capitalist nirvana to match America's. Well, by one measure, it's about 20 years off. In recent weeks, Moscow drivers have learned the joys of a 70's-style gasoline mess, as shortages sent black-market prices up tenfold for those unwilling to sit in mile-long lines to pay the official price. The crisis eased only when Moscow's Mayor raised gas prices -- which had been held at a fantasyland 49 cents a gallon -- by 25 percent. One culprit, it seems, is that demand has soared, with more than a million cars clogging Moscow's unwilling streets. But never underestimate the mysterious workings of the Russian free markets.
 
ECONOMY
 
Prices Rose. So They Fell. Right.
Does anyone understand these statistics? Last week the Labor Department informed us that producer prices fell five-tenths of a percent in October -- a sure sign of low inflation -- saying car prices did the most to pull the index down. Funny thing is, car prices actually rose -- but the statisticians didn't let that get in the way of their arcane calculations. Bond traders may have been confused, too, for rates initially fell on the news, then rose later. More to the point, though, is what Federal Reserve policy makers make of the numbers. They meet on Tuesday, with wide expectation that they'll raise rates.
 
Requiem for the Printed Word
Poor newspapers. They seem to face one indignity after another. First television, with its siren call, lured away droves of readers. Department stores, the ultimate advertisers, started dying or consolidating -- or just skimping. Then computers barged in, spurring cries of "the death of reading." And now O. J.'s judge (O. J. who, you ask? At last, the perfect juror!), acting on the odd notion that anyone can be shielded from news of the case, has ordered that special copies of The Los Angeles Times, purged of Simpson articles, be delivered to the chosen jurors. Sorry shreds of newsprint those remnants will be.
 
Good Morning, Mr. Pataki
On the election front, let's get right to the point: your checkbook. But the crystal ball is a bit smudged. On Wall Street the morning after, stocks soared initially -- a knee-jerk reaction, perhaps, to a Republican massacre -- but fell back when traders apparently decided there was no economic news. In New York, George Pataki, the chosen Governor, gasped when told the state faced a $4 billion budget gap -- but vowed to stick to his pledge to cut income taxes 25 percent. (His calculator was not made public.) There were no national-level Republican gasps, though, in spite of a pledge to cut taxes by $200 billion -- and balance the budget. Which presumably means the Republicans have figured out just how they're going to do it.
 
Popcorn in the Living Room
Are theaters headed for extinction? Many movies already go straight to video, but they've mainly been grade B (or C or D) fare, or knockoffs like "The Return of Jafar." But now comes "Texas": big budget ($12 million) and big name (based on a Michener novel). It didn't even pause on the big screen before heading for the little one -- and by all signs there will be more like it. So if theaters vanish, what will happen to those megaplexes littering suburbia? Well, cells will be in short supply as Republican sheriffs stalk the land, so maybe they can be turned into prisons, with nasty inmates forced to watch "Little Mermaid" over and over. Rehabilitation would follow quickly.

HEADLINE: Ruth and Loyal: A New York Love Story

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
IT is nearly noon, an unseasonably warm Friday, and all down Columbus Avenue people are dawdling in cafes and strolling the street.
But Dr. Ruth Klebaner's and Loyal's strides are brisk, purposeful. Dr. Klebaner has things to do -- checks to deposit, groceries to buy. Loyal, a golden retriever with soft, dark eyes and long, disheveled reddish hair that bounces with each step, is equally focused. Her head is up and her body protectively slanted toward Dr. Klebaner, who firmly grasps the dog's harness. Together, the gait of their six legs is smooth. 
 Two miniature cocker spaniels locked in a car leap and bark hysterically as Loyal walks by. Loyal does not even glance at them; her steadiness makes them seem as frivolous as Zsa Zsa Gabor screaming at a traffic cop.
First Loyal, then Dr. Klebaner, wind around wood crates of kale and carrots and slow and stop at a high curb at 74th Street. Dr. Klebaner listens for the cars on Columbus to speed up, her clue to cross the street. "Forward, Loyal," she says. "C'mon, girl."
The "Don't Walk" signal blinks. Dr. Klebaner has waited too long. Loyal balks. Dr. Klebaner's voice sharpens slightly. "C'mon." Loyal wags her tail and hugs Dr. Klebaner's side. But she does not step forward. She stands, wagging and hugging, until the cars on 74th stop and the "Walk" sign lights up again. Only then does the dog lead the blind woman off the curb and into the street.
This is why anyone who has seen a guide dog work does not wonder if dogs can think. This is what Joshua McMahon, who raised Loyal as a puppy, calls "miraculous." Loyal, handed a serious problem, overruled the command of her owner and solved it herself. This is nothing unusual; the dog does it all the time. This is her work, her routine.
It is also why Ruth Klebaner, who is about 60, day after day lets a 4-year-old golden retriever make such crucial decisions as when to step off a city curb or through a subway door -- and not into the gaping pit of the tracks. Dr. Klebaner, who taught teachers and raised two children, lets Loyal pull her all around the city. When she opens her eyes she sees only darkness, but because she is willing to trust a dog with her life, she has the freedom of the sighted and can walk where she pleases by herself.
Lots of people love dogs. Lots of people melt and coo when they see a hairy, wide-eyed, jumping, wagging, eager specimen. A smaller number collect dogs and books on dogs and write letters to editors complaining that American cities are not Paris and should not bar dogs from restaurants.
But Dr. Klebaner's relationship with Loyal goes beyond that. Dr. Klebaner is married, but Loyal, too, is her life partner. Wherever Dr. Klebaner goes, Loyal leads, never tiring or arguing or making her feel guilty for being such trouble. It not exaggeration to call Dr. Klebaner's feelings for Loyal love, like that for a child, and it is not anthropomorphizing to use the same word to describe Loyal's feelings for Dr. Klebaner.
 
LIFE BEFORE LOYAL
 Ruth Klebaner, in a sturdy plaid wool suit and stout walking shoes, stands alone by the fruits and vegetables at an Upper West Side grocery store. Loyal, looking a little confused, is by her side. "Anybody there?" she says softly, into the air.
No answer. A person here, another there, buzzes by. Dr. Klebaner wants mushrooms. This store, she happens to know, does not like her to run her fingers over fruits and vegetables to determine which is which. She wants to ask a worker to select some mushrooms. But she is being ignored.
"We're on our own, girl," she says steadily.
Later, at home, minus the mushrooms -- for she finally lifted Loyal's harness, mustered her dignity and walked out -- she says: "Standing in space yelling 'Yoo-hoo!' I resent not seeing! I resent it! Merchants that give me a hard time: I tell myself it doesn't matter, but it does."
Ruth Klebaner knows precisely how limiting blindness is and is not. "People say, 'Oh, you can sign a check! How clever!' " she says, her voice scornful.
Her sight, now entirely gone, had diminished gradually for years, decades. She suffered from retinitis pigmentosa, an incurable genetic disease, and inoperable cataracts. Knowing blindness was coming, she did not dither about denying it. She had endured worse.
When she was a toddler during the late 1930's in Koenigsberg, East Prussia (now part of Russia), her Jewish family escaped from the Nazis, fleeing by train and boat to Brazil and then New York. She earned a doctorate from Teachers College of Columbia University and taught education at Brooklyn College for nearly 20 years, becoming a tenured professor. Her husband, Benjamin, taught economics at City College. She took time to raise two sons, now grown up. When she tried to go back full time, the college wouldn't have her because, she says, of office politics. As she would later, she made the best of a bad situation. Her eyesight failing, she volunteered to conduct interviews on "In Touch," a radio program. The show's financing was cut, and she now volunteers as a counselor to professionals working with the handicapped.
When her vision finally darkened, some 10 years ago, Dr. Klebaner pragmatically went about getting a dog guide. She chose the Seeing Eye, the oldest and most formal of the dog-guide schools, with a mammoth endowment, white tablecloths at all meals and a policy of addressing clients as "Mr." or "Ms.'
"Independence is so hard won," she says. "I can't wait for somebody to take me everywhere. It was a strange feeling -- hey, I've got to just sit here! I was stuck until I realized, I can't make it on two legs. I need six. A dog is freedom. A dog is companionship."
Her first dog, whom she met in 1981, was Mackie. He was an exuberant black Labrador. "A ready-for-everything kid," she says. "A very live wire."
Back from a month of learning to walk with Mackie, Dr. Klebaner made a date to meet a friend at the 63d Street Y.M.C.A. No, the friend need not come by for her. "I have a dog!" she announced. "I will meet you!"
For 10 years, Dr. Klebaner met people and went places with Mackie. Then the Labrador slowed, hanging his head, dragging his feet. He was diagnosed with cancer. "I didn't have the heart to say 'Halt,' " she says. "But he never held his head up. He couldn't work, he wanted to end it."
When Mackie died, she felt "a terrible sense of loss," a loss that could only be assuaged by a very different dog, a long-haired female who was sweeter, less raring to go, more delicately hungry for affection. More Loyal.
 
GUIDING THE DOGS
 Joshua McMahon, a 20-year-old with eyes as dark and soft as Loyal's, was a shy, earnest high school student in Bucks County, Pa., a sensitive boy who read a lot. Now, after two years of college, he's dropped out because he can't find a subject that really interests him, and he's too conscientious to waste his time and his and his parents' money.
Looking back, he can think of only one thing in his life that he unquestionably loved, that makes him light up and talk on without reserve. It is something he did from the age of 9 all through high school: raising puppies in the 4-H program. He got the puppies from the Seeing Eye breeders, six altogether, each six or eight weeks old. He kept them until they were 16 months. When he gave one back to the school to be taught to lead a blind person -- which was always wrenching -- he would immediately get another, sometimes on the same day.
He loved it so much that, if he can overcome his shyness, he plans to call Seeing Eye and ask about a job teaching dogs to guide.
Mr. McMahon played with the puppies, housebroke them, taught them "sit" and "down" and to ignore cats and squirrels. He reached down at night to pet them as they lay by his bed and drove around Bucks County with a puppy yapping in the back seat. Evenings, he often stayed in to keep the puppy company.
"It was the most rewarding experience of my life," he says. "All the things I could have been involved with -- none would have made such a difference. Those dogs made a difference. That blind person must love Loyal. I know I did."
Two of the most renowned schools that teach dogs -- German shepherds, Labrador and golden retrievers and the occasional bulldog -- to guide blind people are near New York City. The Seeing Eye is in Morristown, N.J.; Guiding Eyes for the Blind is in Yorktown, in Westchester County. The New Jesey and Westchester schools match about 150 blind people with dogs yearly, teaching the dogs for three months and the people and dogs together for a month before sending the pairs out. The cost of a month at Seeing Eye, including air fare from anywhere in the country, is $150. Guiding Eyes charges nothing, though both schools say the actual cost of raising a puppy and training the guide dog and blind person is about $25,000.
Each school prides itself on its scientific breeding program, complete with computer charts. The cream, the best of the best, are picked to breed. After the new pups are weaned and inoculated, each school sends them to families that volunteer to raise them to adolescence and then give them up. Guiding Eyes enlists families between North Carolina and Maine; the Seeing Eye mainly uses 4-H Club members. The family members praise the puppies for sitting on command and scold them for sneaking food from the table. The dogs learn to go by regular good-dog rules.
Loyal, says Mr. McMahon, "was the easiest one we ever had. The most rewarding. Great with people. Great on a leash. Never snapped. She gave me as much love as I gave her. The whole family loved her. Friends of mine cried when she went away."
Why take the trouble to raise a good dog only to give her away? Especially at the Seeing Eye, which, unlike Guiding Eyes, forbids puppy-raisers from contacting the new owners or even knowing who they are?
"It was tough giving them up," Mr. McMahon says. "The first one was hardest. After that it became bearable. But it's not like the dog died. You'll never see it again, but it's for a good purpose."
Mr. McMahon thrilled with pride when the school invited him to watch, from a distance, a fully trained Loyal lead a trainer.
"It's amazing to see the dog you know doing something so amazing. Raising Loyal was uplifting and rewarding. But giving her up was the best thing I could have done. Knowing what she's doing now makes me happier than she ever could as a pet."
 
CHEMISTRY LESSONS
 Here is Loyal, a Seeing Eye trainer said to Dr. Klebaner one morning four years ago. Go make friends.
A meeting between a dog and a human being -- how nerve-racking can that be? How many fine points of subtlety, judgment, wit, disdain, can be passed back and forth?
Plenty. Dr. Klebaner was both eager and tense, for the encounter, however simple it may look, held for her high drama. This was the dog, as she says, who would daily have her life in her paws. For Loyal, this was the woman who was to become her purpose, her mission, her sole focus, the recipient of all her energy, dedication, love.
At this first meeting, Loyal showed a distinct lack of enthusiasm. Dr. Klebaner was well aware that, though the dogs and people have been chosen after much deliberation, the matches don't always take. Occasionally the chemistry, the vigor, the connection, is missing.
She took the retriever back to her room for three hours. "No eating, no drinking," she says. "You and the dog feel each other out. . . . When I first got Loyal, I thought she was delicious. But she wasn't interested in me. I don't blame her. Suddenly she was attached with a very short chain to a person she'd never smelled or encountered."
During the preceding three months, after leaving Mr. McMahon, Loyal had smelled and encountered plenty that was new. Larisa Scharikin, a Seeing Eye trainer, had had Loyal lead her around progressively more demanding places -- the school grounds, side streets, downtown Morristown. From Ms. Scharikin's tone of voice, Loyal figured out correct and incorrect and got the hang of her new job: Stop at a curb or stairwell. Steer around all obstacles. Jump back if a car nears. Adjust your pace to the trainer's. Lie quietly when the person is seated but leap up if the person makes a move. Doze but stay alert.
Defecate and urinate only on command. Ignore the intriguing pigeons.
If the person says go, forward, hup-up, obey. Unless the person is wrong. If the person insists on stepping into a street busy with traffic or an elevator shaft with no elevator car or into the side of a bus, Loyal must stop her. Loyal was responsible for the person she led.
"You want to put that weight on their shoulders without blowing them away," says Ms. Scharikin.
She would pretend to bump into a tree, a car, and fall down and pretend to be hurt. Thus, Loyal saw the consequences of inattention. Because she is a dog, because of her nature, she adored praise and was hurt if a person she loved was hurt.
For three months, every day, Loyal was put through her paces. Not every dog passes. Dogs who flunk guiding or retire from it become pets. The puppy-raising families get first dibs; others go to families on long waiting lists.
The most even-tempered, energetic dogs go to New York, the shrillest, most alarming city. Those who are chosen go with a trainer and their new owners into the city to practice on the trains and streets.
"In the beginning," says Ms. Scharikin, "Loyal was happy-go-lucky, bouncy, a little bit stubborn. After two months, I was really amazed at how she'd matured. Once she got it she really got it -- her ears up, her tail wagging. She had confidence. Chutzpah. Moxie. 'Hey, I'm coming to that corner, get out of the way!' Loyal had the drive to go around, to push around, to get around. The city! Rah! She'd perk up. She thrived on the city."
With its trains, subways and buses and dense network of sidewalks, the city is, on the one hand, a place where blind people can be unusually mobile. With its speeding vehicles, aggressive drivers, pushy crowds, it can also be a place of fear.
Now, during her weeks at the Seeing Eye, the match held. Dr. Klebaner came to trust Loyal and be willing to follow her, to begin to be familiar with her style and idiosyncracies. Loyal, pulled away from Mr. McMahon and Ms. Scharikin, came to know and become attached to Dr. Klebaner's voice, smell and movements. It was the beginning of a team.
 
TOTAL TRUST
 It's kind of a corny word, bonding. The word implies an abrupt certainty that does not apply to the elusive grays of relationships. Glue dries and bonds object to object. But there is no moment when a person, a child or a dog suddenly, in a measurable way, sticks or bonds to another.
But this much is true: Some weeks after that first long meeting together in her room, Ruth Klebaner and Loyal turned into six legs with the common purpose of getting from place to place fairly quickly and without mishap.
After four years of this, of continual, daily sticking to each other, each now knows the other intimately. Each knows the other's smallest nuance and finds it interesting and important. Dr. Klebaner inhales deeply and Loyal takes notice. She has, over and over, caressed the entire surface of the dog's body.
If one is confused, the other is confused. If one is confident, the other is, too. Quite simply, they need each other to survive. Each looks out for the other.
The dogs, occasionally and dramatically, even save their owners' lives. Richard Conway Casey, a lawyer who is blind, tells of the time he stepped into Second Avenue and a truck came barreling straight for him. Randy, his black Labrador guide dog, turned, leaped onto Mr. Casey's chest and shoved him back onto the sidewalk as passers-by, sure they had witnessed a fatal accident, screamed.
Many blind guide-dog owners can tell such a tale. And nearly all have stories of times they said to go one way and the dog refused or pulled another way. Not only were the dogs right, they did not hold grudges.
In return, the guide-dog owners offer care and praise. When the harness goes on Loyal is serious, focused, dedicated: an ideal worker. When the harness comes off, she abruptly becomes a dog who plays and dozes like any other. Dr. Klebaner delights in Loyal both times.
"It's a bond of love," Ms. Klebaner says. "Her head goes up. She's working. The beautiful thing steps out. You kind of fall in love. You feel gratitude, too.
"Without Loyal, I cannot access. She makes it possible to get up and go anywhere I want to go -- by bus, by subway. She is wonderfully agreeable. I won't know when the street is blocked. We'll be walking someplace weaving in and out. I have no idea what she's doing but I praise her. I know she's responsible for her width and my width. She's entirely in charge and I'm entirely comfortable with that. I know she'll get me from point A to point B. I have total confidence in Loyal."

Atlantic Center Loses Bradlees, Officials Say

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Bradlees, the discount chain store that was meant to be the cornerstone of the 24-acre Atlantic Center development project in Fort Greene, will no longer be involved, said a Brooklyn business association official and others close to the project.
The development, which is scheduled to open late next year next to the Long Island Rail Road terminal at Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues, will provide housing for about 400 families and serve as a major retail center, with 160,000 square feet of store space and a large parking area. 
 Joyce Baumgarten, a spokeswoman for Forest City Ratner Company, the project developer, refused to confirm that Bradlees had bailed out. She said only that "there are leases for 70 percent for the space which will be signed at the end of the year, and the Bradlees space is rented."
Ms. Baumgarten said that other national and local retailers had signed leases, including Pathmark and Old Navy, a unit of the Gap stores.
But Jerome Haggerty, the president of the Atlantic Avenue Local Development Corporation, said it was announced at a meeting on Thursday evening with local business groups that the retailer had indeed chosen Union Square over the project and that another major discount chain would soon be signed in its place.
He said that Forest City Ratner officials had refused to disclose which chain it intended to sign.
The developers said they would announce the names of all lease-holders at another meeting in early January.
A spokesman for Bradlees could not be reached.
The $70 million Atlantic Center is the latest Brooklyn project for Forest City Ratner, which also developed the Metrotech Center and One Pierrepont Plaza.
The development will fill a long-underused 24-acre site in a high-traffic area in the borough. In the 1950's, the site was considered for a new stadium for the Dodgers, but when the team left, nothing the proposed plan's place.
As in almost every other commercially viable spot in Brooklyn, the development of the area has been slowed by local lawsuits over gentrification and the possibility of big business pushing out mom-and-pop stores, and by other, smaller issues.
One such group that worried about the project was Mr. Haggerty's, which serves as an advocate for small local busineeses. "We were concerned at first," Mr. Haggerty said, "but as long as it's not a Home Depot or something like that that would compete with our local businesses here, I think it will be fine. I've been told it's another big discount chain and I have no problem with that."
Housing at the development will be called the Village at Atlantic Center. JENNIFER STEINHAUER

HEADLINE: Vietnam: Behind a Red-Tape Curtain

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam

 BODY:
THE big day had finally arrived. The hotel had set out its finest china and crystal. There were starched linen napkins around a centerpiece of tiny American and Vietnamese flags.
Everything seemed to be ready for the inaugural meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ho Chi Minh City, the city still remembered by most of these American business people and bankers as Saigon. It was to be a day of celebration and optimism last April, just three months after President Clinton lifted a 19-year-old American trade embargo on Vietnam. 
 Then, disaster. Shortly before the meeting was to begin, the American chamber officials got a call from the People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City, telling them to cancel the meeting. "Apparently to have a meeting of more than 10 people, you have to have a license, and we didn't," recalled Rick Mayo-Smith, the chamber's cochairman.
Mr. Mayo-Smith remains optimistic about the long-term outlook for business in Vietnam. But the hotel incident, he said, was a stark reminder that "in this country you have to go strictly by the book, and the book is very thick." And anecdotes like the one about the meeting of the Chamber of Commerce are being heard often these days in Vietnam.
After all the years of waiting to get back into Vietnam, many Americans are finding this a much tougher place to do business than they had ever imagined -- and feared. And their frustration, shared with that of other foreign investors, is threatening to delay Vietnam's economic revival, possibly for years.
There is little doubt in financial circles that Vietnam will someday emerge as an economic powerhouse of Southeast Asia, and this country of 74 million people has made undeniable progress in introducing a free market after decades of economic stagnation. The economy is expected to grow by 9 percent this year.
But while the Vietnamese Government is delighted over their return, many American investors complain that they are being blocked at almost every turn in Vietnam by a layer after layer of bureaucracy, a legal system that barely functions, crumbling infrastructure and outrageous costs for everything from telephone calls to office space.
HANOI, the capital, and Ho Chi Minh City, the financial center, are now among the most expensive cities in Asia to do business, so expensive that some American investors here talk quietly of giving up and going home, or of putting money earmarked for Vietnam into projects in other developing nations in Asia. The costs of opening a business here can easily overwhelm the savings from Vietnam's low-wage work force.
"There was a lot of hype about Vietnam that was built up in the days before the embargo was ended, and people believed there was going to be a rush of Americans," said Antonio M. Cailao, Citibank's representative in Ho Chi Minh City. "Will Vietnam become a economic dragon, a tiger? Absolutely. But it's not going to happen quickly."
He invited a visitor to inspect the panorama out his blue-tinted window in the only modern high-rise building in Ho Chi Minh City. The scene below was of the bustling but dilapidated Saigon port, the river jammed with many more tiny fishing boats and rusting ferries than modern ships. "If you want to be a pioneer, you've got to be prepared to lose a lot of time and money," Mr. Cailao said.
To the disappointment of the Vietnamese, American investments in this country have so far been decidedly modest. The long-predicted American investment boom has not materialized.
AS of September, seven months after the lifting of the embargo, Americans had announced 21 investment projects, worth $187 million, and only a fraction of the money committed to the American projects has actually arrived in the country yet. (By comparison, Americans have invested nearly $500 million in Malaysia this year.)
In an official list that tallies investments in Vietnam by country, the United States ranks only 13th, just beneath the Netherlands, Switzerland and Thailand. Investors from Hong Kong came in first on the list, with 208 projects worth $1.8 billion, followed by Taiwan and South Korea.
Vietnam's senior leaders insist that they are doing what they can to ease the way of foreign investors -- and especially Americans, who are seen as an important buffer to the lopsided economic influence of Vietnam's Asian neighbors.
"This is the greatest concern for the Government right now," Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said in blunt remarks printed in a Government magazine last month. "We must immediately get rid of red tape."
The problem is that Mr. Kiet's message is not moving down through the labyrinthine Vietnamese bureaucracy that is the legacy of decades of rigid Communist rule.
In some cases, an investment project will not go forward until it has the permission not only of the national Government, but of several individual ministries, as well as officials of local governments. The approval process even for the most straightforward investment can take more than two years.
"There are so many fingers in the pie," acknowledged Vu Tien Phuc, a deputy director of the State Committee for Cooperation and Investment. "Every authority would like to have the last say. We have to improve the investment climate."
THE State Committee, which oversees foreign investment, has promised to establish a "one-stop shopping" procedure in which the Government would guarantee investment approval within a short time, through a single office.
Peter N. Sheridan is typical of many of the American businessmen who have come to Vietnam. A 50-year-old veteran of the Vietnam War, he gave up his law practice in Atlanta this year to move here, hoping to begin a new career as a business consultant.
While Mr. Sheridan said that he was impressed with the commitment of the central Government to open the economy and streamline investment, "if you're going to get frustrated dealing with bureaucracy, you'd better not be in Vietnam -- the head of the dragon knows where it's going, but I'm not sure the tail does."
The frustrations of doing business in Vietnam extend even to the giant American companies that symbolize the United States to the world. Coca Cola has been informed by the Government that its request to set up a modern soft-drink factory in Ho Chi Minh City will not be considered for now out of concern over "harmony with the demand of the market."
It is being allowed to go forward with a $20 million bottling plant 750 miles north of here on the outskirts of Hanoi, but that is of little comfort to the company given that most Coke drinkers are in the more prosperous south, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Vietnam's soft-drink sales. Coke's rival, Pepsi, has a joint venture with a Vietnamese company that controls a modern bottling factory in Ho Chi Minh City.
Coke is sold most everywhere in southern Vietnam, but much of it comes packaged in cans imported from Singapore. The result is that a can of Coke can cost more than twice as much as a locally produced bottle of Pepsi, which is why millions of Vietnamese are taking their first swig of Pepsi.
Mark Ohlson, Indochina manager of Coca Cola, uses diplomatic language to mask the soft-drink maker's obvious frustrations in returning to Vietnam, where the word Coke is still synonymous with cola drinks. "There is here a gradualistic approach to development," he sighs.
Vietnam's defenders in the American business community say that the country simply needs time, and that most of the complaining is coming from American investors with little experience in the developing world.
"The rules are not crisply clean yet in Vietnam, and you've got to have staying power," said Buck J. Titsworth, country manager of the Flour Daniel, the giant American engineering and construction company. "Still, I don't think it's any tougher here."
SOME investors say that things are no more difficult in Vietnam today than they were in China in the early 1980's, as Beijing began to open its markets to the world. But with a population a tiny fraction the size of China, Vietnam is a market that is much easier for frustrated foreign investors to bypass than is China.
And China -- and Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and other developing Asian nations that compete with Vietnam for investment -- are much further along than Vietnam in terms of developing infrastructure and a functioning system of laws and regulations.
In Vietnam, only 10 percent of the roads are paved and much of the country is without a reliable source of electricity. The American trade embargo, which for nearly 20 years barred the World Bank and other development lenders from making loans to Vietnam, can partly be blamed for Vietnam's lagging infrastructure.
The United States, however, is not to blame for the fact that Vietnam has no commercial code and that the bankruptcy law has no regulations to support it. Vietnam is trying to bring its legal system up to date, but the result is often chaotic.
"There are laws that come out every week, and you're not sure how they are going to be implemented," said Sesto E. Vecchi, an American lawyer whose firm, Russin & Vecchi, has recently reopened its office in Ho Chi Minh City. "Even when you read the laws, you're not always sure immediately what they mean."
FOR some investors, the most daunting obstacle to doing business in Vietnam is the cost. After the embargo was lifted, land speculators rushed into Vietnam's major cities. A survey by the property firm of Richard Ellis found that a square meter of prime office space in Ho Chi Minh City now rents for as $475, higher than any other capital in Southeast Asia.
Mr. Sheridan, the business consultant, arrived in Ho Chi Minh City in April and quickly set to work finding an office.
He wanted to find a reasonably priced building that could serve as his office and house. Early on, Mr. Sheridan was shown a small house, 900 square feet, far from downtown. The price: $1.5 million. "I just laughed," he recalled.
He eventually found a building in a nondescript neighborhood of Ho Chi Minh City and negotiated the rent down from an opening offer of $8,000 a month to $800. But his new business is still burdened by other high costs. Vietnam's state-controlled telephone system, for example, charges some of the highest rates in Asia, with the result that a fax to the United States can cost $5 a page.
Still, whatever the struggle of doing business in Vietnam, Mr. Sheridan says that he is determined to stay. "These are incredibly hospitable, talented, energetic people, and they deserve our support," he said. "They are asking us to help them enter the 20th century before it comes to an end. I am excited to be part of it."

A Fond Farewell to Big Government

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble 

 BODY:
THE message of the Democratic debacle last week, Washington pundits tell us, is that America dislikes Bill Clinton and hates liberalism and its evil twin, Big Government. This may be so. Certainly, inhabitants of the liberal sanctuaries accustomed to being out of step with the rest of the country are asking themselves how many times in one life they will have to ponder moving to Canada. For now they are just pulling raincoats tight around their "Great Society counter-cultural McGovern-ik" T-shirts and poring over David McCullough's "Truman," looking for nuggets that might help the First Boomer. President Clinton may be no liberal's idea of a liberal, but in the Damien-gone-respectable context of Newt Gingrich, even to the die-hards in Berkeley, Cambridge and New York, he must now look pretty good.
Is it churlish to note that many of the people who say they feel burdened by Big Government are in a position to be so because they, or their parents and grand-parents, were its principal beneficiaries? Collective memory is an Etch-a-Sketch, easily erased. Barely 60 years have passed since the Government's response to the Great Depression reshaped the American social compact, redistributing wealth and creating opportunities for the dispossessed and disenfranchised, or as the phrase of the time put it, "one third of the nation." True, as liberal critics would point out, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal missed a lot of people but it did put the "upward" back in mobility for millions of Americans. It also set a standard for government activism -- particularly in protecting the rights of workers -- that lasted until it ran into a stone wall called Reagan. 
 Return now to those thrilling days of yesteryear and consider the horrors perpetrated over the last six decades by Big Government:
* The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established the minimum wage, the 40-hour work week and overtime pay and restricted the use of child labor.
* The National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which grants the right of employees to form unions and bargain collectively.
* The Social Security Act of 1935, the employment-based savings program intended to cushion the impact of retirement and old age, unemployment and the death of the household wage-earner.
* The Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII of which outlaws discrimination on the basis of gender, race, color, religion or national origin in the workplace.
* The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, governing safety in the workplace.
* The Employment Retirement Security Act of 1974, or Erisa, the devilishly complicated body of law that protects pensions.
Why this didactic stroll through the archives of reform? To suggest that those who take history for granted are doomed to recycle it. The reforms on this list were inspired by the real problems of real people: Workers vulnerable to terrible working conditions and unfair labor practices during the Depression and later, to unsafe conditions or business practices that jeopardized their pensions after a lifetime of service.
HAS the group elevated by Big Government into the middle class only two generations ago already forgotten this? When employee-voters say they want Government off their backs, they mean, mostly, they want to pay less tax and get a lot more stuff for it, especially for the income that vaporizes into the deduction ozone every payday. When employer-voters say they want Government off their backs, on the other hand, they mean they would like to do a Mies van der Rohe on workplace law. Less is more. Even people who would no more talk in terms of "class interest" than be caught dead at a Lypsinka show must occasionally wonder at the incongruity of the vast middle-class, its living standards stagnant, its children's futures increasingly at risk, cast in the role of electoral vanguard for business.
The current mood has created convergences within convergences: Of ordinary Americans and business elites and of a Republican-dominated Congress and corporations that say a new understanding between employees and employers is needed if they are to remain competitive. Of the list of reforms noted above, only Erisa, which many employment lawyers believe has developed into a body of law favoring companies rather than pensioners, and Social Security, which is guarded by fierce cadres of letter-writing, high-turnout elderly, are not in the immediate sights of business lobbying groups. It is entirely possible that a formerly arcane agenda of business-oriented labor reform -- particularly of wage and hour law in sections of the Labor Relations Act -- may now spring full-blown into law from the indices of think tank monographs.
That may be a good thing. It may create opportunity for employees who can take advantage of what most people who write about the future of work say is going to be a more entrepreneurial environment, in which workers will have to be self-reliant. But it is a measure of the success of current law, with all its bureaucratic absurdities, that so few people have had to avail themselves of it and thus have no personal cause to know why it is important.
Any voter who thinks Big Government is a bunch of white liberals plotting new welfare schemes over $2.50 cups of latte at Starbuck's might want to graze mentally through the recent past. Big may be a terrible form of government, but most of the others are so much worse.

Job Goes Unfilled And Youths Suffer

BYLINE: By JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM 

 BODY:
At first, after Kelly Vilar quit her job as Community Board 11's youth coordinator, the spot went unfilled because of a Dinkins administration mandate that laid-off city workers be given hiring preference. Of the more than 100 people interviewed -- former sanitation workers, former Health Department workers, and former child welfare caseworkers -- none passed muster.
But then, last year, the Department of Youth Services cut financing for the job. In Catch-22 fashion, the department said, the money was revoked because the position had not been filled. 
So local youth officials, who have refused to give up the fight to reinstate the money, were heartened by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's announcement on Friday that he was ordering an investigation into the agency's policies.
"The East Harlem community as a whole has really suffered from the department's cuts and the lack of a youth coordinator," said Renee Avery, president of the East Harlem Neighborhood Based Alliance Corporation.
The Mayor said the review would focus on how the department uses its $66 million budget and why it stopped financing older and well-established social-service organizations and awarded contracts instead to newer groups with no track record.
Eddie Baca, Chairman of Community Board 11, said he had noticed this phenomenon in East Harlem, where such longstanding programs as the Beacon Community Center, the largest afterschool program in the neighborhood and El Barrio Martial Arts, a decade-old program, have just been cut by the department.
But for East Harlem, Mr. Baca said, the more pressing problem is the lack of a youth coordinator.
These coordinators serve as advocates and run interference between youths and government and social-service agencies. Without one, Mr. Baca said, the area has experienced worsening problems with high school dropouts, teen-age pregnancy and unemployment.
Department of Youth Services officials are now planning a system in which neighborhoods share youth coordinators. Marty Algaze, Manhattan director of the Mayor's community assistance unit, said that final budget determinations will dictate how many coordinators the city can afford.
While that policy might save money, community leaders believe it will not solve their problems. "It's absolutely pointless to have somebody part-time," said Mr. Baca. "They might as well just not do it." J.K.B.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Gould's Legacy: Rail Regulation For Another Era

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to battles for corporate control, railroads have provided by far the most colorful contests in American financial history. They include sagas of shareholders suckered by their president, of bribed judges and legislators, and of takeover efforts flustered by the fact that, for every share the raider could buy, the insiders could print another.
By the standards of the last century, the current battle for control of the Santa Fe railroad is tame. But the excesses of that era live on in the reactions to it, which created a byzantine regulatory organization so slow that its lethargy has become a major factor in the current battle. 
 Both the Burlington Northern and the Union Pacific want to buy the Santa Fe. The Union Pacific is evidently willing to pay more, but there is a question whether that would restrain competition too much.
In every other industry, the Government, usually the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission, manages to deal with antitrust issues quickly when a merger is proposed. But at the Interstate Commerce Commission, which governs railroads, decisions can take two years or more.
Santa Fe shareholders will vote this week on the Burlington Northern offer, without knowing what the I.C.C. thinks. The Union Pacific, trying to influence the vote, says it is willing to pay more, and will agree to an arrangement whereby shareholders get paid quickly, but don't get top dollar. Then the railroads will be operated separately, with a promise to sell one if the I.C.C. eventually bars a merger.
As the Santa Fe knows, having spent almost five years in the same kind of relationship with the Southern Pacific before a divorce was forced upon it, that is not a good way to run a railroad.
The I.C.C. was born in an era when the rails dominated the economy and acted with little regard for anything except enriching the people who controlled them. The Union Pacific's government-subsidized construction created one of the greatest scandals in American history. The prolonged wars for control of the Erie Railroad included tales of bribery, with judges and legislators on retainer, and of freshly printed shares issued to keep Cornelius Vanderbilt from gaining control no matter how many shares he bought. Jay Gould once kept control of a railroad, despite opposition from most shareholders, by scheduling an annual meeting without letting his foes know what was happening until it was too late. Battles for railroads produced panics and demands for reform.
In 1885, when the first Dow Jones stock average was begun, it included 12 railroad stocks, and only two others. The rails practically were the American economy.
To say that is no longer the case is to state the obvious. There are now six rail stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500, making up 1.1 percent of the total market value of the index. Some rails are doing very well, having learned to haul truck trailers on long journeys for less than the trucking companies can do it themselves. But they are far from all-powerful and the regulatory climate should reflect that fact.
Judging from their campaigns, the Republicans now taking over Congress have better ideas of how they want to cut taxes than of where to cut spending. They should take a long look at the I.C.C., and ask if this relic of the robber barons is really needed now.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CONEY ISLAND;
Islamic Guard Unit Ousted

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Under pressure from a Brooklyn Assemblyman, state housing officials have decided not to renew a building-security contract held by a unit of the Nation of Islam.
But outraged residents, along with the buildings' management, have vowed to fight the move, saying the company had greatly increased safety in the Coney Island housing project. 
 The contract for the state-regulated project, Ocean Towers, was awarded 18 months ago to X-Men Security after a previous agency was dismissed because some of its guards were involved in drug trade in the project, a spokesman for the management company said.
When an X-Men guard approached Assemblyman Jules Polonetsky, who represents the 46th District, to ask for his help in maintaining the contract, Mr. Polonetsky told him that he not only would not support the group but that he would see to it that it was ousted.
Mr. Polonetsky has maintained that the group's contract violated state equal opportunity laws because he said the guards sought converts to Islam within the buildings, and because he said that the company's parent organization, Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam, "advocates and promotes hatred against whites, Jews, women and others."
He also asserted that the security guards sold newspapers, incense and bean pies in the buildings.
Louis Gannon, a spokesman for the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which approves security contracts awarded by the buildings' management company, said Wednesday that the X-Men's $300,000 contract would not be renewed because the company did not bid low enough and because of activities "that were not part of their security duties," he said.
But many residents say their fears of drug dealers and other criminals had been greatly reduced by the X-Men's presence and were dismayed by the news that their contract had been suspended.
One who was upset was Marietta Hammock, 82, a resident of Ocean Towers for 20 years who said she had witnessed its downward spiral from a community development to a haven for drug dealers. "Before they came, how did we know when it was 2 A.M.?" she said. "When we heard the guns. But lately, those dealers had gradually moved away."
A manager at BSR Management, which runs the buildings, said that since the X-Men moved in, crime had dropped dramatically and that the vacancy rate had dropped from 30 percent to almost 1 percent.
"We are extremely happy with the X-Men," said the manager, who spoke on condition that he not be identified since he is still trying to find a way to have the contract renewed. "That building was going to go down, and it was not bullets and guns that stop the drug dealers, it was the respect they had for the X-Men."
Some of the residents conceded that there may have been some selling of incense and bean pies by the X-Men, but argued that they were confused as to why that should attract the attention of a politician whom they had never seen in their building before, even though they had written to him and called him many times with various complaints about the poor state of the project.
"We found it awfully strange that when we needed help with crimes and drugs and wrote to him, he never acknowledged us," said Sheila Boyd, a resident who organized a small protest outside Mr. Polonetsky's office. "As soon as the X-Men came on, all of a sudden, he came out of the woodwork."
An X-Men spokesman, Anthony Muhammad, said he expected the contract eventually to be renewed.
"The X-Men did do a good job at cleaning up the building," said Mr. Polonetsky, in response to the protest. "But I say, Mussolini made the trains run on time, too. The state cannot be supporting a hate group." JENNIFER STEINHAUER

No Crystal Ball Needed on Crime

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
POLITICAL oratory and people's fears notwithstanding, crime is decreasing across the country. But the drop has less to do with all the get-tough talk than it does with the fact that fewer children were born to American mothers in the 1970's.
Criminologists are sure that in the next decade, crime will rise again to record levels because of the far different demographic trends of the 1980's. And while no one has easy answers, the near-certainty of demography raises disturbing questions, among them: What can be done for today's troubled toddlers to keep them from becoming criminals a decade from now? 
 "I describe it as the boa constrictor phenomenon," said the New York City Police Commissioner, William J. Bratton, noting that the number of Americans under the age of 18, now 60 million, will increase to more than 70 million by the turn of the century. "We can see that bulge of youth population coming."
A survey by the New York City Police Department of 20 of 22 big cities showed declines in serious crimes reported to the police the first six months of this year compared to the same period in 1993. In New York City, homicides were down 15 percent the first nine months of the year, while robbery and auto theft were down 13 percent compared to 1993.
Criminal justice experts say the reasons for the drop in crime are many. Cocaine use has diminished in recent years. Local governments have imprisoned more criminals, and with longer sentences. More police officers have been put on street beats. Finally, and perhaps most important, the aging of the 76-million-strong post-World War II baby boom generation has made the population grayer.
 
Lookingn Ahead, Glumly
 But, as Alfred Blumstein, a Carnegie Mellon University professor and former president of the American Society of Criminology, warned, "Starting in the next year or beyond, demographics will start to work against us as the number in the high-crime age group increases." Putting it more ominously, James Alan Fox, dean of the College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University, said: "To prevent a blood bath in the year 2005, when we will have a flood of 15-year-olds, we have to do something today with the 5-year-olds. But when push comes to shove, prevention programs often fall by the wayside in favor of increased incarceration."
Nevertheless, politicians and police chiefs are already taking credit for the recent improvement in crime statistics, even though the reasons for the safer streets have little to do with the seductively simple solutions they have promoted in the past year. The drop in crime came before the $30-billion Federal anti-crime bill, with its expansion of the death penalty and mandatory life imprisonment for people convicted of three serious crimes.
Had such punitive measures been in effect, say, two years ago, they would have had only a limited impact on current crime statistics anyway, since the courts customarily only sentence repeat offenders over the age of 25 to death or to life in prison.
From 1985 to 1992, while the homicide arrest rate of adults older than 25 remained constant, the homicide arrest rates for males 16 to 20 more than doubled. And while 52 of every 100,000 17-year-olds were arrested on homicide charges in 1992, only 10 of every 100,000 33-year-olds were arrested for homicide. Because youth violence is more random -- teen-agers kill strangers more frequently than do adult criminals -- the rise in teen-age crime is at the core of the rising fear of recent years.
Crime always goes up and down, usually in five- to 10-year cycles. The national homicide rate soared from 4.8 to 9.8 per 100,000 in the 1960's and has hovered between 8 and 10.2 murders per 100,000 people since 1970. (In New York City, there were 1,645 homicides in 1975, 1,821 in 1980, 1,392 in 1985, and 1,951 in 1993.)
 
Try Demographics
 Crime waves are fueled by drugs, guns, unemployment and breakdowns in family life. Criminologists attribute a dip in homicides from 1980 to 1985 to the fact that the number of baby boom youths between 17 and 24 peaked in 1980. Criminologists further predicted more than a decade-long decline in violent crime as the population aged; they just didn't count on the arrival of crack cocaine around 1985.
All things being equal, said Richard H. Girgenti, the New York State Director of Criminal Justice, "Demographics have always been the best predictor of future crime." Noting that the number of males from 15 to 19 will grow in the state from 570,000 today to 670,000 in 2007, he said: "I don't need a crystal ball."

HEADLINE: THE NATION: Right Stuff;
G.O.P. Unleashes Its New Weapon: Winning Candidates

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Republican romp in Tuesday's election was a repudiation of President Clinton. It represented disgust with big government and the way Congress has been operating. It indicated a shift toward conservatism. It reflected the anxiety of many voters about their future and that of their children in a rapidly changing economy. Or so the pundits say.
These may in fact be trends, or they may be fleeting fancies that will evaporate by the next election. But one underpinning of the sweeping Republican victory that may represent a lasting change in American politics has hardly been noticed: Republicans this year fielded more appealing candidates than Democrats for offices from coast to coast, removing an edge Democrats have banked on for years. 
 For several decades, smart, ambitious people who wanted to go into politics were more likely to be Democrats. Talented people who thought like Republicans were, as a rule, less interested in government, and more likely to become, say, investment bankers or business executives or doctors.
In his 1991 book, "The United States of Ambition: Politicians, Power and the Pursuit of Office," Alan Ehrenhalt documented how this disparity had enabled Democrats to maintain their grip on Congress, most state legislatures and local governments year after year while voters were comfortably electing Republican Presidents. He quoted a Democratic state senator from Wisconsin as explaining: "The Republicans hate government. Why be here if you hate government? So they let us run it for them."
 
More Experience
 But in 1994, for one of the few times since World War II, said Gary Jacobson, a political science professor at the University of California at San Diego who studies Congressional elections, Republicans produced more experienced challengers than Democrats in terms of having held elected office. In addition, Professor Jacobson said, "Republicans came up with many outstanding candidates who were not career politicians but proved to be very good campaigners."
Take Tennessee, for example. Neither Bill Frist nor Fred Dalton Thompson, who won the state's two Senate seats, had ever held elected office. Other than that, they could hardly be more different from one another on the surface. Dr. Frist is a wealthy heart surgeon, a smooth and handsome Princeton graduate with a photogenic family. Mr. Thompson is a beefy, back-slapping, divorced lawyer, lobbyist and part-time actor who traveled the state in a pickup truck.
Both were marvelous candidates. Willing to work round the clock, Dr. Frist kept his campaign office open 24 hours a day and was able to get his message across with the help of more than $2 million from his personal fortune. Mr. Thompson had the ability to adopt a mien of sophistication in the cities and of a good ol' boy in the country.
 
Defeating the Pros
 Both came from behind to win solid victories over well-known Democratic opponents -- Dr. Frist over Jim Sasser, a three-term Senator, and Mr. Thompson over Jim Cooper, the son of a former Governor and a Congressman for the last 12 years.
A similar situation developed in Georgia, where three new Republican Congressmen were elected, two of them defeating incumbents.
Bob Barr, who ousted Representative Buddy Darden in a district in the northwest part of the state, is a 45-year-old former United States Attorney who had gained name recognition when he ran in the Republican Senate primary two years ago and narrowly lost to Senator Paul D. Coverdell. Mr. Darden began a career in government as a state prosecutor in 1968 and has been in Congress for the last 12 years.
Charlie Norwood, who defeated a freshman Democrat, Don Johnson, in a district that includes Athens and the Augusta suburbs, is a 52-year-old dentist who had been president of the Georgia Dental Association.
Saxby Chambliss, a prominent 50-year-old lawyer from Moultrie in south-central Georgia, won more than 60 percent of the vote against a 32-year-old, underfinanced Democrat, Craig Mathis. The seat was open because Representative J. Roy Rowland, a Democrat who had held it easily for 12 years, retired.
Before the 1992 election, 10 of Georgia's 11 Congressional seats were filled by Democrats -- all but the one held by Newt Gingrich, who is in line to be the next Speaker of the House. Despite the conservative electorate in Georgia, the Democrats kept this advantage in large part because the incumbents used their seniority to bring Federal projects to Georgia and worked hard at serving their constituents. They also had no trouble raising money.
But when the old bulls retired, the Democrats had very little in reserve. Republicans began putting up strong candidates for the open seats. And in cases where Democratic incumbents tried to hold on, Republicans often managed to tie them to the liberal national party. After his defeat Tuesday, Mr. Darden said: "We have lost the white male conservative vote. It's hard to reverse a trend once it sets in."
In the next Congress, seven of Georgia's seats will be filled by Republicans.
"In key seats, the Republicans did a masterly job of recruiting candidates," said former Representative Beryl Anthony Jr. of Arkansas, who was in charge of recruitment of Democrats in the 1988 and 1990 elections. "I expect they did out-campaign us in terms of candidate recruitment this year."
Indeed, for the first time, Republicans had candidates on the ballot in every Congressional district. In 36 districts, no Democrat ran. And in many, the best potential Democratic candidates decided not to run.
In Michigan, for instance, former Gov. James J. Blanchard, who seemed to be the strongest possible candidate for the Senate, decided not to run. Representative Bob Carr, who ran instead, was beaten soundly by Spencer Abraham, a former state Republican chairman.
In Missouri, Gov. Mel Carnahan would probably have given former Gov. John Ashcroft, a Republican, a tough race for the Senate seat opened by John C. Danforth's retirement. But Mr. Carnahan did not run, and Representative Alan Wheat, who did, got clobbered.
"The party of government had a supply problem it never had before, and the party opposed to government didn't have the deficit it used to have," said Mr. Ehrenhalt, who is editor of Governing magazine.
Representative Bill Paxon of upstate New York, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said finding good candidates this year was a cinch because President Clinton was so weak and the enthusiasm of the House Republican leadership so strong.
But the most important long-range consequence of this shift in talent may have come not in Congress but at the state level. Republicans picked up more than 450 seats in state legislatures and won control of 15 new legislative chambers. Republicans now control both chambers in 18 states, Democrats in 19 states. In 12 states, the chambers are split. (The unicameral legislature in Nebraska is nonpartisan.) This is the first time in at least 60 years such parity has existed.
The Republicans, said Thomas E. Mann, director of government studies at the Brookings Institution, "are going to have a real farm team that will have a substantial impact on the party's well-being in the years ahead."
That is the ultimate paradox rising from Tuesday's election. The party whose core philosophy is opposition to government now controls much of the government at every level. And it has a steady stream of candidates who want to maintain that hold.

HEADLINE: Left to Die, the South Bronx Rises From Decades of Decay

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
When Fausto Rodriguez, his wife and three children fled East Harlem two years ago in search of a house in a quieter, safer neighborhood, they headed across the river.
Not the Hudson -- the Harlem. Not to the suburban retreats of New Jersey -- to the South Bronx. 
Mr. Rodriguez, a city police officer assigned to narcotics investigations, knew the rap on the South Bronx as well as anyone, maybe better: lawless, bombed out, drug-infested. But it was the other side of that story -- the less-known tale -- that led him to buy a new house smack in the middle of the enduring symbol of America's urban catastrophe.
In a city full of surprises, few are as striking as the contrast between the 20-year-old image of the burned-out South Bronx and the reality after what officials call the nation's largest urban rebuilding effort. With more than $1 billion in public dollars trained on the South Bronx since 1986, 19,000 apartments have been refurbished, more than 2,500 new houses have been built for working-class home buyers and 2,000 more are under construction.
More than 50 abandoned buildings that once stood like rotten teeth along major arteries like the Cross Bronx and Major Deegan expressways have been reclaimed as mid-rise apartment houses.
Even in the impoverished interior of the South Bronx, where rampant crime inspired the movie "Fort Apache, the Bronx," rows of one- and two-family homes with a suburban feel of vinyl siding, driveways and backyards have reappeared on blocks once burned, abandoned and left for dead.
The outside world has seen only glimpses of the changes: a new development here, a ground-breaking or a ribbon-cutting there. And while many patches of the South Bronx are still decayed and dangerous, the efforts taken together represent a fundamental shift for a section of the city that less than 20 years ago many considered a lost cause.
Mr. Rodriguez said that his fellow police officers "think I'm a little crazy because I moved to the Bronx," but he said the price of the house was good -- $165,000 -- the commute is easy and he feels safe there.
"I'm living pretty well," he said. A shiny maroon Voyager sits on the car pad out front, and inside, the furniture is new, compact discs fill a black rack and there is a small balcony overlooking the basketball court in the backyard.
Three years ago, his neighborhood was one of those urban prairies that telegraphed the desolation of the South Bronx. Now there are about 500 houses that sold at prices from $90,000 to $165,000 to working families who qualified for city and state subsidies. Many have first-floor rental apartments, keeping mortgage payments as low as $500 a month.
Even as the wave of development has swept the South Bronx, large stretches, particularly the Mott Haven section, have been left behind, and there the ravages of crime and drugs and decay have continued unabated. Even in the rebuilt neighborhoods, challenges remain. New stores for the new residents are few. Though crime tends to shy away from new developments, police and residents say, it doesn't migrate far. And amenities from parks to libraries remain scant.
 
A New South Bronx,Hard Against Decay
 Many neighborhoods now look like works in progress, with distinct lines between the new and old South Bronx. On a recent day, Christine Daniels, an unemployed elderly woman wrapped in a large yellow sweater, sat on the porch of her tumble-down home, which had been marked for demolition after a recent fire, and wondered where she would live. Staying seemed out of the question.
All around her were new two-family houses. In the driveway of the house next door was a grey Nissan Sentra and a white Mercedes. Two ornamental lions adorned the wrought iron gate that guarded the house.
"There has been no more dramatic revival of a community in the country," said Paul S. Grogan, the president of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, which aids housing groups nationwide. "It's particularly dramatic because the South Bronx went so far down, down to rubble. If it were more widely known what happened in the South Bronx, it could be a symbol of the possibility of revival."
He attributed the success of the effort to local housing groups that in many cases were involved in financing and marketing the developments and in assisting residents after they move in with everything from maintenance to social services.
 
Affordability And Community
 Kathryn Wylde, the president of the New York City Housing Partnership, which has helped to develop thousands of houses in the South Bronx, said a variety of forces were attracting home buyers. Some are coming because good, affordable homes are scarce in much of the region. Others, particularly Hispanic immigrants, are drawn by a sense of community, not unlike the European immigrants who settled in the Bronx generations ago.
Although the town houses where Mr. Rodriguez and others live are the most visible signs of the new South Bronx, more than 17,000 vacant apartments have been rebuilt in scores of mid-sized buildings whose landlords abandoned them as white residents fled to the northern Bronx and the suburbs in the 1960's and 70's.
In the 1970's, many of those building became fuel for the arson fires that made the South Bronx infamous. But after Mayor Edward I. Koch initiated a $5 billion housing renovation plan in 1986, the city and nonprofit groups began renovating thousands of apartments each year.
"It was the fortuitous coming together of the need to spend the money and the inventory of vacancies," said Samuel Kramer, the director of Bronx planning in the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
 
Some See a Chance To Live a Dream
 Officials say the new housing is largely serving people with enough money to move out of public housing or people who used to live in the South Bronx and are moving back.
"I lived in Spanish Harlem all my life," said David Garcia, a hotel maintenance worker, standing outside his two-family home on a street in Morrisania shared by new homes and old, tattered buildings. "This is a dream. Wouldn't you want to own your own home rather than live in the projects with 10,000 other people?"
Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, said: "We're reversing flight. We're keeping middle- and working-class people in the Bronx."
Some community organizers contend the development has slighted poorer residents. "The approach has been to provide incentives for the moderate- and middle-income people to stay or move in and incentives for the poor people to leave or continue to double up," said Harold DeRienzo, a housing advocate in the South Bronx since the early 1970's.
Helen Schaub, who heads a school advocacy group, said she was repeatedly turned down as a tenant in renovated apartment buildings in the heart of the South Bronx because her $22,000 annual salary was too small.
Mr. Ferrer rejected the criticism, saying poorer people were not being displaced by more affluent residents. The new developments, he said, give working people the opportunity to get a better home without leaving their neighborhoods. "We change the demographics by adding something, not subtracting," he said.
While major highways carry motorists passing through the South Bronx, the renovation has gone largely unnoticed because the area remains isolated, physically and culturally. Few people commute to the South Bronx for work. Population shifts have made Spanish as common as English. And crime statistics, news reports and the ongoing debate over whether baseball fans are wary of going to Yankee Stadium have reinforced the outsiders' view of the South Bronx as fearsome and foreign.
Visitors are invariably surprised by the development. Norbert Figmik, a businessman from Bratislava in the Slovak Republic came to the South Bronx this month envisioning a place too dangerous even for the police and left saying, "I expected very, very bad, much worse than it is."
His expectations were understandable. The South Bronx's reputation was both well-earned and well-broadcast. President Jimmy Carter drew attention to the devastation while visiting a charred and abandoned Charlotte Street in 1977. Ronald Reagan returned in 1980 and said he had not "seen anything that looked like this since London after the Blitz."
Howard Cosell, announcing the 1977 World Series from Yankee Stadium declared "the Bronx is burning" as the camera panned a sky alive with fires. And in the 1981 film "Fort Apache, the Bronx," crime and depravity wear down Officer Murphy, played by Paul Newman, who says: "I'm as burned out as the damn building on Charlotte Street."
But Charlotte Street is now a development of 90 single-family homes on grassy lots that look like they were transported by tornado from Southern California. Metal grating on ground floor windows is the only reminder of their true address.
 
Fruit Trees Sprout, But It's No Eden
 In his backyard there, Joe Santiago, a heating and air-conditioning engineer, grows pears and peaches and apples. "It's like a piece of the country inside the city," he said. "It's not like the 60's or the 70's."
Nor is it a Garden of Eden. Urban ills -- from drug abuse and violence to teen-age pregnancy and illiteracy -- are still epidemic in many South Bronx neighborhoods. The area has among the worst-rated public schools in the city, and police precincts there have some of the city's highest crime rates, after eastern Brooklyn and upper Manhattan.
The Rev. Paul LeBlanc, whose St. Pius V Roman Catholic parish in Mott Haven is overburdened by drugs, AIDS, homelessness and poverty, said the prevailing attitude about the South Bronx used to be "just let it die and, once it has gone, just bulldoze it. That's what I thought would happen." But, he added, "We haven't turned the corner yet. I think maybe we are on one knee."
Just the same, the progress is extraordinary considering the free-fall of the 1970's. Between 1970 and 1980 the population of the South Bronx -- an area that came to be defined as everything below Fordham Road -- plunged by more than 40 percent as over 300,000 people left. In the next decade, the slide ended as the area gained about 26,500 people.
Harvey Katowitz has lived the journey of the South Bronx at every stage. His family moved from Hunts Point in the 1960's when the area was in decline, but he returned as a narcotics officer in the 41st Precinct for less than a year in 1972 when it was known as Fort Apache.
He remembers a Wild West atmosphere of running down drug addicts in rotting tenements and then fighting his way past angry residents after making an arrest. "This was probably the worst precinct to work in probably in the country," he said.
Assigned to another tour there in 1982 as a sergeant, he found the area relatively deserted. Fires had leveled whole blocks.
A decade later, he returned as commanding officer of the precinct. While it has the 10th highest number of homicides of the city's 75 precincts, the area is far calmer and congenial, he said. The precinct house is near a row of new, brick two-family homes in the Longwood Historic District. A new ball field across the street from the homes was the site of a drug-ridden apartment building 20 years ago, Captain Katowitz said.
"When I was here in 1972 we were chasing junkies through the tenements there," he said. "When I drove by this July 3rd, people were setting up for a barbecue and they invited me back the next day. I said, 'Wow, this is different.' "
Since much of the work has been completed since the 1990 census, it is not yet clear how the new housing has affected the social and economic profile of the South Bronx.
But Kevin Nunn, the president of the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, said recent interest by retail chains such as Bradlees and Pathmark in developing South Bronx locations is encouraging.
And new residents see improvements in their neighborhoods.
Frances Ortiz, a bank manager in Manhattan who bought a three-story town house in Mott Haven nearly four years ago, said that within weeks of her arrival "there was a big shootout with rifles and people shooting from the roof. The Sanitation Department forgot about us, and there were a lot of rats. Poor people from the neighborhood thought we were rich people moving in and knocked on our doors and asked for money."
But the situation has improved. The new homeowners were able to get the attention of the city government and the police, and relations between old and new residents have evened out, she said.
And people are beginning to notice. "When cabs take me home at night," she said, "they say: 'This looks so nice. This is the South Bronx?' "

HEADLINE: Clinton Begins Pacific Visit in Manila

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MANILA, Sunday, Nov. 13

 BODY:
President Clinton began a Pacific tour here this morning with somber stops to honor nearly a century of economic and security ties between the United States and the Philippines, its first colony.
With visits to Corregidor Island and an American military cemetery, Mr. Clinton is seeking to honor American-Filipino suffering at the outset of World War II and the fighting that finally liberated the Philippines from Japanese control in the final months of the conflict. 
 "This week the American people told us, all of us here in Washington, to work together, to put politics aside to create a stronger, more secure America," the President said in setting out on his journey. He said his nine-day trip to the Philippines, Indonesia and Hawaii would "give us the unique opportunity to join hands and do just that."
The main focus of Mr. Clinton's trip is expanding trade throughout the Asia-Pacific region, and the conference of regional leaders that begins on Monday near Jakarta will serve as its centerpiece.
Mr. Clinton began his day today with a breakfast for American business executives at which Secretary of State Warren Christopher was the host. He told them that the Export-Import Bank was making available $100 million in new assistance for the Philippines, and his talks with President Fidel Ramos were to include discussions about widening trade between the two countries. Total trade last year was $7.8 billion.
After visiting Italy, Britain and France last summer to commemorate the Allied invasions of Europe 50 years ago, Mr. Clinton was using his only full day in the Philippines in large part to honor veterans of the war in the Pacific.
After arriving here late Saturday night, Mr. Clinton was formally welcomed by President Ramos this morning in a gala ceremony at Malacanang Palace, the one-time residence of American Governors-General, including William Howard Taft. The palace has been the seat of the head of the Philippine Government since the mid-1930's, and Mr. Ramos has lived there since succeeding Corazon C. Aquino in June 1992.
The two Presidents flew later by helicopter to Corregidor, the rocky, four-mile-long island that guards the entrance to Manila Bay and which served as the headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur and the Philippines Government during a siege that lasted nearly five months at the onset of World War II.
The island fortress was held by Japanese forces for nearly three years until it was recaptured by American paratroopers in February 1945, and on this muggy morning, Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, gazed quietly upon the bombed-out barracks and rubbled tunnels that have been left as a memorial.
Among the Clintons' guides was Col. Alfred A. Xerez-Burgos, 76, a Filipino survivor of the Bataan March, in which 60,000 American and Filipino prisoners were forced to travel on foot over a forbidding peninsula just across a narrow channel from Corregidor.
Back in the capital at midday, the Clinton planned a visit to the 152-acre Manila American Cemetery, where 17,206 American and Filipino soldiers are buried. As a United States military graveyard, the cemetery is second in size only to Arlington National Cemetery, and Mr. Clinton planned an address from the memorial at its center, where the names of more than 36,000 American troops missing after the war in the Pacific are inscribed on limestone pillars that form a circular wall.
In remarks prepared for his delivery there, Mr. Clinton praised "the spirit of Bataan and Corregidor," and he declared: "Nothing protects us and our freedom like the vigilance of memory."
This is the fifth time this year that Mr. Clinton has undertaken a foreign tour, and his aides say he is almost certain to visit American soldiers in Haiti and might also fly to Budapest for a summit meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe by year's end. Thus Mr. Clinton could surpass a mark set by George Bush, whose six overseas journeys in 1990 were the most ever by an American President.
But while Mr. Clinton once scorned Mr. Bush for devoting too much attention to foreign affairs, his aides say he will most likely maintain just as heavy a schedule of foreign travel next year. That schedule could increase if the President sees foreign affairs as a refuge from a hostile new Republican Congress, as he has given signs of doing.
Mr. Clinton is the first American President since Gerald R. Ford to visit the Philippines. The trip comes at a time when the two countries are trying to redefine their relationship after the withdrawal in November 1992 of the last United States sailors and Navy vessels. The Philippines refused to renew a lease on the American naval base, at Subic Bay.
An agreement giving formal approval for American warships to refuel and pick up food supplies in the Philippines is to be signed next month, but its disclosure generated sharp complaints this week in the Philippine Senate. A series of small anti-American protests has also been held in advance of Mr. Clinton's visit, with demonstrators contending that the United States should do more to clean up toxic wastes left behind at the Subic base and at Clark Air Base, which was abandoned by the United States after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991.
Among those accompanying Mr. Clinton are Anthony Lake, the national security adviser; Samuel R. Berger, the deputy national security adviser; Robert E. Rubin, assistant for economic policy; Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the counselor to the President, and George Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser.
Leon E. Panetta, the chief of staff, and the rest of Mr. Clinton's political team, including Harold Ickes, the deputy chief of staff, have stayed in Washington to assess the political damage from Tuesday's elections and to begin to devise a strategy for the next two years.

HEADLINE: Anti-Indonesia Protest at U.S. Embassy

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Sunday, Nov. 13

 BODY:
In an incident that raises questions about the security of American diplomatic outposts, 29 unarmed demonstrators climbed over a fence into the United States Embassy compound here on Saturday and have refused to leave in a protest of Indonesia's policies in East Timor.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said at a news briefing on Saturday that Washington has "no plans to throw them out." 
 "We are dealing with the issue with sympathy and understanding as well as firmness," he added.
The demonstrators, described as East Timorese students, took advantage of the gathering of world leaders here for the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to call attention to East Timor, a former Portuguese colony invaded by Indonesia in 1975.
The students chose the embassy as a venue apparently in an attempt to get President Clinton, who is to arrive tonight, to put pressure on the Government over reported repression in East Timor.
A standoff developed, and this morning the students were still camped in an embassy parking lot.
Around 9 A.M. Saturday, the students arrived near the main gate in five taxis, sprinted to the fence and climbed over before any guards could stop them, according to a Reuters reporter who saw the incident.
American officials played down the security threat, saying the protesters had only reached an isolated part of the compound. To get to the main building, they would have had to scale another fence and get past American Marine guards. The outer perimeter is patrolled by Indonesian guards.
"Our hard line is the main Embassy building," Pamela Smith, the embassy spokeswoman, said.
The outer fence is made of vertical metal bars with points. It is about seven feet tall, and stands on a foot-high wall. The fence has horizontal metal bars that climbers can put their feet on.
All embassies made major security overhauls after Iranians scaled the wall of the United States Embassy in Teheran in November 1979 and took 63 employees hostage.
The protest on Saturday came three years after Indonesian troops in Dili, the East Timor capital, gunned down scores of unarmed people who gathered at a cemetery to protest rights conditions. Amnesty International says Indonesia has imposed "two decades of terror," with torture and killings of dissidents.
Some East Timorese are engaged in a guerrilla war for independence. One demand of the protesters here was the release of a rebel leader, Jose Gusmao, who is known as Xanana, from an Indonesian prison.
The economic meetings here have focused attention on Indonesia's rights record. The Government has been accused of suppressing workers' rights and this summer it shut down three news magazines.
United States officials said President Clinton would bring up East Timor when he meets with President Suharto. But Washington has been cautious about calling too much attention to human rights in order to maintain economic ties.
The United States Government and the demonstrators have received assurances from Indonesia that there will be no reprisals after the youths leave the embassy grounds, but the Timorese say they will not leave.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Riots in East Timor
 DILI, Indonesia, Sunday, Nov. 13 (AP) -- Hundreds of pro-independence youths rampaged today through Dili, the capital of East Timor, breaking windows, burning debris and chasing away Indonesian riot police. After a Mass just prior to the protests, demonstrators unfurled banners and chanted "Viva Clinton."
At least 300 students armed with clubs and sticks overran the Turismo Hotel, but there were no immediate reports of injuries.
Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976. The United Nations never recognized the annexation. The United States has, but has protested that East Timor's people have not been given a chance at self-determination. The Timorese are predominately Roman Catholic; the Indonesians are 85 percent Muslim.

HEADLINE: Wooed and Won, Clinton Finds Open Arms in Manila

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MANILA, Sunday, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Fidel V. Ramos wooed Bill Clinton and won him over.
The Philippine President was not pleased last fall when Mr. Clinton said he would have to turn down the invitation to attend celebrations in October marking the World War II liberation of the Philippines from Japanese occupation. He would be out campaigning, Mr. Clinton said. 
 So Mr. Ramos sent Mr. Clinton boxes of hand-rolled cigars made of tobacco from Luzon Province and custom-made golf balls engraved with their names. He made sure the White House had bound copies of his speeches and policy statements, dedicated to Mr. Clinton's "mabuha" -- long life.
And when Vice President Al Gore located Mr. Ramos in Paris several weeks ago to ask him to help out in Haiti, Mr. Ramos sent 50 military policemen.
Mr. Clinton responded by agreeing to come, a little late perhaps, but no matter. He is being welcomed not as a battered political warrior but as a visionary leader who will be treated kindly by history.
"I have the intention to tell him all the great appreciation we have for him through his own personality and dedicated statesmanship, especially his role in achieving the breakthrough in the peace process in the Middle East and Haiti," Mr. Ramos said in an interview just before Mr. Clinton arrived. "We also applaud his economic policy, returning American economically back to the way of growth. I do believe that history will recognize the achievements of Bill Clinton."
But the judgment of history will not do much to help Mr. Clinton now. So Mr. Ramos, who used to entertain his friends by parachuting into his own birthday parties, will do his best to try to cheer him up.
"When I toast him at the banquet, I will quote from Luke 4:24 -- 'No prophet is accepted in his hometown,' " he said.
Mr. Ramos should know. The former commander of the national police under Ferdinand E. Marcos was transformed into a democrat when, as army Chief of Staff, he abandoned his leader (and second cousin) and supported the democratically elected Government of Corazon C. Aquino.
After he helped Mrs. Aquino put down seven coup attempts, he decided to run for President himself. He won in a six-way race in 1992 with only 23.5 percent of the vote.
Now Mr. Ramos is making the most of the fact that for one brief day his country is in the spotlight.
When he visited Mr. Clinton in Washington during an eight-city tour last November, he estimated that the trip would be worth $3 billion in American investment. This time, he said, the value of a Clinton visit is incalculable.
Mr. Ramos tells the success story to anyone who will listen: How a country with a history of poverty, corruption, civil rebellion, foreign indebtedness and tax evasion is emerging as an economic dynamo.
Against all predictions, he has moved to reform the economy, increase business confidence, start peace talks with rebels and grapple with over-population.
"The Philippines should be recognized as the national gateway to the Pacific," he said.
What he wants from America, he says, is "trade not aid." Not that there is much money available. In 1991, Washington gave the Philippines more than half a billion dollars in aid; in 1994, it was $60 million.
Forgotten is the bad feeling between Washington and Manila in 1991 when the former colony's Senate voted to evict American troops from two bases that housed more than 20,000 Americans and was the heart of the American military presence in Southeast Asia. Now Subic Bay, a 45,000-acre former naval base, has become an "economic zone" that is touted as an ideal investment location.
So caught up is Mr. Ramos in the euphoria of Mr. Clinton's visit that he did not automatically reject the idea of permanently anchoring an American floating war depot off the coast of the Philippines. Should the United States make the same proposal that was recently rejected by Thailand, he said, he would be happy to have experts at lower levels discuss it.
But Mr. Ramos, a West Point graduate who used to be termed an "American boy" in the Philippine press, has no intention of bending too low to Washington's wishes. Obviously, he said, a base, whether floating or on land, is already denied in advance by the fact that the Philippine Senate did not ratify the proposed extension of the United States-Philippine base agreement.
The 66-year-old President feels he enjoys a close relationship with Mr. Clinton. "He sent me a personally written Christmas card last December," Mr. Ramos says. "He signs letters to me as Bill."
A Methodist who keeps a statue of the Madonna in his office, Mr. Ramos said that both he and Mr. Clinton were "religious men.
"We are also indifferent golfers, sometimes good and sometimes bad," he said. "We are workaholics, that is very true. And when the President said, 'It's the economy, stupid,' it's the same as when we say, 'Let's give priority to economic growth, sustained progress and sustainable development.' "

HEADLINE: Republicans Plan to Guide Foreign Policy by Purse String

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
In foreign policy, a domain traditionally run by the executive branch, Republican leaders in Congress say they plan to use the power of the purse to rein in President Clinton on several fronts, like cutting foreign aid or restricting funds for peacekeeping.
Setting the tone, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who is in line to become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, outlined an approach distinctly different from Mr. Clinton's, one displaying far more skepticism toward foreign aid and the United Nations. 
 "The foreign aid program has spent an estimated $2 trillion of the American taxpayers' money, much of it going down foreign rat-holes, to countries that constantly oppose us in the United Nations, and many which rejected concepts of freedom," Mr. Helms said at a news conference this week.
He and other Republican leaders said they planned to follow through on promises to reduce the size of the Agency for International Development and to allow American troops to be used in United Nations missions under foreign command only when the missions involve vital national interests.
They also pledged to cut back the President's plans to double financing for population-control programs overseas and to reduce the amount of money that Washington contributes to United Nations peacekeeping operations to 25 percent of the total, from 32 percent.
"There will be some difficult issues that have a partisan edge," said Lee H. Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who is now chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. "Funding the U.N. is one area where we could have some differences, and another is what restrictions to put on before the U.S. enters into U.N. peacekeeping arrangements."
Despite their new majority status, the Republicans' vow to toughen scrutiny of foreign policy in large measure will consist of tinkering around the edges, because the President is diplomat in chief and Commander in Chief. Administration officials said that if the Republican Congress sought to dictate foreign policy, then President Clinton would not flinch at using his veto power.
Several officials said they did not expect the Republicans to unduly tie the President's hands because Republican experts on foreign policy, like Senator John McCain of Arizona and Bob Dole, who is to become Senate majority leader, have long defended Presidential prerogatives.
Republicans have also indicated that they will seek either to slash the size of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, which provides the Government with expertise on arms control, or abolish it. Mr. Helms has indicated that he will seek to reject several treaties, like the international environmental treaty and the Law of the Seas treaty. Republicans have opposed the effort to regulate the world's seas since the Reagan Administration.
Among Republicans, a common thread is that President Clinton consulted far too little with Congress, and with Congressional Republicans in particular, and was far too uninhibited in sending troops abroad.
"We've been rushing headlong into too many of these areas," said Benjamin A. Gilman, a New York Republican who is to become chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. "It's extremely important that the President have the support of the Congress and of the American people before moving headlong into these areas."
In a policy document signed by most Republican House candidates, the Republicans promised to seek legislation placing stringent conditions on using American troops as part of United Nations peacekeeping missions under foreign command.
Several Administration officials said the conditions, like permitting troops to be sent only if vital national interests are involved, were so strict that they would in effect preclude joining such missions. If a problem involves vital national interests, then the United States would act unilaterally or set up a multilateral force outside the United Nations, these officials said.
Pointing to President Clinton's decision to send 20,000 troops to Haiti, a decision Republicans overwhelming opposed, Republican lawmakers say one of their goals will be to force the President to define his objectives better before sending troops abroad.
"I would urge that we establish a far clearer doctrine of linking our national interests to the deployment of troops overseas," said Senator John W. Warner of Virgina, a member of the Armed Services Committee.
A big question is how partisan the Republicans' foreign policy will be. Some foreign policy experts say that if Mr. Helms determines the Republicans' position, it will be highly partisan; others say that if Republicans line up behind moderates like Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana or Mr. Warner, their approach will be more bipartisan.
State Department officials also acknowledge that the Republican takeover of Congress might make it harder to get ambassadorial nominations confirmed. Mr. Helms singlehandedly blocked the nomination of Robert A. Pastor to be ambassador to Panama this year, and Administration officials say they may let Mr. Helms vet some nominations before they are formally announced to avoid such embarrassments.

An Actress Who Belongs To the Risk

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

 BODY:
"WHY does the actor not look out of the window first thing in the morning?" asks Rosaleen Linehan, setting up an old joke told by actors about their frequent states of unemployment. "Because he'd have nothing to do for the rest of the day," she responds, her laughter bell-like across the idleness that's pretty much in the past for her now that she's a world-class actress.
Well, she is, even if she'd be the last to say so after working 35 years at acting, always wondering whether she'd get each job, then whether she was up to each role, and often being surprised along with the watching audiences at her own inventions. Acting is the life for her, and New York, "so buzzy and so beautiful," she says, is the place to try it once more. 
 Ms. Linehan was last in New York as Kate, the tough-spirited elder among the wistful sisters of "Dancing at Lughnasa," the international stage success by her Irish countryman Brian Friel. "I've never written a word of irony and I don't intend to," Mr. Friel once instructed her at a rehearsal, disciplining the very nature of the actress and her saucy, sarcastic outlook on life.
"That was devastating from such a mystical figure," Ms. Linehan recalls, still saucy enough. "I took off the irony. What do you do when God speaks? I was raised a good Catholic girl to do what I was told."
Even more, she was raised to be a civil servant, forbidden by her father to be an actress. Yet she managed to sneak off to become a Lenny-tempting floozy in "Of Mice and Men," and all sorts of other characters.
And now she is back in New York at the Irish Repertory Theater portraying "Mother of All the Behans": Kathleen Behan, a singular Irish woman, at once a fervid Catholic, flinty Communist and passionate republican of the Irish uprising. In the poverty of Dublin, she was a neighborhood balladeer and free-thinking matriarch. Her brood of seven included Brendan Behan, the playwright, whose sproutings of lyric genius, rowdiness and iconoclasm were sown by Kathleen. Joe Stalin sounds akin to Mother Machree in the Soviet anthem belted out by Ms. Linehan's Kathleen.
"She sounds like I hope I sound," the actress says, discussing a woman who began haunting her seven years ago when the one-character show premiered, based on Brian Behan's memoir. "I drift in and out of that sound," she explains of hearing an old interview with Mrs. Behan broadcast in Ireland when she was 92 and was measured a national treasure. "Her voice becomes very young and very vibrant across the show," she says of the time trip of the play. "But it has to be based totally on the death moment, if you like, the old Kathleen. I'm in and out of that sound, always getting back to that."
PART of the fun of theater is trying to figure out where the actors come from to be trying this, and how frightened they get in the risk. "I think it's awfully funny when you get these cuckoos in the nest," says Ms. Linehan, making a summary of her fellow cuckoos worthy of Mother Behan. "I mean, backstage on the first night there's always this huge percentage of embarrassed parents, very well dressed, visiting their Bohemian children, wondering where they got them from."
Born a character, be a character. She thinks she gets changed a bit by each role, so that she is a different actress when she gets to the next one. Her revival of Mrs. Behan may have an aspect not just of Kate from "Lughnasa" but also of Scarlett O'Hara's scheming housemaid, a kind of Fenian Butterfly McQueen character that she plays in the "Gone With the Wind" sequel that begins tonight on television.
"I'm always so grateful for having an audience," Ms. Linehan admits of it all. "What I like about acting at this stage is different from what I first liked," she says. "Kathleen says, 'It's not family or money that keeps you in a place, it's the belonging.' That was it: being totally comfortable with stage people bringing out the most in themselves, a glorious thing to find. But now that I am an actress, all the time at acting is really about trying to be better and keep the concentration and energy levels correct."
Kathleen Behan prods the actress forward. "I have a lot of plays to do and all that I've done has been leading up to the character I've been preparing all my life for, and that's Mary Tyrone in 'Long Day's Journey Into Night,' " she says of whom she'll next be.
"The thing is not to get frightened of it," the actress says in an aside to herself, sounding frightened.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: Cuomo, a Mystery in an Enigma in a Politician, and His Final Race;
Friends Look for an Answer

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

 BODY:
After all the years in which the riddle about Gov. Mario M. Cuomo was why he didn't (run for President, take a Supreme Court nomination), the question that lingers after his defeat is why he did (run for a fourth term that it was clear he would have a hard time winning).
The short answer is that the Governor, reluctant to withdraw from the fray after a third term in which a recession had sapped his popularity and forced him to manage scarcity, saw running again as the best way to secure a legacy that already loomed as too intangible, and thus end on a high note. 
 The more complex answer is that in forsaking glittering opportunities on the national stage, Mr. Cuomo squarely boxed himself into the one job that consumed and compelled him, and that his aides and friends say he loved, albeit in such a brooding way that they were never sure he actually enjoyed it. In interviews this week, those friends groped for answers.
"Oh, I don't know," said David Garth, his campaign strategist and a political foil of 20 years' standing. "About everyone I know with any intelligence, including his family, wanted him to take the Court. But with Mario, there's a big contrary streak. If the crowd's going one way, he wants to go the other."
The Governor's former press secretary, Gary G. Fryer, was equally succinct.
"I think a lot of people spend a lot of time analyzing Mario Cuomo, contemplating his moves, and I think a lot of that cottage industry is unnecessary," said Mr. Fryer, now director of public affairs at Yale University. "He's far more simple than people think he is, and the answer can be summed up in the word 'service.'
"I know that sounds Pollyanna-ish," Mr. Fryer said. "But the reality is this is a guy who got to high office against the odds. He loves what he does. He eats, breathes and lives the responsibilities that go with it. I'm not even sure it's enjoyable for him. It's what he does."
This is, after all, a man whose wife once said that living with him was like being domiciled with a legal brief, so rigorous was his logic, so endlessly could he argue a point, any point.
A politician of Mr. Cuomo's acuity could read the bad omens in his narrow 53 percent victory against splintered opposition four years ago, in his rising negative poll ratings, in the historical audacity implicit in even contemplating a fourth four-year term; something only one state governor in American history, Nelson A. Rockefeller, had ever won until Mr. Cuomo's Republican contemporary, Terry E. Branstad, did so in Iowa last week.
Indeed, Mr. Cuomo took deliberate steps to reconsider a future that had seemed wide open since he burst into national stardom at the Democratic Convention in 1984 and passed up a run for the White House in 1988. In 1991, he flirted more seriously, and perhaps dangerously, with the Presidency. He went so far as to allow two chartered planes to wait on an Albany runway on a December Friday to take him to New Hampshire in time to file for the primary there, but never left the ground.
A year later, upon the victory of Bill Clinton, who had once derided him as a mean Mafia-like figure, then cited his name as the sort who would make a good Supreme Court justice, the Governor was concerned enough about his future to seek out members of Mr. Clinton's transition team to ascertain if Mr. Clinton meant what he said about the Court.
"He called to ask if the President was serious, to say that 'I must figure out what to do with the rest of my life, this has got to figure in my equation,' " said one person close to both Mr. Cuomo and the President, speaking on condition of anonymity. "And the word came back that, 'Yes, we were serious, but there's not a vacancy now.' "
For his part, Mr. Cuomo said: "I don't remember that. I mean, I wouldn't deny it, but I don't remember it. And it's not like me to have brought it up."
What is clear is that a few months later, in spring 1993 when a vacancy did occur and Mr. Clinton called to discuss it, friends of both say the Governor cut him short with a list of reasons why he could not do it: it would be too isolating, he wasn't a constitutional lawyer, he was too young to enter a cloistered world.
"His words to me were, 'I feel as though my tongue would be cut out,' " one friend recalled last week.
At least one friend of both men thinks the nomination may have fallen victim to miscommunication between Mr. Clinton, who did not quite understand that Mr. Cuomo was willing to be begged, and Mr. Cuomo, who was unwilling to be auditioned or to beg himself. But most of the Governor's advisers sharply dispute that notion, saying that Mr. Cuomo was genuinely put off by the confinement the Court implied.
Once such options were foreclosed, the decision to run again came to seem logical, if not inevitable, though many of those closest to him, including his most trusted political adviser, his son Andrew, strongly advised against it.
"He felt very strongly about the fact that he has an unfinished agenda, that he got robbed of a lot of the years he had because of the recessions," said his old friend and confidant, Meyer S. Frucher. "He also felt very strongly that his ability to play a role in the debate that's going on in this country about the direction of the country would be enhanced by having the office."
Asked in a five-hour interview this fall about the impression, widepread among other politicians and journalists, that he was running for Governor again because he could not decide what else to do, Mr. Cuomo scoffed.
"Who?" he demanded. "Who? What screwballs are wasting their time cerebrating about the arcane workings of my psyche?"
The reality is that for a man to whom rationale was so often all, Mr. Cuomo was at some pains to build a compelling case for his re-election. To recite a record of which he was proud, while acknowledging that no one or two things stood out, was to invite derision, his aides warned. To promise grand things for the future was to invite harsh skepticism about why they had not already been done. To promise to keep on keeping on proved not enough.
"I wrote him a memo last November, before either of us knew if we were going to run again," said his loyal second, Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine. "I said 'It's going to be tough, it will be Cuomo versus Cuomo, they will try to come up with a candidate who doesn't in any way deflect from that, they will make your record, our record, the issue. We can't win by trying to argue that the status quo is O.K.' "
None of that was a surprise to his boss, Mr. Lundine said. "Even though we knew it was going to be tough, we probably underestimated the depth of people's alienation and insecurity."
This summer, when Mr. Cuomo's campaign was stalled, many prominent Democrats complained that he should have stepped aside for a fresher face, though none said so publicly. Mr. Cuomo always insisted that since the campaign would be about him and his incumbency, he was best equipped to defend it.
Toward the end, the Governor took to finishing his speeches with a stirring peroration, composed of a series of declarations that began: "I want to be Governor because," followed by examples of his commitment to protecting the civil rights and liberties of groups that helped New York pioneer such concepts for the nation.
But what most improved the Governor's standing in the horse race against George E. Pataki were snide ads linking the Republican nominee to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, and if Mr. Cuomo had won, he would have done so in no small measure by resorting to some of the coarsened discourse he said he detested.
"This is a sea change," said Mr. Lundine's chief of staff, Deborah Sale, thoughtful on the morning after the morning after Mr. Cuomo's defeat. "People were just upset and wanted a change. For us to believe that we could elect Mario Cuomo, who's been in office for 12 years, and who's been in politics for 20 years, in the face of all that was probably a little foolish."

The Number of U.S. Farms Falls Below 2 Million

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

 BODY:
From Thomas Jefferson to Grant Wood, Americans have thought of their farmers as something special: stolid, valuable, virtuous. Now they are so few. Last week the Census Bureau announced that the number of American farms had dipped below 2 million for the first time since 1850, when Millard Fillmore was President. The shrinkage has been a long-term trend caused mainly by more efficient production and the economic contretemps of the early to mid-1980's that forced many farmers into bankruptcy.
But if the 1,925,300 farms are much fewer than in past years, the farmers operating them are much better at it than they were a scant decade ago when declining land values, huge crop surplus and plunging commodity prices touched off the largest round of foreclosures since the Great Depression. Lower interest rates, the salutary effects on exports of a declining dollar and an economic recovery in the third world, and bumper crops helped revive many farms . 
 "We've seen quite a substantial turnaround on the part of most producers," said Mark Drabenstott, vice president and economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City. "We've logged some very high-income years in the late 80's and the early 90's." STEVEN A. HOLMES

Talks Halt As Owners Map a New Proposal

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RYE BROOK, N.Y., Nov. 12

 BODY:
Negotiators for baseball's striking players and owners made it into the third consecutive day of renewed talks today, then suddenly adjourned to give the owners' bargaining team more time to develop a proposal it will present when they reconvene.
Shepherded by Bill Usery Jr., the mediator who kept them here this long, the two sides will gather again Thursday at a conference center near Dulles Airport in the Washington area. 
 John Harrington, the owners' chief spokesman, said the owners would bring a new proposal with them. He declined to discuss what the proposal may include, but it is expected to call for a luxury tax on payrolls instead of the salary cap that has been on the table since June 14 as the owners' only proposal to this point.
The owners apparently had a proposal ready to place on the table at the Doral Arrowwood Friday, but Usery persuaded them to keep it in their briefcases, fearing that the proposal, retaining the cap concept, would be counterproductive and possibly bring an instant end to this round of talks.
Harrington, the Boston Red Sox's chief executive, said the new proposal would rise out of a better understanding of the players' concerns that the owners gained at these meetings, but it just as likely will come from the owners' desire to position themselves with a more realistic proposal to implement unilaterally if and when -- sometime next month -- they declare an impasse in the negotiations.
The owners could not implement their proposal of last June 14 because it guarantees the players $1 billion of the clubs' revenue. That guarantee was based on a projected $1.78 billion in revenues for 1994, but the strike that ended the season prematurely and wiped out the World Series reduced that revenue to a total of around $1.2 billion.
Usery, who became involved in the strike-bound talks at the request of the Clinton administration, had intended to keep the two sides meeting through Sunday. But he saw the wisdom of adjourning early, and the negotiators departed today after spending only 15 minutes together.
"I hope I'm correct in the belief that the owners learned some things from the players yesterday that will help them adjust their proposal so that we might achieve an agreement," Usery said.
The luxury-tax concept has been discussed informally by people on both sides. The subject came up at Friday's session, but no specifics were discussed. The players themselves proposed two months ago a tax of about 1.5 percent on the clubs with the 16 highest payrolls, with the money to be distributed to the teams with the 10 lowest revenues, but the clubs immediately rejected the plan.
Payrolls taxes are also at the center of the dispute in the National Hockey League, and, just as the hockey players have done, the baseball players are virtually certain to reject that kind of plan because they would see it as having the same effect as a salary cap.
Because of the change in economics, the owners would probably find it more workable to have a tax system than a salary cap. With the drastic reduction in revenue, some clubs with high payrolls would face great difficulty in reducing those payrolls to conform to a reduced payroll cap.
In an effort to develop a new proposal, the owners' committee met until 11:30 P.M. Friday, then resumed at 8 A.M. today. Usery joined them at 9:30. The two sides finally got together after noon and departed 15 minutes later.
Harrington said he knew that a salary cap was one of the players' concerns. "They know about our concerns about labor costs," he added. "We'll try to marry both concerns as close as we can."
When Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader, was asked what would have to be in a proposal to get the players' attention, he said: "At this stage they know from us what is important, what the concerns are, what we believe is appropriate conceptually and to a certain extent specifically. They've indicated they've listened very carefully to what we've had to say the last several days. We'll wait and see."
Harrington said the owners would make a new proposal without concern for unilateral implementation. He also said that the clubs' lawyers have advised them that they could make a new proposal but still implement a previous one if they wanted.
The clubs could ask the union to agree to such a move, but there's virtually no chance the union would agree.

HEADLINE: Deadly Gifts to Greece and Turkey

 BODY:
In recent years U.S. arms have poured into Greece and Turkey, making them two of the biggest recipients of America's lethal largesse. The United Nations arms registry reveals that in 1992 and 1993 the U.S. turned over 1,163 tanks and 23 combat aircraft to Greece and 1,509 tanks, 54 fighter planes and 28 heavily armed attack helicopters to Turkey.
All of these weapons were slated for reduction under the 1990 treaty on conventional forces in Europe. Instead of scrapping them, the Pentagon is giving them away. 
 What is the U.S. getting in return?
Greece continues to impose an economic embargo on neighboring Macedonia, threatening to destabilize the newly independent Balkan republic and jeopardize the lives of hundreds of American peacekeepers stationed there. The Greek Government has also muzzled dissent at home, reports Human Rights Watch, rounding up its own citizens who dare to speak out against its machinations in Macedonia.
Turkey, meanwhile, still provides bases for U.S. aircraft to patrol northern Iraq and protect Iraqi Kurds, but it is not enforcing the U.N. embargo on Iraq vigorously. At the same time, Turkey has escalated its war against its own Kurdish minority, turning southeastern Turkey into a free-fire zone. Turkey may have used U.S.-made Cobra attack helicopters and F-16 fighter planes to depopulate entire villages in an effort to suppress Kurdish separatists. It is also using smaller but no less lethal U.S. arms, not accounted for in the U.N. registry. So far the fighting has claimed 13,000 lives, according to Human Rights Watch, and forced an equal number of Kurds to seek refuge in Iraq.
The parliament of Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus, with Ankara's encouragement, has hardened its stance on a settlement in Cyprus. With no resolution in sight there and the ever-present risk of a wider war in the Balkans, there is a danger that Athens and Ankara may again come to blows, turning U.S. arms on each other.
The Pentagon euphemistically refers to the flow of arms to Greece and Turkey as "cascading" -- as if it were doing what comes naturally. Yet there is nothing natural about arming allies who act increasingly against U.S. interests. The flow of arms to both countries should cease.

HEADLINE: In America;
A Simple Case of Fraud

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The beauty of Ronald Reagan, Newt Gingrich and so many other Republicans is that they make it all sound so simple.
If the Republicans can reduce taxes, increase defense spending, balance the budget, get people off welfare, reconstitute the American family and accelerate the current reduction in crime -- if they can do all that -- they deserve to be in power. God bless them. They should be running the world. 
 But if you walk the streets of urban America, where the punishing effects of the Reagan-Bush years are most stark, you will be overwhelmed by the evidence that the Republicans cannot do what they are promising. America's cities are the encampments for the most seriously sick and wounded of the last Republican revolution -- the Reagan revolution.
On Thursday, an unemployed plumber's assistant who lives in a doorway in the East New York section of Brooklyn said bitterly: "I don't care who won the election. They can't do no worse to us."
He was wrong. The Democrats were no prize, but the Republican Party is approximately as friendly to the cities as the Visigoths were to Rome. When the next Congress is sworn in the Republicans will resume their war on urban America with a vengeance, targeting especially the elderly, the poor and the very young.
"You will see that this will be a dark time for the cities," said a high-ranking national Democrat, who asked not to be identified. "The Reagan Administration launched a vicious attack on urban programs. Most programs were eliminated, or downsized to the point where they became totally ineffective. Politically, the Republicans have no motivation to solve urban America's problems. They have no constituency there. For the Republicans, the urban scene is the embodiment of all that is wrong with America."
But it is not just the cities that face serious trouble. The G.O.P. message, so simple and attractive, is a fraud. Mr. Gingrich is grinning like the Cheshire cat because he's put one over on the country. Complex problems like underemployment, the budget deficit, inadequate health care and crime will not yield to simple-minded solutions. Many of the voters who joined in Tuesday's orgiastic backlash against Bill Clinton are going to find that they cast their ballots against their own interests.
What the Republicans are good at is siphoning money from the lower and middle classes and funneling it to the wealthy. In the introduction to his book, "The Politics of Rich and Poor," Kevin Phillips wrote, "Despite the armies of homeless sleeping on grates, political leaders -- even those who professed to care about the homeless -- had little to say about the Republican Party's historical role, which has been not simply to revitalize U.S. capitalism but to tilt power, policy, wealth and income toward the richest portions of the population."
That was in 1990. Here we go again. Representative Bill Archer of Texas, who will likely become chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, wants to abolish the Federal income tax, replacing it with something more regressive, like a national sales tax. This would be an incredible boon to the rich, and would hurt virtually everybody else by making all consumer goods much more expensive.
Mr. Archer has also expressed his disdain for the whole idea of universal health coverage, which he derides as "socialized medicine."
Meanwhile, Mr. Gingrich is gleefully readying his plans for tax cuts for the rich and service cuts for the poor.
You can't blame the Republicans. Why should they change the bait when the fish keep biting? But what about the Democrats? What do they do now?
The first thing they should do is stop pretending to be Republicans. The Democrats were so busy running away from their President, their party and their traditional supporters that they never were able to benefit from the successes of the last two years.
The Republicans had a simple-minded message, but the Democrats had no message at all. Throughout the country Democratic candidates pointed to Bill Clinton and said, "We're not with him," and they pointed to traditional Democratic voters and said, "We're not with them."
It's hard for politicians to win when they are ashamed of their base. It may be that the voters who spoke loudest on Tuesday were the voters who stayed home.

To the Editor:
Re "When a Woman Earns Like a Man" (The Week in Review, Nov. 6): According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, women's earnings have risen to 77 percent of men's, significantly more than your 70 percent. In addition, nearly one-third of working married women earn more than their spouses, another rising proportion. 
 The closing gap between women's and men's earnings, even as women's labor force participation rates have leveled off and men's have dropped, means women will have personal options, such as whom to marry or when to unmarry, that men have long had. What if men were expected to marry for financial support and women for companionship and a household? Is this closer than you think?

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
After a campaign in which voters rewarded a barrage of anti-welfare attacks, both parties are now calling the issue a top priority, and both are repeating stern promises to make recipients work.
As the smoke clears from the new political landscape, Democrats and Republicans each appear ready to cut benefits, increase work obligations and provide fewer protections for the 14.3 million people who rely on Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main Federal welfare program. More than nine million of the recipients are children. 
 In his first public remarks after the Democrats' electoral debacle, President Clinton emphasized the toughness of the welfare bill he proposed this spring, calling it "quite similar to one that several Republicans themselves have proposed."
But the talk of common ground masks profound differences between Mr. Clinton and his Republican opponents, particularly Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who is poised to become the next Speaker of the House.
Mr. Clinton's bill would require people who stayed on the A.F.D.C. rolls for more than two years to join a work program. But those who worked could continue to receive aid.
And Mr. Clinton would preserve the broad array of food, housing and disability programs that, in the eyes of their defenders, act as a crucial safety net between needy people and destitution.
Mr. Gingrich, by contrast, describes such programs not as the strands of a safety net but as the teeth of a trap that lures the poor into self-destructive behavior.
He would allow states to end assistance to large numbers of A.F.D.C. recipients, whether or not they were willing to join a work program. He would use some of the money to build orphanages or group homes for the children of those families rendered destitute.
But Mr. Gingrich's proposal goes beyond the main Federal welfare program. Indeed, some Republicans estimate that over the next five years his proposal could translate into cuts of roughly $40 billion or more in food, housing and income programs, including those that serve the disabled and the indigent elderly.
On Friday, Mr. Gingrich said that the programs promote a "counterculture value system" and "ruin the poor."
Given the Republican sweep on Tuesday, the momentum for far-reaching changes appears strong. Welfare rolls are at near-record levels, and Mr. Gingrich collected the support of more than 300 Republican candidates when he outlined his plan in the "Contract With America," the campaign document listing measures Republicans promised to vote on in the first 100 days of the next Congress.
But there are also counterbalancing pressures. Behind the scenes, Republicans clashed angrily among themselves when drafting the contract, with some members of the party arguing it went too far in a punitive direction. The proposals would probably face an uphill fight in the Senate, where institutional rules give Democrats more leverage.
And public support is fickle: the same voters who clamor in opinion polls for a crackdown on "welfare spending" show much less support when the issue is defined as "reducing aid to the poor," especially poor children.
Nonetheless, the balance of power unmistakably shifted this week toward provisions that would withdraw assistance (but risk harming children) and away from those that offer more protections (but preserve elements of the unloved status quo).
Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr. of Florida is among those Republicans who said Mr. Gingrich's plan to substitute orphanages for welfare checks could prove "unduly harsh." But Mr. Shaw did not seek to minimize the number of families who could lose aid under his own proposal for a strict work program, saying "some people are going to fall through the cracks."
Mr. Shaw, who is likely to head the Ways and Means subcommittee responsible for welfare legislation, described such failures as the price to be paid in fixing a broken system. "It may be like hitting a mule with a two-by-four, but you've got to get their attention," he said.
The debate over public assistance -- which sometimes seems to have the accelerating force of a snowball running downhill -- began during the 1992 Presidential campaign, when Mr. Clinton promised to "end welfare as we know it." He pledged to expand the training that recipients could get in their first two years, then require those still unemployed to join a work program.
But after assuming office, Mr. Clinton waited 17 months before producing a bill, in part because he hoped first to push through a program of universal health insurance. He has argued that welfare recipients will not be able to survive on entry-level jobs without the promise of health care.
Republicans disagree and have pushed forward their own end-welfare plans with no promises about health care. A bill sponsored by 164 House Republicans would create a much larger work program than Mr. Clinton envisioned, spending $20 billion over five years on child care, training and supervision. It would raise the money by denying all aid to legal immigrants.
But that proposal was in turn attacked as a big government solution by a smaller faction of Congressional Republicans, led by Representative James M. Talent of Missouri. They have argued that work programs are wasteful and that the Government should instead simply abolish benefits to discourage unmarried women from having children in the first place.
Mr. Talent would permanently deny payments to children born to mothers younger than 26. States could use the money instead to care for children in orphanages or other group settings. While as recently as a year ago, such talk was considered far too radical for mainstream politics, it is edging into the prime-time debate.
Mr. Talent has said the move would sharply cut the number of out-of-wedlock births. But critics conjure up visions of Dickensian England or the modern de-institutionalization of the mentally ill, warning the move would dump hordes of needy families into the streets.
In the Contract With America, the Republican factions temporarily compromised. The plan outlined in the document would enroll 1.5 million recipients in a work program by 2000, but it would also allow states to abolish benefits to mothers younger than 21.
It remains unclear which Republican faction will gain the upper hand.
Mr. Shaw, who is skeptical about abolishing benefits to adults, said the idea was also opposed by most Republican governors, who fear they could inherit responsibility for the dispossessed families. "The states don't want us to just dump our problems on them," Mr. Shaw said.
But Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is likely to lead the Ways and Means Committee, reacted favorably when asked about the provision this week. "We're going to have to face that, we're going to have to face the fact of illegitimacy," he said.
Bruce Reed, a White House welfare adviser, said the Administration remained opposed to proposals like Mr. Talent's that would abolish benefits. "We've said all along that the provision would cause more problems than it solves," he said.
Two other crucial issues are likely to separate Democrats and Republicans in coming months. One is the structure of a work program. The Administration's bill allows recipients to remain in the program indefinitely, as long as they are making good-faith efforts to find private jobs.
The theory is that in an economy with 7.6 million unemployed workers, some welfare recipients will remain unable to find jobs, particularly in areas of high unemployment. Welfare recipients typically have little education or few skills, and many employers shun them.
Mr. Gingrich's plan, by contrast, allows states to drop recipients from the rolls completely within two years, leaving them with neither welfare nor the work program. How many of the nation's five million welfare recipients will then find jobs on their own? "Some will, some won't," said Mr. Shaw, who supports the two-year cutoff. "But more people will be helped than hurt."
The second issue involves the fundamental size and structure of anti-poverty programs. The Clinton plan allows states to reduce some welfare payments by denying extra payments to families that have additional children, for instance.
But the Clinton plan does not seek wholesale cuts, and it does not affect programs like Supplemental Security Income, which provides $23 billion a year in payments to the disabled and the indigent elderly.
By contrast, Mr. Gingrich would limit the growth of both programs and convert them from entitlements into discretionary programs. Under his plan, the programs would provide finite assistance on a first-come, first-serve basis, instead of providing benefits to all who qualify, as they now do.
This could lead to long waiting lists for needy families, like those for housing programs, where waits can last years. Mr. Gingrich would also limit the growth of housing and nutrition programs.
Bloodied by the ballot-box defeat this week, Democrats avoided public criticism of the Republican plans, eager to avoid any hint that they opposed welfare changes. They seem to hope the Republicans will moderate themselves and give Mr. Clinton a bill he can sign. "We should wait for the Congressional debate to unfold," said Mr. Reed, the White House aide.

REMEMBERING ELIZABETH BISHOP
An Oral Biography.
By Gary Fountain and Peter Brazeau.
Illustrated. 408 pp. Amherst:
University of Massachusetts Press.
$35. 
EXCEPT among her fellow poets and her friends within the narrow literary precincts, Elizabeth Bishop (1911-79) was never famous in her lifetime. She resented the neglect. She had won virtually every major award in sight, but she felt, rightly, that she had been denied the celebrity given her male peers; she was never as well known as her close friend Robert Lowell. Now, for some reason only an astrologer could explain, the attention has arrived in bulk, and I suspect that Bishop -- the great poet was an intensely private person -- would have been appalled by all of it. Three big books have descended in the past 18 months: Brett C. Millier's excellent critical biography, "Elizabeth Bishop: Life and the Memory of It"; Robert Giroux's monumental edition of Bishop's letters, "One Art," and now Gary Fountain and Peter Brazeau's "Remembering Elizabeth Bishop: An Oral Biography," in which Bishop's friends tell all they knew of her or guessed at, sparing us no ghastly detail.
A collection of interviews, strapped together by an intelligent though minimal narrative, presents problems. Such a book looks unfinished. Of course a biographer will interview everyone above ground -- 118 people are listed as contributors to this book -- but shouldn't the biographer then assess their testimony, correct errors, eliminate the contradictions and repetitions? Shouldn't he challenge anything he hears? After all, in an interview everyone sets out to make himself look good. If anyone failed to extend the helping hand Bishop so often needed, if she had any detractors, their recollections do not seem to have been solicited.
Another problem: If the biographer weaves the interviews into a continuous text, he will lose some detail -- and detail may be the only reason for taking the oral history route -- but if he doesn't, he'll have to sacrifice a lot of context. We learn, for instance, a great deal about the affection Bishop and Lowell had for each other in the 1940's (he even proposed to her, prompting us to speculate on the marriage of a violent, schizophrenic poet to a reserved, lesbian poet), but we don't learn that in 1947 Lowell's "Lord Weary's Castle" edged Bishop's "North & South" for the Pulitzer Prize -- a detail that must have been important to them both.
Peter Brazeau, the author of "Parts of a World: Wallace Stevens Remembered," began collecting interviews for this oral biography in 1984, five years after Bishop's death; he died two years later. Gary Fountain, chairman of the English department at Miss Porter's School, has done the bulk of the work, transcribing Brazeau's tapes, conducting more interviews and writing the connecting narrative. In an oral history -- one of Studs Terkel's volumes, for example -- the testimony comes in different flavors from people of widely differing backgrounds and conditions, but oral biography is different: the friends of Elizabeth Bishop are a homogeneous lot; their voices in these edited transcripts are mostly interchangeable.
Generic difficulties aside, "Remembering Elizabeth Bishop" amply succeeds in what it proposes to do: It offers an intimate view of Bishop's desperate and lonely life, as that life was observed by those who were there at the time -- and those observers are a particularly perceptive and articulate lot. Bishop was born in Worcester, Mass., in 1911, but after the death of her father and the incarceration of her mother in an asylum, she was brought up by relatives in Nova Scotia and Massachusetts. A sickly child -- her asthma afflicted her throughout her life -- she developed into a dreamy, preoccupied adolescent with an early interest in poetry. Lonely from the start, and without geographical roots, she had to grow up on her own. Most of her close friends were women, as were her companions in later years. One friend explains that she and Bishop "belonged to a generation of women who were terrified by the idea of being known as lesbians, and for Elizabeth as poet, the lesbian label would have been particularly dangerous." The poet Frank Bidart remembers her saying that she "believed in closets, closets and more closets."
CLEMENT GREENBERG, the art critic, recalls Bishop as "self-possessed. . . . so agreeable, so amiable, so right -- good company. . . . No professional jealousy, unlike some good poets." Her friend Helen Muchnic speaks of Bishop's taste as a "combination of the simple, authentic and unusual." This quality of taste provoked occasions that I'd have paid dearly to attend. Bishop liked jazz, befriended Billie Holiday, and arranged a jam session between Holiday and the harpsichord master Ralph Kirkpatrick, though neither had heard of the other before. The publisher James Laughlin remembers Bishop in Key West, inviting him and Tennessee Williams to tea in a brothel that she knew of.
Yet before she was 30 Bishop had begun drinking heavily, and acquaintances remember times when she was "totally drunk," "hitting the banisters" so she "ricocheted off the walls." In such a state she was likely to ask, to the horror of those who heard her, "Should I kill myself?" More and more Bishop depended on the strong women she lived with to save her from herself, and there seemed always to be one willing to restrain her, clean up after her, take her to the hospital. Always worried that she hadn't written enough, she died of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm in 1979.
"Her life was often out of control, but her poetry is precise," a former student says. It was "as if her poetry had to create an order missing from her life." When Bishop spoke of Vermeer's paintings -- "the objects in them are very precisely observed and rendered" -- she might have been describing her own work, which combines rigorous observation with a highly economical and disciplined line to provide verse that points to a mystery at the heart of things and conditions. In a generation of slack and confessional poets, she forgave herself and her poems nothing.

HEADLINE: The County's Lure: More for the Money

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WHAT induces companies to move from New York City to Westchester? Is it because of the city's problems? Tax reasons? Or is it simply because a company's chief executive lives in Westchester? Perhaps it is a quality-of-life decision.
Those may be contributing factors, said William V. Cuddy Jr., senior vice president and principal of Rostenberg-Doern Company, a commercial brokerage in Purchase. But the bottom line, Mr. Cuddy said, is that space in Westchester is a better buy. 
 "The rent spread in similar buildings in Manhattan and Westchester is somewhere in the neighborhood of $10 to $15 a square foot with Westchester in the low end," Mr. Cuddy said. "Currently, rents for Class A and B space in Westchester range from $19 to $24 a square foot plus electricity, and right now in New York City, rents are rising. Rates for similar space in Midtown are between $34 and $44 a square foot. We are working with a number of people in diverse industries from the city who are considering relocating their businesses to Westchester."
Which is good news for the county, Mr. Cuddy added.
Bolstered by third-quarter results showing positive absorption of office space and lower vacancy rates, the Westchester office market is positioned for a significant recovery this year, he said.
"According to our third-quarter real estate report, the vacancy rate for Westchester was 24.6, down from 26.9 at the end of 1993," Mr. Cuddy said. "With the completion of several major leases, including the Mastercard relocation from Manhattan to the former International Business Machines building in Purchase and the expected move of Ciba Corporation, the international chemical company, to 575,000 square feet in Tarrytown, from a building Ciba owns in Ardsley, the absorption, which is the net increase or decrease for occupied space could exceed a million square feet by the end of the year. It would be a dramatic rebound from last year when the county had a negative absorption of 1.25 million square feet."
Despite continuing downsizing by major corporations, lower vacancy rates were achieved in part by strong leasing activity in the county's so-called trophy buildings.
Warren L. Schwerin, president of Related Properties of Purchase and Manhattan, is the investor-builder of the five trophy buildings that make up the Center at Purchase. Four of the buildings have tenants, and the fifth is owned by Nestle.
"The Center is now 10 years old, so leases are coming up for renewal," Mr. Schwerin said. "We have renewed long-term leases with many of our tenants, including Sprint and Apple Computer, but when Mutual of New York, one of our original tenants, sold their pension division to Agon, a Dutch company, the new company that emerged, Diversified Investors, was considering moving to new headquarters and looked at a number of potential buildings."
In an effort to keep Diversified Investors from moving out of 200,000 square feet, Mr. Schwerin said, "we approached them exactly as if they were a brand-new tenant." He added: "We even supplied an architectural presentation and showed a plan for the rehabilitation of the building. Other landlords in Westchester and in Fairfield were wooing them hard. We emphasized the value of continuity, keeping them in the building that they had always been in and the advantages of being in a building that was owned and operated by the original investor-builder, who has an office on the premises."
Mr. Schwerin further observed: "I believe what also worked strongly in our favor was that in addition to the major renovations we were willing to make to the building was our ability to out-source. Out-sourcing means that we were willing to take over all the responsibility and costs of the security and the food-service facility, which had previously been the tenants' responsibility. And we also installed a health club for the use of all our major tenants."
Eventually, he said, Diversified Investors signed a 10-year lease for the 200,000 square feet of space with a 5-year option and rights for an additional 40,000 square feet.
"And as 1970 lease cycles are ending, he said, "we are receiving inquiries from a number of entrepreneurs in Manhattan who want to relocate."
For tenants looking for space outside Manhattan, the amenity packages that most campus office parks in Westchester offer are a big draw, Mr. Cuddy said.
"Suddenly, office parks have improved dramatically in response to the times," he said. "The sterile atmosphere is gone. They have become more like self-contained villages with many services available, everything from barber shops and dry-cleaning stores to health clubs. On-site food services have also improved tremendously. Upscale catering services on the premises are available for dinners and meetings in addition to supplying breakfasts and luncheons for the occupants of the park."
Also new are lunchtime seminars, lectures and newsletters, which announce park events. A supplemental bus service, run by the county, runs from the White Plains train station along Westchester Avenue, making stops at all the office parks.
In downtown White Plains, the county's central business district, the third- quarter vacancy rate was 32.4 compared with 35 at the end of last year.
About 60 percent of all the vacant space in downtown White Plains is concentrated in three large buildings -- Gateway, Westchester One and 360 Hamilton Avenue, buildings that have been adversely affected by the downsizing of I.B.M. and American Telephone & Telegraph. The largest transaction downtown was the Westchester County Appellate Court lease for 20,000 square feet of space.
Mr. Cuddy added: "The general feeling is that the office market in Westchester will continue to recover, and since there hasn't been any new construction in the county for three years, older buildings are being renovated and adapted for alternative use. And some special properties are coming on the market. The Ciba Building, for example. Ciba plans to sell its property in Ardsley next year. It has over 400,000 square feet of space with not only lab space but also unusual state-of-the-art equipment. This would be a unique opportunity for a biotech company to come into the county."
In the western half of the county, primarily the area along Route 119 in Tarrytown, absorption was more than 320,000 square feet at the end of the third quarter. The conversion of the landmark Axe Castle from offices to hotel-restaurant space removed 26,000 square feet from the inventory. Other major deals in the western half of the county include a Liberty Mutual Insurance Company lease of 19,203 square feet and Marshall Cavendish Corporation's acquisition of 31,500 square feet.
In the northern half of the county, which includes Mount Pleasant and Mount Kisco, the third-quarter figure was nearly 173,000 square feet absorbed. A major transaction was the leasing of 29,000 square feet by the Travelers and 9,000 square feet by Merrill Lynch. In the negative column was 50,000 square feet that came on the market when I.B.M. moved out of two buildings in Ossining.

HEADLINE: New Greenburgh Law On Carbon Monoxide

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
AS part of a restructuring of an already rigorous building code, the town of Greenburgh recently adopted a provision to require that new buildings, both commercial and residential, install carbon-monoxide detectors. This measure was prompted in part by the recent death of the tennis star Vitas Gerulaitis and, closer to home, the death last year of a Hartsdale resident .
"We are re-adopting a sprinkler law that has been around since 1982 because the state told us that the law was defective on technicalities," said Paul J. Feiner, Greenburgh Town Supervisor. "As we were revising a tough sprinkler law, we thought we might as well add this." 
 Detectors would be required in new construction and also recommended for any living quarters. In December, Greenburgh will begin alerting residents to the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning and the benefits of installing detectors, primarily through meetings of neighborhood groups and townwide mailings. Carbon-monoxide detectors are available at hardware stores and places like Caldor and Pergament. Prices start at about $40.
"These would prevent deaths," said Walter J. Schoonmaker, the Hartsdale Fire Chief. "Smoke detectors work; sprinklers work, and these carbon-monoxide detectors are just one more way to help people not be overcome by fumes. We have such energy-efficient homes now that everybody is sealed up."
Since the requirement in Greenburgh is more stringent than the State Building Code, the state Building Code Council in Albany, a division of the State Housing and Community Renewal Agency, must rule on the change. Few problems are expected, however, said Frederick W. Turner, the Greenburgh Town Attorney.
"Other municipalities have adopted this provision," Mr. Turner added. "If Kingston, for example, can justify it, it can be justified in Greenburgh." MERRI ROSENBERG

SPECIAL TRUST
By Robert C. McFarlane with Zofia Smardz.
Illustrated. 399 pp. New York:
Cadell & Davies. $25. 
 AS self-exculpatory memoirs go, Robert C. McFarlane's "Special Trust" is more interesting, and more convincing, than most. Mr. McFarlane was President Ronald Reagan's national security adviser from late 1983 to late 1985. He served during the first, critical years of the Mikhail S. Gorbachev regime, and he considers his work in redefining Soviet-American relations during that period his principal public achievement. But he also launched the policy initiatives that led to the Iran-contra scandal, and he is astute enough to realize that his own reputation depends above all on what he reveals of that ill-fated venture.
In July 1985, Mr. McFarlane reports, David Kimche of the Israeli Foreign Ministry called on him and proposed a scheme to assassinate the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran. Mr. McFarlane rejected that idea out of hand. But he was interested in Mr. Kimche's broader proposal that the United States begin making overtures to dissident, "moderate" groups within the Iranian regime, who might, with Western help, have a chance to seize power. Those groups would, Mr. Kimche said, arrange for the release of American hostages in Lebanon as evidence of their legitimacy and good faith. But within a few days, the "moderate" Iranians added demands for sophisticated American weapons. Mr. Reagan nevertheless approved the initiative, and Mr. McFarlane (with some misgivings and somewhat inattentively) oversaw its execution.
It was, he now concedes, a mistake. It became clear almost from the start that the effort was turning into nothing more than a swap of arms for hostages, and an unsuccessful one at that. Mr. McFarlane soon urged the President to terminate the venture, but Mr. Reagan, emotionally committed to the fate of the hostages, kept it going against his advice. The other foreign policy principals in the Administration -- Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger and Vice President George Bush -- were fully aware of the initiative from the start. None of them, Mr. McFarlane claims, communicated any strenuous objections to the President, although Mr. Shultz and Mr. Weinberger complained loudly about the effort outside Mr. Reagan's presence.
The diversion of funds from the Iranian arms sales to the Nicaraguan contras -- and the entire illegal effort to fund the contras in defiance of Congressional restrictions, the effort that became the real heart of the subsequent scandal -- was, Mr. McFarlane insists, the work of William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, and of Mr. McFarlane's own "right-hand man," Oliver North; it remained unknown to virtually everyone else. The diversions themselves did not occur until after Mr. McFarlane had left government, and he knew nothing of them until Mr. North mentioned them offhandedly to him in 1986. The larger fund-raising effort began earlier, right under Mr. McFarlane's nose, but Mr. North consistently falsified both his statements and his documents to leave Mr. McFarlane in the dark. Mr. McFarlane had suspicions, he admits, but he did not pursue them.
Mr. McFarlane offers a vivid portrait of good intentions gone awry, of zealotry run amok and of the torrent of lies and deceptions that followed exposure of the initiatives. At the time, he was hardest of all on himself, convinced that his failure to stop the plan when he had the chance was the cause of all that subsequently went wrong. Early in 1987, he attempted suicide. Later, he testified before Congress without immunity, pleaded guilty to four misdemeanors and eventually received a pardon (unasked for, he says) from President George Bush.
In hindsight, Mr. McFarlane believes he behaved unwisely but honorably. He cannot say the same about others. Mr. Shultz and Mr. Weinberger exaggerated their efforts to stop the initiative and, along with Mr. Bush, lied about how much they knew. Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, spread false rumors about Mr. McFarlane in an effort to make him a scapegoat for the scandal. Oliver North, "the man I had thought was patriotic, self-sacrificing and loyal" turned out to be "devious, self-serving" and "deceitful, mendacious and traitorous." And Ronald Reagan, for whom Mr. McFarlane obviously has real respect and affection and "who approved every single action I ever took in this matter," in the end "lacked the moral conviction and intellectual courage to stand up in our defense and in defense of his policy."
THE real tragedy of the Iran-contra affair, Mr. McFarlane believes, is that it obscured and, for a time, obstructed the larger foreign policy aims of the Reagan Administration, which he continues enthusiastically to defend. Although a bitter and largely personal feud between Mr. Shultz and Mr. Weinberger (which he describes in withering detail) all but crippled the national security system at times, there were real achievements, he feels. The great Reagan-era arms buildup, Mr. McFarlane contends, was the result of an official judgment, made early in Mr. Reagan's first term, that the Soviet Union was so weak that forcing it into a costly arms race would help hasten its demise. Subsequent events, he believes, have vindicated that decision.
The Strategic Defense Initiative, he claims, was essentially a "bargaining chip," designed to intimidate the Soviet Union into an arms control agreement; almost all its original proponents (except the President, who had a hazy, romantic commitment to the idea) realized that it was too costly and too unreliable ever to be built. Ultimately, Mr. McFarlane believes, S.D.I. produced its intended result.
Mr. McFarlane offers, in short, an account of how the United States (and the Reagan Administration) supposedly won the cold war, a version of history he has a clear stake in promoting. But his brutal honesty in describing the illegality, duplicity, jealousy and stupidity that ran through the foreign policy processes of the Reagan years greatly weakens his triumphal assessment.
 
 
 
UNVINDICATING OLIVER NORTH
 Robert C. McFarlane feels the Iran-contra affair was in essence a disagreement over separation of powers. "Ronald Reagan should have come forward and had a public argument over what the Constitution intended about the conduct of foreign policy," Mr. McFarlane, the former national security adviser, said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles, where he was promoting his book, "Special Trust." "Then we would have gotten some useful lessons out of this scandal."
The heart of the disagreement, he observed, was not the White House agenda toward Iran and Central America but its arrogant indifference to the prerogatives of Congress. "Unless Presidents and Congresses engage with mutual respect, they're going to get in trouble," he said.
Mr. McFarlane thinks that no White House subordinates should have been punished for their roles in the Iran-contra affair, not even Oliver North. This is the reason he testified sympathetically for the defense at Mr. North's criminal trial, he explained, something he now says may have helped fuel his former aide's rise to national political prominence. "People feel that North was somehow vindicated, and that is unfortunate," Mr. McFarlane said. "His record of lying is by his own testimony, there for all to see."
Although Mr. McFarlane is now a private adviser to governments in the developing world and companies seeking to do business with them, he keeps a keen eye on national security issues. He considers the threat of nuclear proliferation in totalitarian states the key worry, and he has mixed reviews for the bargain the Clinton Administration and its emissary, Jimmy Carter, forged with North Korea. "Korea will be stable, but the process of contracting out your foreign policy to individuals who don't feel constrained to operate within any policy framework is a very worrisome methodology," he said.

HEADLINE: To Dance In Veracruz

BYLINE: By ROSELLEN BROWN; Rosellen Brown is the author of "Cora Fry's Pillow Book," a volume of poetry (Farrar, Straus & Giroux).

 BODY:
IN Veracruz, everyone dances.
When I close my eyes on the city, a deep, methodical drumbeat throbs without flagging and everyone is in motion, from little boys gently guided by older girls to ancients like the decrepit woman I saw in the zocalo who put aside her tray of Chiclets and plastic doodads to dance with an equally old man in a shiny-elbowed suit jacket. Her face transformed, she moved with great spirit, hips in subtle motion, loose and comfortably graceful, her shoulders perfectly still. When she stopped to pick up her burden again and released her partner to the shaky gait in which he apparently lives his nondancing life, it was clear that "danzon," the very sober and formal dance favored by Veracruzanos, had held them upright as long as the music lasted. 
 I had heard that Veracruz was a cross between European cafe culture and a New Orleans-Havana haven of music and dance. Both and neither turned out to be quite true.
Once upon a time, Veracruz was a haven for pirates. In 1519, Hernando Cortes -- a man some might call a pirate for his own cause -- made landfall on the Mexican coast here. He gets credit for naming the city La Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz, the Rich Town of the True Cross, rather exhaustively blending his joint hungers for spiritual and material plenty. Veracruz became a thriving Gulf port, until the 1760's the only New World port allowed to trade directly with Spain: so, when gold and jewels from the Orient entered Mexico from the west coast, they exited to Europe through Veracruz, which apparently posed an irresistible invitation to those like Sir Francis Drake who lived by plunder.
For doubters, in the Baluarte de Santiago, a fortress in the center of town that is the last remnant of Veracruz's defensive wall, there is a permanent exhibit of a huge haul dredged up by an octopus fisherman 20 years ago -- exquisitely detailed gold tortoises, eagles, symbols of war and a depressing number of cigar-shaped gold bars made of melted-down jewelry by some power less interested in esthetics than in economics.
Early Veracruz got a bad press from travelers not bent on conquest or plunder. In 1843, Fanny Calderon de la Barca, the Scottish wife of the Spanish ambassador to Mexico, described the coastal city in her "Life in Mexico." "Anything more melancholy . . . and forlorn . . . cannot well be imagined . . . mountains of moving sand, formed by the violence of the north wind . . . The houses seemed blackened by fire; there is not a carriage on the streets," wrote the lady, whose hopes for festivity and glamour had to await her arrival in Mexico City, 200 miles inland. Her departure for the fertile green mountains to the west brought forth a final spasm of hyperbole: ". . . as in Dante's 'Commedia,' after leaving Purgatory, typified by Veracruz, we seemed to draw nearer to Paradise."
Fanny approached Veracruz by sea. Nowadays you drive in from the airport. The typically unbeautiful route, El Grand Route del Automotive Repair, takes you around a rather dingy traffic circle matter-of-factly overseen by a mammoth Olmec head of the sort that dominated the area in wilder times. It is an unmistakable sign of arrival.
Needless to say, the city gives a far better accounting of itself 150 years after Fanny Calderon de la Barca snubbed it, admitting even as she did so, that "those who have resided here for any length of time, even foreigners, almost invariably become attached to it; and as for those born here, they are the truest of patriots, holding up Veracruz as superior to all other parts of the world." That extraordinary zeal still holds true. A journalist who has lived in a number of other Mexican cities confided that she'd settled here because, though it might lack intellectual refinement, there is no place in Mexico like Veracruz for spirit, for joie de vivre. "Other people think we are crazy here," she insisted rather proudly, "but this is the most open city in Mexico." Politically? Morally? Socially? The answer was unclear but her loyalty was palpable.
Certainly it is the noisiest. If my memory of morning in serene and lovely Florence is a dozen Vespas furiously cranking up under the windows of my pension, in Veracruz, it is marimbas, guitars, plastic bottles filled with beans and a variety of gourds revised into rhythm instruments that keep their strict beat until 2 and 3 in the morning front of the hotel cafes that face the zocalo. It is impossible to spend time here and not think about how our reveries at home tend to be shattered by the irregular sounds of motors, leaf blowers, car alarms and the cheeping of large trucks backing up. Here, music leaps out everywhere, all the time, and incites a response: it blares from speakers, live bands send it forth from the propped-open doors of small cafes. Here, quiet is not sociable; therefore it is not much honored.
At just about any hour of the day, for example, my husband, Marv, and I enter either of the two huge, unadorned coffee houses called Gran Cafe de la Parroquia and hear not only the musicians who ply between tables shaking their little gourds for spare change, but also an unending high-pitched chorus of spoons tapping. The delightful routine here is to be served coffee in glasses into which a strolling waiter pours alternate streams of strong brew and steaming milk from big kettles -- pours from a daunting height without spilling so much as a drop -- and when it's time for a refill he answers to the sound of a spoon struck against the empty glass. The constant high-pitched tinkle is more merry than insistent; just to practice its effectiveness I succumbed to a horrific number of refills. (La Parroquia serves two specialties for breakfast that I've encountered nowhere else: gordas, great puffed pasties as fat as their name, filled with surprises like anise, and picadas, small pizzalike tortillas, their toppings held in by a raised border. They are filling and addictive.)
For another clientele entirely, there is one very pleasant bookstore-coffeehouse where a more genteel silence accompanies the cappuccino. The Atarazanas, a long, bright yellow, wood-and-tile-ceilinged building with an inviting garden, was a naval museum until its conversion a few years ago into this lovely, breezy, book-filled space.
In general, Veracruz offers few of the images we like to take home in our cameras. There are, for instance, only a small number of Indians in evidence (though some representatives of the flying men from nearby Papantla, famous for leaping upside down from poles, dance gravely in the streets in their mirrored hats). But perhaps because there are no lace-and-ribbon costumes, no rainbow-colored weavings, only one modest local crafts shop and no gilded cathedrals -- the 18th-century parish church, La Parroquia, is nothing special and several other churches were converted to warehouses during the Revolution -- the tourists for whom the party never ceases tend to be internal, not international.
Until Acapulco was connected to Mexico City by good roads to the southwest, many weekend vacationers routinely flocked east to the beaches of Veracruz; a fair number still do. South of the city, there is a fancy beach, the Mocambo, and a stretch of familiarly elegant hotels, not to mention those interchangeable tokens of commercial life, McDonald's, Sanborns et al. There is even an impressively large mall, as glitzy from a distance as anything north of the border. The sophistication of this local Zona Rosa would presumably surprise Ross Perot, whose stereotyped vision of Mexico seems more Rivera than Riviera, more peasant in rebozo than upscale diner with credit card.
Still, "upscale" is not really what this town is about. It is mainly working class, unfrenzied, casually dressed, and the Mocambo is not really for local consumption. The beach popular with residents is the Villa del Mar, paralleled by a wide drive, the malecon, not far from downtown Veracruz. Edged by a working port and its attendant international crop of sailors, it's not a particularly prepossessing stretch of golden sand, probably not worth leaving the zocalo for.
Veracruz is a lived-in city, and it comes most vibrantly alive after dark.
Walking the back streets after we'd had dinner in one of the small, family-run restaurants that always surprise with their hospitality -- the owner brought us fat pieces of orange cake, gratis, because we'd been having a neighborly conversation about the old photos on the walls -- we came upon a little square, La Plazuela de la Campana, beside the Convent of Santo Domingo. The sound of guitars drew us around the corner and into a well-lighted space, raggedly attended, with a stage where a performance of Garcia Lorca's "House of Bernarda Alba" was in progress. The play calls for a stageful of earnest young women in black, but here in the shadow of the church they looked far more at home than in the high school auditoriums and off-Broadway black boxes where I've encountered them before, passionately embracing and renouncing and declaiming. The troupe was modest -- no identifying placards announced its name --but perhaps, in this intimate town, it was assumed that anyone who cared knew who they were.
Dance, obviously, is the city's defining pleasure. We glimpsed couples of every unpromising size and age in continuous movement in the cafes. If La Bamba did not start right here, then it started near here, and Mexico's Mardi Gras is said to be a mini-Rio (only safer). So, when we were advised to "Come see the dancing on Saturday night in the zocalo," we obediently turned up, expecting a spectator sport. There is a lot of local "folkloric" performance in Veracruz -- young men and women in superb and colorful costumes flawlessly executing their intricate Spanish-influenced steps, stamping down hard and flaunting the most captivating faces and figures imaginable, and that was what we assumed we'd see.
Oddly, though, the dancing space, one broad swathe of sidewalk, was ringed by the kind of white plastic garden chairs ubiquitous in American backyards. They filled up quickly, the spectators waiting patiently, chatting. We bought some pudding from a vendor and settled in while half of Veracruz showed up (later we learned that the other half was assembling across town in the Parque Zamora). Some people were dressed up for going out, some looked like they'd just come from work -- soon enough it became clear that they were there to provide their own entertainment.
"Danzon," which evolved in Veracruz with the help of its numerous Cuban immigrants, is called "dancing on a brick." There is only the most subtle abandon in it; those who subscribe to the idea that partial undress is more erotic than total nudity will find it far more mesmerizing than any free spontaneous dance could be. Imagine a box step of the kind teenagers used to learn. This, however, is far more beguiling, a sort of elaborated rumba executed with formal dignity, a controlled flirtatiousness and an attentiveness -- eyes fixed unflinchingly on eyes -- that amounts to a built-in seductiveness. The dancers, in straw hats and baseball caps, in high heels and walking shoes, conduct themselves with regal bearing, their postures controlled if not exactly rigid (no shoulder movement allowed), and at a given point, though there is no inflection in the music that taught us to hear it coming, everyone breaks out for a minute -- they swing wide away from each other, solitary, then fold back together with a feeling of resolution, of safe return. And this they repeat with a nearly awesome patience.
Soon there are hundreds of people moving almost identically. Down at one end of the zocalo cluster half a dozen teen-age girls in matching white dresses with striped pastel sashes, and boys in white shirts, all of them wearing white satin team jackets that celebrate "Three Generations of Danzon in Veracruz" -- a club devoted to this single dance! The young partners change with a dispassion that must be club discipline, some form of democratic passing around of capable but interchangeable bodies. The little boys of 7 or 8 who dance with the older girls, right arms extended at an exactly dictated height, are learning a kind of courtliness far too constrained and gentlemanly for American kids of the same generation to imagine, let alone enjoy.
The whole surprising scene is only a reminder that culture is made of many subtle parts. Like this formal civility, which is very Latin -- nothing like the stodgy "ballroom dancing" I've seen in, say, St. Petersburg or Warsaw, which seems moored in the 40's -- some ideals are maintained against tides that otherwise shift and slip. The television sets blaring in shop windows proffer the usual American fare, or its local equivalent, untouched by anything that could remotely be called civility, old- or new-fashioned. Yet here we stand happily under the trees in the lee of the heavy beat and watch tradition stake its claims. The dance starts early and ends late: the children rehearse unchanging parts while their grandparents whirl past smiling, faces avid, like young lovers, focused magnetically on each other's eyes.
The music plays on, even on Sunday night. Under the portico of our hotel, we sit at a cafe watching two sailors trying to talk to some local women a little too young for courting. The women, who were walking by with a seductive torpor, will not sit down but they giggle and shrug until finally, discouraged by language, one of the sailors begins to sing along with the marimba-guitar-and-gourd-that-sounds-like-it-has-nails-in-it. Ah, then, the women seem to say, looking at each other quickly. Ah, then, he speaks our language. They pull their chairs out, one of them mouthing the words of the song, and sit.
 
TOWN AND BEACH
 Veracruz has accommodations in all price ranges. The three hotels listed below provide a sampler of choice locations -- downtown, harbor or beachfront. All are air-conditioned. The telephone country code for Mexico is 52.
 HOTEL VERACRUZ, at the corner of Avenida Independencia and Miguel Lerdo (telephone: 29-31-22-33; fax: 29-31-51-34), is in the heart of downtown Veracruz, just off the Plaza de Armas, or zocalo. Completely remodeled in 1988, the six-story hotel has an Art Deco lobby with marble floors and a small fountain. Its 104 rooms all come with showers and are simply furnished with dark mahogany pieces; each room has a wooden balcony that overlooks downtown. The music from the zocalo -- where live bands perform for diners in the sidewalk cafes ringing the square -- is less audible on the higher floors. Double rooms are about $85; one-bedroom suites are about $120. The hotel has a small rooftop swimming pool. At the 1940 restaurant, a dinner for two, which might include grilled Huachinango snapper served with a salsa Veracruzana of garlic, hot peppers and onions, costs about $50, with wine.
 HOTEL EMPORIO, 210 Insurgentes Veracruzanos (29-32-34-10; fax: 29-31-22-61), is set on the Malecon, the promenade that runs along the harbor. The hotel, which first opened in 1955, has a lobby bar, gym, three swimming pools and glass elevators. Its 202 rooms, which have color television sets and wall-to-wall carpeting, are painted in pastel colors and furnished in wicker. All of the rooms have bathtubs; more than 50 of them are equipped with Jacuzzis. Double rooms are about $95; master suites (with two bedrooms) are about $170. The specialty at DEL FARO restaurant, which overlooks the sea, is mariscada, a mixed-seafood dish of octopus, breaded shrimp and fresh fish. A dinner for two, with wine, costs about $60.
 HOTEL MOCAMBO, 4000 Calzada Ruiz Cortines, in Mocambo (29-22-02-11; fax: 29-22-02-12), is on the coast about six miles south of Veracruz. Built in 1932, the Mocambo is a sprawling beachfront complex of gardens, Moorish-style arches and whitewashed buildings. The hotel has indoor and outdoor swimming pools, game room, tennis courts, gym, sauna and steam bath. All of the 125 rooms, which come with color television sets, carved wooden furniture and bathrooms done in colorful tile from the city of Puebla, have ocean views. Double rooms are about $105; suites are about $120. A dinner for two at LA FRAGATA restaurant, which might include corn-and-shrimp chowder and grilled sea bass stuffed with shrimp and octopus, costs about $55, with wine.
 
A QUARTET OF EXCURSIONS
 There are a number of intriguing spots near Veracruz that merit a side trip. LA ANTIGUA, 14 miles to the north, is a somnolent river village where the ruins of Cortes's (alleged) headquarters stand strangled by petrified vines. Twenty-four miles to the north is ZEMPOALA, which contains the remains of an archeologically unique Totonac city. And in the picturesque town of TLACOTALPAN, some 70 miles to the southeast, time seems to have stopped around 1900.
 About two hours (62 miles) inland is JALAPA, the capital of the state of Veracruz. (Its inhabitants are called -- it never occurred to me -- Jalapenos.) The University of Veracruz makes Jalapa a city with a different feeling from Veracruz. Its Cafe Parroquia (unrelated to Veracruz's, perhaps every parish has its own) has a rather intellectual-looking clientele and a bulletin board crammed with announcements of concerts, theatrical events and poetry readings. A block or so away is the Government Palace, an imposing building of startling elegance. There is also an exciting anthropology museum (Museo de Antropologia de Jalapa), built into a hillside by local workers, from a design by the firm of Edward Durrell Stone -- Jalapa is as hilly as Veracruz is flat. The museum has an extremely rich collection of Olmec, Huastec and other local artifacts and statuary shown in spaces large enough to honor their mammoth size. Its explanatory wall texts are untranslated, but the collection is so imposing that it hardly depends upon words to make its strength felt. ROSELLEN BROWN

WATCH WITH ME
And Six Other Stories of the Yet-Remembered Ptolemy Proudfoot and His Wife, Miss Minnie, Nee Quinch.
By Wendell Berry.
210 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. $21. 
THE talky subtitle of "Watch With Me," Wendell Berry's new collection of stories, might suggest that it belongs to the babbling-rube school of rural fiction. But it does not. His characters, who live near Port William, Ky., the fictional community where all eight of Mr. Berry's novels and books of stories have been set, speak straightforwardly or not at all. Even Ptolemy (Tol) Proudfoot, who is considered by his neighbors to be unusually sociable, and who late in life is known as something of a storyteller, talks with the efficiency of a man who makes a good living off a small farm.
Mr. Berry, who is also a distinguished essayist and an accomplished poet, works a Kentucky farm, like Tol Proudfoot. He writes as Tol speaks, with a good husbandman's care and economy. Although his stories are filled with gentle humor, he never disrupts the natural syntax of his sentences for the cheap comic effects of so much contemporary rural fiction. He views his characters with sympathy and with an honest curiosity that makes it unnecessary to exaggerate their characteristics -- or to turn them into grotesques -- in order to arouse his own interest in them, or the reader's.
In this collection Mr. Berry's narrator recounts episodes from Tol's life, beginning with his courtship of Miss Minnie Quinch, the local schoolteacher, in 1908 ("A Consent"), and ending, two years before Tol's death, at a church picnic in 1941 ("Turn Back the Bed"). During the picnic Tol relates an antic story of a chamber pot overturned during a large family gathering in his youth. The Proudfoots, the narrator tells us in another story, had been "a big family of big people" who "liked to work together and to be together." But "the old had died and the young had gone," until Tol was the only one left. Tol is the last of the Proudfoots, for he and Miss Minnie have had no children.
Tol does not dwell on his solitude, perhaps because he and Miss Minnie are such a good match. She is as small and neat as he is big and slovenly (about his dress, but not his farm). They sit close, nudging each other affectionately, when they ride together in their buggy, and later in their car. The warmth of their marriage radiates out into the community, which delights in their unlikely love.
"The Solemn Boy" takes place in the Depression year of 1934. A man and his young son, "poorly dressed for the weather," appear on Tol's farm. Tol can see that they are hungry as well as cold, and he begins to coax the proud father to accept his and Miss Minnie's hospitality. "Be nice to get that boy up beside the stove where he can get warm," Tol says. "And a bean or two and a hot biscuit in his belly wouldn't hurt him either, I don't expect."
When the father accepts, Tol tells them to go around back and find Miss Minnie in the kitchen. "She'll be glad to see you," he promises the strangers. As the two wanderers eat unrelentingly in the warm kitchen, Tol and Miss Minnie's interest in the boy changes from their reliable good will toward others into a very particular sadness about their own childlessness. It is typical of Mr. Berry that this quiet, poignant story turns on a pratfall of Tol's, which succeeds in its intention of separating the boy, if only for a moment, from his solemnity.
The long title story reminds me of one of my favorite short stories, Eudora Welty's wonder-filled "Wide Net," in which a decidedly miscellaneous party of neighbors helps a young husband drag a river, looking for his wife, who has threatened to drown herself. "Watch With Me" also begins with a neighbor in trouble. Thacker Hample, known for having spells, walks past Tol's shed one day, picks up a loaded shotgun leaning against it and walks away, threatening to kill himself.
Tol and a growing group of men begin to trail him at a distance, hoping to prevent him from hurting himself or anyone else. They follow him across the countryside for a day and a night, without rancor in spite of their hunger and weariness.
Here is how the narrator describes Thacker's dementia: "His mind, which contained the lighted countryside of Katy's Branch and Cotman's Ridge, had a leak in it somewhere, some little hole through which now and again would pour the whole darkness of the darkest night -- so that instead of walking in the country he knew and among his kinfolks and neighbors, he would be afoot in a limitless and undivided universe, completely dark, inhabited only by himself." Of course Thacker isn't really alone, and that is what turns this lovely definition of insanity into a vision of what it means to be truly sane.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
President Clinton is getting a lot of free advice about how to deal with Tuesday's election disaster. Most of it is telling him to abandon his left-wing agenda and rediscover the inner moderate who propelled him to victory in 1992. Bipartisan accommodation should be his goal, it is said. This isn't completely wrong, but there are three problems with it.
First, the notion that Mr. Clinton ran as a moderate "new Democrat" and then has governed as some kind of McGovernite left-winger is mostly the product of Republican agitprop and lazy journalists' shorthand. The most familiar items in the indictment -- his top-bracket tax increase, his proposal to overhaul the health care system, homosexuals in the military -- were all things he clearly promised in the campaign. 
 The tax increase affected a tiny fraction of the population; 10 times as many have enjoyed a tax cut, through expansion of the earned income tax credit. The health care autopsy will go on forever, but Mr. Clinton's original plan, whatever its flaws, was not the standard left-wing proposal for a Canadian-style Government takeover. And Mr. Clinton (not to his credit) tried mightily to fudge and postpone and compromise the gay-troops issue; it was the opposition that mischievously made it Issue One of the new administration.
Meanwhile, Federal spending takes a smaller share of gross domestic product under Bill Clinton than it did under either Ronald Reagan or George Bush. Even leaving aside the military, the number of Federal employees went up under Presidents Reagan and Bush, and has gone down under President Clinton. But you can argue all this until you're blue in the face (I know: I do it for a living), and it doesn't sink in.
A second problem with the moderate, accommodationist strategy is that it wouldn't really give voters much reason to vote for Mr. Clinton in 1996. It would leave Republicans in charge of the agenda and leave Mr. Clinton to be perceived as a whiny supplicant, not a strong leader. Republicans will quite reasonably ask the voters, "If you like the last two years better than Bill Clinton's first two, why not finish the cleanup job?" Even if the Democratic President and the Republican Congress work well together, Mr. Clinton will be reduced to building his re-election campaign around the boring theme that divided government is best. And besides being boring, it contradicts what he said last time.
A third problem with a govern-from-the-center strategy is that the "center" these days is mostly a land of alchemy, where it is easy to campaign but hard to govern.
It is a place where taxes can be cut and budgets balanced without any impositions on treasured government benefits of the middle class. It is a place where health care can be extended to the uninsured without raising anyone's bill, and prices can be brought under control without curtailing anyone's freedom of choice.
On foreign policy, it is a place where America can stand tall as the world's leader, and strut as the promoter of democracy and human rights, but American blood and treasure need never be spent in any particular situation.
The politics of the free lunch, which Mr. Reagan introduced into fiscal policy in 1980, now dominate in every sphere. Being a "centrist" means mostly taking the pleasant stuff from both sides of the traditional debate and leaving out the unpleasant stuff. Both parties play this game. Mr. Clinton played it well enough to get elected in 1992. But surely one lesson of the 1994 election results is that Republicans -- who invented it -- will always play it better. The only hope for the Democrats is to wean the voters from the free lunch and force them to make an honest choice about what they want their Government to do and how they propose to pay for it.
So yes, President Clinton should join in at least some of the Republicans' agenda. But less in the spirit of accommodation than in the spirit of challenge -- calling their bluff, holding their feet to the fire. This is, among other advantages, a way to appear both feistily "Trumanesque" and becomingly "moderate" at the same time. Republicans have indeed managed to occupy the center of American politics. But the goal should be to kick them out, not just to join them there.
The G.O.P.'s "Contract With America," with its impossible combination of tax cuts and spending increases and balanced-budget promises, offers the perfect vehicle for such a challenge. The promise of a balanced budget (by the year 2002) alone will require something like a trillion dollars of spending cuts, even before the document's other goodies are paid for. During the campaign, the Republicans swore they could achieve this without reducing Social Security or Medicare benefits.
It can't be done, of course. That's why Mr. Clinton should give them every opportunity to try. He shouldn't "cooperate." His line should be: After you, Alphonse. Ronald Reagan's mantra -- repeated thousands of times by Republican politicians -- was that Government spending is not the President's responsibility, because under the Constitution "Congress appropriates every dime."
Fine, Mr. Clinton should say. Appropriate away. But give me that line-item veto you're always carrying on about, in case I notice some wasteful spending around Marietta, Ga. (home of the new House Speaker).
To keep up the pressure, the President should endorse the balanced budget amendment. The year 2002 will be more than two decades after the Reagan mega-deficits began, and 12 years after the much-maligned Bush 1990 budget deal started us back toward fiscal sanity. Although there is no real reason the budget needs to be balanced in any particular year, it was never anyone's idea of Keynesianism that the Government should spend more than it takes in every year, indefinitely.
True, it is a pity to clutter up the Constitution. But an acknowledgment by the majority that it is unable to restrain itself through normal democratic procedures is arguably just the sort of thing that does belong there.
Mr. Clinton should also endorse term limits, or at least say he has no objection to them. Term limits, like the balanced budget amendment, are a procedural gimmick addressed to a substantive problem and intended to appeal to the free-lunch psychology: a magic cure-all. But they won't do any great harm. It's not worth an ounce of the Democrats' dwindling political capital to stand in the way of this gimmick -- especially now that it would mainly affect Republicans.
You can debate endlessly whether term limits will produce a better or worse quality of legislator. But even from the high-minded poli-sci point of view -- as well as the narrowly partisan Democratic one -- that debate is now less important than getting this false panacea off the table. And the only way to do that, apparently, is to try it out.
Not everything in the Republican Contract is beneficial or meaningless. But after outflanking the opposition on one or two fronts, and by choosing his battles carefully, Mr. Clinton could score some mighty victories. Do the Republicans, for example, really want to push a big new tax cut for the rich by expanding the capital gains tax break? I hope so. And if they try to tie it to a broader tax cut for the middle class, that would be a perfect occasion for Clinton to demand the line-item veto they promised in their Contract.
The strategy I'm advocating here might be called "confrontational accommodationism" or "in-your-face moderation." It might not work. But does anybody have a better idea?

HEADLINE: It's Not the Only Alien Invader

BYLINE: By Alan Burdick; Alan Burdick is an editor of this magazine.

 BODY:
THREE MORNINGS A WEEK, DANIELLE KITAOKA rises at 3 A.M. and drives the 20 minutes from her home in Kaneohe, on the island of Oahu, to Honolulu International Airport, where she works as an inspector for the Hawaii Department of Agriculture. She makes a few calls from her office, then swings by the department's dog kennel near the airport to pick up an eager beagle named Columbo. Her main task for the day begins promptly at 6 with the arrival from Guam of Continental Flight 934.
"I'm on the shift because the other inspector started to burn out," Kitaoka said recently as she stood on the Tarmac at the appointed hour, watching the jetliner pull up to its gate. A small, freckle-faced woman in her late 20's, Kitaoka did not sound pleased at her assignment. "I'm not a morning person," she muttered. 
 Kitaoka owes her job to an unsettling discovery. At 7:25 A.M. on Sept. 3, 1991, workers at Honolulu International found a three-foot brown tree snake, dead with its head crushed, on one of the runways. At noon that same day, a second brown tree snake was found stunned but alive under a cargo plane that had just landed at Hickam Air Force Base, 10 minutes south of Honolulu International. The Hawaiian Islands are one of the few tropical locales with no indigenous snakes -- no indigenous reptiles of any kind, for that matter, nor any amphibians or mammals except a seal and a fruit-eating bat. Both of the brown tree snakes discovered that day three years ago had traveled from the same place: the island of Guam, 2,500 miles to the west.
The specimens of Boiga irregularis, as the bird-eating brown tree snake is known to zoologists, had long been preceded here by reports of the snake's notoriety. Guam, wholly free of brown tree snakes a half-century ago, now hosts perhaps a million of them. Nine of Guam's 11 native species of forest birds have subsequently disappeared; the Guam rail, a flightless bird found nowhere else, reigns only from behind the safety of an electrified fence in a rearing compound near the Guam airport. Hawaii's own population of flightless birds was wiped out years ago: clubbed to death or eaten by rats -- or by the mongooses introduced last century in a failed attempt to eradicate the rats. The state's remaining birds include 40 percent of those on the United States' endangered species list. All are unprepared, evolutionarily speaking, for Boiga irregularis.
Nor are Hawaii's human residents likely to relish an encounter. Hospitals on Guam have treated more than 200 brown tree snake victims, many of them infants and toddlers bitten while they slept. (The snake's venom, relatively mild to an adult, can cause severe pain and swelling in children.) Boiga irregularis also displays an irrepressible urge to climb: onto power lines -- causing frequent, costly and dispiriting outages on Guam -- and now, apparently, into the wheel wells of outbound airplanes.
At the Honolulu airport, four brown tree snakes had been found in the eight years prior to 1991, but two in one day set alarm bells ringing. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service had already assembled a loose federation of volunteers known as the Snake Watch Alert Team -- SWAT -- to report any sightings of Boiga irregularis. In July 1992, the State Agriculture Department, with a $100,000 Federal grant, acquired three snake-sniffing dogs, trained Kitaoka and four other inspectors to handle them and sent them to the gate to intercept the invader.
As earplugged men on cargo carts whisked away the contents of Flight 934, Kitaoka walked under the nose of the jet, a flashlight in her right hand. "Too high for the dogs," she explained, pointing up at the front wheel well. The top of the tires reached her chest; the well that held them was another five feet overhead. This left Columbo panting in the departmental van parked nearby. (Later he'd be driven over to the loading dock for a thorough sniff of the place.)
Maybe the batteries were low or maybe the wheel cavity extended too far upward -- whatever the reason, Kitaoka couldn't see much beyond a murky tangle of hydraulics. She continued the search for several minutes, then repeated the ritual at the wheel well under each wing. In 12 months of looking, she has yet to encounter a brown tree snake. No member of the SWAT team has seen one yet, either.
"I don't really want to find one," Kitaoka said.
I asked her what she'd do if she did.
"Scream."
 MUCH OF WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE natural comings and goings on Hawaii can be found on display or on file at the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, a 12-acre campus of limestone exhibit halls and research offices in the pleated foothills north of Honolulu. I stopped by the museum one afternoon to visit with Francis Howarth, an entomologist on staff there and one of several scientists on Oahu fearfully awaiting some sign of the brown tree snake.
"I've advocated placing a rim of caged chicks around the airport to monitor its arrival," Howarth told me as we sat across from each other at an oak table in the museum's library. He spoke through a dense white beard, which merged into a shock of silver hair atop his head. Burly forearms, laced with scratches earned in search of this endangered damselfly or that blind, cave-dwelling cricket, rested on the table top.
"We're fouling our nest at several levels," he continued, "and I think the most pervasive problem is alien species." Now as never before, he explained, exotic plants and creatures are traversing the world, borne on the swelling tide of human traffic to places where nature never intended them to be. "The introduction of alien species has gone up manyfold because of the ease of getting from one place to another," he said. "The situation is getting much, much worse."
His concern is widely shared among ecologists today. African killer bees have reached California; colonies of South American fire ants have settled in Texas. August brought news that Polygonum perfoliatum, a fast-growing vine from Asia, is quickly supplanting kudzu as the strangler of the South; it apparently arrived as seeds in the root balls of imported rhododendrons.
The most troublesome invader to have reached the United States in recent years is the zebra mussel. Native to the Caspian Sea, the striped mussel entered the St. Lawrence Seaway in the mid 1980's in ballast water released by a transoceanic cargo ship. From there it spread rapidly through the Great Lakes, clogging reservoir intake pipes, sinking buoys and slurping up the planktonic life that local fish depend upon for nourishment. In 1990, Congress passed the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act -- a bramble of task forces and requests for funds -- to remedy the situation. Oblivious, larvae of the mussel last summer rode the flooded Mississippi by the billions, extending their grip as far south as New Orleans.
"Alien species are permanent," Howarth said, clasping his hands. "There's no putting the mongoose back in the cage."
The proliferation of exotic species has spawned its own field of biological inquiry -- "invasion theory" -- and Howarth is a leading investigator. And for better or worse, the Hawaiian archipelago is an ideal laboratory for someone with his interests. The dioramas and taxidermed contents of the Bishop Museum attest to Hawaii's status as an ecological treasure: more than 90 percent of the species found here are utterly unique on earth. Yet according to a 1992 report issued by the Nature Conservancy of Hawaii and the Natural Resources Defense Council, this ecological Eden is beseiged by a "silent invasion of pest species" -- not illegal immigrants or "emerging viruses" but flora and fauna. On average, five new plants and 20 species of insect, plus the occasional pathogen and predator, are introduced to Hawaii each year, a phenomenon that has led the Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson to pronounce Hawaii "the invasion capital of the world."
I'd caught sight of a few infiltrators before I'd met with Howarth, when I'd dropped by the Hawaii Department of Agriculture's headquarters in downtown Honolulu. The department quarantines or bars entry to several hundred plants and creatures deemed agriculturally or ecologically perilous to the state. Consequently, Kitaoka and her colleagues devote most days to spot-checking the millions of baggage-laden visitors and the many more parcels, express mail packages and shipments of flowers and rutabagas and oysters that pass through Honolulu each year. Two weeks earlier, Columbo, the beagle, had caught an odd scent from an unlabeled box at the Federal Express office. Inside, wrapped in newspaper, were a dozen Tokay geckos being smuggled in as pets.
I found the geckos, bleached and embalmed in a jar of formaldehyde, on display in the lobby of the headquarters. Curled in an adjacent jar, looking more pallid than brown, were the tree snakes found in 1991. A nearby storeroom, filled with glass tanks and plastic cages, held more recent captures: electric eels, snapping turtles, iguanas, chameleons, scorpions, hamsters -- seized from suitcases and shoeboxes and Tupperware dishes. Imported illegally as pets, creatures like these are often set free on Hawaii when their owners tire of them. In the last decade, some 20 species of freshwater fish, including piranha, have taken up residence in Hawaiian streams in this manner.
Most of the concern about invading plants and creatures has focused on their economic impact. In September 1993, in a hefty report titled "Harmful Non-Indigenous Species in the United States," the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment estimated that between 1906 and 1991 the 79 most harmful exotic species to enter the United States -- among them the gypsy moth and the Mediterranean fruit fly -- cost the nation $97 billion in crop damage and pest-control efforts. The agriculture industry in Hawaii loses millions of dollars each year to alien pests like the sugar-cane aphid, which was accidentally imported a few years ago in a shipment of golf course sod.
But something less easily quantified -- though ultimately more crucial -- is at stake, as Howarth sees it. With plants and animals moving more readily from place to place, an increasing number of native species -- residents of the planet's ecological backwaters, unable to compete with zoology's rising cosmopolitan class -- are being pushed out of existence. Howarth suspects that "a lot, if not the majority, of extinctions from habitat destruction is from alien species introductions."
It is a new era, wherein the greatest threat to biological diversity may no longer be bulldozers or pesticides but, in a sense, nature itself: carried in the valises of businessmen, hidden in the orchids sent on Mother's Day, lurking in the landing gear of an airliner.
THE AIRPORT SHUTTLE DRIVER IN Honolulu laughed when I told him I was headed for Guam. "Watch out for snakes," he said.
An overnight flight across the dateline from Hawaii brings the visitor to the United States territory of Guam: 9 miles wide, 30 miles long and one of the world's more unusual cultural cauldrons. The northern end of the island, a jungly limestone plateau, is owned largely by the United States military, which wrested Guam from the Japanese in 1944. Most native Guamanians inhabit the lush volcanic hills and small, palm-fringed towns of the island's southern end. The midsection of Guam is common ground to both populations: strip malls, fast-food joints and traffic jams, although it is also home to a burgeoning resort industry, much of it Japanese-owned.
The first brown tree snake arrived on the island sometime in the late 1940's. Most biologists believe it came from one of the Admiralty Islands, near New Guinea, coiled in the dashboard of a jeep or in some other salvaged bit of wartime junk. Prior to that fateful arrival, the only snake on the island had been Rhamphotyphlops braminus, a blind and wriggling creature closer in size and spirit to a worm. Hence the early reports of the brown tree snake treated its arrival with benign curiosity. "Because they eat small pests and are not dangerous to man," The Guam Daily News reported in October 1965, alongside a photo of a seven-foot snake killed at the United Seamen's Service Center, "they may be considered beneficial to the island." Several equally large specimens were remarked upon in the local press in ensuing years, including one that a Mrs. Edith Smith found slipping across her neck at 4 o'clock one morning in June 1966.
Tales of the snake's exploits have since reached hysterical proportions. There is the snake that crawled in through the sink; the snake that materialized in the toilet while a dinner party hostess sat (briefly) on it; the snake that jumped from an automobile air-conditioning vent and sent the driver into a near-fatal swerve. According to a story published in The Wall Street Journal in 1991, the snakes "hang from trees like fat, brown strands of cooked spaghetti." But I didn't see that. A search of my hotel grounds that first morning revealed no snakes. None lurked in the grass island of the Taco Bell parking lot down the road. The closest I came was a local man who said he'd once found a snake burrowing into the nose of his pet goat, which subsequently died. "And you know, the color isn't brown," he added excitedly. "It's blue!"
I was baffled until I spoke one afternoon with Earl Campbell, Guam's resident herpetologist. An athletic but graying doctoral student from Ohio State University, Campbell conducts several research projects devoted to deciphering the habits of the brown tree snake. (Funds and supervision are provided by the National Biological Survey, a division of the Department of the Interior.) We met near Ritidian Point, the northernmost tip of Guam, in a thick and rather scruffy swath of forest where Campbell conducts his fieldwork. Right off, I recounted my futile search for Boiga irregularis.
"Many of my friends have lived on Guam for years and never seen snakes," Campbell reassured me. "The snakes are extremely averse to light. During the day they take cover in places where people aren't likely to encounter them."
After we'd chatted for a while, he suggested that if I wanted to see a snake -- or improve my odds of seeing one -- I come back the following evening. I took him up on his offer, returning the next night to find Campbell, dressed in a T-shirt, shorts and sandals, putting on a miner's helmet. He flicked on his headlamp and led me down a narrow path shrouded in foliage. Vines dangled from overhead.
"Looking for a snake in the forest is sort of like being in a demented 'Where's Waldo?' book," Campbell said, scanning the gnarled branches. Although the brown tree snake has been known to grow as long as 10 feet, most are no more than a yard long and thin as a pinky. Add to this the fact that it is a master climber, strong enough to stand virtually upright on its prehensile tail, and what you have is a supremely surreptitious creature. It will consume anything that smells of blood, from dog food and soiled tampons to semicooked spareribs and raw hamburger -- even the foam plate that the hamburger comes on. With its flexible jaw, the snake can devour creatures more than half its own weight, a category that has come to include live poultry and at least one Labrador retreiver puppy.
"It's incredible how well the brown tree snake does on Guam," Campbell marveled as we crept first down one path, then another, then another. "My average here is one an hour." When I sounded unimpressed, Campbell noted that this patch of jungle contained the highest density of brown tree snakes -- of any kind of snake, for that matter -- anywhere in the world. "In the Amazon," he said, "where there are maybe a dozen species of snake, people search for 12 hours to find one snake at night."
By 10 o'clock, the heat of the day had dissolved and the humidity began to condense around us. Spider webs choked the trail and a symphony of katydids chirred from everywhere and nowhere at once. Yet I soon realized that the aura had been even more sepulchral when I'd visited on the previous afternoon, in daylight: there had been no sound but for passing wasps and the drone of an overhead plane. It struck me that, even after several days on the island, I could count on one hand the number of birds I'd seen: one turtledove -- a species that immigrated from the Philippines several years ago -- and a few bedraggled European sparrows that stuck close by the hotel. The silence I'd been hearing was the absence of birdsong.
The effect was unsettling: a creature apparent only by the absence of any life surrounding it. No wonder Hawaiians are concerned, I thought. It was only 11 years ago, more than three decades after the snake immigrated to Guam, that ecologists were able to rule out pesticides and habitat destruction as the cause of their island's silent spring. By the time Hawaiians know for certain whether the brown tree snake is among them, the damage will be done.
MY BEST VIEW OF A BROWN TREE SNAKE CAME the following afternoon near the Guam International Airport. I had joined Thomas Hall, a stocky, upbeat fellow who runs the Animal Damage Control division of the United States Department of Agriculture on Guam. In his case, "damage control" means making sure the brown tree snake does not leave the island. It is a daunting task. Along with the busy commercial airport, Guam is home to a Navy air base, a commercial and a naval shipping port and an Air Force base. All require inspection by Hall or members of his crew, which includes 13 employees and two Jack Russell terriers.
"Detector dogs have caught several snakes," Hall told me as we circled the commercial and naval runways, which lie alongside each other in the center of Guam, in his red Isuzu Trooper. "Once, these pallets of bombs were being loaded up to go to San Diego through Hawaii and the dogs pulled a snake right out of the middle of the pallet. There's no way anyone would have seen it. The same thing with cars. We had some being loaded one morning down at Navy, going to Hawaii. The dogs pulled a snake out of the power steering unit. We caught one just the other day near an airplane. She had eight eggs in her."
We drove past hangars, cargo docks and boxy military apartments. Hall parked near a dense thicket -- beloved by brown tree snakes, he said -- that would soon be cleared away.
"Right now, our goal is to make the ports snake-free," he said, wading into the brush. His current strategy is to cast a wide net of snake traps around the ports and to check them regularly. Hall lifted a branch to reveal one of the specially designed traps, which looked like two wire-mesh wastebaskets attached at their rims. The bait was a live white mouse, safely ensconced in a tiny wire cabin with a week's worth of diced potato. Federally supported researchers in Colorado and Oregon are busily experimenting with various chemical cues and sexual pheremones in the hopes of one day replacing the mouse with a synthetic, and less costly, lure. Any permanent solution -- there is a Federally financed plot taking shape to infect the snake with the serpentine equivalent of pneumonia, for example -- is still years from fruition.
In the meantime, it is up to Hall to keep Hawaii and other places safe from brown tree snakes. "It'll be a long time before every snake is stopped from going off island," he said as we forged through the brush. But even one snake is enough. Boiga irregularis can survive for months on no food and little water, and females can produce fertile eggs for up to seven years after mating. Already the island of Saipan, 150 miles to the north, reports some six snake sightings a year, indicating a firmly entrenched population.
Hall thrashed onward, checking trap after trap -- and coming up empty. Finally, eager to demonstrate his effectiveness, Hall led me to a clearing under a large tree. A trunk-size wire cage sat on the ground. Inside, in a writhing tangle, were at least a dozen snakes. "We make sure we have some on hand for research," Hall explained.
A large one lunged at us, mouth agape, as we approached the cage, then struggled to free its fangs from the mesh. Hall lifted the lid and plucked it out with a pair of long metal tongs. He let it dangle by its neck for a moment, six feet of pure muscle coiling and uncoiling in midair. Its skin was neither brown nor blue, I noticed, but a murky green, like grass in Manhattan; its underside was yellow. Then Hall handed the snake to me. At his instruction, I placed my thumb on a bony ridge at the base of the skull and, pressing down gently, clamped the jaw safely shut against my forefinger. The rest of the snake immediately began to wreathe itself around my forearm and neck, squeezing with a gentle, almost clinical indifference, like the blood pressure gauge in a doctor's office. As the tip of the snake's tail probed my right ear, I lifted its pebbly head for a closer look -- hoping to catch a glimmer of intent. But its eyes were tiny yellow beads, slit vertically like a cat's and far more impenetrable.
Late on my last night on Guam, I looked out my hotel window and beheld a more sinister manifestation of Boiga irregularis: utter darkness. No street lamps, no porch lights, no glaring strip malls, only a few pairs of headlights streaming down Guam's blackened main boulevard. According to a television news report the following morning, two brown tree snakes had crawled onto the power lines at the south end of Guam, cutting electricity to the entire island. It was the latest of the roughly 1,200 outages snakes have caused since 1978.
On hearing the news, I hurried over to the Guam Power Authority's headquarters, a squat building along congested Marine Drive. The press officer agreed to show me the culprits. She returned from her office with a pizza box, which she flipped open. There they were: two snakes, each roughly three feet long. The true color of their skin was now virtually impossible to discern, since it had turned mostly black from the high voltage and in some places was flayed off altogether.
KILAUEA CRATER, A STRAIGHT-WALLED basin nearly 3 miles wide and 500 feet deep, is situated several thousand feet up the eastern flank of Mauna Loa, on the island of Hawaii. Sulfurous clouds pipe from the crater floor, a vast and rumpled plain of black lava crust. Directly below this surface lies the engine of the Hawaiian archipelago. Molten earth, issuing from a vent in the sea bed miles down, pushes the Big Island an inch higher each year. And each year the island drifts a little farther from its fuse -- carried west on the Pacific tectonic plate until one day, eons of erosion from now, it and Maui, Molokai, Oahu and the older members of the chain will subside beneath the waves, even as new islands blossom in their place.
The wondrous products of this brief geological moment can be found in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which unfolds for several miles around Kilauea. The rain forests, woodlands and lava flows here are home to the most extensive remnants of the archipelago's native flora and fauna, including the red, slender-billed i'iwi, one of the 47 species of honeycreeper that evolved from a mainland finch blown to the islands eons ago, and a colorful array of lobeliads, whose long-throated blossoms can be pollinated only by native birds. Also in residence are hundreds of biological aliens. A few, like the Polynesian rat, arrived with the first Hawaiians 1,500 years ago, but the rate of encroachment has risen steadily since Captain Cook's landing in Hawaii in 1778.
"The early Hawaiians altered the lowlands considerably," Linda Pratt, a veteran National Biological Survey botanist, told me one morning as she showed me around the park, pointing out its astonishing -- and imperiled -- biological diversity. "But they had virtually no impact on these upland systems. What we're looking at today is 200 years of change, very recent in biological terms."
We stood in a bright patch of forest, the stout trunks of native koa and soapberry trees -- some of them several centuries old, Pratt said -- rising dozens of feet straight up around us. Pratt's excitement flashed through her large round eyeglasses, which lent her a certain schoolteacherish charm. We'd been joined by David Foote, a National Biological Survey entomologist, and both he and Pratt wore blue raincoats as well as black, knee-high rubber boots that they would wash upon returning to the park supply trailer. "We regularly clean our boots off," Pratt said, "so that we don't carry any nasty alien seeds into the native forest."
More than the ancient beauty of the spot, what impressed me was the racket. All manner of avian twitter, warble, whistle and chirrup cascaded from the canopy, as though every native bird in the state had materialized overhead, safe from foreign invaders like the brown tree snake. Pratt cocked an ear to the din, then smiled ruefully. It turned out I'd been marveling at aliens.
"That's either a Japanese white-eye or a European house finch," she said, looking up and to her left. She jabbed her thumb in the opposite direction. "And that's a cardinal over there. That's what gives New England forests their distinctive summer sound. Unlike the alien insects and plants, the vast majority of alien birds were intentionally introduced here. There was a private group of bird lovers called A'hui Manu -- the Bird Group, in Hawaiian -- and they introduced yellowfern canaries, saffron finches, laughter waxbills, cardinals. They wanted to see these beautiful songbirds flying around."
The problem with this arrangement, Pratt explained, is that the alien birds feed on the fruits of alien plants and spread their seeds throughout the lowlands -- and, increasingly, in the park. Park managers are currently waging a fierce battle against Myrica faya, an ornamental tree from the Azores that was imported in the 1940's, perhaps by lowland gardeners, and whose berries are cherished by house finches and Japanese white-eyes. In the wild, Myrica faya quickly forms tight stands -- thereby depriving native plants of light -- and enriches the soil with nitrogen, enabling other alien plants to take root in the otherwise uninviting volcanic substrate.
I asked about the fate of native birds and Pratt listed their enemies: rats, mongooses, iguanas, none of which evolved on Hawaii. Avian malaria is a relatively new problem, she added. Alien birds are primary carriers of the disease and are largely immune to it. Mosquitoes -- inadvertently brought to Hawaii in larval form during the 19th century in the water casks of Mexican ships -- transmit it to the native birds, which succumb in shivering masses, recalling the somber 19th-century proverb that echoed through the Hawaiian towns emptied by European epidemics: "Native death takes few at a time; the foreigners' death takes many."
And as go the birds, Pratt continued, so go the flora. "Some of the native lobeliads have long curved flowers, like the beaks of honeycreepers," she said. "It may well be that one reason for the extreme rarity of some of these plants is that they aren't being pollinated anymore."
In 1958, in his ground-breaking study, "The Ecology of Invasions of Animals and Plants," the biologist Charles S. Elton characterized an invader as "working his way somehow into a complex system, rather as an immigrant might try to find a job and a house and start a new family in a new country or big city." What Pratt and Foote were showing me was, in effect, a neighborhood in transition. Not every newcomer is a threat, Pratt said. Of the 600 species of alien plants in the park, most are botanically unable to spread and will be ignored by park managers. But a few invaders are irksome keystones: consuming or outcompeting the native residents, setting the stage for new invasions, until a new, alien network of ecological alliances forms and the old neighborhood is supplanted altogether.
Foote, a precise, soft-spoken man with hazel eyes and curly blond hair, suggested we drive his Range Rover to a different area of the park for a better view of the damage wrought by invaders. We parked along a misty, forest-lined road, then he led us down an embankment and into rain forest. Centuries-old hapu'u ferns, bearded with moss, fountained up tall and thick as trees. A black, fermenting humus sucked at our boots with every step. Pratt walked to where a fern trunk lay across the path -- pushed over, she said, by feral pigs. Pigs were introduced to the islands by the first Polynesian settlers, but the troublemakers running rampant today in the forest, Pratt said, are an entirely different breed, descended from the herds set loose by Captain Cook.
"These pigs weigh 200 pounds or more," she explained. "And they're perfectly capable of pushing a tree down. Then they rip 'em open -- they've got big teeth and tusks. The inside core is pure starch and the pigs hollow it out. About 90 percent of the time they kill the tree. Given enough time, they can completely destroy the forest. The native plants are adapted to low light levels, and the pig removes the ferns that keep the shade high and the invading plants out."
The native organisms, Pratt added, "aren't weak in any way. They're very well adapted to the conditions here." Yet, as she went on to explain, students of biological invasion have learned that island species, having evolved in isolation of ungulates and most predators, are particularly vulnerable to encroachment. Many Hawaiian birds lack the instincts to protect themselves from rodents and reptiles. (On Guam, the ground-dwelling birds were easy prey for the brown tree snake, while introduced birds like the Philippine turtledove, which tend to be more wily and reproduce faster, have fared better.) Similarly, many Hawaiian plants evolved without the defenses -- nettles, thorns, a toxic flavor, a hardy stem -- that enable their mainland relatives to ward off grazers and survive repeated tramplings. Finally, island populations are typically small and thus more likely to be obliterated by a single catastrophe -- hurricane, disease, invading snake.
Pratt bent closer to the fallen trunk, pointing to where the core had been gouged out. A small pool of stagnant water had formed -- ideal breeding grounds, she said, for the malarial mosquito.
"Even in these wet forests, it's otherwise hard for mosquitoes to find water to breed in," she said. Now the feral pig had created a foothold for the insects. "So everything is connected," Pratt sighed. "As is always the case. Screw up one thing and it has far-reaching consequences."
Standing there in the rain forest, at the muddy front in the battle against invading flora and fauna, Pratt had hit upon the frustration at the very core of invasion theory. Although ecologists would like nothing more than to predict which organisms will turn out to be successful invaders and which ones will not, their inquiry relies entirely on hindsight. An invader that can be studied is by definition one that has successfully gotten a foothold. The vast majority of invasions that fail, and the lessons that might be drawn from such failures, disappear without a trace.
For the moment, managers of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park must contend with the aliens already in residence, an effort that costs about $1 million in Federal funds annually. Several times a week, a crew of four employees dressed in white jump suits ventures into regions of the park that biologists have deemed especially rich in species; there, they aim machetes and squirt bottles of herbicide at the dozen most troublesome invasive plants. Another crew is responsible for erecting wire fences and eliminating feral pigs.
As it turns out, $1 million is a relatively modest amount in the war against alien species. Florida, which also boasts a semitropical climate and a diverse cache of endemic organisms, spends $5 million annually fighting hydrilla, an aquarium plant from Sri Lanka that was dumped into a canal around 1951 and has since emerged as a sort of underwater kudzu, choking some 75,000 acres of waterway. Everglades National Park spends $500,000 a year eradicating three fast-growing alien trees -- Australian pine, melaleuca and Brazilian pepper -- that crowd out native plants and the creatures that depend on them.
Still, my concept of Eden had not allowed for exterminators. Was the park preserving nature here or running an oversized "natural" garden? I put the question to Foote and Pratt.
"It's a world apart from an arboretum or a zoo," Foote responded after a moment's reflection. "Here, you have a functioning ecosystem that requires very little in the way of manipulation. We're not feeding the birds. We're not planting the plants. The insects that pollinate the plants serve as food for the birds and reproduce on their own. The only thing we do is keep out aliens. Once you get an alien species under control, it requires very little effort to keep it in check."
Pratt nodded. "If this forest is undergoing natural succession and is self-sustaining, then I think it's natural," she said. "The only thing that isn't self-sustaining is if we allowed the aliens to take over."
Yet what exactly is unnatural about alien species? After all, Hawaii's unique life forms evolved entirely from ancient colonists: a wayward finch, a spider that floated in from the mainland, a snail or a tick or a burr that dropped from the down of a roving sea bird. The question of what is native has lately become a heated one in Hawaii. When the Nature Conservancy began two years ago to remove feral pigs from its land on the island of Molokai, local hunters decried the effort as "eco-imperialistic," noting that the pig is a sacred element of the Hawaiian diet and culture. "To eradicate the pig," one native Hawaiian teacher said last year in a radio interview, "is like eradicating us." People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has stoked the confusion and resentment. "When animals who have been in Hawaii for 1,500 years don't behave precisely as the Nature Conservancy would like," one of its news releases declared, " 'diversity of life' becomes 'alien species.' "
Like most biologists in the state, Foote was familiar with the charged debate surrounding the question of what constitutes "native" and he expressed his thoughts with some reluctance, as if not wanting to give offense. "Many of the species that evolved on Hawaii have a lineage that can be traced back beyond the age of the oldest islands here," he finally said. "So we're talking about a heritage that goes back more than five million years. The entire chain of islands can be dated back more than 50 million years. Some groups of plants and insects have been island-hopping over that entire time period. To contrast that with an organism that was introduced in the last 1,500 years -- to say it's as native as these endemic insects and plants -- is just absurd."
The mist thickened into drizzle as we headed back toward the road, continuing the conversation. "Things will always be arriving," Pratt said at one point. "But the key element is the time frame. Even if all the people disappeared from the planet tomorrow, there will still be plant and animal introductions into Hawaii -- say one every 20,000 years. But the current rate is hundreds per year. Of those, maybe only one -- or none -- could possibly have gotten here on their own. To me that makes a huge difference.
"A few years ago, we had a group of kids from Great Britain working here, removing alien plants. And they couldn't really understand what we were doing: 'Why are you worried about these plants? Humans brought them here; humans are natural; therefore the invasion of alien plants is natural.' I tried to explain what our viewpoint was. Afterward, I came to feel that they couldn't understand it because they had grown up in Great Britain, where everything they looked at had been changed by humans thousands of years ago -- so long ago that these kids think it's normal."
ONE EVENING FOOTE invited me to his home for dinner. The house is a modest, rather rustic affair, as is just about everything in the small village of Volcano. A tall row of trees obscures his neighbors; a gravel road runs past. Foote lives here with his wife, Karin, a chemistry student at the local university, and two jittery dogs: Homer, so named for the three owners he'd passed through before Foote acquired him, and Sed.
"That's an acronym for Someone Else's Dog," Foote smiled.
He offered me a beer, then showed me a large gray moth he'd captured at his porch lamp the night before. In caterpillar form, Eupithecia monticolens thrives on the pollen of o'hia blossoms and the protein therein -- an unusual evolutionary adaptation, Foote said, since most caterpillars eat only foliage.
"The moths are attracted to lights," he added. "Residents of Volcano say that Eupithecia monticolens used to blanket the windows at night. Now you're lucky if you see one or two. Their decline seems directly related to the introduction of yellow jackets, which pluck them right off the o'hia blossoms. It's really dramatic to see. The yellow jackets first showed up in Hawaii around 1978 in a shipment of Christmas trees and they feed on a wide variety of insects. Unfortunately, they're reducing the amount of food for forest birds. The caterpillar is a primary prey item for three endangered passerines that are all missing now from the park."
Foote added that Eupithecia monticolens is thought to be the evolutionary precursor of 22 known species of Eupithecia caterpillar in Hawaii. Some of them are quite unusual, he said, and he suggested I stop by the park's lab the following day and have a look.
We met next morning in a small white room with metal stools and a row of microscopes on a counter along one wall. A bank of windows looked out onto the cluster of drab wooden buildings that make up the park's headquarters. Foote handed me a glass vial; stoppered inside was a slim leaf. On it, an inchworm sat erect: its hind end fastened to the stem by tiny legs and its segmented body sloping skyward, like a miniature leaf-green escalator. This is Eupithecia orichloris. How long ago it evolved into its own species is unclear, Foote said, since the Eupethecia genus was discovered only in 1978 and "there's no molecular phylogeny to tell how old it is." Nonetheless, Eupithecia orichloris has retained its ancestor's taste for protein. In fact, it and a half-dozen of its kin have taken this legacy to the extreme, Foote said. They are the world's only known carnivorous inchworms.
I watched with fascination as Foote shooed several ordinary fruit flies from a holding vial into the proverbial lion's den. The inchworm stood twig-still as they settled in. After a few minutes, a fly wandered into one of several sensitive hairs protruding from the hind end. Instantly, the inchworm struck, reaching over backward and nabbing its prey with -- I was watching now through a microscope -- two sets of clawlike legs. These immobilized the fly while the mandibles of Eupithecia began to graze: first on the tail, then the thorax, the wings, the still-wriggling legs -- until all that was left after 15 minutes were two amber geodesic eyes. Then these, too, were punctured and devoured. Eupithecia paused a moment, then stiffened in anticipation of its next meal.
I was riveted to the scene: Eupithecia lashing again and again, victim after victim reduced to a bolus dimly visible through its skin. Like the brown tree snake, the predatory caterpillars have adopted a surreptitious life style. One is gray and spiny like the decayed perches it favors; another is ornamented with tubercles resembling moss. One stations itself along the edge of koa leaves; another chews out the midrib of hapu'u fronds and lies there in ambush. And like the native birds that feed on them, Foote said, these Eupithecia are inching toward oblivion.
"Their prey are disappearing," he said. "Two species of fruit fly that they feed on are disappearing from the park."
It was as though the face of a watch had been suddenly pried off and the inner workings revealed. Hawaii's native birds, dim flickers on the radar of human awareness, face consumption at the jaws of an invading snake that is all but invisible to them and us. Yet extinction already threatens the birds from below -- a slow starvation imposed indirectly by alien yellow jackets, mosquitoes, pigs and songbirds that are well established here.
The French anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss lamented, at the start of the jet age, that the variety of human cultures is dissolving into uniformity. "Civilization has ceased to be that delicate flower which was preserved and painstakingly cultivated in one or two sheltered areas of a soil rich in wild species," he wrote in 1955. "Mankind has opted for monoculture; it is in the process of creating a mass civilization, as beetroot is grown in the mass."
As a direct consequence, a similar form of homogenization is now threating ecological cultures. As the human race spreads and its sphere of disruption widens, the natural world is winnowed only to those plants and creatures that can thrive in our wake. In effect, human civilization, history's most pervasive invader, has become a force of natural selection in its own right.
When I raised this notion with Foote, he nodded and replied: "We are increasingly dealing with a number of species that are associated with humans throughout the world. If that's what you want to live with -- a small suite of a dozen, maybe two dozen species -- then you can live with that, I suppose."
"HOW DO YOU PROVE TO people there's a problem," Earl Campbell had said at one point during our snake hunt on Guam, "if it's something they can't see?"
That is precisely the challenge ecologists face in the defense against biological invaders. Of the few government regulations that deal expressly with alien species -- including the Lacey Act, the main Federal law controlling the transportation of fish and wildlife, and the Federal Noxious Weed Act -- most take what's known as a "dirty list" approach: they bar entry to certain "injurious" foreign organisms and allow unlisted ones to be imported. Unfortunately, such listsare usually short and uncomprehensive. According to an Office of Technology Assessment report issued last year, "most of the world's fauna, excluding insects . . . could be legally imported into the United States." The approach is also inherently reactive. New species typically aren't added to the lists until their invasiveness is well proved -- overlooking the fact that most invaders are, like cockroaches, best dealt with before their presence is widely apparent.
For Hawaiians, however, even an invisible Boiga irregularis has become a sort of rallying point for their alien pest program. The State Department of Agriculture has stepped up its demand to inspect incoming first-class mail, which often contains contraband plants and insects. (The United States Department of Agriculture long ago won the right to inspect first-class mail leaving Hawaii for the mainland, but the state has not yet won equivalent access.)
The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii and the Natural Resources Defense Council have begun to coordinate the state's defense against invaders, pressing for stiffer penalties and urging the numerous agencies involved -- the Federal and military customs services, Fish and Wildlife, the Department of Health, the Hawaii Farm Bureau, among others -- to share information about inspection strategies and incoming aliens. The challenge is how to protect a state more ecologically rich than the Galapagos Islands without demanding that tourists set no more than their eyes on shore.
"How do we remain the hub of the Pacific," asks Alan Holt, science director of the Nature Conservancy of Hawaii, "yet also maintain the value that isolation brings?"
In a larger sense, that has been the predicament from the start. Humans are by nature exploratory beings, determined to breach the barriers that isolate us from the rest of the world. Yet our habit of travel is inherently detrimental to the ecological islands in our path, which cannot maintain the pace of cultural change. One might ask: So what? Paradise, that mythical plot of nature immune from human influence, was lost to us the moment we stepped into it eons ago. The ecological clock is destined to wind down. Why try to halt the inevitable?
"There's a loss of the features that allow you to describe where you live, where you're from," Earl Campbell had said when I posed this question to him. "Language is becoming homogenized. Foods are becoming homogenized. The things people do or see are becoming homogenized too. When you characterize where you're from, you look out your window at the plants and animals, even if you don't notice them immediately. I think there's something terribly wrong with the loss of a distinct sense of being. It comes down to: Where is my home?"
Arthur Medeiros, a biologist on Maui, agrees. "It's analgous to culture," he told me one afternoon in a restaurant at the foot of Haleakala, Maui's 10,000-foot extinct volcano. "Where do we stop this homogenization? We degrade the world unnecessarily if we ignore the small steps that come with keeping pockets regional."
A wiry man of Portuguese descent, Medeiros works in the volcano's crater at Haleakala National Park, the other main bastion of native flora and fauna in the state. And Haleakala is equally beseiged by invading species, a situation likely to worsen, Medeiros said, if plans are approved to open Maui's airport -- just 20 miles upwind of the park -- to international traffic.
A local teen-ager wandered up to our table, offering to sell a Jackson's chameleon for $20. Three of the beasts sat on his shoulder -- horned, swivel-eyed lizards from East Africa that have become a popular pet item on Hawaii and a potential threat to native birds and insects. Medeiros waved him off and returned to explaining his other activities: mediating the pig controversy and giving nature lectures at a nearby community college. If the threat of alien species is at heart a threat to our sense of self and home, Medeiros intends to make sure that Hawaiians fully understand their ecological legacy.
"Everything's happening fast here -- a deterioration of the natural resources, an appreciation of the culture," he said. "At some point, the culture is going to grab onto the resources and say: 'How can we be Hawaiians if the place doesn't look like Hawaii? If all the plants and animals are gone, why don't we just resuscitate the Hawaiian culture in San Jose, Calif.?' "
He paused for a moment, then stretched his arms wide and, still seated, began flapping them. Suddenly, and for a very brief moment, there issued from his mouth a shrill warble, like steam escaping: a perfect imitation of a thousand birds shrieking out a dawn chorus.
"I like a noisy forest," Medeiros said, letting his arms drop. "I'd like Hawaiians to hear that."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTION: TRANSITION;
Pataki Plans Major Overhaul To Shift Direction in Albany

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Governor-elect George E. Pataki will begin a sweeping overhaul of New York's state government this week, seeking to impose his Republican vision on a sprawling bureaucracy guided by Democratic policies and partisans for the last 20 years.
The effort will start with the appointment of commissioners and directors to run some 40 state agencies. The first is expected to be a state budget director, who will be faced with a shortfall of as much as $4 billion in the next fiscal year. 
 But the process will eventually entail hiring hundreds of deputies and assistants entrusted with the prosaic duties that affect almost every New Yorker, from setting utility rates to issuing drivers' licenses to supervising welfare programs.
By all accounts, the retooling will be extensive. The Governor-elect has direct power to replace anywhere from 2,500 to more than 5,000 state officials, and advisers to Mr. Pataki have suggested that they are prepared to make wholesale changes to insure that their control over a bureaucracy largely installed by Democrats is complete.
"The philosophies are at such different ends of the spectrum," said John E. Sweeney, executive director of the state Republican Party, "that I can't imagine there would be many people that will stick around."
Mr. Pataki has appointed only the core of a transition team, but it already provides indications of where he may recruit talent: Nassau County's Republican organization, the Assembly Republican minority and his Hudson Valley legislative district.
Changing the course of the government is expected to be as painstakingly slow as turning a supertanker. Replacing top Cuomo appointees could take until June. Then, carrying out the policies advocated by Mr. Pataki -- dropping regulations, cutting back agencies and reforming the Medicaid and welfare systems -- could take months longer as new policies trickle down through the 230,000-member state work force.
"The hardest thing in a bureaucracy is to change direction," said Mark Lawton, who helped in Gov. Hugh L. Carey's transition to Democratic from Republican rule in 1974 and later became his budget director. "It's almost easier to extinguish it. You can layer over it, which is what Nelson Rockefeller did. But we had to unravel it so we could push it in different directions."
The size of the task ahead for Mr. Pataki can be illustrated by a single department -- health. The agency has a $1.3 billion budget and 7,000 employees, of which dozens of high-ranking legal, public relations and executive positions are controlled by the Governor's office. With each appointment, Mr. Pataki can put his stamp on some aspect of health care, from running a state cancer institute in Buffalo to financing AIDS programs to setting the rates that hospitals charge their patients.
Mr. Pataki, 49, faces difficulties above and beyond the normal hurdles confronting any new governor. Republicans have not controlled the executive branch since Malcolm Wilson was Governor in 1974, which leaves Mr. Pataki no ready pool of professionals schooled in Republican ways of governance.
Like Mr. Carey, a Democrat who inherited a government controlled by Republicans for 16 years and plucked his first budget director, Peter Goldmark, from Massachusetts, Mr. Pataki is likely to recruit some top officials from outside New York.
Because of tensions within the Republican Party, Mr. Pataki is not likely to have ready access to the two big sources of Republican talent in the state: the staffs of the State Senate and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani enthusiastically endorsed Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, while the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, an Oyster Bay Republican, has feuded with Mr. Pataki and did little to support his campaign.
Furthermore, history suggests that the bitterness of the campaign may make for a bumpy handoff between Governors, even though Cuomo officials have promised a seamless transition.
When Mr. Cuomo prepared to take office from his fellow Democrat, Mr. Carey, in late 1982, Carey aides had already prepared thick briefing books for Mr. Cuomo's transition team. But when Mr. Carey unseated Mr. Wilson, the Republican, in 1974, his transition advisers had problems obtaining detailed information from some Wilson aides, Mr. Lawton said.
As if building a new government were not enough work, Mr. Pataki must immediately begin to address a projected $4 billion shortfall in the fiscal year starting on April 1. While he interviews hundreds of job candidates in the coming weeks, he will be preparing a budget of about $64 billion to be presented to the Legislature by Feb. 1 -- as well as writing an inaugural speech that will stake out his vision for the next four years.
"The campaign is over, but the hard work is just beginning," Mr. Pataki told a crowd of supporters in Buffalo last week.
Mr. Pataki did not exactly enter the transition with a running start. His advisers say his intense focus on winning the race, and perhaps a touch of superstition, prevented him from thinking beyond Election Day. Mr. Pataki himself said the day after the election that he considered it "the height of arrogance" to begin transition planning before winning.
Some aides said Mr. Pataki had begun to concentrate on the transition about two weeks before the election. But then Mr. Giuliani endorsed Mr. Cuomo and sent Mr. Pataki plunging in the polls. After that, almost all talk about transition ended.
Mr. Pataki has said he is studying how Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey handled her 1993 transition, a process that involved creating a central team with several committees that studied each of the state's agencies. The team then compiled a short list of nominees for high-ranking jobs for her to interview.
Mr. Pataki has started his own transition team, led by Michael C. Finnegan, his old friend, former law partner and legislative counsel, who has strong ties to Peekskill, where Mr. Pataki was once Mayor.
Also on the team is James G. Natoli, the chief of staff to Clarence D. Rappleyea, the Assembly Republican minority leader, who was a mentor to Mr. Pataki in the Legislature and co-chairman of his campaign. Mr. Rappleyea's staff, and many Republican Assembly members, assisted Mr. Pataki on the hustings and in developing campaign position papers on tax cuts and other issues.
Rounding out the team is John F. O'Mara, a lawyer from Elmira who is close to Mr. Pataki's political patron, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who comes from Nassau County.
Mr. Pataki, on vacation until Tuesday, is expected to name other transition team members this week.
Among those widely expected to be on the team are Joseph Holland, a Harlem lawyer and campaign co-chairman, who has been asked to help recruit from minority communities; Charles Gargano, a Long Island developer close to Mr. D'Amato who was the campaign finance chairman and will be Mr. Pataki's liaison to major contributors; Joseph N. Mondello, the Nassau County Republican chairman; William D. Powers, the state Republican chairman, and Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island Borough President, who was Mr. Pataki's New York City campaign chairman.
Several people expected to work on the transition are also prominently mentioned as candidates for high-ranking jobs. Pataki aides have talked to Mr. Holland about becoming Secretary of State, among other positions. Mr. Rappleyea is said to be interested in a cabinet post.
A major question for Mr. Pataki now is whether he distances his administration from the political forces that aided his election, particularly Mr. D'Amato.
"Campaign people need to be rewarded for their effort," said Mr. Lawton, who is studying gubernatorial transitions around the country. "But the campaigning and the politics are different from the governance. You have to decide who is competent. You really don't want to just hire friends because in a year, you'll regret it."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "CHECKLIST: Transition in Albany -- Openings and Opportunities"
 Here are some of the major positions Governor-elect George E. Pataki will fill in the coming weeks.
 
Director of the Budget -- The most important appointment for any new governor, but particularly this year, when Mr. Pataki wants to make deep income tax cuts at the same time that he must close a shortfall that could be as large as $4 billion in the fiscal year that begins April 1.
 The new budget director will play a central role in deciding how Mr. Pataki can structure his tax cuts and what belt tightening can be done to keep spending at the rate of inflation, as Mr. Pataki has promised. The position paid $105,805 this year.
 
Commissioner of Social Services -- Mr. Pataki has said he believes the state can save billions of dollars by requiring childless welfare recipients to work and by slashing the administrative costs of Medicaid, the health care program for the poor. To do either will require extensive changes in the way the department is run and strong leadership at the top.
Michael J. Dowling, the current Commissioner, has been cited by some Republicans as one of the few top Cuomo appointees Mr. Pataki might be willing to keep because of his strong efforts to push more welfare recipients into work programs. The position paid $102,335 this year.
 
Commissioner of Environmental Conservation -- As a legislator, Mr. Pataki developed a strong reputation among environmentalists for being committed to protecting natural resources. But he will be under intense pressure from the business interests that supported his candidacy to reduce the environmental regulations that can slow new real estate or industrial development. The job paid $95,635 this year.
 
Commissioner of Correctional Services -- The state corrections system of 69 prisons that now hold more than 66,000 inmates is overcapacity. Mr. Pataki has proposed a legislative agenda that, if passed, would increase the prison population by imposing longer sentences while eliminating early release and parole programs for violent felons. He has also called for reducing prison services by cutting frills like cable television and weight rooms. The jobs paid $107,706 this year.
 
Chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- The new Governor will have to juggle many political interest here. The authority operates New York City's bus and subway systems, suburban commuter rail lines and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. Mr. Pataki has said he would like to keep the subway fare at $1.25 next year, but doing that might involve cutting back on other expenses, such as subway station repairs.
 Mr. Pataki will also find himself under pressure to keep fares down for the suburban commuters who strongly supported him. And during the campaign, he called for reducing tolls on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge for Staten Island residents, a campaign pledge he will be hard pressed to ignore after the strong turnout for him in the borough. The position paid $150,000 this year.
 
Chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York -- Mr. Pataki's appointment here will help set the tone for his post-election relationship with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The corporation, particularly the chairman, have served important advisory roles in shaping city budgets. The corporation also controls a multimillion-dollar fund generated by the refinancing of bonds that can be used to assist the city in troubled times. The chairman's position is unpaid but there are per-day payments. (pg. B6)

HEADLINE: U.S. OFFERS CHINA DEAL TO RESOLVE A MISSILE DISPUTE

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Monday, Nov. 14

 BODY:
The United States has offered to forgive China's violations of an international missile accord and waive possible sanctions if China admits the violations, senior Administration officials said today.
If China accepts the offer it would help resolve one of the most difficult issues between the countries. But the plan would effectively reward China for simply telling the truth about any violations and could encourage other countries to flout the accord. 
 Senior Administration officials suggested the offer could head off a potential clash that would unravel the Administration's policy of changing Chinese behavior through incentives, not punishment.
The Administration estimates that sanctions, intended to punish Beijing, would also cost American companies billions of dollars in deals with Chinese firms that do business with the Chinese military or that are involved in high-technology civilian enterprises.
President Clinton raised the missile plan in broad terms when he met early today with President Jiang Zemin of China, United States officials said. The leaders are here for a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic forum. As Mr. Clinton began meetings with Asian and Pacific leaders, Administration officials said he would offer reassurances that the enormous setbacks Democrats suffered in the elections last Tuesday would not disrupt United States policy in the region. [Page A10.]
Under the missile proposal, the United States has asked China to fully disclose its past exports of M-11 missile technology to Pakistan. China has consistently denied making such exports.
After meeting with the Chinese President, Mr. Clinton said he was "pleased" by the progress the two countries had made on the missile issue, referring to an accord signed in Washington by both sides last month.
Under that accord, the United States agreed to lift the 1993 ban on the export of high-technology satellites to China in return for a new Chinese pledge to abide by the Missile Technology Control Regime, which bans the export of missiles that carry a payload of 1,100 pounds or more and that can travel at least 185 miles. China has not signed the accord, but has pledged to adhere to it.
Mr. Clinton also stressed that the United States needed to "understand more fully" exactly what missile equipment China had shipped to Pakistan in the past, a senior Administration official said.
If China admits now that it had exported complete missile systems, Washington says it would be willing to waive economic sanctions called for under United States law. But Washington would impose sweeping sanctions if China conceals past activities and the United States later documents that Pakistan had received missiles.
Mr. Clinton said that the United States "was not eager" to impose the strict sanctions that would be required if it turned out that entire missile systems had been shipped, a senior Administration official said.
"We have been confident for a long time that they were getting missiles," said one senior Administration official. "We have never seen the missiles, the so-called smoking gun. But all the circumstantial evidence suggests a sale."
He added: "We have been trying to resolve this to remove a potential time bomb in the relationship."
In August 1993, the United States banned certain high-technology sales to the Chinese as required by law after American intelligence said China had sent M-11 missile components to Pakistan in violation of the missile accord.
The sanctions barred the transfer of sensitive satellite systems for two years at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars to American business. But those sanctions were minor compared with what the Administration would be required to do by law if Beijing had sent complete missile systems.
The State Department presented its plan to the Chinese in recent months. When Defense Secretary William J. Perry raised it again during his trip to Beijing last month, the Chinese gave their standard response: We didn't do it.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher raised the matter a third time with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Jakarta last Friday.
There are a variety of views within the Administration over whether Pakistan actually has the missiles. Since mid-1993, the Central Intelligence Agency and part of the Pentagon have maintained that M-11 missiles are already in Pakistan. Other senior Administration officials are less certain, pointing out that none have been detected by spy satellites.
Mr. Clinton was determined to use today's meeting to emphasize the positive side of the relationship, and much of the meeting focused on the the nuclear accord that the United States reached with North Korea in Geneva. The United States has welcomed Chinese support for the accord, and the Chinese are expected to play a central role in the its implementation.
But there was also discussion of two other thorny issues in their relationship, including American concerns about China's poor human rights record and China's campaign to become a founding member of the global trade accord.
On human rights, Mr. Clinton said he welcomed the recent parole of eight dissidents but added that China had to make further progress to improve its human rights record if it wanted to see further improvement in its relations with the United States.
Beijing is eager for Mr. Clinton to accept its invitation to visit China, but Administration officials have said China's human rights record remains a serious obstacle to such a trip.
Mr. Jiang pressed the Administration on his country's desire to become a founding member of the global trade accord. Mr. Clinton reiterated the Administration's position that it wants China to be admitted to the accord, but that Beijing first must take further steps to open its markets as required under the trade accord.

HEADLINE: China Pressing to Join Trade Club

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 13

 BODY:
With its huge internal market and steep growth in exports to the United States, China's effort to become a founding member of a new world trading system could prove to be one of the significant trade events of this time.
As regional leaders gather in Jakarta, Indonesia, for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the United States and China are entering the final phase of long and heated negotiations over the terms for Beijing's entry into the World Trade Organization, the new international trade body that is to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in January. 
 [In a meeting in Jakarta on Monday with President Jiang Zemin of China, President Clinton reiterated that the Administration wants China to be admitted to the accord, but that Beijing first must take further steps to open its markets.
[On Sunday, the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said he was still not sure that Beijing could enter by year's end, Reuters reported. "China's offers, at this point, are not adequate," Mr. Kantor said after almost three hours of discussions.]
If the two countries cannot resolve their differences by the Dec. 31 deadline for China's entry, European Union officials have suggested a compromise that would allow China to become a founding member of the trade body, though in a state of temporary suspension of its rights until negotiations on full terms of entry could be completed within a fixed number of months.
Though all major trading nations have a stake in China's joining the new trading body, the Clinton Administration has taken a central role in the talks, in part because of Chinese trade barriers and a rising trade surplus with the United States: $18 billion in 1992, $23 billion in 1993 and an expected $30 billion this year.
Many American companies are losing market share to Chinese-made products at home while facing obstacles in trying to secure more access to overseas markets. Thousands of representatives of American corporations are in China, hoping to sell to, or invest in industries and markets there. But many are frustrated by barriers that limit profit or block the flow of earnings to the United States, or impede sales through quotas and other ways.
Importing a foreign car or a fax machine into China today means essentially paying for it twice -- once to the dealer, and an equal or greater amount to the tariff collector. The price of a domestic airline ticket for a foreign traveler is 50 to 60 percent more than that charged a Chinese traveler. It even costs a foreigner double the standard admission fee to take a stroll in the parks of Chinese cities.
"China's tariffs remain higher, more numerous and more dispersed than those of most other large developing countries," this year's World Bank study on trade reform says.
Washington has pressed the Beijing authorities to dismantle the labyrinth of trade barriers that protect many of their moribund industries and captive markets. American negotiators say that while China has taken a number of positive steps, it has made insufficient progress and needs to open industries like banking and finance to foreign companies.
But Beijing's industrial policy -- focused on helping develop essential industries like automobiles, telecommunications and petrochemicals -- raises questions whether the Communist leadership will adhere to commitments on market access.
Similar questions arise over China's commitment to protect intellectual property. Throughout the country, purchasing computer software, movie videos or compact disks for the most part means indulging and supporting the large pirate industries that flourish in coastal provinces. Few if any of the big pirate factories have been shut down by the Chinese authorities, although they have mounted a modest campaign against small vendors.
Charlene Barshefsky, the deputy United States trade representative, said recently that China-based pirate operations cost American industries $1 billion annually.
The China Daily reported on Friday that the authorities in Guangdong province "stopped a truck en route to Hong Kong and confiscated 3,250 pirated compact disks."
A Western diplomat said "this is a tiny, tiny fraction of the trafficking in pirated CD's." The diplomat emphasized that Chinese enforcement efforts still need to focus on the factories, not on small trucks crossing the frontier to Hong Kong.
Despite such concerns, there is wide agreement among nations that China should enter the global trading system as soon as possible, if only because as the world's most populous nation with one of the fastest-growing economies, it seems foolhardy to exclude it.
Though some Chinese industries will suffer from a loss of protection with China as a member of the World Trade Organization, others can prosper as a result of the Uruguay round of negotiations that were completed in December 1993 under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The World Bank estimates that China's exports can increase more than 35 percent if trade barriers are also lowered in the United States, Japan and Europe.
As former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore put it, "For reasons of peace and stability, integrating China into an international framework is not a question of choice, but of necessity."
Chinese leaders have capitalized on such sentiments and in recent weeks began an aggressive campaign to portray Washington's resistance to Beijing's joining the trade group as an unfair assault that does not take into account China's special status as a relatively poor and developing country.
In recent weeks, Clinton trade officials have fired back.
"I think China looked at the negotiations" and membership in the world trade group as "very important for political reasons," said Dorothy Dwoskin, an assistant trade representative. "And I think some of us who are negotiating with China see that membership is very important for economic reasons."
China has responded with tough-sounding statements.
"Denial of GATT access could turn China into a 900-pound gorilla unbound by the marshaling forces of a world trading system," said Chu Xiangyin, a senior trade scholar at Beijing University.
Li Zhongzhou, a senior negotiator with the Trade Ministry, warned that if Washington did not accept the concessions China had offered, it would be forced to go its own way on trade, creating a "chaotic situation."
Mr. Li said China had already reduced its tariffs 55 percent across the board and was committed to phasing out its quota restrictions by 1997. He said China had offered its bottom line, but American negotiators said they believed that China would not show its final hand until some time next month.

New Stance by Dole
 WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 (AP) -- Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, who is expected to become the Republican majority leader in January, said today that he wanted the Clinton Administration to endorse legislation shoring up the United States' ability to pull out of the new world trade accord if American interests were being harmed.
Mr. Dole, who so far has withheld his support for a trade agreement, said on CNN's "Late Edition" that he would submit his proposal "in the next couple days," adding, "I haven't signed off yet."
Under the accord, the headquarters group called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is to be replaced by the World Trade Organization, and some critics contend the new organization could infringe upon the ability of Federal, state or local governments to adopt and enforce their own laws and regulations.
A lame-duck session of Congress is scheduled to consider legislation putting the new agreement into American law, with voting expected by early next month.
Mr. Dole said today that he wanted to find out if the Administration would be "willing to support separate legislation" enabling the United States to pull out of the World Trade Organization. The bills before Congress provide for a review after five years of membership. But Mr. Dole said he wanted a speedier review.
"There has to be some way that if it appears we are sort of being sold down the river, that we ought to be able to get out" sooner than five years, he said in another interview on CBS's "Face the Nation."
An aide said the Senator had discussed his proposal on Friday with Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, and that the Administration had not yet responded.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, the current chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said today on the ABC program "This Week" that he was sure of only 26 of 60 Senate votes that may be needed to halt debate and enact the GATT enabling legislation.

HEADLINE: Rights Protests Undercut Indonesia's Standing at Asia-Pacific Forum

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Disturbances in East Timor today and a two-day-old sit-in at the United States Embassy here have moved Indonesia's human rights record into the spotlight at a meeting of leaders of the Asia-Pacific region.
President Suharto has been hoping to call attention to Indonesia's economic progress and enhance its international standing as host of the meeting, at which the leaders of 18 nations are expected to issue a declaration setting them on the path toward free trade by the year 2020. But the presence of world leaders and hundreds of journalists has increased the risk that the Indonesian Government would receive unwanted attention for its suppression of labor movements, its censorship of the press, and its invasion and annexation of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony. 
 This month is also the third anniversary of a violent crackdown in which Indonesian troops gunned down scores of demonstrators in Dili, the capital of East Timor. Hundreds of people rampaged through the streets there today.
"It was chaotic," Maj. Laedan Simbolon, an East Timor military spokesman, told Reuters. "Up to 1,000 youths armed with sticks, iron rods and stones were smashing shops, burning cars and hitting policeman."
The United States Embassy here had no comment on today's events in East Timor, saying it did not have enough information on what had occurred.
At the sit-in at the embassy, about 30 demonstrators prepared to spend their second night in the parking lot after having scaled a fence into the compound Saturday morning. The demonstrators, described as East Timorese students, are demanding that the Indonesian Government release the imprisoned leader of a guerrilla movement fighting for East Timor independence. They are also demanding to meet President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher, an embassy spokesman said. Such a meeting is "out of the question," he said. The embassy has, however, offered to have Ambassador Robert L. Barry meet with the protesters and convey their message to the President, an offer the demonstrators have not accepted.
The Indonesian Government has tried to play down both incidents. Willy A. Karamoy, a spokesman for the Indonesia Department of Information, said in an interview tonight that unrest in East Timor resulted from unemployment rather than from a desire for independence.
During the Portuguese colonization, Mr. Karamoy said, there was only one high school. After Indonesia took over in 1975, he continued, "we thought to support those people, to make those people clever, we built a lot of schools." But that produced a large group of educated people with no job opportunities, since there is no industry in East Timor, Mr. Karamoy said.
"I think the Portuguese were right," he said. "Build one school and let everyone else be poor."
Mr. Christopher said on Saturday that President Clinton would raise the issue of human rights in talks this week with President Suharto at the meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
But President Clinton is not expected to make human rights an issue at the meeting, which is supposed to be devoted to economic affairs. Washington has in the last year toned down its calls for human rights in an effort to improve relations with the booming nations of East Asia.
In a speech today to the Pacific Basin Economic Council, a group of businessmen, Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown said that forging economic and business ties is a better way to improve human rights than the "feel-good policy" of holding a news conference and making bellicose statements, something that he said accomplished nothing.
"We are using commercial engagement to pursue non-economic goals as well as economic goals around the world," Mr. Brown said.
But critics say the Clinton Administration's "commercial diplomacy" is merely a choice of economics over human rights.
Human Rights Watch/Asia is to issue a report on Monday saying that the commercial diplomacy policy is pushing human rights concerns to the sidelines.

TWO FREED IN EAST TIMOR
 JAKARTA, Indonesia, Nov. 13 (Reuters) -- Two American journalists who had been detained Saturday when they tried to enter East Timor apparently have been freed, a spokeswoman at the American Embassy in Jakarta said today.
"We have been assured they are on a flight back to Jakarta," said the spokeswoman, Pamela Smith, after speaking with Indonesian authorities.
Allan Nairn of Vanity Fair magazine and Amy Goodman of Pacifica Radio said they were were detained after arriving in East Timor to cover the third anniversary of a mass killing by Indonesian troops.
The two were present when the army opened fire on demonstrators in the capital, Dili, in November, 1991. The army put the death toll at 50; witnesses said it was 150.
The embassy spokeswoman said they had apparently traveled to East Timor without permission from the Indonesian authorities, but the two reporters contended that they had been told in advance that they could travel freely in East Timor.

HEADLINE: Clinton, on Asia Trip, Faces a Rougher Road

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Monday, Nov. 14

 BODY:
As President Clinton began meetings here with Asian and Pacific leaders including China's President, Administration officials said today that he would offer reassurances that the setbacks suffered by the Democrats in last Tuesday's elections would not disrupt American policy in the region.
Mr. Clinton's advisers said he nevertheless expected to be questioned, and perhaps tested, on the new limits to his power. Now that his party has lost control of the House and Senate, some said the President would appear weaker to his counterparts than in any meeting with foreign leaders since he took office 22 months ago. 
 A sense of unease among advisers traveling in Asia with Mr. Clinton has been aggravated by statements made in Washington by Representative Newt Gingrich, the Georgia Republican who is likely to be the next Speaker of the House. Mr. Gingrich said flatly over the weekend that he planned to cooperate but not compromise with the White House. Other Republicans, including Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the likely new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have vowed to seek deep cuts in foreign aid programs championed by the Administration.
But at the news conference on Sunday night in Manila, Mr. Clinton was careful to leave room for collaboration with his rivals. He sidestepped a question about Mr. Gingrich's remarks, saying that he intended to be "in the center." He said of the Republicans that "insofar as I can work with them, I will do my best to do it."
His day in Manila was filled with pomp and ceremony and he even took up the saxophone at a state luncheon. But prior to arriving here before midnight, Mr. Clinton took time to put the best face on his political predicament.
"We do not have a parliamentary system," he said in declaring that the election returns would not have any impact on his conduct of foreign policy or his role at the trade conference here. "The power vested by the Constitution in the President to represent the United States in foreign affairs, particularly in areas of this kind, is quite clear."
Mr. Clinton went on to portray his foreign policies as having won broad bipartisan support. But the President's sharp defense and his invoking of the Constitution nevertheless served as a reminder of the changes in the year since the last Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Seattle, when his leadership went unquestioned.
The three-day visit to Indonesia that Mr. Clinton began today also promises to be complicated by riots and demonstrations staged to call attention to the Indonesian Government's reported repression in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia in 1976. Because the agenda of the conference is limited to economic issues, the President said at the news conference in Manila that he would not raise his concerns about East Timor until a private meeting on Wednesday with President Suharto.
Among foreign officials who have met with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and others in the run-up to meeting here, Mr. Clinton's plight has already been a subject of intense interest, Administration officials said today. But they said they were confident that the President could put their concerns to rest.
"They're nervous any time there is a change in the Administration or a change in Congress," said Michael D. McCurry, the State Department spokesman. "I think just seeing the President engaged and working will be a big plus."
Mr. Clinton spent just 22 hours in the Philippines, where he praised the country as the United States's "oldest friend" in Asia. Even there, his difficulties won him a public statement of commiseration from President Fidel V. Ramos, who at the state luncheon told the President: "No prophet is accepted in his hometown."
In addition to meeting with President Jiang Zemin of China, Mr. Clinton's schedule also includes talks with Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama of Japan, Prime Minister Paul Keating of Australia and President Kim Yong Sam of South Korea.
Republicans have voiced sharp criticism of the Administration's agreement last month to help provide energy assistance to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear aspirations. As a result, some officials expressed concern that the Republican Party's rise might leave Japan and South Korea more resistant to Mr. Clinton's efforts to extract commitments from them to bear the heaviest burden of that aid, estimated at $4 billion.
And because Senator Helms and other Republicans have been outspoken about their determination to cut American foreign aid, Administration officials said Mr. Clinton's exchanges with leaders of countries like Malaysia could well be strained by new apprehensions. But Administration officials sought to minimize the skepticism that Mr. Clinton might face.
"What I detect is mostly curiosity," a senior Administration official said. "They are all asking two questions: One, how does it affect you? And two, how is it going to affect us?"
Before he began the political slide that led to last week's electoral defeat, the President had planned to have already won Congressional ratification for the global pact on tariffs and trade. He had intended to hold up that accord as an example of what the United States still hopes will be a firm commitment from the 18 leaders who will meet here on Tuesday to create a free trade zone in the Pacific by a certain date.
Instead, he and his advisers now fear that they may fall short in their efforts to win ratification of their pact in a lame-duck Congressional session at the end of month. At least for now, Malaysia is blocking a proposal by President Suharto of Indonesia to set the free-trade deadline at the year 2020. And White House officials here were still plainly trying to come to grips with last week's electoral defeat.
Among those pleading bafflement was Hillary Rodham Clinton, who told a questioner on Sunday that she did not yet know "exactly what the message from the voters was."
"Like many other countries, ours is searching for political meaning after the cold war," she said. "During it, we knew who our enemy was and how to organize our politics. Now many countries are looking for for a new government role, and there is widespread discontent."

HEADLINE: As Iraqis Scrimp, Their President Lives Lavishly, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
American officials trying to maintain support for economic sanctions against Iraq said today that since the end of the Persian Gulf war, Saddam Hussein has spent what may be as much as $1 billion on palaces and presidential retreats around the country.
At a time when many Iraqis are destitute, Iraq has not only repaired the damage allied bombings did to Government palaces during the 1991 war, but is also expanding them and building new ones, according to American intelligence reports. 
 Madeleine K. Albright, the United States Representative to the United Nations, plans to raise the issue of the conspicuous spending on Iraq's palaces as part of the campaign to maintain economic sanctions on Iraq, an issue that has divided the allies. The information was released just before the embargo is to come before the Security Council again.
Though Iraq has also done much to restore its electrical grid, public services and roads and bridges damaged in the war, the work on the residences for the elite underscores the contrast between rich and poor in Iraq, a nation of 20 million people where robberies are on the rise and even middle-class Iraqis are selling their furniture to make ends meet.
American officials say the work for the Government elite will triple the number of their residences, which include a Presidential Palace at Lake Tharthar that is more than four times as large as the White House.
American officials contend that Iraq has failed to meet all the United Nations' demands for lifting economic sanctions that were imposed after the gulf war. Now, pointing to the palaces, the officials say Iraq is crying poverty even as leaders squander money on themselves.
"The fact that Saddam Hussein is spending hundreds of millions to build palaces and refusing to use the humanitarian program the United Nations has authorized shows the hypocrisy of his claims that he is concerned about his people's suffering," an American official said.
The Central Intelligence Agency estimated the cost at $1 billion, though one American expert said that is, at best, a crude guess.
The Security Council has authorized Iraq to sell up to $1.6 billion of oil under United Nations supervision, with much of the proceeds going for food and medicine. But Iraq has refused, saying the resolution is an infringement on its sovereignty.
Critics of the sanctions policy also cite the opulent lifestyle of Iraq's rulers. They say that the palace construction shows that top Iraqi officials are firmly entrenched and have managed to insulate themselves from the effects of the embargo, leaving ordinary Iraqis to suffer.
In an effort to lift the sanctions, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is to meet on Monday with Mrs. Albright, who is Security Council President this month. He is expected to present a declaration of Iraq's formal recognition of Kuwait.
France and Russia, which support Iraq's position, want the Security Council to lift the embargo in six months. Iraq owes the Russians billions, which they hope to recoup from Iraqi oil revenues, while France also sees the possibility of lucrative deals with Baghdad.
But the United States and Britain have been firmly against lifting sanctions, arguing that Iraq has not completely dismantled its programs to develop weapons of mass destruction, and has refused to renounce terrorism or refrain from repression at home.
Western officials also insist that Iraq has kept property stolen from Kuwait during its occupation. Mrs. Albright plans to tell the Security Council that the United Nations has seen Kuwaiti vehicles and scientific equipment in Iraq, according to James P. Rubin, spokesman for the United States Mission to the United Nations.
In addition, American officials note that the Iraqi forces that menaced Kuwait last month were equipped with captured Kuwaiti equipment, including more than 200 Soviet-made armored personnel carriers and a battalion's worth of American-made M-109 artillery pieces.
As described by American officials, the Presidential complex at Tikrit contains at least 13 palaces and a lake that was created by diverting water from the Tigris river.

HEADLINE: To Black Audience in Brooklyn, Mayor Promotes Austerity Plan

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani took his message of fiscal austerity to a Bedford-Stuyvesant church yesterday, telling worshipers that his administration's budget cuts would produce some pain for New Yorkers, but were crucial to the survival of the city.
"We all understand that we have to come to terms with the city's very serious budget problems," Mr. Giuliani told the congregation at the Cornerstone Baptist Church. "That's the reason I am restructuring the city government. I don't want our city or its people now or in the future to be diminished, so we have to live within our means. My priorities are the same ones that I believe that you have." 
 Mr. Giuliani's comments come as the City Council prepares to begin hearings this week on the administration's proposal to close a $1.1 billion gap in the $31.6 billion budget, the second round of budget cuts planned by the Mayor. Many of Mr. Giuliani's critics have complained that plans to reduce the work force and cut financing for the city's schools and social services will be felt most severely by black and Hispanic New Yorkers.
In traveling to the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, Mr. Giuliani seemed to not only want to explain the budget cuts, but also to find some solace from a sympathetic audience on the criticism he has received for breaking ranks with the Republicans and endorsing Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who was defeated last week for a bid for a fourth term in office.
While Mr. Giuliani was speaking at the church, his budget plan was being criticized by Mark J. Green, the Public Advocate, who issued what he called a "Democratic Alternative" to the Mayor's latest round of budget cuts. "We believe that there is a more humane, democratic alternative to this draconian budget," Mr. Green said, "one that attempts to spare those whose very survival could be at risk from budget cuts."
Specifically, Mr. Green criticized the Mayor for plans to reduce funds for city-owned day-care centers, emergency food programs, recycling, libraries and maintenance for the city's bridges and tunnels.
Mr. Green's report contained a number of proposals, including using traffic agents in place of police officers at special events, consolidating administrative offices at the city's Human Resources Administration, delaying the reduction of the commercial rent tax and selling surplus city-owned office space.
Mr. Green said that he had issued the report on his own and given copies of it to Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, and the Mayor.
Speaking to reporters after his message at the church, Mr. Giuliani criticized Mr. Green's report, saying that it included some of the Mayor's own fiscal ideas and that it would create new taxes. "We'll look at his proposals," the Mayor said. "But I think Mark should wake up and realize the new world we're in and march ahead to the future rather than repeat all the mistakes of the past."
The Council begins its hearings today with officials from the Board of Education and the Mayor's budget office testifying on the impact of budget cuts in education. Thomas L. McMann, director of the Council's finance division, said that the leaders of the Council would seek to restore financing for day care centers and emergency food programs and some of the budget for social services.
Under the City Charter, the Council can only approve or reject the Mayor's budget proposals as a whole. But the Council can negotiate changes with the Mayor and ask him to resubmit the budget plan.
In his address at the church, on Lewis Avenue, Mr. Giuliani took pains to tell the congregation that his budget proposals were intended to provide long-term financial stability for the city.
"I don't like the idea of having to remove anyone's job," Mr. Giuliani said. "But it was done in order to stimulate the economy of the city. And thank goodness we've had a much larger growth in private jobs than we've had a reduction in public jobs." He also sought to reassure the congregation, saying that his administration was "spending the greatest percentage of the budget on education and changing the direction in which the dollars for education are spent."
While Mr. Giuliani spent much of his time at the church laying out his fiscal plans for the overwhelmingly black audience, it was clear that he has not yet placed behind him the matter of his endorsement of Governor Cuomo. Speaking in an area of the city that supported Mr. Cuomo over Governor-elect George E. Pataki by a margin of about 17 to 1, Mr. Giuliani repeated that he had no regrets about his endorsement.
"The wonderful thing about following your conscience is that you can live with yourself however the decision comes out," Mr. Giuliani said, with worshipers shouting "Amen." He added: "In my situation, a lot of people would say, the devil made me do it. But I can't blame the devil, I did it myself."
While Mr. Giuliani was speaking, H. Carl McCall, who was elected state Comptroller, said that the vehemence of Mr. Giuliani's support for Mr. Cuomo had stunted enthusiasm for the Governor among black New Yorkers.
"There was a backlash," Mr. McCall said, speaking on the WNBC-TV program "News Forum." "The Governor wrapped himself so much in Giuliani that that turned people off. And it raised the suggestion that the Governor had not been helpful enough to Mayor Dinkins," who was defeated by Mr. Giuliani, "and therefore there was some deal between Giuliani and Cuomo that went back some time."
Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that he had still not heard from Mr. Pataki, after the Mayor placed two calls offering congratulations. On his regular radio program yesterday morning, Mr. Giuliani said: "Personally, I am not offended. But governmentally, when I called, I called as the Mayor of the largest city in the state and the economic engine that drives the state."

HEADLINE: In Europe, the Right Also Rises

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: VIENNA, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Jorg Haider, an athletic-looking and charismatic 44-year-old, is the new European right personified, one of the rising conservative populists who may be the wave of the future or a troubling throwback to the fascist past.
What is certain is that he and others like him have an undeniable fascination for voters who, as in America, seem fed up with politics as usual and want government off their backs. 
 Mr. Haider, an Austrian politician who heads the Freedom Party, says openly what many voters only dared to think privately before he came on the scene -- that their schools are being overrun by the children of foreign immigrants who cannot speak German, that most powerful institutions in the country are run by functionaries controlled by bloated political machines, and that they are just not going to take it any more.
Nearly 23 percent of the voters in Austria's Oct. 9 legislative elections, up from 16.6 percent in 1990, voted for the Freedom Party, which is almost totally identified with Mr. Haider. That gave the party 42 of 183 seats in Parliament.
Next January, Mr. Haider says, he plans to leapfrog parties entirely and create a Ross Perot-style popular movement called Citizens' Alliance '98, which he hopes will bring him to power by 1998. He promised that when he became chancellor, illegal immigrants would be thrown out, jobless foreigners would be sent home, and the two Austrian parties that have monopolized power for nearly 50 years would be relegated to the opposition.
"A movement needs a fuhrer," said Simon Wiesenthal, the veteran Nazi-hunter and survivor of Hitler's concentration camps, echoing the many Haider critics who see him as a crypto-neo-fascist.
Mr. Haider, wearing blue jeans and a blazer with a dark blue polka-dot tie during an interview in the parliamentary offices of his Freedom Party, dismissed the accusation.
"People say that just because I am openly an anti-socialist," he laughed. "The downfall of Communism of course mobilized all the forces that fear their socialist ideals are in danger of disappearing and brand their opponents as fascists, extremists and whatever."
The Haider phenomenon is just one of the aftershocks from the collapse of the Berlin wall five years ago, which marked the end of the cold war and undermined Western European political assumptions of the post-World War II era.
One such assumption was that there was no room for neo-fascism in the political system. That idea was swept away by the collapse of Italy's Christian Democrats amid corruption scandals last winter, when the populist movement led by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi came to power with the support of the neo-Fascist National Alliance.
The National Alliance leader, Gianfranco Fini, 42, wears stylish double-breasted suits instead of jeans, but otherwise bears comparison to Mr. Haider, even if the latter resents it. Mr. Fini is also surging in popularity lately, putting Mr. Berlusconi in the shade in public opinion polls.
And now he has moved to distance himself from the most avowedly Fascist component of his group, the Italian Social Movement, established by the heirs of Mussolini after the war. Mr. Fini recently announced plans to dissolve the movement and make the National Alliance a broad citizens' group like the one Mr. Haider wants to create in Austria.
Mr. Fini and Mr. Haider seem to draw on some of the same wellsprings of support. "Our values today are not those of Fascism," the Italian said in an interview last summer. "People voted for us first of all because all the established parties were corrupt, because they knew we were not an anti-democratic party, and because we stood for values that were not simply materialistic."
Mr. Haider put it this way: "In Italy the political system is collapsing because it is corrupt. In Austria it will be also be the same over the next few years, and a completely new political system will be the result."
In other countries as well, the far right has had the most success where frustration with established parties is greatest. In Belgium, the far-right Flemish Bloc surged in popularity in local elections this fall, getting 28 percent of the vote in Antwerp, where Socialist and Catholic parties have dominated city politics since 1921.
"We say openly what most people think," said Filip Dewinter, a Flemish Bloc candidate who ran on a platform of separate schools for Flemish and Islamic children and of shipping jobless immigrants back to their home countries. Among Mr. Haider's campaign slogans in Austria were "He says what we think" and "Vote the way he thinks."
Support for the biggest far-right party in Germany, the Republicans, collapsed in the Oct. 16 elections there. The main reason was that the mainstream parties reached consensus a year earlier on constitutional change to stem an influx of foreign asylum-seekers and immigrants that peaked at nearly 500,000 in 1992. Right-wing violence against foreigners and shelters for asylum-seekers has also diminished since then, though it has not stopped.
Here in Austria, uneasiness about foreigners was only one reason for Mr. Haider's stunning success.
"The main cause of his success is popular frustration with the political system," said Heide Schmidt, a former ally of Mr. Haider who broke with him nearly two years ago over his insistence on a popular referendum on immigration.
"A few years ago, when I still belonged to the Freedom Party, we wanted to visit a city retirement home here in Vienna, which has been ruled by the Social Democrats since the war," she said.
"The administrators wouldn't let us in -- they said it was a Social Democratic retirement home, and that is symptomatic of the confusion between parties and the Government here," Mrs. Schmidt added. "Haider knows how to expose these things, how to evoke positive feelings about himself while exploiting negative feelings about issues, and if the Social Democrats don't come to their senses pretty soon, it's quite possible he will become Chancellor in 1998."
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's Social Democratic Party and Foreign Minister Alois Mock's People's Party, which follows Christian Democratic politics, have shared power in a coalition since 1986. Both lost voters by the hundreds of thousands to Mr. Haider in October.
Among the supposed abuses of power he promised to end then was the cozy system of highly paid Social Democratic and Christian Democratic functionaries running not only nursing homes but also labor unions, social security agencies, banks, television stations and newspapers, and making party membership the main criterion for jobs.
"We have been in power for eight years, and we have to work hard to make our accomplishments more highly visible," Mr. Vranitzky said in an interview.
"Haider offers oversimplified solutions to complicated problems," the Chancellor said. "We clearly need better ways of teaching children in schools where there is a high concentration of non-German-speaking students, but there is no sense in doing what he says and sending 20,000 foreigners home to make room for 20,000 Austrians to hold jobs because they don't take jobs away from Austrians."
Multiculturalism, Mr. Haider says, is a pernicious leftist doctrine, but he is not against immigrants who seek full integration here. He is just for an immigration law that makes it possible to keep them out.
Official figures count 600,000 foreigners now in Austria, fewer than 8 percent of the 7.6 million population. More than 10 percent of them are unemployed, compared with 5.5 percent in the whole work force.
Mr. Haider asserted that many foreign workers legally in Austria see him as a protector, because they, too, feared illegal immigration.
His opponents unfairly tried to smear him, he said, by suggesting that he sympathized with policies of the Nazis because he once suggested in the heat of debate that they had been successful in fighting unemployment in the 1930's. In the ensuing uproar, he had to resign the governorship of Carinthia.
Today he says his words were taken out of context, but he does not disavow them.
"It was just a single sentence," he said, "but without it I probably wouldn't be where I am today."

HEADLINE: Harlem Dreams Are Revived For Trade Center and Hotel

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Nearly given up for dead after more than five years of delays, the long-awaited plan to build an international trade center and hotel on West 125th Street in Harlem appears to be back on track.
On Thursday, the state's Urban Development Corporation is expected to approve a revised plan for a 22-story complex at 125th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard (formerly Lenox Avenue). The U.D.C.'s approval would clear the way for the next phases of development: the selection of a construction management company, the choosing of an operator for the hotel and the signing of tenants for the office space. 
 "At long last we are approaching the final step," said Percy E. Sutton, the Harlem businessman and former Manhattan Borough President, who took over last year as the unpaid chairman of the International Trade Center Corporation, the nonprofit U.D.C. entity that is developing the project, which is next to the Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. State Office Building.
The plan the U.D.C. board will consider on Thursday is smaller than the one announced with great fanfare in 1989. Instead of a 30-story, 687,650-square-foot project, the new design is approximately 400,000 square feet and only 22 stories. At $83 million, the revised project will cost about half that of the original.
But the features that supporters of the trade center, like Congressman Charles B. Rangel, have longed dreamed of bringing to Harlem will still be there. They include a 100-room hotel, a conference center for up to 750 people and a first-class office building in the neighborhood.
As with the original plan, the money for building the project would come from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which has set money aside for it since 1988. By the time construction starts, in early 1996, that pool of money -- which has been earning interest all along -- is expected to be between $64 million and $67 million, Mr. Sutton said. The rest of the money would come from private financing raised after office leases have been signed.
The Port Authority has agreed to rent space in the office building, and Mr. Sutton said eight hotel management companies had submitted bids to operate the hotel. The trade center project is expected to generate about 900 construction jobs and nearly as many permanent positions once the half-square-block complex is in operation.
Back in the late 80's, the project was hailed as a symbol of Harlem's rebirth. The announcement came at the end of a decade in which the landmark Apollo Theater had been restored and once-empty storefronts of 125th Street were filling up.
But plans for the trade center fell victim to the collapse of the city's real estate market in the early 1990's, a collapse that also helped kill other private-public development projects, like Mortimer B. Zuckerman's plan to redevelop New York Coliseum site at Columbus Circle.
The main obstacle to development of the trade center was the shortage of prospective tenants, as the private financing for the project was contingent on the signing of leases for the office space. Trade center officials had hoped to draw mainly from companies and trade delegations from African and Caribbean nations, but since no leases had been signed, the private developers never moved forward.
At one point, Mr. Sutton said, the trade center project nearly lost out to a plan to build a Caldor store with an office building above it on the site. But hope revived when Harlem and the South Bronx were selected as likely sites for one of six urban Federal Empowerment Zones, which use tax breaks to encourage economic development. Although the trade center project does not depend on being in an Empowerment Zone, Mr. Sutton said the designation of Harlem and part of the South Bronx will enhance the project's chances of success.
The latest design for the complex, by the Harlem-based architect Roberta Washington in partnership with Mitchell/Giurgola Architects, calls for a five-story base holding retail space, a restaurant, the lobbies for the hotel and conference centers, and two floors of office space. The hotel rooms and most of the offices would be in the tower above. An adjacent building, to be built above an existing parking garage, would have meeting rooms, a ballroom and exhibition halls.
"With the number of groups and churches in our community that now have to leave the neighborhood in order to hold their events, we are confident that the conference center will support itself without revenue from the hotel," Mr. Sutton said.
Mr. Sutton said the U.D.C. board's backing of the project would represent final approval. If construction starts in early 1996 as planned, the complex could be open for business two years later.

HEADLINE: Disney Mulls Big Florida Expansion

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company is close to approving the investment of as much as $2 billion to expand Disney World, its theme park in Orlando, Fla., a person close to the company said yesterday.
In considering the expansion, Disney is trying to address two problems: a general slide in attendance at Disney World in the last few years and increasing competition from another Orlando theme park, Universal Studios/Florida, owned by MCA . MCA is planning to add 4,000 hotel rooms at Universal Studios. 
 Disney executives have been trying to decide whether one or more additional attractions at Disney World would draw new visitors or simply steal customers from other attractions at Disney World.
Disney World, which opened in 1971, has three components -- the Magic Kingdom, Epcot Center and the Disney-MGM Studios.
The investment under consideration would include more than $750 million to develop a fourth component, tentatively called Animal Kingdom. If the board goes ahead, Animal Kingdom, featuring animals from Asia and Africa as well as rides, would be built on 500 acres and open in 1998 or 1999.
The Orlando Sentinel, in an article yesterday discussing Disney's plans, said Disney would also open a water park called Blizzard Beach and possibly build an additional three hotels.
The Sentinel said the number of visitors to Disney World had declined by almost 5 million a year, to 28.9 million this year, from a peak of 33.7 million four years ago.
While the company does not release specific attendance figures, its executives acknowledged the decline, The Sentinel said, and suggested that the contributing factors were a sluggish European economy, uncertainty over the American economy and crimes against tourists in Florida, all of which hurt tourism.
Others inside and outside the company, The Sentinel said, suggested that many vacationers found Disney too expensive, noting that a single-day, adult admission ticket to the Magic Kingdom had increased to $38 from $18 a decade ago.
In addition to Disney World, the Walt Disney Company operates Disneyland, its first theme park, which opened in 1955 and is in Anaheim, Calif., and Euro Disney, a park outside Paris in which it owns 49 percent. Euro Disney, which opened in 1992, has been a money-loser, never generating the anticipated crowds.
This has been a trying year for the Walt Disney Company, despite the extraordinary success of "The Lion King," which is likely to wind up the biggest money-maker in Hollywood history, with more than $1 billion in profits after licensing royalties and video sales are counted. Such success can offset a multitude of problems, and that's just as well for Disney.
The company had had bad news, too:
*In April, its president, Frank G. Wells, died in a helicopter crash.
*In July, its chairman and chief executive, Michael D. Eisner, underwent quadruple bypass surgery, which reminded many people that a successor to Mr. Wells had not been named.
*In August, Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chairman of Walt Disney Studios, who was widely credited with reviving the animated operations, resigned after the Disney board declined to name him president. Weeks later, Mr. Katzenberg announced he would team with the director Steven Spielberg and the recording entrepreneur David Geffen to create a Hollywood studio -- including an animated operation that hopes to challenge Disney's supremacy.
*In September, after months of controversy, Disney announced it was abandoning plans to build a historical theme park, Disney's America, near Civil War battlefields in northern Virginia. The project had won local approval but inspired fervent opposition from historians and from environmentalists. The company has said it will seek another site for the park.
Disney also spent some a considerable amount of time this year deciding whether to pursue the acquisition of a television network. That interest seems to have cooled in recent months. One analyst who insisted on not being identified said an expansion at Disney World would not preclude the television purchase, because Disney had the financial resources to do both.
In each of the last fourth quarters, the Disney Company has reported revenues in excess of $2 billion.
The failure of the Virginia plan might have given Disney's board some incentive to proceed in Orlando, but the contemplated expansion in Orlando has been under discussion for many months.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
In Prague, a New Daily for English Speakers

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Nov. 10

 BODY:
The first English-language daily newspaper in Eastern Europe since the collapse of Communism is to be introduced on Monday by a young American publisher who has made a name here with a daily fax publication.
The eight-page paper, called The Bohemia Daily Standard, is intended for the growing number of business travelers and resident English-speaking business executives and diplomats in Prague. 
 The English-language newspaper choices are rationed in East European countries outside Russia. There are two independent weeklies published in English here, The Prague Post and Prognosis, but they do not cover local or foreign news in depth, a niche the new paper hopes to fill. Three English weeklies of varying quality and focus are published in Budapest, and one in Warsaw.
In addition, The International Herald Tribune, The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal are available daily in Prague, but many English-speaking readers say that these papers do not cover Czech affairs adequately.
"There's a gap of daily news for foreigners," said Erik Best, the publisher of The Bohemia Daily Standard, who has been putting out his fax publication, Fleet Sheet, since 1991. "And there's so much self-censorship in the Czech press that a truly independent paper will be able to say things the Czech press is afraid to say."
Mr. Best, 32, a graduate of Georgetown University who holds an M.B.A. from the University of North Carolina, said there were many aspects of Czech business life and politics that needed solid reporting.
"People are interested in corruption, and there's a lot going on," he said. "In a place that purports to be Western, they are getting away with third world things and calling themselves Western."
The banking system, for example, would appear to be a prime target for aggressive news coverage. There have been several bank failures recently, as well as reports of under-the-table payments for loans. "You go to a bank and can get an appraisal on your building that suits you," rather than one based on the market value, he said.
The paper has a start-up editorial staff of 20, including the editor, Francis Harris, a former foreign correspondent for The Daily Telegraph in Britain, and the deputy editor, Peter Green, an American correspondent who covered the war in Bosnia for United Press International. The business editor is Joe Cook, who writes for The Economist from the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Reporters include a mixture of young Czechs and foreigners.
The paper's debut comes near the fifth anniversary of the ouster of the Communist regime on Nov. 17, 1989, when Wenceslas Square in Prague was jammed with tens of thousands of Czechs demanding a new Government. To mark the occasion, The Bohemia Daily Standard will run anniversary photographs and an article by President Vaclav Havel.
Mr. Best expressed hope that the paper, which will cost 10 crowns, or about 30 cents, would grow to a circulation of 5,000 to 10,000. Estimates of the number of English-speakers in the Czech Republic range from 10,000 to 25,000. McDonald's and Coca-Cola have signed advertising contracts, Mr. Best said, and DHL, Lufthansa and British Airways bought ads in the preview issue.
Mr. Best said he was the majority owner of the paper and had financial backing from BankAustria.
Fleet Sheet, a one-page English summary of the principal items of financial and political interest that appear in the main Czech newspapers each morning, has a circulation of several hundred, he said. It costs $750 a year and has become essential reading for non-Czech speakers in senior corporate positions here as well as for investors in London.

HEADLINE: Mexican Chief Urges Talks on Freer Flow of Migrants

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TIJUANA, Mexico, Nov. 12

 BODY:
With Mexican anger still building over the approval of a California ballot initiative to cut social services to undocumented immigrants, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has said Mexico and the United States will have to discuss a freer flow of migrant workers just as they negotiate free trade.
Little more than two weeks before his six-year term is to end, Mr. Salinas argued that some sort of bilateral agreement on a greater legal flow of Mexican migrant workers northward is the only way that the problem might be controlled. 
 "I am not proposing that millions of Mexicans go to the United States -- we want them in Mexico," Mr. Salinas said in an interview as he flew to this border city on Saturday night. "That movement is inevitable, and it is better to order and regulate it than to confront it with administrative measures that are not going to stop it because the force of the economies is greater."
Mr. Salinas said he did not intend his call for such discussions as a formal proposal. Barred by the Constitution from seeking re-election, he will leave the presidency on Dec. 1.
But his remarks are nonetheless an important indication of Mexico's growing frustration with the hardening American line against illegal immigrants, and his views closely reflect those of his hand-picked successor, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon.
Both men have assailed the immigrant-control initiative in California, Proposition 187, as misguided and xenophobic, and both have said they would do what they can to protect Mexican migrants while helping to fight the measure in the courts.
Having pushed for the North American Free Trade Agreement over the qualms of nationalistic compatriots, both men are also acutely sensitive to Mexicans' outrage at the ballot measure's sweeping approval in a year that was to have ushered in a new spirit of cooperation between Mexico and the United States.
News of the vote and its possible effects has dominated newspaper headlines for days. Mexican protests have ranged from official rebuke at the United Nations to the bitter complaints by the Mexican winner of the New York City Marathon and the ransacking of a McDonald's restaurant in Mexico City by a gang of masked youths. It has seemed to matter little that challenges to the initiative in Federal and state courts could limit or delay its enforcement for years.
As the proposition was being debated, Mexican officials roundly snubbed a big California trade exhibition in Mexico City, the sort of event to which investment-hungry government technocrats would usually flock. With limited success, Mexicans living near the California border organized boycotts of shopping in the United States. And earlier this month, the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico warned that the expanding trade between the two countries could become "a tragic casualty" of the proposition.
Mr. Salinas played down that threat. Backing away somewhat from what has been an unusually direct Mexican challenge to an issue of American domestic politics, he said, "We do not have the means, faced with a domestic decision, to promote a sanction in material terms."
Noting the Clinton Administration's opposition to the California initiative, he said Mexico's protests might be far angrier had the country not come to understand more of the complexities of American politics in the course of the fractious American debate over the free trade accord.
"There is a better understanding that the attitude of the United States toward Mexico is not monolithic," Mr. Salinas said. "As a consequence, the reaction in Mexico is not monolithic against the United States now. There is an enormous concern about 187, but at the same time, it is not a national antagonism of Mexicans against Americans."
He reiterated his belief that the trade accord is creating jobs in Mexico that will eventually ease the economic pressures driving migrants to the United States. But he also argued far more clearly than he has before that an agreement on the flow of migratory workers was a necessary complement to the trade pact.
"I proposed it at the moment at which the negotiations for the Free Trade Agreement began," he said. Mr. Salinas added that the Bush Administration responded that an immigration side accord "had such a dimension and was of such ambition that it would make the Nafta practically impossible, that, as a result, it was better to take up one negotiation."
"If we already have a treaty on the free movement of merchandise, and that merchandise is produced by people," he continued, "it seems inevitable to me that Mexico and the United States will have to take up a negotiation like that."

HEADLINE: Now Myanmar Must Choose

 BODY:
Myanmar's ruling junta, the State Law and Order Restoration Council, or Slorc, is one of the world's most brutal, least legitimate regimes. It seized power in what used to be known as Burma by massacring democracy demonstrators in the streets of Rangoon six years ago. Since then it has ignored elections, cooperated with drug lords and waged a relentless war against democratic political leaders, university students, Buddhist religious activists and the ethnic minorities who make up more than a third of Myanmar's population.
This grim dictatorship is now being courted by countries eager for new economic opportunities in the world's hottest boom region. These include many of Myanmar's Southeast Asian neighbors and much of the European Union. To the east, Thailand makes refugees fleeing the Slorc's repression feel unwelcome. To the north, China provides military aid, consumer goods and diplomatic support. The U.S. stands almost alone in principled opposition to the Slorc, denying it anti-narcotics aid and development assistance, blocking loans from international banks and criticizing it in international forums. 
 But these steps have had only a limited effect. So this month the Clinton Administration dispatched a diplomatic emissary to offer the Slorc a choice. It can soften its tyranny and enjoy better relations with the U.S. or it can continue its thuggish ways and have Washington step up the pressure. The Slorc is still weighing its response.
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Hubbard asked the Slorc's strongman, Gen. Khin Nyunt, to respect internationally recognized human rights, admit U.N. and Red Cross observers, end forced labor, fight drug trafficking, devise credible, democratic procedures for a return to constitutional rule and free, unconditionally, the democratic opposition leader and Nobel laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi as well as other political prisoners.
Progress on these points could lead to warmer relations, eased sanctions and renewed cooperation against drugs. No progress would lead Washington to broaden U.S. sanctions and push for an international arms embargo. Some of Mr. Hubbard's points resemble the human rights conditions the U.S. earlier tried to apply to China, then dropped. This time the Administration appears more united and serious. That leaves the next step up to the Slorc.

HEADLINE: The Contract's Brutal Arithmetic

 BODY:
Republicans have pledged to vote within 100 days of taking control of the House on a "Contract With America," a package of 10 bills that offers government reforms, tax cuts and deficit reduction. Newt Gingrich, the likely next Speaker, has vowed to honor the pledge promptly.
Voting on the contract will be easy. Paying for the package will not. The social and economic costs could be staggering. Mr. Gingrich could find himself undermining the Republican governors who now run every large state except Florida. His contract threatens programs that big-state governors need for large pockets of disadvantaged residents. 
 The contract includes proposals to fight crime, reform welfare, restrict child pornography, reform product-liability laws, impose term limits on Congress and give the President veto power over individual items in spending bills. The chief budget-busters are proposed tax cuts that would greatly reduce Federal revenues and a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget.
The tax cuts -- on capital gains, families with children, corporate investment, retirement savings and Social Security benefits -- would cost, according to Republican estimates, about $40 billion a year for the first five years. Thereafter, because of tricky provisions, the costs would soar, probably doubling to $80 billion a year. The biggest hit would come from eliminating the deficit, which would require Congress to cut $140 billion a year from the budget. The contract would require knocking about $200 billion a year out of a $1.5 trillion budget.
This will be hard: the Republicans must pay interest on the Federal debt ($200 billion) and will not cut Social Security ($350 billion), defense ($280 billion), pensions ($70 billion) or most of Medicare ($200 billion). That leaves at most about $450 billion in other programs from which to find the $200 billion cut.
To put matters in perspective, Congress has yet to summon the courage to cut $3 billion a year to pay for the international trade accord. Representative John Kasich of Ohio, in line to lead the House Budget Committee, is one of the few to present an honest list of specific cuts. But even his list, which would take on every vested interest in Congress, amounts to about $35 billion a year -- only a fourth of the distance to the goal line set by the contract.
The contract would almost certainly require huge cuts in Federal spending on education, job training, student loans and mass transit. If Washington abandons these programs, many of which target the disadvantaged, governors of large states will be confronted with an ugly choice. Pete Wilson of California, William Weld of Massachusetts, George Pataki of New York and John Engler of Michigan could either stand aside and watch needy residents suffer -- or raise taxes. Mr. Pataki, of course, has pledged to cut taxes.
Senator Phil Gramm brushes the problem aside by proclaiming that Republicans are not rushing to eliminate worthy expenditures; instead they intend to switch spending decisions from Washington to families. The Republicans would, for example, reduce Federal housing and education programs while simultaneously reducing taxes on families with children, thus allowing the families to finance their own housing and education needs. What Mr. Gramm does not say is that his tax cuts would be spread widely but his spending cuts would pummel the needy.
If Republicans push their contract past President Clinton into law, they will have to find huge cuts in Medicaid, student loans, medical research and nearly every other Federal program. Some programs, like wasteful farm subsidies, deserve to be eliminated. But the cuts required by the contract would go beyond any reasonable definition of waste and fraud. Even those who voted for the contract may not be pleased by its punishing nature.

Eye Of Newt

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
With victory, would Newt Gingrich move from street fighter to statesman? It took only a few days to learn the answer: No.
As prospective Speaker of the House, he quickly wrote a letter to the present Speaker, Tom Foley, warning Democrats not to hide or destroy any official documents. Of course he did not think the famously honorable Mr. Foley was going to purloin documents. It was just a way to plant the idea of a Democratic conspiracy: a way to continue his war on the opposition. 
 Before the election he said President Clinton was "the enemy of normal Americans." Afterward, he explained that by "normal" he had meant "middle class." Sure.
Even some of his aides were shocked by his comment on the case of Susan Smith, the South Carolina woman charged with killing her two children. The way to prevent such horrors, Mr. Gingrich said, was to vote Republican.
In an interview soon after the Republican sweep he said President and Mrs. Clinton were "counterculture McGovern-niks." Yep, they wear beads and have opted out of ambition in our competitive world.
Slash and burn, knife and smear: The Gingrich instincts are unrelenting. Herblock got it right in his Washington Post cartoon when he had Mr. Gingrich crawling out of the same sewer where he portrayed Richard Nixon years ago.
It is hardly news that Newt Gingrich is not Mr. Nice Guy in politics. But his signals that he is going to stick to the Rottweiler game matter a lot. They give us a preview of what he is going to try to do with a Republican Congress.
There was a lot of talk about bipartisanship last week in Washington: working together for the good of the country and so on. But that has nothing to do with Mr. Gingrich. His object will be, in everything he does, to advance the cause of the Republican Party -- and himself.
His aim as Speaker, therefore, will be to churn out legislation that puts President Clinton in an embarrassing position. It is not hard to imagine some that would fulfill that purpose.
Welfare reform will be near the top of the list. President Clinton campaigned for reform and has proposed legislation designed to force recipients to work after a maximum of two years on the rolls. But Mr. Gingrich operates from a different premise.
Mr. Gingrich says that welfare, and some Great Society measures, have contributed to all kinds of social evils, in particular the rising rate of illegitimacy. (He ignores the fact that illegitimacy has risen sharply in Britain after many years of Conservative Governments.) He wants the children of poor mothers denied welfare to be put in orphanages.
In all likelihood, then, a Republican House will pass a far more stringent, indeed punitive version of welfare reform. If the Senate concurs, President Clinton will be confronted with a difficult choice. If he vetoes a mean-minded bill, Mr. Gingrich will surely relabel him the enemy of normal Americans.
Race is another area where we can expect a Gingrich demarche. Resentment of affirmative action on behalf of minorities and women in employment was apparently a significant factor in leading a high proportion of white men to vote Republican last week. A Republican Congress could well legislate against existing affirmative-action rules, perhaps even to the extent of intervening in cases now before the courts.
Then there is immigration. Pete Wilson's success in running against immigrants in California will surely tempt Republicans in Washington to offer draconian measures against illegal immigration -- and perhaps tighter limits on legal as well.
The basic Gingrich platform is economic, featuring massive tax cuts. But tax cuts are a complicated business, threatening higher deficits that would worry Wall Street. The advantage of the ideas for social legislation is that they play to the fears of the Gingrich constituency. They draw a line between Us and Them. Mr. Gingrich is an expert at the politics of division.
Is President Clinton ready to veto bills that would make this a more divided society? Will he take on the difficult job, the necessary job, of explaining that we all live in the same country and it will hurt us all to make some Americans poorer and more ignorant? Harry Truman had the courage to veto foolish anti-Communist bills at the height of the cold war. Will Bill Clinton have that kind of courage?

Transfer Of Power

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Bill Clinton remains President of the United States for foreign affairs, but the center of power in domestic affairs -- both in voting strength and intellectual energy -- has shifted from the White House to the putative Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich.
Our first elected half-term President has only himself, his wife and their political advisers to blame for this unprecedented power division. When Representative Gingrich sought to nationalize local elections by submitting a platform of clear, conservative promises, Mr. Clinton foolishly agreed to escalate the mid-term elections into a stark choice between Reaganism and Clintonism. 
 He publicized Gingrich's "Contract With America," warred happily against it on the campaign trail, nuked it by misleading the elderly into fearing for their Social Security, and laid his leadership on the line. As a result, as the Chinese say, he lost the Mandate of Heaven.
Keeper of the voters' mandate is now Gingrich. Since the election, the future-shocking history teacher from Georgia has been forthright, at times eloquent, in articulating his policy goals to a much wider audience. Counterproductively, he added a few ungracious and dated shots at the "counterculture" and media elite, which gave losers not still shell-shocked their chance to demonize him.
But consider why some of us think of him as Newt the Beaut. Not so long ago, our 435 House members were served by a staff of 3,000; today, aides and hangers-on have ballooned to 20,000, and are an integral part of the government-intrusion problem (the Congress makes regulations for idle hands). He has pledged to cut staff by one-third, and as Speaker, he will have the power to deliver; that example should induce the Senate to do the same.
He'll also deliver in the House on term limits and a balanced-budget amendment, too, along with the line-item veto that will give the President greater power to break up costly legislative package deals; we'll see how many Democrats join Senator Robert Byrd, prince of pork, to thwart the will of the people.
That element of Newt's First 100 Days will be aimed at restraining and disciplining the way Washington does political business. What about the way the Federal Government then helps the average family cope with modern social and economic life?
The trick, according to Newtonom-ics, is to let people keep more of what they earn to spend the way they want. But that's selfish, say liberals; what about compassion for the poor?
That takes us past the easy stuff, like health-insurance reform and tax fixes to encourage marriage and parents' support of children, to the hard part: welfare reform and -- want a new long word? -- disentitlementarianism.
The Clinton notion of welfare reform -- a make-work requirement after a couple of years -- is a far cry from what Representative Gingrich and Senator Phil Gramm have in mind. They can show how welfare to the able-bodied has bred dependency, and believe the only way to discourage unemployed single mothers from having more children is to make it unprofitable.
Does this mean we're going to let little kids starve to provide a disincentive? That's where Newt starts muttering about orphanages, as if the nation is going to allow Oliver Twisting in the wind. No; draconian threats may be needed to break the old patterns, but cooperation can find a way -- none dare call it compromise -- to quickly transform welfare to workfare.
Libertarian conservatives like me recoil at the intrusiveness in Newt's call for a "voluntary" school prayer amendment. He's being inconsistent on his bedrock principle of individual responsibility: If parents want to imbue their children with spiritual values -- as more should -- the parents should take the kids by the hand to Sunday School and not fob off that family duty on educators employed by local government.
But we don't have to agree with Newt down the line to admire the boldness of his futurism, the energy with which he mobilizes his forces and the joy he takes in upsetting the apple cart of power in the nation's capital.
The transfer is only temporary, of course. One of these days, a President will offer a competing vision of public support for personal freedom. Could even be Clinton; but for now, the Congress proposes and the Congress disposes.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTION: TENNESSEE;
A Disillusioned State Gives Up on Democrats

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MONTEAGLE, Tenn., Nov. 11

 BODY:
Sometimes it is the little things that lead to big changes.
Ask John Greeter, a lifelong Democrat who runs a building supply business in this town of 1,100 perched atop the mist-shrouded Cumberland Plateau and near the steep grade into the Sequatchie Valley that truckers, with air-braking and gear-grinding dread, call Monster Mountain. 
 Mr. Greeter, who is 59, counted himself a 30-year-long friend of Senator Jim Sasser. He had served on Senator Sasser's campaign finance committee for more than 15 years and as Democratic chairman of Grundy County in the early 1970's, when Mr. Sasser was rebuilding the state party, which he then headed, after Richard M. Nixon's Southern strategy had hurt it.
But Mr. Greeter said that at a reception in Tullahoma last February, he walked up to Mr. Sasser only to find the Senator abruptly turning his back on him, apparently not recognizing who he was.
"It sort of hurt my feelings, and I don't mind saying so," said Mr. Greeter, whose gruff tone could not hide his embarrassment at admitting such vulnerability.
"A lot of us average good ol' boys with bib overalls have been feeling like Jim Sasser has turned his back on us in other ways, too," Mr. Greeter said, ticking off a list that included cuts in military spending, gun control measures and what he called giveaway programs. "I think I had just been waiting for an excuse to look at other candidates, and that was it."
From the banks of the Mississippi River in the west to Lookout Mountain in the east, Tennesseans voted Republican in droves last Tuesday, ratifying an estrangement from Democratic incumbents that had been growing for months and perhaps years. In the minds of many voters, incumbent Democrats had forgotten about the little things -- the common-touch gestures that may have gotten them elected in the first place. And to these voters such neglect was only emblematic of a widening ideological divide between the lawmakers and their constituents.
The voters drove their displeasure home last week. Mr. Sasser, an 18-year incumbent who had been a strong candidate to lead his party in the Senate had he won, was turned out by Dr. William Frist, a little-known transplant surgeon with no political experience but $2 million of his own money to spend on his campaign. The race was not even close: Dr. Frist won with 56 percent of the vote, to Mr. Sasser's 42 percent.
The Republican sweep also included the victory of former Representative Don Sundquist over Mayor Phil Bredesen of Nashville in the race for governor. And in a race to fill the Senate seat vacated by Vice President Gore, Fred Thompson, a Washington lawyer and part-time actor, beat Representative Jim Cooper going away, 61 percent to 38 percent.
The departing Governor, Ned McWherter, a Democrat who was barred by law from seeking a third term, said signs of a restive state electorate were obvious in the 1992 Presidential election. Tennessee, a state that has long been dominated by Democrats and has had just four Republican governors in this century, gave Bill Clinton and its native son, Mr. Gore, a narrow 47 percent plurality. Mr. McWherter said those who did vote for Mr. Clinton believed he was a "new Democrat" who would trim big Government, cut taxes and reflect the moderate to conservative views of most in the state.
As for the 1994 election results, "I guess this means that they are still frustrated," the Governor said as he stood in the driveway of the Governor's mansion in Nashville.
The voters' call for change and new faces seemed more intense in Tennessee than elsewhere. While 37 percent of voters nationwide said electing all new people was the key to improving things, 50 percent of Tennesseans viewed that as the road to improvement, according to surveys of voters at polling places.
"All of the things that became obstacles for Democrats nationally reached their peak in Tennessee," said Geoffrey Garin of Garin-Hart Research, which did polling for Mr. Sasser's campaign.
Even the state's strong economy could not save the Democrats. Despite living in a state with the nation's fastest rate of income growth and unemployment down to about 5 percent, Tennesseans do not believe that the prosperity will last very long, Mr. Garin said.
The sweep at the top of the ticket helped propel Republican victories in two races for open seats in the House of Representatives.
In "an absolutely remarkable reversal of the dictum that all politics are local," Republicans were able to "nationalize" the election at the level of Congressional districts, said Charles Brockett, a political scientist at the University of the South in Sewanee, and make it a referendum on the ideological differences between the two parties.
Interviews with nearly two dozen voters across the state revealed a consensus that representatives had strayed and trusts had been betrayed. Such dissatisfaction with incumbents, and hence the Democrats who had been in power, cut deeply across socioeconomic groups and was evident in both men and women. Only blacks, who represent about 10 percent of the electorate in Tennessee, remained overwhelmingly supportive of Democrats.
For Mr. Sasser, the numbers tell the story. Six years ago Mr. Sasser won all but one of the state's 95 counties. This year he won only 24 counties.
Mr. Thompson's victory in the other Senate race this year was almost as sweeping as Mr. Sasser's victories had been in the past. And again it often seemed to be the little things that mattered and that highlighted the differences between the candidates. Consider 42-year-old Jan Crockett, a waitress at the Country Pride Restaurant and Truck Stop on the interstate at the edge of Nashville, who swears by handshakes -- strong ones -- which she said her father had taught her meant that a person was honest.
"Now Fred Thompson had a strong handshake," said Ms. Crockett, pausing in the midst of her banter with truckers. "It's the little things that people do that really matter. And you know, I never met Jim Cooper to shake his hand."
Frustration was the word that Don S. Moser, 34, of Murfreesboro, in central Tennessee, used to describe why he voted for Republicans this time around. Standing in his family-owned Bubba's Boots ("Kinda rolls off the tongue, don't it?" he said, smiling), Mr. Moser said that the "career politicians had to go" and "just being in Washington all these years" was a problem for many of the Democrats.
Even Dr. Frist, who is worth about $20 million, seemed closer to the middle Tennessee earth, Mr. Moser said.
"He's a clean-cut guy with a nice family," he said. "Yes, he's rich, but he understands us because he lives here with us."
Mr. Sasser was also a key player the last time Republicans were beneficiaries of an anti-incumbent mood, said Pat Nolan, a political analyst. Some 24 years ago, Mr. Sasser was the campaign manager for Vice President Gore's father, Senator Albert Gore Jr., when Senator Gore lost his bid for a fourth term to a Republican, William Brock.
John Greeter, the onetime Sasser supporter from Monteagle who felt snubbed by the Senator, remembers that race by Senator Gore as the first of several times he left the Democratic fold to vote Republican. He did return to the party as a county chairman to help Mr. Sasser rebuild the state party, and he helped Mr. Sasser unseat Mr. Brock six years later. But he said he will not go back again.
"The Republicans are the party of the people now," he said.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Little things like a candidate's firm handshake helped Jan Crockett decide whom to vote for last week. John Greeter says that an incident in which Senator Jim Sasser turned his back on him was symbolic. "Career politicians had to go," Don S. Moser said, summing up last week's triumph for Republicans.

HEADLINE: Trying New Ways to Save Decaying Parks

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
City and community leaders gathered in 1986 to break ground on the Underhill Playground in Prospect Heights in Brooklyn. A brass band played, children sang and Mayor Edward I. Koch proclaimed, "One million dollars is a lot of money and we'll be getting a lot of playground for our money."
Seven years after its completion, the playground is a wreck. Rubber swings were shredded by pit bulls being trained by neighborhood boys. Metal swings and slides were stolen. A spiraling plastic slide, the only remaining piece of play equipment, has a big hunk ripped out. There is broken glass, swirling graffiti, crack vials and, these days, few children. 
 The Underhill Playground's rapid decline is not unusual. Maintenance has become a critical problem in the city's 905 playgrounds and 479 parks, especially the small ones that fail to attract the private donations that glamour parks like Central Park do.
Since the economic slide of the late 1980's, the Parks Department operations budget has undergone wave after wave of cuts. Since 1990, its staff alone has been reduced by more than 45 percent, to 2,548 positions.
Faced with the city's fiscal squeeze, park advocates are debating a flurry of new ideas to change the way city parks have long been operated and financed. Many of the proposals put more responsibility in the private sector. They include turning maintenance duties over to contractors, a plan soon to be tested in two Queens communities; employing welfare recipients, and being more entrepreneurial with concessions.
"The city has in effect announced that is not going to take care of its parks," said Linda Davidoff, executive director of the Parks Council, an advocacy group. Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said further budget cuts would amount to "giving liposuction to a skeleton."
In apparent agreement, the Giuliani administration has proposed only a one percent cut in its latest belt-tightening measures, modest compared to the bigger slices for other city agencies.
Ideas for new financing sources call on the community. One bill, drafted by the Parks Department and the Central Park Conservancy and now under review, calls for special property-tax assessment districts around designated parks, particularly Central Park. These so-called park enhancement districts are patterned after the business improvement districts that have proliferated around the city.
The Parks Council has another idea: a citywide tax earmarked for parks, like systems that have succeeded in Chicago, Minneapolis and Los Angeles. New York ranks 20th among major cities in the proportion of the municipal budget for parks, less than half of one cent of every dollar -- a situation the council says a guaranteed tax would reverse.
 
Private Solutions And Public Space
 The proposals have set off a debate over the extent to which the city should resort to private solutions to safeguard public space; the extent to which past policy, relying on a large bureaucracy with an organized work force, has failed, and how well new initiatives address some of the system's fundamental problems.
When Robert Moses consolidated the city's huge system of parks and playgrounds in the 1930's, he specified that six attendants were needed for a properly functioning playground. Today, one worker visits a playground for an hour or two a day.
"When parks are unattended, they are targets," said Mr. Stern.
Yet the Parks Department keeps building things it knows it cannot maintain. This year's capital budget of $134.4 million is down just 8 percent from 1990, compared with a 21 percent drop in spending for operations this year, to $151.3 million.
Officials say the capital budget is more resistant to cuts, in part because just about everyone, from the Mayor to City Council members to borough presidents, can initiate capital parks projects. The financing system also tempts: with long-term bonds, payment is a concern of the distant future. And no one disputes major park renovations are needed.
Tupper W. Thomas, administrator of Prospect Park in Brooklyn, said this means that she has had to wait for a roof to collapse to replace it through a new capital expenditure, other than making repairs. "You keep doing things with capital money because you don't have enough in the expense budget," she said.
Richard Harary, an interior designer, was fed up with crack vials and unusable equipment in the playground near his apartment building at 49th Street and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. On spotting Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani at a Yankees game last summer, he passed him a note about efforts to improve the park.
The result was a call from the Manhattan Parks Commissioner, Patrick J. Pomposello, who said he had lined up funds from the City Parks Foundation, a nonprofit organization that raises money for neighborhood parks and playgrounds. The foundation would supply $20,000, provided Mr. Harary could raise the rest. Now he is only a few thousand short of buying a $40,000 jungle gym.
One catch: parks officials said neighbors must pay for maintenance themselves. Or they could do a full-scale renovation. Mr. Harary said community board members told him that he could get a $300,000 capital grant from the city without having to match funds. "We told them that is a waste of money and time," he said.
 
Citizen Groups And Self-Help
 Mr. Harary's experience illustrates how the city is stepping out of the maintenance process. There are now a half-dozen citizen organizations, from the Central Park Conservancy to the Prospect Park Alliance, that have helped the city's large, highly visible parks.
But there are few glitzy benefit parties for the hundreds of small parks and playgrounds falling apart throughout the city. What they do have, more and more, are scores of frustrated neighbors who are raking the leaves and picking up the litter themselves. Some, like Mill Brook Houses Playground in the Bronx, were restored by the city in recent years but have since fallen into disrepair and lack friends to help.
"I don't know how much the city will ever step back in," said Deborah Landau, executive director of the City Parks Foundation.
Bryant Park, the midtown park in Manhattan that was renovated three years ago, is often at the center of discussions about privatizing parks operation. Its upkeep comes from $250,000 a year in city funds, $300,000 from concessions and other park uses, and $950,000 raised from tax assessments on the owners of surrounding buildings. Bryant Park has about $200,000 to spend for each acre, compared with a citywide figure of $5,700 an acre.
The proposed park enhancement districts were envisioned by the Central Park Conservancy, which has raised $120 million from private donors over the last decade to restore the city's premier park. Property owners around the park -- how close has not been determined -- would be assessed a percentage of their real-estate taxes for park maintenance. After a review by the Corporation Counsel, the city's chief lawyer, and the Mayor's approval, the bill on creating the districts is to be introduced in the Legislature in January.
The bill also permits other parks to set up districts. "People who want their parks to be magic carpets can supplement the city's contribution," Mr. Stern said. "It's like upgrading an airline ticket to first-class."
Critics worry that the districts would create a two-tier system of parks. Some cite the experience of Minneapolis, which 25 years ago tried financing its parks with special assessments on residents living around particular parks. "It totally disenfranchised the folks who couldn't afford parks," said David Fisher, superintendent of the Minneapolis Parks and Recreation Board.
After less than a decade, Minneapolis resumed its earlier means of financing parks: a citywide charge on every property owner to be used for parks. That is the system the Parks Council favors in New York.
In a variation, Robert Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, has called for tolls to be reimposed on Westchester County parkways to finance all state and city parks in that region. "Parks are as important as bridges and tunnels," he said.
That alternative would be fine with Ira M. Millstein, chairman of the Conservancy. "I'm not trying to build an empire," he said. "Let the city take back its responsibility."
But some critics do not think the city can, pointing to its large, lumbering work force and bureaucracy. "A lot of people look at having only a money problem," said Daniel A. Biederman, executive director of the Bryant Park Improvement District. "The parks also have a management problem."
 
Ideas for Cutting Park Labor Costs
 In that regard, Mr. Stern is pursuing a multifront battle.
A first objective, Mr. Stern says, is to lower labor costs -- with health insurance and other job benefits, many park workers make $25 an hour. Mr. Stern hopes to tap the Mayor's plan to put to work recipients of Home Relief, a state welfare program for childless adults. The Parks Department has asked the city's Human Resources Administration for up to 5,000 welfare recipients for large-scale cleanups, and it wants to put the first of them to work beginning in January.
"Bringing in cheap labor isn't going to solve the problem," countered Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. "You need skilled workers."
"We can do it better and cheaper," he added, referring to two Queens park districts in which maintenance is being turned over to a private contractor.
The company, Reliable Cleaning Services of Westchester County, recently won a bidding contest to perform all park maintenance in Glendale and Middle Village. Union workers have 30 days to better the offer, which park officials say is $120,000 cheaper than the present cost. Even if the union offer is cheaper still, the city does not have to accept it.
The Mayor's office has also recently approved a new policy in which the Parks Department keeps concession revenues beyond a yet-to-be-determined base line. Fees from concessions -- hot-dog vending in playgrounds, concerts in Shea Stadium -- now go to a citywide kitty.
"If we beat the revenue base line, they will increase the budget by that amount," said Parks Deputy Commissioner Robert L. Garafola.
Not all favor such aggressiveness on concessions. "Even as it appears to succeed by generating substantial revenue," said Ms. Davidoff of the Parks Council, "it fails by creating a danger that more and more of each park's acreage will be taken over by commercial activity."
Bryant Park, the host to exclusive fashion shows every year, is often cited as public space being monopolized by private interests.
As park advocates and the city debate all these initiatives, the fear remains that they are largely untested -- and tardy. And the parks deteriorate, even as they are born anew.
In mid-October, at Owls Head Park in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, residents were ecstatic that the city was at last dedicating a new playground. But vandals ripped apart some new equipment just weeks before the official opening. "I give it a month before there's graffiti and broken glass everywhere," said Bob Quinn, a retired elevator mechanic whose son was 2 when the playground was first promised. He is now 17.
Two weeks earlier, Murphy's Brother's Playground on the Lower East Side was dedicated after a $582,000 makeover. But James Hayes, principal of the nearby Epiphany School, recalled what happened after a similar ribbon-cutting there in 1985: the park was taken over by homeless people and drug users, and ravaged by vandals.
"I find it ironic," he said. "We're back here doing it again."

HEADLINE: Clinton Promotes U.S.-North Korea Nuclear Agreement

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Tuesday, Nov. 15

 BODY:
In wide-ranging meetings with Asian and Pacific leaders, President Clinton sought on Monday to promote support for Washington's nuclear accord with North Korea and train the spotlight on America's more prominent role in the Asia-Pacific region.
But senior Administration officials acknowledged that the United States faces extraordinarily complicated negotiations with Japan, South Korea and other participants in carrying out the nuclear accord during the next decade, and even Mr. Clinton said that making it a reality would be difficult. 
 Reeling from last week's election that ushered in a Republican-dominated Congress, Mr. Clinton enjoyed on Monday the approbation and adulation that accompanies any gathering of world leaders.
He used meetings with fellow members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to try to regain his political footing and explain how crucial it was for Congress to pass GATT, the Global Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, before the end of the year.
"I told each of the leaders that I would do everything that I could to pass the GATT, that Congress would come back soon and that I thought it would pass," he told a news conference. "It was clear to me that the rest of the world is looking to the United States for leadership on this issue. It's also clear to me, I will say again, that it is very much in our interest to pass GATT because it means more high-paying jobs for Americans."
In Manila on Sunday and here on Monday, Mr. Clinton said that the impact overseas of the American elections was, if not minimal, at least manageable and that he alone steers foreign policy.
After the election, the Administration emphasized that harmony pervaded American foreign policy. But that position has since been refined, and Mr. Clinton and his aides have taken to giving their audiences a basic civics lesson, telling them about the extraordinary constitutional powers of the American President to make and execute foreign policy.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, speaking on CNN, said that Mr. Clinton's counterparts at the meeting understood that foreign policy is in the President's hands.
"These are all men in political life themselves," he said. "And they know about elections and about things going up and down. They understand that the President of the United States is our key foreign policy spokesman, that he has tremendous foreign policy powers."
President Kim Young Sam of South Korea offered his sympathy about the elections to Mr. Clinton, a senior Administration official said, talking about "some ups and downs" in his own political career and giving Mr. Clinton two words of advice: "Keep going."
Much of the focus of the meetings on Monday was on the accord that requires North Korea to freeze and ultimately dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for $4 billion in economic incentives. Japan and South Korea have agreed in principle to pay for most of the program, but a Japanese official said that Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama had told Mr. Clinton that the world's seven leading industrial nations and others "should cooperate in this North Korean program because weapons have a global dimension."
Both Japanese and South Korean officials said on Monday that their respective governments are not ready to make a firm financial commitment.
Asked at his news conference whether he expected specific commitments, Mr. Clinton sidestepped the issue, saying, "Well, they all said that they strongly supported the agreement and that they thought it was very important that we continue to work it through."
He acknowledged the land mines that could lie ahead, adding, "They understood that the implementation of the agreement would not be without difficulty and it would require a lot of efforts on several fronts."
The United States, South Korea and Japan met on Monday night to discuss the accord and said afterward that carrying it out was "of the utmost importance."
In a meeting on Monday, China's President, Jiang Zemin, told Mr. Clinton that China "welcomed strongly" the American agreement with North Korea to halt North Korea's nascent nuclear program.
The two men also discussed weapons proliferation issues. Mr. Clinton said he welcomed an agreement reached last month in which the United States lifted the 1993 ban on the export of high-technology satellites to China in return for a new Chinese pledge to continue to make more progress toward complying fully with the accord.
 The United States has asked China to disclose its past exports of M-11 missile technology to Pakistan. The United States would be willing to waive economic sanctions required by law in exchange for a Chinese admission that it had exported complete M-11 missile systems.
Despite Mr. Clinton's insistence that human rights are important to his foreign policy agenda with both China and Indonesia, the issue has dramatically receded since the last APEC summit in Seattle.
Since the Clinton Administration disentangled trade benefits from progress in human rights, it has also discarded a strategy that set specific human rights goals for China. In his meeting with Mr. Jiang, Mr. Clinton restated Administration policy, telling him that the relationship between the countries would not flourish unless they improved their human rights record.
The Chinese leader told Mr. Clinton that China "attaches great importance to human rights," a spokesman, Chen Jian, told reporters. But he repeated China's position that the country's higher priority was political stability, because otherwise China's economic revolution would stall, people would go hungry and the most basic human right would be lost.

HEADLINE: U.N. Council Decides to Keep Economic Sanctions on Iraq

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 14

 BODY:
The Security Council maintained its economic sanctions against Iraq today after the United States provided evidence that President Saddam Hussein was spending lavishly on his own comforts while millions of Iraqis lacked food and medicine.
The United States representative, Madeleine K. Albright, told the Council that while "living standards for most Iraqis have fallen," the Iraqi leader has spent more than $500 million on "dozens of opulent new palaces for the exclusive use of his family." 
 After her private briefing, which included a dozen spy-satellite photos and maps, Sir David Hannay, the British delegate, said the scale of the projects was "quite startling" and "pretty impressive, frankly."
"These were no farmhouses or little cottages," Sir David said. They are "a great deal closer to the scale of Versailles," he added, and have escaped notice because they are in areas barred to foreigners.
The continuation of the sanctions, chiefly on the sale of Iraqi oil abroad, came only two hours after the Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, arrived here.
Mr. Aziz formally turned over to Ms. Albright, in her role as president of the Council for November, documents that certified Iraq's recognition of Kuwaiti sovereignty, as had been demanded in a Council resolution. The Iraq-Kuwait border was defined after a United Nations survey.
In the four years since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the Council has adopted 28 resolutions, including one calling upon Iraq to acknowledge the independence of Kuwait and recognize the border. The others are aimed at ending attacks on Iraqi minorities, scrapping weapons of mass destruction and accounting for missing Kuwait citizens.
Speaking as president of the Council, Ms. Albright said of today's action that "we met, reviewed the sanctions regime and decided to continue it without change."
The meeting between Ms. Albright and Mr. Aziz was described by aides as cool. Her associates said she wore a brooch in the shape of a snake as a memento of a poem printed last month in the Baghdad newspaper Al Iraq that likened her to a reptile.
Mr. Aziz told reporters, "The Council has imposed sanctions on Iraq for certain reasons and those reasons do not exist any more."
But Ms. Albright, speaking for the United States, said recognition of Kuwait by itself was insufficient to warrant lifting the sanctions, especially in view of Iraq's troop movements along the border last month. Almost as an aside, she told the Council that the troop movements had included deployment of about 200 armored personnel carriers that Iraq had captured from Kuwait.
Several members of the Council applauded Iraq's decision to recognize Kuwait. Li Zhaoxing, the representative of China, termed the action "a positive step." It was even described as "a step in the right direction" by a Kuwaiti diplomat, the Deputy Prime Minister, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah.
In a second Council meeting late today, the members began discussions about what response if any they would make to Iraq's recognition of Kuwait. It is probable that the Council will notify Baghdad that while it welcomed the move, it did not go far enough to permit lifting sanctions.
But the Russian delegate, Sergei Lavrov, described Iraq's move, which Moscow helped to engineer, as "an important step in implementing those resolutions and achieving comprehensive stability" in the area.
As for the descriptions of President Hussein's construction program, Mr. Lavrov said dryly, "Building palaces was not described in any Security Council resolutions in relation to sanctions."
Today's reports about the construction were slightly at variance with an account by Administration officials on Sunday, which said the building and renovation costs could have been as high as $1 billion. United States diplomats here said the apparent discrepancy might have arisen because this morning's account included several buildings that are used by the Government.
United States diplomats noted that the United Nations has allowed Iraq to sell up to $1.6 billion worth of oil to pay for food and medicine, and that Bagghad has failed to do so. Iraq's view is that the restrictions on such sales constitute foreign interference in internal affairs.

Apple's PC's Top Shipments

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Nov. 14

 BODY:
Apple Computer Inc. topped the Compaq Computer Corporation for third-quarter shipments of personal computers in the United States, the global market research company Dataquest Inc. said today.
Apple shipped more than 600,000 PC's, the most in what Dataquest said was the largest quarter ever for the United States PC market. Apple's Power Mac, representing 25 percent of Apple's total shipping volume, is on pace to surpass the company's projected shipment of one million units by March.
"Obviously, the pent-up demand for high performance on the Macintosh platform is greater than even Apple expected," Philippe de Marcillac of Dataquest said. 
 While Compaq fell behind Apple by about 30,000 PC shipments for the quarter, Compaq still leads in year-to-date shipments with more than 13 percent of the market, compared with Apple's share of nearly 12 percent.
Dataquest said the United States PC market has grown 34 percent over the corresponding quarter a year ago, as vendors have stocked up with high hopes for holiday season demand as well as steady business demand.

HEADLINE: Solar Power, for Earthly Prices

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Nov. 14

 BODY:
The nation's largest natural gas company is betting $150 million that it can succeed where the Government has so far failed: producing solar power at rates competitive with those of energy generated from oil, gas and coal.
The Enron Corporation plans to build a plant in the southern Nevada desert that would be the largest operation in the country making electricity directly from sunlight, producing enough to power a city of 100,000 people. It is expected to begin operating in late 1996. 
 Grand promises in the late 1970's about the potential of virtually pollution-free, endlessly renewable energy sources like solar energy faded into an embarrassed hush. But several of the nation's leading solar power experts say Enron's optimistic goal is probably reachable.
The reason is that during the last decade, the cost of solar power generation has quietly declined by two-thirds. Far from depending on some wondrous breakthrough, the experts say, Enron can offer commercially competitive solar power by inexpensively mass-producing solar panels, and then employing thousands of them in the Nevada desert.
Even the most optimistic supporters of solar power have doubted that they would see commercially competitive production until the next century. The Worldwatch Institute, an environmental group in Washington, said earlier this year that solar cell electricity, now as low as 20 cents a kilowatt-hour, might reach 10 cents by 2000 and 4 cents by 2020.
Yet Enron is pledging to deliver the electricity at 5.5 cents a kilowatt- hour in about two years. That would beat the average cost of 5.8 cents currently paid by the Government for the electricity it uses. The national average retail price is 8 cents.
Several legal and political obstacles remain, and for competitive reasons Enron will describe its technology only in general terms. But solar energy researchers who had consulted with Enron were willing to elaborate on the available technology and the financial calculus.
Enron's 100-megawatt plant would be more than a dozen times the size of any other that employs photovoltaic, or solar power, cells, which use the energy in sunlight to shake electrons loose from molecules of silicon or other substances. Size is key, according to Sigurd Wagner, a professor of electrical engineering at Princeton University.
"If a good group of people puts a plant of that scale in, it will have a real consequence on costs," he said. "It's not going to go down by just a little bit, but by a factor of two."
To reduce the price further, the company is counting on available tax breaks and inexpensive financing.
As for whether Enron's goals are realistic, Professor Wagner said, "They're pushing it, but they're not far off."
The company, based in Houston, has already won preliminary backing from the Department of Energy, which tentatively plans to buy Enron's solar power as long as the rate is truly competitive with the power from conventional sources.
"I'm confident we can make some commitment for a Federal entity to purchase or at least broker some purchase of solar power," said William H. White, the Deputy Secretary of Energy.
Government officials say Enron's success will encourage the spread of solar power generation here and abroad.
"If they can do this, they're going to have lots of business," said Tony Catalano, director of the Energy Department's photovoltaic division. "This is going to be very competitive in the U.S. and lots of other places in the world."
Enron has asked the Government to buy or guarantee a market for its power, with annual increases of 3 percent, for 30 years. It also depends on leasing Government land, receiving Federal tax benefits for renewable energy and financing construction with tax-free industrial development bonds.
Mr. White proposes having the department's Western Area Power Administration, whose grid connects Hoover Dam and other projects with large public power authorities, buy the power generated by the solar plant. That power would only be available in daylight hours, which are also the hours of peak demand, especially for air-conditioning.
Previous efforts to promote solar power as a clean alternative to fossil fuels have foundered, despite the Government's spending of hundreds of millions of dollars on solar research. Solar power has remained too expensive, while fossil fuel prices have declined.
While solar cells can economically provide the tiny charges needed by watches and pocket calculators, their larger applications are mostly in remote places beyond the reach of the world's power grids.
Federal officials, aware that solar power breakthroughs have shined and faded almost as often as the sun, say the Enron project could introduce commercially competitive technology without expensive Government aid.
"This establishes the benchmark we want and restarts a stalled solar industry,' said Robert H. Annan, the solar energy director in the Department of Energy.
In fact, the solar industry has already grown, with the shipments of solar cells up more than tenfold since 1980, as repeated technological advances have lowered their cost.
Even after Federal officials agree to buy solar power, they will have to formally solicit bids to see if anyone can beat Enron's offer. Among more than 30 informal proposals so far, no one has.
Enron's chief strategy officer, Robert C. Kelly, says that producing solar power follows from Enron's generation of electricity from natural gas, a cleaner fuel than coal or oil. But Enron will not be running a charity. Asked how soon solar power could generate earnings, he said: "Now. We're a very impatient company in terms of profits."
Limited production of solar power cells at an adjacent factory, to be run by a partner whom Mr. Kelly would not identify, will keep the $150 million power plant from reaching its full capacity for about a decade.
The necessary technology is on display in Mr. Kelly's office, where a square glass panel about the size of an art book, its surface shimmering with metallic greens, blues and violets, rests on a gleaming steel rack. He is cautious about saying anything more than that the panel was produced by another company and used what people in the business called a thin-film design.
Silicon has been the film of choice, but several companies are achieving much higher efficiencies, and lower costs, with other substances or more than one silicon layer. A partnership between Energy Conversion Devices Inc. of Troy, Mich., and the Canon electronics company of Japan plans to open the world's largest thin-film solar cell plant in Newport News, Va., next year. Their cells will have two layers of silicon and one of germanium. The Enron and Canon ventures together would double the nation's output of solar cells.
Zoltan J. Kiss, the founder of Energy Photovoltaics Inc. of Princeton, N.J., said he had been negotiating with Enron about the production of copper indium diselenide cells, which he said had triple the efficiency of single-layer silicon cells.
Enron, which has built one of the world's largest gas-fired power plants in Britain, says it can also realize economies in the rest of the solar power plant's design.
Paul Maycock, a leading solar energy consultant, said a few of the solar cell technologies he had evaluated for Enron could achieve the company's goals, but only with sufficient production.
"Yes, it can be done," he said. "It's the dream we've all had: that someone would take the risk of building a very large factory."

HEADLINE: Fed Move to Raise Rates Expected Today

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Despite the likelihood of unusually strong public criticism, the Federal Reserve appears poised to raise short-term interest rates on Tuesday for the sixth time this year.
An eclectic chorus of critics, ranging from manufacturers to labor unionists, has begun to assail the central bank for going too far, saying it should wait to determine the effect of its previous rate increases. 
 The A.F.L.-C.I.O. and half a dozen community groups have scheduled a demonstration outside the Fed's headquarters on Tuesday to oppose any further increase in rates. It would be the first such rally since the early 1980's, when farmers angry about rising interest rates blocked the street outside the Fed with tractors and a group of demonstrators from Baltimore entered the building and ran through the halls.
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told Reuters that he hoped the Fed would proceed cautiously and not overdo its anti-inflation campaign. Slower growth is acceptable, he said, but be "sure you just slow it moderately."
Top Fed officials defend their interest-rate policy as necessary to prolong the current expansion by preventing an overheating of the economy. Growth that is too rapid could produce bottlenecks in factories and other businesses, feeding inflation as companies bid up the prices of scarce materials and skilled workers, they contend.
Edward W. Kelley Jr., a Federal Reserve Board governor, said that if the economy "starts to get frothy and starts growing too quickly, that will be the beginning of the end."
But in deciding the exact timing of further interest-rate increases, Fed officials are encountering two conflicting pressures.
One pressure comes from bond traders and investors, who want higher short-term interest rates that will brake inflation, which erodes the value of long-term investments like bonds. If the Fed does not raise short-term interest rates, they fear that long-term rates may rise further on inflation fears, choking off spending on new factories and other long-term productive investments.
At the same time, some economists and other critics have begun calling for the Fed to wait and see how much its previous rate increases will slow the economy -- a process that can take up to 18 months -- before proceeding with any more increases.
The evidence from recent economic statistics has been contradictory. The housing industry has begun to slow while producer prices have fallen for the last two months. But unemployment is falling, wages and retail sales are rising and factories are operating ever closer to full capacity, with new figures due on Tuesday morning.

TV assets help Belo shine in dull times for newspaper stocks.

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson 

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
YOU don't hear much buzz these days at the A. H. Belo Corporation, the newspaper and broadcasting company in Dallas, about the latest multimedia gizmo or the information superhighway. Being a couple of hours' flying time away from both coasts seems to help.
Instead, executives at the company are reveling in their good fortune, as the bidding frenzy for television stations and a wave of political advertising have helped push Belo's stock this month to its highest price, $55.125. And there still may be more where that came from. 
 The prices that networks are willing to pay for affiliates soared after the Fox Network lured eight stations away from CBS in May. That could not have been better timed for Belo, which has been pressing its diversification away from its flagship Dallas Morning News and into broadcasting. This year it bought a television station in New Orleans and agreed to buy another in Seattle, to go with its five other stations in Texas, California, Virginia and Oklahoma.
As a result, Belo now has the heft to extract sweet deals from networks. In August, it announced a 10-year affiliation agreement with Capital Cities/ABC that calls for substantially higher, though unspecified payments.
The full payoff of the new agreement will not come until next year, when the Sacramento, Calif., station switches to ABC from CBS. By then, the benefits of the Seattle purchase should also emerge.
Already, a strong quarterly earnings report has helped push the price of Belo's stock to the mid-50's, from the 48 range. Not bad, when newspaper stocks are down about 10 percent and the big broadcasters are mixed. Among Belo's fans is Michael F. Price, whose mutual fund management firm, as of its September report, owned more than 5 percent of the publicly traded shares.
Shares of Belo rose 25 cents, to $54.50, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
Belo's price-earnings ratio of almost 19 is already more in line with what Wall Street awards to broadcasters rather than newspaper chains. But analysts say the stock is still reasonable compared with anticipated 1995 earnings.
"The earnings outlook has improved substantially," said John Reidy of Smith Barney. "Good management, good properties and the change in affiliation payments."
The newspaper is not doing badly, either. While afflicted by the same circulation declines that have hurt other metropolitan dailies, The Morning News has been helped by a lively Dallas economy that has made the weekday paper as hefty as many Sunday papers elsewhere.
And Belo has not entirely forsaken the electronic future. It has joined several other medium-sized media chains in a modest research consortium -- Partners Affliated for Exploring Technology -- known as Pafet.
Belo still faces a few risks. Not even the slick layout editors who turn out the Fashion Dallas section could dress up a balance sheet where long-term debt and shareholders' equity stand virtually equal, at about $355 million. That is before the $160 million cash expense of the Seattle purchase.
Belo, however, pointing to a stock market value of more than $1 billion, insists that it could finance acquisitions, if necessary, by pumping out more stock, having bought back $32 million of it early this year.
The other risk remains the company's dependence on the oil patch. But the economy in Texas and the Southwest is becoming increasingly diversified, helping it prosper through a spell of moderate or weak energy prices.
It has been a particularly good season to own television stations in California and Texas. Both states had high-spending political races, including George W. Bush vs. Gov. Ann Richards in Texas and Michael Huffington vs. Senator Dianne Feinstein in California. In a year when lots of voters may have wanted everyone running for public office to lose, Belo is a likely winner.

HEADLINE: Rising Dollar Helps Dow Post Gain of 28.26

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
One day ahead of an important meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers, the stock market rallied yesterday, buoyed by a rising dollar that also lifted bond prices.
But the factors supporting the dollar, like the vote in Sweden to join the European Union, may be short term and thus stock and bond prices could fall later in the week, analysts say. 
 Nonetheless, more and more traders are looking to the Fed to raise interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, which would be a striking anti-inflation move. That could lead to a strong and sustained rally in the dollar, bonds and stocks, analysts say.
"You're looking at a currency market that likes decisive measures, like the Republican victory in the elections," said David De Rosa, a foreign-exchange trader at the Swiss Bank Corporation. "Inflation is tough. It's like a river of molasses. It takes a long time to get going and a long time to stop."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 28.26 points, to 3,829.73, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 3.69 points, to 466.04. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 6.02 points, to 768.14.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was below normal with 260.6 million shares changing hands, about 10 percent below this year's daily average of 289 million shares.
The stock market was almost evenly divided. Six stocks rose for every five that fell, with 1,258 issues advancing and 1,015 declining on the New York Stock Exchange.
In the credit markets, interest rates dropped. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 8.07 percent from 8.14.
Foreigners are buying dollars ahead of the Federal Reserve's expected move to raise short-term interest rates this week, possibly right after this afternoon's meeting of the policy-making panel. When a central bank raises interest rates, the higher return attracts foreign buyers to the nation's currency, stocks and bonds.
Several stocks were up sharply yesterday. Chrysler rose 3 1/8, to 49, after its largest shareholder, Kirk Kerkorian, said he planned to buy more shares. The Chiron Corporation, which said on Friday that it was in talks with another company about an alliance, rose 2 3/4, to 74 1/4. Powersoft established a new 52-week high of 73 1/4, before closing with a gain of 7 7/8, to 69 1/4, after Sybase agreed to buy Powersoft, a computer software company.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.59 points, to 254.84, and the American Stock Exchange market-value index rose 0.68 point, to 448.72.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Surge On Advances By the Dollar

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities surged yesterday on a strong dollar and gains in the futures market after an initial opening dip. Traders were waiting for the meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee today, with some adjusting of positions ahead of what many in the market expect will be the sixth increase in short-term interest rates by the Fed this year.
The cash market, which was closed on Friday in observance of Veterans Day, opened for trading yesterday and immediately followed the downward pattern of the futures market on Friday. But as the dollar turned higher against other foreign currencies, particularly the German mark and Japanese yen, bond prices began to make some solid gains. 
 Speculators that had been betting that prices would dip further were force to scramble and reverse those bets to cover short positions. Short- covering occurs when speculators sell borrowed securities in hope of buying them back at a lower price and pocketing the difference.
The rise in the prices was a bit of surprise to those who traded bond futures on Friday. Treasury bonds for December delivery traded as low as 92 2/32 on Friday, which implied a price of 92 11/32 in the cash market for a yield of 8.19 percent. Instead, the bond traded only as low as 92 14/32 in overnight trading in the Tokyo market, which meant the drop in bond futures on Friday did not carry over into the cash market.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 26/32 of a point yesterday, to 93 19/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 8.07 percent, from 8.14 percent on Thursday.
At the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three-month and six-months bills yesterday, rates increased modestly to their highest levels in three years. The average rate on a three-month issue was 5.29 percent, up 4 basis points from last week. The average for the six-month issue was 5.72 percent, also up 4 basis points from last week. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Matthew F. Alexy, a Government trading strategist for CS First Boston, said that while the gains in bond prices in the afternoon were strong, "it was actually the gains in the futures market that were more impressive, trading up 30 to 35 ticks on the long bond in response to the bashing on Thursday and Friday." A tick is a thirty-second of a percentage point.
The Fed, after today's meeting of its policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, is expected to raise the discount rate -- the rate the Fed charges member banks -- and the Federal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge each other for loans, usually overnight loans, by half a percentage point each. But Mr. Alexy said that while he expected an increase of half a percentage point in the Federal funds rate, he expected an increase of a full point in the discount rate. "For one, this would highlight the Fed's resolve in fighting inflation, and two, send a clear message to the foreign exchange market," he added.
Bonds have rallied three times out of the five times the Fed has raised interest rates this year. But even, so the analysts say, any rally after a rate increase today will probably not last long. There is still not enough evidence to convince the bond market that the economy has weakened to the point where a pickup in inflation is no longer a danger and that the Fed can stop raising rates as a result.
In addition to today's meeting, the Fed will release its report on October industrial production and capacity utilization, and the Commerce Department will report on October retail sales.
Elsewhere, municipal bond prices fell yesterday amid a supply of new issues and continued selling by money managers and securities dealers.
This week states, cities and agencies are scheduled to sell $4.6 billion, up from $2.3 billion last week. If the Fed fails to increase short-term interest rates by a half a point, some investors and traders expect some of this week's offerings to be pulled from the calendar because of the uncertainty about the direction of rates.
Yesterday, the Regional Transportation Authority of Illinois sold about $192 million in general obligation bonds in a negotiated offering through Bear, Stearns & Company. The bonds were initially priced to yield a maximum 7.28 percent for an issue due in 2025.
The bond issue consisted to two series of bonds, with each series insured by the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company and rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rallies Against Mark Following Vote in Sweden

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied against the German mark yesterday, buoyed by heavy sales of marks following a Swedish vote in favor of joining the European Union. The dollar was also aided by expectations of increases in short-term American interest rates.
On Sunday, Swedes narrowly approved their country's membership in the European Union next year in a nonbinding referendum. That prompted investors to sell marks they had bought amid concerns the proposal would not pass. 
 "There were mark sales after the Swedish referendum," said Robert White, senior vice president at Standard Chartered Bank.
The selloff of marks benefited the dollar, because in buying Swedish kronor for marks, many traders bought dollars for marks then sold the dollars for kronor.
The dollar rose as high as 1.5462 marks before settling at 1.5438 marks in New York trading, up from 1.5305 marks on Friday. The dollar was quoted at 7.3035 kronor to the dollar, up from 7.2437 kronor to the dollar on Friday.
The gains by the dollar against the mark helped to pull it higher against the Japanese yen. The dollar rose to 98.29 yen, from 97.73 yen on Friday.
The dollar was also helped by expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates today for the sixth time this year. An increase could aid the dollar by raising returns on some securities denominated in the currency.
Comments by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen also bolstered the dollar yesterday, but the impact was relatively short-lived. Mr. Bentsen said he was pleased with the United States intervention in the foreign-exchange markets two weeks ago and that Washington would be willing to act again.
When the Federal Reserve Bank of New York stepped in to prop up the value of the dollar by buying an estimated $2 billion of marks and yen, it did so after comments from Mr. Bentsen, whose department authorizes currency interventions.
David Durst, vice president at Bear, Stearns & Company, said traders rushed to buy dollars in case the Fed came into the market. Activity calmed down when there was no immediate intervention.
"Anything that is being perceived as a potential precursor to Fed intervention is prompting a little buying," Mr. Durst said.
In other currency trading, the Mexican peso fell to a new low against the dollar, trading at 3.4512 pesos to the dollar, from 3.443 pesos on Friday. The peso has fallen 11.1 percent so far this year.

HEADLINE: Role Shifts For Central Bankers

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
For the world's central bankers, the stage these days may be smaller, but their role has become bigger.
In the 1980's, when Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Karl Otto Pohl of the Bundesbank in Germany stepped onto the world stage, central bankers starred in the drive to curb global inflation, sharing top billing with the finance ministers of the seven largest industrial nations in moving currency rates up and down to cope with trade imbalances. 
 Today, their successors are playing to smaller crowds, limited primarily to the domestic scene. They have largely abandoned efforts to act in unison or fix exchange rates, particularly after the ignominious collapse of the European Monetary System two years ago.
Within that narrower drama, however, the central bankers' anti-inflation cause -- bolstered by the growing power of traders in the free-swinging capital markets to call the tune -- has taken over center stage.
Indeed, today's meeting of the Fed's monetary policy committee is expected to produce an interest-rate increase motivated more by bond traders' demands for a show of Fed resolve to fight inflation than by any strong indications that prices are about to rise. [Page D24.]
Central banks still intervene in currency markets occasionally, as the Federal Reserve did recently when it bought dollars to stem the decline of the dollar against the Japanese yen and German mark. But there has been no repeat of the Plaza Hotel agreement of 1985, when the United States and its major trading partners united to drive down the dollar. Nor has there been the kind of concerted intervention that took place two years later under the agreement reached at the Louvre in Paris to halt the dollar's slide.
"There has been nothing comparable to the Plaza-Louvre agreements -- probably because governments' hearts aren't in it any more," Mr. Volcker said. "They are reluctant to set exchange-rate targets these days."
In contrast to their waning sway over international currency movements, central bankers are gaining more authority domestically. Elected politicians, struggling everywhere to curb public spending and no longer sure that cheap credit creates jobs and popularity, are increasingly granting their central bankers the stature and independence they need to fight inflation.
A growing number of countries, emulating the stricter German and American models, have given their central banks more leeway to set interest rates on their own. But even as central bankers are eclipsing politicians in setting economic policies, they are finding their own starring roles circumscribed by legions of private investors who hold the reins in today's capital markets.
"Central banks are becoming more independent because that is the best assurance they will follow a stable noninflationary monetary policy," William J. McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, said in an interview.
Moreover, Mr. McDonough contended, a stable domestic policy should also pay dividends internationally. "Low inflation is the best assurance of exchange rate stability," he said.
Apart from keeping inflation low, central bankers acknowledge there is little they can do to impose stability on floating currencies. This was aptly illustrated at last month's annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Madrid. Officials there declared that misaligned and volatile exchange rates inflicted significant damage on a nation's economy. But when C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, suggested that central banks act to enhance stability by setting official exchange-rate "target zones" and intervening to defend them, he got little support.
Indeed, Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, said that the power of global traders to move markets "sets limits to formalizing exchange rates."
Except for the United States, Germany and Switzerland, most countries have long given elected officials, rather than the central bank, the power to set interest rates directly. This has tempted politicians to manipulate monetary policy. "Central banks under the direct control of governments seem inevitably to be tempted to promote easy-credit policies, particularly when elections are near," Mr. McDonough warns.
In the last few years, however, more countries have chosen to make central banks more independent. New Zealand decided in 1990 to set a low inflation target and make the central bank responsible for achieving it. Canada followed suit the next year. The results were striking.
New Zealand's inflation rate tumbled from 8.9 percent in 1989 to an expected 1.1 percent this year, well within its target range of 0 to 2 percent. Canada's rate fell to two-tenths of 1 percent in the year ended in August from 5.6 percent in 1991, also well under the 2.5 percent target set for mid-1994.
"We decided the best way to achieve all the goals in our charter was to concentrate on monetary stability," John W. Crow, former governor of the Bank of Canada, said. That stance, which contributed to a long recession, was far from universally popular in Canada, though. Mr. Crow was removed from office when the Liberals took power last year.
Britain remains a key exception to this trend. Its Conservative Government refuses to give full independence to the Bank of England, saying that the final word on monetary policy should be Parliament's.
In Latin America, countries that have moved to give their central banks greater independence include Venezuela, Mexico, Argentina and Chile. Also, South Africa's new racially mixed Government has agreed to an independent central bank.
Nigel Lawson, a Chancellor of the Exchequer under Margaret Thatcher of Britain, says governments weaken their anti-inflationary credentials by controlling monetary policy themselves. "I think the markets are going to feel there is something sinister about any government that does not confer independence on its central bank," he said.
Academic research also suggests that independent central banks preside over lower rates of inflation. In 1993, Alberto Alesina of Harvard University and Lawrence H. Summers, now the senior international official at the Treasury Department, showed that Germany and Switzerland, which have the most independent central banks, also had the best record on inflation. The United States, the Netherlands, Canada and Japan are close behind.
A third group of countries -- including France, Norway, Sweden, Britain, Italy and Spain -- have more politically subservient central banks and poorer inflation records.
This theory, however, was recently undercut somewhat by Adam Posen, another Harvard economist. Compared with the United States, he argued, the German and Swiss central banks do better at fighting inflation not so much because they are more independent as because they operate in societies intrinsically less tolerant of inflation.
Simply granting more independence to central bankers, therefore, may not necessarily lead to lower inflation, particularly when so many interest groups that normally would be allies of central banks believe they have little to gain from more stable prices and currencies.
Bankers "have learned to make money out of instability," complained Helmut Schlesinger, a former Bundesbank president.
Similarly, "industry ought to be a lobby against inflation," Mr. Volcker said, "but it is disorganized."

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL;
For the Big Dog, Big Time Means Big Pressure

BYLINE: By JENNIFER FREY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE

 BODY:
They are Boy Scout troop leaders and advisers and they have come from all over the state of Wisconsin to discuss the future of their organization. For the moment, though, there are more pressing things taking place on the gym floor one story below. Faces pressed against the glass, eyes straining downward, they are watching a tall, lanky young man challenge a player more than 10 years his senior to a simple game of H-O-R-S-E.
Legs crossed, back to the net, one hand on his neck, the ball in his right hand, the young man easily makes the basket from just inside the three-point line. The spectators grin. 
 The player's name is Glenn Robinson, but when word of his presence spreads through the Archbishop Cousins Center, it is his nickname that they use.
"It's the Big Dog," they whisper. "He's practicing in the gym."
Wisconsin natives have waited, both anxiously and patiently, for the arrival of Robinson, a gifted ballplayer who was taken first in last June's National Basketball Association draft by the Milwaukee Bucks. Hailed as the future savior of a franchise on the decline, Robinson held out for a contract of epic proportions -- at one point, his agent reportedly requested what would have been the first $100 million deal in any pro sport -- and he eventually signed a multiyear deal for $68.1 million just moments before the tipoff on the Bucks' opening night.
His arrival here in Milwaukee, then, has caused nothing short of a sensation. The locals hope he will return the Bucks to the prominence they held when another former first-round pick, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1969), led the team. And the league is so eager to see Robinson become one of the standout players it needs in the post-Magic-Bird-Jordan era that Commissioner David Stern nudged both sides when contract negotiations were stalled.
The pressure on Robinson, then, is nothing short of tremendous.
"I think it's a combination of everything," Robinson said, when asked what has been the most difficult adjustment. "The media is a little bit more pushy. The fans are a little bit more pushy because they want you to get out there and win. The players in the league -- everybody's very good, very strong. You just have to know how to deal with all of it.
"People say there's pressure on me here, but I've been facing pressure my whole life."
Robinson grew up in Gary, Ind., with his mother, Christine Bridgeman, who gave birth to her only son when she was a teen-ager. His father, Glenn Robinson Sr., also lives in Gary; Glenn Jr. does not like to talk about his father, and is guarded when asked about his childhood friends and family members.
He is not hesitant, though, to defend Gary, a city with high rates in both crime and unemployment. The citizens of Gary see Robinson as a point of pride and a great shining hope, much the same way Milwaukee natives believe he will resuscitate the ailing Bucks.
"I think I need to do things for my city," said Robinson, who was honored with a Glenn Robinson Day in Gary last August. "I just don't know exactly what yet."
And league observers don't quite know what to make of Robinson yet, not this early in his pro career. Certainly, he has the talent potential, the contract and the nickname -- as well as a major endorsement deal pending with Nike -- that accompany the typical N.B.A. superstar, but it remains to be seen how he will fare both on and off the court.
Set back by his absence from training camp, he is already is playing catchup to fellow rookies Grant Hill of Detroit and Jason Kidd of Dallas, who have started their seasons with strong performances. And, off the court, his reaction to the news media and the public spotlight is more along the lines of a Patrick Ewing -- who limits the news media's access to him and is extremely guarded about his personal life -- than the league's reigning personalities, Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal.
"I think it's better to be here," said Robinson, who is wary of what he has called "crazy stories" in the news media and prefers small-market Milwaukee for that reason, among others. "Here, it's not too fast, not too slow. There's not too much to do but what I'm here to do."
For the most part, Robinson just wants to be with his new teammates, who call him "rook" and make him pick up the balls after practice as they would any other rookie. Outside of Robinson, the Bucks are a low-key bunch: Vin Baker, the team's best player last season, is a second-year pro out of the little-known North Atlantic Conference; Marty Conlon, the hero of late, was an undrafted journeyman who will make less than $175,000 this year.
Robinson's recent game of "H-O-R-S-E" was played against Assistant Coach Butch Carter. It came at the end of a voluntary Bucks practice that was scheduled, more or less, so that Robinson would have some teammates to help him run through the still-unfamiliar Bucks' plays. On the court the previous night against Charlotte, Robinson scored 10 points on 50 percent shooting in the first half, but was shaky in the second. It didn't matter, though, to the fans, who consistently cheered his presence on the floor.
"I think they're all just happy to see me here playing," Robinson said. "That's all that matters to them."
And that's all that matters to the Boy Scout leaders, who watch Robinson line up for another shot. Top of the key, knees bent, one hand behind his back, glass required.
The ball banks off the backboard, as demanded. The rest is all net.

HEADLINE: Dwindling Salmon Spur West to Save Rivers

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

DATELINE: EAGLE POINT, Ore.

 BODY:
HOOK-JAWED, wild and still magnificent after its taxing and hazardous struggle up the Rogue River from the ocean 125 miles away, the big coho salmon was beginning to don his scarlet mating colors, just as his kind has done every November for thousands upon thousands of years. But far fewer fish than made the trip just a few years ago are being recorded these days by the video camera trained constantly on a narrow underwater passage through which all migrating salmon must pass to get around Gold Ray Dam.
Lately, annual runs of wild coho on the Rogue as they head for their natal waters on tributaries upstream have been about 80 percent below average. Federal officials are expected to announce soon whether they will declare the coho an endangered species throughout much of the Pacific Northwest. Fisheries biologists say, in fact, that most strains of Pacific salmon -- as valued a totem in this region as the bald eagle is in the nation at large -- are in deep trouble as a result of overfishing at sea, natural climatic factors and destruction of freshwater habitat where the big fish spawn and where their progeny grow large enough to return to the ocean. 
 The wild coho population "is in pretty poor shape," Jerry MacLeod, a state fisheries biologist who directs Oregon's new watershed health program in southwestern Oregon, said as he gazed at the salmon flashing by outside the glass of the viewing station at Gold Ray Dam.
Bright spots are beginning to appear in this gloomy picture, however. Salmon that successfully negotiate pollution, unnaturally warm water and obstructions like dams are about to discover newly improved spawning streams like Little Butte Creek in the foothills of the Cascades, which flows into the Rogue near here. More than anything else, the deteriorating condition of these streams has seriously limited the ability of wild salmon, mainly coho and chinook, to rebound from record low numbers. Now governments, environmental groups, local volunteers, out-of-work loggers and even lumber companies are pitching in to restore spawning and rearing habitat to the complex conditions that salmon require.
To reproduce, salmon must have clean beds of gravel in which to spawn, and the hatchlings must have deep pools of clean water with a lot of nooks where they can hide from predators while waiting to dart into the current to seize aquatic insects, their main food. Under natural conditions, fallen trees create a stream habitat offering "that nice combination of holding, hiding and feeding; it's really neat stuff," said Dr. Ken Cummins, the author of a recent study of salmon habitat conducted for the state of Oregon by the Center for the Study of the Environment, a private research organization in Santa Barbara, Calif.
Over the years, people have removed many of the fallen trees, sometimes in the mistaken belief that migrating salmon could not get over them. As a result, the random assemblies of alternating riffles and pools have been converted to shallower, simplified, more uniform channels with few if any fish. The deliberate straightening of some channels has added to the simplification. Sediment let loose by logging, agriculture and development has choked some spawning beds. The cutting of trees along the stream bank -- the riparian zone -- has deprived some aquatic insects of the leaf litter on which they feed. By eliminating shade, tree removal has also allowed the water to warm, reducing the supply of microorganisms that other aquatic insects eat. Dr. Cummins found that long-term salmon production plummets under these conditions and takes three or four decades to recover after trees reappear and are allowed to grow to maturity.
Happily, freshwater habitat is the element in the equation of salmon endangerment that people can do the most about. Early results are already apparent on the Little Butte, the key spawning and rearing stream of the Upper Rogue watershed.
The area still looks wild and pristine. One raw and rainy day last week, wisps of cloud nestled between the crests of steep hills covered with Douglas firs, while early snow dusted some hilltops. But long reaches of the stream have been ecologically undone by the cutting of streamside trees and removal of fallen logs. Last summer, in what promises to be one of the first of many such attempts to re-create nature in the watersheds of the Northwest, Mr. MacLeod's team brought in huge tree trunks to replace those that had been removed from the stream and anchored them in natural positions.
In just a few months, the scouring movement of water over, under and around the logs has already converted some parts of the stream bed from shallow, open riffles to shoulder-deep pools. After the coho now on their way to the Little Butte spawn this month, the hatchlings will find an inviting nursery. A test of this strategy in another stream increased the number of surviving young salmon a thousandfold, said Mark Grenbemer, a member of the watershed restoration team.
Upstream a bit, where the Little Butte passes through federally owned land, the United States Forest Service has replaced big logs in the stream and planted new trees along the bank to provide a long-term supply of shade and pool-forming logs. The Oregon state restorationists will take this step next summer on some private lands as well. The riparian zone is also to be fenced off from cattle, which pollute streams, destroy bankside vegetation and cause stream banks to crumble. For much of the work, local people, including out-of-work loggers, are being hired at a total cost of about $70 million this year and next.
Little Butte is one of several priority watersheds designated under both state and Federal restoration plans. Oregon is committing proceeds of its state lottery to the effort. Federal funds are being supplied to both state and Federal efforts under the Clinton Administration's Northwest forest plan, devised originally to solve the politically incendiary spotted owl dispute. But salmon have now become its main focus, not least because unlike spotted owls, they enlist broad support in these parts. The Administration is extending the watershed restoration program well outside the range of the spotted owl.
"I started out thinking it was a spotted owl problem, but found that at bottom it was a salmon problem," said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. Harmful land-use practices and mismanagement of ecosystems, he says, are most strikingly reflected and greatly magnified by their impact on streams. And in this region, the health of the salmon population is the clearest indication of stream and watershed health: restoring salmon habitat necessarily restores the biologically rich riparian ecosystem as well.
Various surveys in the last four years have documented the drastic decline and in some cases disappearance of many populations of Pacific salmon. Wild salmon populations, because they spawn in separate watersheds from one another, are isolated and thus genetically distinct. A 1991 study by the American Fisheries Society in the three West Coast states and Idaho found that of 400 distinct stocks of salmon, steelhead trout and sea-run cutthroat trout, 214 were at risk of extinction and 106 were already extinct.
A 1993 study by the Wilderness Society found that the coho -- historically, along with the chinook, the most widespread, abundant and economically important species -- had disappeared from 55 percent of its historic freshwater range in the same four states and was either threatened or endangered in another 33 percent. The status of sockeye and spring-run chinook was almost as depressed.
This year, the National Marine Fisheries Service reported that West Coast ocean catches of coho fell to only 292,000 in 1993 from 5.3 million in 1976, a decline of 95 percent. Chinook, the agency reported, had declined by 80 percent from 1988 to 1992. Commercial offshore fishing for coho has been banned, and for chinook has been sharply restricted.
An abundance of salmon and sea-run trout in Alaska may assure that none of these species will go extinct globally any time soon. Alaskan abundance also assures that the supply of salmon for market is substantially unaffected. But biologists fear that coho, chinook and sockeye, along with steelhead, a sea-run species of rainbow trout, could be erased from all but a small fraction of their former range.
In addition to its imminent ruling on the status of the coho, the National Marine Fisheries Service will rule later on whether to consider the steelhead officially endangered in much of its range. In both the coho and steelhead cases, the habitat restoration efforts will be taken into consideration in deciding the status of the two species and what remedial measures, if any, are required, said Merritt Tuttle, a fisheries biologist who is the senior policy analyst in the agency's office in Portland, Ore.
In both fresh water and salt, the fish are vulnerable to many threats. In recent years, salmon numbers are thought to have been reduced by an extended drought and a drop in ocean food supply brought about by the climatic phenomenon called El Nino. For several years, until the United Nations prohibited the practice, drift-net fishing cut heavily into populations.
In the Columbia River system, hydroelectric dams, which chop up young fish in their turbines, have contributed greatly to the problem. Fish in hatcheries, introduced years ago as a way of supplementing wild stocks, have perversely damaged wild populations by competing with them for food and habitat, and by interbreeding with them. Unlike wild fish, biologists say, hatchery fish cannot maintain themselves in the wild without restocking, and interbreeding weakens the survival ability of wild fish as well.
Unlike many other species, salmon die within days of spawning, making the survival of offspring doubly important.
The Upper Rogue watershed, including Little Butte Creek, encapsulates the problem nicely. Little Butte is one of the few remaining major streams containing salmon and steelhead in the Upper Rogue watershed. Much of the rest of the watershed has been closed off to the fish by Lost Creek Dam northeast of here. On their way to the Little Butte, the fish encounter many obstacles. Some wander into irrigation bypasses and end up as carrion in farm fields. Many are lost at dams with inadequate fish ladders.
"It's a tough life," said Mr. MacLeod.
On the Rogue downstream from here, the Savage Rapids Dam frustrates or kills tens of thousands of migrating salmon each year, fisheries biologists say. The National Marine Fisheries Service estimates that removal of the dam would result in the production of nearly 45,000 more salmon and steelhead a year. Mr. MacLeod estimates that production in the Rogue watershed would grow by 20 percent. After a long and contentious battle, Oregon decided late last month to remove the dam in five years.
The ultimate goal is to restore watersheds "from ridgetop to ridgetop," says Mary Lou Soscia, director of Oregon's watershed health program. The future of the enterprise is not free of uncertainties and potential snags. The Oregon state program is financed only through next year and must be renewed. To solidify citizen support, Oregon is relying on a series of locally created watershed councils. One of the more important, in the Illinois River watershed, has been convulsed by what environmentalists see as an effort by irrigation interests to keep them off the board.
There is also a difference of view on how far a restored and protected buffer of vegetation should extend on each side of a stream. The Federal plan calls for a uniform zone equal to twice the height of the tallest streamside trees or 300 feet, whichever is greater. The Cummins report points out that this is relevant only in mature conifer forests and not in other kinds of riparian areas. Moreover, the report contends, the widths of setback areas should be adjusted to the size of the stream: one size does not fit all.
"Everybody agrees that there's a considerable need for restoration; what isn't agreed on is the most cost-effective way to do it," said Dr. Daniel B. Botkin, president of the Center for the Study of the Environment and director of the larger study of which Dr. Cummins's work was a part. Further reports are due next month.
Despite the scale of the task ahead, hopeful anticipation abounds. The actual work of restoration "is not very dramatic," said Mr. Babbitt, "but the cumulative impact is enormous, and the payoff is very quick."
For his part, Mr. Grenbemer is anxious to assess that payoff by getting into his snorkeling gear and surveying the population of juvenile salmon produced by the fish now about to move into restored stretches of Little Butte Creek. "The fish counts we take this winter are going to be telltale," he said. "I'm really optimistic."

Diagrams: "A Test Case For the Survival Of Breeding Salmon"
 Spawning salmon need clean gravel beds and protected pools in shaded creek bottoms that are amply supplied with fish food in the form of aquatic insects; they in turn need microorganisms as food. Restoring Oregon's Little Butte Creek, which flows into the Rogue River, as a healthy salmon stream requires the efforts of government, industry, agriculture and private citizens.
 
"Re-establishing the Formula for Growing Fish"
 Salmon production takes three or four decades to recover after trees are replaced and allowed to grow to maturity in a protected buffer zone along streams where salmon spawn.

HEADLINE: Indonesia's Embarrassment

 BODY:
Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country. It is a diverse society, rich in both culture and natural resources and eager to take a respected place in the community of nations. So it is appropriate that the Indonesian city of Bogor is hosting the informal summit of the newly formed Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation alliance.
However, Indonesia's image has been marred by the perennially embarrassing issue of East Timor, the former Portuguese colony it invaded in 1975 and forcibly annexed. Anticipating world attention on the summit, 29 East Timorese students entered the U.S. Embassy grounds in Jakarta on Saturday and have refused to move. Rioting in Dili, the capital of East Timor, broke out over the weekend after the alleged killing of an East Timorese merchant by Indonesian soldiers. 
 By some estimates, 200,000 people died in the 1975 invasion, roughly a third of East Timor's population. Since then the Indonesian Government has maintained a huge military presence, encouraged migration of new residents from Java to swamp the native population, punished peaceful dissent and restricted access by outsiders.
In bilateral talks after the summit, Mr. Clinton is expected to raise the issue of East Timor with President Suharto of Indonesia. It is not the only human rights issue he should raise. Equally important are repression of the trade union movement and oppressive policies elsewhere, notably Irian Jaya, Aceh and North Sumatra. Muchtar Pakpahan, chairman of the Independent All Indonesian Labor Federation, was sentenced to three years in jail on flimsy subversion charges last week.
Given Indonesia's authoritarian tradition and its aspirations for world respect, Mr. Clinton can make some reasonable demands in his meeting with President Suharto. The first priority should be to insure the safety of the students inside the embassy compound and other students still at risk.
He can ask that Jakarta drastically scale down its military presence in East Timor. He can push for more local control and unrestricted access by journalists and both international and domestic human rights organizations, and an end to human rights violations such as arbitrary detention and torture, forced birth control measures and violent repression of peaceful dissent.
A final and helpful gesture would be to make contact with Dili's Roman Catholic Bishop, Filipe Belo, who has spoken out courageously in defense of the Timorese people at considerable personal risk.
Indonesia is not a monolith. The recent meeting between Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, and the East Timorese opposition leader Jose Ramos Horta is cause for hope. All these issues are the subject of intense debate within the country, and many Indonesians understand the danger they pose to its international standing. President Suharto must be encouraged to listen to those voices.

HEADLINE: Making China Trade Fairly

 BODY:
China desperately wants to qualify as a founding member of the World Trade Organization. President Clinton obstinately stands in the way -- which is exactly where he belongs.
The W.T.O., according to the trade accord signed by more than 100 countries in April, will be created early next year to oversee international trade. Membership would solidify China's emerging presence in international markets and guarantee that countries would not discriminate against its exports. The United States agrees that China -- which is among the world's 10 largest exporters -- belongs in the World Trade Organization. But the Clinton Administration rightly insists that China agree to adopt the same rules of fair trade that apply to other large countries in the W.T.O. 
 China brazenly pirates about $1 billion worth of intellectual property each year. Music recordings, pharmaceuticals, films and books are copied and sold without compensation to foreign manufacturers holding patents, copyrights and trademarks that other members of the W.T.O. honor.
The Chinese also block imports with layers of testing and licensing procedures that serve only protectionist purposes. And China has dallied in making its rules clear and subsidies transparent to outside examination -- a key to determining whether China lives up to its trade obligations.
China balks at adopting fair-trade rules, demanding exemptions that apply to small, developing countries. But China's presence is huge in international markets. If it wins immediate W.T.O. membership, it will have little incentive to change so that it plays by the same rules as its major trading partners. Mr. Clinton understands that the time to knock down China's protectionist policies is now, as the price of its membership.
China has threatened to scuttle a proposal at this week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit to create a free-trade zone, perhaps as a way to bargain for early admission. That tactic does not seem to have worked. To gain admission to the W.T.O., China should adopt fair-trade principles. Those include treating foreign firms the same as Chinese firms and giving imports a fair shot in domestic markets. The Government must codify its import and investment rules and put its accounts in order so that foreign governments can monitor whether China is unfairly subsidizing exports or expropriating profits from foreign investors. The W.T.O. need not insist that China conform immediately. But phasing in fair-trade rules should be completed in a few years.
China has moved in recent years to lower its tariff and non-tariff trade barriers. It has even moved toward a convertible currency -- which insures foreigners that they can convert future profits to dollars without Government interference. Yet reforms are incomplete and sometimes proceeding slowly.
The Europeans have suggested a sensible compromise by which China would be accorded the status of a founding member, with its privileges suspended until it negotiates terms of entry. Mr. Clinton could embrace such a compromise, as long as he does not waver from demanding that China be held accountable, within a few years, for violations of the rules governing its major trade partners.

The Final Analysis

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
The most interesting explanation of the famous Republican triumph comes from my wife, who is not political and whose mind, therefore, has not been ossified by total immersion in polling statistics.
She thinks it was the inevitable result in a nation with a really heavy channel-surfing habit. Voters treated the familiar old Democrats just as they treat the familiar old TV shows when they plop down in the parlor with a remote-control gadget. 
 They just naturally zapped them, thinking, "Might as well try another pol. Probably won't be much better, but he can be zapped too after I've surfed the entire menu."
If you have been listening all week to talking heads make everything perfectly murky, you may dismiss my wife's explanation on ground that it is excessively simple. Yet the simplest explanation often solves the most baffling mystery.
Recently, for example, I was wrestling with the mystery of why the British refuse to acknowledge that American institutions are clearly superior to their own. With her usual clear-headedness, my wife explained everything with a simple question:
"What can you expect of a country that has only one time zone?"
It seems quite natural that channel-surfing should lead to politician-surfing, for Americans have long been prisoners, as it were, of both television and politicians.
When television consisted of a few networks and an independent station or two re-running old network shows, you could either take it or turn it off. And who could possibly turn it off? Its grip was so unshakeable that the few who could turn it off were jeered as intellectuals and snobs.
Even changing from one channel to another required toil. Overweight bodies had to be lifted, then walked two, three, four feet, maybe bent slightly to touch a dial, a button.
It was easier to lie there and let the arrogant tubemeisters and advertisers give it to you right between the eyes.
Then suddenly -- empowerment! Dozens and dozens of new cable channels became available. And the ultimate weapon -- the remote!
It was like the invention of gunpowder, like the Spanish armies' introduction of the horse as a war engine against horseless, horse-ignorant Indians.
This incredibly powerful new weapon changed the balance of power between TV providers and viewing masses. Viewers no longer have to lie there and take it. Now they lie there and zap it. With more channels constantly becoming available, channel surfers now have to move swiftly and ruthlessly to exhaust the entire entertainment supply before the shows change and surfing has to start all over again.
The terrifying threat of 500 channels, if carried out, will require such intense concentration on the remote that millions doubtless will suffer psychiatric breakdown after repeated failure to surf the entire 500 before all change shows.
Channel-surfing gave millions a taste of power over an old tyrant. Change became a habit in the parlor. It was so easy. You just pushed the button. Didn't even have to get up.
Change is hard for people to accept. Maybe that's why so many politicians stayed in office so long. With the remote working its havoc in the TV room, however, change became a habit. The manipulated herd was herd no longer. It was now a surfer.
When did it begin to feel comfortable with the idea that it could zap a politician and move on to look at another, just as casually as it zapped a shopping channel and moved on to the Weather Channel, then to Bravo, to A&E, to PBS, to the Cooking Channel, the Cosmetics Channel, the Automatic Firearms Channel, the O. J. Simpson Channel . . . ?
It's hard to say precisely when people became comfortable with politician-surfing, but the 1992 defeat of President Bush showed it well under way. President Bush, once so unbeatable that no important Democrat dared run against him, was in a few months so reduced by failure to gratify audience demand for an exciting economic show that he fell to the little-known Bill Clinton.
Clinton was the first beneficiary of politician-surfing, and now of course the surfers seem hot to surf on to another pol after last week's demonstration of how easy it is.
Well, the idea is my wife's. I was in charge of the muddling.

HEADLINE: Big Money Corrupts Politics, Absolutely

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"We're to Blame," says Ronald A. Heifetz, director of the leadership education project at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, for the sorry state of today's politics (Op-Ed, Nov. 8). 
 We perpetuate the crisis of leadership "because we continue to misconceive the leadership we need," Mr. Heifetz writes, and we "scapegoat our politicians, attributing our pains and dilemmas to them as if they caused our predicament."
Mr. Heifetz is right in saying that " 'Throw the bums out!' is the wrong -- even childish -- response to the wrong problem."
But looking for "potential leaders who will challenge us to face the problems that require us to learn new ways" won't solve the main problem: the lock-stock-and-barrel purchase of most politicians by big-money interests.
The same interests provide most of the financing for institutions like the Kennedy School, which train our political elite (and pay Mr. Heifetz's salary).
Moreover, through ownership of the mass media, the country's economic elite also distorts the political debate by publicizing "tax-and-spend," "get big government off our backs" and other nonsensical phrases, while limiting the exposure of contrary views.
Complaining that the electorate is responsible for our political mess is blaming the victim. To restore democracy and fairness to our politics, we need stringent limits on campaign contributions.
Running for office should be paid for mostly with taxpayer money. That is not a new or radical idea. Public campaign financing was first suggested by President Theodore Roosevelt.
Given the accelerating breakdown of the confidence of Americans in our system, it's an idea whose time has finally come.

HEADLINE: You'd Hardly Know Cuba's Open for Business

 BODY:
To the Editor:
This week, public television's Nightly Business Report offered a special series on foreign investment in Cuba. I hope our own business community tuned in and watched with close interest. 
 We are now living in a global economy, and our investors are quickly losing the economic edge on what may become one of the most lucrative markets in Latin America. A case in point is Cuba's booming tourist industry.
There was no tourist industry in Cuba only five years ago, a business Fidel Castro once derided as a corrupt symbol of the capitalist order he overthrew in 1959. But with Moscow's pulling of the plug on subsidies, President Castro and his Communist Government reluctantly approved an aggressive foreign tourist program to obtain hard currency to prop up the disastrous Cuban economy. It seems to be working.
Cuba's Instituto Nacional del Turismo reports that in 1989, 326,000 foreign tourists visited Cuba, rising to 600,000 in 1993. It projects an 8 percent increase for 1994.
The hard-currency goal is paying off too. In 1989 tourists brought $250 million into Cuba, and in 1993, $466 million. Although Americans are not part of this new tourist market, it is a market to be reckoned with.
Where United States investors have lost out, Spanish and Canadian investors have stepped in. Through state-run partnership deals, they have bought into some of Cuba's choicest tourism properties.
Newly constructed as well as refurbished resort hotels at Veradero Beach along Cuba's Riviera, like the Hotel Veradero International, are some of the best investments American hotel chains have missed out on.
Three years ago Spanish investors took over Havana's landmark Hotel Nacional de Cuba, restoring it and opening it under their exclusive management. Now a five-star establishment, it is the No. 1 hotel for foreign business people.
On my last trip to Havana I visited the Hotel Seville, formerly the Seville-Biltmore, which had just reopened after restoration of its Moorish facade and fountained interiors. Still another Spanish group has bought into the more modern Habana Libre, the former Havana Hilton and Havana's No. 1 tourist facility. This group plans a total renovation of what is sure to become one of Cuba's most profitable partnerships.
There are other lucrative properties being missed out by United States investors, like the Gran Teatro de Habana, home to the National Ballet, the Lyric Theater and the Symphony Orchestra. This architec-
tural belle epoque masterpiece has just been acquired by Spanish investors for $1 million.
There are restaurants too, like the renovated El Floridita, Ernest Hemingway's favorite eatery, known as the place where the daiquiri originated. There are mega-industries, like oil exploration, which is dominated by the Venezuelans, the French and the Norwegians; and telecommunications, which is dominated by the Mexicans, further excluding United States investors.
Will the Clinton Administration wake up to get United States investors in on some of these valuable partnerships before the best ones are gone?

HEADLINE: Interest Rate Illogic

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Once more we're seeing the Federal Reserve Board preparing to raise interest rates in the name of fighting inflation, which is cooling down the economy. 
 As an architect designing custom houses, I never could see the logic of fighting inflation by raising the interest rates paid to purchase (and produce) these big-ticket items.
It's not only houses: everything we have is built, bought and shipped with borrowed money. Adding on yet more interest cost is piling on and effectively guaranteeing inflation, not combating it.

HEADLINE: Political Depression Hits Brunch Belt

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
What did you think of the election?
Like Dorothy on the Yellow Brick Road, New Yorkers on the Upper West Side of Manhattan responded to the question posed to them on the sidewalk by figuratively tapping their heels together and whispering, there's no place like home.
The Upper West Side is the heart of liberal New York, which makes it the heart of the heart of liberal America, a kind of urban college town, the East Coast version of Berkeley, Calif., or Madison, Wis. True to form, a week ago, Assembly Districts 67 and 69, which more or less define the area, not only returned their Democratic incumbents, Scott M. Stringer and Edward C. Sullivan, to the State Assembly with some 80 percent of the vote, but they voted for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo by more than 6 to 1. Of course, Mr. Cuomo lost, along with many others of his ideological ilk across the country. 
 So how does the liberal Upper West Side feel now?
"The liberal Upper West Side is very upset," said Fran Schoen, who was walking along West 79th Street yesterday.
Indeed, in interviews over the last two days with often loquacious if weary-sounding people, the same adjectives kept surfacing: upset, distressed, disgusted, depressed, frightened, appalled.
Why they feel this way -- aside from the fact that their side lost -- is a question people found harder to answer, but it seems to have its roots in a kind of pride. The Upper West Side, with its well-educated populace, its bookstores and bagel shops, its older, lefty intellectuals and younger, upwardly mobile families, has long felt itself in the vanguard of social justice.
Many expressed gratitude and appreciation to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for his endorsement of Governor Cuomo. And now, with the Mayor in disrepute among the ruling party, there's a sense among Upper West Siders that the Mayor is one of them, and that heathens have united to repudiate their entire lot.
"I feel uncertainty and fear," said Matt Fried, a psychologist who was wheeling his 3-year-old daughter, Gaby, along West 80th Street yesterday. But he added, "I feel community here."
Downtown a block, Charles Kleinbaum, 54, a lawyer, was out for a midday stroll with his Chihuahua. "Giuliani had a lot of guts doing what he did," he said. "And now that he's picked the wrong person, the city's going to suffer because the Republicans seem a little vindictive."
Referring to the newly elected Republicans as "these people" -- as in, "These people are not going to find a way to cut the budget without affecting the services of those who need them" -- Ms. Schoen, a retired teacher who has lived in the neighborhood for 40 years, reflected the downtrodden-ness of many of her middle-class peers who find themselves suddenly opposed to the Zeitgeist, and are cast by the outspoken soon-to-be House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, as the enemies of normal Americans.
"Am I depressed?" said Susan Stone, a research scientist, who was window-shopping on Broadway on Sunday afternoon. "Of course, I am. Everyone I know is."
So were some people she didn't.
"I'm more depressed than anyone," said Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, a 41-year-old physician who grew up in Oklahoma. He was one among many who voiced the idea that the essential and essentially appealing quality of Manhattan is that spiritually even more than physically, it is but an island off the coast of America. "This is why I left the Midwest, and now it's caught up with me," he said. "The only consolation I have is that I grew up during the McCarthy era, and there was life after that."
Pausing in front of Shakespeare's, the bookstore on Broadway and 81st Street, Alfred Shapiro nodded at his wife, Jaclyn, and said: "She's depressed. I take a longer view. As the West Side goes, so goes the West Side."
Mrs. Shapiro nodded.
"He predicted it," she said, shuddering, particularly at the promise of the Governor-elect, George E. Pataki, to reinstate capital punishment, which Governor Cuomo staunchly resisted. "I can't imagine living in a state with the death penalty. It makes you feel less than human."
Mrs. Shapiro, 63, added, "I'm so old I'm afraid I'll never see the pendulum swing back."
In addition to liberalism, the Upper West Side is also a bastion of psychotherapy. And several therapists in the neighborhood said politics frequently found its way into sessions, though it's too soon, they said, for any reaction from last Tuesday to have settled in on the couch.
"These things take a while to filter through people's offices," one doctor said, insisting, like many others, on anonymity to protect her patients. "When Giuliani was elected, I heard a lot about it."
The big topic regarding politics, she said, "is whether to stay in the city."
"Especially people with young children," she said. "One person I'm seeing now comes to mind; he's well put together, not a crazy guy, who has the feeling that the world is coming to an end. Everything he lived for in the 60's and 70's has disappeared."
Of course, every now and then a contrary voice piped up. "I'm not your typical Upper West Sider," said Joel Martel, a rather big-voiced iconoclast sitting in the jammed Barnes & Noble bookstore cafe. "I'm a neo-Con. So of course I'm delighted."
Mr. Martel, 48, a lawyer, added: "I think there are more and more people turning to conservatism because of the failure of the Democrats and the increasing dependency of people on the largesse of the state."
In spite of his best efforts, Mr. Martel was unable to engage the diners around him in a debate. Indeed, it seems as though few on the Upper West Side want to listen to Republicans, even if they do have the loudest voices right now.
Though that isn't to say some aren't secretly conceding. A number of people shrugged, admitted defeat and looked on the bright side, saying, in one way or another: Oh, well. At least we can look forward to the tax cut promised by Mr. Pataki.
"Economically we'll probably do better," said a 56-year-old doctor walking in Riverside Park. The man, who would give only his first name, Bob, said, "I don't mind doing better, but when I think of what's going to happen to this city, I don't have an optimistic outlook."

HEADLINE: Asia-Pacific Countries Near Agreement on Trade

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Tuesday, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Eighteen nations of the Asia and Pacific region were on the verge of a sweeping agreement to stimulate economic growth by seeking the removal of barriers to trade by 2020, senior officials said on Monday night.
As part of the overall goal of "free and open trade" in one of the fastest growing economic regions in the world, the officials said, the United States, Japan and other developed nations are expected to accept an earlier goal for ending their trade barriers, probably by 2010. The United States had previously resisted the earlier date. 
 The trade agreement is expected to be endorsed later today at the summit session of the leaders of the nations of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, known as APEC. The session began this morning, with President Clinton in attendance.
Held at the presidential palace in Bogor, 40 miles south of Jakarta, the meeting opened on an informal note, with the leaders wearing batik shirts made for them by a top Indonesian designer.
The trade accord would be nonbinding, and is not expected to contain any commitments for immediate actions. Nevertheless, it represents a victory for the United States, which had pressed for a timetable to the lowering of trade barriers despite wariness by some countries, particularly Malaysia and China.
Many delegates at the forum have been saying that the whole success or failure of the meeting of the nations of the Asia-Pacific forum would be defined by whether or not a timetable could be agreed upon.
Those countries resisting the specific timetable are concerned that they would be forced to deregulate their economies and expose themselves to foreign competition too quickly.
Backers of the trade agreement hope that liberalizing trade and investment will allow for a maintenance and perhaps acceleration of the economic boom in a region that spans four continents and accounts for more than 38 percent of the world's population and more than 40 percent of total trade.
Officials cautioned that until the final summit meeting, there was still a chance that some parts of the accord could change. But they were satisfied that the summit meeting would end on a positive note.
"It has come together," the trade minister of one Western nation said. "It's all been finally agreed."
President Clinton said he did not want to "jump the gun" on the declaration today, but that an agreement would increase jobs for Americans.
"This week's discussions, I believe, will allow us to take a critical step forward toward free and open trade throughout the region," the President said at a news conference Monday afternoon. "Already one-third of our exports go the Asia-Pacific region. Already two million American jobs are tied to this region."
Earlier on Monday, Mr. Clinton met separately with President Jiang Zemin of China, President Kim Young Sam of South Korea, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama of Japan and Prime Minister Paul Keating of Australia. He also met on Monday evening with Mr. Kim and Mr. Murayama together.
The leaders meeting with Mr. Clinton separately reinforced their commitment to carry out the recent agreement between the United States and North Korea aimed at curbing the communist nation's suspected nuclear weapons program.
A declaration setting a target for free trade would represent a coming of age for the Asia-Pacific group, an organization that started five years ago as a forum for talking and is little-known even in its own region. Now APEC is showing signs of changing from an acronym to an institution that will produce concrete changes, much the way that the early beginnings of economic cooperation and discussions in Europe evolved into a powerful trading bloc. Many emphasize that they are not contemplating anything as powerful or all-encompassing as the European Union, however.
President Suharto of Indonesia, relishing his role as host of the summit meeting despite some unwanted attention being paid to his Government's human rights record, said the expected agreement proved the ability of industrialized and developing nations to work together.
"In spite of the tremendous diversity of our cultures, political systems and stages of development of our economies, we have been able to envision a community of Asia-Pacific economies imbued with a growing spirit of partnership," he said in a welcoming speech at a dinner of grilled salmon, smoked duck and fruit at the Jakarta Convention Center.
A senior official of one Asian country said that Malaysia, China, Japan and South Korea were reluctant about setting a target date of 2020.
The United States, meanwhile, strongly advocated the 2020 date but balked at accepting the 2010 date for developed countries.
Washington was said to be concerned that American industries might protest if American markets were opened to products from Southeast Asia before the booming Southeast Asian markets would open to American products. Criticism from American businesses, they feared, might threaten congressional approval of the new world trade agreement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
But developing countries insisted on an earlier date, saying their industries need more time to adjust to foreign competition than those of the advanced nations.
A possible problem was posed by Malaysia, which remains opposed to the timetable. It is not clear what Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia will say at the final meeting on Tuesday. Mr. Mahathir does not want the Asia-Pacific free trade plan to usurp a free trade area being formed by six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. He also says East Asia nations should have their own economic forum, free of influence from western countries like the United States.
Officials of member nations expect that Mr. Mahathir will, in the end, go along with the declaration.
The Asia-Pacific members generally say they do not want their organization to become an exclusionary trade bloc, leaving barriers to countries outside the region. Even after GATT, many Asian nations will have high trade barriers on some products, like automobiles.
Jakarta has been swept clean for the visit of the foreign dignitaries, and the Government has declared a holiday to relieve traffic.
Despite Indonesia's efforts to show off its economic progress, the summit has also focused attention on the Government's press censorship, suppression of labor movements and continuing protests over its annexation of the former Portuguese colony of East Timor in 1975.
Nearly 90 protesters were reported arrested in clashes with security forces in East Timor on Monday, the second day of disturbances. Meanwhile, 29 East Timorese students protesting Indonesia's policies continued the sit-in they began on Saturday morning at the grounds of the American embassy in Jakarta.
On Monday, two American journalists who had been arrested trying to enter East Timor tried to distribute leaflets in the Asia-Pacific conference press center announcing that they were holding a news conference. Security guards swarmed and tried to take away the leaflets, in front of the international press.
The Asia-Pacific leaders' final declaration today is not expected to define concretely what is meant by free trade or how to achieve it. The meeting next year in Osaka, Japan, will start to work out some of those details.

HEADLINE: THE NEW CONGRESS: TRADE;
HELMS REQUESTS A DELAY IN VOTE ON TRADE ACCORD

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
With a threat to disrupt the Administration's foreign policy plans, Senator Jesse Helms urged President Clinton today to delay a Congressional vote on a worldwide trade pact until next year, a move that could unravel the 123-nation agreement.
In a letter to Mr. Clinton, Mr. Helms, who is expected to become chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee when the Republican-led Senate takes office in January, objected strenuously to the Administration plan to push through the bill in a special session that begins after the Thanksgiving holiday. 
 Mr. Helms, a staunch conservative from North Carolina who has made it clear that he plans to challenge a number of Administration foreign policies, said in the letter that it would be unwise to vote until hearings on the accord are held.
"If you will agree to this, Mr. President," Mr. Helms wrote, "I can assure that it will have an exceedingly positive effect on my making certain that the Administration's positions on all foreign policy matters during the 104th Congress will be considered fairly and fully."
Mr. Helms made his statement as the Administration's hopes of quick and relatively painless passage of the comprehensive free-trade agreement by the current Congress are crumbling. The letter also is the first substantial disagreement to surface among the Republicans since Election Day, as they begin to stake out more detailed positions and flex their political muscles in anticipation of taking power.
A number of Republicans, traditionally the party of free trade, are splitting with the new leadership and abandoning the trade accord. They are joining forces with conservative Democrats, labor unions and some consumer-rights advocates who have mounted a lonely campaign against the pact, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Still apparently on the fence is the most important player in the vote in the Senate, the future majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas. Mr. Dole has generally voiced support for the agreement, but in recent weeks has backpedaled, saying that he is concerned that sovereignty would be undercut by the new World Trade Organization.
That organization will act as something of a court of world trade, capable of sanctioning signatories to the agreement that it judges in violation of the pact. Opponents of GATT contend that the deck will be stacked against American interests and that the international trade organization, in which every member country will have an equal voice, will try to undermine American competitiveness.
Mr. Dole met all afternoon with Mr. Clinton's chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, who emerged predicting that Mr. Dole would ultimately support the agreement. In Jakarta, Indonesia, today, Mr. Clinton also expressed willingness to find a compromise with Mr. Dole, saying that he understood that people "want to be assured that we're not giving up the ability to run our own affairs."
"So we're working on it, and I think we'll resolve it," Mr. Clinton said.
House and Senate staff members said today that Mr. Dole was asking for the creation of a panel of Americans to review every trade decision against the United States and recommend whether remaining part of the trade agreement is in the country's interest. In coming days Mr. Dole will be negotiating on the issue with the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor.
The prospective House Speaker, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, came out in favor of passing the pact this month.
A senior Administration official said today that although the vote could be close, "I think we'll have it at the end of the day."
"In the end," the official added, "these guys know this is too big and too important not to get done."
Mr. Helms's letter leaves the Administration with an uncomfortable choice. If it pushes ahead with GATT, which seems all but inevitable, it gives the likely new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee an excuse to slow approval of treaties or ambassadors and investigate foreign aid and appropriations for the United Nations, long targets of his wrath.
If the Administration delays, however, the next Congress could pick apart the trade accord.
Any changes to the agreement would require reopening the negotiations that took 12 years to complete, and most trade experts say that would kill the agreement.
For Mr. Clinton in particular, a delay would be an enormous international embarrassment. The United States has led the drive for the bill for 12 years, beginning with the Reagan Administration. And Mr. Clinton has made the pursuit of free-trade agreements -- in Asia this week and with Latin American countries at a summit in Miami next month -- the linchpin of his international economic strategy, arguing that it would vastly increase American exports.
The free-trade zones that he is discussing with Asia and Latin America are premised on adopting the trade agreement, which is scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 1. All of America's main allies have delayed passage, however, until they see what Congress does.
The lame-duck session on GATT was originally forced by a Democrat, Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina. He, like Mr. Helms, represents powerful interests in the textile industry, which has led the objections to the lowering of tariffs that the accord requires.
Most other business organizations favor agreement, however, and they have scheduled events on Capitol Hill starting on Wednesday to press for quick passage.
In his letter Mr. Helms argued that it was extremely unwise to consider the trade agreement under the rules that Congress agreed to last year to limit the House and the Senate to a straight up-or-down vote on the entire agreement.
"Mr. President," the letter said, "I implore you to inform the Senate that you are willing for consideration of the GATT implementation bill to be delayed until very early in 1995, thereby permitting meaningful public hearings at which significant witnesses on both sides can be heard."
Mr. Hollings is using his last days as the chairman of the Commerce Committee to press his attack on the accord, arguing that it would cost billions of dollars in lost tariff revenue and untold numbers of jobs. Mr. Hollings has essentially dismissed the arguments of many economists that the United States would emerge as a big winner because other nations would be forced to reduce far more tariffs than the United States would.
Today, Mr. Hollings dismissed the Administration's contention that in the long run far more jobs will be created by opening big emerging markets like Indonesia and Chile and by speeding their transformation into consumers of American software, automobiles and electronics.

HEADLINE: Bumper Crops Pose Political Problem for Farmers

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The nation's farmers have been reaping their most bountiful harvest ever in many important crops, benefiting shoppers for groceries from meat to cooking oil but costing taxpayers an estimated $3 billion to $4 billion in additional farm subsidies.
Production of corn, the nation's biggest crop, is expected to reach 10.01 billion bushels, nearly 5.6 percent higher than 1992's record crop and almost 60 percent more than last year when the Midwest flooded and the Southeast baked, according to Department of Agriculture estimates released last Wednesday. Production also soared to new records for rice and soybeans, which are widely used in animal feed, cooking oil and food ingredients. Wheat crops, while short of records, were larger than average. 
 Analysts say that food prices will rise between 2 percent and 3 percent next year because of higher transportation and packaging costs, but that the increase might have been a full percentage point higher without the bumper harvest. Consumers could save more than $6 billion. But the same bounty has driven prices paid to farmers so far below Government support price targets that deficiency payments will soar. It now appears that direct payments could reach $12 billion to $13 billion next year, a sharp increase from the $8 billion to $9 billion the Department of Agriculture expects to pay out this year.
The potent display of what today's technology-rich farmers can achieve in a year when the weather cooperates -- and its impact on the Federal budget -- could not have come at a more sensitive time politically, according to many farming experts. The laws that govern most Federal farm policies, which run for five years, are up for renewal next year. Critics of farm subsidies in the Republican-majority Congress, among them such powerful figures as the projected House majority leader, Dick Armey, a Texas Republican, will be in their best position in a long time to weaken farm-support programs, some of which date back to the New Deal.
"We know we are going to be on the chopping block," said Representative Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican who is expected to become chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and who is fighting to minimize cuts in farm-support programs. "We will be debating not just what kind of farm bill we'll have, but what the rationale is for any bill."
Mr. Roberts, whose district includes wheat farmers who have been among the biggest benefactors of Government supports, said he hopes to switch the focus from subsidy programs to legislation that would give farmers more flexibility over what they plant on land in Government programs and fewer restrictions on the chemicals and methods they use.
All that would help to improve production efficiency and reduce the need for Government support payments while preserving the basic outlines of policies that have provided Americans with a steady, inexpensive supply of food, Mr. Roberts said. The expectation of some level of price support is built in to farmland prices and the financial structure of most farms, creating the potential for a disastrous rural economic crisis if farmers are left completely exposed to market forces, he added.
But this year's crop underscored how difficult it is for the Government to manage supplies, its chief method of controlling the costs of grain subsidies. A growing number of critics want any future payments severed from production and linked directly to environmental goals, such as taking ecologically fragile land out of production. Some want stricter limits on the size of operations that receive subsidies. Under current rules, one operation may have many owners, with each allowed to pocket up to $50,000 a year in direct price-support payments when corn, rice or wheat falls below a target price.
The Government has been steadily chipping away at subsidies since the mid-1980's. One tactic in the grain sector has been to steadily lower the target price it uses as the baseline for calculating support payments. Another has been to restrict the amount of land a farmer has in the support program. And on those acres left in the program, the farmer can only be credited with the amount of corn per acre he raised in 1980, not the far-higher yields that are routine today.
The Government also attempts to keep prices up to levels where subsidies are minimal and to reap environmental benefits by paying farmers to put ecologically sensitive land into its 34-million-acre Conservation Reserve Program.
But getting the balance right still involves luck. Worried that grain reserves were dangerously low after bad weather in 1993, the Department of Agriculture eliminated grain set-asides. Farmers responded by planting 10 percent more acres in corn and soybeans. When they were blessed with adequate rain, plenty of sun but not too much heat at the right times and a mild harvest season, the results overwhelmed storage capacity in many regions.
"We got 15 bushels of corn an acre from one of our farms last year and 175 this year," said Neil Harl, an Iowa State University agricultural economist, describing the impact of the rebound in the western Corn Belt.
For the last month, corn has been piling up on the ground outside grain elevators across the Midwest. Corn prices plunged at some elevators to nearly 40 cents below the Board of Trade futures contracts, which bottomed in October to about $2.13 a bushel, then drifted up to yesterday's close at almost $2.17 on signs of stronger than expected demand. Mothballed terminals as far away as Norfolk, Va., where Cargill Inc. once held crops destined for export to Europe, have been hurriedly reopened to store soybeans.
One source of demand has been exports. Large orders from China for soybean oil have caused a sharp rebound in that market, and a falloff in Chinese corn exports has created an opening in world markets for American corn. A brutal drought in Australia has led to a sharp increase in American wheat exports -- and prices.
Some of the grain demand has also come from hog, poultry and beef farmers. The low prices have almost no effect on products like cereal -- corn accounts for about 5 percent of the cost of corn flakes -- but have a sizable impact in meat markets. Feed accounts for 70 percent of the cost of raising a chicken. The price for calves destined to become beef has rebounded in recent months as the projected cost of raising them declined. And hog farmers, suffering through a glut that has sent prices down to 30 cents a hundredweight, too low for even the most efficient producers to make a profit, are able to hang on to their hogs longer and wait for prices to rise.
The biggest beneficiaries of low grain prices are a Who's Who of agriprocessors. Low costs for grain and higher demand for meat, corn syrup, cooking oils, ethanol and other grain products have profits soaring at companies like the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Cargill, Conagra Inc., Tyson Foods Inc. and Hormel.
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy took a major step toward halting the price decline for grain with his initial decision in September -- made final Tuesday -- requiring farmers receiving corn-price supports to set aside 7.5 percent of their eligible land next year.
The set-asides have already hit the stocks of seed companies like Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc. and the DeKalb Genetics Corporation, and analysts say that agrichemical companies may have trouble matching this year's sales. Fertilizer suppliers will fare better than pesticide producers because a big crop like this year's drains more nutrients from the soil. Indeed, fertilizer demand is already higher this fall as farmers who finished the harvest early start preparing fields that will not be set aside for next year.
By contrast, farm-equipment sales have begun to slow in response to higher interest rates, the 1995 set-aside and low crop prices, with October sales down 10 percent from the corresponding month last year. Analysts say that actual farm income will be about the same next year, when many payments from this year's crop will be received.
"But if the only reason farm receipts are even is the Government is giving you $4 billion more, it doesn't make farmers confident," said Thomas Burns, who follows farm equipment companies for NatWest Securities.
Even as the impact of the bumper crop ripples through the economy, agricultural economists are looking ahead anxiously to spring planting. Reserves are still modest by historic standards. A bad start next year could send prices higher even as farmers who held on to much of this crop send it to market. But a spring like this year's could raise fears of a much steeper price plunge.
"The one thing for sure," said Richard Brock, a Milwaukee-based farm marketing consultant, "is that what happened this year ensures lower support prices from the next Congress and more volatility down the road."

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Nov. 15

 BODY:
In setting their vast and vital region on the path toward free trade by the year 2020, the leaders of 18 nations around the Pacific Ocean have taken a step that appears to be a bold move toward the future.
But whether it will truly be so judged by history will depend not so much on what the leaders said today but on how their "declaration of common resolve" is translated into action. Carrying out the free trade agreement will be far more arduous and contentious than merely enunciating the vision. 
 The declaration, issued from a colonial-era palace in Bogor, 40 miles south of Jakarta, proclaimed a "commitment" to achieve "free and open trade and investment" in the Asia-Pacific region by the year 2020. The industrialized nations in the group, like the United States, Japan and Canada, are to achieve the goal no later than the year 2010.
The goal is ambitious -- the world's largest free trading area, one that spans four continents and encompasses countries that now account for more than half the world economy, and more than 40 percent of its trade.
"This is the biggest single trade initiative in history," said C. Fred Bergsten, the American economist who chaired an advisory committee that helped draft the plan. "This is half the world deciding to eliminate barriers to trade and investment."
By contrast, he said, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade covers potentially the entire world but does not seek complete elimination of barriers.
But it will probably take several years for the first tariff cuts or other measures to be seen. The advisory committee chaired by Mr. Bergsten called for complete schedules of what steps should be taken to be finished by the year 2000 and for the first tariff cuts and other liberalization steps to begin that year. But that date did not make it into the final draft of the Bogor declaration.
Dismantling trade barriers will also not come naturally for the countries of East Asia. They have achieved their rapid economic growth in part through a strategy of offering Government incentives and protection to domestic industries.
American companies might benefit from increased exports of foods and industrial products. Automobile production is one area in which American companies could benefit by lower tariffs. In many nations of East Asia, imports of cars are virtually prohibited by high tariffs and other barriers, in order to build up the domestic industries of each country.
One of the effects of trade liberalization could be in the area of investment patterns. Right now, with imports difficult, Mitsubishi Motors has factories in Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia in order to sell in those countries.
But if trade were liberalized, it might export from Japan instead, or build one big factory in one country to serve all the others. Toyota is now moving toward a model where it makes different parts in different nations and then supplies all the others.
To make its region more attractive as a place to do business, the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, is already liberalizing trade at a fast rate. A company can make high technology components in Singapore or Taiwan and lower tech components in Malaysia, then have them assembled in Thailand to take advantage of the strengths of each country.
To be sure, the Bogor declaration does not clearly define free trade. Does it include trade in services as well as goods? Does it mean complete elimination of tariffs, something less, or something more? The document is also not legally binding and contains some language that appears to allow countries to drag their feet.
But such lack of specifics can be excused at such an early stage. Even getting all 18 nations to agree on the common goal was a big accomplishment, since it was only one year ago that President Clinton first invited the sometimes suspicious government leaders to meet on Blake Island near Seattle to talk about a "new Pacific community."
"Our main aim was to agree on the broad target and not to get bogged down at this stage in definitions and how to do it," said Hamish MacLeod, Hong Kong's financial secretary and its representative at today's summit meeting.
Eventually, however, the APEC members will have to get around to such questions, and that is where the difficulties will intensify. Indeed, barely was the ink dry on the Bogor declaration today than differences in interpretation began emerging.
For instance, many of the nations think South Korea is industrialized enough to be among the early liberalizers. But South Korea wants to be in the late group. The declaration itself is deliberately vague on where South Korea belongs.
An initial blueprint for putting the declaration into effect is expected to be ready by next year's meeting in Osaka, Japan. American officials expect that trade will be freed gradually through a series of small agreements, rather than through one comprehensive agreement as in the case of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
As the host country, Japan will have the leading role in pulling together a blueprint, a fact that gives pause to some of the other nations since Japan does not have a reputation as a free trader.
At a news conference today, Japan's Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama, was somewhat restrained in praising the agreement.
"We expressed our political will for a broad direction based on a long-term perspective," Mr. Murayama said. But when asked if Japan will have to open its markets for agricultural products as a result of the Bogor Declaration, he said the matter would have to be looked at.
No doubt the most contentious issue at today's meeting was establishing the target date of 2020. The date seems so far away that it is easy to dismiss as almost meaningless.
"It doesn't require anybody to really change very much," said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a former United States trade negotiator and president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. "People can all say they are free traders without having to change current protectionist practices."
The long-range nature of the goal no doubt made it easier for some of the reluctant nations to sign on to the Bogor declaration. After all, as one Prime Minister noted at Tuesday's summit meeting, the Sultan of Brunei was the only one among the leaders in the room with a chance of still being in office in 2020.
But looked at from another perspective, the target is impossibly ambitious. GATT was started 45 years ago and still hasn't brought about totally free trade. The Asia-Pacific plan will try to do it in 25.
It is possible that once the process starts, the pace will accelerate as businesses and politicians warm to the idea. This has happened with free trade agreements in the past.
The original European Economic Community agreement called for a phase-in period of 12 years but completed it in 7. Earlier this year the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations decided to accelerate by five years the timetable for freeing trade among themselves.
