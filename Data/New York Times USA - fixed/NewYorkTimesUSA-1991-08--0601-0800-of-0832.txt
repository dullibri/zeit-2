HEADLINE: Dow Gains 5.99 as World Rally Continues

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Stock prices kept heading upward yesterday after a big lift on Wednesday from the collapse of the Soviet coup. While the Dow Jones industrial average added only slightly to its previous gains, two other indexes posted record highs.
Earlier, in Europe, markets rallied strongly, picking up the momentum from Wednesday, when many markets closed before the final reports of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's return to power. 
 The Dow gained a slight 5.59 points, to 3,007.38. But the Standard & Poor's 500 index of the most important stocks rose to 391.33, a gain of 0.74 point, and the New York Stock Exchange's composite index rose 0.45 point, to 214.34.
Volume on the Big Board was down sharply from Wednesday, with 173 million shares changing hands, compared with 232 million the day before. Advances outnumbered declines, 896 to 698, with 127 issues reaching new highs.
 
Return to Reality
 Several analysts said that the rally that had lofted the Dow 88 points higher on Wednesday had run out of steam and that broader concerns about the domestic economy would again take center stage.
"This is a return to reality, and the reality is that the economic recovery is anemic," said Alan R. Ackerman, executive vice president at Reich & Company.
"World markets rallied overnight and gave the market in the United States some spark at the opening," he added. "But euphoria over the return of Gorbachev settled down, and the market got back to business. The market has been locked in the 2,850-to-3,050 trading range for more than five months and has had difficulty breaking through the upper end of that range."
In London, the Financial Times index of 100 leading shares rose 0.8 percent, the level it was at before the coup, and added a few extra points to set a new closing high of 2,623.01. In France, the CAC-40 jumped 1.5 percent to end at 1,819.13, just a point below its pre-coup level.
In Germany, the Dax index of leading shares jumped 60 points, or 3.8 percent, to 1,630.83, just 20 points below its pre-coup level and well within its recent trading ranges.
And in Japan yesterday, the Nikkei index of 225 issues rose 2.1 percent, to 22,515.77, just 300 points from its level last Friday. Today, however, profit-taking pushed the index down 450.43 points, or 2 percent, to 22,065.34.
 
Day of Gyrations
 The Dow gyrated wildly throughout the day, beginning with a strong rally in the opening minutes of trading. After several rounds of back-and-forth movement however, the Dow stood below its opening level shortly before 4 P.M. for the fourth time in the day before a final, brief rally.
Oil stocks generally gained, based on the belief that American oil companies might now be able to participate in developing the Soviet Union's vast oil reserves. ARCO gained 1 1/8, to 121 5/8; Exxon rose 1/4, to 58 1/2; Mobil rose 1/2, to 66 7/8, and Shell rose 5/8, to 54 1/4.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.33 point, to 518.3, a gain of less than one-tenth of a percent. The American Stock Exchange's composite index was up 1.8 points yesterday, to 368.08, a gain of nearly half a percent.
The most active issue on the big board was Salomon, which dropped 2 1/8, to 22 5/8, with four million shares changing hands. The stock is still reeling from the effects of revelations about irregularities at government-debt auctions.
One of the biggest gainers on the Big Board was Metronic, a maker of pacemakers, which was up 4 5/8, to 129 7/8, on improved first quarter-earnings.
Another big gainer was IMC Fertilizer, up 4, to 58 7/8, following an analyst's report that the prospects for grain sales to the Soviet Union brightened with the fall of the coup.
Nearly two-thirds of the Dow's gain yesterday was attributed to three stocks: International Paper, which rose 1 5/8, to 68 3/8, a day after the company completed its acquisition of Leslie Paper; Alcoa, which rose 7/8, to 66 3/8, because analysts said the company was still gaining from news earlier this month of a restructuring, and Chevron, a member of the strong oil group, which rose 3/4, to 71 5/8.

HEADLINE: A Breakthrough in Connecticut

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell Weicker's perseverance finally paid off yesterday. The Connecticut legislature, ending a bitter standoff, approved a state income tax. That's a striking advance, bringing an element of fairness to the state's obsolete tax structure and offering hope for a crippled economy.
Before the vote, Connecticut was one of only 10 states without a personal income tax. The state depended for revenue on an 8 percent sales tax -- the nation's highest -- which burdened the poor, as well as on exceptionally high taxes on dividends, interest and capital gains, which was calculated to drive out business and wealth. 
 Faced with a severe deficit almost one-third the size of the state's $7.5 billion budget, Mr. Weicker, elected as an independent, boldly proposed an income tax in February. It's a measure of his courage, and the tenacity of the Democratic and Republican legislators who refused to face up to the problem, that it took three gubernatorial budget vetoes before good sense prevailed.
The budget plan, quickly signed into law, imposes a 4.5 percent tax on all income; the impact on low- and middle-income taxpayers is softened by credits and deductions. It also lowers the sales tax to 6 percent and expands the list of taxable items.
Lobbying was fierce up to the last minute. In the final hours three Democratic Senators, Gary Hale, Marie Herbst and Steven Spellman, honorably switched sides in order to break the embarrassing and damaging deadlock.
The income tax won't guarantee that Connecticut, which faces huge disparities between wealthy suburbs and poor inner cities, will bounce back quickly from its economic problems. But 54 days after the start of its fiscal year, the state at least has a budget that strikes a blow for political responsibility and equity.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Triumph And Decline

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

 BODY:
The extraordinary drama of this week was in one sense a testament to what Mikhail Gorbachev has achieved. Six years ago it was unimaginable that Soviet citizens would join in mass resistance to tyranny. He has opened his people's minds to the possibility of freedom.
But the denouement also showed Mr. Gorbachev's limitations. On his return to power he defended the Communist Party. He turned to the same old party types for acting heads of the K.G.B., Defense and the Interior -- figures like the very men who had joined the coup against him. 
 In his press conference he seemed unwilling or unable to recognize the depth of two political trends accelerated by the coup: the discrediting of Communism and the movement away from centralized power, toward a federation of genuine republics.
The tumult of these days leaves us, then, with an ironic possibility. At the moment of his triumph, history may be leaving Mikhail Gorbachev behind.
In personal terms the press conference was vintage Gorbachev, colorful and convincing. Here was a man who had been isolated for 72 hours, fearing for his life; now, after a sleepless night, he was telling all about it in colloquial language. When the coup leaders demanded that he resign, he said, he told them: "You will never live that long."
But politically he was less convincing. In describing how the coup was undone he focused on himself. He praised the Russian people, but without really conveying a sense of their achievement in standing up to armed troops and the secret police. He praised Boris Yeltsin, but again without fully measuring the importance of his resistance to the coup.
Soviet journalists in the room applauded the reference to Mr. Yeltsin. That unusual gesture was a reminder of the political reality that Mr. Gorbachev seemed to ignore: After this week's events the president of the Russian Republic has strong public support and will expect corresponding influence.
Mr. Yeltsin may well have expected to be consulted about reconstruction of the Soviet Government after the coup. But Mr. Gorbachev apparently did not talk to him before making the key appointments.
Skepticism was evident in the first question at the press conference after Mr. Gorbachev's long opening statement. Why had he, last year, appointed the kind of people who would plot against him? In reply, a BBC commentator pointed out, he gave no real reason and no indication that he would make future appointments differently.
(The BBC had superb coverage of the Soviet crisis. Americans who heard it may have agreed with Mr. Gorbachev, who said his aides had fixed up old radios in his vacation home so they could hear foreign broadcasts, "BBC best of all.")
Then Mr. Gorbachev was asked whether he would give up his stewardship of the Communist Party. His answer was a long, defensive statement about the ideals of Socialism.
"To say that the October Revolution was a catastrophe would be wrong," he said. It was fine until Stalinism spoiled it. "We shouldn't confuse one thing with another."
Millions of his countrymen, more all the time, fervently disagree with his defense of Communism. The reality to them is not his utopian vision but a sucking bureaucracy, a non-functioning economy, a poisoned land.
After the last week anyone should be wary of making predictions about the Soviet Union. But there is strong reason now to think that it will move toward decentralization, private property and democracy -- move, if need be, with Mr. Gorbachev reduced to a marginal role.
To say such things is not easy, because Mikhail Gorbachev has accomplished so much. He freed the outlying states of the Soviet empire. He got out of Afghanistan. He reached an entente with the West in crucial areas of the world. Most important, he encouraged his people to think and speak for themselves.
The makers of the coup underestimated that last achievement. It is a perfect symbol that after they fell thousands of people in Moscow marched on the Lubyanka, the headquarters of the K.G.B., where Stalin's prominent victims were shot. As the crowd chanted, the huge bronze statue of Feliks Dzerzhinsky, the Polish aristocrat who founded Lenin's secret police and started the reign of terror, was pulled down.

HEADLINE: Send Help -- and Plenty of It

BYLINE: By Richard Burt; Richard Burt was Ambassador to West Germany during the Reagan Administration.

 BODY:
It is tempting to sit back and luxuriate in the clear victory for democratic change in the Soviet Union. But this would be a major mistake. The failed coup was not only a close call for the Soviet Union; it was also a wake-up call for the United States and its Western partners.
A successful coup would not only have scuttled reform in the Soviet Union. It would probably have also meant the end of the new Start treaty, complicated the Mideast peace process and perhaps halted the Soviet military withdrawal from Eastern Europe. 
 Fortunately, we have been spared all this. But no one should assume that political and economic reform are now assured in the Soviet Union. Further crises surely lie ahead. Accordingly, the United States and other Western countries need to think again about their approach to encouraging change in the Soviet Union.
Western conservative skepticism about him -- doubts that extend to some extent into the Bush Administration -- needs to be replaced by unambiguous support for the man and his program. President Gorbachev was and remains the man presiding over the transformation of Soviet society.
At the same time, the U.S. will have to get used to dealing with the heroes of the moment -- Boris Yeltsin and heads of the other republics -- whose authority will be strengthened and legitimized in the new union treaty.
Perhaps the most important task for Americans now is to commit to substantial economic assistance. That was the recommendation of a team of Harvard and Soviet specialists that recently proposed a step-by-step aid package.
But most policy makers and experts had argued that economic aid and credits were premature, that the Soviets had not demonstrated a sufficient commitment to political and economic reform. Indeed, even after this week's events, some Bush Administration officials expressed this view.
It is true that only the Soviets themselves can transform their republics into modern, efficient industrial democracies. But there are several steps we should consider taking. One would be to convene an extraordinary Group of Seven summit meeting, perhaps in Berlin, where the cold war began and ended, with both Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin invited as guests.
The purpose of the summit would not only be to provide reinforced political help for the two leaders, but to discuss a much more far-reaching program for economic support than the one agreed to in London.
Such a program might consist of increased technical assistance in energy, transportation and agriculture; economic aid, perhaps in the form of balance-of-payments assistance, a currency stabilization fund and, finally, credits to promote increased investment by Western companies.
It would also be important to get Western business and academic experts involved, perhaps by asking them, together with the U.S. Government, to take the lead in establishing a "democracy corps."
Hundreds and maybe thousands of American business people and academics would work for a year or two in the Soviet Union, helping with the huge task of creating local democratic institutions and a market economy.
This idea and other recommendations for aid are controversial. Many U.S. conservatives remain skeptical of the prospects for change in the Soviet Union, while liberals would rather spend money on domestic programs.
But a Republican Administration might be prepared to exercise greater vision if it believed that a Democratic-controlled Congress was prepared to support such an economic assistance package.
The Soviet people have showed their courage and commitment to change. How can we do less?

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues in Moderate Rise

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities posted modest gains in fairly active trading yesterday, as the tension of the last few days drained out of the credit markets.
"The Salomon scandal and the Soviet crisis have sort of prevented people from really focusing on the market for the last week or so," one government bond trader said. "But now people are feeling more comfortable, and getting involved in the market for fundamental reasons." 
 Market participants said that for the first time in the last several sessions retail accounts were actively buying long-term bonds.
"There is some demand for long paper for the first time in a long time," the trader said. "That in turn is creating trading opportunities in all maturities."
 
Note Auctions Next Week
 With auctions of new two-year and five-year Treasury notes expected next week, dealers said that market participants were paring exposures in shorter-term maturities and buying longer-dated issues.
The surge of supply of new shorter-term issues actually began yesterday, when the Treasury auctioned $12.5 billion worth of new one-year bills.
The bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.36 percent, more than half a percentage point below the 5.88 percent average rate at the last one-year bill sale on July 25. It is the lowest rate on a one-year bill in nearly 5 years. On Aug. 28, 1986, the Treasury sold one-year bills at an average discount rate of 5.33 percent.
A jump in initial claims for unemployment insurance for the week ended Aug. 10 surprised some analysts, but the 22,000 increase, to 430,000, had only a momentary impact on prices in the credit markets. It was the second straight week that initial claims showed an increase.
 
Little Reaction to Money Supply
 Market participants also showed little reaction to weekly money supply figures, even though the growth was weaker than most Wall Street economists had expected.
For the week ended Aug. 12, the Federal Reserve Board reported that two of the three money measures it follows posted declines. The third, broadest measure, M-3, rose by $1.8 billion.
M-2, the measure most closely tracked by the Fed, fell by $3 billion in the week, putting the aggregate below the 2.5 percent yearly growth target that is at the low end of the Fed's target range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent.
Most analysts had expected a much more modest, $1 billion fall in M-2.
Nevertheless, economists said that continuing weakness in M-2 growth would not, when viewed in isolation, prompt the Fed to ease monetary policy.
"There probably isn't too much the Fed can do at the moment to boost it," said Wayne Smith, an economist at Reid Thunberg & Company, an investment advisory firm in Westport, Conn. The weak money numbers "will provide good support" in justifying an easing move, Mr. Smith added, but the Fed "won't move on that sort of a number alone."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 100 29/32, up 5/32, to yield 8.04 percent, down from 8.05 percent late Wednesday.
Among note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at 100 23/32, up 2/32, to yield 7.77 percent. The 7 5/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 102 22/32, up 2/32, to yield 7.21 percent. And the 6 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 101 5/32, down 1/32, to yield 6.22 percent.
Rates on outstanding short-term Treasury bills moved slightly higher.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.28 percent, up one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by three basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.29 percent.
A number of new issues were offered in the market for investment-grade corporate securities.
Among the issuers was Toys R Us, which offered $200 million worth of 30-year bonds through an underwriting syndicate led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The 8 3/4 percent securities were priced at $100, or par, 70 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated AA-3 by Moody's Investors Service and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
South Carolina Electric and Gas offered $155 million worth of 30-year securities through underwriters led by Paine Webber.
The 8 7/8 percent securities, which mature Aug. 15, 2021, were priced at $98.70, to yield 9 percent, 96 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021.
The issue is rated A-1 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues were unchanged in light trading.
Municipal bond traders said that prices of most widely quoted tax-exempt issues rose by about 1/8 point. Activity was light, they said.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE COUP;
JAPAN RELUCTANT ABOUT SOVIET AID

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 22

 BODY:
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu hailed the collapse of the coup against President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and lifted a freeze on Japan's aid to the SovietUnion today, as Japanese officials took steps to blunt a renewed campaign for increased international aid to Moscow.
 Government officials expressed concern that Japan will be expected to provide financial support for the Soviet Union if the West decides to bolster Mr. Gorbachev's Government, without respect for Japan's strong reservations. 
Japan has been trying to persuade Moscow to return four northern islands seized in the waning days of World War II. Mr. Kaifu has insisted that Japan will back only limited technical and humanitarian aid to the Soviets until this issue is resolved.
 "Of course, Japan is very much interested in the global situation, but the reality is that as far as Soviet policy toward Japan has gone, there have been no substantial changes during Gorbachev's term, so I don't see any radical changes now," said Kinya Niizeki, a former Ambassador to Moscow.
 
Calls for Heavy Aid
 Already, France, Italy and Germany have issued new calls for large-scale international aid to the Soviet Union, arguing that an improving economy would help to stabilize the transition to democracy and a market economy. But after meeting in Brussels with NATO officials on Wednesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d reiterated the American position that money will do nothing until Mr. Gorbachev opens the Soviet economy.
 Japan has been pleased by the American position but realizes, Government officials said, that there is likely to be greater impetus to the efforts to give Mr. Gorbachev some more visible form of support than he has been provided so far by the West.
 Koji Watanabe, a Deputy Foreign Minister, has been sent to London and Washington to convey Japan's views and to make certain that they are considered as the West deliberates.
 
Promoting the G-7's Role
 Another important sign of concern on this issue has been Japan's repeated calls for consultations through the Group of Seven, a largely economic-oriented gathering of the world's seven largest industrialized countries.
 Neither the United States nor other members of the group have shown much interest in transforming this body into a political forum for managing East-West issues. But the G-7 includes Japan, while the traditional forum for dealing with the Soviet Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, does not.
 "Japan wants to avoid a situation where NATO writes a prescription for how it wants to deal with the situation, and Japan is just sent a bill later," said Yukio Okamoto, a former senior Foreign Ministry official who was involved in Japan's response to the Persian Gulf crisis.

An Exaltation of Alligators, in a Swamp of Trouble

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: POCONE, Brazil

 BODY:
Crocodiles slither off river banks. Marsh deer crash through the brush. At sunset, trees fill with a primeval profusion of tropical birds. Flooding an area nearly the size of Britain, the Pantanal (the name means great swamp) is the world's largest wetland.
Ever since 16th-century colonists introduced cattle with rot-resistant hooves, the Pantanal has been the isolated preserve of a few hundred cowboys maintaining herds of cattle in balance with nature. But now new forces of change are gnawing destructively at the edges of this vast wilderness in the heart of South America. About 80 percent of the Pantanal is in Brazil, with the remainder in Bolivia and Paraguay. 
 "The threats to the Pantanal come from outside: soy farming, gold mining, cheap tourism," said Valdo de Luiz, a grizzled rancher who recently opened a hotel to beat the loneliness of living in Pocone, a Massachusetts-sized administrative territory where cows far outnumber people.
 
An Exaltation of Fauna
 In the surrounding savannah, a soy boom in the 1980's turned this frontier state, Mato Grosso, into Brazil's fourth-largest soybean producer.
But a stiff price has been paid: large quantities of fertilizers and pesticides washed through this fragile ecosystem, which is home to 232 types of fish and 650 species of birds. Causing more visible damage, deforestation of river banks for farming has caused severe erosion and silting in the Pantanal river system.
"Twenty years ago, a 40-ton barge could navigate the Taquari River," said Nilson de Barros, president of a private landowners group, Society for the Defense of the Pantanal. Discussing one of several major rivers in the swamp, he said: "Now a four-ton barge has tremendous problems."
 
Chasing What Glitters
 A gold rush has drawn 300,000 miners to the state, but pollution controls have yet to follow. To separate gold from dirt and rock, miners use large quantities of highly toxic mercury, which is later dumped into rivers that flush the Pantanal basin.
Pinpointing another source of water pollution, a recent survey of the 70 municipalities in the Pantanal watershed found that none of them have sewage treatment plants.
The Pantanal's wildlife is also under attack. With alligator shoes, belts and handbags in high demand in Europe, Japan and the United States, poachers smuggle a million illegally harvested skins out of the Pantanal every year. In some areas, scores of alligator carcasses have been discovered, only their tails missing. The tails have become a delicacy in some European restaurants.
"Four alligators makes one pair of shoes," Miguel A. Castelino, a nature guide, said as visitors admired a group of them sunning themselves on a muddy bank of the Pixaim River.
 
'Change of Attitude'
 The number of tourists to the Pantanal exploded from 15,000 in mid-1980 to 150,000 this year. One factor boosting tourism was "Pantanal," a hit television soap opera that enchanted audiences 1,000 miles from here, in Brazil's coastal cities. The drama alternated the region's heart-stopping scenery with heart-pounding underwater love scenes.
But as in Brazil's other endangered wilderness, the Amazon rain forest, awareness is growing about the need to reconcile human development with nature preservation in the Pantanal.
In one incentive to action, world environmental attention will focus next June on Brazil when it plays host to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development.
"There has been a tremendous change of attitude by the local authorities," said Janice S. Wiles, Brazil program officer for the World Wildlife Fund. Ms. Wiles is working with environmental officials to set up safeguards for a proposed $200 million World Bank loan for agricultural development to Mato Grosso state.
Most preservation efforts in the Pantanal seek to work with economic forces, not against them. In the 1980's, the authorities tried to repress alligator poaching through police raids. Although the forestry police won a few shootouts, they found themselves outgunned and outwitted by poachers equipped with radios, submachine guns and light planes.
In a new tack, officials this year authorized the export of skins from alligators bred in hatcheries. Under an experimental system, five Pantanal breeders are collecting alligator eggs in the wild, where only 7 percent of the eggs survive. In hatcheries, protected from predators, 99 percent of the eggs survive. Breeders are required to return 10 percent of any baby alligators to the wild.
In one year, an alligator bred in captivity will provide a smooth skin, largely free of blemishes. In contrast, wild alligators reach maturity in three years, often under rough conditions that damage their skin.
"We are going to compete with the illegal, wild skins," said Mr. Barros, who served until last year as Environment Secretary for Mato Grosso do Sul, a state that includes half of Brazil's Pantanal. He predicted that by 1995, regional hatcheries would export 150,000 captive-bred skins.
 
Jaguars Under Siege
 In Mato Grosso do Sul, a Government ban on fishing during the egg-laying season helped fish stocks rebound after overfishing by sportsmen. Anonymous letter writers have alerted the authorities to abuses ranging from illegal deforestation to expeditions of trophy hunters shooting jaguars, an endangered species.
A regional research-exchange plan has been signed by universities in Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, three countries lapped by the Pantanal waters. Last year, Mato Grosso do Sul started an environmental-exchange program with Florida, which is trying to save the Everglades.
"They are spending a fortune to restore the Everglades," Mr. Barros said of the diked and drained Florida marshland, one sixth as big as the Pantanal. "The Everglades are an example of what we shouldn't do."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 30, 1991, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Aug. 23 about environmental destruction in the Pantanal region of Brazil referred incorrectly to a species being depleted by poachers. A zoo curator has pointed out, in a letter received Sept. 16, that the animals are Yacare caimans, an endangered species belonging to the alligator family, not alligators, which are not endangered and are legally farmed for their skins. Research on the issue by the writer of the article was delayed by his absence from South America.

HEADLINE: Ciba-Geigy Profits Up

BYLINE: By Reuters

DATELINE: BASEL, Switzerland, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Ciba-Geigy A.G., the drug and chemical conglomerate, said today that its earnings rose in the first half of this year and its net operating profit in the whole of 1991 would improve from last year's 1.03 billion Swiss francs, or $682 million.
"Sales performance in the first quarter, the improvements in productivity and the development of exchange rates encourage us to make the statement that the profit for 1991 is expected to exceed that of the previous year," the company said in a statement. 
 Ciba-Geigy, which does about a third of its business in the United States, said profit in the first half rose despite worse economic conditions than in the comparable period a year earlier.
Profit after tax in the six months to June 30 rose to 1.27 billion francs, or $834 million, from 1.22 billion, or $801 million, last year.
Sales were little changed at 10.95 billion francs, or $7.25 billion, compared with 10.91 billion, or $7.22 billion.
Cash flow increased to 1.83 billion francs, or $1.20 billion, from 1.75 billion, or $1.15 billion.
"The favorable growth in pharmaceutical and agricultural sales and internal measures taken to increase productivity were the main reasons for the improvement," it said.
Compared with the first quarter this year, the results for the second quarter were markedly better, although the modest economic upturn so far had only minimally affected the major customer markets in Europe and the United States, it added.

HEADLINE: U.S. Vehicle Sales Dropped 10.2% in Mid-August

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks fell 10.2 percent in mid-August, reflecting somewhat weaker demand in the United States auto market than analysts had expected.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales from Aug. 11 to 20 was 6.1 million, a drop from 6.2 million in early August, and a sharp decline from the rates of 6.7 million in June and 6.8 million in July. 
 Analysts said they had anticipated a lower annual selling rate for August, because of strong fleet sales earlier in the summer, particularly by the General Motors Corporation.
 
'More Severe' Than Expected
 "We expected there would be some payback for June and July," said Harvey Heinbach, an automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York. "But that payback is proving to be somewhat more severe than what we were looking for."
Stephen Girsky, an auto analyst at Paine Webber in New York, said the latest figures suggested that "the retail demand is still soft and the recovery in auto sales is still slow." He said a lack of confidence among consumers was delaying any recovery by the auto industry.
Mr. Heinbach and Mr. Girsky had been forecasting annual sales rates through August and September of approximately 6.6 million units.
Michael Bowyer, who tracks the auto industry for Duff & Phelps in Chicago, agreed that consumer confidence remained a problem.
"It's difficult to take the temperature of the economy right now, and consumers are having trouble as well," he said. "They're in a 'hold back' response with cars, which are one of the most deferrable expenditures there are."
 
Fourth-Quarter Gain Expected
 Mr. Bowyer said he did not expect the United States auto market to start showing sales improvements over last year until the middle of the fourth quarter.
Mr. Heinbach of Merrill Lynch noted that car dealer inventories were low and that some sales might have been lost because of spot shortages.
Manufacturers with American operations sold 143,480 domestically built cars in the Aug. 11-20 period, a decline of 10.7 percent from a year ago. Sales of vehicles classified as light trucks, which account for about one-third of all vehicles sold, declined 9.5 percent.
Overall sales of cars and light trucks by the domestic Big Three declined 12.8 percent in mid-August. The Japanese auto makers that produce cars in the United States posted a 7.0 percent increase.
 
G.M. Car Sales Off 13.4%
 General Motors, the industry leader, reported that it sold 60,710 cars in mid-August, or 13.4 percent fewer than a year earlier. The company sold 36,137 light trucks, a drop of 16.2 percent. Oldsmobile and Buick were the only two G.M. divisions to post higher sales, because of strong demand for the redesigned Buick Park Avenue and Oldsmobile 98.
The Ford Motor Company sold 37,970 cars, a drop of 10.5 percent, and 28,883 light trucks, a decline of 20.9 percent.
Sales for the Chrysler Corporation were estimated by Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry newsletter, at 13,000 cars, a drop of 27 percent from last year's figure. Its light-truck sales were estimated at 21,200 for the 11-day period, up 24 percent. Chrysler reports its sales on a monthly basis only.
The Honda Motor Corporation was the only member of the Japanese Big Three to show an increase over last year. Honda's car sales rose 21.6 percent, to 14,983, in mid-August.
The Nissan Motor Company's car sales fell 19.7 percent, to 2,512, while truck sales dropped 5.7 percent, to 3,486. The Toyota Motor Corporation's sales of cars fell 4.8 percent, to 9,946.

HEADLINE: U.S. Issues Plunge on Durables Data

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
An extremely strong reading on the economy sent the credit market reeling yesterday, and prices of Treasury securities plummeted in moderately active trading.
The reported 10.7 percent increase in durable goods orders for July, the largest monthly rise in nearly 21 years, caught analysts by surprise. Even though much of the increase resulted from a big increase in aircraft orders, economists said the report strongly suggested the manufacturing sector was on the road to recovery. 
 "These numbers blow away the notion that we are going to have a double dip recession," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence Inc.
Some analysts have been concerned that the tepid, though positive, signs of recovery visible in recent weeks might be on the wane, and that after a quarter of slightly positive growth the economy might begin to contract again in the third quarter.
 
Order Backlog Rises
 Excluding transportation orders, the data showed that new orders rose a strong 6 percent last month. As important, some economists say, was a 1.4 percent increase in backlogs of new orders, the first increase in four months. Economists watch this series closely because manufacturers do not tend to begin adding to employment rolls until order backlogs begin to mount.
Analysts cautioned against reading too much into one strong report. Indeed, auto sales data released yesterday, which showed that sales were a disappointing 6.1 million units at an annual rate for the middle 10 days of August, provided evidence that the recovery would be mild.
"The car sales numbers were quite pathetic," Mr. Yardeni said, "and suggest the recovery will not be as strong as the durable goods report implied."
Nevertheless, analysts and traders said the durable goods report was strong enough to dissuade the Federal Reserve Board from easing monetary policy in the near term.
 
Influence on the Fed
 "The broad-based power in the durables numbers should cause the Fed to do nothing for a period of time," one government securities trader said. "If the Fed had been looking to ease for arcane money supply reasons, they have probably lost a window."
Traders did not seem to consider the import of the auto sales figures because prices of Treasury securities, which fell sharply after the durable goods report, never recovered.
In the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 100 late yesterday, down 7/8 point, to yield 8.12 percent, up from 8.04 percent late Thursday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 5/8, down 5/8 point, to yield 7.86 percent.
Prices of the new two-year and five-year notes to be sold at auction next week also got hammered.
By late in the day, the new two-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.43 percent. Late Thursday the issue was offered in when-issued trading at a price to yield 6.26 percent.
 
Yields Are Up
 Meanwhile, the five-year notes were offered in late when-issued trading yesterday at a price to yield 7.39 percent, compared with 7.25 percent late Thursday.
The prospect of no immediate move by the Fed to lower short-term interest rates caused Treasury bill rates to move sharply higher.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.36 percent, up 8 basis points, or eight-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by 15 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.44 percent. And one-year bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.47 percent, up 13 basis points.
The sharp selloff in the Treasury market did not cause a similar plunge in other fixed-income markets.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues fell by 1/4 point to 1/2 point.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues dipped by 1/4 point to 3/8 point in quiet trading.

HEADLINE: Kerry Sees Help on Americans Missing in Asia

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Aug. 23

 BODY:
The leaders of Vietnam and Cambodia have renewed pledges of an "open inquiry" to resolve rapidly the fates of Americans listed as missing in action in those Southeast Asian nations, Senator John Kerry said today.
After a weeklong visit to Vietnam and Cambodia, Mr. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, said the two Communist countries had promised to allow United States helicopters to take part in the search. They also pledged to welcome Americans making their own inquiries and to give unprecedented access to a newly formed Senate committee investigating the possibility that some of the missing Americans are still alive, he said. 
 "I think it is very significant that they are willing to have that kind of intrusion, that kind of open inquiry," Mr. Kerry told a news conference. "It seems to me at first blush that they are extraordinarily committed to make that happen."
 
Met With Many Officials
 During his trip to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam and Phnom Penh in Cambodia, Mr. Kerry met with Do Muoi, head of Vietnam's Communist Party, Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia and a number of other officials in both countries.
Mr. Kerry's comments echoed those of United States officials who say that Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos have significantly stepped up cooperation on the issue of 2,273 Americans listed as missing in Southeast Asia.
Vietnam is eager for diplomatic relations with Washington and the lifting of a United States trade embargo hampering recovery of that country's ruinous economy.
Mr. Kerry, a highly decorated Vietnam War veteran, said he made the trip to lay the groundwork for an effort by the 12-member Senate committee he heads. Mr. Kerry said he also planned to visit Laos.
 
Did Some Stay Behind?
 Mr. Kerry indicated that he thought a small number of Americans may have stayed behind in Vietnam of their own free will, but he declined to give details.
"It is very difficult to comprehend the rationale for a government to formally be holding somebody, and I saw nothing while I was there to change my mind about creating a rationale," he said when asked about possible American prisoners of war in Indochina.
Mr. Kerry said Vietnamese leaders agreed to allow a small United States team, based in Hanoi, which is searching for missing Americans to have more logistical support, including helicopters. He said three to four American helicopters may be sent to Vietnam to assist the search, with the Vietnamese doing the flying.
He said this would allow quicker movement to areas where "live sightings" of Americans are reported.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Sharp Climb On Durable Goods Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar moved sharply higher yesterday, helped by a report on orders for durable goods that indicated the economy was returning to health.
The Commerce Department said orders for durables soared 10.7 percent in July, with gains in almost every major industry group. 
 The figures caught the foreign exchange markets by surprise, as economists had predicted a 2 percent gain. "The numbers were staggering in terms of expectations," said Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager with the Bank of New York.
The figures provided evidence that the economy was regaining strength. Economists warned that the surge in orders probably could not be sustained in coming months, but they added that the increase was a sign that the economy would not fall back into recession.
The report heartened foreign exchange traders because it raised the possibility that the Federal Reserve would be under less pressure to lower interest rates to restart the economy. The dollar, like other currencies, is supported by stable or higher interest rates.
Yesterday's report gave the dollar new strength after declines in the last few days. The currency surged on Monday after news of the Soviet coup, then lost ground when it appeared that the takeover by hard-liners had failed. The dollar is viewed as a relatively safe investment during international turmoil.
The British pound fell to $1.6775 in New York yesterday from $1.6935 late Thursday. In earlier London trading, sterling fell to $1.6738 from $1.6975.
Against the German mark, the dollar strengthened after a volatile week, closing at 1.7475 marks, up from 1.7295.
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen, closing at 136.90 yen in New York, up from 136.60 late Thursday. In Tokyo overnight, before the durable goods figures were released, the dollar fell by 0.05 yen, to 136.70. It was quoted higher in London, at 136.75 yen.
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's prices, were: 1.5275 Swiss francs, up from 1.5090; 5.9345 French francs, up from 5.8795, 1,304.75 Italian lire, up from 1,293.75, and 1.14415 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14325.
In the precious metals markets, gold fell 90 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York, to $353.40 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $353.50, down $1.

HEADLINE: Fed's Meeting in July Backed a Neutral Policy

BYLINE: By AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers voted last month to maintain a neutral monetary policy that did not favor further interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy, according to minutes of their meeting released today.
Nevertheless, less than a month later the Fed cut short-term interest rates out of concern that the economy's nascent recovery might falter. At its latest policy meeting this week, a similar resolution favoring a neutral policy on rates was believed to have been adopted, but comments by Fed officials have suggested that with inflation dropping the Fed has the room to ease rates further if needed to stimulate the economy. Raising rates, for the time being, appeared to be out of the quetion. 
 The minutes of that meeting, held on Tuesday, will not be released until Oct. 4.
The minutes of the July 2-3 meeting reported that "an upturn in economic activity had begun in recent months." At the same time, the minutes continued, "excluding food and energy items, increases in consumer prices had been small in recent months."
Thus, the Fed policy makers believed "that at this juncture an unchanged policy course offered the greatest promise of reconciling the committee's goals of sustaining the nascent business recovery while also fostering further progress against inflation."
 
A Unanimous Vote
 The vote to maintain current policy was 10 to 0.
Until last March, the Fed's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, had favored a bias toward lower rates to stimulate the economy. It had voted at that time to adopt a neutral policy that would permit the Fed to act according to economic developments.
Since then, the Bush Administration and many private economists have called on the central bank to cut rates further to insure the economic recovery.
Indeed, after the release of several weaker-than-expected reports in late July and early August, the Fed on Aug. 6 permitted the key Federal funds rate to fall to 5.5 percent from 5.75 percent. The rate is the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans and has been lowered nine times since the recession began in July 1990.
The Federal Open Market Committee, composed of the Fed board members in Washington and five of the Fed's 12 regional bank presidents, meets eight times a year to formulate monetary policy. The board has two vacancies.
 
Stance on Money Supply
 The minutes of the July 2-3 meeting also show that the committee voted 10 to 0 to continue the 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent target range for money supply growth for the remainder of 1991.
But two members who voted to maintain the target for the rest of the year voted to reduce the range in 1992 as a hedge against inflation. They were Wayne D. Angell, a governor, and Robert P. Black, president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank.
A reduction in the target would tend to push interest rates higher, dampening both inflation and growth.
The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, had told Congress in mid-July of the policy makers' decision to extend the target range. But he said the extension was provisional and would provide sufficient leeway to allow monetary tightening in reaction to any unexpected resurgence of inflation or monetary easing to help a faltering recovery.

HEADLINE: Realty Family In Bankruptcy

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NASHUA, N.H., Aug. 23

 BODY:
The Tamposi family, one of New Hampshire's largest real estate developers, filed for bankruptcy protection today after a deal with creditors collapsed.
The six children of the real estate developer Samuel Tamposi Sr., who is not involved in the bankruptcy filing, list about $106 million in debt on real estate investments in southern New Hampshire. 
 The family said it had been working since April to structure a debt plan that asked the banks not to sue or foreclose for four and a half years while they sell the real estate.
The Tamposis reportedly planned to sell off more than 100 properties, including office buildings, condominium projects and offices.
"Unfortunately, we learned yesterday that a few of our many lenders are unwilling to accept the plan as the best means of resolving our indebtedness," Samuel Tamposi Jr., president of the Tamposi Company, said today in a statement.
Rather than give some creditors preferential treatment, the family decided to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, he said, which will allow it to reorganize while fending off creditors.
The Tamposis are among several New England developers to default on loans in the recession. Property values have plunged, causing problems for builders, banks and many other businesses.

HEADLINE: A Public Apartment Tower May Now Be a Private One

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
A state appeals court has ruled that New York City can no longer block Columbus Park Towers on the West Side of Manhattan from withdrawing from a state-subsidized middle-income housing program and converting to a private cooperative apartment project.
In a 3-to-2 ruling on Thursday, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court said the city was required to approve the conversion, even though it opposed it. 
 Columbus Park Towers, a 162-apartment co-op building at 100 West 94th Street, is part of a sprawling mixed-income housing development in a designated urban renewal area bounded by West 87th and 97th Streets and Amsterdam Avenue and Central Park West.
Because of its location on an urban renewal tract, the city had argued that any so-called privatization of the project would be counter to the city's original urban-renewal goals.
 
Wider Impact Seen
 Marvin Wexler, a lawyer who represented Columbus Park Towers, said the ruling was "significant." A lawyer for the city said the ruling could affect as many as 10 other similar middle-income housing projects that are seeking to become private cooperatives.
A spokesman for Felice L. Michetti, the city's Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, said Ms. Michetti would have no comment until she had read the court's ruling. But an assistant Corporation Counsel for the city said the ruling would be appealed to the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals.
At issue are so-called Mitchell-Lama housing projects in the city that were approved by the Legislature 36 years ago. They extended tax breaks and other financial incentives to private developers who built rental and semi-cooperative apartment buildings for middle-income residents.
Projects that began after May 1, 1959, were given the option of withdrawing from the state program after 20 years. Columbus qualified for this option, since it was begun in 1963.
But the city opposed the withdrawal, and its opposition was upheld in December by Justice Bruce Wright of State Supreme Court.
 
40-Year Wait Sought
 The appeals court, however, reversed Justice Wright's decision yesterday and ordered the city to withdraw its objection.
A majority of the court disagreed with the city's contention that "privatization" would defy the intent of urban renewal, saying "there is simply no evidence that it was the planner's overall conception to freeze the socio-economic make-up of the West Side for 40 years." That was how much time the city wanted Columbus to wait before converting to private status.
Moreover, the court said that the city's argument that residents of the building would "reap a windfall" by acquiring their apartments at a fraction of their market value did not hold in the face of the current decline in real-estate values.
Lawyers on both sides said they expeated the issue to be finally decided by the Court of Appeals.
The majority decision was written by Justice Richard W. Wallach. Concurring with him were Justices Joseph P. Sullivan and George Bundy Smith. Justices Betty Weinberg Ellerin and David Ross dissented.
Housing officials said there are 421 Mitchell-Lama projects with 170,000 apartments in the city, some of them rentals and some co-ops. Last year, 20 of them had been withdrawn from the state program and 20 others had withdrawal applications pending.

HEADLINE: Sale of Midtown Office Tower May Be Bad Sign for Market

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
In a potential real-estate deal sending shivers through New York's already depressed office market, Citicorp, the city's largest lender to developers, said yesterday that it was negotiating the sale of a vacant 42-story office tower that it holds in foreclosure to Bertelsmann A.G. The sale would most likely be at a loss.
Bertelsmann, the diversified German concern whose United States holdings include RCA Records and Bantam Doubleday Bell, the publishing concern, confirmed the negotiations. 
 If a deal is struck, the price would almost certainly be far below the $250 million mortgage that Citicorp holds on the building. Banking industry analysts say that if Citicorp is considering selling a major building at a large loss, then other banks are likely to be considering similar deals on foreclosed properties, cumulatively undermining Manhattan office prices.
The potential "is to put a real damper on any kind of recovery in prices" in the Manhattan office market, said Michael Giliberto, a real-estate analyst for Salomon Brothers.
 
Large Portfolios of Losers
 The vacant building, rising above Times Square at 1540 Broadway, is a sleek glass tower which was completed in 1989. It came onto the market after the city had sunk into recession, following the ebullience of the 1980's, when more than a dozen other new office towers were added nearby because of city zoning incentives.
In addition to Citicorp, other major lenders including the Chase Manhattan Corporation and Chemical Bank are burdened with large portfolios of nonperforming real-estate loans and smaller but still troublesome blocks of vacant office space held in foreclosure.
Although New York City so far has not had foreclosures and distress sales on the same scale as the Southwest, "we could see the same kind of overhang develop," Mr. Giliberto of Salomon Brothers said.
Trish Heimers, a spokeswoman for Bertelsmann, said yesterday that its "goal is to find the lowest possible cost of occupancy." The company has 2,000 Manhattan employees, now split between leased offices on the Avenue of the Americas and on Fifth Avenue. One benefit of acquiring a building would be to have staff in one place, she said.
 
Initial Offer of $100 Million?
 Nonetheless, Ms. Heimers said the company was "in no rush" and was "talking to a lot of people."
At Citicorp, Ann Luzatto, a company spokeswoman, said, "We are in discussion with Bertelsmann and others," whom she declined to identify.
Both companies declined comment on a report in The Wall Street Journal yesterday that Bertelsmann had made an initial bid of $100 million, but real-estate industry executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that they believed the offer had been made and rejected.
Still, analysts said that if Citicorp is intent on selling, it must accept the reality of a seriously ailing market.
 
'May Break a Logjam'
 The company's foreclosed real estate is "a drag on morale and a drag on management time," said George M. Salem of Prudential Securities.
"I think Citicorp is coming to the realization that waiting may be even more expensive" than selling at a steep discount, he said, adding that a major sale like one at 1540 Broadway "may break a logjam" at several banks.
Nonperforming real-estate loans by major New York banks have been growing rapidly. Citicorp said yesterday that its nonperforming loans on commercial property totaled $2.8 billion, with $169 million held in foreclosure.
But Mr. Salem said the numbers were far higher because of a "weird method" of accounting used by the bank in which real-estate loans are sometimes counted as commercial loans. In an analysis he conducted, Citicorp's nonperforming commercial real-estate loans totaled $5.9 billion, with $2.3 billion in foreclosure. He said the Chase Manhattan Bank had $3 billion in loans, with $800 million in foreclosure, and Chemical Bank had $1.8 billion, with $700 million in foreclosure.
Complicating sales of foreclosed properties, particularly when they involve large losses, is the kind of international loan syndication adopted in the 1980's. Since the loans are shared by banks, insurance companies and others around the world, several parties must agree on a price.
On 1540 Broadway, Citicorp was the lead lender, but syndicated about 75 percent among 16 Japanese lenders.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE COUP;
Britain to Assemble Group of 7 for Soviet Aid Talks

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Prime Minister John Major will convene senior officials of seven leading industrial nations next week to discuss what might be done to further economic and political reform in the Soviet Union, a spokesman for Mr. Major said today.
Mr. Major called the meeting after the failure of the coup by Soviet hard-liners opposed to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Mr. Major is now chairman of the Group of Seven, which includes the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Britain. 
 No date or place was set for the meeting, although officials at Downing Street said they expected it would take place in London.
In July, Mr. Gorbachev met with President Bush, Mr. Major and the other five leaders in London, where the seven promised to give the Soviet Union increased trade and technical assistance but stopped short of direct economic aid.
 
Major's Vow to Gorbachev
 Western leaders said at the time that the Soviet Union had to demonstrate a stronger commitment to real structural reform in the Soviet economy and political system.
But on Thursday, after Mr. Gorbachev had been restored to power and the coup attempt toppled, British officials said that Mr. Major had promised President Gorbachev that he would do whatever he could to speed up the Soviet leader's reform agenda.
He promised Mr. Gorbachev he would speak on the telephone with other Group of Seven leaders, to help shape a joint response to the new situation in the Soviet Union, a British official said.
A Downing Street spokesman said today that the talks next week are intended to "discuss and assess the situation in the Soviet Union and to carry matters forward."
Until now, Britain, like the United States, has ruled out direct cash assistance to the Soviet Union in favor of technical aid and closer ties to international agencies like the World Bank.
 
Aid Rise From Europe Sought
 Other nations, like Germany, have pushed for a stronger commitment to economic assistance.
Earlier today, the European Community said the Soviet Ambassador to Brussels had passed on a message from Mr. Gorbachev, requesting that President Jacques Delors provide a "significant increase" in the community's aid to Moscow.
British officials said the meeting next week definitely would consist of senior technical officials who have no power of their own to make decisions but rather report back to their capitals.
 
GERMANS URGE TALKS ON SOVIETS
BONN, Aug. 23 (Special to The New York Times) -- German officials today urged leaders of other industrial nations to convene a special meeting to discuss new help for the Soviet Union.
"The aid from the West must be as massive as the aid from Germany has been so far," said Economics Minister Jurgen Mollemann. "The past few days should have provided enough motivation."
In a radio interview and subsequent news conference, Mr. Mollemann suggested that leaders of the world's seven leading industrial powers, who met last month in London, should reassemble with President Gorbachev and leaders of Soviet republics.
"If a new summit were called," he said, "and the Soviet republics were given a greater role, then we could go beyond general declarations of intent and agree on a specific course."
At such a meeting, Mr. Mollemann said, the Soviet Union would be expected to present "a reform policy worthy of the name" that breaks decisively with "old Communist thinking."
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said he supported the call for a new Group of Seven meeting. He also urged that European Community leaders hold a separate meeting with leaders of formerly Communist countries in Eastern Europe. Such a meeting, he said, would be "the right signal" for countries worried about the durability of their new friendships with the West.
Although Mr. Mollemann declined to name countries that he believed were not contributing enough to the Soviet Union, Mr. Genscher singled out the United States and Japan.
Germany has provided more than $30 billion in aid to the Soviet Union since 1989.
Germany's economy, also burdened with the high costs of German unification, can no longer support such massive outlays. Yet Germans are convinced that without a large and immediate infusion of cash, the Soviet Union is headed for more instability.
"Supporting the development of democracy in the Soviet Union is not only in the interest of the Soviet Union, but of all the world's nations," said Dieter Vogel, chief spokesman for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, at a news conference today. "We need a comprehensive plan involving all Western industrial countries. It can't be only Germany."

Sweeping Away the Old Order
 SHAKEUP IN THE KREMLIN: President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, yielding to the ascendancy of the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, in the aftermath of the failed coup, replaced the Soviet Government. Page 1. 
 ROUT FOR THE COMMUNISTS: The Communist Party, for decades the bulwark of the Soviet state, was put to a humiliating rout, as party bosses and organizations across the country either defected or were locked out of their offices. Page 1.
SOBERING TIME FOR GORBACHEV: President Gorbachev's appearance before the Russian Parliament was meant as a show of gratitude and solidarity. But he often seemed less a President returned to power than a co-conspirator in the dock of a political tribunal. Page 1.
OLD-LINE PAPERS SUSPENDED: President Yeltsin ordered the suspension of Pravda and five other Communist Party newspapers and the seizure of their property on the territory of his Russian republic. Page 8.
 
Shock Waves in the Republics
LENIN'S DEMISE IN ESTONIA: The people of Estonia's capital, Tallinn, flocked to Communist Party headquarters. They stood there and laughed, staring at the empty pedestal from which a statue of Lenin had just been removed. Page 1.
CELEBRATION IN LITHUANIA: Lithuanians, sensing that full independence could be at hand, turned a rally commemorating the Nazi-Soviet pact that propelled them into the Soviet Union into a candle-lit celebration. There were anti-Communist actions in other republics as well. Page 8.
 
An Awed World Reacts
PRAISE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE: President Bush said the Soviet Union was moving rapidly toward "the objectives that we want" and praised the Government shakeup in Moscow. Page 9.

HEADLINE: Tax War, the Sequel, May Play in Connecticut

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Almost the only sounds in the Capitol today, finally still after its 53-day budget siege, were the first threats of Election-Day revenge against legislators who voted for a Connecticut income tax.
Those noises echo the great protest of 1971, when angry voters forced the repeal of a newly enacted income tax. In the weeks before smaller paychecks end the abstract nature of this debate and possibly amplify the rumblings, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and others bound to the tax can only hope that the storm will be swift in passing and that events will prove them right. 
 The immediate challenge for his independent administration, and for the Democrats and Republicans who supported him, is withstanding the protests until Mr. Weicker's long-term solution to the state's financial problems has a chance to be proved wise through long-term results.
Today Mr. Weicker offered a matter-of-fact resolve to weather any public storm, now that he had won the tax and budget he wanted from the General Assembly. "This is not a popularity contest, and I think everyone understood that from Day One," he said. "We're either right or wrong."
On a day when radio talk shows were crowded with callers complaining about the income tax and a taxpayers' group released its first list of legislators it plans to punish for voting for the tax, Mr. Weicker went so far as to say he saw no need to appeal for public support.
An income tax had been openly debated for months, he said, and no one is ever happy about paying more taxes. Instead, he presented the same blunt implacable logic with which he shaped the long tax debate in the Legislature.
"I'm not a tax reformer," he said. "I'm not an income-tax man." The tax question, he said, had been "driven by the numbers," budget numbers that did not add up in the end without the added, predictable revenue of an income tax.
Others, however, say a long education process is needed, both to make residents understand their share of the new tax and to make clear the alternatives. In some cases, that process can be as simple as guiding someone through a tax chart. In others, it may require either a sophisticated grasp of economics or a leap of faith.
"I suppose everyone is doing their own calculations today to see what they will pay as a family, and I guess they're going to have to wait to see if the price is worth it," said John J. Droney Jr., who as state Democratic chairman opposed an income tax while a majority of his legislators voted for it.
The long budget deadlock was fired by a series of emotional debating points, and in the short term, those points may strike home soon for people finding their paychecks reduced by tax withholding.
Opponents, for example, objected to using a tax on wages to cut taxes on business; Mr. Weicker argued that the state's high business taxes had to be cut to stimulate the economy and save jobs. Business interests supported the Governor without swaying any of the votes of their usual allies in the Legislature.
Business is generally pleased with the budget, which will cut business taxes, cuts spending this year and includes controls on future spending, said Peter M. Gioia, the director of research for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, which represents 6,600 businesses in the state.
 
Just 3 Votes
 The education process, from the association's perspective, involves the argument that the tax on salaries may save people's jobs. "Many of our members have not been able to give pay raises or have given much smaller pay raises than in the past because they are struggling to survive," he said. "Others have left the state."
If opponents to the income tax argue that it will hurt consumer spending, he said, "Losing your job, or fear of losing your job, does that a lot more."
More immediate concerns make Representative Richard Foley Jr., the state Republican chairman, say he believes there is a good chance of a strong tax protest developing in the next several months. First of all, he said, the margin of victory for such a major shift in taxes was razor thin: 3 votes out of the 187 members of the House and Senate.
"The entire political world now revolves around three votes," he said.
Just as important, he said, were the drawn-out fights over local budgets this spring and summer, as towns and cities faced their own budget crises. In one case, a regional school district had to put budgets to nine referendums before winning approval.
"If you don't want to pay an extra $50 or $100 in your local property tax," Mr. Foley said, "you're not going to be happy paying an additional $1,000 in income tax."
Mr. Weicker may have the luxury of standing firm against public protests, giving his budget time to prove its soundness. In any case, he early on declared his willingness to be a one-term governor.
But Democrats, who provided most of the votes for the income tax, face a more complicated challenge. Even though many Democrats joined Republicans in opposing the tax to the end, their party is likely to be identified with it.
 
Making Sure It Works
 That puts Democrats in the position of arguing that they showed courage and leadership when it was needed, and of doing what is necessary in the next year to make sure Mr. Weicker's budget achieves its goals.
"The party has to make sure this system works," Mr. Droney said. "They have to be prepared to take another look at it next year. They have to be ever vigilant that they don't spend any more, that they don't raise any more taxes. And they have to be prepared to take the credit for doing a difficult job under difficult circumstances."

HEADLINE: 4 Shoe Plants in Missouri to Close

BYLINE: By AP

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Aug. 23

 BODY:
The Brown Shoe Company, the nation's leading maker of women's shoes, said today that it would close four plants in Missouri and lay off 1,400 factory workers within three months. The St. Louis-based company cited the recession and the shift to imported shoes.
Brown, founded in 1878 and the maker of the Buster Brown line of shoes for children, said it had watched imported shoes gradually take over the women's shoe industry in the United States. 
 "The impact of free-market politics on small factory towns in Missouri has been devastating, as imported women's shoes now claim well over 90 percent of the market," said B. A. Bridgewater, chairman, president and chief executive of Brown.
Brown said it had closed 23 plants since 1970. It now has 22 -- 13 in Missouri, 5 in Tennessee, 1 in Arkansas and 3 in Canada -- and employs 9,000 workers.

HEADLINE: Rise in Durable Orders Is Steepest in 21 Years

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23

 BODY:
New orders to factories for long-lasting goods leaped 10.7 percent in July, the biggest increase in nearly 21 years, the Commerce Department said today.
The orders for durable goods are a leading but erratic indicator of the nation's investment spending and industrial production. Economists cautiously greeted today's unexpectedly strong increase as an indication that the economy may be in less danger of slipping back into a recession only a few months after it began growing again. 
 "A lot of people think we were poised for a double-dip recession, and these figures really negate that," said Marilyn C. Schaya, a money market economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a New York investment bank.
 
Interest Rates Climb
 The stock market rallied on the encouraging report, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 32.87 points to a new high of 3,040.25. But concern that the evidence of economic strength might lead to higher inflation sent prices of Treasury securities plummeting and interest rates climbing. [Page 47.]
The good news on durable goods overshadowed reports from auto makers that sales of domestically built cars and light trucks fell 10.2 percent in mid-August. [Page 40.]
Still, Mrs. Schaya and other economists cautioned that durable goods orders were among the most volatile statistics that the Commerce Department issues, and that the July increase followed a 1 percent decrease in June.
The surge of orders in July could be followed by a 5 or 6 percent drop in August because so many orders for needed products have now been placed, but the long-term trend has been one of solid monthly increases, said Thomas F. Carpenter, the chief economist at ASB Capital Management, a money management company in Washington.
The July rise in orders, which had been expected to be as small as 1 or 2 percent, "is going to mean that probably starting on Monday we're all going to come to work with a higher growth rate in mind," he added.
Gordon R. Richards, an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, said the July surge was unlikely to be repeated in the coming months. But he added that together with other recent economic data, "what it suggests is businesses are retooling in expectation of stable growth."
 
Some Weakness Indicated
 Despite the strength of the July orders, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates in order to curb the possibility of inflation heating up, Mr. Richards and other economists said. The Fed has tended to avoid reacting to any single monthly indicator, and some other economic statistics, including an early August jump in the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits, have indicated some weakness in the recovery.
Inflation has been easing, and that gave the Fed the room it needed earlier this month to lower short-term interest rates. The Fed appears to be following a policy now that favors holding rates steady or reducing them to keep the nascent recovery going.
Durable goods, as defined by the Commerce Department, are manufactured items that last more than three years, and include everything from filing cabinets to aircraft carriers. Much of the volatility of the orders stems from the inclusion of transportation and military equipment contracts that tend to be very large but are sporadic and reflect production that may be spread out over many years.
New orders for transportation equipment soared 24.5 percent in July after rising only 4.4 percent in June and shrinking 2.5 percent in May. New military equipment orders climbed 17.1 percent in July after dropping 12.7 percent in June.
 
Categories Partly Overlap
 The Commerce Department's categories for transportation and military equipment orders partly overlap, so that it is difficult to calculate the increase in all other goods, which may be a better indicator of overall investment spending. Mrs. Schaya of Donaldson, Lufkin said the increase was between 5 and 7 percent, however, depending on how much overlap is assumed.
The Commerce Department said that excluding just transportation, the orders still rose a strong 6 percent. Excluding just military orders, orders rose 10.3 percent.
The large increase announced today was consistent with recent industrial production statistics showing a strong revival this year of the American manufacturing sector, said John D. Mueller, the chief economist at Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon Inc., a financial consulting firm in Arlington, Va. The Federal Reserve announced on Aug. 16 that output from the nation's factories, mines and utilities grew in July for the fourth straight month.
 
Smallest in Eight Years
 The Commerce Department announced the same day that the trade deficit in June was only $4.02 billion, the smallest amount in eight years. Much of the improvement in the trade deficit has come as the deficit in manufactured goods has withered in the last two years.
The July increase in new orders for durable goods was the largest such rise since an 11.2 percent gain in December 1970. New orders totaled $129.9 billion, up $12.6 billion from June.
There were increases last month in all of the durable goods sectors that the Commerce Department tracks, except for lumber and wood products. Orders of nonmilitary capital goods, which consist heavily of factory equipment to make other products, rose 21.5 percent.
New orders for electronic and other electrical equipment climbed 12.6 percent last month after a 9.1 percent drop in June.
These figures show that American businesses are replenishing their inventories, another indication that the nation's executives are feeling confident that the recession may be over, Mr. Carpenter of ASB Capital Management said.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE COUP;
Radicals' Proud Moment

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Boris N. Yeltsin and his minions were riding high on their victory today, grilling a humbled Mikhail S. Gorbachev, shaping the composition of the next Government, shutting down hostile newspapers and suspending the Russian Communist Party.
But even as they savored the spoils of a decisive victory over a system that had resisted them so long, it was far from clear that their ascendance would translate into the radical transformation of Soviet society that has been their goal. 
 The lesson of anti-Communist revolutions past was that the sweet taste of victory was inevitably followed by the bitter reassertion of hard realities. The fall of the Berlin wall was followed by the bankruptcy of eastern Germany. Czechoslovakia faced dismemberment, Romania remained chaotic.
 
New Dangers
 And this country, whether under the restored Russian tricolor or the hammer and sickle, was still a beggared land with only a marginal experience of democracy, a widely divided populace and an economy in tatters.
There were new dangers, too: Mr. Gorbachev was still capable of applying brakes to radical reform. A newly ascendant Russian leadership stood to touch off a wave of seperatism. The window of opportunity opened by the failed coup could rapidly close when the hangover sets in.
Mr. Yeltsin himself was setting questionable precedents by decreeing the closing of newspapers and suspending the Russian Communist Party, and the anti-Communist fervor underscored the weakness of the fledgling democratic institutions. Mr. Yeltsin's following had been united largely in opposition to the Communists, and it could yet splinter under the pressure of hard decisions.
For now, in the immediate aftermah of the ignominious collapse of the old commissars' coup, there seemed no limit to the possibilities before the victorious collection of reformers, nationalists, intellectuals and democrats ranged behind the burly back of Mr. Yeltsin.
 
Gorbachev Isolated
 The K.G.B. was under siege, the military was docile, the police were under a Yeltsinite, the Communist Party no longer had the wherewithal to resist the long-gathering fury of the nation and President Gorbachev was isolated.
But even as the victors celebrated, the challenges were evident.
There was Mr. Gorbachev. Brought before the Russian Parliament in what was meant as a show of gratitude and solidarity for his deliverance by the Russian leaders, he soon came to appear less a president than a co-conspirator in the dock at a political tribunal.
Though he repeatedly said "we reformers" and spoke of the need to maintain unity "in the ranks of democrats," he made clear he was not prepared to cast his lot unequivocally with the radical reformers.
He talked of continuing with his Government's weak economic program, he maneuvered to keep his own people in Government, he defended the "peasants, workers and intelligentsia" of the Communist Party, and he sought to depict the coup as aimed against him personally and not as an onslaught by the system with which he had been allied and organized by those he had appointed.
Soon heckling spread through the hall, and Mr. Yeltsin, openly asserting his power over an old rival, repeatedly prompted and corrected Mr. Gorbachev, even ordering him in prosecutorial tones to read out notes from a closed meeting of the Council of Ministers at which minister after minister was revealed to have embraced the state of emergency or condoned it.
The sparring suggested that even if the balance of forces had dramatically tilted toward Mr. Yeltsin, a new relationship had yet to take shape between the old rivals and Mr. Gorbachev was not yet ready to assume a ceremonial role.
And for all of Mr. Yeltsin's new authority, Mr. Gorbachev still commanded considerable powers as federal President, capable at least of impeding the passage of that with which he disagreed.
That possibility alarmed advocates of radical reform who believed that the moment had to be seized immediately if it was not to be lost.
 
'Ready Now to Accept Sacrifice'
 "People who stood three nights in the rain to protect Yeltsin are ready now to accept sacrifice," argued Sergei A. Zverev, a member of the economic research center led by the radical economist Grigory A. Yavlinsky, with whom Mr. Yeltsin had held vigil in the threatened Russian Parliament during the coup. "But the window will not be open forever."
The heckling of Mr. Gorbachev and the shouts of "resign, resign" as he drove away from the parliament testified to the mood of disappointed expectations.
It began on Wednesday night, when on his return from the Crimea Mr. Gorbachev did not come directly to the Russian Parliament where the resistance to the coup was centered. And it turned more sour over the full day that passed before he came.
"If he had come that night, we would have carried him on our shoulders," Mr. Zverev said. "Instead he started saying that he is still a Communist. He missed a great opportunity."
 
'He Is Lucky He Survived'
 Mr. Gorbachev's performance was also seen as a failure to appreciate the real significance of the coup.
"What Mikhail Sergeyevich failed to understand is that all his power and the power of the bureaucracy is supported by four whales -- the military industrial complex, the K.G.B., the army and the bureaucracy," said Dr. Vyacheslav Fyodorov, a prominent eye surgeon and a Russian deputy.
"Until he destroys them, not without our help, his power is ephemeral. Any moment, as soon as he stops serving them, they will wipe him out. He is lucky that he survived. But instead of eliminating the chance of a repetition, he is dreaming of some strange reformation."
Yet if Mr. Gorbachev disappointed the Yeltsinites by affirming old socialist loyalty and clinging to old programs, the newly ascendant forces had yet to shape their own clear agenda. Mr. Yeltsin had adopted for Russia a version of the radical "500-day" economic program that Mr. Gorbachev had earlier rejected. But until the new union treaty became binding, he still lacked the levers or powers to put it in effect.
 
Dangers in the Streets
 The other potential dangers rose from the streets. Though a wave of anti-Communist fervor was inevitable in the heat of the moment, it was only Mr. Gorbachev who cautioned that the passions undermined the political tolerance that the reformers had so ardently demanded.
Mr. Yeltsin, instead of urging caution, seemed to fan the flames by closing down hostile Communist newspapers and demonstratively signing a decree to suspend the Russian Communist Party while Mr. Gorbachev was still at the podium.
Beyond that was the repeated claim of victory for the Russian republic. One of the disclosures at the parliament session was that Mr. Gorbachev had agreed that the federal Prime Minister would always be a Russian citizen, and that news, combined with the vast new influence of the Russian Government on the Kremlin, seemed likely to fan secessionist sentiments in the other republics.
And yet, arrayed against all these challenges was the sense that the people had finally overcome what had been the major obstacles to real freedom and real change.
For all the dangers and threats inherent in a time of revolutionary change, a nation that was despairing of its ability to finally shake off its 70-year yoke had finally done it, and that at a moment when it desperately required a morale boost.
"If we could do this," argued an engineer outside the Russian Parliament, "I think we can do the rest."

Markets
Stock prices soared to new heights on the heels of a surprisingly robust durable goods report. The Dow vaulted to a record 3,040.25, up 32.87 for the day and 72.23 for the week. While Wednesday's huge run-up, which put the Dow within striking range of the summit, was Wall Street's sigh of relief at the turn of Soviet events, this rally was clearly built on the strength of domestic data. [39.] 
 The credit market was sent reeling by an extremely strong reading on the economy, and prices of Treasury securities plummeted in moderately active trading. [47.]
The dollar moved sharply higher, helped by the report on orders for durable goods. [48.]
Coffee futures prices spurted higher amid rumors of a halt in Brazilian exports. [48.]
 
 The Economy
The F.D.I.C.'s financial condition is weaker than previously estimated, and the deposit insurance agency will need additional money from the Government within a few months, the G.A.O. said. By the end of the year, the bank insurance fund "will likely be insolvent" but will still have the cash needed to pay depositors of failed banks, the accounting office said. [39.]
New orders for durable goods leaped 10.7 percent in July, the biggest increase in nearly 21 years, the Commerce Department said. The durable-goods number is a leading but erratic indicator of investment spending and industrial production, and economists saw the report as a sign that the economy may be in less danger of slipping back into recession. [39.]
As the economy limps out of a recession, a spurt of layoffs, hiring freezes and corporate mergers is hitting some of the biggest engines of the 80's expansion: service companies, government and high-tech manufacturing. [39.]
Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks fell 10.2 percent in mid-August, reflecting somewhat weaker demand in the U.S. auto market than analysts had expected. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales from Aug. 11 to 20 was 6.1 million. [40.]
Federal Reserve policy makers voted last month to maintain a neutral monetary policy that did not favor further interest-rate cuts to stimulate the economy, minutes of their meeting show. [42.]
 
 Companies
The Salomon scandal has ended another executive's career with the firm. Donald M. Feuerstein, the firm's chief legal counsel, resigned under pressure from Warren E. Buffett. [39.]
American Isuzu Motors awarded its estimated $90 million advertising account to Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein in one of the summer's most closely followed reviews. [39.]
P. A. Bergner filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The operator of Carson Pirie Scott, Bergner's and Boston Store cited its high debt and declining sales. [41.]
NCNB's proposed acquisition of C&S/Sovran was a triumphant event for Charlotte, N.C., a city with a historic longing for recognition. [10.]
Citicorp said it was negotiating the sale to Bertelsmann of a vacant 42-story office tower in Manhattan, probably at a loss. [28.]
 
 International
Brazil's Government, desperate to stave off fiscal collapse and runaway inflation, wants radical changes to the Constitution to rein in spending, raise taxes and encourage investment. [42.]
The U.S. will give China a second chance to reduce its import barriers instead of starting an inquiry that could lead to mandatory trade sanctions, the Bush Administration announced. [40.]

HEADLINE: AFTER THE COUP;
Ever-Faster Flow of Events In Moscow Are Joy to Bush

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 23

 BODY:
President Bush said today that the Soviet Union was moving more rapidly toward "the objectives that we want," and he praised the Government shake-up in Moscow, which reversed decisions that had drawn criticism on Thursday from the Bush Administration.
"The people appear to be moving toward the objectives of United States foreign policy and, in the process, toward democracy, freedom, self-determination -- all of these things," Mr. Bush said, adding, "Clearly, we are in extraordinary times." 
 In another astonishing day in which American officials watched events unfold at a pace that exceeded their most optimistic expectations, the Administration was starting to come to grips with the certainty that the old formulas of power in the Soviet Union, and thus that country's relationship with the outside world, would change.
That will likely mean changes in American policies, including decisions about increasing economic aid, revising Washington's relationships with the republics and a reassessment of its cautious stand on the Baltic independence movement. The President will be pressed on economic aid in two meetings here next week with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada and Prime Minister John Major of Britain.
Mr. Bush refused to comment today on the individual appointments made by the Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian Federation.
As Mr. Bush finished the first of two rounds of golf today, he said, "It's not for me or anybody else in my Administration to make a lot of comments each time there's a personnel change."
On Thursday, aides said Mr. Bush had been annoyed by news reports about his Administration's concerns on Mr. Gorbachev's decisions to appoint or retain several officials regarded by Washington as Soviet hard-liners or members of the conspiracy to overthrow the Soviet President.
Today, Mr. Bush, who is always careful not to be seen as criticizing the actions of other world leaders with whom he does business, and especially of Mr. Gorbachev, ordered his staff not to comment on the upheaval in the Soviet Government.
On Thursday a senior Administration official had sharply criticized Mr. Gorbachev for appointing General Mikhail A. Moiseyev as Defense Minister. American officials said the General may have played a part in the attempted coup. They said they were relieved today when he was replaced by Col. Gen. Yevgeny I. Shaposhnikov, but they were careful not to comment about the shift in public.
"We just can't indulge in that," Mr. Bush said, expressing annoyance at reporters who asked him to comment on the events in Moscow.
But Mr. Bush said movement toward democracy seemed to be accelerating in the Soviet Union. "I think when we see that enormous outpouring of democracy, for democracy, and the enormous support for freedom, it's bound to be a manifestation of the real will of the people there, and that is all very positive," he said.
Mr. Bush also shrugged off Mr. Gorbachev's defense of the Communist Party. He said: "As you know, there are many reformers that have stayed in the party. There are many that have left. And I think what's more important than labels is what kind of performance we see from now on."
But Administration officials said the President and his advisers had been disappointed to watch Mr. Gorbachev proclaim his continued allegiance to the party on Thursday. Today, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said in an interview broadcast on the Cable News Network that Mr. Gorbachev's loyalty to the party "doesn't indicate at this stage that he's grasped the reality of the need to reform and reform quickly."
While officials here said they could not predict the course of events in the Soviet Union, including the political longevity of Mr. Gorbachev himself, they said they were unconcerned about any changes in Soviet foreign policy.
Officials said they did not expect the dismissal of Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh to sour the new sense of cooperation in Soviet-American foreign relations. If anything, they said, they expected Soviet foreign policy to be even more to Washington's liking as democratic change accelerates in the Soviet Union.
Mr. Bessmertnykh had been a major player in the Soviet-American peacemaking effort in the Middle East, particularly the complicated diplomacy and negotiations that led to the plan in July to hold an Arab-Israeli peace conference. There had been speculation that his departure could complicate those efforts.
 
Call From Bessmertnykh
 But Mr. Bush said, "No, I don't think it means all that." He said that Mr. Bessmertnykh had telephoned Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d this morning to tell him he was resigning at Mr. Gorbachev's request, and that Mr. Bessmertnykh "told Baker it had no implications" for the Middle East peace process.
Administration officials took pains to say there would be no immediate major changes in American policy toward the Soviet Union while that country was sorting out its political future. Mr. Bush's initial public silence today was intended, in part, to avoid saying anything that could complicate Mr. Gorbachev's efforts to find a new accommodation with Mr. Yeltsin and the leaders of the other republics.
But the United States is going to be hard-pressed to stick to its refusal to increase financial aid to Moscow if the current upheaval produces real progress toward free-market reforms. Mr. Mulroney, who arrives on Sunday for an overnight stay, and Mr. Major, who will be here on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, have called for greater economic assistance to the Soviet Union.
The significant increase in the powers of Mr. Yeltsin is also forcing the United States to confront more squarely the issue of how it will deal with the Soviet republics. Mr. Bush has already acknowledged that his relationship with Mr. Yeltsin has changed significantly.
The lightning pace of events today did produce at least one subtle shift in American policy.
Mr. Bush and his aides had moved quickly on Thursday to put some pressure on the newly reinstated Mr. Gorbachev to move forward with political and economic changes. But by today, those efforts had largely ceased.
 
'They're Doing It for Us'
 "We don't have to do anything because they're doing it for us," one official said. "Yeltsin's firing people and shutting down party offices and Gorbachev is going along with it."
Officials said it was becoming increasingly clear that Mr. Gorbachev must go along with the tide of change in his country and then find some way to gain control of it, or risk being swept away by it.
"Brushed aside may be too strong right now, but either Gorbachev is going to take the lead in the reform process or his position is going to become very much weaker very fast," one official said. He added, "That may happen anyway."
Another official said Mr. Gorbachev's post as President of the Soviet Union was in danger of "becoming irrelevant."
The official said: "I think what you have in response to the attempted coup is a true revolution, political revolution, and very likely the death throes of the party. And the bottom line is that Yeltsin clearly has the upper hand in this."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE COUP;
The 3 New Top Security Appointees

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:

Vadim V. Bakatin
Chairman of K.G.B. 
 Vadim V. Bakatin, who takes over the K.G.B. without any known background in the intelligence and internal security agency, is among the most liberal figures in the Soviet leadership. His appointment appears to presage a major overhaul of the agency and the dismantling of much of its secret police operations, American officials say.
Administration officials expressed enthusiasm for Mr. Bakatin's appointment, characterizing him as a man of great intelligence and candor who has repeatedly shown loyalty to the cause of reform even when his progressiveness stood in the way of his career advancement.
Mr. Bakatin had been one of the main proponents of glasnost and perestroika until he was dismissed as Interior Minister late last year during a resurgence of the right in the Communist Party. He is known as an proponent of due process of law and of radical economic reforms, including the attraction of foreign investment and the steady elimination of subsidies and price controls.
"He is going to clean up the K.G.B., no doubt about it," said an Administration official who monitors Soviet intelligence agencies. "He'll get rid of the cowboys and insist the K.G.B. follows the law."
 
Promoted U.S. Exchanges
 As Interior Minister, Mr. Bakatin promoted personnel exchanges between his ministry and the United States Justice Department, as well as between Soviet and American local police forces.
Condoleezza Rice, a political scientist at Stanford University, said, "He sought out Western ideas on how police forces should behave in a democracy." Ms. Rice, who met Mr. Bakatin briefly last year when she served as a staff member in the National Security Council, said, "He is open and outgoing and easy to talk to."
A civil engineer by training, Mr. Bakatin comes to the K.G.B. as an outsider to the security force, although he has spent most of his career in law enforcement. As Interior Minister he worked closely with the K.G.B. fighting crime and corruption, but Western analysts said he had never been a member of the K.G.B. and had no known record of political repression.
Born in 1937 into a middle-class family in the Siberian coal mining town of Kiselevsk, Mr. Bakatin graduated from a technical institute and worked on several construction projects before he went to work for the Communist Party in the early 1960's.
 
Taste for Things Western
 He is known for his taste for things Western -- ranging from his love for tennis to a fondness for be-bop jazz, the Beatles and Elvis Presley.
Mr. Bakatin worked his way through the ranks of several regional party organs before he was promoted by Mr. Andropov to be an inspector of the Communist Party Central Committee. He returned to regional party work in 1985, serving as first secretary of the party in the cities of Kirov and Kemerovo.
His active support for Mr. Gorbachev led to his appointment as Interior Minister in 1990. Though he was removed from his post, he continued to serve as a member of the Soviet Security Council.
In an interview with the Soviet press in May, Mr. Bakatin identified himself as a "radical centrist."
Mr. Bakatin ran against Boris N. Yeltsin for President of the Russian federated republic, campaigning for even more radical change, but came in third place in the election.
 
Yevgeny I. Shaposhnikov
Defense Minister
 Col. Gen. Yevgeny I. Shaposhnikov, the new Defense Minister, had been commander of the Soviet Air Force, and his refusal to obey orders from the coup committee helped bring about its downfall.
One of his first acts as Defense Minister was to resign from the Communist Party.
Administration officials said they were pleased with General Shaposhnikov's appointment because he seemed to be the kind of officer who would support a sweeping reform of the Soviet economy and reducing the size of the Soviet military. In speeches over the last year, they said, he has argued in favor of giving priority to economic development as a matter of national security.
American officials compliment him for accepting the demise of the Warsaw Pact as a development that could not be avoided, and they say they believe that he will work to remove Communist Party influence from the armed forces. "He can be expected to move toward a smaller, more professional military," an Administration official said.
 
Approved by Yeltsin
 A State Department official said his appointment was approved by Mr. Yeltsin because "Yeltsin believes he will support what needs to be done to the military, a reduction in the size and a conversion to an all volunteer force."
Stephen Foye, an analyst of the Soviet military for Radio Free Europe, said General Shaposhnikov "is very forward-looking."
"He has spoken very favorably of increased competition in the defense industries," he said.
An American military intelligence official described the general as "hard-charging, a fighter pilot's fighter pilot." He reportedly works about 75 hours a week, but is also known for hard living, including chain smoking and hefty eating.
 
Unusually Young for Post
 At age 49, he is unusually young to have risen to the Soviet high command, a point American analysts make to explain his fresh approach to many issues. He was born in 1942 in a small Russian village to a working-class family. At age 21, he joined the Communist Party and graduated from the Kharkov Aviation Institute, after which he served as an air force pilot.
After serving in East Germany, he was appointed first deputy commander of the air force in 1988, and then was elected to a seat on the Communist Party Central Committee. He was promoted to air force commander in July 1990. His principal priorities for the service were better training and more efficient and economical equipment.
 
'Substantial Cuts' Seen
 "His appointment probably means a more rapid transition that could bring substantial cuts in the armed forces and less holding back by the old guard," he said.
General Shaposhnikov's ascendency does not mean that conservatives will no longer have a place in the military.
His new principal deputy, the General Staff chief, is Gen. Vladimir Lobov, a hard-liner who has long called on the Soviet Union to seek military superiority over the West. Last posted as Chief of Staff of the Warsaw Pact military alliance, he is one of the Soviet Union's leading strategic theorists. General Lobov, who is 56, has tended to bend his political philosophy with the leadership and has not overtly opposed President Gorbachev.
The new No. 3 man in the armed forces, the Deputy Defense Minister, is Lieut. Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, 43, a liberal. As commander of Soviet paratroops, he refused to deploy his forces in support of the coup committee this week. He served for five years in Afghanistan during the war, an experience that apparently made him skeptical about deploying military force abroad.
 
Viktor P. Barannikov
Interior Minister
 Viktor P. Barannikov, the new Interior Minister, is a close ally of Mr. Yeltsin, who has long worked to make the Russian police independent of the central Soviet authorities.
In his former post as chief of the Russian federation's Interior Ministry, Mr. Barannikov concentrated on criminal investigations and eradicated Communist Party cells from his agency. Administration officials said they expected him to continue his reform policies. "His priority will be to make an effective crime-fighting unit out of the Interior Ministry as opposed to an instrument of internal repression," an Administration official said.
Mr. Yeltsin promoted Mr. Barannikov, who at the time was first deputy minister of internal affairs in the Russian republic, to become the chief police officer in his Government late last year.
 
Least Known to Washington
 Of the new appointees, he is the least well known to the Bush Administration. A State Department official said it was not even known whether he is married or has children. He is believed to have been born in 1941, and he has been involved in regional and national police work since 1961.
American officials said they were pleased about his appointment because he struggled in his former post against hard-liners in the Soviet Interior Ministry who wanted to subordinate his agency. He insisted that the militia of the Russian federation be commanded by Mr. Yeltsin and not by Moscow.

HEADLINE: Devices That Try to Outwit Shoplifters

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Now you see them, now you don't. To protect their merchandise from shoplifters, retailers are using increasingly sophisticated security devices. Some are covert and designed to catch thieves; others are overt and designed to deter theft.
"One of the things that promotes shoplifting is the belief that it is not a consumer's problem," said Richard Feinberg, director of the Retail Institute at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. "But part of the price you pay for a suit is the cost to the store in dealing with shoplifting." 
 According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, there were 1.2 million shoplifting incidents reported last year, up from 1.1 million in 1989. Shoplifting now accounts for 16 percent of all reported larcenies.
Shrinkage, the term used by retailers to refer primarily to both shoplifting and thefts by employees, is equal to about 2 percent of sales in the average department store, according to the National Retail Federation, a trade association in New York. A third of all shrinkage is due to shoplifting. Next week, the federation and three other organizations will release the results of a survey on store security at the International Security Conference in New York.
 
Highest Rate: Accessories
 As might be expected, some store departments have a higher shrinkage rate than others. A loss-prevention survey by Ernst & Young, the accounting and consulting firm, shows that the highest rate, 7.6 percent, occurs in women's fashion accessories and costume jewelry, usually small items easily concealed and carried out of a store.
In contrast, the shrinkage rate for women's apparel is 2.4 percent; for men's apparel and shoes it is 1.8 percent. In hard goods, the shrinkage rate for records, compact disks and videotapes is 4.1 percent; for radios, televisions and stereos, it is 3.4 percent.
Among the reasons cited for shoplifting these days are the growth in the number of drug abusers, who steal to support their habit; the reduction in uniformed and plainclothes security guards and the fact that expensive items are more frequently displayed openly, said Peter Berlin, who heads a retail consulting company bearing his name in Jericho, L.I.
Paul Marcus, the chairman of Securus, an installer of security systems in Denver, mentioned another reason: the recession. "When times get tougher, people steal more," he said.
Although there are hundreds of devices that help stop shoplifting, like observation mirrors, three major categories of security devices are used: electronic article surveillance, closed-circuit television and cables attached to locks and chains. While equipment in each category has long been in use, improvements and new inventions are continually added to retailers' security systems.
 
Beeping Tags
 Electronic article surveillance refers to the security tags clamped to merchandise, typically clothing. If the tag is not removed by the cashier, it will make an alarm go off when the merchandise is carried past sensors at the store's exits. Versions of the tags emit a nonwashable ink that spreads over the garment if the tag is improperly removed either in or out of the store.
One of the newest devices is a tag made by the Sensormatic Electronics Corporation; it is called Tell Tag and it beeps when tampered with. The beeping activates an alarm, which may frighten off the shoplifter and also warns store employees that a shoplifter is at work.
Then there are weight-sensing devices that sound an alarm when merchandise is removed from or added to a shelf or rack.
For example, the Protron, made by Protex International, activates a recording that shoppers can hear -- "Someone will be with you in a moment," or something similar -- whenever an item weighing three ounces or more is added or removed from a display. The Protron also sends an electronic message to the nearest sales clerk that someone is at a particular display and should be watched.
Closed-circuit cameras -- seen or unseen, black and white or color, with or without videotape -- are also used by retailers. Most often, they hang from the ceiling in plastic spheres, but they also fit into track lighting and behind wall panels. Many cameras can tilt, zoom and pan, following a shopper -- or shoplifter -- when directed to do so.
Security experts disagree on the value of closed-circuit television in foiling shoplifting. Roger A. Speyer, president of the PSA Security Network in Denver, said security "is pretty much a function of observation and the most effective way to do that is by closed-circuit television."
But Kurt Barnard, who publishes Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, a newsletter in New York, thinks these systems are useful only when "somebody watches what the cameras sees, and someone isn't always watching the monitor."
Probably the most unusual housing for a closed-circuit camera is a mannequin called Anne Droid. Not only does it contain a camera behind its glass eyes, but a microphone can be mounted behind its nose to eavesdrop on conversations nearby.
Cable systems, some mechanical and some electronic, lock up the merchandise to prevent its removal. Some locking devices are incorporated in fixtures, displays or wall systems, while others use flexible cables to keep the items secure.

HEADLINE: Wichita Tires of Spotlight on Abortion Protesters

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WICHITA, Kan., Aug. 23

 BODY:
This heartland city of 300,000 people has grown weary, its normally sturdy shoulders and spirit beginning to sag under the weight of an unwelcome and unaccustomed national spotlight accompanying the disruptive anti-abortion demonstrations that began six weeks ago.
Such turmoil seems out of place in Wichita, a city of churches, minor league baseball and friendly people. While it has many of the problems of large cities, it is a good place to raise children, everyone from the hotel bellmen to the Mayor say. 
 And until July, it was best known for being the hub of light-aircraft manufacturing. In Detroit they make cars. In Wichita they make planes, the big three being the Boeing Company, the Cessna Aircraft Company and the Beech Aircraft Corporation.
It is also the birthplace of Pizza Hut and the White Castle hamburger, although the tiny White Castle sandwiches are not available here. The company left town years ago, said F. Tim Witsman, the president of Wichita's Chamber of Commerce.
 
Appeals Court Backs Judge
 But the protests, led by the militant anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, have put Wichita on the map.
"Nobody knew we were here before," the chamber's spokesman, Roger N. Wilson, said.
And today the protesters continued to defy a Federal judge by blocking the gates of one of the city's three abortion clinics. About 84 were arrested, pushing the total number of arrests to about 2,580.
The judge's order was upheld today by the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver. But the appeals court said it would hear arguments by the anti-abortion group against the judge's order that protesters post a $100,000 bond against property damage and his jailing of three of the leaders for failing to do so.
Residents here say they can not recall a time of such discontent on their streets, a time of divided families and congregations, of splintered friendships and shaken love.
Some here worry that the city's reputation has been badly injured at a time when it is struggling to polish its image and revive its dying downtown.
But abortion opponents say it gives prominence to their cause. Operation Rescue was drawn to Wichita in part by the fact that it is one of the only cities in which women can obtain abortions in the final three months of pregnancy.
Most seem to agree that the demonstrations have caused deep divisions, and while they look forward to a time of healing they do not know when that time will come.
The next 48 hours, some fear, could be the most volatile of this painful summer on the Kansas prairie.
Thousands of people on both sides of the fight over abortion are scheduled to converge on the city this weekend for rallies, separated only by a day and a few blocks.
 
Fear of 'a Lot of Trouble'
 It is a prospect that makes Steven A. Smith, the managing editor of The Wichita Eagle, nervous.
"Because of the proximity of the rallies in both time and location, I'm just worried that some wacko from either side is going to do something that will start a lot of trouble," he said.
The protests began on July 15. Since then, hundreds of abortion opponents have been in and out of the city.
But this weekend will be the first time a significant number of out-of-town supporters of the clinics are expected to be here.
So far there have been no serious confrontations between the two sides, a glimmer of hope the city's leaders quickly point to when discussing the impact of the summer of protests and the coming rallies.
"There's been no bloodshed," said Mr. Wilson of the chamber of commerce. "It's been handled. People around the country will say, 'O.K. Wichita had its trial by fire and it came through relatively unscathed.' This is just six weeks of nuisance."
 
'Very Severe' Effect
 But it has been much more than a nuisance to Celeste Holeman, 31 years old, and her friends at Bank IV in downtown Wichita.
"We talk about it just about every break time," Ms. Holeman said. "We've got a pro-lifer in our group. It gets pretty heated."
Another worker at the bank, Kathy Murphy, 23, said, "I think the whole thing has given us a lot of bad publicity we don't need."
Ms. Murphy said she had just returned from a recent trip through Missouri and several people there had asked her "are you from where all those abortionists are?"
"I'm getting tired of talking about it," she said.
Kelly Beltz, the 34-year-old manager of the Taco Tico fast-food resturant in downtown Wichita said the protests' impact had been "very severe."
"It's caused a lot of division in the community," he said. "It's an issue that has split families. It's split people who used to work well together. People who used to come in here in groups, now those groups are fragmented."
"As a businessman, I have to respect both sides," he said. "But I don't think this is doing us a damn bit of good. No positive footage has ever come out of a war zone. This has caused a lot ofwounds. I want to know who's going to be here to patch them up."
 
Plans to Leave Town
 Leaders of Operation Rescue say that after the weekend rally the organization will leave town, passing the baton to local residents.
Although the protests have overshadowed the city for weeks, there are other issues and concerns here like school reform and development.
The downtown area is struggling and appears nearly deserted after 5 P.M. The major department stores are long gone, their buildings largely abandoned.
There are gangs and drugs and drive-by shootings and a growing concern about public safety.
But the economy is healthy. The unemployment rate is 4.6 percent in the three-county Wichita area.
Mr. Witsman said that while much of the country was losing manufacturing jobs Wichita was not.
The hourly industrial wage in the city as of May averaged $12.49 compared to $11.15 nationwide. The high wages are largely due to the unionized aircraft plants. Overall, the city's work force is about 10 percent unionized.
Born as a trading post on the Chisholm Trail, Wichita grew into a rowdy cow town in the 1870's.
But the region filled with farms, and churches began to crowd out the saloons and brothels that had gained nationwide notoriety for the city. Wichita went through a series of boomtown phases -- milling, meatpacking, real estate, oil -- before settling into a pattern of quiet respectability.
Now that quiet has been shattered, and hundreds of people from across the country have arrived over the last few days for this weekend's rallies.
Supporters of a woman's right to choose to have an abortion will hold their rally first on Saturady in a park along the Big Arkansas River, which runs slowly through downtown. It is just blocks from a hotel where most of the out of town abortion opponents are staying.
The abortion opponents will hold their rally on Sunday.
The management of the local minor league team, the Wichita Wranglers, tried to do something to ease the tension a few weeks ago.
"There was a lot of tension in the city then, so we held a 'protesters night' out at the ball park," Brad Eldridge, the team's business manager, said the other night. "We invited all the protesters on both sides to lay down their signs and come on out and watch a game and relax."
About 100 people showed up for the free tickets.
Asked how the club knew they were real protesters, Mr. Eldridge said, "We took their word. This is Wichita."

HEADLINE: Banking Lifts Charlotte, City on the Rise, to the Top

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C., Aug. 23

 BODY:
This is still the home of the Billy Graham Parkway, the Charlotte Motor Speedway and the Jim Bakker fraud trials. Outsiders still confuse this city with Charleston to the south and Charlottesville to the north.
But when Charlotte woke up one day last month to find itself being touted as America's third largest banking center, displacing Los Angeles, it marked a historic juncture, not just for Charlotte but also for the South. From its glistening skyline and button-down corporate culture to its blend of big-time religion and civic boosterism, Charlotte's rise is very much the story of the rebirth of the South. 
 For Charlotte, the locally based NCNB Corporation's proposed acquisition of the C&S/Sovran Corporation of Atlanta to form a $118 billion bank that would operate in nine states would leave the city's banks with assets surpassed only by New York and San Francisco. It was a triumphant event for a city with a historic longing for recognition of almost any kind.
"When I came here in 1959 a cousin in Richmond told me Charlotte's a wonderful place," said Thomas Storrs, NCNB's chairman emeritus and the predecessor of the current chairman, Hugh McColl Jr. "She said the best way to summarize Charlotte is to say that if the Russians bomb us and the first wave of bombs that comes over doesn't include one for Charlotte, they will be very much disappointed."
 
A Psychological Landmark
 For the South, long forced to go elsewhere for capital, the merger that will form what is to be called Nationsbank is both an economic and a psychological landmark. With last week's proposed merger of the San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corporation and the Security Pacific Corporation, Nationsbank would be the nation's fourth largest bank, after Citicorp, BankAmerica and Chemical, which announced its merger with Manufacturers Hanover last month.
"Charlotte fundamentally has not had a new idea in 120 years, and that's not necessarily a criticism," said Dan Morrill, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. "It's been wanting the Yankees to recognize that we're not second-class citizens, that we are people of prestige and power and influence, and we have truly risen again. They've been saying that ever since the 1870's, and now it is clearly beginning more and more to be the truth."
Charlotte, the seat of Mecklenburg County, was incorporated in 1768 and named for Queen Charlotte, the wife of King George III of England. Its economy grew first with gold, discovered in 1799, then cotton, and then companies serving the textile industry.
Charlotte's modern history bears an uncanny resemblance to that of Atlanta, long considered the dominant city of the South. Both grew as lushly wooded railroad crossroads. Both had local editors, Henry Grady in Atlanta and D. A. Tompkins in Charlotte, who preached a gospel of New South economic development.
Both cities grew as commercial and financial centers not dependent on a single industry. Both prided themselves on the degree to which business and government worked together. And both, seeing integration as inevitable and civic strife as bad for business, integrated peacefully under the leadership of the city's business elites.
"Charlotte achieves its meaning primarily from what it aspires to be, not what it's been, and I think the same is true of Atlanta," Professor Morrill said. "If somebody moved from Atlanta to Charlotte, they could take up life without even missing a beat."
The difference between them was that Atlanta's railroad connections were better, and its drum beating and entrepreneurial zeal established it as the South's commercial center; until recently Charlotte played the same role only for the textile belt of the Carolinas.
The population of Charlotte, 417,621 after a recent annexation, now exceeds Atlanta's, which the 1990 census put at 394,017. But the Atlanta metropolitan area of 2.8 million people, the nation's 12th largest, is more than twice the size of Charlotte's 1.2 million.
 
A Powerhouse in Banking
 There is one area, however, where Charlotte has long had an edge on Atlanta. Because of North Carolina's liberal banking laws, which allowed banks to form networks of branches throughout the state, its banks became powerhouses first across North Carolina and then branched out into lucrative markets like Florida and Texas.
It is difficult to be sure whether the hardheaded dynamism of the banks created the city or whether the pro-business tradition created the banks. But what has emerged is a prosperous city that mirrors the culture of the emerging cities of the South.
The current recession has cooled the explosive growth that left Charlotte with an unemployment rate of 2.9 percent in 1989 and 3 percent in 1990. Unemployment now stands at 5.5 percent. While the city's economy generally remains healthy, the slowdown has deflated some of the sense of invulnerability that Charlotte took on in the last 15 years, when companies like I.B.M. flocked here.
Like Atlanta or Dallas, Charlotte is not shaped by a river or port or any other defining force of geography. Nor does it carry the grand history of Charleston, New Orleans or the other early urban powers of the South. Instead, it has become almost the generic New South city, with its endless expanse of neat subdivisions, poor black neighborhoods largely out of sight, and a downtown of designer skyscrapers, bustling by day, deserted at night. Instead of geography or history, it is dominated by the two enduring forces of the South -- commerce and religion.
 
A Presbyterian Heritage
 "Religion really plays a remarkable role in Charlotte, more so in Charlotte than any city in which I've lived," said the Rev. Bill Wood, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, the oldest of about 440 churches in the city, more than 400 of them Protestant.
"That Presbyterian -- really sort of Calvinistic -- heritage has been part of the city," Mr. Wood continued. "I think all of us will say there's an element of greed and materialism that runs strong in our contemporary culture, and we're not isolated from that. But I think that's tempered by a sense to use wealth and power in constructive ways, as well as just sort of self-aggrandizement. And I think that happens for the most part in Charlotte."
One result is a high degree of unanimity, whether in seeking sports franchises like the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association, backing the public schools, luring industry or building inner-city housing. Another is a fixation on the city's image, from deciding to give the city's downtown the more perky appellation of "uptown," or being sure visitors know that the Bakker trials were held here but that the disgraced evangelist conducted his business just over the border in South Carolina.
Ever alert to marketing possibilities, Charlotte has come up with a figure indicating that while its population ranks 33d among the nation's cities, the 5.7 million people living within a 100-mile radius of the city make it the nation's fifth largest urban area.
At its best, as in the effort to desegregate schools that has made them among the most integrated in the country, Charlotte's aspirations have produced a city that seems to work in places where others fail.
"The people who come here want to make it work," said Harvey Gantt, the black architect who failed to unseat Senator Jesse Helms last year but who was twice elected mayor of a city that is more than 70 percent white.
"You have an unusual culture where there's a strong relationship between business and government," the former Mayor said. "The ethic of this town is hard work and the idea that anyone can go anywhere if they work hard enough."
 
'It's a City of Babbitts'
 To others, the flip side of the city's aggressiveness is a place that struts too much and crows too loudly, particularly when it is bragging about being "international" and "world class," the mantras of every up-and-coming American city.
"Charlotte is 90 percent foam and 10 percent beer," said Robert Raiford, a local radio commentator who bills himself as Charlotte's curmudgeon at large. "It's a city of Babbitts."
Mr. Raiford said that despite its economic successes, Charlotte still took its cultural cues from the North.
"It's made up of a bunch of local yokels who've seen 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' too many times, and they want to make Charlotte a city like that, a sterile sort of Manhattan," he said. "Let's face it, the performing arts here is stock car racing."
But skeptics like Mr. Raiford are hard to find in Charlotte, even in black neighborhoods. Few cities in the South have had as amicable a racial history or have made greater efforts to make a multiracial city work, whether in the schools or in city-backed efforts to build low-income housing.
"Race relations in this community really are good," said Vanessa Greene, executive director of the Afro-American Cultural Center. "Charlotte is a community that's not afraid to confront its problems."
The most appealing thing about Charlotte may be an optimism and a naivete borne of urban success and rural roots.
 
High Cost of Prosperity
 "There is a kind of special sense you have in Charlotte that you're in an unusual moment of history," said Mr. Wood, the Presbyterian pastor. "Things are happening now and you know that it will never be quite this way again. It's got to level off. But there is this sense that there's almost a Camelot quality to the city today."
Still, Charlotte's prosperity has not come without costs, and there are widespread fears that the city is in danger of losing some of the things that have made it successful.
The crime rate is soaring, with murders at a record pace and three times as many felony charges as there were 10 years ago. Homeless people are a haunting presence in the city's downtown. Private school enrollment is growing amid widespread fear that the public school system, despite its success with integration, has become mired in mediocrity. Traffic problems are bad and getting worse.
There are occasional doubts, particularly during a business slump, whether Charlotte can handle those problems better than most other cities. But there is also a refreshing sense, reflective of the camp-revival sensibilities of much of the South, that solutions are not out of reach.
"We haven't built enough housing, we haven't done all we can with job training and the school system," said Mr. Gantt, the former Mayor. "But we still keep moving in that direction. One of the things I like about this place, notwithstanding all the boosterism, is that there's a continual debate about our priorities. At least this is a place that's still willing to keep talking about its problems."

HEADLINE: Dr. Chassin: Promising, Untested

 BODY:
Just when public and private funding began to run dry in the 1980's, the twin epidemics of AIDS and drug abuse put costly new pressures on New York's health care system. That made a firm grasp of economics and regulation essential to the job of state health commissioner.
On that ground, Dr. Mark Chassin, Governor Cuomo's choice to take over the job now, looks well qualified. His capacity to fill the job's political dimension remains to be tested. 
 The resignation of Dr. David Axelrod, who suffered a stroke in February, left a large gap. During his 12 years as Health Commissioner, he demonstrated uncommon integrity and common sense. He resisted efforts to invade the privacy of AIDS patients, and campaigned for, among other things, bans on smoking and set new rules giving hospital interns reasonable working hours and better supervision.
Beyond those issues, he cared passionately about New York's most serious and chronic health problem: the lack of adequate primary care.
Most people rely on a family doctor for routine check-ups, prenatal and pediatric services and treatment of illness in its early stages. But as family doctors abandoned poor neighborhoods, more and more patients were forced to rely on expensive hospital emergency rooms or outpatient clinics for such care; increasing numbers simply go without it, seeking help only when illness becomes too advanced to ignore. By then, of course, it is usually far more complicated and far more costly to treat.
While New York's health commissioner has no authority to build clinics on his own, he wields enormous power: he regulates rates at which the big public and private health insurance plans reimburse hospitals, doctors and clinics. The commissioner can advance policy goals by the way he manipulates those rates -- like increasing the reimbursement amounts a hospital might claim to finance a new satellite primary care clinic, reducing those for superfluous new equipment.
There will be hearings on Dr. Chassin's nomination, but the evidence so far is that he has the intellectual equipment to handle the challenges. His experience as a Federal Medicare administrator in the late 70's and then as a RAND researcher gives him sophisticated knowledge of economic and policy issues. Such knowledge, capable of saving the state millions in health costs, easily justifies Governor Cuomo's decision to sweeten the salary of $98,399 authorized for the commissioner with an additional $61,601 for heading a research institute.
Still, the job requires more than intellect. Health care politics in New York involves powerful hospitals, the doctors' medical society, employee unions, an aggressive lobby for AIDS patients and other constituencies.
Even when fiscal pressures caused politics to heat up, Dr. Axelrod stood up for fairness and the public interest, often in the face of furious opposition. That record leaves a powerful challenge for any successor. Dr. Chassin's substantive background makes him a welcome choice. But how well he meets the challenge depends heavily on principled political strength -- the Governor's and, as he grows in office, his own.

HEADLINE: Source of Jobs in 80's Fizzles in 90's

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
As the economy limps out of a recession, a spurt of layoffs, hiring freezes and corporate mergers is hitting some of the biggest engines of the 80's expansion: service companies, government and high-tech manufacturing.
The job dearth is also a portent that the 90's may produce new jobs at the slowest rate since the 1950's, say economists at Data Resources/McGraw-Hill. 
 In some ways, the hesitation to hire at the beginning of a recovery is not unusual. Companies also chopped thousands of jobs early in the last recovery and postponed hiring for several months after the end of the 1981-82 recession. Indeed, once growth resumed in the 80's, employers hired 20 million new hands. Even now, most indicators of future hiring are flashing green, if weakly.
 
Cost Cutting Called Essential
 But what's different now is that some of the most expansive -- and in some cases competitive -- parts of the economy are doing the pruning. Governments generally cannot raise taxes fast enough to keep up the hiring pace of the 80's. Formerly youthful growth industries like computers have matured. And, like autos, steel and textiles a decade ago, many service industries are now struggling with flat productivity, bloated costs and stiff competition. "Cost cutting has become essential for survival," said Stephen Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley.
"We've got to do this forever, "said Gerald A. Blumberg, senior vice president of human resources at Du Pont, referring to a drive to cut costs by $1 billion, which will shrink the company's head count by thousands.
In the military industry, payroll cuts are likely to stretch for years. "Our world market share is shrinking at the same time defense budgets are shrinking," said Ken Cannestra, president of the Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Group in Marietta, Ga. "It's changed the way we think about hiring. You're going to see a steady decrease for a few more years."
A computer industry consultant, Ulric Weil, said the situation in that industry echoed what was happening in defense: "Digesting excess manufacturing capacity means closing some facilities. It also means shifting from the left to the right foot, recognizing that computers have become a commodity. The rosy, golden early 80's are gone for good."
Over all, the restructuring of certain industries, along with modest growth in the number of working Americans, points to sluggish job growth. Forecasters at Data Resources/McGraw Hill predict that payrolls will grow at an average rate of 1.1 percent a year in the 90's, compared with 1.7 percent in the 80's. While service companies are likely to generate almost all of the additional jobs, they will do so at less than half the rate of the 80's.
"One unusual aspect of this recession is that service-producing industries were hit as hard as they were," said Jack Bregger, assistant commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Total payroll jobs declined just half as much in the latest recession as in the 1981-82 recession, and manufacturing employment shrank by just one-third as much, 4 percent compared with 11 percent. Despite the addition of 287,000 health care jobs, service industries lost hundreds of thousands of jobs, more than in any other recession.
 
Government Jobs Declining
 Now in the early stages of a recovery, job growth in services is lagging behind earlier rebounds. Goverment payrolls, which held steady until spring, are now shrinking.
If the old engines are sputtering, who will churn out the modest stream of jobs that economists expect? Nobody really knows. As Mr. Steinberg at Merrill Lynch put it, "If the economy had depended on Fortune 500 companies to create new jobs, none would have been created." Roseanne Cahn, an economist at First Boston, added, "Shrinking industries are visible; growth industries aren't."
An example from the hard-pressed auto insurance business will drive that point home. High-cost insurance giants like Aetna, Cigna and Travelers are cutting thousands of jobs as they pull back from an unprofitable business. But David A. Simmons, president of the Tulsa General Insurance Agency, is planning to expand his staff by 10 to 15 percent this year, just as he did last year.
His secret? Tulsa General is busy installing machines similar to automated bank teller machines in supermarkets and shopping malls that let customers buy auto liability insurance in minutes without ever talking to an insurance agent, who usually collected 15 to 20 percent commissions on each policy. So far, each machine has been logging 35 quotes and selling 8 to 10 policies a day. "Now, no agent could do that much business, said Mr. Simmons, who added that there was still plenty of work in processing the policies at the home office.
 
Settling for Less
 But the old job generators of the 80's still suffer. College recruiting at Merrill Lynch, said Launton F. Simkins, director of human resource development, is off by more than 50 percent from 1987. "I think we're going to continue to consolidate and downsize," he said. These days, newly minted B.A.'s and M.B.A.'s at Baruch College in New York City, the biggest taxpayer-financed business school in the nation, are more willing to join small companies, take more junior positions and move out of New York, said Richard Brody, director of job placement. He also noted that they were getting few offers to join the civil service.
Even fast-food chains, which absorbed teen-agers the way french fries soak up oil, just aren't hiring as many people. In the two worst recessions of the postwar era, this industry added a few hundred thousand hamburger flippers and counter helpers. But in the most recent recession the head count barely stayed even.
"There's no question that the rate of growth will be substantilly slower in the 90's," said Carl Steidtmann at Management Horizons of Cincinnati, a consulting firm. "The business is saturated. So there's a constant pressure to improve productivity."
 
White Collar Jobs Affected
 Although executive headhunters at Korn-Ferry recently reported "strong signs that the recession in senior executive jobs is easing," the biggest losers are likely to be white-collar workers, especially those who labor in back offices. There is "a lasting threat to job security," said Mitchell Fromstein, president of Manpower Inc., a temporary help concern based in Milwaukee. "White-collar workers haven't had to deal with that."
"Adminstrators aren't in demand," said Burke Stimson, a spokesman for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, referring to plans to eliminate thousands of jobs in the wake of A.T.& T.'s acquisition of the NCR Corporation. "The white-collar contingent and the meeting-goers aren't in demand. People who pass memos back and forth aren't in demand."
A number of bankers, many of whom joined the business in the clubby days before financial deregulation, are learning the hard way. "There's an enormous amount of excess in the system today," said Michael R. Zucchini, executive vice president of the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group and the bank's chief information officer. Mr. Zucchini is helping to fold the failed $13 billion Bank of New England into the $20 billion Fleet. "Most banks want to do this type of consolidation," he said.
A big chunk of the savings that Fleet is striving for -- cutting the costs of the combined operations in half -- is coming from merging back-office computer and accounts-processing operations, which should eventually eliminate more than 1,000 jobs, many of them supervisory.
The drive to consolidate computer operations also hurt computer makers. Such customers cut their spending on information technology last year, said Morgan Stanley's Mr. Roach, who added that service companies as a whole spent less on information technology than they had since 1975.
The fallout is devastating. The Digital Equipment Corporation used to hire thousands of new hands a year, said Russ Johnson, manager of United States staffing and planning. Now the company, which dropped 8,000 jobs last year, is said to be planning similar cuts this year. "We've still got a way to go," Mr. Johnson said. "I hate to say this is always going to be this way, but these are systemic changes."
All this pain for individual workers may produce some gain for the economy. Signs of at least a temporary spurt in productivity came last month when the Government reported that output per hour perked up at a 1.9 percent rate last spring as payrolls shrank and production swelled.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 4, 1991, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Aug. 24 about the job outlook in the service sector misstated actions by the Cigna Corporation. Cigna did not cut thousands of jobs when it began to phase out its auto insurance business; employees were transferred to other parts of the company.

 BODY:
AMERICAN CASSANDRA: The Life of Dorothy Thompson, by Peter Kurth. (Little, Brown, $12.95.) By the late 1930's, when The New York Herald Tribune gave her a column next to Walter Lippmann's, Dorothy Thompson had become so influential a journalist that Time magazine said she was the country's second most popular woman, after Eleanor Roosevelt. Readers "will be pleased to meet a fascinating, driven and indomitable woman who richly deserves this fine biography," Thomas Griffith said here last year.
LIKE LIFE, by Lorrie Moore. (Plume, $8.95.) In one of these stories about people stranded by love, a playwright whose girlfriend has left him becomes obsessed by the idea that he is being poisoned by truck fumes in his apartment above a sex shop in Times Square. In 1990 our reviewer, Stephen McCauley, praised Lorrie Moore for "the accuracy of her observations, the lyricism of many of her descriptions and the wry view of behavior wryly expressed." She has written "a rewarding, even exhilarating book." 
 THE MOTHER TONGUE: English & How It Got That Way, by Bill Bryson. (Avon, $9.95.) An American journalist tells how an obscure Anglo-Saxon tongue acquired a weird mix of Scandinavian and Norman vocabulary and a Latinate grammar and spread like a computer virus throughout the world. "What an engaging tour guide he is," Burt Hochberg said here last year. "We can't help sharing his pleasure in turning up odd, interesting facts or in pointing out grammatical blunders committed by famous grammarians."
A PLACE I'VE NEVER BEEN, by David Leavitt. (Penguin, $8.95.) The love triangles in these short stories consist of a complicated array of gender permutations, Wendy Martin said in The Book Review last year. "Mr. Leavitt has the wonderful ability to lead the reader to examine heterosexist assumptions without becoming polemical."
LONGING FOR DARKNESS. Tara and the Black Madonna: A Ten-Year Journey, by China Galland. (Penguin, $12.95.) Giving up Roman Catholicism for Buddhism, the author makes pilgrimages to Tibet, Eastern Europe, Texas and New Mexico seeking a spiritual link between the Virgin Mary and the goddess Tara. Last year our reviewer, Carol Zaleski, called this book a "heartfelt account of a search for the feminine face of God."
MOTHER EARTH FATHER SKY, by Sue Harrison. (Avon, $5.99.) After the other members of her village are massacred, a teen-age girl and her little brother set out on a journey to find her grandfather's tribe. Sue Harrison "expertly frames dramatic events with depictions of prehistoric life in the Aleutian Islands," Katherine Ramsland said here in 1990.
TEACHERS AT WORK: Achieving Success in Our Schools, by Susan Moore Johnson. (Basic Books, $12.95.) One of the most important ways to improve education, the author discovered in interviews with teachers, is to make the country's rundown classrooms less depressing places to work in. Last year our reviewer, Joan Countryman, called this book "a fine account of the physical, organizational, sociological, economic, political, cultural and psychological features of an adult's day at school."
CURRENT AFFAIRS, by Barbara Raskin. (Ivy, $5.95.) Two sisters -- a glamorous journalist who claims to have slept with Fidel Castro and a social worker who runs a homeless shelter -- come across secret documents linking the Iran-contra affair to the Washington drug trade. Last year our reviewer, Linda Wertheimer, said the novel is "stylish and slangy, written in a wild and wordy prose that is engaging and catchy."
WHEN THE WORLD WAS WHOLE: Three Centuries of Memories, by Charles Fenyvesi. (Penguin, $10.95.) Drawing on the records and recollections of his relatives, Charles Fenyvesi chronicles his Hungarian family's rise under the Hapsburgs, its fall in World War I and its near extinction under the Nazis. He has written "a family and social history that is both enchanting and devastating," Jeff Kisseloff said here last year.
MADENSKY SQUARE, by Eva Ibbotson. (Avon, $4.50.) Told from the point of view of a 36-year-old dressmaker, this romantic novel centers on life in Vienna on the eve of World War I. In 1989 our reviewer, Katrinka Blickle, said Eva Ibbotson "has fine-tuned -- and perhaps even enlarged -- the genre."
BOUND TO LEAD: The Changing Nature of American Power, by Joseph S. Nye Jr. (Basic Books, $10.95.) An expert on international affairs at Harvard argues that when all factors are taken into account -- economic, cultural and technological as well as military -- the United States is still No. 1. In 1990 our reviewer, Michael R. Beschloss, said this book is a welcome corrective to scholars like Paul Kennedy who say America is overextended and in decline.
A CITY OF STRANGERS, by Robert Barnard. (Dell, $4.50.) In a Yorkshire town, the beer-guzzling patriarch of a family that makes the Simpsons seem genteel is killed by a firebomb. Last year our reviewer, Josh Rubins, said, "The result is as good an example as any of the humorous mystery novel at its unpretentious best: playful but far from giddy, perfectly poised between drollery . . . and the stern realities of crime and punishment."

HEADLINE: ART;
Italy, Land of Art Treasures Just Out of Visitors' View

BYLINE: By ALEXANDER STILLE; Alexander Stille, an American journalist living in Rome, writes frequently about Italian subjects.

DATELINE: ROME

 BODY:
Several times this summer, the usual throng of Japanese, German and American tourists has made the pilgrimage from Rome to Tivoli to see the villa of the Roman emperor Hadrian only to be turned away by a sign saying: "Closed for lack of personnel." Although there are 43 guards assigned to the villa, the staff had trouble mustering the minimum of seven needed to open the gates.
 The same scene has been played out across Italy this summer at dozens of major monuments and museums. Even the Roman Forum, the heart of ancient Rome, has been forced to shut its gates on occasion. As the weather heats up and the tourists arrive in force, the guards needed to watch over Italy's art treasures simply vanish. 
 Italy's most widely visited museum, the Uffizi in Florence, has had to keep about a third of its rooms closed during the tourist season. Each day, curators count up the number of guards who have bothered to show up to work, and calculate how many rooms they can open and for how long. Tourists can still see Leonardo and Botticelli, but forget about Bronzino, Perugino, Giorgione or Bellini. The museum crisis is becoming as much an Italian summer ritual as the Palio horse race in Siena or the Spoleto Music Festival.
The phantom museum guards are only the most obvious byproduct of the bloated and sclerotic bureaucracy that governs Italy's national museum system. Museums here have virtually no autonomy, and every decision, from restoring a painting to hiring an extra worker, must pass through the Ministry of Culture in Rome. Moreover, the ministry is subject to the whims and dizzying intrigues of Italy's continual Government crises: there have been five ministers in the last five years, which means that important decisions are often held up for months.
The result: crumbling buildings, filthy paintings, lack of catalogues and research, endless restoration projects and frequent thefts. Things have reached the point that 49 percent of Italy's 1,673 museums are currently closed -- and this number does not include the ones that close on the odd day when no one shows up for work.
 "The problem is not a lack of personnel," says Senator Luigi Covatta, undersecretary of the Ministry of Culture and the man responsible for running the museum system. "There are plenty of guards. The problem is that they are state employees who enjoy a whole series of privileges."
Like all state employees, museum guards are entitled by law to two weeks of thermal baths above and beyond their usual seven weeks of paid vacation. Others disappear for weeks or months at a time, thanks to medical certificates. And when Senator Covatta threatened to fire custodians at the Brera in Milan for refusing to observe union work rules, he was taken to court for anti-union activity. The case is pending.
 The situation at the Brera encapsulates the problem. In the Alice in Wonderland world of Italian bureaucracy, the museum's dearth of custodians actually worsened after their number was nearly tripled in 1986. "At the Brera in 1986, 40 custodians managed to keep open 38 rooms; now in 1991, with 108 guards, they can only keep open 27 rooms," says Senator Covatta.
 Last year, museum guards at the Brera were absent for a total of 8,673 days, three months apiece. Because they are state run, northern Italian museums like the Brera hire guards through a Government system that gives preference to unemployed workers from southern Italy, most of whom consider assignment to cities like Milan extreme hardship. Guards generally make only about $1,000 a month, and those from the south frequently cannot afford to take their families with them. As a result, they return home at the first opportunity.
 For many years the Brera had been open only in the morning and was able to show only about two-thirds of its collection. The increase in guards in 1986, instead of solving the problem, began the battle of Brera. The new guards complained about the lack of ventilation in the museum, called in a local health authority and obtained an extraordinary concession: for every hour of work, they would get a half-hour break. This was called decanting, following the practice of allowing wine to breathe. With the decanting policy in place, along with thermal baths and sick days, the museum abandoned its plan to stay open in the afternoon.
 This spring, Senator Covatta and the Brera's director decided to try again. In May, the custodians' union agreed to abandon the decanting policy. But the guards at the Brera rebelled and threatened to take over the museum. According to their spokesman, Stefano Esposito, in an interview with Panorama magazine, the Government and the national union had "signed an agreement over our heads, without even consulting us." The next day, the Ministry of Culture ordered the museum closed and threatened to man it with volunteers and conscientious objectors. The wildcat strike lasted for only a day.
 For the moment, a truce has been reached. The guards have agreed to work in the afternoon starting in the fall, and the museum is trying to meet their demand for an employee cafeteria.
 But the custodian problem is only a symptom. "The underlying problem is an antiquated, state-run system," says Senator Covatta. "The individual museums have no autonomy. Furthermore, our museums are in beautiful but very old palaces, whose restoration is complex and expensive."
 For virtually every expense, the director of a museum must turn to the regional superintendent of culture, who, in turn, must turn to Rome. "Sometimes by the time the money arrives it's too late to spend it, and it has to go back to Rome," says Federico Zeri, an art historian and a onetime trustee of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif. Money appropriated in a given year must be spent by the end of that year, so that if funds don't reach a museum by late in the year, they have to be returned to the Government. As a result, many building and restoration projects start and stop with the unpredictable ebb and flow of funds.
Work at the Gallery of the Villa Borghese in Rome has dragged on for more than 10 years, making its masterly collection of Bernini, Caravaggio and Titian difficult, and often impossible, to see. The National Roman Museum, with Rome's principal collection of ancient art, has been mostly closed for the same period. Work proceeds on both with no clear end in sight.
 The Ministry of Culture is only one of the national bureaucracies with which museums must contend. It distributes funds, but the Ministry of Finance is in charge of collecting the money museums make in admissions and sales. "A museum like the Uffizi does not even have a balance sheet," says Senator Covatta. "It has no control over what it earns." For this reason, museum directors have no economic incentive to attract the public, put on special exhibitions, publish catalogues or stay open longer hours.
 Also, because the Ministry of Culture is low in the political pecking order, museums often have less space than they need -- or even than they are allotted. The national museum at the Barberini Palace, with perhaps Rome's most important painting collection, has about half the space it is entitled to because it shares a floor with an army social club. "This club, which does nothing but give parties, was supposed to be evicted in 1951, and here we are 40 years later," says Mr. Zeri, the art historian. The reason, say some, is simple: the Minister of Defense has more power than the Minister of Culture.
 Senator Covatta, although a political appointee, favors decentralization and privatization of the system. His idea is that the largest museums would become almost completely autonomous, each run by its own separate foundation. The works of art would remain in the public domain, but such services as guarding the museum and running the bookstore would be contracted out to private companies.
 "Italy doesn't seem to realize that art and antiquities are the country's greatest resource -- what oil is to Saudi Arabia," says Adriano D'Offizi, director of Hadrian's villa. "Four hundred thousand people come through here every year, and we could double the number easily and do it properly if we had the means."
 So far, reactions to Senator Covatta's decentralization plan have been positive, but it has not yet entered the political arena. As he well knows, the Government could fall at any minute, and in the division of spoils among the governing parties, his job could be bargained away.

Bold Images That Show Why the 20's Roared

BYLINE: By Michael Kimmelman

DATELINE: MONTREAL

 BODY:
The Chrysler Building rose above the streets of New York and the Bugatti Royale cruised the streets of Europe. Lindbergh flew solo in his single-engine "Spirit of St. Louis" across an ocean plied by a new generation of gigantic luxury liners. Spectacular utopian dreams were conceived to rejuvenate a continent ravaged by a war of unprecedented brutality. From London and Vienna to New York and Chicago, the working masses who had transformed the cities of the 19th century into the metropolises of the 20th called for widespread social reforms. At the same time, a wave of conservatism resounded in the French "rappel a l'ordre," or call to order, and in the Neo-Classicism of artists like Picasso and de Chirico.
 Only an exhibition as enormous and ambitious and exhilarating as "The 1920's: Age of the Metropolis," here at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, through Nov. 10, could begin to do its sprawling subject justice. 
 No show can encapsulate a decade, and this one retraces the familiar steps, from Expressionism through Dadaism, Constructivism and the Bauhaus, Art Deco and cafe society. And yet by bringing under one roof so much diverse and remarkable material, it goes a long way toward outlining the overarching characteristics of the period. A kind of grandiose folly, "The 1920's" seems uncannily matched to a decade that spawned Hugh Ferriss's vision of the city of the future and Le Corbusier's scheme to destroy Paris and rebuild it as a series of skyscrapers and plazas.
Accompanied by an appropriately gigantic 638-page catalogue, the exhibition brings together some 700 works by almost 300 artists. Paintings, photographs, furniture, sculptures, decorative arts, drawings and architectural models have been culled from scores of public and private collections around the world. Rooms have been set aside in which to view films and hear music from the period. The museum's permanent holdings have been taken down so that every inch of display space can be given over to what is the largest exhibition that this institution has ever mounted. (It will not travel.)
 Among the most memorable works in the show are the elaborate architectural and sculptural reconstructions, including the grottolike room from Kurt Schwitters's home; the model for Vladimir Tatlin's "Monument to the Third International"; Laszlo Moholy-Nagy's "Light-Space Modulator," and Theo van Doesburg's flower room from the Villa de Noailles. To one side of the entrance to the exhibition there is even a De Havilland 60X Moth airplane, which has somehow miraculously been squeezed through the museum's doors. After all this, the gleaming 1927 Bugatti convertible in one of the later galleries seems almost mundane.
 An international team of curators, under the leadership of Jean Clair, director of the Musee Picasso in Paris, has focused the exhibition on three cities of primary significance -- Berlin, Paris and New York, with the section on Berlin the densest and most impressive. The organizers have been careful to point out instances in which other places, including Russia and the Netherlands, played important roles in the cultural legacy of the decade. "The 1920's" is as much an exhibition about the social history of the period as it is about art history, and it begins with posters, and with gripping prints by Otto Dix, that evoke the devastation of World War I. The show includes sections on images of the working classes, utopia, cabaret society and mechanization.
 The result is a richly textured image of the era. It is one thing to consider drawings for set designs and photographs from the futuristic Fritz Lang film, "Metropolis," as reminders of the extraordinary technological advances made by the movie industry during the decade. But it is another thing to see them, as they are here, in the context of Rudolf Belling's "Sculpture 23" and paintings by the Cologne Progressives, like Franz Wilhelm Seiwert and Heinrich Hoerle. Lang clearly followed the path of these other artists, who had depicted the workers in the new industries as machines. The 1920's was the decade that coined the word robot, and Machine Mary from the 1926 film is a steel cousin to Belling's bronze sculpture of three years earlier.
 It is still another thing to consider "Metropolis" against the backdrop of the grandiose urban development schemes of German architects like Hans Poelzig, Bruno Taut, Walter Gropius and Ludwig Hilberseimer, schemes that sought to renew, both physically and spiritually, a country devastated by the war. Lang's vision of the city, in many ways prescient, looks downright tame beside Wenzel Hablik's wild proposals for towers and domes made of glass, a material considered to be symbolic of purity.
 Tamara de Lempicka's Art Deco portraits fit neatly in a section on cabaret society, but in the broad context of the exhibition they also raise the issue of the "new" woman who in the 1920's finally won a share of independence. She is epitomized by de Lempicka's suave painting of the Duchesse de La Salle in pants and riding boots.
 From de Lempicka it is not a big leap to the work of the American artist Guy Pene du Bois, whose sharply contoured, highly simplified image of "Mr. and Mrs. Chester Dale Dining Out" in turn recalls Leger's "Mechanic." From Leger it is another short hop to the abstract paintings of Le Corbusier, with their emphases on orderliness and control, ideas central to the 1920's and even implicit by their absence in the work of the Dadaists and Surrealists.
 And so on. The show seems always circling back on itself, reprising and expanding on themes that bridge the boundaries between one culture and another, that amend the cliches about pessimistic Berlin, optimistic New York and nonchalant Paris. Reginald Marsh's paintings of New York look familiar after a work like "Silk Stocking Counter" by the French painter Yves Alix. Charles Demuth's sober meditations on industrialism seem almost like variations on the works of the German painter Karl Volker.
 "The 1920's" presents works by dozens of lesser-known or long-forgotten artists, including Volker and Alix, which round out the picture of the period. The show is also full of first-rate objects. Among the especially fine group of decorative works are a sumptuous cabinet of ebony, mother of pearl and silver from 1927 by Louis Sue and Andre Mare, and a wrought-iron and brass five-panel screen by Edgar William Brandt and Henri Favier, which is a masterpiece of intricate design. The level of handicraft reached spectacular heights in France during a decade known for the idealistic attempts by German, Dutch and Russian designers of the Bauhaus, De Stijl and Constructivist movements to exploit the new industrial technologies.
The 1920's really began with the end of World War I and ended with the beginning of the Depression. Between hope and despair was a decade of social, cultural, sexual and economic upheaval carried out at a pace to match the new cars and planes, and in a world made to seem smaller by these innovations. "It was a little alarming -- this shrinkage," wrote Virginia Woolf in 1928. One of the lessons of this splendid exhibition is how familiar that era seems.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Tax Collectors Lean On the Out-of-Towners

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
TRAVELERS who sense that their vacation dollars are sliding out of their wallets faster than planned are not suffering a delusion. An economical $50 hotel room in the United States actually costs an average of $54.20 with tax, and that does not count a sales tax on the video you rented or an 8.5 percent tax on the four breakfasts you put on the room bill. Across the country, every travel expense costs 2 percent to 19 percent more than is listed on the rate card, menu or ticket.
The residents of a city pay its sales taxes, of course, but visitors' sensations that everyone is taking a bite as they swim by is not incorrect: surcharges, surtaxes and extra fees fall heavily upon nonresidents, who are not likely to see huge signs: "Welcome to Columbus, where you'll pay 15.75 percent tax on your hotel room." 
 "It's a trend," said Aubrey C. King, who is working on a travel industry committee researching the subject. "People think it's safe to tax travelers where they don't vote."
Mr. King's committee, the Travel and Tourism Government Affairs Council, which is sponsored by 33 tourism groups, conspicuously the Travel Industry Association in Washington, D.C., has gathered data on these add-ons and has estimated how much taxes have risen in the last seven years.
Measured in 1989 dollars, he estimated, travel taxes and fees rose from $32.4 billion in 1984 to $36.4 billion in 1989, a rise of $4 billion. His research indicated that of the 1989 total, $20.4 billion went to the Federal Government; $10.4 billion went to state governments and $5.5 billion to localities. It is not clear how much of this has to do with a rise in the tax rate and how much with a rise in prices and expansion in the travel industry. Travel by foreigners to the United States increased by 6 percent a year from 1984 to 1988, and domestic travel also rose, though somewhat less.
The committee research surveyed the 50 states and came up with these figures: State and local taxes on hotel rooms now average 8.4 percent; on restaurant meals, 8.5 percent; on admissions, 2.9 percent; on rental cars or campsite rentals, 2.7 percent.
Mr. King said that the committee believed that the Federal Government did not have a clear picture of the way travel taxes are accumulating. "We estimate that 15 to 20 percent of the new revenues that developed in the 1990 budget reconciliation process falls upon travelers," he said. Among the increases he listed for last year was the rise in the air ticket tax to 10 percent from 8 percent and a rise to 14 cents from 9 cents in the Federal gasoline tax.
 
Still Other Charges
 There is more. On May 13, a $2 Agriculture Department fee was imposed on all airline passengers arriving on the United States mainland from overseas. Like the 10 percent Federal tax, it is added to the price of the ticket. This fee, which also grew out of the 1990 budget agreement, is intended to pay for the department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the agency charged with protecting against plant and tree pests and animal disease from overseas.
On Aug. 1, the Agriculture fee was to have been extended to passengers from Hawaii and Puerto Rico, but this step has been postponed until Oct. 1; bills have been introduced to keep the fee from being imposed on domestic travel. The Air Transport Association, whose members are airlines, wants the whole fee repealed or at least reduced to $1.
Caree VanderLinden of the inspection service said that the new tax was also applied to trucks and trains coming from Mexico. The yield from passengers arriving from overseas, she said, was expected to be $50 million annually.
Another tax, called the "passenger facility charge," essentially a user fee for airports, is on the way next year. It could add as much as $12 to the price of a ticket: $1, $2 or $3 for each departure from or connection at a United States airport, with a maximum of four fees per ticket.
In June, the Federal Aviation Administration adopted rules permitting the collection of this tax;the agency or city that operates an airport gets the yield and may use it for certain approved airport improvements.
The tax is added to the price of the ticket, except for tickets sold overseas; in such cases, the fee will be collected in cash at the airport, a process familiar to overseas travelers. The airlines, for their trouble, are allowed to keep 12 cents for each fee collected in the first three years; 8 cents after that. Initially, the airlines are also allowed to keep the interest on all the money they have collected and must hold until an airport gets its improvement plan approved and is authorized to spend the money.
 
Adverse Impact
 The accompanying chart shows increases in total taxes on hotel rooms since 1984 for all 16 cities that the National Conference of State Legislatures says have double-digit rates. Here are breakdowns on how some of these taxes are distributed.
Orlando, Fla.: 10 percent or 8 percent, depending on the county: 6 percent state sales tax, plus a 4 percent "resort" tax on hotel-condo rooms in Osceola County and Orange County, where Disney World is situated; in Seminole County, this is 2 percent.
New York: 19.25 percent plus $ 2: 8.25 percent state and city sales tax, plus 6 percent city occupancy tax, plus 5 percent state occupancy tax if room costs more than $100, plus $2 city tax for rooms over $40.
New Orleans: 11 percent plus $1, $2 or $ 3: 4 percent for the Superdome, 2 percent for the Convention Center, 2 percent to the state general fund, 1.5 percent to Orleans Parish school board and 1.5 percent to the city fund, plus city occupancy tax of $1 a night on hotels up to 299 rooms; $2 a night, 300 to 999 rooms, and $3 a night, 1,000 rooms and above.
San Francisco: 11 percent city sales tax for rooms occupied less than 30 days; there is no state sales tax on rooms.
Columbus, Ohio: 5.75 percent city sales tax plus 10 percent state bed tax.
Chicago: 12.4 percent: 6 percent state occupancy tax, 3 percent city hotel tax, 2 percent sports facility tax, 1.1 special events fund and 0.3 collection fund.
Meanwhile, people in the travel industry worry that the taxes will kill the source of the golden tourism egg. Said Mr. King of the trade group: "We are very concerned about its impact on travel, including travelers from abroad."

HEADLINE: After a Long Slump, Home Sales Rise

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
SALES of houses, co-ops and condominiums in the New York metropolitan area, still near the bottom of a slump that has been longer and deeper than any since before World War II, have improved steadily since the spring in what analysts say is the beginning of a slow recovery.
Throughout the region, real estate executives say sales volume surged in March, reflecting a decline in interest rates and a sense of economic euphoria that accompanied the resolution of the war in the Persian Gulf. Sales for April, May and June were sharply higher than the year earlier. 
 Since then, sales have tapered off in a pattern that is typical of sluggish summer activity, but remain stronger than a year ago. Prices, after dropping more than 30 percent since 1988, show no signs of rising, and indeed continue to sink slightly in many communities.
A result is that buyers, though still cautious and choosy, are committing themselves in growing numbers. First-time buyers, who have watched housing values sink for three years, now represent the strongest segment of the market in many communities and neighborhoods.
"The kind of places I like have come down to what I can afford," said Lisa Rosenberg, a Manhattan lawyer who bought her first home. She looked at 50 apartments before buying a large one-bedroom apartment on King Street, just south of Greenwich Village, in July.
For sellers, the long slump has given rise to a new calculus in housing finance. They may accept less than their house was worth in the recent past, but they pay less for whatever they are buying in replacement.
"Think of it as bartering," said Hal Rose, a Brooklyn medical-laboratory executive who accepted $25,000 less for a two-bedroom Brooklyn Heights co-op than he paid for it in 1986. But he said he also paid $35,000 less than was being asked for a three-story Park Slope town house.
While analysts differ over the the direction of prices -- many expect them to begin rising gradually this year -- there is broad consensus that the increased pace of sales will continue into the fall and winter.
"We have seen continuous, month-by-month improvement in sales, and conditions are in place for further recovery," said Eugene Sherman, senior economist for the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.
One factor that should bolster sales is a reduction in interest rates, which have dropped nearly one percentage point since January, to an average of just under 9.4 percent for fixed, 30-year mortgages. By the end of the year, Mr. Sherman predicted, the rate could fall to 8.75 percent.
Analysts say the increase in home sales during the first half of the year was in part due to pent-up demand created during the second half of 1990. Sales in that period slowed to a virtual standstill amid a rash of layoffs, dire predictions of fiscal problems for the city and suburbs alike, and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Still, the recent flurry of buying appears to reflect more than a temporary game of catch-up. In Manhattan, brokers report a sharp increase in sales of expensive condominiums to foreign buyers, led by Italians, French, Germans and Brazilians. Analysts say the foreigners have seized on the low value of the dollar compared to their currencies to make real estate investments.
More importantly, the analysts say, the steep slide in home values has made New York City and its suburbs, still one of the nation's most expensive housing markets, much more affordable than it was in the late 1980's. That means more first-time buyers are entering the market, and more people who want to buy something better are making their moves.
"I am losing on the sale, but making up for it on the other end," said Mr. Rose, whose wife, Lisa, gave birth to their second child on July 5. They moved into their Park Slope town house only two weeks before the birth, and he said he was happy with the move on both family and financial grounds.
"Too many people in this market are simply focusing on how much they would lose by selling, and not how much they save by buying," he said.
MS. ROSENTHAL paid $170,000 for her co-op on King Street, which fills a full floor of a rowhouse. In her protracted search, which began in 1988, she said she saw several smaller, less attractive one-bedroom co-ops for which the owners were asking over $200,000.
And in Bergenfield, N.J., Laurie Greenberg, an advertising sales executive and another first time buyer plans to close in September on a three-bedroom, expanded Cape Cod with a large deck. She looked at 30 houses, she said, and one reason she is buying now is that she found a fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage at only 9 percent interest.
Across the region, surveys by real estate companies and housing analysts reflect sharply increased activity in recent months.
* In Westchester County, sales of detached one-family homes were stronger in April, May and June than in any comparable period since 1981, according to the county's Board of Realtors, which said buyers closed on 960 houses. Nonetheless, it said the median price of the houses, $287,500, continued a long decline, from $290,000 a year earlier and $298,000 two years earlier.
It also said condominium and co-op sales remained weak, and prices declined. "I think its a bit to early to be sure we've turned the corner," said Merritt Mitchell, president of the Westchester Multiple Listing Service. "I'm hopeful we have."
* In Fairfield County, Conn., a bloated inventory of unsold homes was shrinking during the second quarter in many communities. A study by the William Pitt Real Estate Company, based in Stamford, found 753 houses listed in Greenwich, down from 864 the year before; 2,384 houses available in Bridgeport, down from 2,821 the year before, and 726 houses listed in Stamford, down from 880 the year before.
It said sales volume in most of the county had increased. Still, it found median prices sinking in more than half the communities it surveyed, with particularly large declines of 18.7 percent in Darien and 11.6 percent in Norwalk.
* In Northern New Jersey, including Bergen, Morris, Hudson and Passaic Counties, the pace of home sales increased 30 percent in the second quarter, to 122 a week from 91 a week the year earlier, according to a study by Higgins Realtors, based in Hillsdale. It counted the number of deposits made and sales contracts signed each week.
Nonetheless, it found that the average sale price, $234,000, was down 3 percent from the year before. William F. Higgins, president of the firm, said he expected prices to erode further, partly because of the high number of foreclosed properties being brought on the market by lenders and employment cuts in the banking and insurance industries.
Data on the New York City market are more sketchy, largely because a major part of the market is in co-op sales, which are not reported to city and state authorities and made a part of the public record in the way house sales are. Nonetheless, several city real estate firms said sales had increased sharply starting in March.
In a survey of sales at 46 of Manhattan's most expensive condominium buildings, the Ambrose-Mar Elia Company said the number of apartments sold jumped 47 percent, to 147, during the first half of the year compared with the year-earlier period.
Jean Luban, vice president of the firm, said that more than half the sales were to foreign buyers but that, in contrast to the late 80's, these did not include investors from Japan. Instead, she said the foreign buyers included companies and individuals from Europe and South America who regard dollar-based investments in general, and Manhattan real estate in particular, as safe havens.
The William B. May Company, with offices on the Upper East Side, Greenwich Village, Brooklyn Heights, Park Slope and the Westchester community of Irvington, said it sold 30 percent more apartments in the first half of this year than it did a year ago. Because the average price of the apartments declined, the dollar volume increased by only 10 percent.
Stribling Real Estate, a Manhattan broker that specializes in expensive co-ops on the Upper East and West Sides, said its sales since March have been 300 percent higher than during the same period last year. "We are dazed and happy," said Betsy Dean, the firm's president.
And Richard Cantor Inc., based in SoHo, said sales in May, June and July were 25 percent above a year ago.
"Barring any serious new problems in the city's economy, we have have passed the low of this market," said Richard Cantor, the firm's president. "The oversupply has been removed from the inventory and we are looking for listings."

 BODY:
The New York State Urban Development Corporation is more often identified with giant undertakings than neighborhood-sized projects. But under its 10-month-old Urban and Community Development Program, $5 million is to be awarded to "highly distressed areas" for storefront improvements, feasibility studies and project planning.
Among the latest recipients are the Canarsie Neighborhood Development Association in Brooklyn, which has been awarded up to $50,000 to study improvements to the Rockaway Parkway, Glenwood Road and Flatlands Avenue commercial strips. 
 Another grant, up to $90,000, is to go to the Abyssinian Development Corporation, an offshoot of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, at 132 Odell Clark Place (West 138th Street). It is to be used to study a redevelopment of the adjacent Renaissance Ballroom and New Lafayette Theater, on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, as a commercial complex and catering facility.
"One of the more important things about the program is that it's statewide," said Jan Levy, a spokeswoman for the Urban Development Corporation. "It can help them as much in Horseheads or Elmira as in Harlem or Canarsie."

Outdoor Market Getting Indoor Home

 BODY:
A 15-year-old Queens institution, the Outdoor Farmers Market, held three days a week in downtown Jamaica, is about to get a permanent indoor home. A 26,000-square-foot building scheduled for completion in November will house its produce, plants and flower sellers, as well as a 300-seat, two-story food court with 14 outlets.
The project is on 160th Street just north of Jamaica Avenue. It is being financed with $4.3 million in public and private funds raised by the New York City Economic Development Corporation and a private group in Jamaica, the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, which will operate the market. 
 The steel-and-glass building, designed by James McCullar, a Manhattan architect, is meant to be used all year, and will have large roll gates that will be left open during good weather.
Described by Mr. McCullar as the oldest of its kind in New York City, the market attracts farmers from throughout New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and as many as 5,000 shoppers on market days -- Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. During most of its history, it was held in an open lot on Jamaica Avenue a block south of the construction site. That site was claimed for a new office building.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Exchanges Headquarters;
A Two-in-One Structure With a 'Trading Box' Slab

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
TO the delight of New York officials in desperate need of any development news -- and the dismay of downtown neighbors who see another oversized tower in the works -- the New York Exchanges Headquarters project is taking form.
Designed for the New York Mercantile Exchange, Commodity Exchange, Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, New York Cotton Exchange and New York Futures Exchange, the 1.2 million-square-foot structure is to rise on the block bounded by West, Warren, Greenwich and Murray Streets. It is to be developed by Tishman Speyer Properties of Manhattan and completed in 1994. 
 As planned, the Exchanges Headquarters would be two structures in one. The base would be a 120-foot-high slab called the "trading box," which would encompass two trading floors with a total of 55,000 square feet of space and room for expansion to 100,000 square feet -- four times the size of the trading area now in use at Four World Trade Center. On the east end would be a 47-story office tower, with floors of about 21,000 square feet. At 730 feet in height, it would be equivalent to a skyscraper with 55 floors. There would also be a 400-space garage.
Some 660,000 square feet would be set aside for member firms and companies that do business with them. And 340,000 square feet of service and office space would be used by the exchanges themselves.
The architects are Kevin Roche, John Dinkeloo & Associates, of Hamden, Conn. J. P. Morgan & Company of Manhattan is the financial adviser. Leasing is to be managed by the New York office of LaSalle Partners, which is based in Chicago. The managing director of the project is Amy L. Benenson.
Through its Economic Development Corporation, New York City is to contribute $55 million toward the total construction bill, about $450 million. The New York State Urban Development Corporation is contributing $45 million. Tax and rent benefits worth at least $42.5 million were also awarded to keep the exchanges from moving to the Harborside Financial Center in Jersey City.
The project would be built on a city-owned parking lot in the Washington Street Urban Renewal Area. In the late 1980's, it was designated as the headquarters site for Drexel Burnham Lambert, a deal that fell apart shortly before Drexel did.
Earlier this month, the board of directors of the Urban Development Corporation approved a general project plan for the Exchanges Headquarters. Also, the project began its seven-month trip through the city's land-use review procedure.
Opposition has already been voiced. "I think there is a lot of skepticism as to why they need a building of this size, with vacancy rates in lower Manhattan running at approximately 20 percent," said Paul Goldstein, district manager of Community Board 1. "It's unfortunate that the city had a gun held to its head by the exchanges and felt compelled to give away the store to retain them."
He said the matter was even more sensitive because the tower would rise just west of a residential neighborhood, directly across the street from Public School 234 and only two blocks from Washington Market Park.
ACCORDING to the draft environmental impact statement prepared for the Urban Development Corporation, the "project would cause a significant noise impact" at a noise-monitoring station next to the school and would have "significant traffic impact" at 15 intersections in the area and at the Holland Tunnel entrance. The statement includes proposed mitigations.
More traffic "may increase local carbon monoxide levels," the impact statement said, but the predicted maximum eight-hour concentration levels would still fall within national air-quality standards at the eight monitoring sites in the study area.
The economic price would be high if the exchanges left the city, according to the statement, prepared by Allee King Rosen & Fleming and Philip Habib & Associates.
"Relocation of the industry could lead to a decrease of more than $1 billion in direct economic activity, more than 8,611 commodities industry jobs and more than $75 million in city and state taxes," the document said. "While the industry does not have a large employment base, it makes a substantial contribution to the city and state economies and is important to the city as a focus of national and international finance. Moreover, the industry's focus on national and international commerce make it independent of regional and municipal economic conditions. It is therefore critical to the city and state to assist the industry in staying and growing."
Besides a 20-year occupancy commitment by the exchanges, the statement noted such benefits as 1,620 construction jobs, $28 million in construction-related tax revenues, the potential for growth in employment in the commodities industries and, in time, "substantial increases in ground rent and payments in lieu of real estate taxes."
As for those increased rent and tax payments, however, the city will be waiting quite a while. Rent on the "trading box" will be abated for the first 20 years of the 99-year lease. After that, full rent would be due. For that portion occupied by exchange offices and member firms, there will be an exemption of 80 percent for the first two years after occupancy, 50 percent for the next two years and 20 percent for the next two years. After that, full rent would be due.
The exchanges would not be liable for real estate taxes as such, but rather payments in lieu of taxes. On the portion occupied by the "trading box," however, such payments will be excused for the first 20 years of operation. After that, full payment would be due. For their administrative offices, the exchanges will make no payments in the first two years of occupancy. In the third year, they would pay the equivalent of 25 percent of real-estate taxes. This would rise by increments of 7.5 percent for the next 10 years until it reached the full amount.
Member firms -- those with seats on an exchange -- who commit to space before the closing would be entitled to an exemption of all but 25 percent of their payments in lieu of taxes in the first three years of occupancy. After that, the amount due would rise by increments of 7.5 percent annually until it reached 100 percent in the 13th year.
The project would be exempt from sales taxes and mortgage-recording taxes connected with construction. And the exchanges would be exempt from sales tax for 20 years on any capital improvements.
This is not the first time that the exchanges have been close to developing an ambitious new project in lower Manhattan. In 1985, Mr. Roche was the designer of a 1.2 million-square-foot structure, with a 100,000-square-foot trading floor, that was to have been built on a platform over the ramp to the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel. The plan was abandoned in 1987 because of its complexity and cost.
More than a dozen other sites were considered, but each failed to meet one or more of the exchanges' key criteria: room enough for a vast and virtually column-free trading floor, with adjacent space for exchange offices and member firms; closeness to the rest of the financial-service industry in lower Manhattan; lowest possible building and operating costs and early availability.
Timing was critical in preventing the exchanges from taking advantage of a site in Battery Park City bounded by Murray, West and Vesey Streets and North End Avenue (cater-corner from the parcel now under consideration). Under its contract with the Reichmann family, developers of the World Financial Center, the Battery Park City Authority is prevented from seeking commercial zoning on that site until 1994.
In the last analysis, Harborside "offered an almost ideal physical configuration, lower development and operating costs, and the opportunity to begin construction at a relatively early date," the impact statement said. But the lower Manhattan parcel "presented the best opportunity in New York City to maximize satisfaction of all criteria," the document said, and the state and city incentives "substantially reduced the economic advantages of the New Jersey site."

HEADLINE: Challenging Residency as Job Requirement

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
THE recent settlement of a suit filed by the N.A.A.C.P. against the City of Clifton has renewed the debate over whether municipal employees should be required to live in the towns and cities where they work.
On one level, the debate centers around contentions by the N.A.A.C.P. that the requirements are racially disciminatory. On another, the issue revolves around a question of fairness to municipal workers. Some of the unions that represent uniformed employees argue that the laws should be scrapped, while those that represent clerical workers and laborers assert that the rules should be expanded to include employees like teachers, police officers and firefighters and should be enforced more vigorously. 
 Agreeing with the blue-collar workers are municipal officials who say the requirements are justified because employees who live where they work have a greater stake in the community.
The debate has taken on a particular urgency because many municipalities, battling rising property taxes, increased costs and stagnant development, are struggling to stave the exodus of their highest-paid residents.
The civil rights advocates contend that residency requirements can lead to racial discrimination, particularly in towns that have few minority residents but are near cities with large minority populations. .
"We found that blacks and Hispanics from urban areas were categorically being denied employment in suburban towns because of residency requirements," said Keith M. Jones, president of the New Jersey chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
He said, for example, that a person who lived in Newark would essentially be barred from municipal employment in nearby Harrison because Harrison residents were given preference for jobs there.
As a result, Mr. Jones said, the N.A.A.C.P. filed lawsuits against seven North Jersey municipalities that had predominantly white populations yet were adjacent to urban areas with large minority populations. The suits sought to force the municipalities to rescind their residency requirements. The municipalities that were sued were Bayonne, Millburn, Kearny, West Orange, Fort Lee, Harrison and Clifton.
"From our standpoint, it was a classic civil rights issue," Mr. Jones said.
Only the Harrison case has gone to trial. In that case, a State Superior Court judge ruled that the residency requirement was discriminatory and invalid, but allowed officials to impose a 15-mile radius requirement in its place.
In the Clifton case, the city and the N.A.A.C.P., reacting in part to the Harrison decision, entered an agreement rescinding the residency requirement and imposing a 15-mile radius requirement in its place.
According to Sam Monchak, a lawyer who represented Clifton in the lawsuit, the total population of the city is about 71,000, while about 1,000 of Clifton's residents are black. There are no blacks in the Police or Fire Departments, Mr. Monchak said, and only eight blacks working in other city departments.
Under the terms of the agreement establishing the 15-mile radius, minority members and others who live in Passaic and Essex Counties will now be eligible for Clifton jobs.
Mr. Monchak said that notwithstanding the settlement, Clifton's prior policy of giving job preference to residents was not unusual. "Practically every large municipality in New Jersey has adopted a resident preference law," he said.
Roger L. Kemp, Clifton's City Manager, said resident preference and residency requirement laws were beneficial to communities. He said workers were usually more committed to their jobs if they lived in town and were more likely to contribute to the economic life of a community if they spent their paychecks there and paid municipal taxes.
In addition, he said, public safety employees who live in the municipality they serve are more likely to be available in emergencies. "We would virtually have them in a law-enforcement capacity for 24 hours a day," Mr. Kemp said.
Under current state law, municipalities are free to establish residency restrictions for most public employees. Some, for example, require employees to live in the city at the time of appointment and then continue to live there for as long as they are employed.
Others allow nonresidents to be hired, but require that they become residents within a certain time. Still others limit job opportunities to residents, but then allow employees to move out after a specific time.
Teachers, however, are exempt from all residency requirements by state law. And though police officers and firefighters can be required to live within a city at their appointment, municipalities are prohibited from making residence mandatory for such employees after they are hired.
As a result, many teachers and public safety employees -- often some of the highest-paid employees of a municipality -- live outside the communities they serve.
In Trenton, for instance, a substantial majority of firefighters live outside the city.
"We're finding that more and more of our people don't live in the city," said Deputy Fire Chief Dennis Keenan. Nearly 80 percent of the rank-and-file firefighters live outside the city, he said, and only three of Trenton's 13 top-ranking officers live within it.
And that, Mr. Keenan said, can cause problems. "When we get a second or third alarm, we activate reserve companies to cover the rest of the city," he said. "But when a fellow lives 45 miles away, by the time he gets out of his house and gets here, it's too late."
 
Relying on Volunteers
 Mr. Keenan said that as a result, "we have to rely more and more on the volunteer departments on the outskirts of the city to come in and help."
He said that Trenton had a residency law for police officers and firefighters but that law "really doesn't mean anything."
Since police officers and firefighters cannot be required to live within city limits after they are hired, many simply establish residences in Trenton in order to obtain jobsand move out after they are sworn in.
"We've had cases where two or three people have rented a small apartment, and they establish that as their residence," he said. "You go there, and everything points to the fact that that's where they live -- they even change their driver's license and voting registration -- but you know in your heart that they're not going to be there two months after they're appointed."
In Camden, as many as 90 percent of the city's 275 firefighters live outside the city, said Capt. Joseph Marini. The city, like most of the state's large municipalities, has a residency ordinance.
 
'It's a Farce'
 "It's a farce," Captain Marini said. "The day after they appoint you, you can move out."
Captain Marini, who has been in the Camden Fire Department for 15 years, moved out of the city nine years ago.
"I had to move out," he said. "My house was burglarized four times, my mother was mugged, my sister was mugged and my car was stolen twice. There was no quality of life here. It was like living in Beirut."
Given that residency requirements, in practice, do not prevent police officers, firefighters and teachers from living where they want, there has been little inducement in recent years for those municipal employees to tinker with the status quo.
But in light of the recent efforts by the N.A.A.C.P. to eliminate residency requirements in some towns, and the resulting court ruling and out-of-court settlement setting radius restrictions for employees, some union officials say it is now time to push for an "across the board" statewide policy abolishing all residency requirements for uniformed employees.
"I think that we should push for legislation that would make all towns open for competitive examinations," said John Gerow, president of the Newark firefighters' union. Mr. Gerow said he would call for the drafting of such legislation and would search for a sponsor at the International Association of Fire Fighters' annual meeting in September.
Such legislation, he said, would make any state resident eligible to take any municipality's examination for firefighter.
Union officials representing clerical workers and laborers, however, say that residency requirements should not be eliminated, but should be expanded and more strictly enforced.
 
Question of Fairness
 "If residency's going to be applied one way, it should be applied all ways," said Richard M. Riggs, president of Camden County Council 10 Civil Service Association, the union that represents county and municipal workers in Camden County and the City of Camden.
Mr. Riggs said he believed that if nonuniformed municipal workers were required to be residents to keep their jobs, the same should apply to other city employees like teachers and public safety employees.
"To me, one of the biggest problems of the municipalities is that the higher wage-earners don't live in the city and therefore aren't paying taxes or spending money there," Mr. Riggs said. That, he said, has worked to erode the economic base of the inner cities.
Dr. George Sternlieb, professor emeritus of urban planning at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said residency requirements tended to create a sense of "genuine community" among residents and employees of a municipality.
"The problem when municipal employees live elsewhere is that they really have no feeling for the community other than as an employee," Dr. Sternlieb said. "They may indeed even be alienated from the community."
Residents agree that their towns would be better served if employees had a greater stake in the life of the community by being residents.
 
'Just Burns You Out'
 "When cops and firemen and teachers live in the community where they work, they take more pride in the community," said Mercedes Babot, a Union City homeowner.
"The police can care less if 20 people are on a street corner making noise because they're not going to hear it when they're back in their nice little homes in Bergen County," Ms. Babot said. "And aren't police officers supposed to be on duty 24 hours a day?"
But Terence Gordon, president of Union City's police officers' union, said such expectations were unreasonable. "You're paying a police officer for eight hours," he said, "you're not paying him for 24 hours a day. So why should we be obligated to stay here 24 hours a day?
"Working in the city and living in the city just burns you out," Mr. Gordon said. "I've lived here all my life, but I'm trying to move out now."

Chinatown Dim Sum: A Meal You Build Yourself

 BODY:
Dim sum remains one of the popular brunch choices downtown, and Chinatown is responding with more dim sum restaurants than ever. Over time, aficionados of this genre get to know particular restaurants, each of which has particular dim sum specialties. Some diners hop from place to place in constructing a meal. Here are four good examples of Chinatown's dim sum styles. 
Mandarin Court
61 Mott Street, at Canal Street, (212) 608-3838 -- Dim sum is fun, adventurous and economical: You can order as much or as little as you want and pay accordingly. Mandarin Court is one of the hottest dim sum spots in Chinatown. It is clean and contemporary, with pastel walls, sparkling tiles, sleek black tables and an open kitchen in front. On Sunday, the selection on the dim sum cart is fresh and varied. The dumplings are brightly seasoned and light, filled with sweet shrimp, scallops or delicious sweet-and-sour pork. Other options are turnip cake with Chinese sausage, roasted cubes of eggplant with a sweet hoisin sauce and fried scallops with a black pepper sauce. Some dishes on the menu emphasize minimal frying and lighter sauces: a seafood assortment in a pineapple boat, jumbo shrimp with mango and shrimp and scallops with pine nuts. For dessert, there are vanilla tapioca pudding, black sesame rolls and coconut Jell-O. Dim sum is $1.50 an item, and main courses range from $5.95 to $14.95. Sunday hours are 8 A.M. to midnight; dim sum is served from 8 A.M. to 3 P.M. (Diner's Journal, Feb. 3, 1989.)

 
HSF
 46 Bowery, Canal Street, (212) 374-1319 -- This clattering and colorful restaurant buzzes all day long, from its dim sum breakfast until midnight. The dining room is a gastronomic roller derby, with waiters spinning around the room behind carts overloaded with small portions of dumplings, roast duck, shredded chicken and all manner of shrimp, squid, pork, fish and pastries. The turnover at HSF is fast and furious, so the food is generally hot and fresh when you get it. Dishes on the regular menu include Peking duck, orange beef or chicken and whole roasted sea bass with a sweet-and-sour sauce. Dim sum ranges from $1.60 to $2.75 an item; main courses are $6.95 to $16.95. On Sundays dim sum is from 7:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. (Article, Dec. 23, 1988.) A branch of HSF offers a similar range of food at 578 Second Avenue, between 31st and 32d Streets, (212) 689-6969.

 
King Fung
 20 Elizabeth Street, at Canal Street, (212) 964-5256 -- This restaurant is about as close as you can get in New York to the feeling of a boisterous and colorful establishment in Hong Kong. Large circular tables may be occupied by three or four generations. This can be an amusing place if you are in the right mood, and some dishes on the budget-priced menu are first-rate. On Sundays, a dim sum menu is served for breakfast and lunch. The selection includes beef balls with watercress, steamed pork with bacon, fried shrimp, pork and vegetable dumplings and sweet-and-sour spareribs. Also on the menu are delicious whole Peking duck with pancakes, baked lobster Chinese style with soy sauce, scallions and black beans and whole roasted flounder with a ginger-scallion sauce. Dim sum items range from $1.60 to $2; main courses are $5 to $13. Sunday hours are 8 A.M. to 11 P.M., and dim sum is served from 8 A.M. to 2 P.M. (Article, Dec. 23, 1988.)

 
Oriental Pearl
 103-105 Mott Street, at Canal Street, (212) 219-8388 -- The main dining room at this sprawling 500-seat party palace is a carnival of ceramic statues, dragons with flashing eyes and colored lights. Oriental Pearl serves superior and wide-ranging dim sum for brunch with fried and steamed dumplings (shrimp, scallop, chicken and ham), shrimp cake with chives and spareribs with black bean sauce. Other selections on the regular menu include deep-fried shrimp with walnuts, scallops with black pepper sauce and broccoli, braised goose and taro root casserole and braised duck with mixed vegetables. For dessert, there is the traditional semisweet red bean soup or fruit. Dim sum is $1.60 to $2.95 an item; main courses are $6.95 to $14.95. Sunday service is from 8 A.M. to 11 P.M.; dim sum is served from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. (Review, April 28, 1989.)

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Caution in the Coup's Aftermath

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
It is not quite the same as the Berlin Wall coming down. But the collapse of the hard-line coup in the Soviet Union last week is expected to send a new surge of confidence though Europe, giving some lift to the stock markets in the countries that will play a role in economic development of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
"It is the definitive death of Communism. The political risk of Communism has diminished, and that changes the whole outlook for Europe," said David Roche, international strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company in London. 
 Mr. Roche, who interrupted his vacation because of the coup, is now heading for the Soviet Union. But before he left London, he added to his portfolio to reflect the week's events, buying stocks like Mannesmann in Germany.
The return of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the political victory won by Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin and the humiliating defeat of the old-line Communists mean two things for the equity markets: The general risk factor added on for turmoil in the Soviet Union, especially in markets in Germany and Austria, is lower. Many stocks now will not look as expensive as they might have. And the outlook for capital gains from the development of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is a little better again -- and a bit better balanced.
Market analysts don't expect a headlong rush of often unthinking buying that the market experienced after the Berlin Wall cracked in October 1989. In the sober reassessment since then, investors have learned how long and how risky the wait for those gains might be.
And analysts are quick to point out that the victory is a fragile one. The Soviet economy is in a shambles. If the economic reform does not bear some fruit quickly or if Mr. Gorbachev does not move fast enough, the mood and politics in the country could deteriorate rapidly.
But in the post-coup Soviet Union, with Boris Yeltsin playing a larger, if not equal political role, Mr. Gorbachev will have to move toward real economic development rather than try some faulty hybrid as before. Because of this change, analysts say, investments in the Soviet Union and investments in the companies that invest in the Soviet Union will all look more attractive.
Mr. Roche's bullishness isn't entirely new. In the case of Germany, he is talking his own book a little. He was increasing his investments in Germany earlier this year when many other brokers and fund managers were staying away and telling others to do so.
Still, there's no denying the sudden new allure. "I am sufficiently confident, and this brings us to a more bullish stance," Mr. Roche said.
A flow of capital toward Europe because of the dramatic events in the Soviet Union could also affect investment outlooks in the United States, some analysts believe. For one thing, it could take away some support from the stock markets. It could also weaken the dollar some in the near term.
"How much more potential is there in the U.S. market now compared to Europe over the next couple of months?" asked Jeffrey Loper of A.G. Edwards. His answer: None.
Other analysts also are noting that despite the euphoria following the failed coup, many of the same tired problems that financial markets faced before are still there. And these should not be forgotten.
One is that some markets are still expensive, including the United States and Germany. On the day of the coup, following a burst of panic selling that sent markets sharply down, analysts said that many markets looked better priced as a result of the declines. With the run-up in prices after the Soviet troops withdrew from Moscow and the coup leaders fled, that price advantage has all but evaporated.
By week's end, most of the major markets around the world had regained most or all of their lost ground. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3,040.25, up 72.23 points since the coup. In London, the FT-SE 100 index closed at 2,640.7, a new record high and up 19.7 points since the coup. France's CAC-40 closed at 1,833.45, 13.14 points over the pre-coup level. Germany's DAX 30 index, which was hit the hardest, closed at 1,627.24, just 26.09 points below last Friday's level. Only in Japan, where the Nikkei 225 fell 450.43 Friday, did the index end far below (749 points) the pre-coup level.
Second, despite the Soviet events, the risk of higher interest rates in Germany has not gone away. The Bundesbank rate rise on August 15 clearly left room for ratcheting German rates up another notch.
Also, Japan is still in trouble. Granted, the Nikkei looks less expensive at its present levels, which are not too far above the lows hit during the Persian Gulf crisis. But the country's stock and bank scandals have undermined investor confidence. Tokyo analysts continue to speculate that the scandals could widen and that eventually Japan's Finance Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, might have to resign.
Finally, the failed coup did nothing to alleviate the global shortage of capital. And if the West now begins to put more money into the Soviet Union, which appears to be a necessary element for success in the post-coup environment, it will only add to the strain.

HEADLINE: It Isn't the Paul Mozer They Knew

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
Those who worked closely with Paul W. Mozer during his dazzling 12-year career at Salomon Brothers say they are shocked and baffled by the pivotal role he played in the bond scandal.
Though he traded Government securities with gusto, Mr. Mozer was not perceived, before this month, as a man who would cross the line into illegal or unethical activity. Many of Mr. Mozer's former colleagues said they were reserving judgement until he tells his story. Mr. Mozer, through his attorney, Lee Richards, has declined to comment. 
 But if, as the firm contends, Mr. Mozer submitted illegal bids at Treasury auctions, none of his former colleagues said they could understand why.
Mr. Mozer, a short, soft-spoken man who was the head of Salomon's Government bond desk until being dismissed last weekend, attacked his work as aggressively as he hit tennis balls on the private court outside his spacious weekend home in Sands Point, L.I.
"He runs down every ball he can," said one Salomon trader, who, like the six other current and former Salomon employees interviewed , insisted on anonymity. "He plays until he's exhausted." The trader said Mr. Mozer never resorted to cheating on line calls to win a match. "If anything," the trader said, "he's too lenient to the other guy."
"It's difficult for me to imagine he broke the law," said one Salomon trader. "It's not difficult for me to imagine that he would trade in an aggressive fashion within the boundaries of the law."
Paul William Mozer, who was born on April 23, 1955 in New York City, showed promise at an early age. A second-grade classmate at St. Mary's elementary school in Manhasset, L.I., who also became a Government bond trader, recalled that "he was one of the brightest kids in the class."
One of eight children raised by Robert Mozer, a labor lawyer, and his wife, Patricia, Mr. Mozer once had dreams of becoming a rock-and-roll drummer. He kept his hair long and straggly and enrolled at the Berklee College of Music in Boston in the fall of 1973. But though his interest in rock music has persisted -- a picture of guitar legend Jimi Hendrix was prominently affixed to the side of his desk at Salomon -- he soon decided that he had little talent. He transferred to Whitman College, in Walla Walla, Wash., where he majored in economics, edited the school newspaper and graduated in 1977.
After earning his master's degree at the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern, Mr. Mozer joined Salomon's Chicago office. "Many people didn't like him," said one trader who worked with Mr. Mozer early on. "He set very high standards for himself. He expected a lot from other people."
In the summer of 1983, Mr. Mozer's life underwent two dramatic changes. In June, he married Francine Lee, whom he had met in the Salomon training program four years earlier (and who is now a principal in the fixed-income division at Morgan Stanley & Company).
Then, one month after his wedding, Mr. Mozer was transferred to the Government bond desk of Salomon's New York office.
There, he was admired for his intellect, his mastery of the markets, his shepherding of young traders and his composure under immense pressure. "I think, in the entire world of bond trading, he considered himself the best there is," one former colleague said. "And I think he is every bit as good as he assumed himself to be."
As a current Salomon employee put it, "This was not driven by personal gain, if this is true. There's a game here. And it was a desire to win the game."

How Can We Save New York City?

 BODY:

Ron Silver
Actor and president of the Creative Coalition. 

Reestablish faith in the city's ability to improve things. We are overwhelmed by cynicism and a feeling that we can't do anything. We are able to overcome. There's a lot we could do: Start by reforming the State Legislature. It's corrupt to the bone. Limit legislative terms. Get people reinvolved in city politics. Find a creative solution to the city's racial problems. Get the Federal Government to assume responsibility for Medicaid. Revitalize Midtown. The main thing is to reduce cynicism. A lot of people think New York is a failed enterprise. It isn't.
 
Leonard Stern
Chairman of the Hartz Group.
 
The city has to send a signal to its two crucial industries -- tourism and people in commercial offices -- that New York is safe and attractive. The central business district is roughly the same as the central tourist district. That district has to be kept clean and safe. That's not expensive; it would probably cost less that $50 million a year. It would take a political will, because the outer boroughs would want a share of the budget, but the fact is, most businessmen and most tourists don't visit the outer boroughs.

Richard Ravitch
President of the Citizen's Budget Commission.
 
We must have a five-year fiscal plan involving the city and state that reflects trying honestly for credible, balanced budgets. They would have to include reductions in services and the allocation of the revenue burden, if necessary, to the largest tax base. The city and state have to work in a partnership.
 
Lloyd A. Williams
President of the Uptown Chamber of Commerce.
 
All city employees, especially uniformed employees, must be residents of New York City. Law enforcement officers, in particular, are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but they're only on duty in the city during the workweek. That means that upwards of 70 percent of their call time goes to their own community. There is an economic spinoff of having a police officer living on the block. People feel safer; they will spend more in their neighborhood.

Lady Miss Kier and DJ Dmitry
Members of the rock group Deee-lite.

Instead of warehousing vacant city property with the hope of selling it in a depressed market, encourage the expansion of the homesteading program for hardworking, serious New Yorkers. There are thousands of applicants who are willing to be involved in a 4- to 5-year homesteading program who are turned down because of city policies. It's a permanent solution to homelessness that will boost morale.

Thomas B. Stoddard
Executive director, Lambda Legal Defense Fund.
 
If New York City really wishes to assure its future, it must face up to the issue of poverty. The city should concentrate its efforts on children. Remake the public school system.

Sung Soo Kim
President of the Korean-American Small Business Service Center of New York.

New York's 195,000 small businesses are the backbone of the city: the prime source of neighborhood manpower, taxes -- and they are the first steps of livelihood for new immigrants. City government has made us a cash cow. We need risk-taking, creative leadership rather than a caretaker government.

Danny Wintrode
Hairdresser.
 
If there were more severe punishments, there would be less money spent on jails. The money could be put into more beneficial means of bringing the city back.

Ronald K. Shelp
Head of the New York City Partnership.

We've got to stop living in the past. New York's future has to include restructuring city government, downsizing the work force, new kinds of productivity initiatives and privatization.
Jerrold Nadler
Democratic Assemblyman from Manhattan.

We have to try to regain the city's blue-collar economy by recreating a major port in New York. We can do that by reconnecting the city to the rest of the United States by rail freight. Everything now is transported from New York by truck, and the cost of getting freight in and out of the city by truck is tremendous. It has probably cost us 800,000 to 900,000 jobs in the last 25 years. Despite our natural geographic advantages, the Port of New York lags behind Baltimore and Norfolk, Va.

Stephen Berger
President of Financial Guaranty Insurance Company.
 
What the business community needs most is a sense of stability, predictability and security about the city's future.
 
Mattie Balaj
Manhattan doorman.
 
You could try legalized gambling, but that draws crime and drugs. We need to attract small businesses and factories to the outer boroughs. Then people can work and live in their neighborhoods.

Philip Howard
Lawyer and a vice president of the Municipal Art Society.

 The loss of confidence in New York is the greatest danger to New York's economy. The villain is a city government that seems incapable of adapting or dealing with current problems. Our city government is also notoriously inefficient. The city makes the simplest venture cumbersome and costly. This is true for everyone: a homeless man recently told me he refused to go on welfare because he hated dealing with all the forms.
 
Carol Bellamy
Managing director, Bear Sterns & Company.
 
Multifaceted strategies are needed. Here are two: Streamline government. Improve our schools.
 
Peter P. Smith
President, Partnership for the Homeless.

The city must find ways to translate far more of its vast wealth into a coordinated job training, education and skills development effort. We could start by requiring every service or production business to set aside a certain number of jobs for trainees whom they would train and subsidize until they are ready for full-time employment.

Michael Musto
Night-life columnist for the Village Voice.
 
It would benefit our image and financial state to encourage a booming night life -- one that would pump glamour, excitement and revenue into the city that's always prided itself on having the most dazzling after-hours entertainment. Loosening cabaret laws and zoning regulations that make it difficult to open and run clubs would help maintain our reputation as the city that doesn't sleep. A tax cut would give us a reason to party.

Stanley Aronowitz
Sociology professor, CUNY Graduate Center.
 
 New York is is a first-world city but it is also a third-world city. Because three-quarters of a million factory jobs have been lost in the last two decades, at least a third of the city's residents have no hope and no reason for hope in the future. We need a program to stimulate new small businesses, especially in production industries. City and state government should identify native skills and match them with industrial and market needs; persuade banks to make guaranteed low-interest loans, and impose commercial rent control to make cheap space available.

Penn and Teller
"Penn and Teller Rot in Hell" is at the John Houseman theater in New York.

Penn Jillette: Solving New York City's problems is as easy as solving the nation's problems. Tax the churches and stop wasting money arresting people for victimless crimes. For New York specifically, charge admission to Times Square before it becomes a mall.
 
Teller: As a commuter I don't think there are enough tolls, I know of two stretches of the Sawmill River Parkway where it is almost possible to accelerate to the speed limit before braking for the next quarter-toss. There's money to be had here!

Sandra Feldman
President, United Federation of Teachers.

Invest in the schools and the children who will be in the work force of the 21st century. By cutting more than a half a billion dollars from the city's public schools, New York dealt a terrible blow to the competence of its future work force. Teachers can't turn out educated, adaptable young adults without a reasonable investment.

Dr. Ernest Drucker
Professor of epidemiology and social medicine at Montefiore Medical Center.

New York's immediate economic future is threatened by the related epidemics of AIDS and drug addiction. Both consume vast economic resources: over $1.3 billion for AIDS and over $2 billion for drug addiction. Our failure to offer adequate treatment or AIDS prevention services for the city's 200,000 injecting drug users virtually assures that they will continue to become infected themselves and, often, to infect their wives and children.
 
Joe Dibona
New York City cab driver.
 
Stop pretending there are no classes in this country. The middle class has come down a lot. I was doing better 10 years ago. You have to make it on your own. Nobody gives a damn.

Edwin Rubenstein
Economist, adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute and National Review columnist.

Albany holds the key. I don't mean increased state aid -- that's clearly impossible. The state can, however, ease up on the myriad of costly rules and regulations it imposes on local governments. The most burdensome state mandate is Medicaid. Not only is the state's program egregiously expensive ($4,500 per patient here versus $2,100 per patient in the rest of the nation), but New York is one of the few states that require city governments to contribute anything at all to Medicaid.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference/The Soviet Coup;
Getting the News By Electronic Mail

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
When Esther Dyson got to her Manhattan office early last Monday she found a fax from friends in Siberia saying that despite the political situation, their trip was continuing. Ms. Dyson, publisher of Release 1.0, a leading computer industry newsletter, didn't think anything of it until she got an electronic mail message a few minutes later referring to the dramatic turn of events in Moscow. Then she decided she had better read the newspapers.
Ms. Dyson has a particular stake in the continuing success of Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika. 
 In 1989, she traveled to the Soviet Union to make contacts with people from the country's fledgling personal computer industry. Since then, she has been back to Eastern Europe more than a dozen times in what has become something of a personal crusade. Her goal: to transplant the entrepreneurship of the American PC business to the nascent capitalist economies of the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries.
Ms. Dyson first wrote extensively about developments in Soviet software design, and now publishes Rel-East, a version of her newsletter oriented to Eastern Europe.
She also invited a Soviet group to attend her annual computer industry conference in the United States in 1989. Last year, she held an Eastern European version of the conference in Budapest. The meeting, called the East-West High-Tech Forum, attracted nearly 200 computer executives from throughout Europe and the United States. Ms. Dyson has scheduled a second conference for Warsaw in November.
The failed coup will have a positive impact on Western investors, said Ms. Dyson, who is 40 years old and runs her various enterprises through a company called Edventure Holdings Inc.
"Most of the business people who are over there are delighted that they've put their money in," she said. "Now the stuff people were scared of has happened and has been shown not to be a threat."

HEADLINE: Making a Difference/The Soviet Coup;
The Kremlinologist of Oil

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The coup in Moscow last week briefly revived Kremlinology, the pre-glasnost art of interpreting the Soviet Union from the scattered clues that emerge from a totalitarian facade. One of the experts to whom the American press and the business community turned for guidance was Thane Gustafson, a Georgetown University professor of government.
Mr. Gustafson said that he began his study of Soviet politics in 1964, the year Khrushchev fell, and as a result, "I felt right at home" last week. 
 Mr. Gustafson's specialty is the oil industry, which provides about 70 percent of the Soviet Union's foreign exchange and has lately been in sharp decline.
In a recent book on Soviet oil, "Crisis Amid Plenty," Mr. Gustafson wrote that efforts to maintain production in the late 1970's had sucked up most of the Soviet Union's capital, causing stagnation in the rest of Soviet industry.
Oil continues to be near the heart of the Soviet Union's problems. It is a key source of tension between the republics and the central government over who should control its development. And twice in the last year, Mr. Gustafson said, authorities have "bought off" restive oil workers with extra allocations of imported food and manufactured goods, to the resentment of other workers.
Mr. Gustafson, who is 47, started in the Soviet energy field as an analyst at the Rand Corporation, getting interested when Ronald Reagan put an embargo on natural gas pipeline technology in 1981 after the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
Later, he headed Soviet studies at Georgetown's Center for Strategic and International Studies. A graduate of the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, where he studied political science and chemistry, and a Peace Corps volunteer in the Ivory Coast, he spent the 1970's at Harvard, first getting a doctorate in political science and then teaching.
This month, he began a leave of absence from Georgetown to become the director of Soviet studies at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass.

HEADLINE: Continental, Still Digesting General Tire, Battles Pirelli

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

DATELINE: HANOVER, Germany

 BODY:
Heinrich Huinink, director of tire research at Continental A.G., boasts about the state-of-the-art computer equipment used to design the company's next generation of tires. And he's proud of Continental's commitment to spend 5 percent of its sales -- more than most tire companies -- on research and development this year. But when asked about the tire maker's expenditures for next year, Mr. Huinink hedges: "That all depends on what happens with our company."
Such reservations are fairly common these days at the world's fourth-largest tire producer. While consolidation in the $50 billion global tire industry has reduced capacity by 15 percent in the last decade, tire prices have continued to sag. Continental is still struggling with its 1987 acquisition of General Tire of Akron, Ohio, whose losses cut Continental's earnings by more than half last year, to $62.7 million on sales approaching $6 billion. 
 The biggest uncertainty stems from a year-long takeover tussle with Pirelli S.p.A. of Italy, the world's fifth-largest tire maker. The Pirelli question has divided the Continental board; cost a chief executive, who refused to consider the proposal, his job; demoralized the work force and left customers in the lurch.
Now, the problems sit squarely in the lap of Hubertus von Grunberg, who took over as Continental's chief executive last month. The 48-year-old Mr. von Grunberg, formerly president and chief executive of ITT Automotive Inc., is not forthcoming about just how he plans to see Continental through its crisis, although the need for clarity is undeniable.
"Uncertainty about Continental's future has the risk of costing us management talent in every rank," Mr. von Grunberg said. "And if our people don't get frustrated and insecure enough to quit, they are certainly too concerned about the future of their jobs to care about beating the competition and serving the customer."
Mr. von Grunberg says he intends to meet with customers to assure them of the company's stability. Otherwise, he said, "our customers might feel they prefer Michelin and Goodyear."
But his most pressing mission is to resolve the Pirelli affair. "We have to get this thing settled one way or another," he said.
People at Continental are sure Mr. von Grunberg is more partial to some sort of cooperative agreement than to a merger. The idea of taking on additional debt at a time when tire prices are weak and General Tire is still a drain is not very appealing. And few of the other tire mergers of the late 80's have yet to pay off in increased profits.

BUT Mr. von Grunberg may have trouble keeping Continental independent. Pirelli has been a tenacious suitor. Last September, itproposed that the German tire maker buy its tire business in an unusually convoluted and complex deal for roughly 2 billion deutsche marks, more than $1 billion. Although the German company would be financing the takeover, Pirelli would have had controlling interest of Continental. It contends that because neither company holds more than 8 percent of the world tire market, a merger is necessary for survival. A merger, it claims, would create total, one-time cost savings of more than $600 million.
Horst Urban, then Continental's chief executive, rejected the proposal, claiming that projected savings were vastly exaggerated. Besides, he said, Continental was already achieving efficiency on its own with recent acquisitions in Sweden, Portugal and Britain and expansions in western and eastern Europe. It is now talking with producers in Czechoslovakia and Poland about alliances.
Spurned, Pirelli formed an investor group to buy a controlling interest in Continental's stock. It now holds 5 percent of Continental's shares and claims that another 46 percent are in friendly hands.
In response, the German tire maker put together its own backers to form a defense pool that includes Daimler-Benz, Allianz and Volkswagen, which together hold 25 percent of Continental's stock.
In a major victory for Pirelli, Continental's shareholders refused at the annual meeting earlier this year to approve an amendment to the German tire maker's bylaws limiting voting rights to shareholders with at least a 5 percent share. And when Mr. Urban threatened to resign unless the board supported every effort to deter Pirelli, the directors, apparently unhappy with what they saw as an uncompromising attitude, accepted his resignation.
To be sure, a combination of Continental and Pirelli would create some notable strengths. Continental is particularly strong in central and eastern Europe and has a significant foothold in North America -- all areas where Pirelli is relatively weak. And Continental is the leading supplier of both truck and passenger tires to Mercedes, Volkswagon and BMW, supplying about 40 percent of their needs.
Pirelli, in turn, dominates the Italian and southern European markets and has an important position in South America. It has also carved a sizable piece of the high-performance niche -- it supplies about 15 percent of the worldwide market for racing and sports-car tires.
But Mr. Urban, chief executive of Continental for four of his 17 years with the company, argued that some of Pirelli's plants were in worse shape than Continental's and that combining the two companies would provide more problems than it might solve. "The tire market is going down everywhere in the world because of heavy cost problems, overcapacity and major losses," he said in a recent interview. "Any student of business knows that you don't do such a combination under such weak economic circumstances. It should be done when the market is in an upswing."
Continental executives were also discouraged by the results of other giant combinations in the industry. In large part because of its 1988 acquisition of the Chicago-based Firestone Tire & Rubber Company, Japan's Bridgestone saw its earnings fall by half last year. Investments by Groupe Michelin of France into modernizing and streamlining Uniroyal-Goodrich of Akron, which it bought in 1989, contributed to a big loss in 1990.
With its aging plants and less-than-stellar efficiency, General Tire has also been a drag on Continental's earnings. Without General Tire's losses, Continental's decline in earnings would have been relatively minor. (Even so, Continental's earnings have still been better than most of its rivals.) Declining auto output and price competition in the United States is expected to translate into a $100 million loss at General Tire this year.
"Continental also tried very hard to move General more aggressively into selling their brand labels into the replacement market and de-emphasizing private labels," said Harry W. Millis, an independent tire analyst in Akron. "That didn't work very well."
Pirelli has similar problems. Outbid by Bridgestone in an effort to buy Firestone, Pirelli settled instead for Armstrong Tire -- at the time, the fifth-largest American tire producer. Pirelli's earnings dropped 52 percent last year, leading to a management shakeup. In June, Pirelli's board forced out the managing director and the general manager of its tire sector.
Together, the mergers have done little to restore the industry to health. Mr. Millis estimates that there is still about 20 percent excess capacity in North America and 15 percent in Europe. As a result, car producers, hit by sagging demand in the United States and some areas of Europe, have been able to drive down tire prices by more than 20 percent in the last year.
And a merger of Pirelli and Continental would do little to reduce overcapacity because the two companies' operations have little overlap. "There is no reason to believe that the combination would bring any more control over pricing than any of the other mergers," said Stephen M. Reitman, an analyst with UBS Phillips & Drew Ltd. in London.

MEANWHILE, Mr. von Grunberg's appointment has sent mixed signals about the board's intentions. Mr. Urban's ouster signaled to many that Continental wanted to further explore talks with Pirelli. Still, Mr. von Grunberg's vast experience as a senior industrial executive makes it unlikely that he would be summoned to prepare Continental to submit to a merger.
For his part, Mr. von Grunberg grudgingly admits that there are economies of scale to be achieved from some form of combination. "There are probably some ways in which there could be benefits from some sort of cooperation," he said.
There are those who agree. "Depending on what a combination represents," said Stanley C. Gault, chairman of Goodyear, "it could result in a stronger competitor."
Mr. von Grunberg insists that he was attracted to the job largely by the prospect of Continental's independence. "On the other hand," he said, "once you take a job, you can only look forward and not be too selfish. You have to live up to your responsibility to the shareholders, the customers and the employees. If I am convinced that their best interest requires me to be in a situation that is not ideal for myself, I would consider accepting it."
 
 
 
A NEW MAN TAKES ON THE ITALIAN CHALLENGE
 While Hubertus von Grunberg talks as though he is willing to consider all possible linkages with Pirelli, he is a man who, at the same time, speaks enthusiastically about the prospect of leading an independent Continental. "The tire industry, to put it mildly, is not the world's most profitable industrial segment," he said. "And this was one of the challenges in taking this job."
Mr. von Grunberg was born in 1943 in Swinemunde, East Prussia, which is now part of Poland. He studied mathematics and physics at the University of Cologne and joined ITT Automotive Inc. in 1971 at its brake-making subsidiary, Alfred Teves G.m.b.H. in Frankfurt.
He brings to Continental a reputation as a top-notch industrial manager with extensive experience in both the international and German automotive markets. Before becoming president and chief executive of ITT, he worked in Brazil and in the United States in various industrial management jobs with the company.
"Mr. von Grunberg is an internationally minded executive who is completely familiar with the automotive business in Europe and America," said Dennis Phillips, a spokesman for Commerzbank A.G. in Frankfurt. "Given the brutal international competition and price wars in the tire market, that is a good thing for Continental. The trend in the tire business is clearly toward internationalization, and I think he was picked to take them in that direction."
Although many analysts have insisted that his appointment signaled a shift in Continental's attitude toward a merger, Mr. von Grunberg is vehement about the fact that he has no hidden agenda. "There are no marching orders, no hidden agenda," he added. "I am truly open to anything."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
More Eggs, in Balanced Baskets

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Investors, if you're agonizing over which mutual fund to buy, relax: Picking a single fund isn't nearly as important as building a solid portfolio of funds.
Funds, investing as they do in various securities, are diverse by nature. Putting your money in a variety of them, then, just adds to the diversity, smoothing out rough market ups and downs. The two keys: allocating assets to suit your wants and needs, and taking the long view -- a particularly important exercise as volatility becomes a fixture in the financial markets. 
 The idea behind asset allocation is simple: dividing a portfolio among a variety of investments to reduce risk and increase total return. "Most people tend to ignore the whole concept," said Gerald W. Perritt, an investment adviser and editor of the Mutual Fund Letter in Chicago. In fact, many investors own a hodge-podge of funds bought at various times without much thought as to how the agglomeration of funds complement each other.
As for the long view, it may be a rare bird who bought in 1926 and held through 1990, but as the chart shows, there are distinct patterns among investments.
All the broad categories beat inflation in the 65-year period covered, but some a lot more than others. The basic investing rule: the greater the risk, the greater the return. Low-risk United States Government bonds earned only 1.7 percent each year after inflation. That is why investment advisers urge long-term investors to keep a big chunk of their holdings in higher-risk, higher-yield stocks. In that category, the highest-risk is small-company stocks, which outdid inflation by 13.9 percentage points. Careful, though. The return is skewed by a whopping 142.9 percent gain recorded in 1933; so if you weren't invested as the Depression ended, you missed a bit.
On the other hand, while a bust year in stocks can make the slow-but-steady bond look like a good thing, bonds are actually riskier than stocks in some shorter periods, according to Kenneth E. Gregory, an investment adviser in San Francisco and editor of the L/G No-Load Fund Analyst. Over 50 five-year periods since 1929, some of which overlap each other in part, stocks returned 7.2 percent after inflation. Bonds gained only six-tenths of 1 percent and trailed inflation 40 percent of the time. Meanwhile, stocks trailed inflation only 20 percent of the time and beat bonds in 82 percent of the periods.
All depends, of course, on the chunk of money available to invest and your stomach for risk. For conservative investors who can tolerate occasional yearly losses of 5 percent, the best bet is a portfolio of one-third stocks and two-thirds bonds, Mr. Gregory says. For investors who can tolerate a rare year when losses exceed 10 percent -- say, once every 25 years -- stocks should make up 70 percent of the portfolio, he says.
Mr. Perritt recommends that investors split their holdings among six types of assets: domestic and international stocks and bonds, gold and money-market funds.
As a rule of thumb, two or three funds in each of the six basic categories is plenty. By getting into too many, investors end up owning the entire market. And for market rates of return, investors are better off buying index funds because they usually have much lower expenses.
The returns for different classes of assets rarely move in tandem, meaning you can choose how to balance one likely performance against another. Mr. Parritt built a matrix to illustrate the point. A score of 1 means that two investments tend to move in tandem. The farther from 1, the more diverse the movements.
He found a relatively high correlation of .66 between foreign and domestic stocks, and a lesser correlation of .50 between foreign bonds and United States Government bonds. Domestic stocks and bonds scored .40, and small-company stock versus large capitalization stocks, .70.
Domestic bonds and gold have a correlation of minus .30 percent, meaning they tend to move in opposite directions. Thus, Mr. Perrit recommends that bond fund investors keep a small amount of their portfolios in gold funds, as insurance.
Mr. Gregory says that within the stock-fund portion of the portfolio, investors may also want to consider mixing investment styles. For middle-of-the road investors, he would divide stock fund holdings among four categories.
Among value funds, Mr. Gregory likes Gabelli Asset, Selected American Shares, and Mutual Beacon. Among small-company funds, he likes GIT Equity Special, Nicholas Limited Edition and Babson Enterprise. He also recommends three aggressive earnings growth funds -- Brandywine, 20th Century Heritage, Janus Venture -- and one conservative growth fund -- Counsellors Capital Appreciation.
After constructing a portfolio of funds, an investor should monitor its progress and adjust it as needed -- selling that which has appreciated most, buying that which hasn't yet performed. Mr. Perritt says once a year is enough; anything more than quarterly smacks of overactive trading.

HEADLINE: The Strange Case of the Czech Crown

 BODY:
To the Editor:
News media reports imply that politicians in Czechoslovakia are holding up conversion to a free-market economy for fear of being tossed out of office. I recently made a one-week trip for a scientific conference in Prague (where I studied medicine 50 years ago) and saw a different and far more complex reality. 
 The new regime in Prague contains no Communists and is eager to add free exchange of goods to the unhampered free exchange of ideas. The problem is how to bridge the gulf between an economy operating in Czechoslovak crowns and the economies of the Western countries.
Internally, the economy is capable of feeding its people and maintaining a high level of artistic, literary and scientific output. A professor at Charles University and his working wife can live and entertain foreign visitors in his pleasant home at a salary of 5,000 crowns a month, buying new hardbound books for 35 crowns, paying 2 crowns for the Prague subway or other public transportation. Internally, 1 crown is about equal to $1.
However, the rate of exchange is 30 crowns to $1. A daily newspaper printed in Western Europe costs 35 crowns.
To introduce free exchange of goods with Western Europe would require raising Czechoslovak salaries and prices thirtyfold to maintain the current standard of living. Not only foreign investments, but also foreign cash would be needed for such a move. If we truly believe a free market economy solves the problems introduced by Communism, small Czechoslovakia would be an ideal laboratory for proving that proposition.
The Czechoslovaks have a democratic tradition going back to Jan Hus, burned at the stake in 1415 for preaching in Czech against the sale of indulgences by papal representatives in Prague. Czechoslovakia was a model capitalistic democracy during its independence (1918-38). Its 12 million people have the reputation of being hard-working realists.
The necessary foreign funds would be a fraction of the $100 billion said to be needed to save the Soviet economy. At a cost of, say, $9 billion, a Czechoslovak Marshall Plan would be a virtually sure bet to serve as a model for conversion to a free market economy in neighboring Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union.
The onetime expenditure would equal 3 percent of our annual military budget.

Your Aug. 6 report on the changes made in India by the new Prime Minister, P. V. Narasimha Rao, contains misleading implications. 
 You describe the "hallowed traditions" on which modern India was founded as "mainly the virtues of state socialism." This is inaccurate. India has always been a capitalist democracy. Leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru were avowed socialists, but socialists in the Western European sense: committed democrats who believed in state intervention to humanize some of the ills of capitalism.
More important, you describe India's economy as in "desperate straits," or as a "collapsing system." India indeed has a serious balance-of-payment problem, but such descriptions are nonsense. India's economy grew at nearly 5 percent a year through the 1980's, including last year. Industrial growth in this period was well above 7 percent, nearing 8 percent in 1990. Inflation has been high by Indian standards (approximately 9 percent a year in 1985-90), but minuscule compared with, say, many Latin American countries.
Exports have grown at more than 5 percent a year in the last decade, and domestic food production has been satisfactory. This is not a dazzling performance, and much is wrong with the Indian economy: an inefficient public sector, excessive government controls, large budget deficits and massive poverty. But this does not add up to a collapsing economy.
You lament India's economic performance compared with its "dynamic Asian neighbors." If Japan and the East Asian dragons are the global growth yardstick, India pales in comparison -- but so does the United States and much of the rest of the world. In the third world, India's economic performance is middling, rather than poor; well behind East Asia's, but it compares very favorably with much of Africa's and, during the debt-ridden 1980's, was better than that of most Latin American countries.
It is fashionable to tie "economic failure" to government intervention and socialism, and to look to market liberalism and unobtrusive states for "economic success." The reality is more complex.

HEADLINE: PLAN TO DEVELOP AMAZON A FAILURE

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ARIQUEMES, Brazil

 BODY:
Fifteen years ago, Maria Luisa de Oliveira Dias hiked down a jungle trail here to claim a 250-acre wood lot under an ambitious plan to colonize the Amazon.
Today, she wishes she had never left her home in southern Brazil. Plantings of corn and rice withered in the sandy soil. Rubber trees never produced latex. And coffee prices are so low that income this year for her family of four adults will be less than $1,000. 
 A decade after the World Bank helped pave a road through a stretch of wilderness that became Rondonia state, Brazil's most ambitious Amazon colonization plan has failed.
"People are abandoning the countryside," Francisco Jose Silveira Pereira, the state Environmental Secretary, said in the state capital, Porto Velho. "In 1980, Rondonia was 70 percent rural. Today, it is 60 percent urban."
 
Lured by Promises
 In the 1970's and 1980's, Government promises of free land lured more than 100,000 farm families from overcrowded areas of southern Brazil, the nation's breadbasket. In the ensuing land rush, about one quarter of Rondonia was stripped of trees, and imported disease decimated the Indian population, which dropped from 35,000 in 1965 to 6,000 today.
But countering Government predictions, only 9 percent of this Colorado-sized state proved capable of sustaining agriculture. Today, Mr. Pereira estimated, about 60 percent of the cleared area is being lost to brush and secondary growth forest.
"For the first time, you drive around the colonization areas and see abandoned farms and 'for sale' signs," said John O. Browder, a regional planning professor at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, who has been studying one municipality, Rolim de Moura, for the last decade. "Overgrown fields are now the dominant feature of the rural landscape."
 
The Season for Burning
 Wim Groenveld, a Dutch ecologist who runs an environmental study center in Porto Velho, said: "There are not many new roads opening up, not many new settlements. The newcomers have seen it is not worthwhile." Indeed, as the annual burning season now begins in the Western Amazon, the acrid wood scent hanging in the air comes largely from landowners' burning brush to keep fields open for pastureland.
From the open door of a helicopter flying on a recent afternoon near Porto Velho, a wall of fire and smoke could be seen advancing across a field cluttered with bushes and scrub trees.
"That's all second growth," Alberto Paraguassu, state coordinator of a federal Amazon fire-prevention program, shouted over the clattering rotors of the helicopter rented by Brazil's Environmental Protection Agency.
Indeed, world concern over Amazon deforestation has reached here, accelerating an end to Rondonia's frenetic, frontier atmosphere.
 
Frustrated by Controls
 Citing environmentl pollution, Rondonia's new Governor, Osvaldo Piana, shut down mining operations in two areas this month: gold mining by 300 barges on a 125-mile section of the Madeira River near Porto Velho and tin mining here at Bom Futuro, the world's largest tin mine.
"The Government doesn't let us cut the timber," Jose Scarmocin, a tin mine operator, complained, echoing a growing frustration with environmental controls. "Now we can't work the mine. What can we do?"
Logging continues in areas where Indian leaders have sold timber rights, largely in reserves of the Surui and of the Cinta Larga. But the state government is installing a satellite monitoring system to detect invasions of Indian lands. To help analysts of satellite photographs, boundary lines that cross forest are to be demarcated by clearings spaced every mile.
"The Surui are addicted to timber sales," said Mr. Pereira, whose environmental reponsibilities include Indian affairs. "But the Uru-eu-wau-wau ask us to get the white man out of their area."
Contributing to grumbling by some white settlers, the 700 survivors of the Uru-eu-wau-wau tribe are winning legal recognition of rights to a 7,075-square-mile reserve.
"Today, agriculture in the state is practically bankrupt, and in the mining sector, there is total anarchy with mines abruptly closed," the state's largest newspaper, O Estadao, complained in a front-page editorial. "Now we are suffering from this plague of the 'untouchable Amazon forest.' "

Riverfront Clubs Bloom

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE

 BODY:
FINANCING difficulties may be stalling much of the residential and office development on the Delaware River, but a former industrial area is blossoming with new restaurants and nightclubs.
One of the new clubs, the $1 million Katmandu, an outdoor restaurant and bar, was a response to the recession by two developers, Lance Silver and Stuart Harting of Philadelphia. It opened in mid- May on Delaware Avenue. A Katmandu partner, David Preefer, said recreation is a natural use for the river's edge about a mile east of the central business district. 
 Farther north on Delaware Avenue, the Beach Club, a bar and restaurant, has a sandy volleyball court in the shadow of a former sugar refinery and dormant warehouse stores.
And Dale Lalwani, owner of the neighboring Aztec Club, plans to build a restaurant and miniature golf course in the section of Delaware Avenue north of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. Mr. Lalwani refitted a former warehouse as a 6,600-square-foot dance club complete with a smoke-breathing dragon. He said he felt the area "would be the next to develop because overhead is low and parking is not a problem."
South of the bridge, bracketing the 37-acre, mixed-use Penn's Landing site, one of two high-rise housing projects Portside and Liberty Landing, appears highly doubtful. The developer of the projected 286-unit Portside residential condominium, Asbell & Associates of Philadelphia, once the lead partner in the Penn's Landing complex, for the present plans to build only a $6 million floating restaurant at Penn's Landing.
Down payments by Portside condominium buyers have been returned and Asbell is suing its lender, Equibank, saying it failed to honor a commitment to provide working capital and loan extensions for the project. Portside itself is on the back burner because of a lack of funds.
The $300 million Liberty Landing, a mixed-use project, is being redesigned by its developers, a consortium of riverfront landowners, to moderate its elements as well as what it will ask for its apartments.
Rick Widerman, director of urban leasing for Bell Atlantic Properties, said his firm is developing a master plan for the four piers it owns north of the bridge. He said the nightclubs have made the waterfront a regular part of Philadelphia life.
"A funny thing has happened," Mr. Widerman said. "The time for the waterfront has arrived, but the time for large-scale development has passed."

HEADLINE: TENSION IN BROOKLYN;
For Young Blacks, Alienation and a Growing Despair Turn Into Rage

BYLINE: By Felicia R. Lee; This article is based on reporting by Felicia R. Lee and Sara Rimer and was written by Ms. Lee.

 BODY:
It was late at night in the Albany Houses project in Crown Heights when a group of young black men got the word that a white man had killed a black child.
"Someone said, 'let's go,' " said Lance, a 19-year-old resident of the project who refused to give his last name. He and his friends headed for Utica Avenue and President Street, the scene of the car accident that had killed the child. "I helped flip over a police car," Lance said. "It made me feel like I scored a point. One of the guys I was with yelled at one of the cops that was there, 'You want to see how strong the black man is?' "
 
A Chance to Express Rage
 For Lance and for many others in Crown Heights last week, the disturbance was a chance to express their rage. 
 Some of the more than 30 young black Crown Heights residents interviewed on Friday said they had thrown rocks and bottles in protest over the death on Monday of Gavin Cato, the black child hit by a car driven by a Hasidic Jew. Others said they were retaliating against the police because of unfair treatment in the past. Some said it was simply something to do on a summer night.
Others did not participate in the violence but said they were in the streets to protest the circumstances of their lives: the joblessness, the poor schools, the ever-present violence. They said they felt alienated from most New Yorkers.
 A few said that they had stayed home, that they condemned the violence and that they were trying to continue with their everyday lives.
 
Grievances Against Whites
 But in conversation after conversation, men and women in their early 20's, teen-agers and younger children expressed the feeling that "they" -- meaning whites in general -- have lives vastly superior to their own.
They contend this is true because white people get special breaks and because blacks are discriminated against. For them, the relative prosperity of the Hasidim -- the white people with whom they are in closest contact -- bears out that notion.
Young men talked of white women clutching their purses when they approached, of joblessness, of police brutality and of the lack of fathers in families. Young women talked of men who took out their frustrations on them, of the pains of early motherhood and of schools where they did not learn much except low self-esteem. Both men and women said they felt that they had far fewer opportunities than white people, and that they believed people outside their community looked down on them.
 
'When We See Blue, We Get Mad'
 For many, the greatest enemy of all are the police, because they are considered the symbol of a repressive and hostile white society.
"I'm sorry; I just don't like white people," Lance said. A graduate of Boys and Girls High and the father of two, Lance said he learned to hate whites in prison in upstate New York, where he said he was recently released after serving nearly two years for attempted murder. Most of the guards were white, he said, and they treated him badly.
"We're black," said Jeff, a 20-year-old born in Martinique who grew up and lives in Crown Heights. He would also not give his last name. "When we see blue, we get mad."
"There's a lot of things people don't know," said Jeff, a high school dropout who reads the works of Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X. "The jails are awful and they're full of young black kids," he said. "This isn't against the Jews. It's against the police."
 
The Views of a Group of Boys
 Seven boys, 12 to 14 years old, were sitting on a stoop in the neighborhood Friday afternoon, talking and laughing about the last few nights. They bragged about throwing rocks and bottles. None gave their names.
"It made me feel strong because we were with a lot of black people," a 12-year-old said.
"It was fun, throwing bottles at the cops," a 13-year-old said. The boys said they had studied the civil rights movement in school, but they seemed to have little identification with it. Asked what they thought of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a 13-year-old said: "I don't admire him. He let black people get beat up."
On an ordinary summer night, the boys said, they would have been home watching television or hanging out on the stoop. The disturbance gave them something to do.
Indeed, there are very few things for youths to do in the neighborhood. "You'd like to go to the park and take out some frustration on the basketball court, but there are no rims on the court," said Henry Rice, a 22-year-old who said he escaped his environment by joining the Coast Guard, where he is now in the Reserves.
"Some of these people have nothing to lose, so they go for it," he said. "I have a lot of lose. I have a daughter. I can't do her any good in jail."
A 12-year-old, who said she had hurled bricks at the police, described most of the rioters as boys trying to act like men.
"But they not no men," she insisted. "They treat females like dirt. You get a baby by these guys and the next day they don't know your name."
 
Violence Hits Many Families
 Mr. Rice said many young rioters were not afraid of the police or anyone else. He said many had seen their friends and family members killed on the streets of Brooklyn.
As for the contention that they are destroying their own community, Mr. Rice said many young adults had little regard for the graffiti-scarred and gang-infested places they are forced to call home.
Many of those interviewed lead lives almost as insular as those of the Hasidic Jews, whose religion severely circumscribes their interaction with society. Poverty and segregation mean that many young blacks do not know any white people, that some have never traveled to Manhattan or visited a museum, and that many do not know anyone they consider successful.
"We can't win for losing with this system," said Monique Peterson, 19, who was hit in the ankle by a brick during one riot. "I don't know too many people making it out there."
Others said few public officials visit their neighborhoods except when something bad happens, and they have few opportunities to express their feelings about anything. The recession that has hurt middle-class New Yorkers has devastated their already-struggling neighborhood and cut off Federal dollars for youth programs and community development.
"It's hell," said Scott Coleman, an unemployed 20-year-old. "Unemployment, first of all. As soon as they see you with a dark complexion, you're no good. If you're a black baby, you're marked.
"I was raised by just my mother," Mr. Coleman said. "My father was down south in Alabama. No visits, no support. I didn't go no further than high school. My mind wasn't set to it. I just didn't feel I was ready for it."
Mr. Coleman recalled that as a ninth-grader at George Wingate High School, he was arrested, charged with assault and held in jail for hours. Even though he was released after the police acknowledged that they had arrested the wrong person, he said he felt sullied and vulnerable.
"All the police knew that it was a black man in a black skin," he said of his arrest. "People are just tired of it -- tired of feeling they're being pushed around. It's a shame you've got to wait for something like this to happen to express your feelings."
For Tracy Belton, who grew up in Crown Heights with her mother and three brothers -- she has not seen her father in 10 years -- the disturbance was a political protest. She did not particpate in the violence, but she was angry because of her belief that Hasidic Jews get preferential treatment.
Ms. Belton, a 21-year-old junior at Long Island University, concedes that for others it was simply a chance to express anger against the police.
"There can be a group of guys on the corner and a cop car can go by and throw people against the wall and arrest them for no reason," Ms. Belton said. She said things became so bad that two of the brothers left New York City for South Carolina.
 
Rare Chance to Be Heard
 Jeff, who dreams of being a hotel manager in Martinique, said a meeting at Medgar Evers College that called Friday by the Crown Heights Youth Collective provided him with a rare chance to be heard.
"The American Dream is something you see on TV," he said. "But you can't have it. I've worked in restaurants, doing housekeeping, construction, making $200 a week. Some of my friends are making $200 a day selling drugs. Who's the better man?"
Jeff seemed sad, as did many of the other young people interviewed.
"I'm lost," he said as he walked away. "I don't know what I'm doing."

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
GORBACHEV QUITS AS PARTY HEAD; ENDS COMMUNISM'S 74-YEAR REIGN

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 24

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev resigned today as the head of the Communist Party, disbanded its leadership and in effect banned the once monolithic party from any role in ruling the vast country over which it had held iron control for more than seven decades.
With Communism under brutal assault across the Soviet Union and his own leadership in shambles in the aftermath of a coup attempt, Mr. Gorbachev abandoned his efforts to defend party leaders who had obviously collaborated in the putsch and finally dealt the party a fatal blow. 
 By doing so, Mr. Gorbachev seemed to be seeking some way of remaining a credible political force, something that would have been impossible if he had not repudiated the party.
 
Committee Replaces Cabinet
 In a series of terse statements and decrees read on the evening television program "Vremya," the President also ordered the Cabinet of Ministers, the inner government council, to resign. He then created a committee headed by the Premier of the Russian federated republic, Ivan Silayev, a close aide of the republic's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, to take charge of the national economy.
This was part of an arrangement worked out by Mr. Yeltsin, who has emerged as the country's leading political figure since the coup attempt.
The committee includes Grigory V. Yavlinsky, a leading advocate of radical economic change in the country, auguring the long-awaited introduction of a sharp turn to a free-market economy. Other members of the committee are Arkady Volsky, head of an association of private and state-owned enterprise, and Yuri Luzhkov, a supporter of fundamental change who is head of the Moscow city council.
 
Surrender to Liberals
 The moves, announced at the end of another day filled with emotional and fast-paced developments arising from the coup, signaled a virtually complete surrender by Mr. Gorbachev to the liberal and democratic forces who had defied the coup and rescued him.
The actions were accompanied by continued turmoil in the Soviet republics, as Mr. Yeltsin accorded formal recognition to the independence of two more Baltic republics and the Parliament of the Ukraine, the nation's second-largest republic, delcared its independence and set a referendum for Dec. 1 to endorse it.
Mr. Gorbachev also ordered the Soviet Parliament to take all Communist Party property into custody until its future was decided "in strict compliance with Soviet and republican law."
Mr. Gorbachev did not disband the Communist Party, nor did he say he was resigning from the party himself. But in sweeping out its leadership, handing its vast properties to the mercies of democratically elected parliaments and thrusting it out of all federal government and security organs, he in effect decapitated the 15 million-member organization and left it to find its own place in the new order.
The dramatic gesture followed a broad campaign against the party that had already seen its headquarters sealed in Moscow and across the entire country, its major newspapers closed and its organization banned entirely in Moldavia and the Baltic republics. Leningrad had sealed off the party headquarters at the Smolny Institute, a site charged with symbolism as the place where Lenin had his first headquarters.
In Moscow, Mr. Yeltsin, the acknowledged leader of the liberal and democratic forces now in ascendance, issued a decree sealing the archives of the K.G.B., the Interior Ministry and the military.
Mr. Gorbachev's actions came after an emotion-charged day in which tens of thousands of Muscovites turned out to bury three men killed in the coup, The nationally televised ceremonies seemed almost a funeral for the old order.
Against this background, Mr. Gorbachev's announcement, read by a newsreader on the evening television news, had the quality of a full surrender by the old order.

 
 In the statement read over television after he reportedly met with the party leadership for several hours in an undisclosed location, since the Central Committee building was now not in his hands, Mr. Gorbachev based his actions on the party leadership's complicity or silence during the coup.

 
 "The Secretariat, the Politburo and the Communist Party's Central Committee did not take a stand against the coup d'etat," the statement began. "The Central Committee did not manage to take a firm position of condemnation and opposition. It did not inspire Communists to fight against the trampling of constitutional law.
"Among the conspirators were members of the party leadership," it said. "A number of party committees and the mass media supported the action of the state criminals. This placed millions of Communists in a false position."
But the President also defended the rank-and-file membership, as he had done twice since his return from house arrest in the Crimea, in effect appealing to the nation not to carry out a witch hunt against all party members.
"Many members of the party refused to collaborate with the conspirators, condemned the coup and joined in the fight against it," he said. "No one has the right to blame all Communists, and I, as President, consider it my duty to defend them as citizens from unfounded accusations."
 
Central Committee Disbanded
 In this situation, Mr. Gorbachev continued, the Central Committee, whose 300 members make up the inner circle of the party, "must take the difficult but honest decision to disband itself."
The fate of republican and local organizations, he continued, "should be decided by themselves."
He then declared: "I consider it no longer possible to continue to carry out my duties as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and I relinquish corresponding authority."
Mr. Gorbachev concluded with the hope that "democratically minded Communists" would work toward the creation of a new party "capable, together with all progressive forces, of actively joining in the continuation of fundamental democratic reforms for the sake of working people."
In a pair of decrees read after the announcement, Mr. Gorbachev dealt what was in effect the death blow to the party.
 
All Parties Are Curbed
 He ordered an end to all actions by political parties and movements in the military, the security forces, the K.G.B. and the apparatus of government. All members of political parties and political movements, he decreed, could continue their political activities only outside these organs and on their own time.
In a second decree, Mr. Gorbachev ordered parliamentary deputies to take custody of all property of the Communist Party. Its ultimate fate, he said, would be decided according to the laws of the Soviet Union and the republics.
That in effect opened the way for the nationalization of all the party's vast holdings, since Russia and many other republics have already signaled their intention to seize party property. These include innumerable office buildings, luxury hotels, printing plants, residences and vacation homes, many of which have been put to commercial use in recent years to compensate for falling membership and to earn hard currency for party coffers.
The wealth of a party that argued so fervently at the same time against privatization or private property was a major source of growing public wrath with the Communists.
 
Entrenched in Government
 The death knell of the party as the dominant force in the Soviet Union sounded after a long and tortuous decline during the six years of Mr. Gorbachev's perestroika, during which it steadily lost authority but remained entrenched in virtually every branch of the central Government.
Only a month ago, Mr. Gorbachev presided at a Central Committee meeting at which virtually every hallowed principle of the party was jettisoned, down to the sanctity of Marxism-Leninism.
All the while Mr. Gorbachev himself continued to cling to the faith in which he was raised, arguing again and again that he was born a Communist and would die a Communist. Even when his closest advisors, men like Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Aleksandr A. Yakovlev, were denounced and quit the party, he remained at its helm, arguing that it could be renewed.
And even in the immediate aftermath of the coup, at his first new conference and in an appearance before the Russian Parliament, Mr. Gorbachev declared that he remained loyal to "socialist choice," that not all Communists could be held repsonsible.
 
A Historic Force Collapses
 Though long in coming, the stripping of the party of its last grips on Soviet power signaled the end of an experiment that began in the flames of the Russian Revolution and spread to become a dominant historic force in the shaping of the 20th century, eventually giving in to the corrupting forces of unchallenged power, and under Stalin the Communist Party turned into an instrument of terror, repression and totalitarian control.
Last in a long line of leaders who believed in the possibility of returning the party to what was seen as its original purity, Mr. Gorbachev came to power in 1985 promising to inject openness and democracy into the party. But the forces he set loose soon began to prey on his own support.
Instead of presiding over the renewal of the party, Mr. Gorbachev ended up presiding over its extended death throes as one after another its legends and prerogatives fell. In the end, the party turned on Mr. Gorbachev himself, as his comrades engineered the coup,
Finally forced to disband the party leadership and to purge his Government, Mr. Gorbachev in effect left himself with no source of power, unless he can find some in the Soviet Parliament when it meets next week. But in the rout of Kremlin forces after the coup, it was unlikely that many deputies could be mustered to oppose the steamroller of the Yeltsin supporters.
The inclusion of Mr. Volsky, an ally of Mr. Gorbachev, in the new economic team was viewed as a bow to the President. But Mr. Volsky has also been an advocate of market reform and has maintained close contacts with liberal forces.
The appointment of Mr. Silayev as chairman of a committee to manage the national economy was viewed as a prelude to his nomination as prime minister when the Soviet Parliament convenes.
The inclusion of Mr. Yavlinsky signaled that the new government would move rapidly toward the radical reforms that the young economist had proposed in the "500 day" plan rejected by Mr. Gorbachev a year ago, and in the program he had prepared more recently with a group of Harvard political scientists. Both plans set a course for the rapid adoption of a market economy, denationalization of state-owned enterprises and intensified cooperation with the West.
Mr. Gorbachev's surprise resignation as party chief came after Robert Strauss, the new American Ambassador to the Soviet Union, presented his credentials to the Soviet leader. He was received by Mr. Gorbachev in the Kremlin, where the two men had a chat. Mr. Strauss, who declined to say what he discussed with Mr. Gorbachev, is expected to return to the United States before formally taking up his position in September.
 The day's events followed on an unabating flood of consequences from the brief seizure of power by old-guard leaders in the Kremlin. In something of a prelude to Mr. Gorbachev's action, Mr. Yeltsin and other republic leaders continued their relentless move against the old order. Having already closed Pravda and other party newspapers, Mr. Yeltsin announced late Saturday that he was taking charge of all government communications on Russian territory, including telephones and "coded information," a phrase he did not explain.
 Earlier in the day, Mr. Yeltsin had ordered officials of the Russian republic to take custody of all K.G.B. and law-enforcement archives.
 That act would further undercut the effectiveness of the central government, since all Kremlin communciations would by involved.
 
Ukraine Declares Independence
 In the Ukraine, the parliament decided by an overwhelming vote of 321 to 2, with 6 abstentions, to declare independence, calling a referendum for Dec. 1 to give the measure its certain public support. Even before the referendum, the resolution declared only Ukrainian law valid on Ukrainian territory and the Ukraine sovereign over its resources, in effect stripping a republic of 50 million away from the Kremlin's control.
 At the same time, Mr. Yeltsin recognized the independence proclaimed by Estonia and Latvia, as he had before with Lithuania.

HEADLINE: Health Insurers, in Trying to Save, Find New Costs in Managing Care

BYLINE: By GLENN KRAMON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARSIPPANY, N.J.

 BODY:
Eager to slow runaway medical expenses, the nation's health insurers are competing to offer services that press doctors for discounts and, to the distress of some physicians and patients, freely second-guess medical decisions.
But a look at this rapidly spreading approach, known as managed care, makes clear that saving money costs money. And critics say the cost of saving money is too high. 
 Many health economists consider managed care the nation's most realistic chance for containing medical expenses and insuring high-quality care. So do a great many employers, which buy much of the health insurance and ultimately pay many of the bills.
 
'Best Answer' Challenged
 The health insurance industry, which once paid medical bills almost unquestioningly, hopes the more aggressive role in which it is recasting itself -- through operations like that of Prudential Insurance here -- will help stave off calls for a Government-run insurance system like Canada's. Such a system could put the industry out of business or reduce its role.
"Managed care is the best answer we know of today both in restraining cost increases and improving the quality of service and of clinical care," said Samuel H. Havens, a senior vice president at Prudential, the nation's largest commercial health insurer.
But critics contend that a hodgepodge of competing insurers can never be fully efficient at controlling costs. They also say that managed care adds a new administrative layer to the already complex health-insurance system, creating many jobs that did not exist a decade ago and costing billions of dollars a year more than it should.
"Reducing our administrative costs to the levels of Canada would save enough money not only to cover all the uninsured but to improve coverage of everyone else by reducing or eliminating out-of-pocket payments," said Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, an assistant professor at the Harvard Medical School. She co-wrote a report on administrative costs in the two countries that appeared in the May 2 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.
 
Fears of Big Brother
 To hear some American doctors tell it, Big Brother is alive and well and working in the insurance business. They contend that the managed-care system not only interferes with their medical judgments, sometimes with disastrous consequences, but that it also limits their patients' freedom to choose their doctors.
A typical day at Prudential's managed-care operation offered a glimpse of such an approach. In one case at the spacious new buildings housing the company's northern New Jersey division, a medical director concluded that a proposed breast reduction was not medically necessary and that the patient would have to pay the whole bill.
In another case, a Prudential nurse telephoned a doctor to suggest that he perform a gynecological operation at a surgery center in Prudential's medical network rather than the hospital proposed for it, where a smaller portion of the bill would be covered.
Staff members were out signing up a pediatric neurologist and an orthopedic surgeon for Prudential's network; doctors must agree in writing to offer discounts on their regular prices and cooperate with Prudential's reviewers. Meanwhile, marketing people were looking for more companies willing to enroll their employees in the network.
 
Millions Are Affected
 Managed care already embraces tens of millions of Americans. And with Congress considering how to rescue a health-care system in crisis, managed- care operations would play a central role in many prominent proposals for change, which involve extending and supplementing private insurance.
The heart of this strategy is organizing networks of doctors, hospitals, laboratories, pharmacies and other medical providers. The idea is to contain costs by not only securing a better price -- typically from 10 to 30 percent off the regular charge of a doctor or hospital -- but also deterring treatment the insurer deems inappropriate.
In some managed-care programs, patients are covered only if they are treated by doctors and hospitals in the network. Others allow a patient to go outside the network but then pay a lower share of the bill.
This is strong medicine for doctors and patients accustomed to unquestioned independence.
 
Doctors' Resistance Weakening
 But doctors' resistance is weakening as more networks are organized and more employers sign up their workers. Some of the networks are classic health maintenance organizations, which receive a prearranged monthly fee for each employee enrolled and either employ doctors or contract with them for full-time service. Others, known as independent practice associations, preferred provider organizations and network models, sign up doctors who also accept patients from other sources.
Along with Prudential, insurance giants, including Metropolitan Life Insurance, Cigna, Aetna Life and Casualty and Travelers, as well as some smaller commercial carriers, are introducing networks of various kinds and advertising them in a big way. So are some nonprofit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.
Insurers are not the only ones getting into the act. Humana Inc., the big health-care company, has organized networks in 24 states and is expanding to other areas. U.S. Healthcare Inc., a publicly traded company, is building a network in the Northeast. Many other networks -- some set up by doctors or hospitals, some by large corporations -- have also been organized.
 
Formidable Competition
 All of these groups face formidable competition from long-established health maintenance organizations. The largest, Kaiser Permanente, has more than five million members on the West Coast and is expanding eastward.
Many insurance experts argue that such competition will be good for Americans. "Competition between relatively large, competent, efficiency- minded systems like Kaiser and Prudential leads to innovations and improvements you don't get when the government takes over," said Alain C. Enthoven, a professor of management at the Stanford Business School.
A number of employers large and small report that programs like Prudential's have already cut the growth in their medical costs somewhat -- typically from increases of 20 percent a year to increases of 10 or 15 percent, or less for huge employers like the Southwestern Bell Corporation and the Marriott Corporation.
 
Administration Costs
 But the savings do not come cheaply. Managed-care networks typically raise administrative costs by an amount equal to about 5 percent of the employer's medical bill. And it is far from certain that in the long run the private insurers' competing armies will hold down costs enough to satisfy clients.
Indeed, some critics prefer a system like Canada's, where provincial governments pay medical bills for everyone, using federal and provincial tax dollars. These critics say Canada's system is simpler and less expensive to run and can exert more leverage over what doctors and hospitals are paid. Dr. Woolhandler of Harvard cited a General Accounting Office report issued in June that concluded that a shift to a Canadian-style system would save up to $67 billion on insurance overhead and hospital and physician administrative costs.
 
Canada's Cost Advantage
 All told, she estimates, administration amounts to about 24 percent of total health-care spending in the United States -- or more than $175 billion this year -- versus about 11 percent in Canada, based on data for 1987.
While aspects of managed care, like scrutiny of medical decisions, might still exist in a national insurance system, the existence of many private insurers creates inefficiencies that could be eliminated by a single national program, Dr. Woolhandler asserted. For one thing, each United States insurer must set up its own claims-processing center in a region, and each must devote a lot of time to determining who is eligible for what coverage. Competing insurers also spend a lot on marketing.
Managed care pursued by so many different insurers means extra paperwork for doctors and hospitals as well.
 
Concerns of the A.M.A.
 "Managed care can be a help or a hassle, but most of the time it's a hassle," said Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president at the American Medical Association.
Surveys of employees using the managed-care networks have shown that the vast majority are satisfied, although some complain because they want a doctor who is not in the network or because they must keep changing physicians as doctors join and leave the network. In a few instances, medical reviewers' interference -- like recommending that a patient leave the hospital before the doctor thinks he is ready -- has had tragic results.
 
Managed-Care Bureaucracy
 To look at the Prudential health-care system is to see a program that must spend more to save more. Nationwide, Prudential's network covers about a million people (including some employees of The New York Times).
The managed-care and claims-processing operation based in Parsippany, which handles the 110,000 people Prudential covers in northern New Jersey, alone employs about 200 people, many of whom would not be needed in a national health system. And this group does not include the support staff at the company, the middlemen between the insurer and the employer, or the extra people hired by doctors, hospitals and employers to handle their paperwork.
Even ignoring the administrative costs of managed care, the American system has trouble holding down costs because no insurer by itself has the power to bargain down prices significantly, said Henry J. Aaron, director of the Economic Studies Program at the Brookings Institution.
In the system Mr. Aaron proposes, the Government alone would negotiate physician fees and hospital budgets.
 
Prediction by Insurers
 Private insurers concede that their system of competing managed-care networks may not hold down prices the way the Government could, and can entail higher administrative costs. But Mr. Havens of Prudential predicted that as managed-care programs become more trusted and sophisticated, they will begin to save more, benefiting patients through reviews of their cases. Also, employers will increasingly tell their insurers to pay nothing on bills incurred outside the network, he predicted, which will lower administrative costs, though it may leave many patients less happy.
And they will tell the insurers more and more to limit the network to the physicians who agree to provide treatment for a fixed monthly amount, as opposed to a fee for each procedure completed. That would lower costs and further reduce paperwork.
What is more, as competition among insurers forces some out of the market, the survivors will have more customers and therefore more leverage in negotiating with doctors and hospitals.

Chart: "Spending in the Name of Saving"
 
In an effort to contain medical costs and improve quality, insurers have set up managed-care programs that are more complex and sometimes more expensive than previous claims-processing operations. Here is a look at the workings of Prudential's operation in Parsippany, which covers 110,000 members in northern New Jersey.
 
Eight representatives recruit physcians, hospitials and other providers for Prudential's network on the basis of credentials, convenience to members and willingness to accept the insurer's price and be reviewed by its staff.
 
Fifteen salespeople sell the networks to employers - directly, through brokers and agents to whom Prudential pays a commission, or through consultants hired by the employer.
 
Twenty-seven representatives staff the phone banks to answer questions and complaints about the networks from patients.
 
Eighteen nurses review treatments proposed by physicians, comparing them with medical protocol to determine appropriateness. An important part of the work is the review of care in catastrophic cases - like patietns with cancer, AIDS, disability from a stroke or an extremely premature baby.
 
One full-time medical director reviews questionable cases referred by the nurses for a final recommendation on whether the insurer will pay for the treatment. The patient or doctor may appeal a ruling.
 
Four part-time medical directors on contract help screen the credentials of physicians being considered for the network, evaluate to determine whether they were handled properly and consult with doctors in the network.
 
About 100 people examine and type claims into a computer, referring questionable ones to the medical staff. (pg. 28)

Urban Planners Glimpse Future on Rural Campus

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MORGANTOWN, W.Va.

 BODY:
While outsiders might think of the coal train as this state's contribution to the transportation arts, a visit to West Virginia University brings a surprise.
Snaking around the sprawling campus is a state-of-the-art people mover, a 3.3-mile stretch of electric cars run by computers that nearly 20 years after its groundbreaking continues to draw oohs and aahs and would-be imitators from around the world. 
 Next week, a delegation of Japanese land planners will join a very long list of transportation pilgrims who have come to this seldom-celebrated campus hoping to glimpse their own future.
For students of transportation engineering, the lessons the system offers have to do with things like "off-line capability." But for students of America, its lessons include a simpler one: the country's continuing ability to resist regional stereotype and produce surprises.
"People who come in from outside aren't so much overwhelmed at the technology of the thing; they're just surprised to find it here," said Greg Moore, 21 years old, the managing editor of the campus newspaper, The Daily Athenaeum.
The roots of the system date from the late 1960's when the imagination of a professor met up with the needs of politicians. Captivated by advances in computer technology, Prof. Samy Elias began to wonder whether a computer could drive a whole transportation system, eliminating the need for drivers.
At the time, even automated elevators were still a novelty in some parts of the country. Unsure whether the public would dare ride cars that travel 30 miles an hour without drivers, Professor Elias conducted public opinion surveys as well as feasibility studies on technology and cost.
At the same time, the Department of Transportation was in its idealistic youth and top officials were aghast at the problems of automobile congestion. They had great hopes for a technological breakthrough that could revolutionize mass transit.
Add in the fact that the late local Congressman, Harley O. Staggers Sr., was the chairman of the House transportation committee, and a Federal project was born. The Federal Government paid for 80 percent of the $138 million system and the Boeing Corporation built it.
Rushing for a dedication before the 1972 election, President Richard M. Nixon sent his daughter, Tricia, to a ribbon-cutting ceremony in late October, where one of the cars on the the not-quite-ready-for-prime-time system broke down.
Since then it has carried 35 million passengers more than 12 million miles, with no accidents and scarcely a graffito. And it grows cheaper to run with age. It cost $2.5 million to run in 1980 and the same 10 years later, despite inflation.
Personal Rapid Transit, or PRT, as it is known, was the world's first mass transit system driven entirely by computers, said Professor Elias, who now teaches at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. About 40 others have followed, including those in various airports and in downtown Miami and Detroit.
But the West Virginia system is still the only one in the world that offers nonstop service, Professor Elias said. That is, if you are at the Morgantown equivalent of 96th Street, heading for Times Square, push a button and within five minutes an electric-powered car arrives to take you there directly, with no intermediate stops.
Cars are dispatched only after a waiting passenger pushes a button.
There are five stations, and the cars, which can seat 8 and hold up to 13 others, run on wheels, not rails, along an elevated track. System engineers say the average wait for a car is 3.5 minutes. Operators in a control room monitor 27 safety features on each car and if one seems in danger -- say by traveling too fast -- the system automatically shuts down.
Much celebrated, the system has been imitated less often than its designers hoped. Professor Elias argues that the Federal Government ran out of money to subsidize construction. But others say plans for similar systems have also been thwarted by a lack of demand as Americans remain reluctant to abandon their cars.
The cars have made their way into campus lore. There was the time someone saw a man aboard in a ski mask, waving a gun. Control room engineers re-routed the car to a maintenance depot, where security guards rushed in with drawn guns, only to find a startled young dramatist on his way home from a school play.
There were a rash of fire extinguisher thefts, and a young man once threatened to kiss a woman passenger, but did not. This is what passes for crime in West Virginia.
Students, who pay $45 for semester-long passes, find the PRT useful not only for getting places but for offering alibis when they don't. "It's usually on time, but if you're late for class it's, 'The PRT was late,' " said Julie Trevana, 21, a senior.
Not long ago, the little cars were winning over new admirers, as clusters of parents were getting their first rides.
"I think it's a fantastic idea," said Rich Good, whose daughter is entering the university this year. He praised the cars' security and convenience, and their beautiful view of the coal barges working the Monongahela River.
Then he explained what, for a parent, may be the system's greatest appeal. "It eliminates the need for cars," he said.

HEADLINE: In Utah, Prosperity Is Making Room for Diversity

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY

 BODY:
In recent years, Utah has become a darling of corporate employers, who cherish its labor pool: young, well-educated, non-union and reared with the hard-work ethos of the pervasive Mormon faith.
But a funny thing has happened on the way to the economic boom here. As newcomers have discovered life at the foot of the Wasatch Range and decided to stay, the region has become much more diverse. 
 The state's capital, long regarded as an insular, homogenous community that tended to view change with suspicion, today is marked by profound change, as the city's identity, and its skyline, take a bolder new shape. Utah remains one of the most Republican and conservative states, but many say alternative viewpoints are getting a better hearing politically and culturally these days.
 
'Remarkable Change'
 "We've seen remarkable change here in the last 20 years," said Mayor Palmer DePaulis, an Italian-American Catholic and a Democrat, who is expected to run for governor next year.
"We're not quite Greenwich Village, but we've gone from a small-town mentality to a much more cosmopolitan community with a far greater global perspective."
Mormons once accounted for more than 70 percent of the population of Salt Lake County, but they now make up less than half. The balance includes significant Irish Catholic and Greek Orthodox populations.
For the first time in its 141-year history, the University of Utah has named a non-Mormon, Arthur Smith, to lead it.
Deedee Corradini has begun a campaign to become the city's first female mayor. She is not a Mormon and neither are two of the other three candidates.
And since last year, people in Utah can buy liquor by the drink.
To be sure, Utah has hardly lost its conservative bearings. The state Legislature in January passed one of the nation's most restrictive abortion laws. But last week Utah officials ordered a stay on the measure, choosing to wait and see how a similarly restrictive measure in Louisiana fares in the courts.
The state also has a right-to-work law, which narrowly limits unionization. The average wage, $10.70 an hour, is second only to New Mexico's average wage, of $9.30, as the lowest in the West.
And Utah's spending for education ranks toward the bottom among states, even though the adult literacy level, at 94 percent, is among the highest in the nation.
 
Economic Rebound
 In the first half of the 1980's, after the energy boom of the previous decade, Utah's economy went bust, as the oil, gas and coal industries slumped. But in the last four years, the economy has rebounded, with big gains in the service sector, principally in telecommunications. Utah is now home to 180 computer software companies, including a leader in the field, the Wordperfect Corporation, which designs and manufactures personal computer programs near Provo.
While the nation's economy has shrunk in the current recession, job growth in Utah has averaged about 4 percent in the last two years.
Since 1980, Utah's population has grown nearly 18 percent, to 1.7 million, a result of an influx of newcomers and the high birth rate among Mormons.
With plentiful workers, the state has been able to recruit large corporate employers, including Delta Air Lines, which established a western hub in Salt Lake City, and Sears' Discover Card unit, which has an operations center here.
Some financial magazines have lauded Utah as among the nation's most attractive places for employers, pointing to its moderate personal and corporate tax rates and pro-business climate. In such ratings, note also is taken of the hard-work ethic of the state's large, young labor pool (Utah's median age of 25.7 years is the youngest in the nation). In 1990, Fortune magazine ranked Salt Lake City as the best spot in the nation for companies to locate.
In today's global economy, one of Utah's biggest assets is the high number of people here who speak a foreign language. It helped to persuade American Express to base a travelers' check service center here, where calls are handled in 36 languages.
The high level of literacy in foreign languages stems largely from the Mormon practice of sending young people as missionaries around the world. Diane Calder, for example, spent two years proselytizing in Chile and returned with a fluency in Spanish. Her language skills landed her a job with American Express.
"Since I lived in rural Chile, I learned the everyday language that people speak," said Ms. Calder, a 28-year-old native of Salt Lake City, who works with Spanish-speaking customers. "It's not the textbook style, so people feel more comfortable when we talk."
Such Mormon missionaries have returned here with a worldly perspective that seems to have helped to enrich and broaden the city. For Ms. Calder and her friends, who have lived in Japan, Sweden and South Korea, among other places, conversations routinely get around to foreign affairs. In addition, a significant number of Mormons from other countries, especially in Asia, have moved here in recent years.
"Mormons and non-Mormons, or gentiles, as they call us, have co-existed here for a lot of years," said Mickey Gallivan, an Irish-Catholic and a fifth-generation Utahan. "But today there seems to be a greater acceptance in Salt Lake City, and of each other. When I was a kid, the first thing a lot of us wanted to do when we grew up, was to leave. I don't see that now."
Mr. Gallivan, a publicist who worked on the Salt Lake City bid to be the host if the the 1998 Winter Olympics, said the effort helped to foster greater unity in the city. Its bid lost narrowly to Nagano, Japan, but Salt Lake City will be the American nominee for the 2002 games.
"It's a different Salt Lake City than I moved to nine years ago," said Forrest Collins, the general manager of the Green Street Social Club, a bar, who moved here from San Francisco. "A lot of people are discovering Utah."
At the city's recent jazz and blues festival, the pulsating, bare-wire rhythms electrified a packed crowd of Salt Lakers. Many of the revelers were dancing in the aisles.
Kathleen Sullivan, a Harvard Law professor, had traveled to Utah for a seminar on justice and liberty. But she also took in the blues festival, and she said she sensed the quickening beat of this desert city.
"Hardly the image of tight-lipped Puritanism," she said.

HEADLINE: The New Revolution;
The West Must Be Quick on Its Feet

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN the last five years, the United States has had to refashion the central tenets of its foreign policy as the cold war came to an end and a new kind of Soviet Union began to evolve. But until last week, that formidable task was eased by one constant element in the rapidly changing equation -- the unitary if frequently troubled leadership of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
The tumult of the last six days has ended Mr. Gorbachev's primacy and with it, apparently, a thousand-year tradition of concentrating absolute power in one man or woman. For policy makers in Washington and other Western capitals, the problem now is how to deal with yet another radically different Soviet Union, one whose very shape, whose policies and principles are unclear, but whose complexity is assured by the success of the Russian people for the first time in substituting the popular will for the tyranny of czar and dictator. 
 Mikhail Gorbachev opened Soviet society, closed by terror for decades, to intellectual free trade, but he stumbled over the next steps in transforming his nation -- the creation of a true multiparty society and the establishment of a market economy. A major question is whether George Bush, who has shown a sure-footed skill in managing United States relations with Mr. Gorbachev, will do as well in the testing time to come.
At meetings in London and in Maine this week, the West will start exploring a new policy on aid, on relations with the fractious republics, on the new leadership itself.
 
Blame for Gorbachev
 A sharp shift in emphasis is already clear in Europe, however, especially in Germany. Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, an early Gorbachev champion, predicted that the Baltic republics would soon win freedom, regardless of Mr. Gorbachev's position. And Otto Lambsdorf, another influential foreign-policy leader, blamed Mr. Gorbachev for "great failures" in not moving quickly enough on economic reform.
The change is likely to renew the debate that Mr. Bush, in alliance with the Japanese and Canadian leaders, won at the July economic summit conference in London, warding off quick, large-scale direct financial aid to Moscow. While Mr. Bush continues to favor waiting for evidence of comprehensive reform, some of his European partners do not. Jurgen Mollemann, the German economics minister, said it was urgent for the West "to give the Soviet Union more and faster help," and President Francois Mitterrand of France agreed, commenting that "now we have to make a much bigger effort than we have made so far."
Even Prime Minister John Major of Great Britain has begun to edge toward the Franco-German stance. As the current chairman of the Group of Seven industrialized nations, he summoned senior officials of the summit nations to a meeting in London this week to ponder possible changes in the group's positions. He urged that the Soviets be given "not just cash but assistance on how to do things, how to establish private enterprises, how to set up a stock exhange, how to operate a market."
Mr. Major is to meet Mr. Bush this week in Maine, where they will no doubt discuss a common position.
Over time, the collapse of the coup should accelerate trends in the Soviet Union that the United States wishes to encourage. The Old Guard is gone if not forgotten. The military, most of whose leaders chose the wrong side, will be in no position to demand as large a share of scarce financial resources, to try to subvert or delay arms control agreements or to lobby for continuing support for Afghan Communists. The K.G.B.'s capacity for mischief has been reduced if not eliminated.
Beyond that, economic reform in the Soviet Union will almost certainly accelerate rapidly, rendering moot as it does the debate over when the West should make a major financial move. But in the interim Mr. Bush is likely to find himself under pressure..
 
A Way to Participate
 "I think it's wrong to wait any longer," said Robert Hunter of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who was a key foreign-policy adviser in the Carter White House. "I'd like to see a democracy fund of say, $10 billion. Use it for grain credits or whatever, but let's get out in front and show we want to be a participant, not just an onlooker, and help those brave people."
Economists argue that much of the money would be wasted if it was committed too soon. But a major financial commitment by the United States, along with the Western allies, could be as much a political as an economic act, a carefully calculated attempt to keep the winds of history blowing and the tides of change flowing democracy's way.
George F. Kennan, the diplomat and scholar who conceived the American policy of containment in response to Soviet expansionism after World War II, described last week's coup and countercoup as "a turning point of the most momentous historical significance," exceeding in import even the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. In dealing with its consequences, he said on the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour on public television, the United States would do well to remember an admonitory comment by John Quincy Adams and not overreach.
"She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all," Adams said of the United States on July 4, 1821. "She is the champion and vindicator only of her own."
Mr. Bush is proceeding in his characteristically cautious way. His favored word, used again last week, is "prudent." He refused to jump to the conclusion that the coup could not be reversed, he insisted that it was up to the Soviets, and not to him, to "sort it out" in terms of new cabinet members and other officials and he would not be drawn into comparing the relative strengths of Mr. Gorbachev and Boris N. Yeltsin, the hero of the resistance against the neo-Stalinist junta.
But such restraint cannot last forever. Decisions will have to be made. It matters enormously to the United States and its allies, to cite just one question among many, who ends up with the keys to the nuclear weapons once the seemingly inevitable breakup of the Soviet empire has been completed.
The most immediate problem for the Western leaders is managing the relationship with Mr. Gorbachev and simultaneously, perhaps more important, dealing with with Mr. Yeltsin, who has emerged as something more than President of the Russian federated republic if not yet as the leader of the Soviet Union.
It would be simplistic to suggest that it is time to choose up sides; both men have roles, at least for now, and both have strengths. But if it was ever possible for Mr. Bush to deal comfortably with Mr. Yeltsin in a decidedly secondary level, it is possible no more; as the political analyst William Schneider pointed out, Mr. Gorbachev now derives his political legitimacy from Mr. Yeltsin, not vice versa.
Indeed, on Friday, Mr. Gorbachev seemed to defer to Mr. Yeltsin as he accepted without cavil the decrees of the Russian leader and the actions, some of them of dubious legality, of Yeltsin allies on the Moscow City Council. And it was Mr. Yeltsin, by all accounts, who forced the dismissal of members of the Soviet Government, some of whom Mr. Gorbachev would have preferred to keep.
Edmund Wilson called his history of the Russian revolution "To the Finland Station," after the terminal in Petrograd (now Leningrad) where Lenin arrived to take charge of the uprising. To pursue the metaphor, there seems a strong possibility that Mr. Gorbachev has missed the train of counterrevolution.
Mr. Yeltsin has been popularly elected, and in a landslide to boot; Mr. Gorbachev has never run for office. Mr. Yeltsin began moving to outlaw the Communist Party even as Mr. Gorbachev, its leader, clinged to the idea that the party could be a force for change. As it happened, Mr. Gorbachev was forced to change, resigning as chief of the party late yesterday. Mr. Yeltsin favors immediate independence for the Baltic states; Mr. Gorbachev resists. Mr. Yeltsin a free-market man; Mr. Gorbachev, not yet.
In other words, Mr. Yeltsin stands for the things most Americans stand for, so he is now President Bush's natural ally. So far, though, Mr. Bush has refrained from embracing the Russian's position on matters like the Baltics, straddling the issue by supporting independence but not demanding it now. The continuing fear within the Administration, especially in its more conservative circles, is that sudden freedom for the Baltic states might set off explosive demands in other republics, intensify nationalist animosities and lead to civil war or chaos.

HEADLINE: TAIWANESE TO END USE OF DRIFT NETS

BYLINE: By AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Taiwan has promised to comply with a United Nations ban on fishing with drift nets in the North Pacific Ocean, winning cautious praise from United States officials.
The Taiwanese Government, under threat of American trade sanctions, announced Friday that it would end the use of the nets, which stretch as far as 30 miles and snare all marine life in their path, beginning next July 1. 
 Representatives Jolene Unsoeld and John Miller, both from Washington State, said they welcomed the news, but expressed concern that Taiwan had broken past promises to halt the use of the nets.
"We need more than words," said Ms. Unsoeld, a Democrat. "Now is the time to step up the pressure, not breathe a sigh of relief."
 
Looking for Proof
 She said she was looking for "proof that Taiwan would stop destructive drift-netting, especially given its history of saying one thing on drift nets and then doing the exact opposite."
Albert Lin, a spokesman for Taiwan's Coordination Council for North American Affairs in Washington, said Taiwan had indicated in the past that it respected the spirit of the pending drift-net prohibitions but had not previously committed itself to the ban in international waters.
Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations. Mr. Lin is the information officer for the council that acts as an informal Taiwanese Embassy in Washington.
The Bush Administration put Taiwan and South Korea on notice last week that they may face trade sanctions because they continued to fish with the nets.
United States Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher attested to Taiwan's violations in a formal certification message to President Bush on Aug. 14, clearing the way for Mr. Bush to impose tariffs or an embargo on Taiwanese and South Korean seafood products.
 
Response to Threats Denied
 Mr. Lin said Friday's announcement was "not directly" tied to the threats of trade sanctions.
"In the past we said we respected the U.N. resolution in principle, but did not make the final decision," he said. "This is the first time we are making an official announcement."
Roddy Moscoso, a spokesman for the United States National Marine Fisheries Service, said Taiwan was the first drift-netting nation to publicly announce its intent to abide by the resolution.
"Certainly we are pleased," Mr. Moscoso said. But, he said, "this announcement does not change the status of the certification of the drift-net violations."
The United States Government has no statistics on Taiwanese and Korean drift nets. However, the marine fisheries service reported that in 1990, 10 percent of Japan's drift-net fleet killed 1,758 whales and dolphins, 253,288 tuna, 81,956 blue sharks, 30,464 sea birds and more than 3 million other noncommercial fish, including some salmon tagged from hatcheries in the Columbia River basin.
Japan has the world's largest drift-net fleet with about 450 vessels in the North Pacific. South Korea and Taiwan each have about 150 there.
Mr. Miller, a Republican, said he shared Ms. Unsoeld's concern that Taiwan may not follow through with its promise.
"But we should welcome the announcement," he said in a telephone interview from Seattle. "It is a positive step. It is going to increase the pressure on Korea and Japan."
"I think what this tells us is that when we threaten to take certain action like banning some of their imports into this country, that it does bring results," he said.

HEADLINE: The Region;
As Blacks Clash With Hasidic Jews In Crown Heights, Who's in Control?

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN

 BODY:
IN a crucial moment during an angry rally of blacks in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, last week, about 300 youths peeled off from the main march and ran to the headquarters of the Lubavitch Hasidic sect. In the face of a phalanx of riot-helmeted police officers, they slashed to tatters a homemade Israeli flag and hurled rocks and bottles at the police and the Hasidic Jews behind the phalanx.
At another moment, there were so few police officers in front of a school where the Mayor was meeting with neighborhood youths that they had to retreat through the gates and into the school when a mob approached, attacking television vans and flipping over police cars. 
 Mayor David N. Dinkins, New York City's first black mayor, was shouted down and his entourage pelted with rocks and bottles Wednesday when he pleaded for peace. Some Jewish youths roamed the neighborhood in cars with bats and guns, saying they were from the Jewish Defense Organization, not part of the Lubavitchers.
Black and Jewish religious leaders alike deplored the violence but the pleas fell on deaf ears.
Again and again last week, the question kept coming up: Who's in charge? And it seemed to apply to almost everyone: the marchers, the rioters, the Hasidim, the police, even to New York City itself.
The hate kept bubbling and by the end of the week there were two dead, scores arrested, dozens injured, extensive property damage and a stain on a community that has worked to keep up its fragile image as an oasis of racial tolerance. The only thing that seemed to stanch the violence by Thursday night was 2,000 riot police who turned the neighborhood into an armed camp.
Local residents and politicians said that young people frustrated by a long hot summer without money or jobs were easy game for "demagogues" and blamed those who have led other recent protest marches, the Rev. Al Sharpton, the Rev. Herbert Daughtry and Sonny Carson, who all spoke to black youths at Crown Heights rallies, but were not on hand when the violence flared. On Friday night, they met with city officials at a Bedford-Stuyvesant theater.
In an interview Thursday, Mayor Dinkins spoke of "a failure of leadership at the grass-roots level," blaming parents and other adults. On top of that, he said, irresponsible adult protesters had encouraged violence.
The shadowy leadership of the protests was akin to the forces that led the year-long boycott of a Korean grocer in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn over a confrontation with a Haitian customer. As in Crown Heights, demonstrators there refused to name their leaders and disdained white reporters.
The spark in Crown Heights was another clash between two cultures. On Monday night, a station wagon driven by a Hasidic man ran a red light, some witnesses said, bounced off another car and struck bystanders, killing 7-year-old Gavin Cato and injuring his cousin. In the confusion that followed, the occupants of the station wagon were beaten, and then a rumor flashed through the neighborhood that a Hasidic ambulance had left the children unattended to treat the Hasidic driver. In the nightlong violence that followed, a 29-year-old Hasidic Jew from Australia, Yankel Rosenbaum, was stabbed to death. Police are holding a black teen-ager in the killing.
The station wagon had been part of an escort for Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, the 89-year-old Grand Rabbi of the Lubavitch Hasidic sect, as he returned from prayers at a Queens cemetery. Rabbi Schneerson, in a 45-minute address in Yiddish to his followers on Tuesday night, did not directly mention the accident, the stabbing or the riot or suggest a response. But his followers insisted that this did not mean he lacked either leadership or sympathy for the dead child.
Rabbi Shmuel Butman, a spokesman for the Lubavitchers, said Rabbi Schneerson usually speaks allegorically, and had taken the text from last week's synagogue reading from Deuteronomy: "When you go out to war against your enemies . . ."
"The Rebbe brought out the idea that a Jew and a war are two separate worlds," Rabbi Butman said. "War is something we resort to in most unusual circumstances and as a very last resort." The message was one of restraint, he said, and was repeated in synagogues every night last week. "We have managed to restrain our community for the last four days," he said Friday, "and that has not been easy."
 
Coordinated Response
 In addition, he said, Jewish community leaders have met in an emergency council all week long to coordinate their response to the crisis.
Blacks said that they had no similar vehicle for leadership. Blacks in Crown Heights include many from Caribbean nations like Haiti, Guyana, Trinidad and Jamaica whose cultures and even languages differ from one another's and from those of American blacks. The young blacks who shouted "Heil Hitler" and threw rocks presumably don't belong to youth groups and are hard to reach.
Representative Major Owens, who represents the district, was hospitalized for heart surgery in Washington.
City officials, many of them black, tried different ways to go out in the neighborhood, with human rights officials buttonholing people on streetcorners and deputy mayors meeting in schools with selected student leaders or heads of block associations and tenant groups. "We've got to build bridges," said City Councilwoman Mary Pinkett, who represents portions of Crown Heights.
Colin Moore, an attorney who was a popular speaker at demonstrations, said black elected officials have not effectively addressed the tensions, which stem from poverty and unemployment, and include feelings that the Hasidim are richer, get preferential treatment in housing and from the police and are driving blacks out of the neighborhood. But with a black Mayor and police led by a black chief getting little respect from the crowd, it took a show of force to quiet things.
 
Awaiting the Messiah
 In contrast to the divisiveness among blacks, the Hasidic Jews have Yiddish and Hebrew as common tongues and devotion to Orthodox tradition as a unifying force. They also have a strong sense of hope. Followers of Rabbi Schneerson believe that they are on the verge of the Messianic era, and that recent world events -- the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, the failure of the coup in the Soviet Union, the swift allied victory in the Persian Gulf -- are all signs of a coming redemption.
Amid the violence this week, Lubavitch youngsters continued to wear T-shirts proclaiming: "Hold on! Moshiach (the Messiah) is coming!"
There should be much talk of hope in churches and synagogues this weekend. Whether the quiet will hold as the police are withdrawn may depend on the qualities of leadership that evolve from the crisis.

The Environmental Impact of President Bush

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN 1988, George Bush stood on the deck of a boat in Boston's filthy harbor and proclaimed himself an environmentalist. Throughout the campaign he promised to scrub the skies with a strengthened Clean Air Act, set a goal of "no net loss of wetlands" and do everything in his power to halt global environmental threats. "Those who think we're powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect," he declared in a speech in Michigan in August 1988, "are forgetting about the White House effect."
This month, prompted by Administration proposals to open millions of acres of wetlands to development and to officially lower the risk estimates for dioxin and other long-feared contaminants, Mr. Bush's record on the environment is undergoing more scrutiny than at any other time in his Presidency. 
 Environmentalists, to no one's surprise, attacked the wetlands and dioxin proposals and asserted that the President was backing away from pledges he made in the campaign. "He's talking the talk, but he's not walking the walk," said Representative Gerry Sikorski, a Minnesota Democrat who is an influential voice on environmental issues.
But industrialists say that the President appears capable of balancing business and environmental goals, and they are encouraged. "If you compare this Administration with the last three, there is no doubt the President has taken the point on environmental issues," said Gordon D. Strickland, a vice president of the Chemical Manufacturers Association in Washington.
An examination of the record suggests that Mr. Bush's environmental policies are neither as good as the White House says nor as bad as the environmental community contends.
The Administration, with its eye to the 1992 campaign, argues that Mr. Bush's record on the environment puts him in the first rank of conservation-minded Presidents. "In the last two-and-a-half years, George Bush has done more for the environment than virtually any of his predecessors," said Robert E. Grady, the associate director for natural resources, energy and science at the White House Office of Management and Budget.
At the top of the list of achievements credited to Mr. Bush is the new Clean Air Act enacted last year. The President broke a stalemate in Congress and helped to push through the most comprehensive environmental statute ever enacted, a law that sets out to reduce urban smog, cut acid rain, and control toxic chemicals in the atmosphere. But environmental groups say that in writing the Federal regulations mandated by the law, the Administration is blunting its effect.
For example, the Clean Air Act requires companies to get permits that set limits on the levels of pollutants they are allowed to emit. But a proposal offered by the White House would allow companies to exceed those limits automatically if states do not review requests for changes within seven days.
But environmentalists give the Administration credit for the move by E.P.A. Administrator William K. Reilly in 1989 to block the construction in Colorado of the Two Forks Dam, which would have destroyed a scenic canyon. And this month, the E.P.A. was praised for helping to reach an agreement to reduce haze in the Grand Canyon. Mr. Bush also set a 10-year moratorium on oil drilling off the coasts of New England, southern Florida and California. He authorized the Energy Department and the Pentagon to spend nearly $7 billion this year for cleaning up toxic chemicals and radioactive contamination from weapons manufacture. And he signed a treaty banning imports of ivory.
"Looking at the record, you see he cares," said Brooks B. Yeager, the Washington legislative director for the National Audubon Society. "You also get a sense that he could be much better than he is, that he could carve a niche for himself. But he seems paralyzed at times. In the large problem areas where taking action requires facing down the conservative elements of his constituency, he's been much more hesitant."
 
Planetary Problems
 In the national energy strategy made public in the Persian Gulf War, Mr. Bush called for increased production by opening the untouched Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil exploration while at the same time asking for very modest energy conservation measures.
In the debate over global climate change, which has put the United States at odds with most of its allies, the Administration has insisted that it is already doing more than other nations to reduce the threat. The White House says the Clean Air Act and an international treaty to phase out the use of chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals that destroy the earth's ozone shield, make the United States a leader in efforts to counteract global warming. Environmental scientists, however, say the United States is steadfastly resisting limiting its production of carbon dioxide, the principal cause of global warming, because of concerns about curtailing industrial expansion.
Then there is the wetlands policy announced earlier this month. After coming under heavy political pressure from developers, oil companies and other industries that contribute heavily to the Republican Party, the President proposed action that could reduce by tens of millions of acres the amount of low-lying bottomlands, marshes, swamps and other wetlands now protected from development.
The White House said the new policy would still safeguard more land than was protected before 1989, when the existing wetlands policy was put into effect. But the Environmental Defense Fund, a national group based in New York, said the proposal "would constitute probably the largest weakening of an environmental regulation in U.S. history."
The energy, global warming and wetlands policies largely reflect the attitudes of the President's closest conservative aides, say Administration officials: John H. Sununu, the chief of staff; Richard G. Darman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget; Michael J. Boskin, the head of the Council of Economic Advisors; and Roger P. Porter, the domestic policy adviser. Vice President Dan Quayle has also become an influential player in environmental issues as head of the White House Council on Competitiveness, which has emerged as an important voice for business interests.
More moderate members of the Administration, led by Mr. Reilly of the E.P.A., have challenged the conservative view on environmental issues, but by all accounts Mr. Bush has been satisfied to let the two sides battle without interfering. Against such stiff competition, Mr. Reilly is generally overwhelmed.
Administration officials say Mr. Sununu, Mr. Darman and Mr. Boskin are convinced that aggressive measures on the environment alienate the party's business constituency. Mr. Reilly and his supporters say such thinking is short-sighted. In case after case, factories that modernize pollution equipment find that they also become more efficient. Polls show that 75 to 85 percent of the public supports tough environmental regulation. In its quest to become the majority party, some officials say, the environment could play an important role for the Republicans, especially in attracting young voters.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE COUP;
Bush Low-Key on Soviet Moves and Aid Pressure

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 24

 BODY:
The White House offered a strikingly low-key response to the events in the Soviet Union today, as the Bush Administration tried to ward off pressure from Europe to consider increases in Soviet aid.
President Bush, who received briefings on the news from Moscow from his top aides while devoting much of the day to golfing and boating with his weekend guest, Arnold Palmer, shrugged off suggestions that the collapse of the Communist Party warranted major increases in aid. 
 He also said he felt under "no pressure" to agree to quick increases. But aides acknowledged that the pressure from Europe at least to address the issue was rising, and the White House announced that senior officials from the seven leading industrial democracies would meet in London on Friday to do just that.
After word came from Moscow of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's resignation as Communist Party General Secretary, yet another event that came faster than American officials had anticipated, the only reaction from the White House came in one sentence from a three-paragraph written statement from Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's spokesman.
 
'We're Not Blase About It'
 "We welcome this news as another step forward in the reform process," Mr. Fitzwater's statement said.
The language seemed tepid at a time when the United States is seeing the aim of four decades of foreign policy, the crumbling of Communist power in the Soviet Union, come to pass.
Mr. Bush has said repeatedly that events in Moscow are going well in terms of American interests. But Administration officials said the White House was making a deliberate attempt to avoid strong statements about the rapidly unfolding changes in the Soviet Union.
"We're not blase about it," an official said. "But I don't think you start commenting in any detail on massive internal changes in other countries. This is going to go on whether or not we put it in neon lights, and there will be time for celebration. What we've been trying to do ever since that committee locked up Gorbachev is to not make things worse. I think we did a pretty good job of that."
In part, these modest goals reflect a recognition by the Administration that there is little it can do to influence events in the Soviet Union at this point. But the Administration's cautious approach also served two other purposes.
 
Pressure to Increase Aid
 First, Mr. Bush has been trying to avoid taking sides between Mr. Gorbachev and Boris N. Yeltsin. Today, he sent his new Ambassador to Moscow, Robert S. Strauss, to present his credentials to Mr. Gorbachev. He had a one-hour meeting with the Soviet President. Then Mr. Strauss met with Mr. Yeltsin for 40 minutes.
Beyond that, Mr. Bush is trying to counter pressures to increase economic aid to the Soviet Union from other world leaders. While the United States went along with the plan to hold a senior-level meeting of the seven rich industrialized nations in London, Administration officials took pains to say today that they did not consider it to be preparatory to a meeting of the nations' leaders.
"We're not anxious to do that right now," an official said. "It's going to take us a little bit of time to absorb this and the Soviets a little time to absorb it. It's not that we're not anxious to help a process that's clearly going in our favor, but doing it a week after the coup is a little soon."
Today, while playing golf, Mr. Bush seemed intent on making clear that he did not think it was time to increase aid. Before learning of Mr. Gorbachev's resignation, he was asked if the removal of Communist control of the Soviet economy would make a difference to his position.
"What makes a difference to me on the aid question is the reforms and how they're going to go forward," he said.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Kohl Says He Was Right on Aid
BONN, Aug. 24 (Reuters) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl says the Soviet coup attempt showed that he was right in aiding Moscow.
In an interview on Friday night, Mr. Kohl urged his Western allies to follow Germany's example and lectured the West for not backing Soviet reform policies as much as he had wished.
"Now everyone must say what they are really doing," he said. "We, the Germans, have done more than everyone else, and we had good reasons to do it."

HEADLINE: After the Joy, Winter

 BODY:
Shock and fear dissolved with dazzling speed into triumph and joy last week. And now Mikhail Gorbachev has resigned as head of the Communist Party. The Soviet Union suddenly seems poised for monumental transformation, once faithless officials have been rooted out and Mr. Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin rebalance the scales of post-Communist power.
Amid all the relief and pride, it seems almost sullen to recall an enduring question. Still, within weeks, the joy of August will turn into Soviet winter and it is a question that people in the West are obliged to ask: 
 Do the Soviet Union's leaders now have the courage to carry out their new mandate for radical economic reform? And to ask the question is to recognize the West's responsibility. It is not to provide charity but to promote the birth, and ease the birth pains, of a market economy.
The way to do that is to offer a specific program of transitional support -- to be delivered only as Moscow carries out specific economic changes.
Even with the hard-liners silenced, many obstacles remain. In the wake of obtuse centralized planning, the economy is crumbling. Echelons of bureaucrats still run day-to-day affairs; they can sabotage reform. And no leader, not even Mr. Yeltsin or an unencumbered Mr. Gorbachev, wants to confront the anger of workers who have never known unemployment, or consumers anguished by no goods and lost savings.
Yet until the Soviet Union moves credibly and dependably toward a market system, the words "radical reform" will remain empty. By spelling out a generous program of transition assistance, linked to specific Soviet reforms, the West could give a useful push to the internal debate.
The seven leading industrial nations plan to meet later this week on how most usefully to help. It would be an ideal time to take seriously some version of the Grand Bargain proposed by U.S. and Soviet analysts last spring. Yesterday, Mr. Gorbachev reportedly detailed to U.S. Ambassador Robert Strauss his plans for accelerated economic reforms and asked for coordinated Western help.
The Soviet side of such a bargain would have to embrace three big principles:
Stop Printing Rubles: By pouring billions of rubles into the economy, Moscow is fueling rampant inflation, which it must then control with price controls. Under these circumstances, market-based prices are impossible.
The solution is economically simple but politically hazardous: Plug the Government's huge deficit. That would require massive cutbacks in defense, which accounts for 30 percent of the Soviet economy, gargantuan even by U.S. standards. It would also mean an end to subsidizing inefficient enterprises. When these close, tens of millions would, at least temporarily, lose their jobs.
Set Prices Free: Managers need market-based signals that reflect economic scarcity, not political whim. Only then can they decide which goods are worth producing. Price reform need not be complete but must be sweeping. The Soviets cannot simply jack up prices by fiat: the goal is free, not necessarily higher, prices.
Privatize Stores and Factories: The bureaucratic stranglehold over economic decisions must be broken. The best way is to turn over businesses to individual citizens, even foreigners. Privatization need not be complete but must be widespread.
If Soviet leaders undertook these fundamental reforms, what could the West do to allay the attendant political pain and risk? The most important principle is that the program of assistance be made specific. Vague promises prod no progress.
By one reckoning, a sensible program would provide about $25 billion a year for several years. Washington's share would come to only $3 billion a year. The total would be enough to provide:
Currency Stabilization. A $10 billion fund would support the value of the ruble and facilitate trade.
Balance-of-Payments Relief. This might start at $15 billion or $20 billion the first year and taper down to zero. This would make it possible to sustain food and other vital imports in the early phases.
Support for Long-Term Investments. Attracting investment will require rebuilding infrastructure, repairing food distribution links and upgrading transportation facilities.
These elements constitute a bargain that would bring economic opportunity and political stability to the Soviet people and growing trade and security for the world. That's a bargain indeed.

HEADLINE: In the Nation;
Damned Either Way

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER; Leslie H. Gelb is on vacation.

 BODY:
The staggering news from Moscow momentarily obscured events that ordinarily might have occupied Americans' attention, such as the new questions raised about the integrity of financial markets by the Salomon Brothers scandal; the withdrawal of another potential Democratic Presidential candidate, Albert Gore, and the battle developing over President Bush's nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.
But the latest Wall Street disclosure only underscores again the sleazy grab-it-while-you-can economic atmosphere of the 80's, which is now coming into full view. And Democrats, sooner or later, will field a Presidential candidate, weak or strong, and contest the 1992 election, well or poorly. 
 The Thomas nomination has larger implications -- and not merely that his confirmation apparently would strengthen the already existing conservative majority on the Court, or that his and other justices' comparative youth would sustain that majority far into the 21st century. The impending confirmation battle in the Senate could have lasting repercussions on the Democratic Party and on the racial issues central to national politics.
Something like the coalition that defeated Robert Bork has emerged to fight Clarence Thomas, including a number of black organizations; the National Women's Law Center has just joined the lengthening list, primarily in fear of his perceived antagonism to abortion rights. But it's doubtful that even so formidable an opposition can prevail in the Thomas case.
It's hard, for one important thing, for white senators to vote against a black nominee for Thurgood Marshall's seat -- the so-called "black seat" on the Court. Many blacks support Judge Thomas, in spite of his stated views, as one who has shared much of their particular experience. Having risen from poverty in the segregated South, he is even regarded by some blacks -- and touted by many whites -- as a "role model." If he is defeated, a black "backlash" is possible, particularly if, as is widely expected, Mr. Bush then turned to a white conservative nominee.
The single most cited reason for opposition to Judge Thomas is his critical view of affirmative action programs, which the Bush Administration has been busily branding as "quotas" and indicting the Democratic party for supporting. If Judge Thomas loses in a Senate with a Democratic majority, it will be largely on this ground, and would give Mr. Bush a new store of ammunition for his anti-quota campaign in 1992.
The rejection of Clarence Thomas, a black opponent of quotas, by a Democratic Senate could hurt the Democrats in several ways. It could shake their vital black political support, enough to change election outcomes in some constituencies. It would add plausibility and effectiveness to Mr. Bush's expected campaign against "quotas" and the disadvantages they supposedly impose upon white workers.
Thus, ironically enough, though Judge Thomas is black, his defeat, and the President's ensuing campaign, would further identify the Democrats as a party primarily concerned about blacks and minorities -- an identification already so strong as to be probably the major political liability Democrats take into national campaigns.
Even if the struggle is considered solely in terms of the Senate, Judge Thomas is a more difficult target than Judge Bork. The latter was defeated not least by the nearly universal opposition of blacks; with their new-found political strength in Southern states, they were able to influence white Southern senators to oppose a man these senators ordinarily would have supported. Southern conservative votes -- for instance, Howell Heflin of Alabama -- doomed that nomination.
No such black unanimity is evident in opposition to Clarence Thomas. For that reason, and because he is from Georgia and viewed as a self-made "role model," it will not be easy to swing Southern senators, or other conservative Democrats, against him. Given the nearly unanimous Republican support Mr. Bush probably can evoke, a relatively narrow confirmation vote is likely.
Even that could hurt the Democrats, if they are perceived to line up largely against Judge Thomas -- particularly if that becomes their party line. They might well be damned if they do defeat him, and damned if they don't, as the party that opposed a role-model, black, conservative opponent of quotas. Either way, George Bush wins.

HEADLINE: Don't Pronounce the Democrats Dead Just Yet;
Iowa's Earlier Populist

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Aug. 5 front-page article on Senator Tom Harkin's testing of the waters for a Presidential campaign quotes both sides of the political aisle in measuring him up as a George McGovern with hair and a man with "a Hubert Humphrey-type message that speaks to people's needs." You also note Mr. Harkin's own words in New Hampshire about populism. Probably the last great progressive American populist who thought and spoke like Mr. Harkin was another Iowan, Henry A. Wallace, who served four years as Secretary of Agriculture and two terms as Vice President under Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
 Memories of Wallace may be dim. But his call for the Age of the Common Man, when others sought the Age of America (only), come back to us 43 years after Wallace founded the Progressive Party of 1948 and was red-baited for his liberal ideas -- which seemed to serve us well during his eight-year Vice Presidency. Now others are calling for another elitist Age of America, even as homeless families suffer in our cities and unemployment benefits run out for possibly hundreds of thousands of unemployed workers.
If Senator Harkin's populism is based on liberal values, plain and unadulterated, isn't it conceivable that, like Henry Wallace and the Progressive Party, Mr. Harkin will enjoy massive loyal support from blue-collar Democrats and other common people?

Brickbats and Cap'n Billy's Whiz Bang

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
THE brickbats, leavened by an occasional plaudit, continue to drizzle in. Here, edited for brevity, is a smattering from the mailbag:
Dear Etc., 
 As a non-car owner living in Manhattan, your column serves to remind one that this is, after all, a great car culture we are living in.
Now for specifics. Your mentions of the '91 Chevy Caprice and your column on the Caprice as a New York cab were interesting, since other than renting cars occasionally, car travel for me is a taxicab.
Indeed, growing up in a non-car family in my native London, the first vehicle that I owned was a 1956 Austin London Metropolitan FX3 taxicab, then 10 years old. This was probably the definitive taxi, designed for that purpose, which brings me to your love affair with the Chevy Caprice variation.
My first ride in this vehicle was with my wife and 6-year-old daughter, and we had as much legroom -- or less -- than if we were in the back of an MGB hardtop. Why? Because the cab was fitted with a roof-to-floor partition by its owner. In this city, which is dangerous for cab drivers, why is a custom vehicle not complete with a designed partition as were the Austins?
It was probably fun to do your test drive of the Caprice taxi, but did you travel as a passenger in one?
 
Brian Berke
New York
I agree that the Caprice is no London cab. It is also way short of being a Checker, the old favorite of New Yorkers. And, yes, I did ride in back. My wife was driving and trying to run up the meter. She got no tip. M. S.
 
What Relevance C.S.I.?
 In your article concerning the Lexus Coupe, you have the scores for several cars in the Customer Satisfaction Index, and my question is simple. What is the statistical significance of Power's C.S.I.? Is this index a month after buying a car, six months after purchase? And was there ever a follow-up to make this statistically significant for your readers?
 
Charles A. Monnin Jr.
Miami
J. D. Power and Associates is a consulting firm known best for its work with the automobile industry. Its Customer Satisfaction Index, advertised widely every year by the winners, is based on a poll of more than 100,000 buyers of cars and light trucks. The survey rates their satisfaction with the vehicles and their experiences at the dealership after 12 to 14 months of ownership. A full discussion of the company and its surveys appeared in this column on July 8, 1990. M. S.
 
Eye of the Beholder
 Please do not offer a comparison of the Lexus SC400 vs. a Mercedes 500SL, a BMW 850, or the incredible Acura NSX. These are all gorgeous automobiles. The SC is an unattractive lump and is priced accordingly. The car has no style!

Mad at the Messenger . . .
 One of my pleasures in retirement is to pick up The Times outside my door. However, that mood quickly changed when I read your piece on the Lexus Coupe.
Isn't it enough that 120,000 American workers have lost their jobs due to the Japanese invading the car industry? Isn't it enough that our "friends" from Tokyo have bought out so much of this country, while not letting our businesses be there?
People buy cars when the car magazines give them a good review. They also buy cars when the reviewer of the prestigious New York Times gives a good review. As if that were not enough, you had to list the quality survey that shows the Japanese on top again.
At age 72, I don't own a car now. I sold my beloved Olds after I sold my business and retired. It was a 1978 Delta, and it was in perfect shape after 114,000 miles and 10 years' service. American cars are good if well maintained and garaged.
Stop adulating the Japanese cars!

Whiz Bang Mechanixcq
 Your citation of Tom McCahill in your column evokes memories that are older than you are. I was a founding editor of Mechanix Illustrated magazine, originally titled Modern Mechanix.
Profits from Captain Billy's Whiz Bang were the foundation of the business. Meredith Wilson mentioned Whiz Bang in "The Music Man," but I suspect the reference is meaningless to today's baby boomers. It was a reputedly raunchy little joke book, but its most daring double entendres were on the order of "Katie often visited the stables and all the horsemen knew her."
We gave birth to Mechanix in a third-floor office in Robbinsdale, Minn., surrounded by other magazines: Whiz Bang, Jim Jam Jems, Smokehouse Monthly, True Confessions and some detective and screen-fan books. In our day, the ads promised that Studebaker would never adopt dangerous hydraulic brakes (theirs were mechanical), and automatic shifts were far in the future.
We launched Mechanix in 1928. Zounds! That's 63 years ago! But we did lay a foundation and hoped to entice perceptive young readers like you. McCahill would be proud.
 
Donald G. Cooley

 Tom McCahill was an auto writer who never stopped beating the drum for seatbelts and better visibility back in the late 40's and in the 50's. He had an impact, and he was one of my favorites. I wish I'd written him a letter. M. S.

HEADLINE: All About/Compact Disks;
Recordings Off? CD's Miss the Message

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
With the long-playing album market falling further into oblivion, the standard cassette tape fading fast and DAT, or digital audio tape, nearly dead on arrival, it looks like compact disks are here to stay.
But accompanying the rapid rise of CD's is a growing debate about what to do about their wasteful packaging and how to bring down their prices. The answer to the packaging problem should begin appearing by next summer. But the question of when the cost of the newest CD's will start to come down is harder to answer. 
 By now nearly everyone but the most die-hard vinyl enthusiast has heard -- and raved about -- the remarkably pristine sounds that compact disks can generate. Available only since 1983, CD's have taken the music business by storm and now account for 43.6 percent, or 286 million units, of all the music sold annually. That is up from 3 percent, or 23 million units sold as recently as 1985. Last year, Americans spent about $3.45 billion (based on manufacturers' suggested list prices) on CD's, a year-over-year increase of about 33 percent, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.
"The customer who collects music and plays it at home is buying CD's," said Russell Solomon, the owner of the Tower Records retail chain.
 
Why the Slump?
The Recession Or High Prices?
 But despite the growing popularity of CD's, this year the recording industry in general has fallen into a slump. A recent issue of Rolling Stone magazine said sales of recorded music are off this year by as much as 20 percent from a $7.54 billion total, at wholesale, last year. The head of the Recording Industry Association, Jay Berman, says the decline is closer to 10 percent, but drop it is. Natalie Cole's "Unforgettable" is the single most glaring exception. That album has so far sold about 2 million copies, or 350,000 copies a week; 49 percent of all sales have been CD's. The CD price is $16.98 while the tape price is $13.98 and vinyl is $11.99.
There are several reasons for the slump: the weak economy has prompted consumers to spend less on music and some of the major retailers are overextended, causing them to pare down their stock. But retailers say the relatively high cost of CD's has also hurt sales.
Just over 30 percent of all the money spent on music each year is spent by kids between the ages of 10 and 19, with the biggest spenders between 15 and 19. These young buyers buy mainly pop and rock. But this crowd is hard pressed to hand over $13.99 for a hot new CD. Although some CD's sell for as little as $5, the music that appeals to teen-agers is at the top of the price chart.
"The market that may be in jeopardy is the young kids who want to buy CD's but can't afford, for example, the new Guns-N-Roses albums, which are the most expensive," said Mr. Solomon. "Music companies do not want to lower prices," he added.
So far this year, few recording companies are racking up big profits. The music division of Time Warner, which comprises Warner Brothers, Elektra, Atlantic, Reprise and other labels, has had two unprofitable quarters this year. Others are also smarting.
Recording industry executives often defend their pricing of CD's by pointing to the rising cost involved in bringing out a new album. They also say that the number of CD's available at below the "front-line" prices has increased dramatically.
"You have to look at the total cost" of producing a CD, said Paul R. Smith, president of Sony Music Distribution, one of the dominant distribution companies. "We do believe there is price sensitivity particularly to new artists, but it is only the superstars who get $15.98 now.".
 
The New Quality
Reminiscences Being Reissued
 Pop and rock are the best-selling categories for all recorded music, accounting for 57.3 percent of the dollars spent in 1989, according to the association. But there has also been a huge increase in the percentage of dollars spent on jazz from 3 percent in 1985 to 5.7 percent in 1989. Classical music accounted for 5 percent of the dollars spent on CD's in 1985; it now accounts for only 4.3 percent of all sales. The total dollars spent on classical CD's has increased over the years, despite a falling share of the total market.
For the music companies the success of CD's has also provided them with an opportunity to mine their catalogues by reissuing classic albums in the new format. Although most labels have already exploited the bulk of their back list, others are reaching even further into the past for the hits of the 1990's. Columbia Records, a unit of Sony, recently released a collection by Robert Johnson, a Mississippi blues singer from the 1930's. That album has become a big seller.
"With CD's you have a significant improvement in quality," Mr. Smith said, adding that reissues of old recordings have brought back music buyers in droves.
 
Packaging Problems
Probable Solution Is a Smaller Box
 The hottest issue surrounding CD's today has to do with packaging. CD's typically are packaged in the "long box" -- a cardboard package that surrounds the plastic "jewel box" that actually holds the disk. The long box was designed to be about twice as long as the jewel box so it would be harder to shoplift and could be stacked in racks once used for LP's. But long boxes account for millions of pounds of waste each year. This has prompted an outcry, even among recording artists.
"The industry agrees that the 6-by-12 long box is a dead issue," as Mr. Smith put it. Now, he added, "The challenge is to find a suitable replacement that satisfies the consumer and deals with the concerns of the merchant."
Mr. Smith and others estimate that within the next year the industry will settle on a uniform replacement for the long box that is big enough to make the retailers happy but modest enough to eliminate the throwaway cardboard.
Music companies like Warner and Sony are currently surveying consumers to see what they would buy. Among the possible answers are a folding box that expands and contracts and is not discarded and a plastic package that folds shut like a drawer.
 
 
 
RAP MUSIC KEEPS CASSETTES AFLOAT
 With each passing year, the cassette tape cedes a little more room to compact disks. According to retailers and record executives, cassette sales are declining fast and would be falling faster were it not for the high cost of CD's and the emergence of rap music.
"Cassette tape sales as a percentage of the market probably peaked about four or five years ago," said Russell Solomon, head of the Tower Records retail chain. "Now the tape business is falling dramatically. The only thing really selling on tape is rap and rock and roll."
According to the Recording Industry Association, cassettes accounted for about 51 percent of all dollar sales last year, down from 60.4 percent in 1988. CD's accounted for 43.6 percent of all dollar sales last year.
As long as the prices of new hit CD's remain out of the reach of the average teen-age buyer, cassettes will have a strong place in the market. And a new hot-selling rap or pop artist can substantially boost a company's cassette sales. Sony Music, for example, has seen its cassette business supported largely by sales of New Kids on the Block.
High-end classical music has almost disappeared on cassette because of the superior sound of CD's. In fact, the format has made the classical area profitable for music companies for the first time in many years.
"Only with CD's did classical become a profitable area for the record companies," said Guenther Hensler, the head of BMG Classics."

The Coup's Aftermath: Will Gorbachev Be the Loser?
The coup last week in the Soviet Union failed before most people outside of Russia could learn how to pronounce the plotters' names. But it demonstrated powerfully how deeply the Soviet Union has committed itself to reform. "Even the heads of the K.G.B. and the military could not succeed with a coup," said Vladimir Kvint, a lecturer at Fordham University. "That means political risk has diminished. Investment in the Soviet Union is safe." But the Soviet Union still is likely to undergo more wrenching change. Boris N. Yeltsin's heroic stand elevated his status even more. He will no doubt use it to push harder for autonomy for the 15 republics. "Yeltsin already has agreed to recognize the Baltic States as independent," said Mr. Kvint. The real loser from the coup may turn out to be Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Though he will stay on as President, he will become "a king without a kingdom," Mr. Kvint said.
 
Flat-Screen Ruling Falls Flat
When your job is policing world trade, the toes you step on may be your own. When the U.S. International Trade Commission said that certain Japanese companies were dumping flat-panel computer display screens onto the American market, it thought it was doing the American producers a favor. Its ruling enabled the government to impose duties as high as 62 percent on the offending products. But last week, Japan's Hosiden Corporation, the biggest seller of advanced displays, said it would stop exporting its screens to the United States, sending a chill through Silicon Valley. Hosiden will still sell to American companies in Europe, sparking worries that the Apple Computer Company and others who use Hosiden's screens will now assemble their laptops overseas. That causes some to wonder whom the commission is protecting.
 
Whither the Soviet Economy?
Few people now question the Soviet Union's commitment to democracy. What they question is its economy. After six years of perestroika, there is still no workable economic plan. No wonder Western investment is flagging and banks, worried about defaults, have cut back on lending. According to the Institute for Comparative Economic Studies in Vienna, less than $3.5 billion has been invested by Western firms in the Soviet Union since 1987. Will the failed coup spur investment? "We aren't rushing out and doing anything now," said Ron Roberts, a spokesman for the Eastman Kodak Company, which sells film there.
 
Caveat Dolphins
When the United States banned Mexican tuna, it was for environmental reasons. Mexican fishing methods were not "dolphin safe." But Mexico objected to that characterization. Dolphin-safe fishing, they said, was merely a pretext to keep foreign tuna off American shelves. The Mexican Government argued its case to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva. Last week, a three-person panel ruled in Mexico's favor. Never mind the dolphins, the panel said. The United States has no legal right to tell another nation how to catch fish in international waters. "This is quite a blow to conservation of wildlife," said Nina M. Young of the Center for Marine Conservation in Washington.
 
Boeing Gets a Beat on Airbus
Last week the Boeing Company proved once more that it had the right stuff. British Airways chose Boeing to supply its fleet with $6.85 billion worth of new jets, beating out Europe's Airbus Industries. The deal is for 15 of the 777 twin jets and 24 747-400 jumbo jets. For the first time, British Airways chose General Electric engines.
 
The Push for Antimatter
Everyone knows that Starship Enterprise from "Star Trek" owes its speed to an antimatter engine. Antimatter packs a lot of punch. Just one-hundredth of a gram, Air Force scientists say, could generate the propulsive power of 120 tons of conventional rocket fuel. But how to make the stuff? Last week, scientists at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, and at Heidelberg University in Germany, said they think antimatter can be made with particle accelerators that already exist. If they are right, antimatter might not have to wait until the 25th century to propel vehicles into space.

 
COMPANIES

 
Salomon's Contingency Plan
Salomon Brothers Inc. may have tarnished its name and lost several of its classiest clients -- at least temporarily. Its chief counsel may also have been forced to quit. But Solly is determined not to run short of cash. Instead of selling commercial paper to raise money, Salomon will use what are called "repurchasing agreements" to keep its financial base. "Repos" are short-term contracts to sell securities and buy them back later at a fixed price. For Solly, these agreements amount to high-quality, short-term loans that will keep its borrowing costs down. Since Salomon has Treasury instruments worth about $10 billion, it hopes the contingency plan can keep the firm going until it can polish its name. "As long as the contingency plan is playing out, we don't expect to have any funding problems for several weeks into the future," said Donald S. Howard, Salomon's chief financial officer. But who knows how long the mess will take to clean up?
 
Another Real Estate Casualty
When Peter Kalikow, one of New York's biggest real estate developers and the publisher of the New York Post, filed for personal bankruptcy last week, even his silk stockings were protected. Mr. Kalikow's liabilities exceed his assets by about $400 million. Those liabilities include a $107,000 tab at Bergdorf Goodman, the tony New York department store. For Mr. Kalikow, who was badly hurt by the sagging New York real estate market, filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code, will give him time to reorganize his holdings. The filing will not affect The New York Post. Unlike New York real estate, The Post has been profitable all year.
 
Lower Fares After Labor Day
Now that summer -- and vacations -- are almost over, the airlines are lowering their fares. American Airlines and US Air said they would reduce some restricted supersaver fares by as much as 28 percent beginning on Sept. 4. "The cuts are deeper than usual for the fall," said Ray Neidl, an analyst at Dillon, Reed & Company. The airlines fear another lackluster year.
 
Taking G.E. to Court
The lawyers squabbled for years but could not cut a deal. So last week five Midwestern utilities filed charges against the General Electric Company in a U.S. District Court in Cleveland alleging that the contractor did shoddy work in designing the $5.4 billion Perry Nuclear Power Plant outside of Cleveland, which opened in 1987. The suit also said G.E. designed a nuclear containment shield that leaked. The utilities are asking for punitive damages. G.E. denies it did a bad job. The problem, it said, was not that the reactor shield leaked. It was that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission changed its containment requirements after the project began. The case is likely to take years to decide.
 
A Deal for Harcourt Brace
When Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. tried to fend off a takeover attack by the British press baron Robert Maxwell in 1987, it did it by borrowing about $1.8 billion to buy back some of its stock. Mr. Maxwell was thwarted, but Harcourt was crippled in the process. Last week, the General Cinema Corporation, a movie-theater owner in Newton, Mass., sweetened an offer it made last January to buy Harcourt. The proposal, worth about $1.5 billion, gives Harcourt's stock holders 75 cents worth of General Cinema stock for each Harcourt share they own. Harcourt's shares have been selling lately for about 50 cents. Harcourt's bondholders would get between 47 and 100 cents on each dollar of debt. The new proposal has a good chance of being accepted. "We already have agreement from the committee representing the majority of bondholders," a spokesman for General Cinema said. If a deal is not made, most analysts think, Harcourt will be headed for bankruptcy.
 
Yet Another Scandal Heard From
The scandals wafting through the international business community are not limited to finance. Victor D. Cohen, a former deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force, pleaded guilty before a U.S. District Court Judge in Alexandria, Va., to conspiracy to defraud the Government and to accepting bribes. Mr. Cohen, who bought high-tech electronic components for the Air Force, admitted that he helped clients of a consultant, William Galvin, win some big contracts. For helping Mr. Galvin's friends Mr. Cohen received at least $123,000. He now faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and fines of $500,000.

 
THE ECONOMY

 
The Dishwasher as Harbinger
If it were not for durable goods, the economy would look like it had really lost its snap. But last month, orders surged by 10.7 percent for big-ticket items like dishwashers and cars that are supposed to last at least three years or more. That jump was the biggest increase in 21 years, according to the Commerce Department. With such a big jump in orders for durable goods economists fear interest rates will fall no further. "If the Fed was thinking about easing credit next week, this will cause a delay," Fred Leiner, a market strategist at Continental Bank in Chicago, said.
 
More Unemployment Line Blues
If the economy is recovering, why are all those people still losing their jobs? That is the question economists were wrestling with last week when the Labor Department announced that 430,000 people -- 22,000 more than the week before -- filed unemployment claims in the first full week of August. Does this mean the recovery is history? Not quite, according to the economists. It simply means the recovery is moving "at a snail's pace," said Donald Ratajczak, an economist at Georgia State University.
 
Late Night With the F.D.A.
Last week, the Federal Drug Administration changed the channel on late-night television, the time of day some cable and broadcast companies plug holes in their programming with videos produced by pharmaceutical companies. Officials at the new, activist F.D.A. have watched the programs without amusement. They look too much like documentaries, the F.D.A. says. From now on, the F.D.A. will preview videos before they are shown.

HEADLINE: Salomon's Errant Cowboy

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
Wall Street bond traders have two theories about what happened at Salomon Brothers Inc. One is the conspiracy theory. The other involves Paul W. Mozer.
 The conspiracy theory contends that Salomon was deliberately trying to manipulate the Treasury market for its own gain and that if the top brass, including the firm's crusty chairman, John H. Gutfreund, didn't actually encourage it, they at least looked the other way. They did so because the practice had the potential to earn immense profits for Salomon. 
The second theory is that Mr. Mozer, the head of Salomon's Government-bond trading desk, acted without permission and that Salomon's senior management had no knowledge that a cowboy in their midst was continually flouting Treasury rules.
 Much of the evidence made public to date supports the Mozer theory, and Warren Buffett, the respected Omaha investor brought in as an interim chairman to clean up Salomon, evidently believes it.
 But even if this theory is correct it nevertheless fails to explain why Mr. Gutfreund and three other senior Salomon executives waited more than three months before telling Federal officials about Mr. Mozer's improper action and taking steps to see that it didn't happen again.
 Not taking action immediately -- suspending Mr. Mozer, for example, launching an investigation and informing the Government -- shattered Mr. Gutfreund's 38-year career at Salomon and also ended those of Thomas W. Strauss, Salomon's president, and John W. Meriwether, a vice chairman. This past Friday, Donald M. Feuerstein, Salomon's general counsel, also resigned.
 Should the conspiracy theory gain enough credence, it has the potential to further erode investor confidence in Salomon, perhaps even lead to its failure. .
 But numerous interviews with Salomon executives and traders, as well as alumni of the firm -- many of whom refused to be quoted by name -- provide a revealing portrait of Mr. Mozer and his role in the bidding affair.
 By all accounts, Mr. Mozer earned widespread respect from colleagues for his intelligence, fairness and energy. Although many traders at Salomon have been depicted as loud, aggressive and given to juvenile antics like food fights, Mr. Mozer was relatively calm and even-tempered. "He was not one of those who went stomping around the trading floor," said one Salomon trader who worked near him.
 He was also a classic trading-desk workaholic who always carried a calculator-like device that allowed him to constantly monitor markets around the world.
 
Mozer's Ascent
 Mr. Mozer joined Salomon's Chicago office as a corporate bond salesman in 1979, after majoring in economics at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., and earning a master's degree in management at Northwestern University. In 1980, he began selling Government bonds for the firm, and by 1983 had impressed superiors sufficiently to warrant a transfer to New York.
 In 1985, he was plucked from a lowly position on the Government-bond sales desk and invited to join Salomon's prestigious bond-arbitrage unit, a group of "high-tech" traders who employ sophisticated computer programs to take advantage of tiny discrepancies in prices between markets and between financial products. The group was headed by Mr. Meriwether, a brilliant trader who saw early on that computer-based trading was the wave of the future. During some quarters, Mr. Merriweather's elite band generated the bulk of Salomon's profits.
 After just a year and a half, Mr. Mozer was named a managing director. And when E. Craig Coats Jr., the head of the firm's Government-bond desk resigned in 1988 to set up his own firm, Paul Mozer got the job.
 By most accounts, Mr. Mozer's style was quite different from that of Mr. Coats. He relished talking with customers directly, instead of having sales people do it. Over time, say Salomon traders, he came to be the person who talked with the firm's largest customers the most, personally taking their orders in the frantic minutes before a Treasury auction deadline.
 But friends and former colleagues say that the longer Mr. Mozer held his job, the more consumed he became with his work. His business was buying bonds and keeping Salomon's shelves filled with inventory that could be sold for a profit. That meant being aggressive indeed.
 For the head of a Government-bond desk like Mr. Mozer, the object at a Treasury auction was to bid as low as possible for the bonds, without bidding so low as to lose out on the sale. The way the Treasury auction works, bonds are parcelled out first to the buyer willing to pay the most. Then the Treasury goes to the next highest bidder and fills that allotment. It gradually works its way down the bidding hierarchy. When it gets to those who are the lowest, it divies out bonds in proportion to the size of the bid.
 Thus, the larger the bid at a low price, the more bonds a dealer is likely end up with. And the lower the bid, the more a firm like Salomon will make when it turns around and sells those bonds in the public market. When Paul Mozer moved to his new job, the Treasury had no limit on how much of a bond issue any one firm could bid for, though a firm could actually buy no more than 35 percent. Mr. Mozer gradually began putting in bids for larger and larger amounts. When the Treasury came to his low bid and awarded him a percentage of it, he would often end up with more bonds than other competitors, all bought at the cheapest price.
 By July, 1990, according to bond market participants, Mr. Mozer's bids had gone off the charts. In one auction for $5 billion of 30-year Resolution Funding Corporation bonds, Salomon, under Mr. Mozer's direction, was said to have bid an astonishing $15 billion. "He embarrassed the Treasury," said one Salomon trader.
 
Losing Tempers
 In fact, the Treasury got so annoyed with Mr. Mozer at the R.F.C. auction that the next day it slapped on new rules. From now on, it said, no one would be allowed to submit a bid for more than 35 percent of an issue at any one price level.
 Mr. Mozer was furious at the Treasury's attempt to curtail his activities. "As a practical proposition, the Treasury was very rash in making their decision without any prior consultation with the primary dealers," he told The New York Times at the time. "The Treasury has tied the hands of large dealers who time in and time out are the ones who underwrite the Treasury's debt."
 For its part, the Treasury was so angry with Mr. Mozer, said Salomon traders, both for his public statements and his behavior, that Salomon had to remove him as the person who had the closest contact with the Treasury. Dealing with the Treasury fell to Mr. Mozer's colleague, Thomas Murphy. (Along with Mr. Mozer, Mr. Murphy was fired by the Salomon board last Sunday.)
 Salomon executives who have examined what happened said they now believe that Mr. Mozer was determined to show that he could get around the Treasury's regulations. "He thought he was bigger than the U. S. Treasury," was how one senior Treasury official is said to have described Mr. Mozer.
 No one at Salomon has suggested that there were any problems with Treasury bids until the auction last December, after the rules had changed. That month, according to Salomon, Mr. Mozer submitted a maximum bid of 35 percent for the firm in an $8.57 billion auction of four-year notes. At some point, he took a fateful step: He submitted another bid for $1 billion using the name of a customer without any authorization from the customer. The two bids together comprised 46 percent of the issue. The unauthorized bid apparently went undetected.
 In February, when the Treasury was issuing $9.04 billion of five-year notes, Mr. Mozer submitted a bid in Salomon's name for 35 percent, and two others each at the maximum level of 35 percent in the names of customers who had not authorized such bids. One was Mercury Asset Management Group, an affiliate of the British merchant bank, S. G. Warburg Group
 Mr. Mozer's bold tactic earned Salomon 57 percent of the issue. Amazingly, Salomon executives who are now retracing Mr. Mozer's steps say his February actions caused Salomon to lose money -- another reason why they believe his tactics were more about ego and getting the best of the Treasury than they were about earning bonuses or career enhancement at Salomon.
 "He just wanted to buy bonds," said one Salomon executive, describing Mr. Mozer's passion to be the best Government bond trader around.
 But the Treasury Department had apparently noticed something unusual.
 
A Key Letter
 Sometime in April, according to Salomon, Mr. Mozer received a copy of a letter from the Treasury reminding Mercury Asset Management that any bids submitted by the Warburg affiliate should be lumped together with Warburg's bid so that the total bid by both parent and affiliate did not exceed 35 percent of the auction.
 To anyone who knew that bids had been submitted in customers' names without their knowledge, the letter was a clear sign of trouble ahead. "If you were Mr. Mozer and you got that letter, you would know you had a problem," said Mr. Buffett at a news conference last Sunday.
 But to anyone who didn't know about irregularities at Salomon, , the letter might have seemed far less ominous. "I think they were saying, 'explain this.' . . . I don't think there was anything accusatory about that letter," said Mr. Buffett, although he conceded that he had not yet seen it.
 On April 27, four days after his 36th birthday, Mr. Mozer went to his boss, Mr. Meriwether, showed him the letter and told him of the one unauthorized bid, according to Salomon officials. Mr. Meriwether asked Mr. Mozer whether he had committed any other trading violations, Mr. Buffett said.
 "Mr. Mozer looked him in the eye and said, 'No'," according to Mr. Buffett.
 Mr. Meriwether then called Mr. Strauss, the firm's president, and told him what had happened. The next morning, the two men sat down with Mr. Feuerstein, the firm's chief legal officer, to discuss the matter. Mr. Gutfreund, who was traveling, was told about the situation the next day.
 Imagine the scene. Four of the firm's most senior officers are told that the head of their Government-bond desk has admitted submitting a $3.2 billion bid in a Treasury auction in the name of a customer who has no knowledge of the bid and in direct violation of Government regulations. And this same person has already angered the Treasury Department so deeply that the agency changed its regulations to constrain him.
 According to Mr. Buffett, the four men were all in agreement that this was an offense that had to be reported to the Government. Yet they apparently took Mr. Mozer at his word that this was the only such offense, and they left him in place as the head of the firm's all-important Government-bond desk.
 
A Matter of Trust
 Then, inexplicably, for the next four weeks they apparently did nothing of substance. Mr. Buffett says he asked Mr. Meriwether whether anyone told him it was his job to report the incident. "John says no. I believe him," Mr. Buffett said. As for the firm's general counsel, Mr. Buffett said, "I have no reason to question his efforts or enthusiasm in terms of moving the information." Nevertheless, five days later, Mr. Buffett requested, and got, Mr. Feuerstein's resignation.
 What about Mr. Gutfreund? Mr. Buffett was less charitable. "It could well be that one thought another was doing it," Mr. Buffett said. "I have seen it happen. It does not happen very often."
 None of the four men are talking. But one theory to explain their lack of action is that if senior managers were going to report it to the Treasury, they would have wanted to approach a Government official who would give them a decent hearing. And given Mr. Mozer's previous history with certain Treasury officials, Salomon would have to tread very carefully. All that might take time.
 But most current and former Salomon executives interviewed found the delay inexplicable. They note that in the past, Mr. Gutfreund has been unforgiving in punishing those he even remotely suspected of doing something wrong. Former employees recall at least two incidents when he fired traders "in a heartbeat" when he thought they might be engaging in unethical behavior.
 It is certainly plausible, said some who know Mr. Gutfreund well, that this time around, he may have hoped that in time some rational explanation or solution to the "Mozer problem" might be found. After all, it was just one transaction, a single mistake, he was told. And the Treasury's letter didn't sound that serious.
 As for Mr. Strauss, Salomon executives describe him as affable and easy to get along with but sometimes prone to indecisiveness, unlikely to take the initiative in reporting Mr. Mozer's misdeed.
 Then came May 22, the day the Treasury auctioned $12.26 billion of two-year notes. This time, according to Salomon, Mr. Mozer bid the 35 percent maximum, plus $2 billion for a customer. Although there is no suggestion that he did so without the customer's knowledge, he subsequently repurchased $500 million worth of bonds from the customer at the auction price, an unusual maneuver that was similar to a trade he had conducted in the April Treasury auction. Asked about it last week, a Treasury spokesman declined to comment on the particulars of Salomon repurchasing bonds, but said, "The Treasury has a rule that there can be no pre-arrangement on repurchasing bonds."
 Mr. Mozer also neglected to tell the Treasury that the firm had already committed to purchasing $497 million of the bonds in the "when issued" market, where bonds are traded before they are actually issued. That amount should have been counted toward the firm's 35 percent bidding limit. Nor did Salomon disclose to the Treasury that its energy subsidiary, Phibro, purchased $105 million of the bonds in the auction, a mistake that officials do not blame on Mr. Mozer, but describe as inadvertent.
 
In a Squeeze
 All told, Salomon acquired 45 percent of the bonds. This time, however, there was little chance that it would go undetected. Many traders at other firms had decided to "short" that particular Treasury issue. That means they had committed to sell the bonds without actually owning them, on the assumption that they would be able to buy the bonds later at a lower price, making a greater profit when they resold them.
 But the traders found that several large firms owned so many of the bonds that they had effectively "cornered" the market, forcing people to pay much more to cover their short positions than they had expected.
 Losses sprouted all over Wall Street. So did the howls of outrage. Representative Edward M. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, received a number of complaints from traders and asked regulators to look into the matter. By the end of May, Salomon; Steinhardt Partners, an asset management fund, and a fund run by George Soros were among those named in the financial press as having "squeezed" the market. A squeeze is not necessarily illegal -- unless it occurred because a group of traders acted in concert.
 One Salomon trader remembers that Mr. Gutfreund was fuming about Mr. Mozer's activities in May. It may have contributed further to delays in reporting the February episode, since the May auction could have been seen as another incident to be unraveled before approaching the Government.
 
'Unfolding Events'
 According to Deryck C. Maughan, who Mr. Buffett chose as Salomon's new chief of operations: "I would say that as we listened to the accounts, one event seemed to overtake another. It was only one episode we were told. Then the May auction happened. Attention was paid to that. It was a series of unfolding events."
 By the end of May, Mssrs. Gutfreund, Strauss, Meriwether and Feuerstein knew that Mr. Mozer may have been up to more than they originally realized. But still they did not suspend Mr. Mozer or ask him to step aside while they conducted an internal investigation. Nor did they ask their outside counsel, Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, to conduct an investigation. And they did not inform Federal regulators.
 In fact, Salomon did not turn to its outside counsel until early July, after Government regulators had apparently subpoenaed its trading documents. Mr. Buffett said that Wachtell, Lipton was finally called in because of, "senior management's concern that they were not getting the full story."
 But Mr. Buffett was at a loss to explain why four or five weeks elapsed between the time the law firm was apprised of the situation and the time that they and Salomon approached the Government. Martin Lipton, the Wachtell, Lipton partner in charge of the Salomon investigations, did not return a reporter's calls.
 It was not until the evening of Aug. 8 that Mr. Gutfreund called Mr. Buffett, one of Salomon's largest investors, to inform him of the problem. That same evening, calls were placed to top Salomon officials alerting them to a special meeting the following day. At that meeting, according to some of those who were there, Mr. Gutfreund told the firm's managing directors that they had found a problem, had begun an investigation and there was no cause for alarm.
 A public statement was issued admitting some of the bidding irregularities and Mr. Mozer and Mr. Murphy were suspended. Many of those at the meeting left for the weekend thinking everything was under control. It wasn't until five days later that Mssrs. Gutfreund, Strauss and Meriwether acknowledged to their colleagues that they had known there was a problem for more than three months.
 Many Salomon executives were stunned by the second round of revelations. They could not believe that the firm's top officials had let the matter ride so long. Some concluded that senior managers had been trying to hide their inaction from their own managing directors at the meeting the Friday before.
 It was this omission that has partly fueled the conspiracy theory, which holds that the firm's top officials knew about -- and even encouraged -- Mr. Mozer's activities all along.
 After all, the theory goes, if Mr. Mozer and his colleagues could manipulate certain bond issues in the Treasury market, they would have better information than competitors about the direction of certain interest rates. And if Salomon knew what would happen to those rates, it could make huge profits by placing big bets in the bond and related markets, like futures and options.
 Everyone knew from Salomon's annual report that the area in which it made most of its money was what was known as "principal trading" -- that is, trading for its own account. Surely it was possible that in trying to buy so many Treasury securities, Mr. Mozer was merely carrying out the stated or unstated wishes of superiors. After all, Mr. Gutfreund and Mr. Strauss were known for being avid bond traders themselves. They bragged that they sat on Salomon's raucous trading floor, that they were hands-on managers, ever present at Treasury auction time.
 "How could they not have known?" is the cry on Wall Street. There are several possible reasons.
 One factor was Mr. Mozer's unusually close relationship with major Salomon customers. As the pressure built toward the 1 P.M. bid deadline on auction day, he would personally take large customer orders, scribbling down numbers on slips of paper that few others could read or follow. One trader who sat nearby, said, "I never had any idea what he was doing."
 Mr. Gutfreund, Mr. Strauss and Mr. Meriwether may indeed have conferred with Mr. Mozer about the shape of the firm's order book, the tone of the market and how much they were bidding for and at what price. But if someone wanted to disguise the fact that a large customer order had never actually been placed, there was no reason to be suspicious.
 The firm has daily position sheets, which show how many bonds the firm owns. And the three men undoubtedly reviewed them. But by the end of the day, if the sheet showed that the firm owned more than 35 percent of an auction, that would not necessarily have tipped them off. Salomon often bought and sold bonds in the secondary market after the auction was over, and there was nothing illegal about owning more than 35 percent of an issue at that point.
 As to the theory that Salomon was deliberately trying to manipulate certain interest rates so that its proprietary trading group could make huge profits, in only one of the four auctions that Mr. Mozer is said to have committed trading violations has anyone asserted that a squeeze actually developed.
 
Acting Alone?
 Salomon traders and executives also cite two facts that tend to support the theory that Mr. Mozer was acting of his own accord.
 One is that many of the trades of the bond arbitrage group run by Mr. Meriwether are extremely complex and extend over many months. Traders say that a short-term blip in certain interest rates generated by auction bidding would not necessarily offer that group any real opportunities.
 Also, those who believe the conspiracy theory are forced to go up against the much-respected Mr. Buffett, whose assurances to Federal officials last week persuaded the Treasury Department not to take harsh discplinary action against Salomon. At Salomon's press conference last week, Mr. Buffett faced a crowd of reporters and said that he did not believe that Mssrs. Gutfreund, Strauss, or Meriwether had any knowledge of what Mr. Mozer had been doing, or that they in any way participated in what he described as a coverup by altering records, or that they knew of any other offenses the firm had committed.
 "They told me, and I believe, that they know of nothing else," he said. "I believe that."
Last week, Mr. Mozer was closeted with his lawyers, apparently preparing for Federal investigations and readying a defense for the lawsuits that Salomon customers are filing, which name the firm and often include him as a defendant as well.

HEADLINE: At Farmers' Markets, the Crush of Customers Is Expanding

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
NOW that coupons are being accepted at farmers' markets in New York State, tens of thousands of low-income families have joined the regular customers at farmers' markets, "helping themselves and New York State farmers," said Commissioner Richard McGuire of the Department of Agriculture and Markets.
Under the 1991 New York State farmers' market coupon program, 66,900 low-income families enrolled in the Social Supplement Food Program for Women, Infants and Children receive $20 in coupons redeemable at 83 farmers' markets in the state. And for the first time this year an additional 5,000 low-income elderly are receiving $10 in coupons. 
 At the farmers' market in downtown Getty Square in Yonkers, Florence Schmidt, the market manager, has noticed the new customers.
 
Most Successful Year
 "We have been operating for seven years with five upstate farmers," Mrs. Schmidt said. "Most of them come back year after year. This is the most successful year we have had, and I believe it's because more coupons have been alloted."
The Getty Square market is open from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. Thursdays from July to mid-November.
The coupons have made it possible for more families in the supplemental food program to buy fruits and vegetables, Mrs. Schmidt said, adding, "Mothers rave about the fresh produce and the wide selection, which they rarely get a chance to buy."
Farmers are reimbursed for the coupons by market sponsors, using checks drawn on special bank accounts established with Federal and state funds. Any farmer selling fresh fruits and vegetables at an authorized farmers' market may participate.
"The coupon program has been successful in expanding the access of low-income families to fresh produce," Mr. McGuire said, explaining that the program gives vouchers to low-income families to buy fruit and vegetables that other Federal programs do not cover.
The farmers' markets in Westchester, of course, already had a strong following. After the new Peekskill farmers' Market opened on July 13, for example, Patricia Esposito, the manager, said, "I didn't realize people would get so excited about a head of lettuce. We've had far more business than we anticipated. Customers start lining up at 7:30 A.M. even though our official opening time is 8 o'clock."
Ms. Esposito, the executive director of the Peekskill/Cortlandt Chamber of Commerce, said that plans for this new market had been in the works for two years and were conceived as a way to revitalize downtown Peekskill.
The Peekskill market -- which is open from 8 A.M. to 2 P.M. Saturdays from mid-July to early November -- has also drawn "a lot of customers from upscale towns like Chappaqua, Pound Ridge and all of northern Westchester," Ms. Esposito said. "You only have to bite into a fresh peach to know why.
"We've also tried to make the market a lively place that attracts people. Ours is more than a produce stand. For instance, we have a vineyard: Prejan Vineyard from Syracuse sells wares here. We also have stands that sell special breads, roasted nuts and dried fruits, jams and honey and other goodies."
Farmer-to-consumer direct marketing in New York State accounts for more than $112 million a year in retail farm income, and New York State farmers' markets make up an important part of that trade, Mr. McGuire said, adding that more than 1,000 farm families depend on farmers' markets to sell their produce.
More and more people like Myra Fransen and Karen Steefel also depend on farmers' markets for their weekly shopping.
On a recent Friday, at the Green Seasons farmers' Market in New Rochelle, they could choose organic eggs, cheeses, bunches of fragrant basil, deep red tomatoes, new potatoes, first-of-the-season McIntosh apples, loaves of whole wheat and honey breads, blueberry pies and bouquets of marigolds and zinnias.
 
'I Feel Much Healthier'
 At the market, which is open from 8 A.M. to 6 P.M. from early July to mid-November, Ms. Fransen was buying eggs and cheddar cheese from David Wengerd of the Amish Farms.
"I love this market," she said. "I come every Friday, because I know I'm getting much better value for my money when I buy quality food here. Fresh food is very important to me. I feel much healthier when I eat well."
Ms. Steefel, with her baby strapped in a pouch on her back, said she, too, was a regular patron.
 
Supporting the Farmers
 "The market is so interesting," she said. "It's always an adventure. I love the variety. You never know what you're going to find. I've had all kinds of herbs, white eggplant and raspberries in season. I strongly feel that unless we support small farmers they will disappear. And our choices will be limited to what the mammoth agricultural industries decide to grow."
An added attraction of the market, Ms. Fransen said, is the opportunity to talk to the farmers. "When I first started coming here, I was mainly interested in nutrition," she said, "but when farmers told me that customers like myself were helping to support small family farms, I felt good."
One such farmer, Werner Kohlmier of Kohlmier Farm in Hopewell Junction, leaves home at 4:30 A.M. in order to bring fruit, vegetables and loaves of bread baked by his mother to market in New Rochelle.
 
Dependent on the Markets
 Kohlmier Farm, with 200 acres of vegetables under cultivation, is largely dependent on farmers' markets to sell what they grow, he said.
"But the market is more than selling," said Mr. Kohlmier, who works the family farm with his father, Norbert. "Farming is demanding; you don't get much of a chance to meet people. What helps to make it all worthwhile is talking to customers. Many of ours are regulars who come back year after year. And when they tell me how much they appreciate what we grow, it's like a shot in the arm."
Mr. Kohlmier also listens closely to customers' requests. "We grow what they want. Herbs, for example. We got into herbs a couple of years ago, and we grow a dozen different varieties. Also, we grow pot plants, which we sell in season."
 
Profitable for Farmers
 David Wengerd, along with 25 members of his family, runs Amish Farms in Bloomsbury, Pa. In addition to the market in New Rochelle, the Wengerd clan sells corn, herbs, all types of lettuce, tomatoes, potatoes, squash, beans, peppers, eggplants and eggs, pies, cheeses, honey and jam at 24 other farmers' markets each week.
"How do we do? Very well," said Mr. Wengerd. "About 400 percent better than we'd be doing selling wholesale. It's the difference of getting 25 cents a pound for selling tomatoes, for instance, to a supplier, or getting $1 a pound when we sell them directly to the customer."
Mr. Wengerd said that at the largest farmers' market in the area, Greenmarket in Manhattan's Union Square, farmers can make up to $10,000 a day.
 
'A 'Win-Win Situation'
 "It's a win-win situation. Everybody benefits," said Robert A. Lewis, chief marketing representative of New York State Department of Agriculture and Marketing in Brooklyn, who provides assistance to Westchester farmers' markets.
"Because there are no middlemen and transportation costs are low, consumers are able to get fresh fruits and vegetables at prices that are 5 to 30 percent lower than at retail stores."
Without the markets, Mr. Lewis said, many family farms, too small to produce volume crops, would be forced to sell.

HEADLINE: Canon's Proposed Move Upsets Brookville

BYLINE: By LISA BETH PULITZER

 BODY:
IN 1940, Nassau County had 439 farms. Today there are six, five of them north of Jericho Turnpike. The vast farming region called Cedar Swamp has gone from farmland to home for horse breeders and yacht owners.
Now the Village of Brookville, one of 11 incorporated villages that make up Cedar Swamp, faces a crossroads.
Canon U.S.A. Inc., the Japanese-owned camera and electronics company, is negotiating to buy 100 acres of choice property on Northern Boulevard from the financially strapped New York Institute of Technology for its headquarters. 
 The property now houses the de Seversky Center, once the Winston Frederick Churchill Guest house and now used for corporate conferences, weddings and a gourmet dining club. The center is named for Alexander P. de Seversky, a World War I flying ace who played a role in the invention of the helicopter and was a founder of the college.
Canon, now in Lake Success and previously bound for a large site in the redevelopment of Roosevelt Raceway, is trying to persuade the Village of Brookville to rezone the property from five-acre residential use to commercial use. Commercial zoning would permit Canon to use the land for conferences, training, education, research, administration and general office buildings. Many residents of Brookville and surrounding villages oppose changing the zoning. They fear it could pave the way for other commercial properties along the vast grassy strip.
"I don't want to see the commercialization of the whole stretch of Northern Boulevard from Greenvale to Cold Spring Harbor," said Ed Dugan, a former member of the Brookville Planning Board. The corporate counsel for Canon, Jay Cook, said the company "won't purchase the property until any necessary amendments to zoning or approval to allow us to build are granted." Canon last week revised its initial presentation to address residents' concerns about parking and traffic. The plan still has to go before the Village Board, the first step in a lengthy process.
Canon would have up to 1,500 employees on the new site, and parking for them would be in a two-level underground garage. In a slumping economy, with major employers reducing their work force, keeping the company on Long Island would have major significance for Long Island.
When it decided to move from Lake Success, Canon chose a site at the former Roosevelt Raceway in Westbury and paid an estimated $1 million an acre. But after almost four years of delays and inquiries questioning the propriety of the deal between the Town of Hempstead and the raceway, the company decided to look elsewhere.
"That deal is dead," Mr. Cook said. "We have no further interest in that property. We are concentrating solely on the site we have chosen in Brookville."
The cost for the 100 acres in Brookville is estimated at $200,000 an acre. Canon outlined its original proposal on July 17 to a meeting of the Village Board. The plan showed development of 5 percent of the parcel, leaving 95 acres as green belts. "That's impossible," a lawyer representing the Brookville Taxpayers Association, Robert Forchelli, said. "The five acres they say will be utilized is really a footprint of two buildings, three stories tall, that calculate out to up to 650,000 square feet. That's larger than one tower at EAB Plaza in Uniondale. In order to provide parking for a building of that magnitude, you will need 27 acres of parking."
Other people at the meeting said they were concerned that pollution from the employees' cars could seep into a prime aquifer, as well as sewage systems.
The architect for Canon, Angelo Corva, said: "The meeting was strictly informational. There was no plan, only a concept. We wanted to get the public's input. Now we are continuing to move along, preparing a more hard-line program with more specifics that will meet the concerns of the people."
The new plan calls for the use of 11.2 acres of land, approximately double the existing facility, and that new buildings would total 600,000 square feet, with no building taller than the existing mansion. The main access would be at the existing entrance to New York Tech, on 25A and serviced by a traffic light.
 For more than 20 years, Brookville has resisted plans for commercial building in the village. Mayor Michael Galgano said he had agreed to hear the Canon proposal and would meet with the Board of Trustees on the plan because of the problems at New York Tech and because 70 percent of the village taxes pay for services like fire and police protection. Half the land in the village is not taxable.
Canon would be the first major taxable contributor to the village, Mr. Galgano said. Canon would also pay taxes to the Town of Oyster Bay and Nassau County, as well as to the Jericho School District, one of three school systems covering the Brookvilles.
 
Plight of Institute
 The president of New York Tech, Dr. Matthew Schure, said selling the property, which includes the Guest house and a small private home occupied by the manager of the Guest house, would "make a very big impact on reducing the school's budget."
If Brookville does not approve the rezoning, the school says, it will deal with whatever constraints the village imposes, but it still wants to sell the site.
"We have major assets in real estate," Dr. Schure said. "All of the property that is not currently being used for academic purposes will be sold to reduce long-term debt."
One option for the village is to expand the special-use permit for New York Tech, limiting additional development by Canon. Although New York Tech is tax exempt, it gives $16,500 a year to the village.
According to a calculation from county assessments, the de Seversky Center, if taxable, would generate $25,000 a year for the village before any additional building on the property.
A vice president of the taxpayers' group, Steven Glazer, said the village tax was the smallest part of homeowners' taxes, about 10 percent. He said that if the area remained residential, "homes built on the site would go back into our tax roll, adding money to the village and children to our schools."
Mr. Glazer added that two schools, North Shore and Locust Valley, would not see tax benefits from Canon. He added that his group wanted Canon to remain in Nassau County, "but please put your headquarters in a commercial area."
 
'Clean and Reasonably Compatible'
 The supporters of Canon include the Long Island Association, and Lee Koppelman, head of the Long Island Regional Planning Board.
"You have a public institution in need of some cash relief, perhaps in order to survive," the president of the Long Island Association, James Larocca, said, "and a corporate prospect that is clean and reasonably compatible."
But the president of the Birchwood Civic Association in Jericho, David Diamond, said, "Long Island has for too long allowed commercial development in an area that should be reserved for residential."
Mr. Larocca added: "What's particularly attractive is that Canon will be so completely buffered from the surrounding community. The open space will be preserved, and the headquarters will be set back from the road."
"The land-use planning," Mr. Koppelman said, "makes this an extremely promising endeavor." He said Canon would also create jobs for the region.
Some adjacent villages do not agree. The Upper Brookville Board of Trustees passed a resolution against the Canon plan and has sent a letter to Mr. Galgano stating its opposition.
Byam K. Stevens Jr., the Mayor of Muttontown, another of the six villages that share the Police Department with the Village of Brookville, also sent a letter to Mr. Galgano explaining that although he understood the attraction of Canon as a taxpayer, he believed that the residents of the area would prefer to pay higher taxes in lieu of commercial entities.
 
Stress at Northern Boulevard
 Laurence Werfel of Old Brookville, an architect with Werfel & Associates, said in an interview that he was concerned about the traffic impact. "The traffic situation available to serve that site is the intersection at Glen Cove Road and Northern Boulevard, which is now the second-most-used-corner in Nassau. To add to the impact of that corner would affect the Village of East Hills, the City of Glen Cove, all the Brookvilles and Old Westbury."
Mayor Gil Colombo of Old Westbury said that although his village did not have a position on the Canon plan, it was concerned about added traffic on Whitney Lane, a country road used by students of C. W. Post College and New York Tech.
The Village Administrator, Victoria Siegal, of East Hills said, "Our major concern is additional traffic on Route 25A."
Jericho and Brookville residents are concerned over the effects on Route 107, a two-lane road that grinds to a standstill during rush hour. Canon is studying the traffic problem and has hired Walter Dunn of Dunn Engineering Associates to examine the situation. Although the study is in the preliminary stages, Mr. Dunn said, "There are some problems at existing traffic flows during the A.M. and P.M. hours."
He said additional lanes might be needed near the intersection of Glen Cove Road and Northern Boulevard.
Another step may be to stagger employees' work hours.
 
May Be Prime Source for Future
 The heavy traffic could also affect aquifers. According to the bicounty planning coordinator of the Long Island Planning Board, Edith Tannenbaum, the property is in a ground-water protection area.
"It is a portion of the deep-recharge area, a relatively undeveloped portion in comparison with the rest of Nassau County," she said. "The water in this area has been rated good to excellent and could be the prime source for the future of Long Island."
Ms. Tannenbaum said the residues from a large number of cars could create an impermeable surface, making it difficult for rain water to filter into the ground.
Mr. Koppelman said that he had been a main researcher in studying aquifers on the Island and that the Canon site would not create a problem, because "it isn't even in the area I am most concerned with."
To complicate the issue, a lake that is a water-recharge basin is on the property. The county bought it from New York Tech for $150,000. Storm water goes through the soil, where it is purified, and then into the aquifers, said a spokesman for the county, Ken Cyner. The lake covers two to three acres, not including a 50-foot easement.
The de Seversky parcel was rezoned in the winter from two-acre residential to five-acre residential classification after a study by Fredrich P. Clark Associates, a planning and consulting firm in Rye, had recommended that all large vacant tracts in the village be rezoned to higher categories.
The Village of Brookville commissioned the $58,500 study.
"The reason for the rezoning is twofold," Mayor Galgano said. "One, open-space preservation, and the second, to recognize the aquifer located under the North Shore's green belt."
Al Bianco of Brookville, a developer who owns 58 acres of the property catercorner to the de Seversky parcel on Northern Boulevard, stood up at the meeting last month to back the Canon proposal. He drew a parallel between Canon and the Villa Banfi headquarters in Old Brookville.
"The two are totally different," said Mayor F. Reed Anthony of Old Brookville.
Villa Banfi is operating under a special-use permit limiting the wine-and-spirits importer to 56 employees at the site at any time. Banfi restored an unused mansion, replanted the property and added a modern wing for its marketing division. It also uses 75 acres to produce Old Brookville Chardonnay, the only Long Island wine produced in Nassau County.
 
'Elegant New Level of Nimbyism'
 Since the Long Island Association has come out in support of Canon, "we have had some reaction to our support for the proposal in an elegant new level of Nimbyism," for the not-in-my-backyard reaction, Mr. Larocca said, explaining that most of the opposition has been from developers who had aggressively developed other areas of the Island but did not want additional building in their own neighborhoods.
Mr. Dugan of Brookville said: "The North Shore is the only place preserved for residential housing. Once we allow one commercial entity, there's no stopping it. Soon every 10-acre plot would possibly be a commercial site, and once corporations see the money saved by purchasing residentially zoned property as opposed to far more expensive commercial property, we'll have developers running here looking for property."
"It happened in Brooklyn and now in Little Neck and even Great Neck, along Northern Boulevard," the founder of the Cedar Swamp Historical Society, John Peterkin, said. "Who's to say that by the year 2000 that doesn't happen here?"
Mayor Galgano and the village trustees have not indicated their feelings on the Canon plan other than to say, "It is worthy of exploration." Mr. Galgano sent a letter to all residents summarizing the last meeting and saying that Canon and New York Tech had requested that no action be taken for the time being, allowing them to present a more cohesive plan to the board and residents.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
For the Seville Fair, the Old Geodesic Dome Trick

BYLINE: By Thomas S. Hines; Thomas S. Hines teaches cultural and architectural history at the University of California at Los Angeles.

 BODY:
In the best of all possible worlds, the United States pavilion at Expo '92 in Seville would be an elegant and sophisticated building. It would be a graceful bow from the leading nation that rose from the lands Columbus discovered when he set sail from Palos de la Frontera 500 years ago. But that building is not going to appear. A design that met those requirements has been scrapped in favor of two tired geodesic domes that have been retrieved from a Government warehouse and plunked down on the United States site. Writing about it in The Wall Street Journal, the American reporter Amy Gamerman said: "Expo watchers are laughing up their sleeves at the cheapo hybrid pavilion, dubbing it 'Twin Peaks.' It will look especially mingy on the enormous U.S. site."
 While Spain will hold center stage as host of the world's fair, beginning next April, the United States is the designated guest of honor. It would seem that the country would have seized the moment. Yet all signs point to a potential national embarrassment, with plans for America's presentation of itself botched and compromised by bureaucratic bungling and a lack of vision. 
 Plans for the American Pavilion at Seville '92 began with appropriately ambitious visions. President Reagan wrote to King Juan Carlos promising a strong American presence. On Nov. 28, 1989, President Bush confirmed this commitment in a letter to Bruce Gelb, then director of the United States Information Agency, the body that oversees American participation in international fairs. "I am confident," the President wrote, "that when the nations of the world gather in Spain to mark the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage to the New World, the United States will have an exhibition that represents the energy and genius of our people."
 A panel appointed by the agency -- and composed largely of Government exhibition designers and administrators -- culled, from more than 70 entries, design proposals submitted by nine prestigious American firms: Arquitectonica; Davis, Brody & Associates; Holt Hinshaw Pfau Jones; Barton Myers Associates; Cesar Pelli & Associates; Antoine Predock; Site; Venturi & Scott-Brown, and a team effort by Frank Gehry and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Ultimately, Gehry and S.O.M. joined Arquitectonica and Venturi & Scott-Brown to design a pavilion that would express American national and architectural diversity.
 Most of these imaginative, go-for-broke schemes came in well above the construction budget of $7.5 million. Even adding $10 million for inflation, designer and consulting fees, landscaping and exhibition installation costs, the sum was paltry compared to the $80 million projected for the Japanese pavilion and $40 million that financially pressed Britain had already appropriated.
 Although the panel ranked Antoine Predock's design first, Bruce Gelb chose the Barton Myers design, which was ranked second, as being "more feasible." Myers proposed a village of forms that could be contracted or expanded depending on the extent to which the budget could be augmented by increased appropriations or by contributions from the private sector. Roger Lewis, the only architect on the jury, says it was "thoughtfully conceived, thoroughly developed and slickly presented," with the "right mix of architectural potency, exhibition practicality and technical feasibility."
 Visitors would enter the pavilion through a wall of gently cascading water, symbolizing the Atlantic Ocean, and proceed via ramps and garden walks to the various exhibition spaces to "Rediscover America."
 In view of the national deficit, the recession and the limited exhibition budget, Myers had chosen not to go for a monumental structure on the scale of Edward Stone's 1958 pavilion at Brussels or even of Fuller's dome at Montreal. "Times had changed," Mr. Myers says. "That sort of statement wasn't necessary or appropriate. Here we could represent America in another way. Instead of being big and bombastic, our design tried to be gracious and elegant." Three large "sails" would allude to the caravels of Columbus and would track the sun as shading devices. At night, both the sails and the water wall would serve as a scrim upon which multiple images of "rediscovered America" would be projected. To ameliorate the 110-degree-plus temperatures, 50 outdoor cooling towers reminiscent of Don Judd sculptures would represent the 50 states.
 In 1989, the Bush Administration's budget for the 1990 fiscal year included money to build the pavilion. But for political reasons, the chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees -- Representative Neal Smith, Democrat of Iowa, and Senator Ernest Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina -- held up the request. The stumbling block was a disagreement with Mr. Gelb over his cost-cutting proposal to eliminate the Lao, Slovene and Uzbek languages from Voice of America broadcasts. Until Mr. Gelb relented and restored the languages, the American pavilion was held hostage.
 On Feb. 20, 1990, Senator Hollings wrote to Mr. Gelb that he should "be advised that Seville has no priority with me. Our highest priority has to be getting the agency's basic funding stabilized and not worrying about fairs." A week earlier, The New York Times had quoted Representative Smith as saying: "I don't have anything against world's fairs, but I don't think the Federal Government should be paying for them."
 After the loss of a crucial year that should have been spent in construction, Myers's $7.5 million construction estimate had risen, after spiraling inflation and dollar-peseta fluctuations, to $17,220,000, according to Allen Bryant, the Navy project manager, with overall costs estimated at $24,600,000. Congress belatedly appropriated $13 million, a fraction of the U.S.I.A.'s total expenditures of $926 million for the same fiscal year. When contractors' bids for the Myers design came in, the United States ranked 38th in total pavilion costs among the approximately 100 countries participating. In the Americas, Canada seemed to have no trouble raising adequate funds; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was also moving ahead with an impressive pavilion, as were most of the Latin American countries. At least some of Columbus's discovered lands would be adequately represented.
 In January, Frederick Bush, the newly appointed American Commissioner-General for Expo '92, and an experienced fund raiser for George Bush's Presidential campaign, concluded that additional funds were not forthcoming and decided suddenly to abandon the Myers proposal. To fill the vacuum, he retrieved from agency warehouses two geodesic domes that the U.S.I.A. had been using since the 1970's for small trade fairs. At this point Barry Howard, one of the two exhibition designers, resigned in protest. A disappointed Barton Myers stayed on reluctantly as consultant to the U.S.I.A., his name no longer attached to the remnants of his original design. Pale vestiges of his water wall and shade sails survived, though in different sizes and locations and without the elegant village of structures that gave them meaning.
When the ax fell on his pavilion design, Mr. Myers's protestations went unheeded. No one on the design team was able to get through to President Bush, then preoccupied with the gulf war. At this point, Frederick Bush also shifted ground philosophically. "We decided that the architecture is really not the reason people are coming to Expo," he said in May. "We're not there to build a monument to the architect; we're there to build U.S. tourism." It is difficult to understand Mr. Bush's implicit argument that good architecture and tourism are incompatible.
 How the United States pavilion at Expo '92 will turn out is a matter of conjecture. Frederick Bush is optimistic about finishing the task on time and under budget. The geodesic frames, he says, will be reclad. The exhibits, moreover, are being paid for entirely from corporate coffers, with no Federal monies expended on "content." The pavilion centerpiece will be a film by General Motors, which Mr. Bush insists will be a "wonderful surprise." Once again we are faced with the question of whether what is good for General Motors is good for the country. Those who pay the bills do get to tell the story, and while that story may be skillfully presented, it will still be GM's vision of America.
 It is a lost opportunity for the country and for architecture.

HEADLINE: New Mortgage Rules Help New Buyers

BYLINE: By JUDY GLASS

 BODY:
THE softening real-estate market and low-interest mortgages are making it easier for first-time buyers to buy houses on the Island.
"Smaller starter houses are what's moving," the chairwoman of the Affordable Housing Committee at the Long Island Board of Realtors, Barbara Roberts. Ms. Roberts is also a broker at the John Flynn Realty Corporation in Kings Park. 
 Almost 2,000 State of New York Mortgage Agency loans at a fixed rate of 8.4 percent loans have been written in the last year. Until last year the mortgages, which call for 5 percent down payments, were of little use on the Island because the caps on house prices and buyers' incomes were too low for the market, Miss Roberts said. Last year the state raised the limits.
Suffolk County has led the state, receiving 1,413 state loans. Nassau County is third, with 527.
The loans are intended is to assist low- and moderate-income families and help economically depressed areas.
"Sonyma does a huge amount of business in Suffolk County because we have aggressive lenders there, and the county has been very aggressive about affordable housing," said Toni Langkau, director of marketing and community development for the mortgage agency.
The price limit for resales in Nassau and Suffolk is $148,900. For a new single-family house the cap is $176,200.
 
More Than 19,000 Listings
 If a house is in a "target area" that the Federal and state governments have designated for extra assistance, the maximum is $182,000 for an existing house and $201,300 for a new house.
"The drop in real-estate prices during the recession has built the inventory of houses that qualify," Miss Roberts said. Her board held two housing fairs in the spring.
The Multiple Listing Service has 7,351 houses, co-ops and condos for sale at less than $150,000 and 12,562 for less than $160,000.
An abode, which can also be a co-op, condo or mobile home, has to be a full-time residence in the state and meet rules on size and condition.
A single person or couple buying for the first time is defined as not having had an ownership interest in a primary residence for the three years before the mortgage. The buyer cannot earn more than $54,500 a year if the house is in a nontarget area or more than $65,400 if the house is in a target area.
A buyer has to have a steady job, a good credit background, a 5 percent down payment, approximately 7 percent of the purchase price for closing costs and private mortgage insurance, if the down payment is less than 20 percent of the price.
The limits are higher for the prices on multiple-family houses and larger families' incomes.
Most loans are to couples and families buying single-family houses, Miss Roberts said.
Lenders want to give loans to people who have the willingness and ability to pay them off, said Karen Klee, president of the Long Island Association of Professional Mortgage Women and operations manager of the Sears Mortgage Company in Melville.
The lenders' market, including savings and loan institutions, banks and private lenders, is very competitive on Long Island, Miss Klee said.
"Buyers who cannot qualify for a Sonyma should shop around," she said. Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Administration mortgages are at 9.5 percent.
Sears, like all Sonyma lenders, will help determine prospective buyers' qualifications.
Most lenders, including Sonyma, use a "28-36 guideline" to measure the ability to buy a house, Miss Klee said. A family's monthly housing expenses, which include principal, interest, insurance and taxes, should not exceed 28 percent of the gross monthly income. Other debts like credit cards, car loans and school loans should not exceed 36 percent of the gross monthly income.
 
'In Better Correlation'
 "Since 1987 Sonyma has rejected only 6 percent of the files submitted for review, a process that takes place after the contract has been signed," said Jonn N. Stano, vice president and director of the single-family program for the State of New York Mortgage Agency.
Purchase prices and income levels, which vary across the state, "are in better correlation on Long Island" than in the area of New York City, Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties, he said, adding that there were few low-priced houses in those areas.
The state established Mr. Stano's agency in 1970. The Federal Home Loan Bank Boards set the limits on incomes and prices because the low-interest mortgages are financed through the tax-exempt bonds.
"High taxes are a major problem on Long Island," said Maria Ferrer, owner of Realty World-Maria Ferrer Inc. in East Islip, which has placed about 30 state mortgages in the last three years. "Sonyma mortgages are for the needy. But people who meet the income limits still may not be able to afford the monthly costs."
Recently she said a young couple with a combined income of $65,000 who had $30,000 for a down payment had to forgo a $149,000 house in Islip because the taxes were $5,100 a year.
Anne Colleran, an insurance supervisor at Royal Insurance in Bohemia, bought a three-bedroom house in a target area of Central Islip for $110,000 with a state mortgage that Miss Ferrer helped obtain.
 
On $45,000-a-Year Salary
 "I was really scared about the prospect of buying a house by myself," Ms. Colleran said. "But I was also tired of paying Uncle Sam high taxes on my $45,000-a-year salary while I was renting."
She put down $9,000, even though 5 percent was required. The closing costs, including bank points, were $6,500. With taxes of $2,700, her monthly payments are $1,065. The process took 60 days.
"So many brokers are afraid that the Sonyma process takes too long," Miss Ferrer said. "But it doesn't if you have a well-constructed package."

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT Q&A: JERRY FRANKLIN;
Mandates Evolve for Public Television

BYLINE: By VALERIE CRUICE

 BODY:
WHEN Jerry Franklin became president and chief executive officer of Connecticut Public Broadcasting six years ago, he said, he found a "non-aggressive station." Worse, CPTV was commonly called "sleepy TV" by the public, and had a market penetration of only 30 percent of the state's population. Not only did the station have an identity crisis, in some areas of the state it was also competing with WGBH of Boston and WNET of New York.
The Connecticut Public Broadcasting system consists of Channel 24 in Hartford, Channel 49 in Fairfield County, Channel 53 in Norwich, Channel 65 in New Haven and Channel 12 in Waterbury as well as FM radio stations in Middlefield, Norwich and Stamford. The CPTV guide, which appears in Connecticut Magazine, is produced by the station, as is its own Applause Guide. A profit-making production company called the Corporate Video Center is a subsidiary in Stamford. Mr. Franklin has turned things around for Connecticut Public Broadcasting. Now, 60 percent of the state's viewers tune in to their home station, according to Nielsen surveys. 
 A new complex for Channel 49, in the Stamford Center for the Arts, is due to begin operations this fall. And in the past four years CPTV has been nominated more than 30 times for regional Emmy awards and has won 11 for local documentaries.
Since CPTV is dependent on private and corporate donations as well as being a recipient of substantial state funds -- and all these sources have had to decrease their support with the recession -- Mr. Franklin has had to change the way he does business, he said.
From his office in the CPTV studios in Hartford, Mr. Franklin, who is 43 years old, answered some questions about the problems facing the state's public television stations. Here are some excerpts from the conversation.
Q. When did CPTV begin to feel the adverse effects of the economy?
A. We started sweating bullets two and a half years ago. We started this recession earlier. I have eliminated 40 positions during that two-and-a-half-year period. We have 100 employees now. We think we are the bottom of the curve. We see signs of improvement in all areas except the state.
Q. What do you hope to receive from the state?
A. We were supposed to get $1.2 million; that was in the Governor's budget. That's been reduced to a million. Our total budget is $16 million. It was a painful cut. We don't have any margins or cash reserves.
Q. What would happen if the $1 million grant were to be eliminated?
A. I could not cut $1 million out of this budget and operate. We'd have to sign off some of our stations. In December, if funding doesn't deteriorate further, we will sign on a third radio station. We need $80,000 to activate it.
Q. How have individual and corporate contributions been affected?
A. The number of memberships is leveling off, but we're getting more money from existing members. Our membership support is about $350,000 below last year. Corporate support is flat. This year we are about $300,000 below last year in corporate support.
Q. How has this affected CPTV's programming?
A. We're redefining. We'll do about 50 percent less of local documentaries this year. The state cutback is one reason. Arts programming will be even less. Companies are very willing to do environment and education, but arts programming has been a very tough sell. In the old days I could start spending against a contract. Now I have to have the cash.
Q. What part does the Corporate Video Center play in CPTV's overall financial picture?
A. This is a wholly-owned, for-profit subsidiary. The parent company is Connecticut Broadcasting Inc. The for-profit company exists for one reason: to generate a profit. Those profits are transferred, usually on a quarterly basis, to the parent company. I give Reagan credit for that. We provide videos for Fortune 500 companies, training films, videos for annual meetings. That's a good business for us. It's a little soft this year. We're under budget. This year the for-profit subsidiary will contribute about $300,000.
Q. What does the future hold in terms of programming?
A. We don't think for a moment that we will become the 'GBH or 'NET of Connecticut. But we believe that national programming is a part of who we are. For example, we're totally in synch with the new PBS, if you take a look in terms of where PBS is going with children's programming. Children's programming is one of our mandates. We had said four years ago that we wanted to get into producing programs for children.
"Barney," a life-sized purple dinosaur, already existed in the home video market. CPTV was awarded a $2.25 million grant by PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to produce a 30-part series for preschoolers. We're going into production this month. Barney will premiere in April 1992 on all PBS stations. It has the potential of being the biggest children's program since "Sesame Street."
Q. Do CPTV's Connecticut documentaries air nationally?
A. We say that we are a national institution. We take part of Connecticut and share it with the nation. We did that last year with "Lighthouses of New England," "The Nautilus" and "Swim Across the Sound." Seven to eight projects air nationally each year.
Q. Besides children's programming, what else is important to CPTV?
A. The other area of importance to us is science programming. The citizens of Connecticut think of CPTV as their science-environmental-nature station. We're riding down the science rail.
We have the most popular science series on PBS -- "Scientific American Frontiers." We get $2 million from GTE to do those shows. It's a prime-time PBS series. We're more excited by the fact that 20 million students used that in their classrooms last year.
No one has that kind of classroom penetration. We want two or three others like that -- smart programs.
Q. What does your new partnership with the National Science Foundation involve?
A. We're going to try to use television to persuade parents that there is a desperate need for better ways to teach science and math in the classroom. For example, we will visit a high school in Bridgeport, go into a science class and show you the less-than-state-of-the-art laboratories and antiquated teaching facilities. Then we'll go across the street to a high-tech, engineering-based, computer-based, laser-equipment-type company to show you the kind of students this company needs. It's going to be a yearlong series of vignettes, two- to four-minute pieces that will run throughout our schedule.
Q. Has CPTV been controversial?
A. We like to influence public opinion: it's our mission. We did about 35 different documentaries on Connecticut issues. One of them was called "Bloodsports?" We wanted to look at the issue of the rights of hunters and the animal-rights activists. To use a cliche, we had both groups mad at us, so I guess it was balanced. In the McNeil-Lehrer tradition we covered all sides of the issue.
We did "Connecticut's Drug Web"; that was controversial, as was "The Other Connecticut," which showed the two sides of Connecticut, the rich and the poor. That turned some heads. We put them smack in the middle of prime time, to make people squirm. We did a show on "children killing children." That had a positive impact on the legislature. There's a law on the books that parents are responsible for their kids' actions. We did the same thing on the environment. The E.P.A. uses our documentaries.

The Welcome Mat's Out for 'Granny Flats'

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN

DATELINE: RIVERSIDE, CALIF.

 BODY:
AMONG the fruits of a special zoning law in this desert community 70 miles east of Los Angeles is an 800-square-foot apartment in the backyard of Anthony and Darla Riggio, which the couple built last year as a home for Mr. Riggio's retirement-age parents.
Under Riverside's so-called "Granny Flats" ordinance, which encourages the construction of apartments on the lots of existing single-family homes, the Riggios applied for and received a permit to build the unit. Mr. Riggio, a former roofer who drives a delivery route, spent five months and $40,000 building the free-standing apartment with the help of friends and contractors. 
 Set 40 feet behind the existing house, the new apartment allows the elder Riggios to remain independent. "They keep to themselves, and they are farther away from us than our neighbors," Mrs. Riggio said.
Riverside is unusual among American cities for the creation of zoning, enacted in 1983, that allows accessory apartments, which are self-contained units with separate entrances and kitchens.
Yet even in California, where state law protects such apartments from being outlawed by local governments, the practice remains unpopular in many communities, and restrictions are common.
Some homeowners see such apartments as a source of extra income or an alternative to old-age homes for aging relatives. They may also represent a way to adapt existing housing to the changing nature of American households, said Tom Cook, deputy director of the California Department of Housing and Community Development in Sacramento.
A 1950's-style one-family home that formerly housed two parents and three children may now be "divided among a single mother, her child and an elderly person," he said.
Many urban planners consider rental units in homes a valuable resource in a nation with a shrinking amount of land to house a growing population. A report released last June by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, "Not in My Backyard: Removing Barriers to Affordable Housing" called accessory apartments "an easily attainable and relatively inexpensive" strategy for increasing the amount of affordable housing.
Patrick Hare, a planning consultant in Washington, contends that accessory apartments could increase the stock of rental housing nationally by 14 percent if the units were legal everywhere. Since the units typically rent for below-market rates, Mr. Hare said he considers accessory apartments a potential source of affordable housing.
Yet both political and practical problems cast shadows on the future of accessory apartments.
Despite the economic and social benefits that planners like Mr. Hare perceive in accessory apartments, such units are often political hot potatoes. Neighborhood residents often think of the units as adding both to the density and the traffic of their neighborhoods, and fear a decline in property values.
When the Riggios held a routine public hearing in the course of applying for a special permit to build their apartment, a dissenting neighbor "said we wanted to make the neighborhood into a ghetto, like East L.A.," Mrs. Riggio recalled.
While Mr. Hare said no evidence exists that accessory apartments harm property values, many communities in California continue to discourage such units, even if communities cannnot ban them outright.
Eliza Shefler, a resident of Albany, a small town directly north of Berkeley, has repeatedly tried and failed to legalize an existing 400-square-foot rental apartment behind her house.
Ms. Shefler, a masseuse and musician, has found herself a reluctant lightning rod in a land-use furor. Earlier this year, the City Council threw out an earlier decision by the Planning Commission approving the apartment. Ms. Shefler tried again, this time describing the unit as an "affordable" housing unit and citing a state law forbidding cities from turning down affordable projects, if local housing codes do not comply with state law.
Albany's housing codes indeed do not comply with California law, but city officials nonetheless turned away Ms. Shefler's challenge, citing a possible "negative impact on public health and safety" from increased on-street parking.
"I have not given up," Ms. Shefler saId, "but they are really giving me a hard time."
Most typical are parking requirements that are difficult or impossible to comply with, like those in Albany, which require two off-street parking spaces for every dwelling -- meaning that homeowners like Ms. Shefler must find space for four off-street spaces, two spaces for herself and two for her tenant.
Even Riverside's "Granny Flat" ordinance is restrictive: the units are limited to people aged 60 and older and homeowners must pay a nonrefundable filing fee of $2,500 for a permit.
Communities must do more to promote accessory apartments beyond mere legalization, Mr. Hare, the planning consultant, said. Homeowners who are otherwise willing to build the units may find themselves with little information or support about the rental marketplace or how to price the unit. Homeowners, he said, "need someone who will say, 'here is how you get financing, here is where you can go to get a tenant.' "
But John Trauth, executive director of the Development Fund, a nonprofit housing research group in San Francisco, called Mr. Hare's marketing notion "naive."
Mr. Trauth cited his own experience in conducting a marketing program to sell homeowners on the idea of "granny flats."
Called the Double Unit Opportunity Program, it offered architectural assistance and feasibility studies to homeowners in four Northern California counties and in the city of Berkeley.
But Mr. Trauth said the results were mixed. Many homeowners who started out wanting to build accessory units later lost heart when they became aware of the time, expense and trouble involved. Mr. Trauth acknowledged that such units "are quite difficult to do." He was able to help in the creation of only 42 out of a goal of 100.
"As a program to create a lot of affordable housing," he said, "this was not the one."
For homeowners less handy than Mr. Riggio, who was able to build his accessory apartment largely by himself, an easier route may be new homes already equipped with rental units.
The concept is being tested in the 1,000-acre Laguna West subdivision in Sacramento County, 11 miles south of the state capital. A newly crafted zoning code allows granny flats atop detached garages.
"We have nothing to lose by offering buyers something that makes a lot of sense," said Phil Angelides, president of River West Developments of Sacramento, which plans to sell land to developers for a maximum of 3,370 one-family homes and apartments.
Although no "granny flats" have yet been built in the subdivision, Mr. Angelides said 25 percent of potential buyers have expressed interest in buying homes with separate apartments.
Moreover, buyers who now say no to accessory apartments can build them in the future. "If they don't want 'granny flats' in 1991," Mr. Angelides said of buyers, "they'll want them in the year 2000, when their parents are 70."

HEADLINE: Focus: Riverside, Calif.;
The Welcome Mat's Out for 'Granny Flats'

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN

DATELINE: RIVERSIDE, CALIF.

 BODY:
AMONG the fruits of a special zoning law in this desert community 70 miles east of Los Angeles is an 800-square-foot apartment in the backyard of Anthony and Darla Riggio, which the couple built last year as a home for Mr. Riggio's retirement-age parents.
Under Riverside's so-called "Granny Flats" ordinance, which encourages the construction of apartments on the lots of existing single-family homes, the Riggios applied for and received a permit to build the unit. Mr. Riggio, a former roofer who drives a delivery route, spent five months and $40,000 building the free-standing apartment with the help of friends and contractors. 
 Set 40 feet behind the existing house, the new apartment allows the elder Riggios to remain independent. "They keep to themselves, and they are farther away from us than our neighbors," Mrs. Riggio said.
Riverside is unusual among American cities for the creation of zoning, enacted in 1983, that allows accessory apartments, which are self-contained units with separate entrances and kitchens.
Yet even in California, where state law protects such apartments from being outlawed by local governments, the practice remains unpopular in many communities, and restrictions are common.
Some homeowners see such apartments as a source of extra income or an alternative to old-age homes for aging relatives. They may also represent a way to adapt existing housing to the changing nature of American households, said Tom Cook, deputy director of the California Department of Housing and Community Development in Sacramento.
A 1950's-style one-family home that formerly housed two parents and three children may now be "divided among a single mother, her child and an elderly person," he said.
Many urban planners consider rental units in homes a valuable resource in a nation with a shrinking amount of land to house a growing population. A report released last June by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, "Not in My Backyard: Removing Barriers to Affordable Housing" called accessory apartments "an easily attainable and relatively inexpensive" strategy for increasing the amount of affordable housing.
Patrick Hare, a planning consultant in Washington, contends that accessory apartments could increase the stock of rental housing nationally by 14 percent if the units were legal everywhere. Since the units typically rent for below-market rates, Mr. Hare said he considers accessory apartments a potential source of affordable housing.
Yet both political and practical problems cast shadows on the future of accessory apartments.
Despite the economic and social benefits that planners like Mr. Hare perceive in accessory apartments, such units are often political hot potatoes. Neighborhood residents often think of the units as adding both to the density and the traffic of their neighborhoods, and fear a decline in property values.
When the Riggios held a routine public hearing in the course of applying for a special permit to build their apartment, a dissenting neighbor "said we wanted to make the neighborhood into a ghetto, like East L.A.," Mrs. Riggio recalled.
While Mr. Hare said no evidence exists that accessory apartments harm property values, many communities in California continue to discourage such units, even if communities cannnot ban them outright.
ELIZA SHEFLER, a resident of Albany, a small town directly north of Berkeley, has repeatedly tried and failed to legalize an existing 400-square-foot rental apartment behind her house.
Ms. Shefler, a masseuse and musician, has found herself a reluctant lightning rod in a land-use furor. Earlier this year, the City Council threw out an earlier decision by the Planning Commission approving the apartment. Ms. Shefler tried again, this time describing the unit as an "affordable" housing unit and citing a state law forbidding cities from turning down affordable projects, if local housing codes do not comply with state law.
Albany's housing codes indeed do not comply with California law, but city officials nonetheless turned away Ms. Shefler's challenge, citing a possible "negative impact on public health and safety" from increased on-street parking.
"I have not given up," Ms. Shefler saId, "but they are really giving me a hard time."
Most typical are parking requirements that are difficult or impossible to comply with, like those in Albany, which require two off-street parking spaces for every dwelling -- meaning that homeowners like Ms. Shefler must find space for four off-street spaces, two spaces for herself and two for her tenant.
Even Riverside's "Granny Flat" ordinance is restrictive: the units are limited to people aged 60 and older and homeowners must pay a nonrefundable filing fee of $2,500 for a permit.
Communities must do more to promote accessory apartments beyond mere legalization, Mr. Hare, the planning consultant, said. Homeowners who are otherwise willing to build the units may find themselves with little information or support about the rental marketplace or how to price the unit. Homeowners, he said, "need someone who will say, 'here is how you get financing, here is where you can go to get a tenant.' "
But John Trauth, executive director of the Development Fund, a nonprofit housing research group in San Francisco, called Mr. Hare's marketing notion "naive."
Mr. Trauth cited his own experience in conducting a marketing program to sell homeowners on the idea of "granny flats."
Called the Double Unit Opportunity Program, it offered architectural assistance and feasibility studies to homeowners in four Northern California counties and in the city of Berkeley.
But Mr. Trauth said the results were mixed. Many homeowners who started out wanting to build accessory units later lost heart when they became aware of the time, expense and trouble involved. Mr. Trauth acknowledged that such units "are quite difficult to do." He was able to help in the creation of only 42 out of a goal of 100.
"As a program to create a lot of affordable housing," he said, "this was not the one."
FOR homeowners less handy than Mr. Riggio, who was able to build his accessory apartment largely by himself, an easier route may be new homes already equipped with rental units.
The concept is being tested in the 1,000-acre Laguna West subdivision in Sacramento County, 11 miles south of the state capital. A newly crafted zoning code allows granny flats atop detached garages.
"We have nothing to lose by offering buyers something that makes a lot of sense," said Phil Angelides, president of River West Developments of Sacramento, which plans to sell land to developers for a maximum of 3,370 one-family homes and apartments.
Although no "granny flats" have yet been built in the subdivision, Mr. Angelides said 25 percent of potential buyers have expressed interest in buying homes with separate apartments.
Moreover, buyers who now say no to accessory apartments can build them in the future. "If they don't want 'granny flats' in 1991," Mr. Angelides said of buyers, "they'll want them in the year 2000, when their parents are 70."

HEADLINE: The Democrats Get Their Chance

BYLINE: By Stephen Sestanovich; Stephen Sestanovich is director of Soviet and East European studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Soviet Union came out of this week's coup in the uncertain state that follows peaceful revolution: The institutions of the old order were discredited, but still standing. The insurgents enjoyed immense moral authority, but did not know who would follow their orders.
This ambiguity could not last. The gentlemanly coalition between Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin that many experts -- and President Bush himself -- believed would be the best basis for reform began to dissolve almost immediately. 
 Cooperation between the two leaders would, of course, have matched the immediate post-revolutionary pattern of most of Eastern Europe after 1989. In Poland, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski remained president for more than a year after he agreed to the formation of a Solidarity cabinet. For months after the Berlin wall came down, East Germany had a coalition Government under a Communist prime minister. Even President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia picked a Communist prime minister.
The slow change-over in Eastern Europe reflected the near-total passivity with which the old order yielded to the democratic revolution. The army and the police had largely stayed indoors. Leaving the machinery of government temporarily in place, to be slowly remade, seemed safe enough. It was in any case hard to replace an entire bureaucracy overnight.
Meanwhile the Communist Party was left to wither slowly, until elections -- held within six months in almost every country of Eastern Europe -- swept it away.
Mr. Gorbachev would have been lucky to be offered a partnership on the Eastern European model: some inelegant combination of General Jaruzelski and Gregor Gysi, the man who became leader of the East German Communist Party when no one else would take the job.
But the role of Communist junior partner was certain to be more precarious than in Eastern Europe, and Mr. Gorbachev made matters worse by wanting for more. Gregor Gysi's clothes look painfully small to the father of perestroika.
The first problem was the remaking of the Soviet state. Nowhere in Eastern Europe was there anything like this week's coup. We may laugh at the plotters for their bumbling, but let us recall who they were: the leaders of every single major institution of the Soviet state, without exception. Those who turned the coup back, leaders and crowds alike, inevitably demanded that these institutions be dismantled.
Mr. Gorbachev, by contrast, tried to focus attention on personnel -- rooting out those who took part in or supported the coup, instead of breaking the system they represented. There was the same evasiveness in his initial statements that no time should be lost in returning to the business of reform.
From the moment the junta fell, Boris Yeltsin pursued a different agenda. He wanted extensive formal checks on the military and the K.G.B., a renegotiation of the union treaty to win new rights for the republics and other measures that cut the central Soviet bureaucracy down to size. Many of these steps were taken in the usual manner of a victorious revolutionary leader -- by decree. If Mr. Yeltsin envisioned a partnership with Mr. Gorbachev, its prime purpose was to destroy his partner's power base.
A far more dangerous problem for Mr. Gorbachev was the surge of anti-Communist anger. The party stayed behind the scenes during the coup, but Mr. Yeltsin immediately labeled it one of the principal villains. He declared it "must be removed from power" and clearly meant it. Once he suspended the Communist Party of the Russian republic, the unionwide party was clearly going to be next.
For Mr. Gorbachev, even resigning from his post as party leader may now be inadequate. It will not be forgotten that in his first statements after being released he took exactly the same line he had taken at the last meeting of the Central Committee in July: that is, his goal was to purify the party by driving the hard-liners out. Mr. Gorbachev's outlandish claim that the party can be a living force for perestroika increased the risk that he would be caught in a political confrontation over its future. The crowds in the street may soon turn their wrath not just on the party, but on him.
For Mr. Yeltsin, much more is at stake than personal rivalry (although he plainly enjoys Mr. Gorbachev's comeuppance). He has to fashion a political program that will weather the hard economic times ahead. He knows that in Eastern Europe only one democratic government has fallen since 1989 -- the Solidarity cabinet formed by Tadeusz Mazowiecki two years ago this month. Having carried out a convulsive economic reform, Mr. Mazowiecki was gravely weakened by the charge that too many Communists had been kept on, enriching themselves in the course of privatization. (Even Western aid did not help him.)
Mr. Yeltsin has to do what Mr. Mazowiecki proved unable to do -- sustain popular belief that, despite hardship, a real revolution has taken place. He will be helped by the fact that he has the commanding style of Lech Walesa, the man who brought Mr. Mazowiecki down. But, beyond style, he will be helped most by the substance of Mr. Walesa's radical anti-Communist message. Only this provides the legitimacy that can carry a new regime forward.
The failure of this week's coup will at last put an end to discussion, by both Soviet and Western analysts, of the "Pinochet model." This was the comparison between the Soviet Union and other states, like Chile or South Korea, that made a breakthrough to democracy after a long period of military rule. Exponents of this neo-authoritarian fantasy insisted that only a very repressive Soviet regime could deal with the social tensions created by rapid marketization. A government of liberal reformers would be unable to hold the country together.
The coup exposed a huge problem with the Pinochet scheme: The only institutions able to enforce it had no interest in liberal results. Yet it is still unclear whether the other half of the neo-authoritarian argument is right. Can a democratic government run the Soviet Union where dictatorship failed? In rallying the people, Boris Yeltsin and his allies have given the most hopeful imaginable answer. They have shown that in a revolution -- and, what is now even more important, in its aftermath -- force is not the only form of power.

THREE BLIND MICE
How the Networks Lost Their Way.
By Ken Auletta.
656 pp. New York:
Random House.
$25.  
 Once upon a time, there was an American Century. Bread was white, menace was red, computers were I.B.M., cars were General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, and television was CBS, NBC and ABC. But the world has been rewired, and the mighty, after trumpeting great plans, are in decline. At the networks, as elsewhere, capitalism continues its mission of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter called "creative destruction." In "Three Blind Mice," Ken Auletta aims to take us behind the scenes and show us just how creative -- and hilarious and wasteful -- are the means of destruction and self-destruction.
By 1984, when Mr. Auletta's story begins, jaded network audiences were already slipping away to local and cable competitors, and so, therefore, were advertisers' dollars. In 1976, 92 percent of households watching television in prime time were tuned to one of the networks, Mr. Auletta reports; by 1984, that figure had shrunk to 75 percent. (In 1991, it hovers around 60 percent.) The old titans -- William S. Paley at CBS and Leonard Goldenson at ABC -- were fading, and new cable competitors were looming on the horizon. The more homes acquired cable and videocassette recorders, the more network profits shrank.
Enter America's most impressive innovation of the 1980's: Wall Street ingenuity. The old guard at the networks knew it was only a matter of time before corporate raiders put them in play. CBS, ABC and NBC's proprietor, RCA, were vulnerable, their stocks believed to be undervalued. Investors like Donald Trump and T. Boone Pickens were trading large blocs of RCA stock. Ted Turner, Ivan Boesky and even Jesse Helms -- who in 1985 aided a group of conservative investors in an effort to buy a controlling interest -- cast their eyes on what CBS people had long called "Mr. Paley's candy store." Each network wanted a big protector -- an investor with plenty of cash. But any protector big enough to keep predators at bay was also big enough to gobble up the company itself.
So it was that in the course of 1985 and 1986, the Big Three television networks were bought out -- ABC by Capital Cities, a chain of television and radio stations; CBS by the billionaire Laurence A. Tisch and his brother, Preston Robert, who had made money in hotels, theaters, oil tankers and clever trading; NBC (and the rest of RCA) by General Electric. The new proprietors came in bent on controlling costs. Eventually they ended up doing what came naturally to the networks: throwing money at the Hollywood studios or the National Football League to produce more hit programs.
Laurence Tisch, whom the aging William Paley perhaps inadvertently called "Larry Kitsch" at a 1987 meeting, proved himself a particular piker. For openers he closed down CBS's high-tech lab and its minority-advancement program, along with the bargain store that served employees and two of the five kitchens that served nine private dining rooms. Mr. Tisch even griped about the cost of a bagel at the Beverly Hills Hotel. He conducted CBS meetings with an eye on the Financial News Network's stock quotations. He wielded what looked to him like a scalpel and looked to the network's news division like an ax. Within a few years, with CBS badly lagging in the ratings, Mr. Tisch overcompensated by wildly overbidding for sports.
For their part, Mr. Auletta reports, NBC's new General Electric bosses, while less colorful, also came on like newsbusters. "We will not operate this business with both belt and suspenders," read a memo from NBC's new president, Robert Wright. News would now be expected to make money. At ABC, meanwhile, the grand acquisitors from Cap Cities introduced themselves with party games, like passing out halves of 10-dollar bills to executives at a management retreat with instructions to find the matching half. The Cap Cities executives quickly learned that the light hand imposes layoffs more smoothly than the heavy.
Mr. Auletta, a columnist for The Daily News and the author of "Greed and Glory on Wall Street" and "The Underclass," had remarkable access to these goings-on. The principals let him wander the corridors, attend sales and affiliate meetings and brainstorming sessions about prime time schedules. He was a fly on the wall when Laurence Tisch paid court to the fading emperor of schlock, Aaron Spelling, father of "Charlie's Angels" and "The Love Boat" among other hits, and the two men exchanged awkward small talk.
Often the fly is on the right wall at the right time. Mr. Auletta catches the frantically upbeat style of the network sales force, the anger of the affiliates, the priceless moment when Mr. Spelling pitches to Brandon Tartikoff, at the time NBC's chief programmer, his one-sentence idea for a new series: "Student nurses in Dallas in the summer and the air conditioning doesn't work so they sweat a lot!" ("It's a 40 share!" said Mr. Tartikoff, using industry jargon for a hugely popular program. "Let's do it!") At such moments, Mr. Auletta approaches the Balzacian satirical force that writing about television demands.
But over all, "Three Blind Mice" lacks a sense of proportion. For scores of pages, the fly buzzes around the trivia of office politics. Like a sports announcer frightened of dead air, Mr. Auletta clogs his story with stray statistics. Details, pungent the first time, get repeated like twitches of the dying dinosaur's tail. We are flooded with ineffectual and inept atmospherics: the wife of Lawrence Grossman, the head of NBC news, had "dark eyes" that "moved about like sentries"; General Electric's chairman and chief executive officer, Jack Welch, had "eyes like pale blue moons in a clear sky." It isn't enough that the author sets up a conflict -- between Thomas Wyman, the chairman of CBS, and Laurence Tisch, the white knight turned takeover artist, or between Mr. Grossman and NBC's new corporate owners; he must take the reader through every telephone conversation in which the principals diagnose the last meeting, every meeting preparing the next meeting. When he does build up suspense, he often enough explodes it with a little-did-they-know flash-forward.
The result often reads like an interminable mini-series, as if length were truth. At the same time, there are important figures who get only the shortest of shrift -- like Roone Arledge, the president of ABC News and Sports, who laments, "I don't see anyone with a dream or vision or concept of what television ought to be." But although we learn the name of the restaurant where Mr. Arledge worries, Mr. Auletta fails to explore what that "dream or vision or concept" might be. By the same token, he fails to scrutinize the outgoing ABC president Fred Pierce's example of "vision": his kitchsy coverage of the Statue of Liberty bicentennial extravaganza.
Admirably, Mr. Auletta writes that he set out "to avoid . . . romanticiz[ing] the past in order to sharpen the portrait of current villains." But this habit of network chroniclers is hard to kick. Even his subtitle, "How the Networks Lost Their Way," implies that the networks were once on their way, when, in fact, their longtime success was largely a function of oligopoly.
The revered Mr. Paley, known for his "Tiffany network," programmed more like K Mart. (If he is to be congratulated for "All in the Family," mustn't he also be blamed for "The Beverly Hillbillies"?) The diversification (such as the purchase of the Yankees in 1966) that cost CBS many a pretty penny was Paley's doing. Laurence Tisch may be a technological naif who doesn't grasp the importance of innovation, but according to Sally Bedell Smith's recent biography, "In All His Glory," Paley's career is also littered with faulty technological decisions.
Indeed, Mr. Auletta repeatedly takes at face value what his informants tell him about the results of the network takeovers. An ABC producer complains: "There are whole parts of the world we don't cover because it's not cost-effective. We have not covered Haiti in the last four months." But in the glorious 1970's whole years went by when countries like Nicaragua and El Salvador, both in the throes of civil war, received not an instant of coverage on network news. One also wonders: Would CBS's programs be any different from what they are today if General Electric had bought CBS and the Tisch brothers had bought NBC? Did the networks differ significantly in their coverage of the the Persian Gulf war?
Arguably the answer to these questions is no, in which case the profiles and foibles of corporate bigwigs don't matter so much. General Electric's Jack Welch may be the Roman Catholic son of a featherbedding railroad worker, NBC's Bob Wright the Roman Catholic son of an engineer and Laurence Tisch the Jewish son of a clothing manufacturer from Bensonhurst, but their different origins seem to have produced similarly ham-handed management styles.
At his best, Mr. Auletta knows that character is not the whole of corporate destiny. He lucidly explains the structural forces operating on the industry -- notably the finances of network-affiliate relations and the networks' futile efforts to get the Federal Communications Commission to revise the rules that restrict them from sharing in the multibillion-dollar syndication market. And for all his piety before the cliche that "a mass medium creates a sense of community," he gives us ample reason to marvel, not that the networks are losing their grip on that community, but that they kept it as long as they did, and that a great nation accorded them the right to do so.

HEADLINE: Don't Extend Free-Trade Pact to Mexico

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Free-Trade Accord Is Enticing Canadian Companies to U.S." (front page, Aug. 9) stops short of presenting what would occur if the United States free-trade accord with Canada were extended to Mexico. There would be a stampede of United States companies to benefit from the truly low wage scales prevalent there, plus the low taxes and lax, if any, government regulation on the environment and social welfare. 
 Thousands in the United States would be unemployed. What could they be retrained for? Massive social, political and economic problems would result.
Canada is slowly and painfully starting to realize its mistake. If Quebec secedes, the rest of the country will have no choice except to be a United States satellite, officially or not. Canada, with 25 million inhabitants, lost its leverage in trading with the United States when trade and tariff barriers were removed and American goods could enter without the tariffs that had previously protected Canadian jobs and industry.
Let us pray that the concern for America's domestic problems will cause this country's leaders to realize that the accord with Mexico could bring massive problems affecting every aspect of our life, and not for the good.

HEADLINE: Coup Barely Slowed Visiting U.S. Investors

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
For a group of American money managers seeking investment opportunities in the Soviet Union last week, it was business as usual, despite the tanks.
"Everyone, on all sides of the conflict, was demonstrating that the business arrangements they were making would continue, regardless of the coup," Dean LeBaron, the leader of the American group, said yesterday in a telephone interview from his summer home in New London, N.H. "The association between politics and economics is more in the eyes of Westerners than the Soviets." 
 Mr. LeBaron, the chief executive of Batterymarch Financial Management in Boston, has been spending a lot of time in the Soviet Union meeting with politicians and officials of companies that are to be privatized. A group he headed arrived in Moscow on Sunday, Aug. 18, the day before the short-lived coup was disclosed.
Throughout the week, the group met with government and business officials in Moscow, Kiev and Leningrad, seeing a society try, successfully for the most part, to function as normal even while hard-line Communists seized power and then lost it. The Americans flew home on Friday, using the same private planes that had flown them around the Soviet Union.
"Even while the coup was in place," added Dennis A. Tito, the president of Wilshire Associates, a pension consulting firm and a member of the group, "the commitment of all the people we met continued to be very solid in moving toward a market economy." Mr. Tito was interviewed by telephone yesterday from his home in Santa Monica, Calif.
Mr. LeBaron, who hopes to invest about $200 million from a Batterymarch fund in a group of Soviet companies this fall, said he thought the eventual makeup of the Government in the Soviet Union would have had little impact on the opening of the country to Western capital.
"Politics matter some, but it is not the overwhelming thing," he said. "The Soviet Union needed us before this coup, and still needs us now."
Aleksandr N. Kuznetsov, an official of a Leningrad company in which Batterymarch plans to invest, said he thought economic reform would have been set back if the coup had succeeded. "These persons," he said of the coup leaders, "were eager to keep all of the ties with the Western countries in their hands." That, he said, would have made joint ventures much more difficult to arrange.
But Mr. Kuznetsov, who was staying with Mr. LeBaron in New London, is now optimistic about the chances for Soviet economic reform -- in part because of the promotion of Ivan Silayev, a Russian republic official who signed the degree for a free economic zone this summer, making possible foreign investments. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev named Mr. Silayev on Saturday to head a committee to take charge of the national economy.
Mr. Kuznetsov is deputy director in charge of research and development for Leningrad Optical and Mechanical Enterprises. He is to become head of a Leningrad Optical venture that will seek to develop export markets for telescopes and other optical products.
That company, Mr. LeBaron said, will get investments both from a Western optical maker and from Batterymarch's new Soviet Companies Fund, in which institutional investors are participating. Mr. Kuznetsov is scheduled to present plans for the company to a meeting of the Boston Society of Securities Analysts on Wednesday, in the first such presentation in the United States by a Soviet firm.
Batterymarch has a seven-person office in Moscow, devoted to looking for opportunities, largely among companies that were involved in making products for the military. "The military sector has the best management, the best access to resources," Mr. LeBaron said.
 
Other Companies Attract Interest
 Besides Leningrad Optical, Mr. LeBaron named two other companies in which he was committed to investing. One was Leninitz, a Leningrad-based company that he said was the "closest thing to a Soviet analog to General Electric," with interests ranging from high-technology items to consumer goods and including a growing operation in financial services.
The other is an amalgam of Kiev Aircraft Production Works and the Tupelev Design Bureau. He said Kiev Aircraft would stop making its flagship product -- the largest military cargo plane in the world -- and concentrate on a 100-seat commercial aircraft, to be available in both jet and turbo-prop models. The two enterprises are being combined because Tupelev had designed the planes that Kiev built, he said.
In each case, Mr. LeBaron said, Batterymarch is attempting to find a Western partner to provide investments and marketing help. In addition, the Soviet Companies Fund will make direct investments in the firms.
When Mr. LeBaron and his colleagues were in Kiev on Wednesday, they met with officials of the Ukrainian government, who said they were determined to declare their independence from the Soviet Union but stressed that their intention should not affect investment plans, Mr. LeBaron said. The Ukrainian Parliament did declare independence on Saturday and set a referendum on the issue for Dec. 1.
 
'We First Noticed Tanks'
 Mr. LeBaron said his group heard that Mr. Gorbachev had been replaced while they were having breakfast on Monday at a house used by Batterymarch in Moscow. Later that day, when the group met with officials of a company on the outskirts of Moscow, "we first noticed tanks guarding a power station, and it was not until that point that we began thinking this was more than a normal change of Government." The first announcements had simply said Mr. Gorbachev was ill and was being replaced by his vice president.
Mr. LeBaron said that as the group continued its meetings during the week, only one of dozens of companies, a maker of subway cars, canceled a scheduled appointment.
"We had appointments with high officials of the Soviet, Russian and Ukrainian governments. "Everyone went to a great deal of effort to meet with us, to send the impression that everything would continue," Mr. LeBaron said.
When they met with officials of the Russian government, he said, "we knew they had come out from the Parliament building, where they were heavily armed." But he said the meetings were conducted on the assumption that business would continue.
In Leningrad on Thursday, he said, meetings went on as scheduled, but there was a growing sense of glee in the population as word spread that the coup had failed. "The air struck me, sort of like the air in this country after the Desert Storm war," he said. "There was a very high level of euphoria."

HEADLINE: Blocs Seen Replacing Free Trade

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug. 25

 BODY:
In an unusually blunt discussion, economists and central bank officials from various countries expressed concern over the weekend that the regional trading blocs emerging in Europe, North America and Asia could eventually destroy the world's free-trade system.
A few of those attending the Federal Reserve's annual summer conference, including the keynote speaker, went a step further. They argued that the 40-year-old free-trade system, in which more than 90 nations jointly agree to lower tariffs simultaneously, had outlived its usefulness and should give way to these regional trading blocs. The blocs can use tariffs to keep out imports from nations that are not members.
 
Europe, North America Cited
 These economists said that the European Community and the emerging United States-Mexico-Canada trading zone were already proving more effective than the older free-trade system, known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, on two important counts. The blocs are generating huge increases in trade among neighboring countries, which are natural trading partners anyway. And, the economists said, regional blocs are becoming a way to exclude Japanese competitors, whose products receive equal treatment in the free-trade system. 
 "We should not backslide from the lower worldwide tariffs that have been negotiated, but the levers for going forward are broken," Paul R. Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in the keynote address. "In the real world," he said, the trend toward regional trading blocs "is as good as we are going to get."
The conventional wisdom, often offered by the Bush Administration, is that trading blocs should supplement multilateral trade when all nations reduce tariffs and other import barriers. But those attending the two-day conference in Grand Teton National Park, organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, did not challenge the contention that the GATT free-trade system, under which most of the world's countries have jointly agreed every decade or so to lower tariffs, could begin to fade under pressure from the trading blocs.
 
U.S. Position Described >
 This year, the group of more than 100 economic experts included such influential officials as Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve; Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France, and Andrew D. Crockett, executive director of the Bank of England.
Even an Administration official, Michael R. Darby, Commerce Department Under Secretary for economic affairs, acknowledged the threat that trading blocs pose to the free-trade system. "It is a problem that has to be dealt with, and it is being addressed," Mr. Darby said.
The Administration is committed in particular to promoting worldwide trade through the current GATT effort to reduce tariffs, called the Uruguay Round. These negotiations are stalled because the European Community refuses to reduce barriers to agricultural imports.
Summarizing the discussion here, Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, said, "I worry about regional trading areas, presumably justified in the first instance as liberalizing trade," but potentially capable of blocking it.
Mr. de Larosiere agreed that the three emerging trading zones, in Western Europe, North America and Asia, "raised fears, and rightly so, that these blocs-in-formation will close themselves off from external partners."
That would happen if tariffs were used to exclude imports from outside these blocs.
 
Criticizing and Defending Japan
 Many of those at the conference did not take kindly to Professor Krugman's surprising observation that trading zones are a useful way to compete against Japan. Japan is often perceived as not playing by the same trading rules as other industrial nations.
Professor Krugman said that belief "has done a great deal to undermine the perceived effectivness and legitimacy of the GATT in the United States and Europe." He added, "So the great advantage of regional pacts is that they can exclude Japan."
One of those with whom the remark did not sit well was Mr. de Larosiere. Such national antagonisms afflicted France and Germany after World War II, he replied, but their political leaders, Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer, defused the anger. He said polticians today should similarly defuse the anti-Japan sentiment.
C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, warned that anti-Japan sentiment, if it lasted, would result in serious trade conflicts. And Yoshio Suzuki, vice chairman of the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo, appealed for understanding of Japan.
The emerging East Asian bloc, Mr. Suzuki said, "is not an effort to form a trading bloc, but rather to form a negotiating bloc with enough leverage to negotiate entry to the United States and the European Community." He added, "We fear the regional trade bloc trend."
But Mr. Suzuki's appeal did not meet with much sympathy from Lawrence Summers, chief economist for the World Bank in Washington. He said the GATT-style free trade sought by Mr. Suzuki failed to deal effectively with quotas and other nontariff rules that restrict imports into Japan and the United States.
 
Drawbacks of the Bloc System
 Much of the debate centered on the drawbacks of the emerging system in which European countries trade primarily among themselves, and the United States, Canada and Mexico similarly are beginning to conduct commerce as if they are one country. The main drawback to this system, economists noted, is that exports from third-world countries could easily be excluded.
What is more, Mr. Bergsten said, the United States might end up paying too much for products within the zone that could be imported more cheaply from outside it. If the United States, for example, ended its textile quota, the increased imports in a free-trade world would come from East Asia, not from Mexico, whose textiles are more expensive.
Whatever the costs of this trade diversion, one view of the future seemed widely accepted at the conference: With the European trading bloc solidified, the formation of a North American alliance in the next two years could easily tilt the world away from free trade.
"This, in turn, will make it harder for Japan and others in Asia to resist pursuing defensive arrangements of their own," Mr. Bergsten said.

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
Immediate U.S. Recognition Of Baltic States Is Expected

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 25

 BODY:
The Bush Administration expects the Baltic states to be granted independence as early as Monday and is prepared to respond immediately by giving the new countries official recognition and naming envoys, American officials said today.
Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, said Washington had been told that a motion granting the Baltics independence would be introduced in the Soviet national Parliament, which convenes Monday, and other American officials said they had assurances that the proposal would be adopted. 
 Administration officials said Washington had been pressing Soviet officials to speed independence for the Baltics through what one called "quiet diplomacy."
But Mr. Bush was holding to his cautious position that American policy will not formally change until the Soviet Union itself acts. Washington does not consider Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to be part of the Soviet Union, but has never named an ambassador or attempted to establish formal ties.
 
U.S. in Uncomfortable Position
 That left the United States in the uncomfortable position today of resisting what several European countries have already done and what even the Russian Government has been urging. And it raised the danger for Mr. Bush that after taking the forefront in the West's resistance to the Kremlin putsch, he will end up following the lead of Europe on this and other issues involving the Soviet Union's future.
As it waited for Baltic independence, which will remove one of the greatest irritants in Soviet-American relations, the United States was moving slowly, but clearly, to change its policy on the Soviet Union in at least two other areas.
In televised interviews and in discussions with reporters here with the vacationing President, senior American officials, including Mr. Scowcroft and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, put political distance between the United States and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev while embracing President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian Federation as the real power in his country.
And Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d indicated that the United States was preparing to relax its opposition to increasing economic aid to Moscow.
Mr. Bush is certain to come under pressure on this issue as he meets in Kennebunkport this week with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, who arrived today for an overnight stay, and Prime Minister John Major of Britain, who arrives on Wednesday.
 
Indirect Messages
 But those important prospective changes were largely being telegraphed in indirect ways by senior officials, both in public and in private, and Washington's official stand continued to be one of caution and hesitation in the face of the extraordinary changes in the Soviet Union.
Mr. Bush said Washington was "just biding our time" for the Soviet Union to take action toward the Baltics and was silent for a second day on the crumbling of Communist power in the Soviet Union, an event that four decades of Presidents have made the central focus of American foreign policy.
Mr. Bush has reacted to other seminal events -- like the destruction of the Berlin Wall in 1989 -- with seeming nonchalance, in part because he prefers to conduct his foreign policy in private with a few chosen world leaders.
But it also reflects his difficulty with the public nature of the Presidency. Mr. Bush, who does best in small groups and worst when speaking to the nation about complex, emotion-laden events, flashes obvious irritation at suggestions that he should strike a more eloquent public posture on events like those in Moscow or, indeed, lead world reaction.
 
Debate Over Tactics
 Aides said the Administration's public handling of events since the coup failed in the Soviet Union also resulted from a debate over tactics in which Mr. Scowcroft, who follows Mr. Bush's predilection for secrecy and low-key public statements, prevailed over Mr. Cheney, who is given to tough talk and bold gestures.
Mr. Bush and his aides argue that they can be more effective behind the scenes than with the grand gesture. But the restrained response risks putting Mr. Bush on the sidelines, as he was during Eastern Europe's upheaval, and has already left him to follow Europe's lead on economic aid and the Baltics.
Although Administration officials said the United States would not take unilateral action on the Baltics, they said they expected the Soviet Union to free the republics quickly. "We have indications that such a motion will be introduced by some of the deputies in the Supreme Soviet," Mr. Scowcroft told reporters here.
Appearing on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," Mr. Cheney said, "Well, I think that's basically a question of formality at this point. I only expect it to be a relatively short period of time until there will be recognition of the independence of the Baltic republics."
Another Administration official said: "We're telling them to let the Baltics go. We're encouraging them in that direction with quiet diplomacy and as soon as the Soviet Parliament votes, we'll recognize them almost instantaneously, and that would include naming ambassadors and the like. That will stimulate the Ukrainians and others to roll ahead too."
The United States has been waiting for concrete actions from the Soviet Union on economic reform before it agrees to boost its so-far-modest financial aid and cooperation programs.
But, hours before Mr. Mulroney arrived at Walker's Point, the Bush family compound, Mr. Baker indicated that this might change. "The explosive events over the course of the past week really will present us -- the United States and the rest of the West as a matter of fact -- with an opportunity to pursue an expanded agenda," he said in an appearance on the ABC News program "This Week."
Since Mr. Gorbachev was restored to power, Mr. Bush has taken pains to make it clear that he still considers Mr. Gorbachev the legitimate head of state, and Mr. Bush can be expected to observe protocol as long as Mr. Gorbachev is in office.
But the Administration made it clear today that it was moving away from Mr. Gorbachev.
Mr. Cheney, the most forthright of the senior officials who commented on the question, was asked if he thought the United States is "better off" with Mr. Yeltsin than Mr. Gorbachev. He replied, "That is clearly my view."
Mr. Cheney went on, "Boris Yeltsin at this point represents a set of principles and values that are synonymous with those that we hold for the Soviet Union -- democratization, demilitarization -- and I think that's not surprising to anybody."

HEADLINE: Ending 10 Years of Rebuilding, M.T.A. Wants 5 More

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
A $16 billion, 10-year program to overhaul New York City's subways, bus lines and commuter railroads -- one of the most costly rebuilding efforts ever undertaken in the New York region -- will come to an end this year.
But officials of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which has directed the vast project, are scrambling to convince state legislators that more rebuilding is desperately needed. And they are asking for more money -- $11.5 billion over the next five years. 
 That may be a tall order. New York State, with chronic budget shortfalls, is considered likely to approve some version of a new rebuilding plan but less likely to agree to one as ambitious as the M.T.A. is proposing. As for the Federal Government, it has been reluctant to make more financing available for local mass-transit systems.
Some state legislators have expressed their desire to help. But many note that in these tight economic times, arguments for new spending must be very compelling.
 
Concern About Wasting Money
 At issue is whether the $16 billion allocated in the last 10 years to rejuvenate the region's transit system was well spent and whether the projects proposed in the new rebuilding plan are necessary, given the region's fiscal troubles.
Some lawmakers have accused the M.T.A. of wasting billions of dollars in cost overruns and project delays in past capital spending programs. The lawmakers also say that the M.T.A. has so far done a poor job of explaining how riders would benefit from more rebuilding.
Because the transit network has been improved so much in the last decade, these lawmakers say, the need for continued rebuilding is not as crucial as it was 10 years ago, when the system was falling apart.
Supporters of the new spending plan argue that mass transit is so important to the region that further projects deserve top priority. They also argue that more rebuilding would stimulate the region's economy and create thousands of new jobs.
"Anyone who questions the need for a new capital program should think back to the days when this system went to hell," said Peter E. Stangl, the M.T.A. chairman. "If we don't finish this rebuilding effort, that's exactly where we will end up again."
Under the proposed new capital improve ment program, M.T.A. officials would continue to buy new subway cars and buses, lay new track, replace signals and other obsolete equipment and rebuild maintenance and storage yards. They also plan to refurbish subway stations and install new signs and public-address systems.
Among the improvements proposed are: electronic turnstiles designed to deter fare beaters; a subway tracking system that would better allow workers to tell where trains are and to inform passengers when trains will arrive; emergency call boxes in each subway car to allow passengers to talk to the conductor, and a connection between the 63d Street Tunnel and Queens Boulevard to reduce crowding on subway lines between Manhattan and Queens.
The work would be financed by the state, city and Federal governments.
Precisely who would benefit from a new rebuilding program is far less certain today than it was 10 years ago because fewer people are taking mass transit and service is being reduced. The M.T.A.'s subsidiary agencies -- the New York City Transit Authority, which operates the subways and buses, the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad -- have seen a sharp decline in ridership in the last year. Each is planning or considering fare increases and cutbacks in service to help offset swelling budget deficits.
 
A Shambles in '81
 Transit officials gained support for the last two capital rebuilding programs mainly by showing that upgrading the transit system would improve service and thus attract new riders.
In 1981, New York City's transit system was plagued by delays, derailments, track fires, mechanical breakdowns and graffiti. The situation was so bad that the State Legislature declared a "transportation emergency" and passed an $8 billion program to overhaul the system after heavy lobbying by Richard Ravitch, the M.T.A. chairman at the time.
The Transit Authority received most of the financing. Its deteriorating tracks, switches and signals were rebuilt; new subways and buses were purchased, and an aggressive anti-graffiti program was set up. The L.I.R.R. and Metro-North also bought new cars and renovated major sections of track. The work was expanded in 1986 when the Legislature passed a second $8 billion capital program.
Today, the system is vastly improved. In 1981, subway trains ran an average of only 7,000 miles between breakdowns, but now trains go an average of 30,000 miles before a failure. The graffiti that once covered trains and buses have been largely scrubbed away. More than 90 percent of the subway and bus fleet has been replaced and is air-conditioned. The commuter railroads have expanded their routes and are running closer to schedule.
 
Liking What They've Seen
 Lawmakers, mass-transit advocacy groups, regional planners and even some of the M.T.A.'s most ardent critics interviewed last week acknowledged that the rebuilding program has greatly improved the system, and all agree that a new capital program is needed.
"The misery and frustration of being booted off a train two to three times a week because of a breakdown is now a thing of the past," said Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a consumer advocacy group for subway and bus riders. "Was the money spent perfectly? The answer is no. But did the $16 billion result in changes that riders can see everyday? The answer is yes, yes, yes."
While lawmakers agree that some form of capital spending program will be approved, they are less confident that the M.T.A. will get the $11.5 billion it wants. Some legislators, in fact, are asking whether the transit system has improved to the point where it is now politically tolerable to postpone the rebuilding effort until the economy rebounds.
 
Demanding 'Decent Answers'
 Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the Assembly's Corporations, Authorities and Commissions Committee, which would play an important role in any state financing, said he would have difficulty supporting many of the proposed projects because the M.T.A. had not indicated how the projects would improve service and ridership.
"Unless I get decent answers to these type of questions, I cannot recommend funding these projects," Mr. Nadler said. "We are seeking this information, not because we think they are hiding something from us, but because we want them to plan correctly."
But the chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, Senator Norman J. Levy, a Republican of Melville, L.I., said that while the transit system is significantly better than it was 10 years ago, the M.T.A. has wasted billions of dollars in cost overruns and project delays through mismanagement.
The Senator said that by his calculations the M.T.A.'s capital program is about $3.5 billion over budget. He has called on State Comptroller Edward V. Regan to conduct a comprehensive audit of all capital projects. M.T.A. officials have said that such calculations are absurd and that by their best estimate the capital programs are a few hundred millions dollars over budget.
 
Planning to Lobby Hard
 M.T.A officials said that a new capital spending program is vital to preserving the improvements that have been made in the last decade and to retaining and attracting riders. The officials have made the new capital program a top priority and are planning to lobby heavily for it in Albany next month when they submit the plan to the Legislature.
The Transit Authority president, Alan F. Kiepper, said in an internal memo to another agency official last month that the authority should "avoid any service changes that would cause a distraction to legislators that might make it more difficult to gain their support."
Richard T. Anderson, president of the Regional Planning Association, a private research group, supports the new capital program. "It would be a hideous mistake for us to think that we have solved the problem by buying some new subway cars and buses and replacing some track."
 
More Tax Revenues and Jobs
 Mr. Anderson added that a new M.T.A. capital program would help stimulate the region's weak economy. He cited a recent study by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that found that the M.T.A.'s past capital programs had stimulated $19 billion in economic activity, generated $741 million in tax revenues and created 14,000 jobs.
Still, money for the new program is uncertain. M.T.A. officials said that under the $11.5 billion capital plan they would anticipate a financing shortfall of about $5.5 billion.
Mortimer L. Downey 3d, the authority's chief financial officer, said the shortfall could be partly offset by using more revenue from taxes that were passed in June specifically for transportation needs. Raising money through bond issues was another option, Mr. Downey said. But he said the M.T.A. was less likely to do that because of the high cost of servicing the debt.

HEADLINE: Hartford Offers Sobering Lessons As More States Face Tax Troubles

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Connecticut's bitter struggle over revamping its revenue system and imposing an income tax may be just the first in a wave of such battles in state capitols from Texas to New Hampshire, politicians and economists say.
Those experts believe that with a decrease in Federal aid and increased burdens on state governments, many state tax structures -- created primarily during two earlier periods of intense budget pressures in the 1930's and 1960's -- have become antiquated and strained. 
 "Connecticut's success in adopting an income tax, along with the other things they did in the budget, is a boost for governors and legislators who want to take on problems head on," said Steven D. Gold, the director of the Center for the Study of the States at the State University of New York at Albany.
But state government has changed markedly since the 30's or the 60's, and many politicians and economists say that a sweeping tax overhaul is probably more difficult than ever. Overall tax burdens are higher now, party controls over state politicians are weaker, legislatures are much less the kept creatures of strong governors, and the public is more cynical of politicians and their promises.
Here in Connecticut, the income-tax battle was intertwined with an unusual political drama that pitted a reluctant Legislature against a determined, independent Governor. The 4.5 percent income tax adopted on Thursday was pushed through a Democratic-controlled legislature by Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a third-party Governor who made up in fierce stubbornness what he lacked in party clout in the General Assembly.
Mr. Weicker developed a reputation as a maverick in 18 years as a liberal Republican in the United States Senate. As Governor, he vetoed three budgets and ordered a partial shutdown of the state government over the summer to drive home his insistence that "the figures" demanded dramatic change.
His actions have led many politicians and economists to ask whether changing tax systems elsewhere will take a crisis like Connecticut's or a man like Mr. Weicker -- without party ties and commitments and, perhaps, without an overweening interest in being re-elected -- or whether such a figure prolongs the turmoil.
Even states that already have an income tax, like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, have been thrust into political turmoil in dealing with the current intense fiscal pressures.
But the political difficulties are most acute for states that do not yet have an income or sales tax. "The political costs of originating a new tax get higher and higher the more singular the state is," said Richard F. Winters, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. "It's a lot easier to become the 26th state than to become the 47th."
Nine states have no income tax: New Hampshire, Tennessee, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, Florida, Alaska, Wyoming and Nevada. And five have no sales tax: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon. State budget experts predict that perhaps half of those, led by New Hampshire, Texas and Tennessee, will try to create an entirely new tax category over the next decade, a feat achieved just twice in the last 20 years -- by New Jersey, with an income tax in 1976, and now by Connecticut.
 
New Hampshire Next?
 New Hampshire will almost certainly be the next battleground. In January, the Legislature in Concord will consider a bill to create a 6 percent flat-rate income tax, and supporters believe that they have the votes. Gov. Judd Gregg, a Republican, has vowed a veto, and the bill's main sponsor has already conceded that for the moment, an override is impossible.
"It will probably be the paramount issue in the next gubernatorial campaign" in 1992, said Representative Douglas E. Hall, a Republican and the author of New Hampshire's proposed income tax bill.
Mr. Hall, echoing the sentiments of other political observers, said Connecticut's struggles have been only marginally instructive for other states, because the tax system and public perception of it differs in each state.
And what may be instructive about Connecticut's ordeal -- with its drawn-out confrontation, threat of layoffs and likely political fallout -- is probably frightening to most politicians.
 
'Game of Chicken'
 Mr. Weicker got an income tax passed despite the lack of even a single member of his tiny party in the legislature. He proposed the income tax in February as part of a sweeping budget overhaul, then simply said no to any traditional budget alternative.
Norman Ornstein, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said he doubted at first that Mr. Weicker would succeed here, in part because of the independence he displayed in the United States Senate.
"His greatest strength as a Senator was in standing up on the floor and saying, 'I'm going to raise terribly uncomfortable issues and make an ass of myself until you cave in,' " Mr. Ornstein said.
Alan Rosenthal, director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, said: "If you're willing to do what you believe in and fight for it, you can win -- that's what this shows. But you've got to be able to do one thing: lose an election. Weicker certainly knew what he was getting into."
 
Texas Proposal
 In the last income-tax battle, in New Jersey in 1976, Gov. Brendan T. Byrne pushed the proposal through under the weight of a court order that said the school systems were not being properly financed; a new statewide revenue source had to be found. In Connecticut, Mr. Weicker had no such mandates, but only the argument that an income tax would allow other taxes to be lowered, and so stimulate the state's depressed economy.
In Texas, Lieut. Gov. Bob Bullock proposed an income-tax plan earlier this year that was linked to a reduction in property taxes. It was rejected in the Legislature, but Brad Reynolds, a spokesman for Mr. Bullock, said the Lieutenant Governor remains committed to pressing forward. He said Mr. Bullock, who is elected independently of the governor and presides over the Senate, believes a stalemate and brinkmanship can be avoided.
Mr. Gold, of the Center for the Study of the States, said he thought that Tennessee and South Dakota would test the waters next, followed by Washington, then perhaps Florida. He said he also expected that Montana and Oregon would impose state sales taxes for the first time before the decade is out.
Declining Federal aid and soaring state costs for Medicaid and prison expansion are expected to fuel the drive. This year alone, the combined deficits in state budgets reached an estimated $50 billion, resulting in perhaps $23 billion in state tax increases, according to several surveys conducted earlier in the year. Connecticut's tax increase alone was $1.1 billion, the largest one-year jump in state history.
 
Political Risks
 But the political risks of a major tax overhaul have always been high, historians say. In the 1930's, for example, when many states imposed income or sales taxes for the first time to try to compensate for plummeting property-tax collections during the Depression, incumbent governors were kicked out of office in the next election 24 percent of the time, said Susan B. Hansen, a University of Pittsburgh professor.
Here in Connecticut, where the Democrats control both chambers of the General Assembly, and provided the majority for the income tax over the opposition of a largely united Republican minority, this summer's votes are already seen as an issue in the 1992 elections. Every member of the House and Senate will face re-election, though Mr. Weicker will not. Mr. Ornstein said the outcome would be keenly watched from Washington.
"The public debate on this question is not over," said the Connecticut Republican Party chairman, Richard Foley Jr. "Not for at least a year and a half."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Strange Contrast In Japan Economy

BYLINE: By James Sterngold

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
TWO recent news items here captured Japan's economic paradox in a nutshell: A survey showed that Japanese companies planned to increase capital investment in the current fiscal year by a hefty 8.4 percent, more than double the expected growth rate for the economy, which is now in the longest period of expansion since World War II; meanwhile, a tiny article noted that the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where business has been miserable, for the first time had to take out a large loan to pay its operating expenses.
The contrast between the buoyant economy, perhaps the world's most vigorous, and the sickly stock market is stark. Does the ailing market know something the economy does not? 
 There is a surprisingly wide divergence of opinions on this issue, but increasingly the experts are agreeing on one crucial point: if the stock market falls much below its current depressed level, the Japanese economy will feel the squeeze. In fact, there is growing speculation that the Bank of Japan may be forced to cut its discount rate this fall to prod the market back to life.
Many foreigners tend to favor the view that the market is expecting choppy economic waters.
Indeed, the capital investment rate, though high by the standards of any other country, is at about half the investment rate of last year. And the overall economy is expected to expand only 3.5 percent this year, down from more than 5 percent last year.
Many Japanese, on the other hand, look at the contrary directions of the market and the economy as proof of how peripheral and unimportant the stock market is to the nation's general health.
Japanese individuals play a far smaller role in the stock market here, owning only about 25 percent of the shares, compared with well over 50 percent in the United States.
By any measure, Japan has gone through an extraordinary boom in the last five years. Each year it has expanded by an amount roughly equal to the total gross national product of South Korea. A spectacular increase in capital investment has not only led the charge, but has also made Japan Inc. leaner and meaner as it roars into the 1990's.
Even so, all agree that some sort of slowdown is in store. But the varied predictions do not seem to justify the deep depression into which the market has tipped. Even before the attempted coup in the Soviet Union sent prices skidding, even before a series of financial scandals cast a pall on the financial industry, the market was floundering.
Steep interest rate rises two years ago began the slide, while Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last year delivered the coup de grace. The stock market has yet to recover.
The Nikkei index of 225 stocks has sputtered recently in a range from 21,000 to 24,000, about 40 percent below the market's peak on the last day of 1989. On Friday, the index closed at 22,065.34 after a seesaw week, and in late trading today it was down to 21,543.94. While Wall Street recovered from the shock of the Soviet coup to post a new record, Tokyo lost more than 700 points over all.
Even worse for the health of the securities industry, volume has plummeted. The average so far this year is barely 400 million shares a day, compared with a peak of more than a billion shares a day, on average, in 1988.Even those who scoffed at the problems earlier are now paying heed. If the Nikkei stock index does dip below 20,000, said Yoshihisa Kitai, chief economist at the Long-Term Credit Bank, "then the real economy would definitely be affected."
One reason is that it will become increasingly difficult for companies to finance capital investment. When the market was soaring, companies issued an unprecedented amount of securities to bolster investment programs. Much of the money was raised in the form of convertible bonds and bonds with warrants attached.
These instruments give the holders the right to buy company shares at a fixed price within a specified period. The companies, believing the market would keep rising, expected to repay the sums borrowed by issuing new shares, not with cash.
With the slump, however, most holders are expected to choose cash. According to one survey, about $73 billion worth of such bonds will come due in the next three years. One way the companies plan to make the payouts is, of course, by selling more securities. Analysts fear that the new supply could cause the market to tumble and crimp corporate Japan's ability to raise capital. So worrisome is this prospect that the Bank of Japan commented last week that it would insure that the repayments were handled smoothly, presumably by cutting interest rates.
Another way the tumbling market would affect the "real" economy is by reducing bank lending, which is already growing at its slowest pace in years. Much of the capital of Japan's banks is invested in shares. When share prices decline, their capital bases decline. And that cuts into their ability to make new loans. Once again, analysts agree that 20,000 on the Nikkei is a critical point.
"The stock market is reacting to a worst-case scenario," said Richard Koo, a senior economist at the Nomura Research Institute. "But I think the Bank of Japan and the Finance Ministry are scared. It's a delicate situation that is going to get much worse if the stock market falls below 20,000."

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL: SOVIETS' RUSH TOWARD DISUNION SPREADS; EUROPE EMBRACING BALTIC INDEPENDENCE;
PURGE OF MILITARY

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Following quickly on the rout of the Communist Party, the unraveling of the Soviet Union itself gained speed today, with one republic after another joining the rush to independence or laying claim to powers of the central government.
One day after the vital Ukraine declared its independence, Byelorussia unexpectedly followed suit, Moldavia announced it would vote on a similar declaration Monday, and Western governments began recognizing the secession of the three Baltic republics. 
 President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian republic, who has emerged in the aftermath of the failed coup by hard-liners as the predominant political figure in the country, said in a television interview that he hoped the mainstay repulics would sign a treaty next month reorganizing the country into a looser federation.
But with 8 of the 15 republics now asserting or contemplating claims of full independence, there were growing doubts that even Mr. Yeltsin could find a formula to halt the dismembering of this nuclear superpower.
 
Repercussions of Coup Attempt
 Aftershocks from the abortive coup against President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Soviet leader's subsequent abandonment of the Communist Party rolled across the country today.
A presidential spokesman announced that Mr. Gorbachev's military adviser, Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, had killed himself on Saturday night. No evidence has surfaced implicating Marshal Akhromeyev, the former chief of staff of the armed forces, in the attempted coup, but he was instrumental in promoting the military commanders who participated, and he had publicly belittled the danger of a putsch. [Obituary, page A13.]
The new Soviet Defense Minister announced plans for a wholesale purge that he said would replace "about 80 percent" of the top command structure with younger officers.
"The people must be younger than we have had, more loyal, and not capable of unconstitutional gambits," said the minister, Gen. Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, who as commander of the air force defied the conspirators and supported Mr. Yeltsin.
Shake-ups were also anticipated in the K.G.B. and Interior Ministry, following the collaboration of top national security officials in the three-day coup.
[The Speaker of the Soviet Parliament, Anatoly I. Lukyanov, who has been accused of complicity in the coup, resigned his post, according to Vitaly S. Ignatenko, a spokesman for Mr. Gorbachev who was quoted on a Cable News Network broadcast.]
Local governments across the country seized Communist Party buildings following Mr. Gorbachev's decree on Saturday effectively nationalizing the party's wealth. Citizens toppled monuments to Bolshevik heroes, prompting Mr. Yeltsin and other officials to plead for calm.
"There should be no euphoria of revenge," Mr. Yeltsin told a television interviewer tonight. "Otherwise we will lose our self-respect as democrats."
Mr. Gorbachev, who appears to have become essentially a junior partner in a coalition government with Mr. Yeltsin, was reported to be at work on a speech for an emergency session of the Soviet Parliament on Monday, which will seek to clarify the murky issue of just who is running the country.
 
Gains for Yeltsin
 Although the Soviet leader remains Commander in Chief of the armed forces, and is still formally in charge of the central Government, since his return from captivity he has ceded to the Russian president remarkable sway in dictating the shape of a future government.
On Saturday Mr. Gorbachev named Mr. Yeltsin's prime minister, Ivan S. Silayev, to head a committee charged with drastically reshaping the federal Government and decentralizing economic powers to the republics.
The four-member committee is dominated by Yeltsin loyalists, who favor slashing central ministries, privatizing state-owned industry and moving rapidly to a free market.
Mr. Yeltsin said he remains committed to a union treaty that would cede vast powers to the republics.
 
A Role for Gorbachev?
 The Yeltsin team, which once called for Mr. Gorbachev's resignation, now plans to retain Mr. Gorbachev in a scaled-back role, presiding over military and foreign policy and such centralized economic structures as the electric power grid.
"Mikhail Sergeyevich has not yet exhausted his potential," said Ruslan Khasbulatov, chairman of the Russian parliament, in an interview with the independent news agency Interfax. "I don't think that he needs to resign. We, the Russian government, will help him a great deal."
Mr. Yeltsin said today that he believed the republics should be represented in the National Security Council as a check on the Soviet president's handling of defense policy, and Mr. Khasbulatov suggested that in the new federation, the president would be chosen by the republics rather than in a general election.
 
A Different Viewpoint
 But aides involved in negotiations between the two leaders say that Mr. Gorbachev has not yet entirely resigned himself to the role of a figurehead.
In the appointment of a new chief of the security agencies, Mr. Gorbachev successfully insisted on putting his own man in charge of the K.G.B., for example. The parliamentary session gives Mr. Gorbachev a chance -- perhaps his last chance -- to describe how he sees his future role.
But the redistribution of powers is complicated by the eruption of secessionist sentiment, which is worrisome to both leaders.
In the Ukraine, the independence declaration calls for the republic to assume control of Soviet military assets on its territory and create its own army. The declaration, which requires popular ratification in a referendum in December, leaves unanswered the question of the nuclear weapons deployed there.
Mr. Yeltsin faces the additional predicament that the disintegration of the union could spread to his own domain. The Russian federation includes dozens of ethnic homelands, many of them itching for greater sovereignty.
 
Concern Over Ukraine
 A Yeltsin aide said today the Russian president would support the wishes of the Ukrainian people, but expressed concern about the loss of such a key republic. In addition to the question of the military and the Ukraine's importance as a farming and industrial stronghold, the aide said, the loss of its 52 million Slavs would tilt the ethnic balance of the remaining union toward the Muslims of Central Asia.
That concern grew today with news that the parliament in Byelorussia, the third Slavic republic, had approved an independence declaration. Byelorussia, with a population of 10 million the fifth largest republic, has long been regarded as the most conservative of the republics on the European portion of the Soviet Union, and has seemed relatively immune from the secessionist passions of its Baltic and Ukrainian neighbors.
The declaration was apparently designed by Byelorussian Communists, who still hold a majority in the parliament, as a way of insulating themselves from Mr. Gorbachev's decree ordering confiscation of party property. A smaller nationalist faction in the parliament also supported the move.
 
Byelorussian Leader Quits
 In another move to protect the party from the wave of anti-Communist sentiment, the hard-line Communist president of the republic, Nikolai Dementei, resigned under pressure.
The republic of Moldavia announced today that its parliament would vote on secession on Tuesday, a measure that is expected to pass.
"Moldavia will no longer be part of an empire which is falling to pieces," the speaker of its parliament, Alexandru Mosanu, told Reuters in Kishinev, the capital. "We shall become independent, and this is part of a chain reaction which no force in the world could stop now."
 
Recognition of Baltic Republics
 The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, whose claim to independence has been endorsed by Mr. Yeltsin but not Mr. Gorbachev, today began to win international recognition. Denmark and Norway announced that they would establish diplomatic relations with the breakaway republics, which were forcibly annexed in 1940.
Latvia and Estonia voted their independence this week, while Lithuania declared its freedom last year.
The German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, called on the European Community today to recognize Baltic independence, and there was mounting pressure in the United States for President Bush to do the same.
Mr. Gorbachev has insisted in the past that secession be carried out according to Soviet law, which requires a referendum and a waiting period of up to five years. He now finds himself under strong pressure from Mr. Yeltsin to acquiesce.
 
Military Commander Ousted
 The Soviet Government today showed signs of relaxing its stance on the Baltics. The commander of military forces in the region, a bitter foe of pro-independence governments, was dismissed for acquiescing in the coup.
The Latvian president, Anatoly Gorbunovs, met in Moscow today with leaders of the Soviet military, K.G.B. and Interior Ministry and announced afterward that they had agreed to suspend their activies in his republic and open negotiations on "disarmament."
In the aftermath of Mr. Gorbachev's resignation on Saturday as general secretary of the Communist Party, the party leadership today followed his urging and called for an emergency meeting to disband.
The party's administrative secretariat issued an appeal to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin to permit a special session of the governing Central Committee where "the only possible decision" would be dissolution.
In announcing his resignation on Saturday, Mr. Gorbachev noted that the party leadership had taken no position condemning the coup, that the main conspirators against him had been members of the Central Committee, and that party newspapers had supported the putsch.
Their behavior, he said, had exposed millions of rank-and-file Communists to the threat of anti-Communist hysteria.
The secretariat insisted that the coup plans were kept in secrecy and that party leaders "tried to do everything to prevent blood from being spilled."
Some republics have suspended or outlawed the party, and party buildings have been sealed pending investigation.

HEADLINE: El Gran Combo, on the Global Road, Moves Dancers to Mixed Salsa Beat

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS

 BODY:
It's a typically frenetic couple of weeks for El Gran Combo, Puerto Rico's finest salsa orchestra, and one of the greatest dance bands working. Tonight it will play at S.O.B.'s in Manhattan. Then it goes to Jersey City for a Wednesday night engagement, returning to Manhattan to headline a salsa show at Madison Square Garden on Saturday, followed by a late set at Club Broadway on the Upper West Side. Then it heads off for Providence, R.I., Bridgeport, Conn., and Reading, Pa. before coming back for a Queens date and then flying down for a three-city tour in Colombia.
Such is the life for an orchestra that has recorded 62 albums -- its most recent, "Erupcion" (Combo), has been hovering around the top 10 of the Latin charts in Billboard for a few months -- and has been together for 29 years. The 13-or-so-member group, which is swinging through the United States on one of its annual two or three North American tours, is an institution, and spends more than 10 months a year on the road proving it. 
 Its leader, main arranger and occasional pianist, Rafael Ithier, is the last remaining original member, but its fans don't care. For several generations, whole families have gone out to hear and dance to the blissful rhythms of El Gran Combo's fully choreographed shows.
"We are very proud," said Mr. Ithier, talking on the phone from Houston, where the band had a series of shows. "We represent in many ways Puerto Rico. We play and sing like Puerto Ricans, we present a symbol of Puerto Rico. It's our culture and we're proud of it."
Though the recession has been devastating to the Latin music scene in the United States, just as it has been for mainstream music, El Gran Combo has been fairly recession-resistant. For one thing, it plays only 30 to 40 dates a year in the United States, not that many on a schedule as heavy as its. For another, Europe has developed a taste for salsa, and El Gran Combo traveled there three times this year. It has been to France, Holland, England, Spain, Germany and Switzerland. Next year, it plans two more tours, one lasting an entire month.
 
The Norman Taste for Salsa
 "Europeans are very interested in the colonies now, it seems, and we're very popular in Europe, and not just in Spain," Mr. Ithier said. "Before they didn't know what it was, but Europeans have fallen in love with salsa. We were in a small town in Normandy, which was having a jazz festival, Branford Marsalis was there, and people were jumping up and down because of the rhythms. We got an invitation for next year, right after we finished playing."
In Puerto Rico, the band usually plays free at fiestas patronales, outdoor celebrations in town plazas that last a week or more. Or it will play at playeros, beach parties sometimes sponsored by beer or soft-drink companies. These performances accentuate the feeling that the orchestra is part of the community, that music is integral to festivals and occasions.
"I like to play in Puerto Rico the most because of the food, and it's home," Mr. Ithier said. "But we're accustomed to traveling, since we do it all the time. And I love to play New York, but really it's just like Puerto Rico. I've been coming to New York for 45 years, and everybody speaks Spanish, so it's also just like home. I get to see friends."
El Gran Combo uses a series of rhythms, all now coming under the title of salsa. Though Hispanic music from the Caribbean has been influenced by Afro-Cuban music, Puerto Rico has its own set of rhythmic and social traditions, including two called the bomba and the plena, music from African plantation workers and from poor coastal towns, respectively. El Gran Combo will dip into those, reinterpreting them. Mr. Ithier was an early member of the drummer Cortijo's orchestra, one of the first groups to use bomba and plena rhythms in popular music. And he learned the power of dance music from Cortijo.
"Our music is for dancing," Mr. Ithier said. "It's dance music and as a dance band our priority is to make people dance. When we first started, television was just beginning, and we knew that we had to make a show for the people. We thought that if the band danced, with choreography, it would be more entertaining. Now, the people have gotten accustomed to this, and every time we write a new tune we make a different dance. After we did that, everybody copied us."
But it is the music that motivates audiences. Bright and shiny, it seems timeless, a mixing of big band orchestral sounds with a tough percussion section. Since they play all the time, the band members can make the transcendent grooves that make dancing effortless.
Though fads come and go in the salsa world, El Gran Combo has kept its identity, playing new music that fits the older sound of the orchestra. It has become more sophisticated, but the basic impulse, to make people enjoy themselves, has remained the same. In an era when singers take their cue from mainstream Western pop, abandoning their bands in favor of attempts at superstardom, El Gran Combo remains a band dedicated to its audience.
"When I was with Cortijo, we had one trumpet and one sax and a rhythm section," Mr. Ithier said. "It was more primitive. We didn't have arrangements, really, and Cortijo would sing things that he wanted us to play because he didn't write music, so we'd remember everything. Now you have to have arrangements because we have musicians that read music. And we try to use something a little sophisticated. We have an individual sound; our fans know us. Three years ago I used different people to do arrangements who were very good musicians, but too modern, and a lot of people didn't like it. They had studied at Berklee, the music school, and it was too much. So we went back to what the people like."
S.O.B.'s is at 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street. Club Broadway is at 2551 Broadway, between 96th and 97th Streets.

HEADLINE: SoHo Adapts to Leaner Times With a Changing Gallery Scene

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
At a time when SoHo's eulogy has been written more than once, New York City's primary contemporary art gallery area is showing new signs of life, partly as a byproduct of problems that seemed to signal its decline.
Last season, a number of SoHo galleries succumbed to the pressures of high overheads and declining art sales: among them Petersburg, Gracie Mansion, Althea Viafora, Lang & O'Hara and Massimo Audiello. Still, as the new season approaches, it seems that more galleries are opening in the area than are closing, and they are being helped by a softened rental market caused by the recession. 
 In particular, SoHo's relatively quiet southwest quadrant, which in some spots still retains the rougher, less store-studded character of the area's pre-gallery days, is becoming home to an increasing number of new or relocated galleries. Many are run by young dealers who seem determined to show new young artists and, in the process, to change the way art galleries are operated. It's probably not by chance that many of these dealers are committed to casual, process-oriented art -- be it installation work, Conceptual art or abstract painting -- that tends to go against the grain of Neo-Geo, the last art movement of the 1980's.
 
The Frenzy Is Over
 In some ways, these dealers are making the best of a drastically altered situation: the shopping frenzy of the 1980's is over and the secondary, or resale, market has shrunk; collectors are buying more selectively, taking more time to make up their minds and expecting to get more for their money. Gone are the expensive renovations that characterized so many new galleries of the 1980's, a time increasingly called "the old days."
In the meantime, a softened rental market is enabling dealers to get better spaces in better locations or to open for the first time. And in a summer that is sometimes referred to as "the transition," a new no-frills approach is emerging, one that brings to mind the early 1970's in SoHo and the early 1980's in the East Village. Rough cement floors, patched walls and partial renovations to be completed later are in vogue, as are the adjectives "modest" and "low-key" and the phrase "focusing on just a few artists."
Several dealers plan to have "programs" (another popular word) that include performance art, film screenings or poetry readings, similar to those in so-called alternative spaces. In their scaled-back approach to gallery management and their emphasis on the new and experimental, they may prove what many people have maintained all along: that the drop in art prices, while bad for the market, could be good for art.
 
'More Space for Less Money'
 "I couldn't afford not to move," said Tom Cugliani, who is moving his three-year-old Tom Cugliani Gallery from Greenwich Street, several blocks beyond SoHo's western edge, to 40 Wooster Street. He said he planned to open in early October on the second floor, one flight up from the American Fine Arts Company, a three-year fixture on Wooster Street run by Colin de Land, an art dealer. American Fine Arts is best known for showing installation pieces by artists including Cady Noland, Jessica Diamond and Jessica Stockholder, all of whom were in this year's Whitney Biennial.
"The irony of this whole situation," Mr. Cugliani said, "is that it has provided me with a kind of window, enabling me to get more space for less money in a better location."
Another new tenant at 40 Wooster Street is Brent Sikkema Fine Arts, a photography gallery relocating from 153 Spring Street, one of SoHo's fancier gallery addresses. Like Mr. Cugliani, Mr. Sikkema said that he wanted to open in early October and that he would be "paying less rent for five times as much space."
These new gallery activities are creating one of SoHo's regular shifts in concentration. Centering on or near Wooster and Greene Streets between Broome and Grand Streets, the new galleries are joining others known for their relatively low profiles and unrenovated quarters.
 
Rough and Fancy
 These include American Fine Arts, Feature, Nicole Klagsbrun and Pat Hearn, whose spiffy ground floor (very smooth cement here) is balanced by a rough-hewed upper floor for installation art, performances and film showings. Larger fancier galleries in the area include the Drawing Center at 35 Wooster Street, Brooke Alexander Gallery at 59 Wooster Street and Brooke Alexander Editions and the Josh Baer Gallery, both at 476 Broome Street.
The arrivals to this area are tipping the balance of galleries away from Prince Street and especially the big multiple-gallery buildings at Prince Street and Broadway in SoHo's northeast corner. These are buildings whose anonymity and packaging, and particularly their atmosphere of one-stop art viewing, often seemed emblematic of the late 80's art boom.
Joe Fawbush, who with his partner, Tom Jones, will reopen the Fawbush Gallery at 76 Grand Street near Wooster Street, does not speak fondly of the gallery "mall" experience. "Never again," he said of the gallery in the large building at 578 Broadway, near Prince Street, that he and Mr. Jones opened in September 1987 and closed in June 1990, partly because of poor business, partly to rethink their entire operation. "Our first priority was not to be in a multi-gallery building," Mr. Fawbush said. "We like the idea of having our own identity."
After a year of private dealing and "a decision to focus ourselves on a scale that's frankly smaller," Mr. Fawbush said, he and Mr. Jones are now the sole tenants at their new address, a small one-story building with 20-foot ceilings. While they used to represent 10 artists, they will now represent only 5, including the painters Michelle Stuart and Ed Albers, and Kiki Smith, a maker of eerie figurative sculptures and installation pieces, also seen in this spring's Biennial. Like some other dealers, they plan to leaven their exhibitions with performance art and poetry readings. "We're bored with doing one show after another of gallery artists," Mr. Fawbush said. "We want to try to shake things up a bit."
 
'My Own Identity'
 Diane Brown, who forsook a ground-floor gallery on Greene Street for the mall building at 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, echoed Mr. Fawbush's disdain for such buildings. "I'm really anxious for an autonomous space," she said. "I want my own identity."
Having closed her Broadway gallery in the spring, she will open Sept. 6 on the ground floor at 23 Watts Street, near Broome Street and West Broadway, where she says she is "getting more for my money."
"I feel optimistic," Ms. Brown said. "I think it's a time of great opportunity. Anyone who says they haven't had a decline in business is lying. But now there won't be speculators. It will make everybody be better, think harder, work harder."
Not all the new ventures are within the southwest corner of SoHo. Elizabeth Koury, formerly a partner in the Koury-Wingate Gallery at 578 Broadway, will open on the fourth floor of 89 Greene Street, upstairs from the 303 Gallery, in the fall. She said she planned to represent only three or four artists and to have two-month exhibitions, which is longer than usual. "Slowing down the process is good for me and it's in keeping with the market," Ms. Koury said.
Of the current rental market she said: "I couldn't have done this at any other time."
Another newcomer will be Arena, a gallery that Renee Ricardo, who was an independent curator, will be opening on Sept. 21. Although her location is central, the second floor of a small brick building at 128 Wooster, on the corner of Prince Street, it measures only 600 feet square, the size of many dealers' private viewing rooms.
 
Openings to Occur
 There are also some openings planned on bigger, better-known or better-financed fronts. Larry Gagosian, for example, is renovating a large garage at 136 Wooster Street, just north of Prince. His second such space in the neighborhood (he runs 65 Thompson Street with Leo Castelli), it is scheduled to open in early November with an exhibition of new sculpture by Richard Serra.
Arthur Roger, a New Orleans Gallery, will open on the ground floor of the pricey 130 Prince Street building in mid-September, a move made possible by backing from the collector Frederick R. Weisman.
And the Blum Helman Gallery, whose main headquarters are on 57th Street, will reopen its ground-floor warehouse at 80 Greene Street, intermittently used for exhibitions, as a full-time gallery. Its activities will be directed by Max Lang, of the recently closed Lang & O'Hara Gallery, who says he plans to concentrate on younger non-Blum Helman artists.
 
Renovations in the 90's
 It is the more modest developments to the south, however, that seem more intriguing. Nordanstad-Skarstedt, a gallery run by two young Swedish dealers, Thomas Nordanstad and Per Skarstedt, will open at 49 Greene Street, next door to the Klagsbrun gallery, in October. Mr. Skarstedt said the gallery would show young unknown artists from Europe and America. "We're very interested in what's happening in New York," he said, "and in what will happen once this crisis is past." Sandra Gering, formerly on West 11th Street, will open Sept. 20 in a 2,000-square-foot gallery at 476 Broome Street. Last spring, she had a group show in the space when it was raw, and she is now making minimal renovations which she characterizes as "very rough and sort of in keeping with what the 1990's are about."
Several dealers express an admiration for installation art, which had its heyday was the early 1970's, another period of market quietness. And their admiration seems to be echoed in much of the art they're seeing in artists' studios. In the words of Colin de Land, whose American Fine Arts has helped set the local unvarnished tone, "I seem to be seeing some art that has no intrinsic object value, that's virtually nontransactable."
Pat Hearn strikes a more realistic note. "The new artists are out there," she said. "As long as new dealers can get started in the area, I think things will be in good shape."

Capriati Gets a Whipping That Doesn't Count

BYLINE: By FILIP BONDY

 BODY:
Jennifer Capriati was thumped with such ferocity yesterday afternoon by Gabriela Sabatini, she might have thought twice about her decision to play in the made-for-CBS exhibition one day before the start of the United States Open tennis championships.
But Capriati has more than a little Pollyanna in her, so she took her punishment, 6-3, 6-3, and insisted the 62-minute baseline fire drill at the National Tennis Center in Queens had been a great deal of fun. 
 "You know you're going out and giving the kids a show," Capriati said of her free match on the Stadium Court.
If the women's draw plays to form, Capriati and Sabatini will meet again in the quarterfinals of the Open sometime next week. Capriati will remember that she was dominated, once again, by the player who owns a 6-1 edge in their head-to-head tournament meetings. Capriati's only victory over the defending United States Open champion came three weeks ago, when Sabatini retired in the second set of their semifinal match at the Canadian Open.
"Sure, I'll know that she beat me the day before the tournament started," the 15-year-old Capriati said. "But I can't think about it. It's a new match."
The crowd was certainly different from the usual corporate cross-section. Only 6,500 fans attended, but they stayed in their seats on the changeovers and actually paid attention during lengthy rallies.
"It was great to be back here again," said Sabatini, 21, who pocketed $75,000 for her effort yesterday while Capriati donated her appearance fee. "I won my first Grand Slam here. The city, the lights, the crowd make this tournament special."
 
Roughin' It in the First Round
 The first round of the men's draw is filled with potential pitfalls for the top stars, and particularly for several of the Americans. Today, eighth-seeded Andre Agassi faces Aaron Krickstein -- a five-set ambush waiting to happen. Michael Chang, who has slipped to No. 23 in the world, meets tough Australian Mark Woodforde. Tonight, defending champion Pete Sampras will play Christo van Rensburg of South Africa. Woodforde and Van Rensburg have reached the fourth round of both Wimbledon and the United States Open.
"There's no easy ride to any Grand Slam tournament," Chang said yesterday, after a practice session. "I don't think it matters anymore if you're seeded or not. You're going to be playing somebody else who could easily be seeded.
"Ivan Lendl is playing a guy, Richard Krajicek, that most fans don't even know about, but the guy beat Stefan Edberg last week," Chang said, referring the Dutch player's upset victory in New Haven. "He could give Lendl a lot of trouble."
 
Tense Times for Soviets
 If the hard-liners' coup in the Soviet Union had succeeded, there might have been a wave of defections and substantial cold-war intrigue at this tournament. Most of the Soviet players were already in the New York area when President Mikhail Gorbachev was, in effect, held hostage. During that three-day eternity, they discussed with each other the notion of becoming permanent expatriates.
"We talked on the phone about it," said Yevgeniya Manyokova, who qualified into the main draw of the women's tournament. "I don't think we would go back to Moscow."
Under Gorbachev's reign, the Soviet players have traveled more freely and continued to fight for a greater share of their earnings. The players are now hopeful of even more liberalized rules.
"Everything is good now," Manyokova said. "I hope."
 
The Price is Out of Sight
 Back in the capitalist world: Spectators should be advised that the recession has not deflated prices at the refreshment stands around the National Tennis Center. A jumbo waffle ice cream cone will cost you $4.25; imported beer is $4.50; soda, $2.25; United States Open T-shirts, $18.49; sweatshirts, $29-$49; light jackets, $79.
The good news is that pizza, pretentiously called borboli for the last few years, is now being called pizza again. But it sells for a borboli-like $4.95 per serving.
 
Americans Aplenty
 There were 20 players from the United States in the 64-woman qualifiers draw, but none advanced to the main draw. Still, there is no shortage of American players at the Open -- 36 women and 34 men.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Coup Pre-empts Democrats' Agenda

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Like the war in the Persian Gulf, the crisis in the Soviet Union has given President Bush another chance to stride the stage as Commander in Chief and has consigned the Democrats to the wings, a hapless chorus struggling to change the subject.
In some ways it was a striking replay of the party's experience last summer: The Democrats seemed to be forcing the debate onto domestic issues, where Mr. Bush is widely perceived to be vulnerable, when world events suddenly pre-empted their script. 
 "This is the luckiest President in American history," said Celinda Lake, a Democratic poll taker, and at week's end many Democrats agreed.
But as the truism holds, a person makes his own luck, and the Democrats have been busily contributing to their own misery. The withdrawal of Senator Al Gore of Tennessee from the race for the Democratic nomination for President only underscored that the party's heavyweights, one by one, are walking away from the 1992 election. In Mr. Gore's case, the loss was particularly acute because he was widely seen as one of the few potential candidates who could hold his own on foreign policy issues.
 
A Critique of Strategy
 At the same time, the Democrats' strategy for the 1992 campaign, with its relentless emphasis on domestic issues, carries the risk of making the national party seem irrelevant when a crisis erupts in the Middle East or the Soviet Union. "World events can eliminate the premise for their campaign," said Don Sipple, a Republican consultant. "In a vacuum, their strategy sounds fine, but campaigns don't occur in a vacuum."
Presidential elections may, indeed, be driven by pocketbook issues and homefront concerns, as strategists for the Democratic National Committee say over and over again. And polls show that such issues, particularly the economy, rank at or near the top of the voters' concerns.
But last's week's events highlighted what Representative Stephen J. Solarz of Brooklyn and other centrist Democrats have been warning their party about in recent months: Voters must be satisfied that a party's nominee passes the threshold test of the Presidency and seems an effective Commander in Chief.
"We are not likely to win the 1992 Presidential election on foreign policy," Mr. Solarz told Democrats in New Hampshire recently. "But we could very easily lose the Presidential election on foreign policy."
Michael McCurry, a former spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said: "There were some Democrats deluding themselves into thinking that domestic policy alone would produce a victory. This has got to remind them that you have to have a world view."
There is another, chilling thought taking hold among some Democrats: By their actions, some of the party's leaders seem willing to take a pass on 1992 and then reassert their Presidential ambitions in 1996. But after a fourth consecutive Presidential defeat, after losing six of the last seven Presidential elections, how much long-term damage would the party incur? Already, polls show an ominous trend for the Democrats as a Presidential party, with voters age 18 to 29, who have only Jimmy Carter in their memories as a Democratic President, identifying more and more as Republicans.
"It's not good over the long term for Democrats to have overwhelming strong support for Bush among younger voters," Ms. Lake said, noting that political habits formed in youth can linger a very long time.
Martin Wattenberg, a professor of political science at the University of California at Irvine, believes that the Republican leanings of the young are exaggerated, but he sees the Democrats seriously hurt by having so much of their strength concentrated among the oldest voters.
"The people who are dying are the people who are Democrats," he said. "They grew up in the New Deal."
 
The Party Yearns
 With these kinds of trends, Democrats yearn for candidates to put their party first, enter the fray and simply fill the role of an aggressive, competitive loyal opposition in 1992.
"What is it about our times and our leadership on the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights that causes our party to be so devoid of direction?" asked George Bruno, a member of the Democratic National Committee from New Hampshire. "It's five months before the New Hampshire primary and there's one announced candidate. The situation is deplorable."
Paul E. Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts, is the only official major candidate for the nomination. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, emerging as the standard-bearer for the Democratic centrists, is still testing the waters, as is Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, campaigning as the unabashed voice of traditional liberalism. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia is also pondering a race. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, Washington's elected lobbyist to the Senate, says he has not yet decided whether to run.
The difficulty for the Democrats with this field, some Republicans assert, is simply a stature gap, driven home when the Soviet crisis and other international events cast Mr. Bush in the nation's consciousness, night after night, as a world leader.
"Keep in mind what the job is -- the job is being President," said Bob Teeter, Mr. Bush's political adviser. "The fact is the Democrats have a problem this year, in that they don't have anybody on the candidate list or the potential candidate list who has any experience in the conduct of foreign policy."
 
Replay of 1988?
 The Republicans were exceedingly skillful in the 1988 campaign in casting Michael S. Dukakis, who was the Governor of Massachusetts, as too untested, too risky and too weak to put at the helm of foreign policy. They seem intent on a devastating replay in 1992: The Soviet crisis "points out to the American public that foreign policy crises do not happen once a decade; they can happen with increasing frequency," said Clayton K. Yeutter, chairman of the Republican National Committee. "And it's important to have someone in charge who can handle them skillfully."
Some Democrats comforted themselves with the notion that the Soviet crisis came early in the Presidential campaign cycle and ended with a victory for the forces of change. Paul Tully, political director for the Democratic National Committee, argued that it told voters something they already knew about Mr. Bush, about his interest and ability in foreign affairs, but would not change their sense of what was important in the 1992 campaign.
"There are substantial challenges the country faces," Mr. Tully said. "There are substantial concerns on people's minds. There are things to have an election about and people to contest it vigorously.'
But after Mr. Gore's withdrawal, and with Mr. Bush looming ever larger, some Democrats inevitably harbored hopes that some of their heavyweights, like Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, might reconsider.
"I'd like to see some of our major figures just gut up and do it," said John White, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee. "Of course, we've got a different kind of politician now. The driven guys with fire in the belly, like Hubert Humphrey and Lyndon, are gone."

HEADLINE: San Francisco Mayor in Tough Bid for Re-Election

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Swept into office in a landslide in 1987 and hailed as a hero after the earthquake two years later, Mayor Art Agnos now finds himself in a bruising campaign for re-election, blamed by a cranky electorate and four challengers for urban problems that will not go away.
Panhandlers seem to be multiplying on downtown street corners. There is litter by the curbs and graffiti on the buses. Polls show that residents of San Francisco are running out of patience with the homeless and that suburbanites consider this a dirty, dangerous city and are staying away. 
 In this environment, adversaries and friends have declared open season on Mr. Agnos, a former social worker and State Assemblyman who won with 70 percent of the vote in a runoff election four years ago. For weeks now, candidate forums have drawn standing-room-only crowds and the Mayor has been booed and taunted.
 
Relative Conservatives
 Two longtime opponents of the Mayor were the first to declare. They are Frank Jordan, a former police chief, and Tom Hsieh, (pronounced shay) a member of the Board of Supervisors and the first Chinese-American to run for mayor in a major city. The two men are relative conservatives in a place where the political spectrum runs from the center to the left.
But Mr. Agnos is also being challenged by people who supported him the last time around: Angela Alioto, a rookie supervisor and the daughter of an esteemed former Mayor, and Richard Hongisto, the city assessor and a perennial officeholder.
The only independent poll so far was done before Ms. Alioto entered the race so its results are inconclusive, except as a harbinger for Mr. Agnos. That poll, by The San Francisco Examiner and KRON-TV, showed the Mayor with 27 percent of the vote, Mr. Jordan with 22.9, Mr. Hongisto with 13.7, Mr. Hsieh with 10.8 and the rest undecided. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.
The election will be held Nov. 5, with a runoff of the top two finishers on Dec. 10, unless one candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote, which is considered unlikely.
 
Magnet for Frustration
 Mr. Agnos said he expected to be a magnet for frustration in the early stages of the race. But the Mayor said he believed that voters would come to realize that nobody could govern any better in these times of recession, Federal and state cutbacks and so many intractable urban problems.
"The social worker in me understands their frustration," said Mr. Agnos. "They need to ventilate about their anxieties and uncertainties."
Mr. Agnos's opponents hope to convert that frustration into votes, tapping the nostalgia of residents who widely believe that San Francisco used to be a paradise but is not anymore.
Ms. Alioto has used this tack most effectively. A member of one of the city's dynastic families, she declared her candidacy with her father, Joseph C. Alioto, by her side within sight of the historic North Beach church where she was baptized.
"The greatness of this city is its joie de vivre," said Ms. Alioto. "People have never been down and out like they are today. You can feel the lack of morale in the streets."
Ms. Alioto's entry into the race earlier this month scrambled the early betting line. Conventional wisdom had it that Mr. Agnos would struggle in the general election, face Mr. Jordan in a runoff and breeze to a second term, because San Franciscans are at heart a progressive lot and the former police chief is pitching tough policy on the homeless.
 
The More Serious Threat
 Now, Ms. Alioto is seen as the more serious threat, particularly in a runoff of likeminded liberals. A private poll, which prodded her entry into the race, shows her finishing a close second to Mr. Agnos in a general election.
The recurring subject on the campaign trail has been homelessness. At debates, where everyone has two minutes to speak, Mr. Agnos insists that his multiservice centers are an effective solution and that the homeless problem is not as bad as critics claim.
Jerry Roberts, the political editor for The San Francisco Chronicle, summarized the downfall of this approach. "By trumpeting his performance on the homeless issue as a model for the nation, Agnos is effectively asking voters to disbelieve what their own senses tell them is true," Mr. Roberts said.
In more leisurely formats, like neighborhood coffee klatches, Mr. Agnos does a better job of explaining his long-term goals. "This problem was 10 years in the making," the Mayor tells voters. "You can't fix it in 10 days."
The main criticism of the Mayor is that he has been too kind to the homeless, not forcing them from parks as other cities have done and urging restraint on the Police Department.
Mr. Hsieh and Mr. Jordan have accused Mr. Agnos of making San Francisco a magnet for the homeless with his hospitality. Even Mr. Hongisto, who stresses compassion, said that Mr. Agnos has demoralized the Police Department by insisting on a "hands-off policy even when the homeless are acting out."
 
Putting the Homeless to Work
 Mr. Jordan has been the most specific. He has proposed requiring that the homeless help out on public works projects, such as cleaning graffiti. He also urges that transients be screened for criminal records before they are admitted to shelters and that people sleeping on the street be jailed.
Ms. Alioto, so far, has chosen gentler rhetoric. The homeless are "somebody's children," she said. Ms. Alioto's quarrel with Mr. Agnos is that he has concentrated on new, large shelters and not pumped enough money into small, neighborhood programs that she says do a better job.
Another charge against Mr. Agnos, leveled most often by Mr. Hongisto, is that the Mayor has sold out to the Chamber of Commerce and other business interests, betraying the neighborhood groups that elected him, by supporting large-scale development. Mr. Hongisto harps on the Mayor's support of a ballot measure, which went down to defeat, that would have replaced Candlestick Park with a downtown baseball stadium.
 
Counter-Culture Bastion
 Mr. Hsieh and Mr. Jordan take the opposite tack, accusing the Mayor of discouraging investment in San Francisco by fostering the city's image as a counter-culture bastion, a place that makes life difficult for real estate developers. An article in the latest issue of Forbes magazine describes the "wacky economics that echo around San Francisco's City Hall," and both Mr. Hsieh and Mr. Jordan were quick to include the criticism in their campaign oratory.
Mr. Hsieh, an architect and an effective fund-raiser for both his own campaign and the national Democratic Party, blames Mr. Agnos for "chasing jobs out of town" by "opening the door to military deserters and vagrants." And Mr. Jordan calls the Mayor's countenance of huge anti-war demonstrations during the Persian Gulf war, when the rest of the nation was waving yellow ribbons, as an embarrassment.
Mr. Jordan is responsible for the campaign's most memorable handouts so far, a set of postcards that the candidate says tell a truer story than the ones in the tourist racks at Fisherman's Wharf.
Those are pretty, colored pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge enshrouded in fog, the cable cars cresting steep hillsides, the world's crookedest street banked in summer flowers. These are black-and-white shots of homeless people pushing shopping carts, shuttered libraries and vandalized cars.
"The Mayor won't be happy about these, I'm sure," Mr. Jordan said. "But he can't refute them. These are actual photos. This is San Francisco as the residents see it."

HEADLINE: Accord in Detroit Would Let Girls Attend All-Boy Schools

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 25

 BODY:
A tentative agreement has been reached to allow girls to attend three all-male public academies scheduled to open in the city this fall, according to a published report.
The academies will open for boys only this week but will accept applications from girls over the next two weeks under the agreement between the Detroit school board and civil rights groups that challenged the board's original males-only plan, The Detroit News reported today. 
 The American Civil Liberties Union and the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund challenged the proposed all-male academies, suing on behalf of two Detroit mothers with children in the public school system.
The separate academies are being created to combat the social and economic problems that disproportionately affect black males. Ninety percent of the school system's pupils are black.
Judge George E. Woods of Federal District Court ruled Aug. 15 that the male-only academies were unconstitutional and ordered the board and civil rights groups to reach a compromise to allow girls to attend the schools.
A tentative agreement was reached late last week and is to be considered by the board on Tuesday, The News said.
"We plan to comply with the court decision," the schools Superintendent, Deborah McGriff, told The News, "and it's going to work out to everybody's satfisfaction."
About 1,200 males applied for 560 slots in the three academies. It was unclear how many girls would be admitted, but none of the boys were to lose their places.
If the tentative agreement is approved, applications for girls will be available beginning Wednesday, with a Sept. 4 deadline. Girls would start classes on Sept. 9.
Howard Simon, executive director of the Michigan chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, told The News that the compromise was "good for the community."
"It's good for the school board and, most importantly, it's good for the male and female students," he said.

HEADLINE: The Missing Reform in Mexico

 BODY:
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari fumbled his own potential triumph in last week's Mexican mid-term elections.
President Salinas has enjoyed three years of spectacular success in building a modern Mexico. His policies have helped check inflation, reduce foreign debt and open much of the economy to wider competition. Negotiations are now under way for a free-trade agreement with the U.S. 
 Thanks to these achievements, Mr. Salinas and his Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, are considerably more popular than they were during the disputed Presidential elections three years ago.
Yet Mr. Salinas failed to turn the elections into the triumph they could easily have been. He seems less impassioned about democracy than he is about economic reform. That's a serious failing, endangering Mexico's international reputation and the permanence of its economic gains.
As long as anyone can remember, Mexican elections have been massively fraudulent. Thanks in part to Mr. Salinas's modest efforts, this one was probably less so. But the accusations of fresh electoral fraud are credible enough to give the regime an unnecessary black eye.
Problems began with a last-minute distribution of new voter credentials that may have short-changed opposition constituencies. Election day brought familiar charges of stuffed and stolen ballot boxes, barred poll-watchers, bullied voters and selective closing of polling places. Then came a suspicious delay in releasing computerized results. Now, any formal appeals will be reviewed by official bodies dominated by PRI allies and loyalists.
It is as traditional for Mexican opposition parties to cry fraud as it is for PRI operatives to perpetrate it. Understandably, opposition politicians are reluctant to explain their dramatic loss of support in more self-critical ways. And even if every fraud charge were true, that could change only a handful of results.
But given recent history and the built-in biases of the present electoral system, the burden of reform falls on the Salinas Government. Honest democratic competition is now the rule from the Arctic to Tierra del Fuego. Mexico, Cuba, Suriname and Guyana are the only exceptions. Mexico won't be able to remove itself from this shameful list until Mr. Salinas shows himself to be as serious about democracy as he is about economic reform.

HEADLINE: The Parties, After the Party

 BODY:
It will take months, even years, for the world to grasp fully the implications of the Soviet Union's most incredible week since the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917. But in all the turmoil, few events matched the drama of Mikhail Gorbachev's renunciation on Saturday of the Communist Party. And few events hold out as much promise for a true turn toward multi-party democracy.
By resigning as the party's chief and calling for the dissolution of its Central Committee, Mr. Gorbachev ratified the rebellious popular judgment on decades of Communist tyranny. Only the day before, he had loyally pleaded the party's cause; hooted down by the Russian Parliament, he abandoned overnight a lifetime's allegiance. His turnabout may enable him to stay on as symbolic head of state in a radically altered union. 
 As George Bush is already learning, it is far from clear who speaks for this new Soviet Union -- Mr. Gorbachev, or Boris Yeltsin, who has emerged as the dominant political figure. What is clear is that the Soviet Union is no longer a multi-ethnic empire dominated by the Communists and controlled from Moscow. And as the party collapses, so too do the impediments to political pluralism and regional autonomy. Already the Ukraine and the Baltic states want out and the list is growing.
This unraveling is happening so fast that there are only proximate answers to new questions. Who will manage the economy? And who will control the defense establishment? These are questions for Soviet citizens, freed now from the party's yoke, to decide. For this has been their revolution. The collapse of Communism was not brought about by Western military might, though years of patient NATO resolve played a big part. Nor was this revolt spawned at C.I.A. headquarters in McLean, Va.
What undid the Communist Party and Lenin's revolution was massive questioning of inherited ideas and the growing ascendancy of new and predominantly Western values. This, together with the market economy's promise of a more prosperous life, was what emboldened Soviet demonstrators to face tanks in Moscow.
Some hopes of the new revolutionaries may prove as impossible to realize as the dreams of universal justice that invigorated the original Communists. And it's true that the Soviet rebels and their leaders have tasted freedom only briefly, and that in good part thanks to Mr. Gorbachev.
Genuine democrats everywhere have learned that the essential corollary of majority rule is respect for minority rights, and that a multiplicity of factions is the best safeguard against single-party despotism. This is a lesson that enthusiastic Soviet recruits to the fledgling democratic order need, in their moment of euphoria, to weigh.

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Off 8.8% in July

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Spurred by a sharp rise in demand from domestic automobile makers, orders for American-made machine tools rose 8.8 percent in July from the previous month's level, according to a report scheduled to be released today by the industry's trade association.
Still, machine tool orders this year remain well below their 1990 levels. 
 The Association for Manufacturing Technology said July's increase, the second consecutive month-to-month rise, was a result of increased domestic orders for machine tools. In the last few months, high levels of orders from foreign customers are what had sustained the industry.
 
Lower Seven-Month Total
 The association's report for July showed that orders rose to $188 million in the month, from $172.9 million in June. But orders for the first seven months of the year remain 18 percent below the level of a year earlier, the association said. And the July figures were down 19.7 percent from those of July 1990.
Machine tools are used to cut or shape metal parts used in durable products like appliances, automobiles, aircraft and building components. The levels of orders and shipments of machine tools are considered an important indicator of the health of American industry.
"The modest rise in machine tool orders for the second month in a row, with improved domestic orders leading the way, is encouraging," said Albert W. Moore, president of the tool maker's association, which is based in McLean, Va.
 
Strength in Aerospace
 Machine tool companies said that the July upturn in domestic orders may be a sign that American car makers were retooling their assembly lines and preparing for new engine designs that require new machine tools. They also said they saw continued strength from aerospace companies, which have been ordering machine tools to assist in building the next generation of aircraft.
"Automotive and aerospace orders are still going strong," said William J. Fife, chairman of Giddings & Lewis Inc., a large machine tool company in Fond du Lac, Wis. "We're seeing more activity in orders for the third quarter than we did in the first quarter and second quarter."
But some analysts were unwilling to attribute the increase in July to a prolonged period of buying by automobile makers and appliance makers.
"Things are mixed, with some machine tool companies doing well and some machine tool companies suffering," said James Paper, an analyst with Kirkpatrick, Pettis, Smith, Polian, an investment banking firm in Omaha.
He contended that the American machine tool industry continues to be weakened by foreign competition, which now accounts for as much as 40 percent of domestic orders in some product categories.
"The imports continue to take market share," Mr. Paper said, "and the auto industry, while doing more ordering, has still not been ordering new machine tools in the quantities we would like to see. So I'm still very cautious."
The figures for July showed that domestic orders climbed 36.3 percent in the month from June's level. Meanwhile, orders from foreign customers -- which have been strong throughout the year -- dropped 42.9 percent in the month. Compared with July of last year, domestic orders fell 28.2 percent, while orders from foreign customers rose 69.2 percent.
 
Slight Rise in Shipments
 Machine tool shipments for July were up slightly, to $214.3 million, from June's $212.15 million. For the first seven months of the year, shipments were 19.6 percent below the level of the same period last year, and down 8.2 percent from July 1990.
Machine tool orders have been hurt during the recession because of troubles with car makers, who typically account for more than a third of the industry's new orders. Some analysts have suggested that increased orders from auto makers would help stimulate the machine tool industry for the rest of the year.
But the level of machine tool orders remains highly volatile, varying from one month to the next. Analysts have said that the overall pattern for the first half of the year has been weak, but most expect some strength during the fourth quarter and the early part of 1992.

HEADLINE: A Peril Reborn: Mercury in the Environment -- A special report.;
Ancient Hazards of Mercury Re-Emerge

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DULUTH, Minn.

 BODY:
Two decades after the Government thought the problem had been put to rest, mercury is accumulating in fish in thousands of lakes across the United States and Canada, poisoning wildlife and threatening human health.
Twenty states, including New York and Connecticut, have warned people to limit or eliminate from their diets fish they catch in certain lakes because of dangerous levels of mercury. Canadian scientists have found elevated levels of mercury in fish caught in 95 percent of the lakes tested in Ontario. 
 Scientists say the principal source of contamination is rain containing traces of mercury from coal-burning power plants, municipal incinerators and smelters. Other contamination comes from lake and ocean sediments previously polluted by mercury.
States and the Federal Government have taken almost no action to reduce releases of mercury, in part because recognition of the problem is recent -- and because Federal energy and state environmental policies are actually part of the problem.
 
Harm Comes to Animals
 There have been few studies of the extent to which Americans might have been harmed by mercury poisoning, and state health officials say there is no evidence yet of damage to human health in this country.
But mercury has been confirmed as the cause of deaths of panthers and loons in Florida and is suspected in the reproductive failures seen in eagles, minks, otters and other animals in the Great Lakes region. Contamination is generally not an issue for store-bought fish, which do not come from the lakes most affected, the authorities say.
"It's a very messy pollutant," said John Bachmann, an engineer in the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Air Quality. "It's a liquid metal that becomes a gas even at mild temperatures. That makes it difficult to control. We need to know more."
But state environmental officials and a top Government mercury researcher disagree, saying that enough is known to begin halting mercury's spread. Delays, they say, are a result not of inadequate information but of conflicts.
Federal energy policy encourages power plants that burn coal, which contains small amounts of mercury. Meanwhile, the states, faced with dwindling landfill space, are encouraging construction of incinerators. Since mercury is used to make batteries, paints, electrical switches and hundreds of other products, incineration of these discarded items releases mercury.
"Solving this problem means changing our ways and spending money to control emissions -- a lot of money," said Dr. Gary Glass, a chemist at the E.P.A. Environmental Research Laboratory here who is a leading Government researcher and has been studying mercury since 1987 with state support. "It's going to take a very focused effort to cut back on consumer products that contain mercury."
The Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for utilities, estimated that power plants with equipment to remove mercury from emissions could cost $5 billion nationally. Incinerator builders say curbing mercury emissions could cost $10 million to $30 million per plant.
Some steps, much less costly, are being taken. Disposal methods that keep discarded batteries and paint from incinerators help reduce mercury in the atmosphere. Battery manufacturers, concerned about possible new regulations, have cut the use of mercury to 250 tons in 1989, from almost 1,200 tons in 1984, the E.P.A. says. Last year, the agency outlawed mercury in interior latex paints.
But there are still hundreds of millions of batteries, and many old paint cans. And wood that has been covered with latex paint containing mercury still emits mercury when burned.
 
From the Earth
Ancient Gift,
Ancient Peril
 Mercury has been a valuable raw material from the earth's crust for 3,500 years and a recognized hazard for nearly as long. Romans used the bright red sulfide ore of mercury for pigments, and at least one Roman naturalist, Pliny, described how mercury miners died in large numbers.
In the 19th century, fur that was used in the manufacture of felt hats was dipped in mercuric nitrate solution. Many felt workers absorbed so much mercury through their skin that they became known for slurred speech and uncontrollable shaking.
In the 20th century, mercury's disinfecting ability make it indispensable to the paper and paint industry in controlling slimes and molds. Chemical companies incorporate mercury in some reactions as a catalyst. Historically, industrial plants poured their mercury waste into rivers or lakes, where it collected in sediments and passed up the food chain, from plankton to minnows to large fish to birds of prey and large mammals -- and human beings.
 
Tragedy in Japan
 In the 1950's and early 1960's, more than 100 people developed tremors, fell into comas and died in Minamata, Japan. Fish caught in Minamata Bay had mercury levels that measured an average of 11 one-thousandths of a gram for every kilogram (2.2 pounds), comparable to a speck of pepper on a 36-ounce steak. The F.D.A. considers eating a single meal of fish containing one-thousandth of a gram of mercury per kilogram to be dangerous, and bars commercial sales of fish that have more.
The events in Minamata spurred a global investigation that yielded evidence in the 1960's of rising mercury levels in game fish caught in American waters. In 1972, Congress passed the Clean Water Act, requiring paper companies, smelters, paint factories and other plants to install equipment and prevent mercury from being released into water.
Before the law, Minnesota sampled its rivers and found adult fish containing a mean mercury level of about one-thousandth of a gram per kilogram in their flesh -- the amount judged by the F.D.A. to be too dangerous. By the late 1970's the mean mercury levels in fish taken in Minnesota rivers dropped to 0.38 thousandths of a gram per kilogram, a level then considered safe.
But prompted by reports from Sweden of persistent and widespread mercury contamination in fish caught in remote lakes in that country, the Minnesota Department of Health in the 1970's began sampling the state's lakes, particularly those along the wild border with Canada. In 1978, the agency identified mercury at levels of more than one-thousandth of a gram per kilogram in large walleye and northern pike caught in Crane Lake, 130 miles north of here and miles from any industry. The discovery prompted sampling by scientists in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and in Ontario, which turned up similarly high levels and spurred renewed efforts to identify the sources.
 
From the Skies
Not So Gentle
Falls the Rain
 Scientists now believe they know the culprits. They say mercury is being swept into the upper atmosphere from cement and phosphate plants as well as power plants and incinerators. Mercury also is evaporating from contaminated lake and ocean sediments and falling back to earth as toxic rain.
"There is a lot of very nasty, unpleasant stuff in rain coming at us from everywhere," said Dr. Terry A. Haines, a fishery research biologist for the United States Fish And Wildlife Service in Maine who has documented evidence of fish contaminated with mercury in the wilds of that state.
Eliminating mercury and the other compounds from rain is an enormous technical and political problem. For one thing, like the air pollutants that cause acid rain, mercury is released into the atmosphere hundreds of miles from where it is doing the most damage. How far mercury can travel is not known, but in its gaseous form it can linger in the atmosphere up to two years before it falls back to earth.
Swedish scientists estimate that 930 tons of mercury is circulating in the world's atmosphere at any time, enough to taint rain at levels that average 10 to 50 parts per trillion. That amount, while minuscule, is enough to cause problems.
In each of the last two years, the Minnesota Legislature rejected legislation that would have made it the first state to enact strict controls on mercury emissions. Industry argued that it would increase the cost of doing business without lowering mercury levels in fish, since most of the mercury falling on Minnesota was coming from outside the state.
"In a sense, they're right," said Willard Munger, the chairman of the state House Environment and Natural Resources Committee, who proposed the measure. "It's going to take national legislation to solve this problem. But we have to start somewhere."
 
How Safe?
Tainted Fish
In the Wilds
 Crane Lake in northern Minnesota is a stepping-off point to one of the largest wilderness regions left in the continental United States. Packs of timber wolves roam the pine forests, otters sun themselves on the rocky shoreline, bears forage for berries and eagles soar across blue skies.
Yet studies by Dr. Glass, and his colleague, Dr. George R. Rapp Jr., a researcher at the University of Minnesota in Duluth, have found that mercury levels in large adult walleye and northern pike from Crane Lake range from 0.9 to 1.1 thousandths of a gram per kilogram, and that they are rising 3 percent to 5 percent a year. Younger, smaller fish have less mercury.
The Minnesota Department of Health has set a limit for mercury in fish, 0.16 thousandths of a gram per kilogram, that is thought to be the nation's strictest. New York's limit is one-thousandth of a gram per kilogram, the same as the F.D.A.'s.
In almost every case, walleye and pike, even young fish 5 inches to 15 inches long, that are caught in Crane Lake and in neighboring Sand Point Lake exceed the state limit. The Minnesota Department of Health has warned Crane Lake anglers not to eat more than one eight-ounce serving of pike or walleye a week. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, women thinking of becoming pregnant, and children under the age of 6 are advised against eating any fish.
 
Harmless to Visitors
 Businessmen and lodge owners from Crane Lake say the limits are so stringent that they may ruin summertime lodging and fishing. Large fish are recognized as having the most mercury and they are rarely eaten, say homeowners and fishing guides. But smaller fish are staples of the meals that guides prepare, and the guides say they are harmless, especially to visitors who spend only a few days in the region.
"I've been eating fish here my whole life, and I'm fine," said Arthur (Butch) Eggen, a 38-year-old fishing guide. "The small fish aren't going to hurt you."
But businessmen recognize that rising levels of mercury in fish in Northern Minnesota lakes represents an economic problem, especially if people conclude that families seeking refuge from citys pollution face a greater risk of exposure to a dangerous toxic compound while on their vacations.
"We just have to tell people who come here what we know," said David K. Dill, the economic development director in Orr, 28 miles southwest of Crane Lake. "Yes, mercury is here. Yes, it's in the fish. But nobody in Minnesota has ever been diagnosed with mercury poisoning. And as far as the local people are concerned, it's a pressing issue only because if people get scared and go someplace else, it's pressing our pocketbooks."
 
What to Do?
Why Solutions
Are Elusive
 Perhaps most distressing about mercury pollution, say scientists, is that even if every industrial source of mercury was shut down today, the problem could get worse in some areas before it gets better.
First, more than 100 years of reliance on mercury has helped to produce some 45 million tons in the soil, the oceans, the sediment of lakes and rivers and the atmosphere. Second, scientists have found that other pollutants affect how mercury behaves.
Mercury is most dangerous when it is converted in the environment from its elemental form to methyl mercury, the organic form readily absorbed by fish. One of the disturbing recent findings is that acid in lakes and in clouds, and ozone pollution from cars and power plants, more quickly converts elemental mercury to methyl mercury. Environmental agencies in Minnesota, Wisconsin and New York have noted that the highest levels of mercury were found in fish taken from the most acidified lakes.
Thomas C. Jorling, the Commissioner of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, said mercury contamination "can't be solved by one state acting alone, which makes it an appropriate place for the Federal Government to act."
The Edison Electric Institute estimates that the amount of mercury released from burning coal in the United States each year is 100 tons, a small fraction of the 3,000 to 5,000 tons of mercury that pours into the atmosphere from burning coal around the world. The group argues that, like the destruction of the earth's ozone shield, the mercury problem will be solved only by an international treaty.
"Maybe we'll decide to go to new ways of generating power," said Dr. Donald B. Porcella, an ecologist at the Electric Power Research Institute, the utility industry's research arm. "Maybe we'll put more controls on incinerators. Maybe we'll cut back on using, or even eliminating mercury in industry. But its a very complicated problem, and we better understand it before we start making decisions."

Fillets of a fish caught there were examined by an angler. (Photographs by Jack Rendulich for The New York Times) (pg. B5)
 
Diagram: "Mercury in the Environment"
 
Mercury is a stable, naturally occurring element that is highly toxic and forms a variety of compounds. Here is how mercury circulates through the environment, and estimates of how much is present or produced.
 
Natural Sources: Emissions estimates range from 3,000 to 20,000 tons a year. Volcanoes are one major source; mineral ores that give off mercury are common in the earth's crust.
 
Industrial sources: Emit up to 21,000 tons a year. Mining is the biggest source; others include burning of oil and coal; metal smelting; steel and cement making; incineration of batteries, paint and other products made with mercury.
 
Atmosphere: Contains up to 930 tons at any one time. Once they reach the upper atmosphere, mercury compounds remain suspended for up to two years.
 
Toxic rain: Rain and snow carry mercury back to earth. Acid rain promotes formation of methyl mercury, the form most readily absorbed by fish and wildlife.
 
Soil: No estimate. Mercury reaches soil from dumping of solid and liquid waste, and from tainted rain and snow.
 
Water: Lakes and rivers contain up to 2,200 tons; the oceans contain more than 45 million tons. Methyl mercury is formed and is readily absorbed by fish.
 
Sediments: No estimate. Mercury compounds collect in lake, river and ocean sediments and, when disturbed by dredging, release mercury back into the water. (Source: Environmental Protection Agency) (pg. B5)

HEADLINE: Using Credit Cards, Students Learn a Hard Lesson

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
As a freshman at the University of Houston, Alicia Perez signed up for classes and, in the cafeteria, for credit cards. She had no job and no credit history, but she soon had three Visa cards, a Sears card, a Discover card, two gasoline company cards and a local department store card.
Today, Ms. Perez, a junior, has no cards but $6,800 worth of credit card debt. 
 "For some reason, I just got out of control," said Ms. Perez, 21 years old. "I used the cards to pay for meals, buy compact discs, or if I saw something in the mall."
More than half of the nation's 5.6 million full-time four-year college students will be taking credit cards to school this fall along with their books and bedding, says Credit Card News, a bimonthly trade newsletter published in Chicago.
And for those students who do not yet have any, companies that offer cards will do everything in their power to see that the students acquire them. Among the measures some will take are setting up solicitation tables on campuses, providing incentive gifts, like the dictionary that Ms. Perez got when she signed up for a package of six cards, and waiving some of the usual requirements, like credit histories, income requirements or parental signatures.
The credit card companies are aiming at college students because they are a growing new market, with 3.68 million spenders having brought the major card issuers at least $3.5 billion in 1990, according to an estimate by Credit Card News. While this is only about 1 percent of the $341.8 billion that was charged in 1990 in the United States, it represents the future. The rest of the market is saturated, with the average non-student cardholder owning seven cards.
 
'Somewhat More Responsible'
 Susan Weeks, a spokeswoman for Citicorp, the nation's largest issuer of credit cards, said college students are good customers. "We've found that they are somewhat more responsible than our other customers," she said. "And student delinquency rates are less than those of the general population."
Asked if that was because parents were paying the bills for their children, Ms. Weeks said, "We don't have a co-signer on the card, so it's the person who takes out the card who has legal responsibility for it."
Among those who see some advantage in extending credit to students are the students themselves. Some campus organizations that help sign up cardholders say it can be valuable for students to establish credit.
But many outside the credit card industry are far less enthusiastic about the expanding market among students. Financial counselors at colleges and universities across the country say they are finding that more and more students are using cards to cover rent, groceries and other necessities, especially as the recession squeezes family incomes, and that the students are establishing bad credit records.
And increasing numbers of parents, credit counselors, financial aid officers and students worry that the practice is creating a new generation of debt addicts.
"Students are saying that they should get credit cards now because it is easier than when they graduate," said Flora Williams, an associate professor in family economics and financial counseling at Purdue University. "And it is, because the credit card companies know that the parents are going to pay the bills or bail the kid out if he gets in trouble."
Those whose parents can not or will not bail them out are turning to counseling agencies, like the not-for-profit Consumer Credit Counseling Services. The 621 such agencies across the country help consumers work out payment schedules with creditors. Ms. Perez took this route, as did Ralph (Tip) Fishburn, a senior at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va.
 
Straightening Out Priorities
 "I just had all my priorities screwed up," said Mr. Fishburn, 28. "I went into college straight out of high school, flunked out, worked for a while as a bicycle courier and then in 1987 went back to school. I had a virgin Mastercard with a $1,500 credit limit. I promptly put $1,200 worth of tuition on it."
No longer working as a courier, but in the school's cafeteria, Mr. Fishburn said, his income shrank precipitously. But not his credit habit.
"I didn't have any parents backing me up," he said. "I'd taken out a couple of school loans as well, and the slide just started."
Anne Swift, an associate professor at the Financial Counseling Clinic at Iowa State University, said students who are referred to her clinic often use credit cards to pay for gasoline or for cash advances to pay rent or buy groceries.
 
'He's Maxed Out'
 "I've got one junior who works part time and goes to school full time and he's $8,000 in debt," Ms. Swift said. "He's got a loan and a Pell Grant and he's maxed out his credit cards. You can't automatically say drop out, get a job, pay everything off and then come back to school, because six months out of school the student has to start paying back his school loan."
Paying off credit card bills is an expensive proposition. Last year the average cost of financing purchases on a standard fixed-rate Visa card or Mastercard was 18.86 percent.
Fred Waddell, a family resource management specialist at Auburn University, said increasing numbers of students were coming for counseling about their troubles with credit cards. "It's reached a serious proportion in terms of the students here who not only use credit cards indiscriminately but who write checks on credit cards which then bounce," he said.
Mr. Waddell said: " There's hardly a university student today who isn't receiving many solicitations. I have some real reservations about that." "
Some universities or national student organizations participate in "affinity" programs in which banks make credit cards available in bulk to special interest groups and then pay royalties to the groups for every dollar charged by the new cardholders they sign up.
"We find that it's very important for students to have credit," said Pierre Barolette of the United States Student Association, which has an affinity card program with MBNA, a bank in Delaware. "It's important that students begin a credit history."
But some worry about the implications of such trends for the attitudes of the young people.
Dr. Williams at Purdue said that credit card companies are no longer using the rigorous standards they once set in issuing cards and that the young people are not learning how to handle them responsibly.
"Students are getting credit when they don't meet the requirements for credit: capital, character and collateral," Dr. Williams said. "They look at credit as a resource, not as what it is, a debt."
Oliver Love, a 19-year-old freshman at Illinois State University, is one who has so far resisted the temptation to acquire a credit card. Mr. Love said he marched right by a solicitation table that was set up outside the school's bookstore in his first week on campus. "I've just seen them abused, and I don't need to feel like an adult yet."
Kurt T. Peters, editor of Credit Card News, said the card companies' turning to college students had increased "dramatically over the last five years."
"The rationale for card issuers is very obvious," he said. "They're hoping to establish students as customers, when the students are at a stage of forming brand loyalties. And cards are so profitable that they're willing to take certain risks."
 
Cardholders of the Future
 And there is increasing interest in the younger teen-age population in owning credit cards. Peter Zollo, president of Teen-age Research Unlimited in Northbrook, Ill., recently completed a survey of 2,000 students 15 to 19 years old to determine how many wanted credit cards in their own names. Of the 15-year-olds surveyed, 52 percent said they wanted cards in their own names; 45 percent of the 16-to-17-year-olds said so; and 37 percent of the 18- and 19-year-olds said so.
"The more sophisticated they are, the more they realize there is a bill to pay," Mr. Zollo said. "They know there is some danger as far as credit."
It is a danger that Ms. Perez and Mr. Fishburn know well. Ms. Perez says she believes credit cards should be more difficult for students to obtain. Mr. Fishburn says credit card companies should do more to educate college-age consumers about how to use cards.
And neither is going to be charging anything soon. The first thing they agreed to do in their counseling sessions was to turn in their credit cards.
"Even cards I hadn't run amuck on, I turned in," said Mr. Fishburn, who has $3,500 still to pay. "Maybe someday down the road I'll get another one, but one with a very small credit limit."

Chart: "Credit Card Abuse: Some Symptoms"
A financial counselor, Beverly Richardson, of Fort Bend County, Tex., said parents and students can look for these signs of credit card abuse:
 
 Students have more than one credit card and one charge card that must be paid in full each month.
Card payments prevent regular payment of rent, utilities or car loans.
Cash advances or checks written on one credit card are used to make payments on another.
Balances are at the credit limit, making them unavailable for emergencies.
Credit is used to pay for meals with friends who reimburse in cash, which is then regarded as "found" money. (pg. A17)

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL: SOVIETS' RUSH TOWARD DISUNION SPREADS; EUROPE EMBRACING BALTIC INDEPENDENCE;
3 NORDIC LANDS ACT

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TALLINN, Estonia, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Three Nordic countries became the first today to recognize the secession of the Baltic republics from the Soviet Union, paving the way for the rest of Europe to embrace Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as sovereign equals.
Denmark, Norway and Finland informed the three Baltic governments that they had extended recognition and stood ready to establish diplomatic relations immediately, and Argentina followed with a similar announcement. Iceland said it would do so on Monday, and Japan said it would recognize the sovereignty of the republics when Moscow does.
 
Bonn Wants Speedy Action
 At the same time, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of Germany invited the Baltic foreign ministers to Bonn this week and said in a radio interview, "I will propose that we decide to establish diplomatic relations." 
 The Bush Administration expects the Soviet Union to free the Baltic republics as early as Monday and is prepared to respond immediately by giving them official recognition. American officials said. By waiting for the Soviet move, President Bush raised the danger that he would end up following the lead of European governments. [Page A13.]
Here in Tallinn, such political considerations did little to mar a sense of exhilaration. "It's a fantastic day," said Toivo Klaar, an Estonian foreign affairs official, spreading before a visitor the faxed messages his office received from governments ready to recognize the secession of the Baltic republics or who are considering such action.
 
European Community Session
 The flurry of diplomatic welcomes followed by a day the issuance of two decrees by Boris N. Yeltsin, declaring that his Russian federated republic recognized the independence of Estonia and Latvia. Russia had earlier endorsed Lithuania's claim.
The European Community announced today that its 12 foreign ministers would meet in the next few days and that a common policy on granting recognition would be discussed at this special session. Denmark, which had urged such action, decided not to await the decision of the other community members.
A letter by the Danish Foreign Minister, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, received here today, greeted Estonia's declaration of independence with "a profound sense of joy and relief."
Lithuania, moving to add substance to its own declaration of independence, which it first asserted in the winter of 1989-90, announced that it would take full control of its borders on Monday. It will also take over the issuing of visas, which are now given by the Soviet authorities. There has been no Soviet comment on these statements.
From Riga, it was reported that Latvia planned to take similar action soon. The Estonian cabinet met today and decided to send Premier Edgar Savisaar and Interior Minister Olev Laanjarv to Moscow on Tuesday to discuss the issue with officials of the Soviet Interior Ministry.
In another action, the cabinet decided to urge Parliament on Monday to dissolve the municipal councils of three cities near its northeastern border with the Russian federation because they supported the Moscow coup. The bulk of Estonia's Russian population, the result of Stalin's policy of Russifying the Baltic lands, lives in the northeastern industrial region.
 
Ethnic Russians in Estonia
 The area is under the control of hard-line Communists, who have opposed not only the independence of Estonia but also Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies of democratization throughout the Soviet Union. About 30 percent of Estonia's population of 1.6 million consists of ethnic Russians.
The foreign ministers of the three Baltic states arrived in Reykjavik today, where Icelandic officials said they were prepared to sign an agreement on Monday establishing diplomatic ties.
From there, the officials will go on to Oslo to sign similar accords, Mr. Klaar said. Still later in the day, they will proceed to Bonn on the invitation of Mr. Genscher to discuss diplomatic relations with Germany.
The three Baltic lands were annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, after conclusion of a secret protocol to the 1939 nonaggression treaty between Stalin and Hitler. They were occupied by Germany in 1941, in the first stages of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. In the closing months of World War II, the Red Army ousted the German forces.
 
Great Postwar Suffering
 The process of Sovietization that followed in the next few years took an appalling toll of Baltic victims, as Stalin reasserted Moscow's authority. Tens of thousands joined those who had already disappeared into Soviet prison camps before the German conquest. Many never returned.
Although most Western nations, including the United States, never extended recognition to the Soviet annexation, their reluctance until now to do more than give verbal and moral support have disappointed Estonians, Lithuanians and Latvians. This has been particularly true in Lithuania, which was the first of the three to formally declare independence.
Latvia and Estonia took that same legalistic step only last week, once the Communist hard-liners' coup failed.
Even then, Baltic hopes of virtually immediate Western recognition were thwarted as Western foreign ministries tried to find out exactly how power was shifting in Moscow and throughout the Soviet Union.
Mr. Meri noted that just over a week ago, he had been told by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain, in a phone conversation, that Estonia did not meet the criterion of being in control of its territory and borders.
 
British Think Again
 The acceleration of events in Moscow appeared to have caused a rethinking that led to the actions of the Nordic nations today. It also caused London to announce that a Foreign Office Minister, Douglas Hogg, would soon visit the three Baltic lands to study the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations.
In Copenhagen, it was reported that Denmark might dispatch a senior diplomat to Latvia as early as Monday to serve as ambassador to the three republics.

HEADLINE: School Boards Reach Out To Elderly for Support

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Each year in the Riverside school district in New Jersey, the elderly converge on the schools for Senior Citizens Day. They sample food from the cafeterias, watch students sing and dance and learn about the academic programs being financed with their tax dollars.
In Westchester County in New York, the Pelham schools have begun issuing gold cards that give the elderly there free entry to all sports events, while in nearby North Tarrytown members of the Board of Education visit groups of older people during the budget season to assure them that the fat is being trimmed from the budget. 
 Across the New York metropolitan region, school officials, some of whom faced heated school budget votes earlier this year, have begun soft-sell campaigns aimed at older residents, a growing voting bloc that has at times been ignored because its members have no children of school age.
And in doing so, the educators have taken to offering not only school dances, special days and free admission to school events, but also -- as in one district -- to lobbying state officials for property-tax relief for the elderly.
 
Budget Support Waning
 "We're going to have more and more people living in local communities without children in school," said Dr. Richard Lerer, Superintendent of the Southern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services, a statewide net work created by the Legislature to serve local school districts. "It becomes critical therefore for school districts to understand this phenomenon and to inform and involve these people."
This past spring in New Jersey, only 55 percent of the school budgets in some 600 districts were approved, while in New York State the approval rate slipped to 72 percent, one of the lowest in 11 years, the New York State School Boards Association reported. In 1984, the board noted, nearly 90 percent of the New York budgets were approved.
In Connecticut, residents do not vote on school budgets.
Educators attribute the poor approval rate primarily to general frustration over high taxes and the hard times wrought by the recession. But in some communities with large elderly populations, the vote of older people was also cited as a factor.
"They are a powerful voting bloc," said Betsey Hardeman, deputy superintendent of the Tarrytowns district. "The senior citizens are not necessarily negative about the schools, but really believe that they cannot afford to pay higher taxes -- whether state, county, local or school taxes. The only place they can show dissatisfaction is in the school budget vote."
 
Elderly Population Growing
 Educators say that with the elderly population growing -- Westchester's has grown 36 percent in the last 20 years, for example -- schools can no longer afford to ignore them. The educators say that while many of the programs are not necessarily planned to convince the elderly to vote for school budgets, they could have that affect nonetheless.
Julie Peacox, the board president in the Tarrytowns school district, is lobbying legislators in Albany for property-tax relief for 500 residents who are more than 65 years old. "If they can get tax relief, which they deserve, they will be more willing to say yes on a school budget, since the budget comes out of property taxes," she said.
The Hopewell Valley Regional School District in New Jersey, which suffered budget defeats in the last two years, holds monthly luncheons for older people, as well as a Valentine's Day dance.
Linda Maiden, a district spokeswoman, said the district did not use the programs as a "sales pitch or forum," although, she noted, "I did say at the luncheon before the last election that I hoped everybody would vote."
"They are important taxpayers, and we want to thank them for being part of our school community," she said.
Only a handful of states hold annual school-budget elections, according to the Education Commission of the States, a research organization in Denver. Most school boards have the power to determine their budgets themselves, but within a formula set by the state that keeps a lid on increases.
As a result, the only time school boards in most states run into voter resistance is when there are special bond issues for new school buildings or major renovations; these must go to voters for approval. And in states with large retirement communities, like Arizona, the obstacles from older voters can be enormous.
 
Bloc Voting Hurts
 In Chandler, Ariz., 18 miles southeast of Phoenix, the residents of Sun Lake, a large retirement complex, have battled the Chandler Unified School District. The district, looking for ways to get its message across, has been denied access to the retirement community's newspaper and television station.
"At first, it didn't really affect the district, because their voting bloc wasn't that large," said Dr. Howard K. Conley, the Schools Superintendent. "But now they can generate 3,000 to 5,000 votes for any issue that comes up, and these votes come in at least 90 percent no. So you have a rather difficult mountain to climb."
The American Assocation of Retired Persons, a lobby and service organization in Washington, says that, on the whole, its 33 million members do support public education. "Our experience is that the opponents are a vocal minority and that most older people do support the education of their children and their children's children," said Ted Bobrow, a spokesman.
Nonetheless some school districts have found themselves at odds with a growing group that lives on fixed incomes and is deeply concerned about rising taxes.
 
Ties to Pupils Encouraged
 Educators have used all sorts of programs to get the elderly involved in the school districts. In the East Islip school district on Long Island, a foster-grandparenting program for young children who are considered to be at risk is entering its fourth year.
About two dozen residents of the district, ranging in age from 60 to 86, "adopt" students with family troubles in elementary school and give the children emotional support and positive feedback. The program is operated by Foster Grandparents Inc. of Suffolk County, an agency of United Way.
Though the program's main purpose is to help the youngsters, school officials say that any gain in support for the schools by the elderly is a "serendipitous" outcome.
In the Connetquot Central School District, which draws 7,800 students from Oakdale, Bohemia and Ronkonkoma on Long Island, there is a pen-pal program between English students in the junior high school and elderly citizens. Begun three years ago, the correspondence culminates in the spring with a breakfast at which the writers meet one another.
In addition, students in all plays and musicals give one free performance just for the elderly, and every year the board names a "senior citizen of the year."
"I feel strongly that we're all going to be senior citizens one day, but it's also good public relations," said Schools Superintendent John S. Maloney. "If they know what's going on in our schools, they will vote for the budget and hopefully vote positively."
 
Retirement Communities Wooed
 In Lakewood, N.J., which has a few retirement communities, school officials work closely with retired people. Leisure Village, the largest of the communities, has appointed a liaison to the Board of Education and has held candidates' nights before board elections. School district officials, in turn, have sent representatives to discuss the budget process with the elderly.
"We spent a lot of time going to the senior-citizen community this year," said Evelyn Feigin, president of the Lakewood board. "We presented our budget and explained things. We're trying to gain their trust and show that we are making an effort to keep spending down."
In all but one of the last 10 years, however, the budget has failed to win approval. "The elderly consistently defeat the budget," Mrs. Feigin said. And yet school officials direct their resentment not at the elderly, but at the parents with children in school who do not vote.
"We have 5,000 children in Lakewood schools, and if the parents would come out to vote, they have more than enough votes to offset the elderly vote," Mrs. Feigin said.
Whether the efforts to woo older people will pay off remains to be seen. Rose DeMilia, president of Tarrytown Seniors in Westchester County, said that her members were angry that the school budget was approved this year and that they were not interested in further contact with the schools.
"The school tax is too much, and the kids don't get much benefit," she said.
But Lidjia Tremper, a trustee at Leisure Village in Lakewood, said residents of her retirement community appreciated the school district's outreach.
"The board is very cooperative with us," Mrs. Tremper said. "We have asked them to keep the budget increases down to 5 percent. They're trying."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 31, 1991, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about programs to involve the elderly in school districts misstated the method of adopting school budgets in Connecticut. In most communities, they are included in municipal budgets and are not subject to a separate popular vote. But in regional school districts, the vote is separate.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Demand Up In Medical Technology

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
HOSPITAL industry executives say there are thousands of job openings across the country for technologists in medical imaging and radiation therapy. "We are desperately in need of people," said Howard W. Schwartz, senior administrative director of radiology at the University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinic in Minneapolis.
The supply of trained people has not kept up with the explosion in the use of medical technology, notably images generated by computerized X-ray scanners, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound devices, as well as radiation treatment for cancer patients. 
 The Labor Department forecasts continued strong demand: At least 70,000 more jobs for radiolologic technologists and technicians will be created by the end of the 1990's.
Despite the recession and cutbacks in New York health-care budgets, there are an estimated 1,000 unfilled jobs for radiologic technicians in the state, said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, operator of the New York Health Careers Center, which provides information about wages, job opportunities, educational requirements and scholarships in imaging, as well as other hospital job openings.
Mr. Raske said that in New York City radiologic technologists earn $26,000 to $28,000 a year. Diagnostic medical sonographers, who work with ultrasound, make $31,500, and radiation-therapy technologists, who work mainly with cancer patients, $36,000.
He said most hospitals were raising wages in these specialties by 10 percent annually to compete with higher offers from a rapidly growing number of independent imaging centers. James N. Heuerman, a partner at Korn/Ferry International, a health- care management recruiter, said technologists at some imaging centers earned $50,000 to $60,000 a year.
Nationally, the average pay scales are several thousand dollars lower than in New York, where living costs are high. Mr. Schwartz said that a Minneapolis ultrasound technician, for example, might earn $24,000 to $25,000, plus benefits. The American Medical Association publishes wage and school information in an annual Allied Health Education Directory.
Applicants for imaging jobs must have certificates or associate degrees from a one- or two-year training program. Some earn four-year college degrees. To be admitted to the training, students must have a high school diploma, or its equivalent, with classes in mathematics and science.
"It is a tremendous opportunity," said Barbara Bloom Kreml, director of the human resources department at the American Hospital Association. "They have the potential of studying for two years and coming out and making a good salary."
There were 672 radiography training programs in community colleges and hospitals last year, and most could have admitted more students. "Student spaces are going begging," Ms. Kreml said.
Mr. Schwartz said hospitals and radiologists became alarmed when the Labor Department predicted that the number of imaging jobs would increase by 66 percent between 1988 and 2000. "We had to do something," he added, because the supply of candidates was growing much more slowly. Indeed, the number of high school graduates was shrinking, and under budget constraints many schools curtailed career-counseling programs.
Physicians' professional groups, administrators and licensing boards in radiology, nuclear medicine, ultrasound and radiation therapy organized a consortium, the Summit on Manpower, to drum up interest in the school programs and job opportunities. The group sponsored public service radio and television announcements and is working on videotapes and high school science workbooks to describe the field.
The consortium also hopes to improve the status of imaging technicians in hospitals, which provide 90 percent of the jobs. "We used to call these jobs X-ray technicians," Ms. Kreml said. "Now they want to call them radiologic scientists." Mr. Schwartz said that another problem was to answer concerns about exposure to AIDS and other diseases in hospital work.
Some hospitals are broadening the possibilities for advancement, for example, by raising the pay of employees who learn to operate both X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging scanners. But Mr. Heuerman, the management recruiter, said the technicians, unless they also studied business administration, only rarely moved up into supervisory jobs.
Students and job counselors can call hospital personnel departments or contact the New York Health Careers Center, 555 West 57th Street, 15th floor, New York, N.Y. 10019, telephone (800) 365-1633, and the Summit on Manpower, 1825 K Street NW, Suite 210, Washington, D.C. 20006, telephone (800) 432-3247. The Allied Health Education Directory may be ordered from the American Medical Association, P.O. Box 2964, Milwaukee, Wis, 53201-2964.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Agencies Speed Up Plans To Expand in Soviet Market

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
THE collapse of Communism in the Soviet Union will bring a significant increase in the presence of United States advertising agencies there, industry executives said yesterday. Agencies already operating in the Soviet Union are looking to expand, while others are now considering opening offices.
Many of the largest United States shops have had Soviet operations since the late 1980's, when President Mikhail S. Gorbachev touched off experimentation with capitalism. But last week's stunning, rapid-fire sequence of events, which culminated with the rout of the Communist Party, could inspire companies to accelerate their plans. And where companies go, their agencies follow. 
 "The Soviet Union will now become a very interesting and exciting market," Wolfgang Slupetzky, regional director for Eastern Europe at Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, said in a telephone interview from his office in Vienna. "I see the first signs that a market economy will move in, and we are fully prepared to support this."
Ogilvy's office in Moscow, with a staff of 18 Soviet citizens, was opened "to give international clients services whenever they came into the Soviet Union," Mr. Slupetzky said. The idea was that "if more international business comes in, we would move more people into Moscow," he added, "and I see this coming now."
At Young & Rubicam/Sovero, Moscow, a joint venture of Young & Rubicam and the Soviet Union's largest agency, "we'd planned to add people as fast as we'd have a genuine need for them," said Bill Munsell, chief operating officer, who is in the United States on business.
As a result of growth earlier this year, he added, the agency had already hired three or four additional employees. That brings to 16 the total staff working on projects for clients like Colgate-Palmolive, Eastman Kodak and Johnson & Johnson.
Another reason to expand Soviet operations, Mr. Munsell said, would be to handle assignments from Soviet clients as state-owned companies are transformed into private enterprises. For one such concern in Moscow, the First Watch Company, Y.&R./Sovero is now gathering market and consumer research data, he added.
Market information is also on the mind of Roy Bostock, chairman and chief executive of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, New York, which employs eight Soviet citizens in its Moscow office. He said the managing director there, Sergei Koptev, had been meeting with "one of the key people from our London agency, to lay out the specifications for research into specific consumer segments."
"I am sure the number of focus groups conducted in the Soviet Union is going to triple in a matter of a couple of months," he added, referring to the consumer research interviews that are common in creating advertising in the United States.
In addition to stepped-up activity in DMB&B's Moscow office, the agency will call even more on its staff members at offices in Western Europe, Mr. Bostock said, asking them to lend expertise to Soviet projects.
The fast-moving Soviet changes are "an opportunity for our clients and for us," said Hank Feeley, chairman and chief executive of Leo Burnett International in Chicago, which has had no presence in the Soviet Union. Depending on client needs, he added, the agency might open an office there or offer services through existing Burnett offices.
Since the Berlin wall fell in 1989, Burnett has begun operations in three former East Bloc nations: Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. The Soviet Union "has been on the agenda," Mr. Feeley said, adding, "It has just been a matter of when it is right."

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
The Case Against Lower Inflation

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
FOR the first time since the late 1980's, inflation is clearly in decline. The most popular inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index, has fallen by more than a percentage point, to an annual rate of less than 3 percent, in the first seven months of 1991. Various other measures also show inflation to be edging down. And that raises the question, should the Government use its powers to push the inflation rate even lower? The consensus, for the moment, is no.
Economists offer three main reasons. First, trying to reduce inflation from its already relatively low level would come at a high cost in more unemployment and recession. Second, inflation is not a problem as long as prices rise each year by the same predictable percentage. When the inflation rate jumps around, the uncertainty about what prices will do next is disruptive. Or, as William Niskanen, chairman of the Cato Institute, put it: "A stable 4 percent inflation rate is better than an unstable zero rate that might soon rise." 
 Finally, pushing down the average inflation rate would be much harder on manufacturers than on service companies. Medical care fees, for example, are still rising at an 8.6 percent annual rate, but the General Electric Company could not make a recent price increase stick for its appliances and backtracked as sales fell. If the Government were to succeed in reducing the average inflation rate in this situation, doctors would probably still raise their fees, although not by as much as before, but manufacturers would have to cut prices. For them, the Government's strategy would be deflationary.
"You kill off profits when you do this, and with profits, new investment also goes, and that reduces potential economic growth," said Peter L. Bernstein, an economic consultant. "You never get the economy out of the woods."
The inflation-fighting process explains why manufacturers bear the brunt. The Government's main agent in fighting inflation is the Federal Reserve, which tries to keep interest rates high enough so that people will be discouraged from financing new refrigerators, cars or homes. The recession that began last July, with its weak demand and falling production, was a byproduct of this anti-inflation effort. But the impact is always uneven.
The demand for refrigerators, cars or houses, and therefore their prices, is much more affected by interest rates on loans than are medical fees or the prices of other services. Whatever the cost of borrowing, medical fees tend to get paid, although they rise. Health insurance, Medicaid and Medicare sustain the demand.
Some inflation, then, "greases the wheels of the economy" for manufacturers, and also for wage earners, said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist. Rising prices for gasoline or haircuts means that a $400-a-week wage can lose purchasing power without having to be cut from $400. With zero inflation, the same loss in purchasing power requires a wage cut and "people scream about cuts in their nominal wages," Professor Blinder noted.
Still, the case for pushing down the inflation rate to zero, or nearly zero, attracts many followers. They acknowledge, for example, that a 4 percent inflation rate would be no more damaging to the economy than a 1 percent annual rise -- if the 4 percent rate remained steady and predictable. But 4 percent inflation is, by definition, hard to maintain, they say, and is therefore unpredictable. For that reason, the anti-inflationists prefer to aim for zero inflation, which they say is easier to maintain than 4 percent. "Price-level stability, popularly called zero inflation, is superior to inflation-rate stability," W. Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, wrote recently.
Those who invest in Treasury securities and corporate bonds also tend to favor zero inflation, because inflation reduces the purchasing power of the money they have tied up in these securities. And then there is the argument that downward pressure on inflation forces companies to be more efficient and productive. If General Electric cannot raise refrigerator prices, it tries to preserve profit margins in the face of rising labor costs through automation, layoffs and new procedures.
Manufacturers generally respond more quickly than service companies to the anti-inflation prod, but lately the service sector, too, seems to be pushing for efficiencies, mostly through layoffs, as obtaining price increases becomes more difficult.
It is this behavior that demonstrates the problem in pushing inflation down too hard: Falling employment levels can prolong a recession or make a recovery very weak. "To achieve zero inflation," Paul R. Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in a recent article, "the Fed would probably have to engineer a recession that would keep the average rate of unemployment at 7.5 percent for the next five years."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Sluggish Trading in Dollar; Gold Prices Up Moderately

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed mixed in listless trading yesterday as investors evaluated events in the Soviet Union.
Gold prices rose modestly. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold closed at $355.20 an ounce, up $1.80 from late Friday. Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $355.25 an ounce, up $1.75. 
 Traders said there was little economic news to affect the dollar, and trading was also slow because the currency and precious metals markets in Britain and Hong Kong were closed because of holidays.
"People are just kind of taking a wait-and-see attitude on how the Russian situation settles down," said George Eckhardt, manager of foreign exchange at Paine Webber International.
The dollar initially surged last week on news of the Soviet coup, but it fell when the coup failed. The dollar is historically seen as a safe investment during international instability.
The dollar rose sharply on Friday after the Government's report on orders to factories for durable goods suggested an economic upturn.
In Tokyo yesterday, the dollar rose 0.32 yen, closing at 137.02. In European markets, it was quoted at 136.95 yen. In New York, it closed at 136.90 yen, unchanged from Friday.
In Europe, the British pound rose to $1.6775, from $1.6738 on Friday. In New York, a pound cost $1.6800, more expensive than $1.6775 late on Friday.
The dollar rose minimally against the German mark in New York, closing at 1.7480 marks, compared with 1.7475 on Friday.
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.5240 Swiss francs, down from 1.5275; 5.9365 French francs, up from 5.9345; 1,304.50 Italian lire, down from 1,304.75, and 1.1440 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14415.
In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $354.25 an ounce, up from $353.50 late on Friday.
Silver fell to $3.930 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange, from $3.936 late on Friday.

HEADLINE: Donald C. Platten, Ex-Chairman Of Chemical Bank, Is Dead at 72

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Donald C. Platten, chairman and chief executive of Chemical Bank from 1973 to 1984, died on Sunday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 72 years old and lived in Darien, Conn.
He died of lung cancer, his family said. 
 Chemical Bank was the only place Mr. Platten ever worked. He had nonpaying summer jobs there for two years while he was in college, and joined Chemical's credit department soon after he graduated from Princeton in 1940. His salary that first year was $1,300, nearly as much as he made in a single day 35 years later, when he was Chemical's top executive.
Mr. Platten specialized in philosophy at Princeton -- not economics "or an accounting course that gave me fits," he once said -- even though "I sort of knew I was going into business."
 
Moved Bank's Headquarters
 He was appointed an assistant secretary of the bank in 1950, assistant vice president in 1953 and vice president in 1957. Promoted to senior vice president in 1964, he was put in charge of Chemical's 145 branches in the metropolitan area at the time.
He was named executive vice president in 1967, with responsibility for the international division. Mr. Platten turned it into a $3 billion unit before he was named first vice president in September 1970, the steppingstone to the chairman's office.
Chemical nearly tripled its total assets and grew as a diversified financial services organization while he was chairman. It assembled the state's second-largest branch network, after Citibank, when it paid $40 million for the Security National Bank on Long Island in 1975. Security had 96 branches and deposits of $1.4 billion.
In 1979, Mr. Platten moved his office -- and Chemical's headquarters -- from lower Manhattan, where the bank had been based for more than 150 years, to 277 Park Avenue.
 
Building Named for Him
 In the aftermath of New York City's fiscal crisis of the 1970's, Mayor Edward I. Koch named Mr. Platten chairman of the New York City Mayor's Management Advisory Committee. That nine-member panel met monthly to review issues of management and operations.
He was a lifetime director of the Collegiate School, which he had attended, and was the first person to have a Collegiate building named for him.
He is survived by his wife, Margaret; a son, Peter W., of Cranbury, N.J.; two daughters, Katherine P. Tyson of Sudbury, Mass., and Alison P. Vanderbilt of Norwalk, Conn.; two brothers, John H., of Princeton and Peter, of Devon, Pa.; seven grandchildren, and a great-grandson.

HEADLINE: A Silent Budget Victim: New York's Dying Trees

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER

 BODY:
There's a pit on 42d Street, right by the north entrance to the New York Public Library, that looks like the giant footprint of a prehistoric animal. In it is the cracked cork-like remains of a tree that once cooled the passers-by and helped purify the air they breathed. Now it looks like a fossil from another time.
Indeed, only one tree still lives on this stretch of sidewalk between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. It's a bedraggled London plane, with a huge scar running up its trunk, the mark of repeated batterings by trucks and cars.
08-27-91 
 Dog feces and Juicy Fruit gum wrappers lie on its tiny square of soil, as compacted as concrete. Not too long from now, this lone tree will go the way of the others that once shaded the street. Now they are just empty pits. Some are discreetly covered over with concrete like unmarked graves.
 
Environmental Threat
 New York City's trees are in trouble.
In many ways as much a part of the city's infrastructure as its bridges, subways and sewers, the city's trees, which cool and purify the air, turning bare, hot streets into neighborly gathering places, are suffering from a lack of maintenance.
"Eight trees are dying or being taken down for every one that's planted," said Nina Bassuk, director of Cornell University's Urban Horticulture Institute.
Scientists say that trees can cut air-conditioning needs by one third, saving cities and businesses millions of dollars. A recent survey by Cornell University's Urban Horticulture Institute showed that a sun-baked section of Columbus Avenue on a hot August day pushed the mercury to 108 degrees. In Central Park at the same time, it was 86 degrees.
 
Pollution Fighter
 Healthy trees can also cut pollutants by about one third, according to the American Forestry Association. And an abundance of trees can also help raise real estate values by adding natural beauty to an otherwise harsh urban landscape.
Yet these natural energy savers and beautifiers are disappearing from the city's streets at an alarming rate. They lack water and pruning care and they suffer the combined abuses of impacted soil, rammings by cars and salt from the streets. It all adds up.
The American Forestry Association found that in 1989, more than a third of the available planting spaces in New York were either empty or had dead or dying trees. The existing trees were, on the whole, small, or less than 12 inches in diameter.
Though the city plants thousands of trees annually, neglect dooms many. It's also important to plant a tree that can take urban abuse. Ginkgo and locust trees, for example, can take a beating. Pin oaks and red maples cannot. And planting too many of one kind -- the London plane, for example -- invites devastation from disease.
Since 1980, the Parks Department has planted more than 87,885 street trees, at an estimated cost of $44 million. Yet an estimated 15,000 are dying every year.
There are 2.7 million trees in the five boroughs -- 700,000 of which grow along the street. But recent budget cuts almost guarantee further neglect.
On July 1, last year's $5.2 million forestry budget was reduced to $660,000. And the chief city forester, William Lough, was laid off -- along with more than 100 climbers and pruners. That leaves 20 trimmers -- for 2.7 million trees.
"We haven't been able to properly maintain our trees since I came here late in 1986," said Mr. Lough. "These trees should be pruned every five to seven years."
That would take about 400 pruners, according to Paul Berizzi, the city's chief of environmental services. "Even before the cuts, we were on a 28-year-cycle."
 
Need for Care
 "The administrators of this parks department don't seem to bear in mind that trees need to be maintained," said Barbara Eber-Schmid, director of the New York City Street Tree Consortium, a 2,100-member volunteer group formed in the late 1970's to care for trees, especially newly planted ones, that were suffering neglect.
"You don't just stick a tree in the ground and figure God will take care of it," she said. "They need to be watered in time of drought, the soil needs to be loosened, they need to be pruned."
Now, said Ms. Eber-Schmid, "It looks like we'll be on a 100-year pruning cycle."
Regular pruning removes dead or diseased limbs and shapes the tree to withstand storm damage. And regular inspections insure that dead trees or hazardous branches are taken down before they fall.
"Obviously, we're not going to be able to care for the trees," said Betsy Gotbaum, the city Parks Commissioner. "It's very foolhardy. If we have a storm or catastrophe -- another Gloria -- we'll be in trouble."
But city officials say that the needs of the trees are competing with more immediate human needs.
"It's a very unpleasant business, but it's a case of weighing trees against infant mortality and vital human services," said the city Budget Director, Philip Michael. "The Mayor has also indicated that public security is his number one priority after fiscal integrity, so trees are going to lose out when measured against a cop."
Experts here and around the country are shaking their heads over the fate of New York's tree program.
 
'Worst Possible Time'
 "This is the worst possible time for the city to do away with forestry," said Wayne Cahilly, manager of arboretum and grounds for the New York Botanical Garden. "A major portion of the tree population was planted in the 30's during the Robert Moses era, and many of these trees, given the stresses of the urban environment, are reaching maturity."
Trees like the overplanted London plane may present real problems.
"They have very degraded roots systems, and a huge amount of biomass leaning over the streets," he said. "All we need is a couple of big blows and those things are going to come down."
Which begs a question: What will they fall down on?
"Trees never fall up, they fall down, and down means falling on something," said Robert Skiera, who just retired after 17 years as forestry director of Milwaukee.
Milwaukee, legendary for its tree care, allots $10 million for its 320,000 street trees and green spaces. Over 80 trimmers keep trees on a five- to six-year pruning cycle. And its street trees live an average of 60 years compared to the national average of seven.
 
A Squeeze on Trees
 But many cities, crushed by the recession, have put the squeeze on trees.
"We've virtually eliminated care to street trees," said Barry Bessler, the assistant director of the Fairmount Park Commission, which manages 250,000 street trees and 8,700 acres of parks in Philadelphia. "No pruning, no spraying. All we do is answer citizen calls. If a tree is dead or hanging at a 45-degree angle over a group of kids, we'll take it down."
Los Angeles lost $6.5 million of a $19.5 million budget for tree care. It lost 66 employees from its forestry program -- but it still has more than 200 to care for a million trees.
"We were trimming our trees every four to five years," said Robert Kennedy, the city's street tree superintendent. "With these cuts and vacancies, it'll go back to a 14- or 15-year cycle."
 
'City Doesn't Seem to Care'
 "A lot of cities have financial problems, but unlike New York, they haven't fired their urban forester," said Donald C. Willeke, chairman of the National Urban Forest Council. "It's one of the shortest-sighted things I've seen since 1970, when I left. I was a lawyer on Wall Street, but I got out. I found life there unpalatable, and one of the reasons was city trees."
Mr. Willeke, who practices law in Minneapolis now, recently toured the country, assessing the state of city trees.
"I don't think any place is in as bad shape as New York," he said. "The city doesn't seem to care about its environment. It can spend all kinds of money on concrete, but it doesn't realize that trees are part of the infrastructure too." Scientists have begun to evaluate trees -- and they do a lot more than act pretty.
"If everybody planted trees on the south and west side of their houses, they'd save 30 percent on their air-conditioning bill," said Arthur Rosenfeld, a physicist and director of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the University of California.
Urban trees suffer enormous stresses. They evolved to live in a forest, with other trees, with plenty of room for their roots. But in the city, they are placed in tiny boxes of soil so compacted that little air or water can permeate. Reflected heat dries them out, trucks bang into them, people pile garbage bags on them, dogs urinate on them. Their roots are sheared off when sidewalks are repaired or streets widened. They are deluged with salt in winter.
Given these constant assaults, it's no wonder they only live an average of seven years. If nothing gives, that elephant-like footprint on 42d Street may be one of those telling artifacts archeologists come upon: dusty proof of a city that once loved trees.

GRAPHIC: Photos: New York City has 2.7 million trees, but loses 15,000 of them annually, many due to lack of care. On 42d Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, the stump of what used to be a tree, left, sits decaying outside the north entrance to the Public Library, while a London plane tree, at right, the sole tree standing on the block, gets hit by cars and trucks and is often littered with dog feces and gum wrappers. (Photographs by William E. Sauro/The New York Times) (pg. B5)
 
Photos/Drawings: Elm -- The American elm has been devastated by Dutch Elm disease. It taught urban foresters a lesson: planting a mix of trees, rather than blocks of one kind, guards against disease and insect infestations.
 
Ginkgo -- The ginkgo is an excellent urban tree, because it can tolerate high heat, drought and alkaline soils, and is relatively disease-free.
 
Locust -- The locust tree is another hardy city dweller. It can withstand smog, dust and pollution, heat and drought and alkaline soils.
 
Pin Oak -- The pin oak loves rich, moist acid soil. It languishes under alkaline conditions, caused by limestone in concrete, so it is not a good survivor on the street.
 
Red Maple -- The red maple, which thrives in moist, rich soil, has weak wood and is easily damaged by ice. It's not a good candidate for the city. (pg. B4)

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
Debate in Parliament: Gorbachev Takes 'an Enormous Share' of the Blame; Legislators Speak Out: 'We Have the Spirit of Reaction in this Assembly'

 BODY:
Following are key sections of the session of the Supreme Soviet yesterday, including a speech by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and speeches by other Supreme Soviet members. The speech by Nursultan A. Nazarbayev was transcribed and translated by The New York Times and the BBC monitoring service; all others were translated by CNN and transcribed by Reuters.
 
GORBACHEV'S SPEECH
 Distinguished members of the Supreme Soviet: first of all, I would like to support the decision adopted by the Supreme Soviet to convene an emergency session of the Congress of People's Deputies, because the problem itself and everything we have gone through over the last days and the decisions that are necessary are all the prerogatives of the Congress. And this is the first thing I wanted to say. 
 And then I would like to suggest the following thing: that is to invite members of the Russian Parliament and members of other parliaments to attend the session of the Congress.
In the period remaining, I would request that the people's deputies working in commissions and committees in different chambers and groups of deputies to discuss and analyze everything that has happened and the reason for that and to draw appropriate conclusions. What is needed is not just philosophizing but specific and concrete decisions and actions, which must be based on accurate and uncompromising analysis of everything we have gone through.
Naturally enough, in the buildup to the Congress, we will not remain idle. In fact, we have begun our work and we have raised the matter of nonconfidence in respect of the Cabinet of Ministers. The Cabinet of Ministers did not live up to the challenge and actually participated in the coup. The decree on the departicization of troops and the K.G.B. has been adopted.
People have been removed from the key positions in the army -- I mean those who sided with the plotters. New people have been put in key positions. The office of the Procurator General of the U.S.S.R. and the Russian Federation is currently conducting a criminal investigation into the coup.
You are familiar with the declaration I made earlier. I resigned from the post of the General Secretary of the Communist Party and I suggested that the Central Committee of the Communist Party should disband itself. Similar measures and these specific measures are necessary to defuse tensions in the country and we will unswervingly pursue this policy in the future.
 
Signs of Impending Coup
 In this statement that I am making -- this is not a report, this is just a statement because a report would need much more preparation and we need to consult with each other before I make a report. But for the time being, I would like to dwell on the most important issues.
Distinguished deputies, the coup was not entirely unexpected. It was not a bolt from the blue. It was prepared by the provocative statements of certain generals and people in key positions and certain statements made in the Supreme Soviet, and there were attempts to undermine the decisions. And the coup was impending and appropriate steps were necessary to protect the constitutional order in the country. However, that had not been done, although we did draw appropriate conclusions and we rebuffed those attempts in the Supreme Soviet, in the press and elsewhere.
However, instead of decisive actions, there was lack of determination, and I am also responsible for that lack of determination. But this is one conclusion that must be drawn from that situation. There is another cause for the attempt to push the country toward totalitarianism and that is lack of decision in the implementation of democratic reforms, particularly in those structures that spearheaded the coup. And this is not only my responsibility but the responsibility of the Supreme Soviet, the party and the Government.
Our good intentions and plans were not implemented because the old mechanism and the old structure of power had not been changed. And I mean primarily the state apparatus, which was totally in agreement with the policy of the party and there were people in key positions who remained loyal to the Stalinist doctrine. We vacillated for a long time and even at this moment, we have not embarked on the road of decisive transformation.
This has affected the sociopolitical situation in the country. In fact, the plotters wanted to take advantage of the difficulties in the country and it is true that the people of the country are facing a very difficult situation. There's a slump in living standards. The criminality is on the rise. And the overall situation is deteriorating.
There's another reason for the coup and that is there was lack of coordination between the forces of perestroika, between different groups of democratic forces. We were divided. And both in the session of the Congress and at plenary meetings, I used to say again and again that if we are committed to democracy and democratic movement, it would be a major mistake if we get involved in a political struggle.
However, there was a lack of political vision and a lack of responsibility for our common cause. I mean the democrats first and foremost. Without appropriate constitutional supervision, the army was in a very difficult situation. However, the plotters failed to plunge the army into the struggle against its own people, and those were the major miscalculations on the part of the plotters.
 
Troops Refuse to Attack
 They believed, and I apologize for the languages I'm using, but they believed that they could manipulate the people. However, the country had changed, and that was a major mistake on their part. The country had changed. The people had changed and the army had changed, because the army is a part of the people. And even those forces in the army that had been trained for emergency situations and contingency situations, for anti-terrorist activities, refused to take actions against the people.
Although they were threatened with court-martial, they refused to participate in the coup. Airborne troops refused to participate. And you know the actual capability of airborne troops. Just three planeloads would have been enough to remove the Government from power.
And those people who took the troops into the streets of Moscow refused to participate in the coup, and this is another major cause for the failure of the coup. However, troops were out in large numbers in the streets of Moscow. There were tanks in the streets. And those actions were taken without an appropriate approval on the part of the legislature. That means that the mechanism of power is not functioning properly.
The K.G.B. had not been reorganized. It is true that the K.G.B. protects the interests of the state, using its intelligence agencies, but the K.G.B. remained an instrument of political struggle, despite the changes that have been made.
The Supreme Soviet failed to move and members of the Cabinet of Ministers panicked and failed to take action [change of interpreter] face of the committee. All of this helped. But I, as President, bear an enormous share of the responsibility for this. I say this because during these days, a lot has become clear to me. I have drawn a lot of different conclusions from what has happened to us.
They seem to say that I've come to a different country. I could even add another country in the sense -- the way that I look at various problems, such as human rights, and I look at the future also with other eyes.
In any case, no oscillations and no delays will be accepted in carrying out these reforms as long as I am President. No more compromises with those who -- your applause I accept to mean that you are not willing to accept any compromises. Although my main desire was that everything we do should lead to democracy, and this supported my position -- and this is perhaps what helped me avoid doing anything that would have led our country to a catastrophe.
One other reason that made the process of reform so painful and -- the party bureaucratic structures have -- I recall how in the Central Committee meeting there was some struggle against those who were trying to block the democratic transformations. The old system was already undermined, disorganized, but it continued to hang on and it tried to prevent the transformations from being carried out.
 
Soviet Society's Changes
 Its -- we -- indeed, initially I thought it was possible to separate the millions of party members from the leadership. Indeed, the belief of many members of the party inspired me with hope that we would be able to have a genuine transformation and reorganize the party along contemporary lines. But this coup d'etat made it no longer possible for me to think this way. And I thought it was my duty as Secretary General and urged the Central Committee to dissolve itself for that reason.
Even so, despite all of these reasons that made the plot possible, it was nonetheless condemned from the very beginning to failure. The last six years have shown that we did not live them in vain. We can no longer recognize how the country has changed. New democratic forces have emerged. These coup leaders didn't understand this, and maybe we also don't understand each other all the time, but nonetheless we have become able to deal them a crushing blow.
This conclusion is directly linked to why the plotters hastened so rapidly to carry out their plans. I can state with full conviction that they understood that any delay was fatally dangerous to them because such processes were emerging, such as the nine-plus-one process we're engaged in. And not only in the party Central Committee, but even in the Supreme Soviet, we will understand that -- we have fully understood that process. And these days, we have to say everything sincerely and openly, because we are all here together and the country is behind us.
That's -- in signing the union treaty and undertaking the transition to a market, the meeting of the E.E.C. is going to make it possible to be integrated into the world economy unless this coup failed and it was crushed. I would like once again to express my unlimited gratitude to the hundreds of thousands of Muscovites who came out into the streets, fearlessly confronting machine guns and tanks to defend legality.
An enormous role here was played by Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin and the Russian Parliament, the inhabitants of Leningrad and their leaders, and also the peoples of the other republics.
The country did not accept -- however they tried to package their appeal to the people, the country would not accept what they had to say. And in these very difficult circumstances, people took -- were willing to accept decisive measures but not any kind of measure. At the same time, the very fact that the coup was possible is evidence that we are still only halfway there, and we have to take other urgent measures to create guarantees of constitutional legality.
What shall we do next now? First of all, I feel it very important to immediately renew the process of signing the union treaty. The plotters were able to undermine this process. This was one of the main aims, unfortunately.
 
The Union Treaty
 A number of the decrees of this so-called Emergency Committee included decrees by the President of the Supreme Soviet Lukyanov, as we found out later immediately handed over to the information media, in which he tried to show that the union treaty should not be signed.
The draft treaty is a balance of the interests of all participants. Of course, it could be improved here and there, but the main thing is, and here I agree with those proposals that have been made these recent days and the statement by the leadership of the Russian Federation and certain meetings, certain proposals made in Leningrad and other republics that we have to sign the treaty and not delay its signing any longer.
The fact that it can be improved, this can be done by addenda and by protocols and thereby we will be acting on the basis of the people's will as expressed in a referendum.
In meetings with the leaders of the nine republics on Aug. 23, after my return, I understood that the union treaty has got to be signed as quickly as possible. In the meantime, certain steps have been taken, but we are not talking only about the final step in the transformation of our society but only the first step.
Second point: we have to take the attitude with respect to those republics who don't want to sign the treaty. They have to be given the right to make their own choice. After signing the treaty we have to start business discussions with those who want to leave the union.
The preparatory work can be done here and now. The agreement with them has got to contain all guarantees of the observation of human rights, regardless of their ethnicity. We have to solve the question of compensating those citizens who don't want to remain outside the union but want to join it, the question of the military infrastructure, where it has to be retained for a certain period of time on the territory of those republics which have separated from the union.
At the same time, considering the vital interests of all 15 republics in maintaining economic ties, we have to start to work on concluding economic agreements, and this has to be done here and now, immediately.
In the third place, we have immediately to solve certain questions of how the country is going to be governed until the new constitution is accepted. This has to be done right now. We have to have elections to solve some major questions such as the election of the new U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet, a new vice president. We must consult with each other very assiduously on this.
At the meeting with the leaders of the republics on the 23d of August, a proposal was made to have an authoritative body that can adopt coordinated decisions on all major questions relating to the whole Soviet Union. I'm talking about administration or government now.
 
New Soviet Laws
 It was proposed that we use the constitutional body known as the Security Council, which doesn't yet exist. And we have to enhance the significance of this body in its makeup and its competence. This can be done if the leaders of the republics enter it, those republics that have decided to sign the union treaty -- Comrades Bakatin, Primakov, Popov, Revenko, [GRIGORY I., a member of the presidential council] and others.
We have to form on the basis of agreement with the other republics a cabinet of minsters of the U.S.S.R., although a decision has already been taken to form such a group with Comrade Silayev.
In the fourth place, the plotters would not have been able to carry out their plans if on their path there had been a firm Supreme Soviet with its president. Therefore, we have to convoke the Supreme Soviet immediately. This was done immediately in Russia. This played an enormous role in blocking the coup d'etat. But at this moment the republics in the Supreme Soviet were not able to carry out their rights and responsibilities.
Now why this did not happen, why they did not come to the capital immediately, this is something we have to think about. We can draw all sorts of lessons from this, not only moral and political ones but we have got to be able to insure that this will not occur again.
What kind of formulation do we need in the Constitution or in the law? We'll have to think this one over also. I propose that those delegates here give some thought -- who is going to be the president of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.
I'm ready for consultations on this, am always, but in particular today. None of us should leave anything unresolved. We've got to act together and with the leaders of the republics so that there'll be total confidence and total understanding and total awareness that the job will be done as it must be done. In the fifth place, necessary to evaluate the situation and establish social control over the activity of the armed forces.
Here major transformations are necessary. First of all, we have to do everything to make sure that today, during the work on the constitution there'll be military reform as well. And then this will become a major part of the new law on military reform.
We've got to increase the professional makeup of the army. We have to reorganize the Committee of State Security. My decree of naming Comrade Bakatin as president of the committee has a second paragraph urging him to reorganize the whole system of state security.
We have to erect a barrier against any possibility of abuse of the security organs against the constitution.
I will sign a decree on the troops out of the Ministry of Defense. It's also necessary to suspend the activity of the law on the K.G.B., to work out a new conception of state security, and reform it accordingly. And [inaudible] economic measures. In view of the cardinal changes in the country, we have to revise existing laws. At the forthcoming session of the Supreme Soviet, let us discuss this and work out measures on our future economic policy, considering everything that we -- considering the fact that we are now in new circumstances after these events.
 
Economics and Republics
 We have to do everything possible, and on my part, I will -- we should not be too hasty, but we have to proceed deliberately. At the same time I take on myself the responsibility of saying something about this. First of all, measures must include elimination of all blocks created by the old structures and the old people on the path to a market economy. We have to eliminate all obstacles to this. And we have to accelerate the creation of the necessary market institutions.
We have to move the center of gravity of the economic decisions to the republican level, maintaining the, on the union government insuring a unified economic area. [Inaudible] cardinal change in our financial and creditary policy is necessary. Measures have to be taken to combat the budgetary deficit and to assure the money supply. All obstacles have got to be eliminated that prevent land from being granted to those who want to cultivate it.
We have plenty of land. We have several million such farmers, but that is not the end of it. We have to insure that there be a genuine land reform, so that this land reform shall get the necessary oxygen, and for this it needs our support.
Of course we have to collect the harvest, but there's -- there will be plenty to think about afterward, in the autumn. We have to organize a whole foreign trade, our trade with hard-currency countries. We're going to need to increase the economic assistance we get from Western countries. I've had negotiations with the main Western countries, and they have confirmed that due to the fact that the last events of recent days have convinced them that the Soviet Union has now set about reforms which are irreversible, and they understand the necessity of cooperating, and increasing this cooperation.
Social policy should go, be conducted with less demagogy in carrying out our program. We've got to get away from economic fatalism. We've got to concentrate attention on the major questions of social defense of the workers, supporting their living standard, and in particular of the, those who are less well-provided for. And an acute issue, in particular, is the food and fuel question.
Proposals to remedy this have been prepared in the republics, and we have to think about that, too. We cannot permit a breakdown in the supply of food and fuel to the population.
Even from this rostrum, I want to take this opportunity to appeal to our peasants and to all inhabitants of our countryside, all of our miners, all of those working in the power industry, to stick to their jobs until we have succeeded in solving all of these main issues.
The Committee on the Economy has been set up by me, and it has to concentrate its efforts primarily on these problems, because all these problems are interlinked.
In the seventh place, after signing the union treaty we have to start an electoral campaign for elections to the Supreme Soviet, including the President. These are measures that in my view we have -- this is what we have learned from the events of the last days, and this campaign has to be worked up very closely. Committees of the Supreme Soviet have to deal with this in a business-like way and furthermore, they have to give thought to control mechanisms to insure that the election is carried out legally, and they have got to have all of our support.
This is all I felt it necessary to tell you in this statement of mine, which I have prepared in the wake of these recent events.
Everybody is expecting decisions and business from us, and I think that the Supreme Soviet, and all of us have to do everything possible to insure that legality and order should continue. That means that all of those who are participating in -- participated in the coup d'etat have got to be dealt with as the law provides. But on the other hand, at this moment, we and the democratic forces of the country, and the whole people are opposed to any arbitrary actions that would simply compromise and endanger everything we are doing now.
 
LEVON TER-PETROSYAN
Armenian President
 Distinguished deputies, dear guests, I came up to this rostrum to make a short statement. It seems to me that I regret that we are being led away from the most crucial problem of this moment. And the most crucial problem of the current moment is not the assessment of what has happened and not the consequences, but the most crucial problem at the moment is what will happen to the center, what will happen to the union parties in power.
It seems to me that the central authorities after this coup have been outdated. The center is dead. The center has committed suicide. And to reanimate this cadaver now would mean to get back to the danger of the catastrophe that we had.
As I have been listening to the debate at the Supreme Soviet, it seems to me that the Supreme Soviet is not yet ready to seriously discuss this problem. That is why I think it's too early for me to speak. I'll speak before you at the Congress. . . .
 
YURI N. SHCHERBAK
Ukrainian Journalist
 Dear Comrades: please, I'd like to draw your attention to the draft resolution. We don't have the editorial group yet, but we'll elect it. There are several questions here and we put those in the work now.
Five years after the atomic catastrophe, we have to live through a political Chernobyl. The resolutions and decrees of the Emergency Committee smelled of threats. And these decrees showed like an X-ray machine who is who, and we now know what could have happened if the plotters could have gotten access to the nuclear trigger.
So in the Chernobyl catastrophe it was Block No. 4 that fell down, was ruined, and in 1991, it was not Chernobyl, but the Stalinist empire that collapsed. . . .
The Ukrainian Parliament has ruled that the Ukraine will be an independent because on Aug. 19, 1991, it was threatened by the state coup of losing its independence. As the state now has the right to self-determination and this has been written down in U.N. and other international documents.
So the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet or Parliament has declared the emergence of an independent state, the Ukraine. The Ukraine will have only its own laws and its own constitution and on December the 1st there will be a general referendum in the Ukraine, and we'll see what the people will decide.
I'd like to tell you that 15 deputies, a group from the Ukrainian Parliament, and I hope that others will join in, as the citizens of the Ukraine have spoken in favor of an independent Ukraine. Then we are planning to set up our own National Guard and we envisage some other measures for political and economic sovereignty.
We have been assessing the coup and the consequences it may have for Russia and the Ukraine. The people's deputies from the Ukraine have stated that the events of Aug. 19-21 have shown that the central Government is inconsistent, and Gorbachev included, and the present government bodies have no power to protect the security of peoples, and there are such uncontrollable structures as the C.P.S.U., the Communist Party, and the Ukrainian branch.
By the way today they told me that in one of the headquarters of the Ukrainian head party they had found a note, an official document in favor, in support of this coup. I'm talking about the Ministry of Defense. . . . And there were a number of Soviet officials who backed the coup. For example, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union heard more than one threat to carry out a coup.
In May 1991, I wrote an article, a requiem for the Parliament, and I said that Gorbachev and Lukyanov are like Mozart and Salieri. But today I would compare them to Christ and Judas. . . . And I think we should remember that there were deputies here threatening the President all the time and let's get back to the protocols and read them. . . . Remember, Colonel [inaudible], Petroshenka and many others. . . .
And now it is becoming clear that we should take another stand in respect to the union treaty. There can be three kinds of ties between the sovereign republics. First, they can be bound in one state. Second, the sovereign republics sign a union treaty with the state. And third, they just sign economic, military, ecological and other agreements between each other, being sovereign.
From this point of view there can be no one state but the point is now to avoid bloodshed and to avoid the changing of borders and take into consideration the [unintelligible] and his experience instead of using the centrist structures here. I think that we should create a Eurasian community or something like the NATO and so on. Only these kinds of unions will give us peace, stability and security [unintelligible] the world. Thank you.
 
KONSTANTIN M. OBOROK
Moldavia Council Chairman
 People have been arguing that the tricolor of Russia should be retained as the national flag of the country. We have a particular problem in that we are committing an immoral act. The K.G.B. was instrumental in implementing the coup. However, I'm not going to speak about Lukyanov, but I called one of the deputies on Monday and I asked what was going on, and I was told that everything was under control, that the constitutional bodies were in place, everything was quiet. . . .
In conclusion, let me say that we have the spirit of reaction in this assembly, and many members of this Parliament are reluctant to implement the reforms.
I would like to say a prayer for Boris Yeltsin and Russian Parliament.
 
VLADIMIR P. SHCHERBAKOV
Chairman, Moscow Trade Union Council
 We indulged in wishful thinking when we thought that our Constitution could protect the constitutional order and democracy. The Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. is called on to give answers to the following questions.
What were the deep-rooted causes of the coup and what needs to be done now?
One of the causes was the political, social, and economic crisis.
Our people are suffering, there's a lack of power at every level, both executive, legislative, and judicial.
Mikhail Sergeyevich, let me tell you that the replacement of Ryzhkov, and your special powers, did not help to change the situation in the country.
Another root cause of the crisis is lack of democracy and lack of political culture in the country. As a result of that, a small group of apparatchiks believed that they could stage a coup, they thought that they were saving this country. This is easy to condemn, the plotters, and say to the people that the old system would be dismantled.
On the 23d of August, the presidium analyzed the situation and therefore, today, we speak from the position formulated by the presidium.
First of all, it is necessary to deal with the question of power in this country. This session should deal with the following issues: The formation of a new union government that would take this country through the period of transition. We believe Boris Yeltsin has suggested a very good idea of setting out a government of national reconciliation.
Next, it is necessary to identify the deadlines for the election of the parliament and the president of the country. . . .
In order to defend our democracy and to hold a genuinely democratic general election, we need to set up a united democratic front.
As a first step, we need to organize a round table, and the Supreme Soviet must initiate the formation of such a round-table discussion.
Mikhail Gorbachev promised to discuss the urgent measures such as food, energy, et cetera, and this is our top priority.
People have got to know how he's going to be fed and how he's going to be heated.
Finally, during the last three days there has been a greater change in people's consciousness than over the previous six years. The people have changed. We should not -- should we not make a use of this change in order to implement our economic reforms? The new consciousness needs a new economy. The people should become the bosses of their own factories and of their own country.
Thank you.
 
ANATOLY A. SOBCHAK
Mayor of Leningrad
 Dear colleagues, I would like when I ask for the floor to speak from this rostrum about all the mistakes that we made and the reasons that with our connivance led to a coup d'etat, but today I have decided to talk about something else.
I want to tell our distinguished colleague that all of the discussion here today leaves a very burdensome impression on me. We're talking about who is trying to distort his real position and make himself look better than he was. But let me talk about something else.
Today we have before us perhaps the most favorable situation, the most favorable conditions for rapidly progressing forward in our political and economic reforms.
For six years we have, our whole reform has been hindered by the Communist structures. For six years, every attempt that we had to move away from that center was blocked by the fact that the whole system of the Communist Party of the U.S.S.R. as a part of the state structure delayed and put the brakes on any reforms we tried to attempt.
Today finally we have an opportunity to remove those shackles and we have the opportunity now to move forward, and what do we hear? I'm most concerned, more than anything else, at the tendency I hear to try to deprive the country of its governing bodies. People are saying we don't need any kind of unified all-union authority. We're hearing that everything has to be liquidated, that all independents exist at the republican level, et cetera, et cetera.
There are two sources of danger here. First of all, Nursultan Nazarbayev, a man whom I greatly love and respect, a man who I worked with in Tbilisi in the old days -- and even then I had great respect for him and for his position of principle and honor -- but today when I heard his statement I thought that somehow it had been dictated by some kind of emotional factors connected with a lot of other equally emotional statements by some Russian deputies and some members of the Russian leadership.
Now, I'm not talking about Yeltsin. But there were some statements to the effect that we have to convey all union functions to the Russian Parliament or the Russian leadership, all union prerogatives to the President of Russia. I understand that this evokes a kind of a negative reaction. I understand it perfectly well. But I cannot understand something else.
Today there's a serious danger, a much greater danger they will take hasty decisions. Today we are deciding the future of the country and to some degree the future of humanity. Therefore it's very important that we not do things hastily, superficially, carried along by this wave of emotion in talking about national independence and the rest.
Let me just give you one example. I was very concerned by the fact that the statements of the representatives of our republics, who talked about the necessity of full state independence, never said a word about how they were liquidating the Communist structures and what they're going to do with the party property. There's a very severe danger. All this talk of independence is designed to cover the desire to retain these party structures but in a new form, retain these party bureaucrats but simply call them national bureaucrats or national leaders.
Until we have liberated our country from all the remnants of the Communist structures, we have to be quite straightforward to everybody. First of all, let us liquidate those elements or that system that has been suffocating us all these years.
Let us first of all create the necessary legal basis, and then everybody has the right or every people, every state formation has the right to independence, to solving its own national problems. But in the beginning, it is necessary to guarantee the rights of every citizen so that we not condemn our citizens in various of these republics to a new totalitarian existence. And I think this is one of the most important problems before us.
 
Mistake: Party Reforms
 Furthermore, I would like us to take a look at our ability to criticize ourselves. I think that the statement of our President was the most self-critical, although it could have even been more self-critical. We're talking about the mistakes of the union leadership and personally about Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev.
His main mistake was that all the economic and political changes in the country were presented as the desire to reform a Communist society. So all reforms were acceptable or not acceptable to the degree they were acceptable to the Communist Party.
And so these six years of attempts to reform the unreformable was our main mistake, and this is something we should have recognized a long time ago. We should have recognized that this system could not be reformed, was not capable of being reformed, and it should have been dissolved from the beginning. This is something we just waited to do today. It took a coup d'etat to do it. And let us look at ourselves critically, more critically than we have done in the past and all of this.
Let us recall how we sat by and witnessed the continuing manipulations in this very hall, in particular, the last six months, when we agreed that we wouldn't come, didn't have to come here every single day. I was never here one time to deal with an item on the agenda decided upon ahead of time, that that particular item was in fact examined on that day.
Every day Anatoly Lukyanov, was manipulating the agenda, manipulating the apparat, manipulating our votes in order to get the decisions he wanted. We should ask ourselves why we went along with this. Why did we deputies and members of the Supreme Soviet responsible for the work of this body, did we accept the dicta of this one individual who always got what he wanted?
When he saw that the hall was against him, he postponed the decision and two or three days later, when there was a different atmosphere in the hall, when some of the deputies were not here, then he submitted an item for a vote. That is something which we should take note of.
O.K., the judiciary will deal with Lukyanov and we'll find out what he really did and what role he played in this plot. But let us take a look at the position of our own legislative bodies. It's said that Lukyanov did not [unintelligible], but how about the committees, how about the factions? We have dozens of groups of deputies. Why did not one of those factions convoke on Aug. 19 and announce its own attitude? You are people's deputies after all. The decisions depend on you. This is called the Supreme Soviet. Nobody is higher than us.
Why did not one single committee come and save the honor of the Supreme Soviet and condemn the activities of the emergency committee? Why did we permit ourselves to be led by the nose and did not speak with our own voice? We showed the decisions of the President to the generals. Where were our committees, where was our committee on security, which today, on the 24th, is publishing its conclusions? Where were the other committees?
 
Return of Conspiracy
 Any committee could have met. How many people there were here, and could have taken its own decisions. Why did not any of them do this? Everyone of us here should look at his own conscience and ask why this was not done -- but they didn't do it. So let us think of the kind of system we want to have in the future so that this does not happen again.
I am very concerned that today's discussions will be a very favorable soil for conspirators to come back in the future. Imagine if we had spoken this way on the eve of the coup. Think what kind of encouragement this would have given to the emergency committee. This is something, comrades, that you have all got without trying to conceal or gloss over your own role -- have got to take into consideration.
But we cannot dissolve any governing bodies -- this is something we absolutely cannot do. We cannot remove the President, we cannot dissolve the Supreme Soviet. Who is going to run the country if we do that?
We do not have a government. Therefore we need right now to insure that there is some authority, there is somebody to hand the authority over to. This session has got to solve a number of major issues.
And on the last day of our previous session, when we decide some issues, I think that is the time to talk about dissolving ourselves in order to make way for a new election. We can have different types of elections. It will be a function of the new union of sovereign republics.
But what shall we do today or tomorrow? We have time. This is in our control. We've got to abolish our own law giving the President supplementary laws, this very emergency rule of which was at the basis for many of the decrees of the emergency committee, but which the President did not use.
What is the danger of such legislation, that if one person does not make use of this sort of law, then somebody else will? In this case Gorbachev never used any of those supplementary powers that were given to him, but the conspirators did make use of them in order to carry out a coup d'etat.
Therefore I hereby propose at this session that that particular law be abolished.
There is appeal from some delegates from the northwest and from the three Baltic republics, and I think it will be given to you -- and here we give our positions on a number of questions, in particular the question of the necessity of abolishing a number of laws relating to decrees of the Supreme Soviet with respect to the information media in particular.
We at the Supreme Soviet have to examine the legality of some other decisions taken, such as the one to close up some of the newspapers and informational media. And bear in mind that we have a law on how these measures can be carried out, and the Supreme Soviet should examine that decree as well so as not to, on a wave of euphoria, make the kind of mistakes that will be a source of shame to us in the future. We've got to manifest self-restraint and create so that in the future we will not say that we missed the opportunity to bring our country out on the path of freedom and democracy.
 
NURSULTAN A. NAZARBAYEV
President of Kazakhstan
 Esteemed peoples' deputies: Last week was not just a period of time. It was an epoch that divided us from all our past. It was a time of victory for the reactionary forces. But the people of Moscow stood face to face with tanks that were trying to restore authoritarianism. . . .
Concern for the future of our country demands that we cope with the problems facing us. As we can see, these problems are far from being resolved.
All of us today have a different awareness, and this obliges us to take a new view of the country's future and of the union treaty.
It is clear to me that a renewed union cannot be a federation. We have spent too long chasing after the past. The Ukraine's declaration of independence, and a similar decision by Byelorussia, witness a new historical reality that we cannot escape or ignore.
The situation has changed radically. You know that I was in favor of signing the union treaty, but recent events have shown how explosive the old plan was. We heard Andrei Sakharov call for the union's transformation into a community, a federation, a commonwealth, but his call fell on deaf ears.
In a future union what we have in mind is more economic relations with the center. . . . Each republic should have its own army. This decision has already been made in many republics. Each republican army will send detachments under orders of the Defense Ministry, and if there is a common threat the Defense Ministry will mobilize all of the forces. . . .
This is true also for inter-republican ties. The problem of disarmament should also be dealt with in a coordinated way. Each republic should set up its own Foreign Ministry for conducting external, economic activities and for concluding treaties with other countries. Each republic should have its own consulates to protect or defend its citizens wherever they may be located in the world.
We are used to the term U.S.S.R. We propose leaving it, and expanding it into the Free Union of Sovereign republics. By this I mean all republics including the autonomous republics that have declared or intend to declare their independence.
 
Human and Language Rights
 We should give representatives of every nationality the right to speak in their own language at republic and union meetings, and each republic should have the right to hear their deputy in their mother tongue. Thus, we are in favor of a confederative treaty, and we are convinced that only in that way will we achieve equal rights among republics. Only in this way will we achieve a genuine federation.
I would also like to mention that the existing union treaty is practically a confederative one. Let us recognize this and dot our 'i's. Only if we conclude an economic agreement also can we have a stable situation in which every republic will have full respect for its rights.
We must grant human rights to every individual regardless of culture, race, religion or background. For this, Kazakhstan is ready to invite an international commission to work and be in a multinational republic. We urge that all violations of human rights cease immediately. We are also ready to invite a commission of experts to inspect hospitals in our republic. We also propose that all we also feel this to be a guarantee of the rule of law in our republic. I urge that all question of granting sovereignty to the Baltics, Georgia, and Moldavia to be given at once.
It's true that this may cost some money but human lives are more valuable.
In the new union there should be no union cabinet of ministers or union parliament, except groups or delegations from different republics.
This is a moment of truth. I cannot see any other basis on which Kazakhstan will be willing to join the union. This is our strategy, and in the near future we have to form not a cabinet of ministers but a transitional goverment in which all of the republics will participate as part of an economic commonwealth. This interim economic council can include all of those including those who have decided to leave the union but are determined to continue their economic cooperation later.
I don't want anybody to have the illusion that Kazakhstan will be anybody's younger brother. We will join a union only with equal rights and opportunities.

Bargains for Business

BYLINE: By L. R. SHANNON

 BODY:
A SMALL business doesn't have to spend a small fortune on software. Here are two helpful programs that cost less than $100, one of them far less.
MyBusinessCheckbook is a versatile expense-tracking, check-writing and printing program aimed at the small business or home office with an MS-DOS system, although anyone who writes a lot of checks can benefit from it. It can handle multiple accounts and businesses and give up to 15 different reports on things like cash flow trends and expenses in various categories. It works from the keyboard or with a mouse and can use Lotus 1-2-3 worksheets. 
 The publisher, MySoftware Company, says the essentials of the program can be learned in less than five minutes. That may be a bit optimistic, but it really is easy to learn, and help is a press of a function key away. In fact, there is no printed manual, just a card telling how to install the program on either a hard or floppy disk and how to get started. You can read the instructions on the screen as you go along or, if you are still wedded to paper, print them out.
Despite its relative ease of use and low price, there are advanced features. You can see the history of a payee while you are working, so you don't pay the same bill twice. As many as eight different invoices can be totaled up and paid on one check. And a simple word processor or calculator can be invoked, so you don't have to leave the program to write a reminder or add up a column of figures.
MyBusinessCheckbook is a product of the MySoftware Company of Menlo Park, Calif. Its suggested list price is $39.95 and it should be available at many software shops. People who pay the bills for giant corporations will, of course, look elsewhere.
In a kind of give-away-the-razors-to-sell-the-blades ploy, MySoftware also markets blank checks for both dot-matrix and laser printers in a variety of styles and related products like personal and signature stamps. Information and an order form are in the package.
 
Updated Calculator
 SolveIt, the financial calculator mentioned here about a year and a half ago, is out in a new version, 4.1. It still does many of the things number-crunchers need to do and a few more besides, and it is still surprisingly fast, but it looks much better.
Unlike some other similar programs, SolveIt does not put the image of a financial calculator on the screen. You fill in the blanks of a form and it does the calculations on the fly. To use one form as an example, the Future Value routine -- what money invested for a certain period of time will have grown to at the end of the period -- asks you to fill in the following blanks: present value; starting date; payment period; deposit amount; total periods; payment method; compounding period, and annual rate. With that information, the program then fills in the following blanks by itself: future value; gain; ending date; total invested; total years, and ending day.
There are 25 routines in the program. To list a few more or less at random: net present value, loan calculator, balloon payment, second mortgage, net worth. An extensive on-screen help system probably makes the manual unnecessary for people who already know about such matters; the rest of us will read the manual to find out what EOQ is and what it can do for us. ("EOQ is Economic Ordering Quantity. If you are a large volume buyer, this routine will calculate the best quantity of an item to buy considering the costs to purchase and the value of money.") The definition is followed by step-by-step instructions for filling in the blanks, and an example of the kind of problem the routine is designed to deal with. ("If you have to buy bolts, and you buy 30,000 a year . . .") So, in a way, SolveIt can be seen as an educational program as well.
Pine Grove Software, the publisher of SolveIt, also markets four other programs that are specialized pieces of the main program. MoneyCalc consists of finance routines; AmortizeIt the loan menu; Budget Plus the budget and net worth menu, and finally, RentIt offers the real estate menu. For corporate buyers, Pine Grove will modify SolveIt to reflect company needs. Contact the company for details.
SolveIt works on computers with 512 kilobytes of internal memory running DOS 2.1 or later. It can be used on a floppies-only machine, but a hard disk is recommended. It is $90, plus $5 shipping and handling and any applicable sales tax from Pine Grove Software, 67-38 108th Street, Suite D-1, Forest Hills, N.Y. 11375; telephone orders can be placed by calling (800) 242-9192 or (718) 575-9192. The smaller, specialized programs are $50 each, plus $5. Specify 5.25-inch or 3.5-inch disks.

HEADLINE: Stocks Decline Slightly in Light Trading

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Stock prices held their own yesterday after the strong rise on Friday, with some indexes inching ahead and others off a bit.
Analysts said investors were beginning to focus on domestic issues, particularly on how swift the economic recovery would be and how quickly interest rates might recede. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average finished the day just shy of Friday's record high, dropping 0.89 point, to 3,039.36. Declining issues slightly outnumbered advancing stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, 809 to 751.
Volume was light, at 130.5 million shares, compared with 189 million on Friday.
"It's clear that the recession has run its course, but the rebound has not been as swift as people would have liked," said Anothony Ludovici, senior investment strategist with Tucker Anthony Inc. "Investors see an economy that is recovering slowly, and there are concerns about interest rates."
Mr. Ludovici said there is "the consensus belief that long-term rates will decline, but in light of what's going on now, the drop in interest rates might be postponed somewhat."
"In short," he continued, "the long rates may not decline as quickly as had been expected." He added that the stock market "simply reflected what the bond market was doing, and the bond market was soft."
 
Other Markets Mixed
 The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.32 point yesterday, to 521.38. The Standard & Poor's 500 closed at 393.85, a drop of 0.32 point. The American Stock Exchange's composite index gained 0.37, closing at 369.72. And the New York Stock Exchange's index dropped 0.14 point, to 215.61.
In the first hour of trading yesterday, the Dow lost 9 points, then rushed ahead 17. But that rally lost steam quickly, and by 11 A.M. the Dow had begun a slide that would last until it recovered a bit in the last hour of trading.
Losers in the Dow average included Sears, which was down 5/8, to 42, and Chevron, off 5/8, to 71 1/4.
The most-active Big Board stock yesterday was the First Union Corporation, a commercial banking concern, which was down 1/8, to 27, with 4.2 million shares changing hands. The company's debt was downgraded by Moody's and Standard & Poor's in recent weeks.
Salomon Brothers, the second-most-active stock, gained 2 1/4, to 26, on volume of 3.3 million shares. The stock has been rebounding since Warren E. Buffett took over as head of the troubled investment banking firm, analysts said. But the stock was also affected by rumors that Laurence A. Tisch, president and chief executive of CBS Inc., had bought a large amount of stock last week.
Another big gainer yesterday was Molecular Biosystems, an organic and biochemical research and development concern, which advanced 2 3/8, to 28 3/4. Analysts said they had no explanation for the move.

I.B.M. Lifts Some Prices

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
I.B.M. announced its annual price increases yesterday, but analysts noted that nearly all of the computer giant's big-selling items were absent from the list -- a sign of its worries about the health of the market.
Earnings at the International Business Machines Corporation, along with those of many competitors, have been ravaged by the recession, a factor that may have limited the price rises, analysts said. 
 "It says that I.B.M. is a little gun-shy," said Robert Djurdjevic, the president of Annex Research.
I.B.M. said it would raise prices 5 percent on many hardware and software products sold in the United States, effective Jan. 1, and would cut its prices by 6 to 37 percent on selected products, effective immediately.
The company excluded its newest mainframes and said the 3090 mainframe, which runs on its older technology, faced an increase. I.B.M. also left out minicomputers, work stations and personal computers.
I.B.M. declined to comment on whether economic conditions had precluded a more comprehensive increase. "Our normal business review shows that these price changes are warranted at this time," a spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Home Resales Fell in July

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes fell a sharp 6.7 percent in July, ending five consecutive months of increases, a real estate trade group said today.
Regionally, the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate declined 14.8 percent, to 1.27 million units, in the South; dropped 3.3 percent, to 890,000 units, in the Midwest, and fell 1.6 percent, to 610,000 units, in the West. But in the Northeast, sales rose for a fourth consecutive month, up 1.8 percent, to a rate of 580,000 units, a 19-month high. 
 Nationally, single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.35 million, down from 3.59 million in June, the National Association of Realtors said. That drop followed rises of 1.4 percent in June and 6.9 percent in May. Nonetheless, the July sales level was nine-tenths of 1 percent higher than a year ago.
Falling mortgage rates this month should help revive sales. Last week, 30-year rates were down to 9.17 percent, a four-year low. Rates on one-year adjustable mortgages were 7.03 percent, the lowest since 1984, when they were first tracked.

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
BUSH HOLDING OFF ON TIES TO BALTICS

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 26

 BODY:
Despite mounting pressure to take the lead in the West's response to the Soviet upheaval, President Bush held to his caution today and said that he was still not ready to grant full recognition to the Baltic republics.
Brushing aside suggestions that he move faster, the President said the United States has "special responsibilities" not to make hasty decisions that could contribute to instability in the Soviet Union, although he acknowledged that it was unlikely that American actions could have that effect.
 
'I've Expressed Myself'
 Mr. Bush was asked at a news conference today if he agreed with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who said Sunday that the United States might be better off with Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian republic's President, in charge of the Soviet Union. He replied: "Well, we'll deal with who's there. I've expressed myself on Boris Yeltsin. I've expressed myself on Gorbachev. It's not a choosing either-or here." [Excerpts, page A11.] 
 Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, who stood at Mr. Bush's side during the news conference, announced that his Government had already begun the process of establishing diplomatic relations with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the three Baltic lands annexed by Stalin.
The President's approach was part of his Administration's apparent determination to try to steady the position of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Mr. Bush and his aides still look to Mr. Gorbachev as the original architect of the reform movement in the Soviet Union, despite their increasingly close ties to Mr. Yeltsin and despite the view of some top officials that Mr. Yeltsin will emerge stronger than Mr. Gorbachev.
The President called the changes in the Soviet Union "exciting." But he said he had "seen nothing to change my mind" about giving more financial aid to Moscow and made it clear that Washington was not prepared, at a meeting of officials of seven industrial democracies this week in London, to agree to more aid.
"We'll stand ready to assist when we can," Mr. Bush continued."But speaking for the United States, there will be nothing out of this sherpa meeting that will commit us to the writing of checks." The term "sherpa" is applied to senior officials who conduct negotiations on behalf of their bosses.
 
A Defiant Quality
 The President seemed almost defiant at times as he defended his decision to proceed with slow, deliberate changes in American policy toward a rapidly changing Soviet Union.
Insisting that caution and prudence were in order, he seemed to be suggesting that while he was optimistic that political and economic reform were truly under way in Moscow, he was not fully convinced.
"I'd just like to see a little bit more, a few more cards on the table before we take another step," he said of his decision not to grant immediate recognition to the Baltic republics, even though an increasing number of countries have done so.
Mr. Mulroney said in his opening statement that he was instructing a Cabinet minister to meet with Baltic officials and begin "the process of establishing full diplomatic relations."
 
U.S. Isn't Canada, Bush Implies
 This prompted a question about the political implications in Canada of such a move at a time when there is strong separatist sentiment in Quebec.
He replied that the "Canadian experience and the Canadian history is the antithesis of the Soviet Union," which he said was born in a "totalitarian and illegal integration of states."
Asked about Canada's actions, Mr. Bush bristled. "I think we have special responsibilities," he said, suggesting that American actions carry more weight than those of other countries.
He expressed annoyance at television experts on Soviet affairs who urge faster action, and at a reporter who asked if he was reassessing his policy of restraint in China relations in light of his decision last week to confront the Kremlin coup masters head on.
In explaining his decisions, Mr. Bush touched on what many of those close to him say is an important factor in his decision-making process -- the fear of doing the wrong thing.
"I don't want to be a part of making a mistake that might contribute to some kind of anarchy inside the Soviet Union," the President said. He added: "I don't -- I'm not -- I don't see that we could do that. But I want to be darn sure we don't. And these developments are happening very, very fast."
On Sunday, Brent Scowcroft, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, said the United States expected the Supreme Soviet, which is meeting this week, to grant the Baltics independence. Officials said that once that happened, Washington would immediately recognize them and establish diplomatic relations. But the Parliament did not take such action today and Mr. Bush made it clear that he would not recognize the Baltics on his own.
 
'Let's Know What We're Doing'
 He said the diplomatic mechanics of independence had yet to be worked out, adding: "You also want to know a little more about controlling one's own territory and what you're recognizing. I mean, there are some difficulties there. Lithuania today, for example, is different than the Lithuania that had its freedom."
Mr. Bush noted that the Ukraine had initially agreed to sign a new treaty that would keep it in the Soviet Union, but has since declared independence.
"But does that mean that they don't want a union treaty at all?" he asked. "I don't know the answer to that. And to have answers to all these complex questions at the end of a week that's moved this fast is expecting too much. And I, for one, am going to say, 'Hey, we've got a few days here. Let's know what we're doing. Let's be sure we understand what's happening.' "
The President used a similar argument in explaining why it was not yet time to move ahead more rapidly with economic aid, arguing that until the relationship between the central Government and the republics is worked out, there are too many uncertainties.
"If they're going to get aid from the West they're going to have to have some agreement, a treaty, some understanding, so people know who they're dealing with," he said.
"One of the things that they need is a deal on energy," the President added. "Canadian interests, United States interests stand ready to help, but you can't have it if you have 25 different guys going off in different directions when it comes to making a contract. There would be a benefit to them to hammer out these details in a treaty, so an entrepreneur from Canada or from the United States could go in and say, 'O.K, now we know who to deal with.' "
 
Loan Guarantees Provided
 Mr. Bush also announced today that he would be releasing early $315 million represents the next installment of a $1.5 billion package of such guarantees that the President announced on June 11, $600 million of which was given to Moscow at the time. An additional $500 million was scheduled for October and the rest for early 1992.
 An Agriculture Department official said that the $315 million was in response to a specific Soviet request.
 Moscow had to pay an unusually high interest rate for a United States Government-guaranteed loan when it went to banks to borrow the money last month, a reflection of the commercial banks' concern about Soviet credit-worthiness. A senior Administration official said today that the Soviets had encountered problems in financing the first installment and that these problems might persist for the remaining installments.

HEADLINE: Long Hot Summer of Political Sleaze Leaves Rhode Islanders Boiling Mad

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., Aug. 21

 BODY:
In the annals of sleaze, this has been a memorable summer for Rhode Island.
In the last few months scandals have been breaking out here with the regularity of bills arriving in the mail. Theyhave ranged from garden-variety corruption, like that involving a mayor who was indicted for extortion, to more far-reaching affairs, like the state's banking crisis. 
 As the summer wears on, it has been difficult for Rhode Islanders to avoid the conclusion that, on a per capita basis, this tiny state has some of the most corrupt politics in the country. By now, residents no longer seem shocked by the scandals. Instead, they simply ask, "What's next?"
"I've never seen people this disgusted," said Steve Kass, a talk show host for radio station WHJJ in Providence. "You wake up and think, 'What's the outrage of the day?' Every time you pick up a rock, it's something else."
 
An Omen on New Year's Day
 Perhaps it should have been clear last New Year's Day that this was not going to be a good year for Rhode Island politicians when, in his first official act as Governor, Bruce G. Sundlun, a Democrat, ordered the immediate closing of all 45 state-chartered banks and credit unions until they had arranged Federal insurance for their deposits.
About 300,000 Rhode Islanders -- nearly one out of every three of the state's citizens -- had money invested with the institutions when they were shut down. Most of the 10 banks and 35 credit unions that were ordered closed have since reopened, and eventually all depositors are expected to get most of their savings back. But several credit unions, with combined deposits of more than $1 billion, still remain closed, their assets frozen and their customers out of luck.
The banking crisis was precipitated by the disappearance of Joseph Mollicone Jr., president of one of the credit unions, the Heritage Loan and Investment Company, who apparently embezzled more than $13 million in deposits before he disappeared. To cover these losses, the institutions' insurance fund used up virtually all of its reserves, and the house of cards that was Rhode Island's banking system collapsed.
In the months since then, no trace of Mr. Mollicone has been found. But investigations have disclosed that his alleged misdeeds were only the latest in a series of transgressions by banking executives and public officials. So far, only Mr. Mollicone has been indicted in the banking scandals.
 
Lawmakers Ignored Warning
 Unlike most banking institutions, which carry Federal insurance, Rhode Island's credit unions were insured by a private company, the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation. A recent report disclosed that lawmakers were warned as early as five years ago that the company was in trouble. But legislation that would have forced the state-chartered banks and credit unions to obtain public insurance died in the General Assembly after lobbying efforts that included dinners sponsored by the indemnity group.
Philip West, executive director of Common Cause of Rhode Island, said many Rhode Islanders believe they have been tricked by a government that was supposed to protect them. "There is a huge sense of betrayal," he said.
Since the collapse of the indemnity group, state legislators have said they had no warning of the impending crisis. But in televised hearings earlier this summer it was disclosed that several public officials had withdrawn their own money from the banks and credit unions just days before they were shut down.
State Senator John Correia, an East Providence Democrat who was a vice president of the East Providence Credit Union, withdrew more than $200,000 from that institution just three days before the bank emergency was declared. At the hearings in July, he insisted that the withdrawal had not been prompted by any inside information. And it was not really a withdrawal at all, he said; it was a "transaction."
"The intention was not to withdraw the money," he said in a recent interview. "All I did was make out a check to another bank."
 
A Soap Opera Atmosphere
 The televised hearings, now in recess, have kept the banking scandal boiling along in soap opera style. And whenever the testimony threatened to grow wearisome, a new scandal emerged to reawaken the public's sense of outrage.
In early July the Mayor of Pawtucket, Brian J. Sarault, was indicted on charges of extorting $3,000 from a city contractor. Later in the month a retired judge, Antonio S. Almeida, was charged with soliciting kickbacks from a lawyer he had appointed to lucrative receiverships.
Finally, four lawyers were suspended on charges of having lent money to a former Family Court judge before whom they had argued cases. The judge, John E. Fuyat, was indicted in June on charges of bank fraud in connection with the loans.
"Every day it's been another fiasco," said Joe Gormley, one of the founders of Operation Clean Sweep, a citizens' group organized this summer on a platform of unseating incumbent politicians.
Unseemly politics is nothing new in Rhode Island, which had its beginning as a refuge for religious dissenters and applied this tradition of tolerance to state and local government. In recent years Mr. Sundlun's predecessor, Edward D. DiPrete, a Republican, was often accused of using his office to help his son's real estate business get a profitable zoning variance. And last year voters here in Providence, the state's capital, returned to office a former Mayor, Vincent A. Cianci Jr., who is a convicted felon.
 
The Importance of Size
 Political analysts contend that some of Rhode Island's problems stem from its small size. In a state whose population barely exceeds one million and where everyone lives within an hour's drive of everyone else, political decisions are easily influenced by friendships and family relations.
"There's an enormous problem with such a small state," said Russ Cheit, a professor of political science at Brown University here. "People just don't scrutinize each other the same way. There's an acceptance that things are done this way that isn't there in other states."
Rhode Island's public officials have tried to put the best face on this summer's disclosures, portraying them as the beginning of a healing process that will result in a stronger state government.
But many of them may not remain in office long enough to lead such a process. Polls show the approval rating for many politicians has reached record lows. And several citizens' groups, like Operation Clean Sweep, have been formed with the aim of defeating incumbents in next year's elections.
Jack Kayrouz, the founder of one of these groups, Citizens for Depositors' Rights, urges that new state elections be held immediately. "What we need is a revolution," he said. "Nobody can salvage our situation unless we throw them all out."

HEADLINE: Youth Indicted in Fatal Stabbing In Crown Heights Racial Rampage

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER

 BODY:
A Brooklyn grand jury yesterday indicted a black youth in the fatal stabbing of a Hasidic Jew in Crown Heights on Aug. 19. At the same time another grand jury wrestled with the explosive issue of whether to charge the Hasidic driver of a car that killed a black boy earlier that night, touching off four nights of racial violence.
At the funeral yesterday morning for the boy, 7-year-old Gavin Cato, demands for the arrest of the Jewish driver, Yosef Lifsh, were a refrain of the crowd. 
 Over and over, among the hundreds of people packed into St. Anthony's Baptist Church, people repeated the words they had been saying for days: that the driver should have been arrested and that if he had been black, he would have been.
"Whose kid? Our kid!" came cries from the crowd as women wept, men muttered angrily and people surged forward to touch the motorcade on its way along Eastern Parkway to Cypress Hills Cemetery. [Page B3.]
From the courthouse where the grand juries were sitting to the church where the funeral was held, the events of the day captured one of the central strains of the Crown Heights crisis: Blacks demanded what they described as equal justice, while Jews expressed outrage that the two deaths -- one a killing motivated by racial hate and the other a traffic accident -- were being equated in any way.
Managing this volatile brew of legal and political issues was the District Attorney of Brooklyn, Charles J. Hynes, who late last week returned from a visit to Israel.
The turmoil in Crown Heights has pitted two communities against each other over issues based on emotional, deeply held perceptions and years of long-festering friction.
To the black community -- a mixture of middle-class people living in well-kept homes sprinkled among the Hasidim and bitter, unemployed young people from nearby housing projects -- the accident touched off resentments that the Hasidim had used political influence to gain special treatment.
To the insular Lubavitcher Hasidic community, where life revolves around the practice of an emotional form of Judaism, the rock-and-bottle-throwing attacks on Jews and their buildings were reminiscent of the anti-Semitic pograms of Eastern Europe and the Nazi Holocaust.
So tense are the feelings that Mr. Hynes took the unusual step of appearing on the popular black radio call-in program "The Breakfast Club" on WLIB for a full hour yesterday morning to respond to what he called the "tremendous amount of misinformation and misperceptions" of the case in the black community.
Answering questions about the handling of the accident, he said on the radio show, "It's significant that within two hours an alcohol test was administered to the driver, and it's finding was zero-zero-zero."
What the grand jury has to examine, he said, is whether other factors -- speed or "a distraction, caused by the driver" -- contributed to criminal negligence.
Asked later whether Jews get preferential treatment in Crown Heights, Mr. Hynes said: "I have more than enough problems on my own trying to bring some sanity out of these two horrible tragedies without figuring out who gets preferential treatment. But you know, ultimately that's going to be something that has to be solved by those two communities."
With calm prevailing in Crown Heights yesterday, the focus largely shifted from the streets to Mr. Hynes's office, which said that the grand jury had reported "affirmative action" against Lemerick Nelson Jr., 16. That meant an indictment had been returned and sent to the State Supreme Court.
Because the indictment is still sealed, the charges were not announced. But the youth had initially been arraigned on an accusation of second-degree murder, and Brooklyn authorities said the indictment would track the initial charges.
The police say Mr. Nelson fatally stabbed Yankel Rosenbaum, a visiting Hasidic scholar from Australia, as groups of black youths went on a rampage after a car in the entourage of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem M. Schneerson, struck two black children, killing one, on Aug. 19.
The District Attorney's spokesman, Patrick Clark, said the grand jury began considering the accident case on Thursday and had further sessions Friday and yesterday.
 
Touchy Political Issues
 The lawyer for the Cato family, Colin Moore, expressed doubts yesterday about the grand jury investigation, saying, "They are setting this up for a non-indictment; the black community is not dumb."
The highly charged political nature of the situation was hardly helped by the fact that several Lubavitcher officials are prominent on a Jewish citizens committee organized by Mr. Hynes to consult with the District Attorney. It is one of nine such ethnic or special-interest advisory councils.
Mr. Hynes has asked two of the Crown Heights Lubavitcher members to step aside temporarily because of a possible conflict of interest. One is Rabbi Joseph Spielman, whose two sons were riding in the car involved in the accident; the other is Edgar Gluck, a board member and spokesman for the private Hasidic ambulance service accused by blacks of not taking care of the injured black children.
Mayor Dinkins, returning wearily to City Hall from the funeral of Gavin Cato, conceded that if the driver was not indicted, "it will certainly not be well received by the African-American community in that neighborhood."
But he quickly added: "Whatever the grievances, the manner in which we redress these grievances is not through violence. This is not the answer."
The lawyer retained by the Hasidic community, Barry Slotnik, meanwhile, said that he had met with United States Attorney Andrew J. Maloney to demand a Federal investigation of what he called civil rights violations against the Jewish community.
"It's time we put a stop to this," Mr. Slotnik said, adding that the unrest was "the invention of some very ugly characters."
Asked whom he was speaking about, Mr. Slotnik replied: "I think its self-evident who the racist hustlers are. Its the same people who raise their head every time there's an incident where they can become provocative."
As the day progressed, there were two incidents that seemed likely to upset the Hasidic community further.
One of the most senior Lubavitcher leaders, Rabbi Shea Hecht, was driving through Bedford-Stuyvesant with several other rabbis when he heard a discussion on Bob Grant's WABC talk show about Crown Heights on his car radio.
He pulled over to call in, but as he and several other rabbis clustered around a pay phone, they were robbed by a half dozen black youths while Rabbi Hecht was on the air.
In the second incident, Brokha Estrin, a Holocaust survivor from Russia in her 60's, jumped to her death from her third-floor apartment at 1650 President Street in the racially troubled area.
Though her son, Alexander, said, "I have no idea why she did this," Lubavitcher leaders immediately said it was a suicide brought on by the violence. They said she feared that blacks were coming to get her.
"It was a direct result of fear placed on her by strangers outside of the community using Nazi tactics," said said Rabbi Shmuel Butman, a Lubavitcher leader.

HEADLINE: Buffett Sets Salomon Rules; Stock Up on Tisch's Buying

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett, the interim chairman of Salomon Brothers, laid out a set of guidelines yesterday for behavior at the troubled firm. His message: Losses will be tolerated; anything that damages the reputation of the firm will not.
At the same time, Salomon's stock rallied more than $2 on reports that Laurence A. Tisch, the chairman of the Loews Corporation and CBS Inc., had bought a big block of the firm's stock last week. Traders involved in the purchase confirmed the reports yesterday. But it could not be determined how many shares Mr. Tisch bought. 
 "If you lose money for the firm by bad decisions, I will be very understanding," Mr. Buffett said at a regular Monday meeting of employees. "If you lose reputation for the firm I will be ruthless."
Mr. Buffett addressed the staff in the 39th-floor auditorium, where eight days before he had announced the firm's acceptance of the resignations of its top officers. The resignations followed Salomon's acknowledgement that employees had violated bidding rules in the Treasury securities markets and that top officals had known of one violation for months before reporting it to the Government.
According to excerpts provided by the investment bank, Mr. Buffett also said: "Everyone must be his own compliance officer. That means everything you do can be put on the front page of the newspaper, and there will be nothing that cannot stand up to scrutiny."
But the firm continued to be troubled by the reaction to its violations, including the loss of important customers, numerous lawsuits and the effects of continuing criminal investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.
Salomon could not put a specific figure yesterday on the total loss of customers. But a spokesman said the firm had lost 5 percent of its public fund business, which is just part of the firm's overall business. The public funds area includes public institutional clients like the World Bank and the California Public Employees Retirement System.
Duff & Phelps, the credit agency, put Salomon's debt on its rating watch with an unfavorable bias, which means the rating could be lowered. Other leading ratings agencies had already taken similar steps.
The chairman of the House Banking Committee, Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, called on the Federal Reserve to suspend Salomon as a primary dealer in the Treasury securities market. But the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which is in the midst of an investigation of Salomon, has already said it would not make a decision on the firm's status until the inquiry was complete.
The rally in Salomon's stock pushed the shares up $2.25 each, to $26, and it was the second-most-active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, with 3.3 million shares traded. Some analysts said the buying by Mr. Tisch might have given other buyers renewed confidence in the outlook for Salomon.
The stock, which fell 38 percent after the initial revelations, has gained 15 percent in two trading days. A Salomon spokesman would not confirm the Tisch buying, but he said: "At the price, it wouldn't surprise me. He is a very savvy investor."
 
Volatility Could Continue
 Guy Moszcowski, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, warned, however, that the stock could continue to be volatile, because Federal investigations have not been completed.
A Salomon spokesman said yesterday that the firm's level of customer business last week -- the first week since the resignations and the installation of new leadership -- was down only a few percent compared with the average for the year in the fixed-income areas. He said that compared with the week a year earlier, customer business in the fixed-income segment was up 10 percent.
One customer the firm has not lost is the City of New York. "We have talked with our money managers, and they have assured us that the city has not suffered any losses because of Salomon Brothers," said Charles Moses, a spokesman for Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman.

HEADLINE: Officials Drop Plan to Cut Medicare by $6.9 Billion

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Federal health officials said today that they would revise a proposed schedule of Medicare fees to restore $6.9 billion that was to have been cut from payments to doctors.
The changes come in response to political pressure from Congress and a torrent of complaints about the cuts from doctors around the country. The cuts were proposed three months ago by the Bush Administration as part the the fee schedule, which represents a major overhaul of Medicare's reimbursement policy. 
 With the latest changes, Medicare would spend $191 billion for doctors' services over the next five years, rather than $184 billion under the original proposal. Medicare finances health care for 34 million elderly and disabled people.
Health-care economists had said elderly people would have had more trouble getting medical care under the original fee proposal because it would have made doctors less willing to take Medicare patients. Doctors had charged that the Administration was breaking faith with the nation's physicians by using the fee schedule to save money for the Government.
 
Intent Was Fairness
 The fee schedule was mandated by Congress, but not with the aim of cutting Medicare spending. Rather, it was intended to spread money more fairly, to reflect the work, time and effort that go into each service provided by doctors. The fee schedule, set to take effect in January 1992, is supposed to increase Medicare payments for family physicians and general practitioners, while reducing payments for some specialists, including surgeons.
The apparent success of the doctors' lobbying effort, led by the American Medical Association, illustrates why it is politically difficult to impose comprehensive controls on health-care costs. "It shows what kind of resistance there is in this country to the Government really controlling costs," said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a consumer organization.
Gail R. Wilensky, head of the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, has described the cuts as an "unintended consequence" of the 1989 law that established the Medicare fee schedule.
A senior official who supervises Medicare, and who refused to be identified, said today, "We found a small bit of flexibility that allows us to get around the problem," by using a new interpretation of the law.
The cuts were disclosed Sunday by The Washington Post.
In a recent letter to Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Senate leaders from both parties said they "clearly anticipated that the fee schedule would neither increase nor decrease Medicare spending for physicians' services."
The medical association and other medical groups reacted warily today, saying they had not analyzed details of the Administration's new proposal.
James H. Stacey, a spokesman for the medical association, said his group was studying a detailed written proposal prepared by the Department of Health and Human Services. "We are not prepared to comment on the details until it is thoroughly reviewed," he said.
Dr. Robert Graham, executive vice president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said, "It is an extremely positive sign that the Government appears to be taking account of our criticism."
 
Assumption of More Services
 The nationwide fee schedule has been described as one of the most sweeping and significant changes in Medicare since the program was created in 1965. Medicare currently pays doctors according to the lowest of their actual or customary charge for a service or the prevailing charge in the area.
Medicare officials said the new fee schedule retained a feature of the original proposal detested by doctors: It assumes that they will increase the volume of their services to recover some of the income they would lose as a result of reductions in fees.
Under the 1989 law, the fee schedule is to be put into effect over five years. In its original proposal, the Administration said the cuts in Medicare payments for "overvalued services" had to be three times as deep as expected because the fee schedule governs only one-third of the physician payments to be made in 1992.
 
Insurers May Follow
 Doctors and members of Congress rejected that interpretation of the law. Administration officials said they had now concluded that the cuts could be spread across a larger number of physician services over a longer period, so it would not be necessary to make such deep cuts next year.
Many private insurers have said they might adopt a version of the Medicare fee schedule to pay doctors. The core of the fee schedule is a computation system under which the Government assigns numerical values to various services performed by doctors. These values, ranging from 1 for a typical office visit to 119 for a liver transplant, take account of the complexity of the work, the amount of time required for the service, malpractice insurance costs and the doctor's office expenses.
To arrive at the price for a given service by a doctor, the Government will multiply its numerical value by a monetary conversion factor. The Administration said in May that the conversion factor would be $26.87. Presumably, that number will be higher under the new proposal, but Administration officials declined to say what it would be.

HEADLINE: Insurers Set Storm's Damage at $780 Million

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BOSTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
The hurricane that struck the East Coast last week caused $780 million in damage to insured property, making it the second-most-expensive hurricane in American history, according to insurance industry figures released today.
An industry official said that even though the storm did not cause widespread destruction of buildings the cost of the damage was high because the hurricane struck a densely populated area and because inflation had raised repair and replacement costs.
The hurricane hit New England last Monday, damaging buildings, boats and farmland, and knocking out electrical power to more than 2 million customers. 
 According to estimates by the American Insurance Services Group, a trade group, the largest loss occurred in Massachusetts, with $525 million in insured damage. That was followed by Rhode Island, with $115 million in damage; New York, $75 million; Connecticut, $40 million; Maine, $21 million, and North Carolina, $4 million.
Massachusetts, Maine and Rhode Island have applied to the Federal Government for disaster relief. Although the hurricane also affected parts of New Hampshire, that state was not included in the total because the damage was not considered catastrophic.

 BODY:

116 Pages of Calvin Klein
In a sign that the recession may be lifting on Seventh Avenue, Calvin Klein has taken 116 pages of advertising space in a single issue of Vanity Fair magazine.
The whopping advertising package, to appear in a separately bound supplement in October, is the largest industry executives could remember. In the 1970's Revlon bought 100 pages of advertising in Harper's Bazaar, to celebrate that magazine's 100th anniversary. 
 "It's certainly a record for me," said Mr. Klein, who was one of the first fashion designers to place multiple-page ads in magazines. "I felt I really had something to say, and the only way I could say it was in book form." Ronald Galotti, the publisher of Vanity Fair, must be on cloud nine.
The Klein supplement will be printed by Conde Nast Magazines, which owns Vanity Fair, using the same cover stock and paper that are used for Vanity Fair. All the ads will be for Calvin Klein Jeans, which in recent years have received far less promotion than Mr. Klein's fragrances.
Nothing much will come between Tina Brown and her Calvins: the advertising package will be poly-bagged -- encased in a plastic wrapper -- along with Vanity Fair. All the photographs were shot by Bruce Weber. The model is Carre Otis.
The cover will say Calvin Klein Jeans. Otherwise, no text accompanies the photographs.
"The photographs say it all," Mr. Klein said. "The theme is a fantasy rock concert, shot in San Francisco, and it revolves around sex, motorcyles and rock 'n' roll. Carre lives on motorcyles and hangs around with bikers. She lives the life style I was trying to portray. It's about the audience, it's about kids screaming for their modern heroes. It's on stage and back stage. It's like a movie."
Mr. Klein would not disclose how much he paid for the 116 pages, but he said he did not receive any substantial discount over Vanity Fair's regular rates. Industry sources have put the cost of the pages at more than $1 million.
"They're very suggestive and provocative," Mr. Klein said. "If I say that, trust me."
 
Hard Sell in Paris
 Defying decades of conventional wisdom, a group of American men's-wear manufacturers will be trying to sell traditional American tailoring in Paris at the world's largest trade show for men's wear.
It is safe to say that while Italian, German and British tailored clothing has flooded this country over the years, American manufacturers have had little success in exporting their products. It's a little like trying to sell oil back to Texans.
Among those who will be attending the Sept. 7-10 show, known as SEHM (for Salon International de l'Habillemente Masculine), will be executives from the Greif Companies, which manufacture the Perry Ellis line; Pincus Brothers-Maxwell, which makes Bill Blass; Botany 500; Racquet Club, and Adolfo. The five manufacturers will share the costs of exhibiting at the show in hopes of cracking the European market.
"We feel that as a group we have lot more strength on the world market," said Nathan Pincus, a vice president of merchandising at Pincus Brothers Maxwell. He added that the group had planned to attend the January show but was prevented from doing so by the Persian Gulf crisis.
"This is the first true test," Mr. Pincus said. "With things tough in the States, we're all looking for new market share. It's the global approach to fashion. The way retail is, we've been banging our heads."
Michael Sandler, the vice president of merchandising for the Greif Companies, said he thought that although Europeans have traditionally looked down upon American-made products, young people overseas were great fans of American style.
"For the first time we're starting to see some interest in tailored clothing with a Made in U.S.A. label," Mr. Sandler said. "It could be the political situation, an outgrowth of our success in the Persian Gulf war. We've been competitive, pricewise, for some time, with the falls in the dollar.
"We have a trend of our own: American traditional clothing, which is becoming part of the European mood. Armani showed a natural shoulder, the slouch suit, a move toward American traditional."
"We're trying to start a new world business," Mr. Sandler continued "We're looking to do what the Italians did to us. In order to grow in business today, you have to look at new markets."
 
Shows at the Macklowe
 For a while, it looked as if the Macklowe, on West 44th Street, just east of Broadway, were turning into the Emperor's New Hotel. Although the Council of Fashion Designers of America had promoted it as a central location for fashion shows and many designers said they found it attractive, no one was committing to it.
But last week, Michael Kors announced that he would show his spring collection in the Macklowe. Mr. Kors, whose showroom ceiling caved in last season, narrowly missing models and splattering several editors, was the logical one to take the plunge first. Expect other designers to follow.

HEADLINE: Un-Soviet Unions?

 BODY:
Americans, devoted to political self-determination, can only cheer the disintegration of the Soviet Union, a whole maintained by force and terror over the parts. Yet they must also feel alarmed by the destructive forces unleashed by disintegration. Disunion: which is it, good or bad?
It's merely an abstract question; there's no point bemoaning a trend that is unstoppable anyway. But disunion need not mean chaos. Once the proud, impatient republics assert themselves, the parts still have compelling reasons for recombining in one or more new wholes. These new, un-Soviet unions could serve the republics' interests rather than that of a totalitarian empire. 
 That's a process the United States and the outside world can promote, by encouraging economic links between the former Soviet republics and discouraging any slide toward Yugoslavia-style fratricide.
Last week's foiled hard-line coup, aimed at blocking a union treaty, ended up accelerating the independence trend. Seven of the fifteen Soviet republics have now declared their independence. The remaining eight favor a new union treaty that even more radically shifts power away from the Kremlin.
The rush toward autonomy is wholly understandable out of reasonable fears; the freer the republics are, the less vulnerable they become to some new hard-line assault.
It is also understandable for historical reasons. The Baltic States are only the most recent "captive nations." Byelorussia and the western Ukraine were initially annexed after the partition of Poland in 1793, partly disgorged after World War I and only absorbed into the Soviet Union after World War II. Central Asia, Moldavia and the Caucasus were first annexed by 19th-century czars.
Different republics have different ideas about what disunion means. The Baltic republics demand full independence. The Muslim republics of Central Asia want autonomy and equality, but within an overall union. Many in the republics of Soviet Europe now yearn to face west instead of east. Yet the Baltic States have established friendly ties with Boris Yeltsin's Russia, and the eastern Ukraine and Byelorussia have strong links to Russia as well.
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia got a foretaste of the hard-liners' methods when Soviet forces attacked civilians in Yerevan, Baku and Tbilisi. Independence pressure has been building since. But none of these republics can relish a future as a Christian or Muslim mini-state in a hostile region.
There are also political and military reasons for continuing association between most of the present republics. These include the difficulty of apportioning union-wide possessions, control of strategic weapons and the future of the country's permanent U.N. Security Council seat. And in all republics uneasy minorities worry about their fate under new, nationalist regimes.
Perhaps the most compelling reason for re-union is economic. No one now knows how taxes and spending will be shared; it will be hard enough to control one currency, let alone 15. At least for an interim period, some confederal or community framework seems the only alternative to economic collapse -- and the most practical vehicle for Western assistance.
Western Europe has a clear interest in the stability and prosperity of the East. Nightmare scenarios include famine, tidal waves of refugees and civil war. The U.S. closely shares Western Europe's interest in a healthy transition.
For Washington, that suggests neither encouraging nor discouraging the present disunion -- but standing ready to contribute to post-Soviet reconstruction and, plausibly, un-Soviet reunion.

HEADLINE: SHOULD WE AID THE SOVIET UNION?;
Yes, It Helps Us, Too

BYLINE: By Robert Eisner; Robert Eisner is professor of economics at Northwestern University.

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill.

 BODY:
Whatever the merits or demerits of "aid" to the Soviet Union or its various splintering republics, the argument that we cannot afford it is nonsense. Can our Iowa farmers not afford to sell grain? Can Detroit not afford to supply trucks to ease transportation bottlenecks? Can the Baby Bells or A.T.& T. not afford to get telecommunications functioning in what was the Soviet empire so that businesses there and here, as well as ordinary citizens, can communicate with one another?
Is our computer industry so overwhelmed with orders at home that it cannot help usher Russia and the other republics into the computer age? Is our pharmaceutical industry so lacking in capacity that it cannot provide vital medicines? Would our food conglomerates or families suffer if some baby foods fill empty shelves in Leningrad, Minsk or Kiev? 
 Will our banks or Federal Reserve crumble if we join an effort to make the ruble convertible so that Russians can buy our goods and Americans can better invest in what is or has been the Soviet Union? Will the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank suffer if the U.S. drops its opposition to full Soviet participation in those important instruments of international economic cooperation?
Too many seem to think of aid to the Soviet Union -- or to other countries -- in terms of cash taken from their own bank accounts, presumably through taxes, and then given away to foreigners and hence forever lost to the American people. It is viewed as an international welfare system that may merely save or inhibit foreigners from working for themselves. A dollar given to foreigners is then a dollar less to meet our needs at home.
This conception betrays as much a failure to understand how our own economy works as a failure to see the portent of the collapsing Soviet economy. We are obviously not in a position to provide for 290 million people in the Soviet republics. Any program even partly aimed at that would run the risk of causing them to provide less for themselves. But that is not the issue. It is rather to jump-start their productive machinery in a developing market without the human disaster that might make it impossible.
There is, of course, the apt analogy to the Marshall Plan after World War II, when we helped put Western Europe on its feet, to its huge benefit and our own. Now we are speaking of a vast international effort, with Germany already making major contributions, the rest of Western Europe ready to move and a Japan that may well join in a common endeavor. The U.S. would hardly be the dominant force and would be picking up only a small portion of what tab there is.
But that "tab" is not what it seems. It is not properly measured in new taxes, which are unnecessary, or a bigger, mismeasured "budget deficit." It is rather to be counted in savings of billions of dollars in our wasteful farm supports and subsidies, in new jobs for American workers, in new investment for American business.
In an economy with 6 percent still unemployed and few forecasts of vigorous growth, a world effort to develop the vast potential Soviet market would move us forward as that market expanded. Instead of worrying about the Japanese selling too much here, we and they could be selling there.
On those occasions when events have demanded it, Americans have learned to realize the full potential of their economy, and not suffered for it. By the end of World War II, we had more than doubled the production with which we had emerged from the Depression. In a supreme irony, we were thus able to devote half our output to fighting a war and still, for the most part, live better than ever before.
Our industry thrives on demand for its products. A well-focused program to get the economies of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe moving again will help us as much as if not more than it helps them. And that is without counting the enormous gains from a truly peaceful new world order.
It would indeed prove as good to give as to receive.

HEADLINE: New York Taxpayers Would Be Crazy to Buy $250 Bonds

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Little Bonds for the Big City" (editorial, Aug. 10) shows the same arrogance and lack of respect New York City administrations show for money collected through taxes. 
 Taxes collected by governing bodies represent no less an investment in the commonweal than money invested for profit. One could argue that taxes are the citizen's investment in city, state and country, and are the "profit" the government reaps for maintaining, creating and protecting the rights and freedoms of a democracy. When governments fail in this responsibility, people and businesses leave, and tax revenues decline.
The leadership has failed. To replace lost revenues, the city wants to sell bonds. To imply that money invested for profit will "create a new cadre of committed New Yorkers" is bogus. Only a fool would buy a city bond and then pay taxes to pay the interest on his own investment.
One would be hard pressed to find any New Yorker who invests less than $250 in taxes to the city. I am a disgruntled taxpayer precisely because the city government does not and has not treated tax revenues as money to invest wisely.
Recent and current city administrations have failed to create and maintain an environment for business and living. They want more money. I want more smarts and leadership. That tax dollars -- which should be keeping parks, libraries, school programs, bridges, the arts, social programs and city services flourishing -- will be siphoned off to pay interest to bond investors, whose only commitment to the city is a tax-free high interest rate, is unconscionable.
A civic, cultural and clean environment for raising a family and earning a living will make "committed New Yorkers." And that takes leadership, integrity and commitment -- qualities scarcer than money in our fair city's government.

HEADLINE: Arts Budget Cuts: Invisibility Isn't Painless

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
Here are some cultural events you're sure to miss:
*"The Black Rider," the Robert Wilson, Tom Waits and William S. Burroughs vaudeville version of Carl Maria von Weber's opera "Der Frei schutz," which was twice scheduled and twice canceled by the Brooklyn Academy of Music this year. 
 *"Secrets, Dialogues, Revelations: The Art of Betye and Alison Saar," a mother-daughter show of multi-media sculpture organized by the Wight Art Gallery at the University of California at Los Angeles, which was to have been exhibited at the Studio Museum in Harlem.
*A show of Spanish colonial art at the Brooklyn Museum timed to coincide with the Columbus quincentenary celebration in the fall of 1992.
*The Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Euripides' "Electra," planned for the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
In addition, the Brooklyn Museum will be closed this week and one week in February, and it will rotate closing each gallery for a few hours. The Bronx Museum of the Arts has been closed since Aug. 4 and will remain shut until Oct. 22, when it will reopen, but for only two hours a day from Monday to Thursday.
These are samples of the effects of New York City's recession-driven $28.7 billion budget, which was adopted in July after months of pulling and tugging by the affected institutions and their supporters. In the spring, Mayor David N. Dinkins proposed cutting the city's Department of Cultural Affairs budget by 47 percent. The final budget approved by the City Council, however, reduced the allocation for the arts by 28 percent, or $24 million, of the department's original $87.1 million, which does not include mandated expenses.
 
The Invisible Consequences
 Apart from canceled events and reduced hours, arts administrators say, many of the cutbacks are invisible to the public. The Brooklyn Academy of Music laid off 22 people from its staff of 120. The City Center Theater lost 11 from a staff of 35. Wave Hill, the 28-acre public estate in Riverdale, the Bronx, lost 20 of 54 staff positions this year and last.
The New York City Ballet has dispensed with educational, marketing and development programs. "That's terribly damaging," said Marie Nugent-Head, the company's development director. "Those are the programs addressed to our future audiences."
Gregory Long, the president of the New York Botanical Garden and chairman of the Cultural Institutions Group, whose members occupy city-owned buildings, said: "We're experiencing a brain drain. Having to lay off 25 or 30 percent of your staff is bad enough, but when you're also forced to furlough people and can't give raises, curators and people in middle management look for jobs in other cities, and then they're gone. I know of four such cases, and we fear many more."
Mr. Long said he planned to lead a delegation to the Mayor this week to seek the restoration of some of the cut money.
While generally bemoaning the cuts, Harvey Lichtenstein, the president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, also expressed a sense of relief about them. "We lost about $650,000," he said, "but at least now we're clear as to how much the cut is. Last spring, when they were talking about a 47 percent cut, we were terrified."
 
Who's Hurting the Most
 Cultural spokesmen differ over whether institutions in the other boroughs are harder hit than those in Manhattan. Robert Buck, the director of the Brooklyn Museum, maintains that organizations like his are more dependent on the city for their income because they have less access to wealth than their counterparts in Manhattan.
But Anthony Micocci, the executive director of the City Center Theater, said that for the last decade Manhattan-based cultural institutions had been "systematically undersupported both because there are so many of them and because it was thought we had greater access to private money."
There is no disagreement, however, among cultural administrators that the major institutions fared better than smaller ones. For example, even though the Metropolitan Museum of Art lost $3.475 million in the city cut, that is only 4.4 percent of its total budget of $79 million. In contrast, the city contribution to many smaller institutions makes up nearly half of the budget.
"A 28 percent cut meant a loss of $200,000 for us," said Kinshasha Holman Conwill, the director of the Studio Museum in Harlem. "We've had to lay off 13 people out of 45, and not replace 5 who retired. We're also raising the price of admission from $2 to $3, and we're increasing fees for special events. It's ironic that we're in a community that's particularly challenged economically by the recession, and yet we're forced to try to charge this community."
In addition to closing for nearly three months, the Bronx Museum of the Arts has announced that all staff members will be furloughed an additional one to six weeks. "All of our satellite galleries in hospitals and nursing homes will be shut down," said Lisa Payne, the public affairs director of the museum.
 
Prices Are Rising
 The New York City Ballet has raised ticket prices for its most popular attractions, said Ms. Nugent-Head. Orchestra and first ring seats for "The Nutcracker" have increased to $58 from $55; orchestra seats for "The Sleeping Beauty" have gone up to $50 from $42, and first ring to $58 from $50. "We hated to do that," Ms. Nugent-Head said, "because that closes a point of entrance to the ballet to many people."
The Brooklyn Children's Museum has cut school services by 40 percent, said Mindy Duitz, the director of the institution. "That means that 10,000 fewer kids will visit the museum this year," she said.
Cuts and layoffs have been common throughout city agencies since the adoption of the new budget, but cultural administrators say that the impact on their institutions has been proportionally greater. "Reducing the city's work force by 7,000 jobs sounds pretty drastic, except when you recall that that work force grew by 50,000 jobs over the past decade," said one. "The staffs of most cultural organizations shrank during that same period, and so further cuts today are especially difficult."
The lost revenue, cultural spokesmen say, is not being replaced by private sources. "It's pretty tough to ask people to become members of your museum when its closed," said Mr. Long of the New York Botanical Garden.
 
One Survivor
 Kate French, the executive director of Wave Hill, said her institution would lose the third installment of a $50,000 grant made two years ago by a private foundation. "It's a three-year grant contingent on the city's maintaining its level of support," she said.
At least one institution has survived with its programs substantially unaffected. The Queens Museum has not closed any exhibition space or reduced the number of hours it is open to the public, although it laid off four staff members in June and is reducing the frequency of its newsletter.
"We foresaw this back in January 1990," said Steven Klindt, the museum's executive director. "We realized that our $13.5 million rebuilding of the museum would temporarily cut our exhibition space in half, and also that the recession would have an impact, so we made some changes back then. Last February, we laid off an assistant director, and the entire staff began to take off one day a month without pay. That has meant that we haven't been as drastically affected as some of our sister museums."
Mr. Lichtenstein said the layoffs had been heartbreaking and left him with a feeling of sadness. "After 25 years of work," he said, "we're back to where we were 10 or 15 years ago. Still, people are pulling together and somehow we'll get through these next few years. We're doing some things we're proud of."

HEADLINE: Verbal Scores Hit New Low In Scholastic Aptitude Tests

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
The verbal scores of 1991 college-bound high school seniors on the Scholastic Aptitude Test declined to an all-time low and mathematics scores fell for the first time since 1980.
The College Board, which released the S.A.T. results today, cited what it called a "disturbing pattern of educational disparity" between top-performing students who were accepted by selective colleges and the general student population.
Some educators said they worried that the decline in the general S.A.T results might indicate that a fall was continuing in the quality of primary and secondary education that first caused alarm more than a decade ago. Although some educators disagreed, the officials said they viewed the scores as a sign that 10 years after warnings were sounded in the benchmark study, "A Nation at Risk," the country's schools are experiencing continued problems resulting from a general decline in academic quality and study habits at the secondary level.
 
Call for 'Drastic Measures'
 "The declines in the averages for all students this year are a further sign that we must take drastic measures if we are to meet the educational goals set by President Bush and the nation's governors," said Donald T. Stewart, president of the College Board.
Even though college attendance is at a high, Mr. Stewart said, the decline in scores for the college-bound, particularly those for the verbal portion of the test, is "disturbing."
Despite the heightened concern expressed by College Board officials about what the decline might mean, some educators said they saw in the decline, of four points in the combined average scores and two points in the score for each component, an indication that the universe of S.A.T. takers had become more democratic, with a wider variety of students taking the test.
"If one year you have the top 10 percent of performers taking the S.A.T. and you have one score, and the next year you have the top 20 percent and the scores fall only a few points, then you're looking at a great victory because you have a whole lot more kids taking the test and hardly a change in score," said Marc Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, a non-profit policy and analysis organization based in Rochester.
Other educators added that the change in this year's scores are not statistically worrisome.
"That two-point drop is not a drop in my eyes," said Marvin Sontag, associate professor of psychology and education at Columbia Teacher's College. "It's such an infinitessimal amount as to not be worth commenting on."
The S.A.T, a two-and-a-half-hour, multiple-choice test, is taken by high school students, most of whom plan to attend college, and measures verbal and mathematical reasoning ability.
The highest possible combined score on the S.A.T.'s verbal and mathematics components is 1,600 and the combined minimum is 400. The national average score this year was 896, compared with 900 in 1990. On average, students scored 422 on the test's verbal section, down two points from 1990, and they scored 474 on the math section, down from 476 last year.
 
Breakdown in Scores
 Average scores among women dropped one point in the verbal portion and two points in the math section. For men, the average verbal score fell three points and the average math score dropped two points.
This year, 100,209 black students took the SAT -- more than ever. The average score for black students in 1991 was 351 on the verbal section and 385 on the mathematics section. Test scores for blacks were in the same neighborhood as last year's.
The performance of ethnic minority students, whose scores have shown substantial gains since they were first reported in 1976, showed mixed results in 1991. Only Puerto Rican and Asian American students' scores showed increases in both verbal and math sections in 1991.
Among the possible explanations offered by some educators for the decline is a change in the demographic makeup of the group taking the test. The group now includes more minorities, women and non-English speakers.
Others point out that in recessions, young people stay in school longer, meaning a larger pool of students are taking the tests, including those who would not ordinarily be attending college.
Still others, including several College Board officials, attributed the decline to less rigorous academic standards, less time spent reading at home and in school, too much television and too many videos.
Mr. Stewart agreed, saying demographic changes alone could not explain the drop in test scores, because there is an effect also of what people are being taught, he said.
Generally, the students competing for the colleges with the toughest entrance standards take the S.A.T. and special subject-specific Achievement Tests, as compared with many students who take only the S.A.T.
 
Specter of a Division
 He noted that students who took the board's subject-specific achievement tests, required by the nation's most selective colleges, scored an average of nearly 100 points higher on each part of the S.A.T. test than did the others taking the same portions. These students, who represent about 20 percent of all those who take the S.A.T. nationally, have average S.A.T. scores of 515 on the verbal portion and 584 on the mathematics portion. This group has continued to score substantially higher, on average, than the national mean since the agency began calculating the mean in 1976.
"If this kind of dichotomy continues, we could evolve into a nation divided between a small class of educational elite and an underclass of students academically ill-prepared for the demands of college or the workplace," said Mr. Stewart.
He noted that among S.A.T takers, 65 percent had four or more years of math, 55 percent had enrolled in a trigonometry course and 44 percent had taken physics -- with lower percentages for nearly all ethnic minority students.
Mr. Tucker conceded that if the best students take the achievement tests, it is not surprising that they also outscore students who only take the S.A.T. Top-scoring students, particularly those who take the subject-specific Achievement Tests, tend to be the most advantaged, he said.
"Disproportionately, they tend to go to the best high schools and the best high schools are disproportionately where the real estate prices are highest," he said. "That essentially means that the people who are able to go to those school districts have the highest incomes."
Instead, the drop may reflect the greater proportion of high school students taking the test, said Mr. Tucker. This year 1,032,685 students took the test, an increase of 7,162 over 1990.
With more students taking the test, he said, the decline "is not necessarily a downward trend."
He also emphasized that the S.A.T. test does not measure intelligence or the ability to learn.
"If the S.A.T. is measuring intelligence, then we should be extremely alarmed by falling scores because that would mean that American kids are being born less intelligent," he said. "The real issue is whether our kids know what they need to know and are they able to do what they need to do to do college level work. The S.A.T. doesn't tell you that."
Ramsey Selden, director of the state education assessment center for the Chief State School Officers, said another problem with extrapolating overall educational trends from the S.A.T. tests was that they do not test representative samples of students.
For example, while Iowa reported the highest average scores, with a verbal score of 515 and a score of 578 in mathematics, only 5 percent of its graduates took the test. South Carolina reported the lowest averages, with verbal scores of 395 and scores of 437 in mathematics, but 58 percent of its high school seniors took the test.

BYLINE: By George Judson

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
Thelma Williams stood at a microphone, staring down homeowners who had come to the Housing Authority to oppose a plan to scatter public housing across New Haven. The agency hopes to do this by buying individual houses and condominiums and renting them.
Mrs. Williams, who lives in the authority's Brookside Avenue apartments, was sure of one thing: "A certain stigma has been laid upon public-housing tenants as a whole." 
 Like Newark, New Haven has torn down a blighted housing project. Now it must replace half of the 366 apartments. Like Yonkers, it plans to put new public housing in areas that don't have a lot. Unlike Yonkers, it decided this without the help of a Federal judge.
That doesn't make the city's homeowners any happier. The areas without a lot of public housing are their neighborhoods.
Public housing here is not pretty. This city pursued urban renewal in the 1950's and social welfare in the 60's as aggressively as any, but now even the cinderblock and concrete look worn. There is vandalism and graffiti and drug dealing. Many apartments are simply boarded up.
So now the Housing Authority wants to buy houses and rent them. The homeowners, who learned the addresses of 10 targeted houses the day before the hearing at which Mrs. Williams faced them, distrust the authority. It can't maintain its own projects, so who will care for these houses? Certainly not the tenants, the homeowners say.
"Renters, regardless of income, view their living quarters as a stopping-off place along the way," two Alderwomen, Elaine Braffman and Elizabeth McCormack, said in a statement.
Some speakers were blunter. "I don't feel these people in the housing projects have proved themselves," said Lisa Lancia, a young homeowner in the Fair Haven section, where many of the purchases are planned.
There is a scent of race to all this, an odor of class, a sharp edge of fear. People who own their own homes in Fair Haven or Edgewood generally don't visit apartments in Brookside or any other project. They don't see inside, where working families make their homes; they see the outside, what those families endure. They don't want that for their families.
What angered Mrs. Williams, who is president of the authority's tenants association and helps screen residents at Brookside, was the assumption that public-housing tenants don't share these concerns. She readily admits to prejudice in choosing her neighbors. "I'm prejudiced against anybody who makes my life living hell," she said.
The authority has voted to buy 28 homes and has selected sites for 28 more, leaving 127 to go. Its executive director, David L. Echols, assured residents that a management company (to be named) would care for the properties and that tenants would be "tightly screened" (in a process to be determined).
The issue of trust, however, is already dead for Jill and Daniel Lenhart.
In 1989 the Lenharts paid $124,000 for a town house in Fair Haven, a few minutes from downtown. They were committed to the city and its social services. He is personnel manager at the Hill Health Center, which serves the poor Hill neighborhood; she works on the children's psychiatric ward at the Hospital of St. Raphael.
By 1990 only two other homes in Chamberlain Court, their 44-unit complex, had been sold. The builder applied to a state affordable-housing program, set up to buy 500 condominiums at bargain prices. The program largely failed; only four deals were completed, only 73 homes bought. But 34 were at Chamberlain Court, sold to a nonprofit housing group for an average price of $91,000.
This summer the builder sold the last seven units to the Housing Authority for its scattered-site program.
The Lenharts understand the need for affordable housing; they chose New Haven, in part, because they qualified for a state-subsidized mortgage here. But they also know their home is now worth far less than that mortgage. They want out, and they don't see why they should have to walk away.
"I understand affordable housing has to go somewhere, but that doesn't mean you have to put me into bankruptcy," Daniel Lenhart said.
The state's affordable-housing plan didn't foresee people like the Lenharts. It counted on creating a mix of incomes by buying small numbers of condominiums in complexes that were largely sold out. But owner associations in healthy complexes blocked the sales, while Chamberlain Court, without an association, unloaded as many units as possible.
When Chamberlain Court forms its association, there will be only five owners: the nonprofit group's co-operative, with 34 votes, the Housing Authority, with seven votes, and the Lenharts and their two neighbors, with one vote each.
"I want people to live here," Jill Lenhart said.
"But we want them to do it the right way," her husband added.

America West Airlines Names Chief Executive

BYLINE: The Associated Press

 BODY:
America West Airlines Inc. said yesterday that Michael J. Conway, the company's president, would replace Edward R. Beauvais as chief executive. Mr. Beauvais, the airline's top executive since it was founded in 1981, will remain chairman of the financially troubled carrier.
Mr. Beauvais said he recommended the change because the airline needed Mr. Conway's financial expertise as it worked its way through a bankruptcy reorganization. 
 America West's move represented the second time in a week that an airline in bankruptcy court promoted a financial expert to the highest levels of management. The head of Continental Airlines stepped down last Thursday to be replaced by the carrier's executive vice president for finance and marketing.
Mr. Conway, who is 46, has been the company's chief operating officer since its inception. He became president in 1984.
Mr. Beauvais, who is 54, said it was appropriate to promote a financial expert now that the company has arranged for $55 million in loans from Northwest Airlines and an aircraft-leasing company. Those loans are subject to the bankruptcy court's approval.
America West, which has its headquarters in Tempe, Ariz., and hubs in Phoenix and Las Vegas, Nev., has implemented a $100 million cost-cutting program that includes trimming its route system, returning some planes to leasing companies and imposing an across-the-board pay cut of 10 percent. The airline has also laid off or placed on unpaid leave hundreds of employees.
America West said the appointment would be effective Sept. 15. Dik Shimizu, a spokesman, said the company's board took the action during an unscheduled meeting over the weekend.
America West filed for protection from its creditors in United States Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix on June 27. The company lost $80.8 million in the first half of 1991.
America West attributes its financial troubles to high fuel prices and lower demand brought on by the Gulf War and the recession.
Efforts will continue to reduce costs, with every aspect of the company under scrutiny, Mr. Conway said in a statement released by the company.

Turning Waste Plastics Into Fuels

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARREN, Mich.

 BODY:
As complex plastics increasingly replace metals in cars and appliances, recycling these products becomes a larger problem. Attention is now turning to a high-temperature process called pyrolysis that breaks down plastics into burnable oil and gas.
Auto makers and plastic suppliers hope to demonstrate within a few years that this technique has great commercial potential. Environmental advocates question whether pyrolysis is truly recycling, but backers of the technique say it is far better than throwing the plastic away. 
Pyrolysis breaks materials down by heating them at high temperatures in the absence of air. Because no oxygen is present, plastics and rubber left over from cars do not burn, as they would in an incinerator. Instead, the heat, about 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit, breaks the complex hydrocarbons down into simpler molecules, producing a liquid resembling heating oil and a combustible gas, along with some ash.
 
Potential for Pollution
 Because nothing except the fuel for the pyrolysis reactor is burned, the technique may cause less air pollution than incinerators. But if the gas produced by pyrolysis is used to heat the reactor once it reaches operating temperature, as most plans envision, pollution will result from plastic and rubber that contain chlorine or sulfur, said Raymond Machacek, of A. D. Little, a consulting firm.
Vinyl plastics contain chlorine, and sulfur is used in the vulcanization of rubber. The chlorine and sulfur atoms tend to form hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, which are toxic pollutants, Mr. Machacek said.
The growing amount of plastic in automobiles causes grumbling among metal recyclers, because it results in more worthless material that must be disposed of in landfills, at additional cost. Unlike plastic soda bottles, which can easily be reprocessed, most of the plastics left after cars are shredded and the metals extracted are composites of materials that have been further contaminated by paint and adhesives.
"Very often you will have incompatible plastics glued together," said Richard L. Klimisch, an environmental specialist at the General Motors Corporation's Technical Center here. In addition, many of the plastics are a type known as thermosets, which cannot be melted down and used again, like the material in soda bottles.
A car on exhibit at the technical center, cut away to display new sound-deadening insulation materials, also inadvertently illustrates how difficult these new materials might be to recycle. Several of the insulating materials are simply labeled, "Complex blend of various stuff."
Researchers at the G.M. Technical Center are running perhaps the largest pyrolysis trials, but an association that includes several major plastic and rubber makers, including Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Dow Chemical, Eagle-Picher, Allied-Signal and Owens-Corning Fiberglas, is also experimenting with the technique.
Industry trends make it clear that metal recyclers are going to have to find ways to cope with more plastic. "Cost is driving the industry to greater use of plastic," said Irvin E. Poston, a plastics specialist at G.M.
He notes that plastic body parts are lighter than steel, requiring less costly tooling to shape and improving fuel economy. The entire outer body of G.M.'s new line of mini-vans, like the Chevrolet Lumina APV, is made of composite plastic. Pyrolysis recovers the energy content of plastic after its useful life is finished, he said.
Plastics suppliers say they may be able to use the ash produced in pyrolysis as well, particularly if the feedstock is uncontaminated scrap from the production process. Since some of the composites used in auto body panels consist of 50 percent inert filler, clean ash might be substituted for the limestone used now. But it is less likely that ash from shredder residue contaminated with other substances could be used.
Industry officials have been quick to label pyrolysis a form of recycling, but some environmentalists say it is similar to incineration, because the material is destroyed and some energy is used. "We do not consider incineration as recycling on this side of the environmental fence, and a lot of people put pyrolysis in the same category," said Lisa Collaton, a solid-waste specialist at the Environmental Action Foundation in Washington.
Added John Ruston of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York, "Pyrolysis is not recycling; it is pyrolysis."
Mr. Poston said G.M. and some plastic suppliers had run pyrolysis tests on shredder residue at two operations for processing old tires. He said that once the material reached operating temperature, it gave off enough gas to be self-sustaining without external fuel. The recovered oil is available for sale.
He said the company and its suppliers planned larger-scale tests to see if the approach was technically and economically feasible in commercial quantities. "We have done 5,000 pounds; now we are going to do a run of 50,000 pounds so we can see the true economics," Mr. Poston said.
 
More Plastic in Cars
 A group of plastic parts suppliers predicts that the amount of thermoset materials going into cars will almost double by 1995, to 423 million pounds, from 242 million pounds in 1990. That is in addition to thermoplastic materials, which can be melted and used again.
Officials involved in recycling say pyrolysis may have a place in materials disposal, after more valuable plastic parts of old cars and appliances have been pulled out for recycling. "Pyrolysis can be part of the waste-management approach, but we should not give up on recovering various plastic streams for re-use," said Michael Fisher, a technical director at the Council for Solid Waste Solutions, a plastics industry group.
Noting that it took metal recyclers several decades to refine techniques for separating different metals and alloys, he said that the plastics industry was just beginning the process. "There are 20 different types of plastic on an automobile," he said. "Some will be recycled, and some will go for pyrolysis."
Herschel Cutler, executive director of the Institute for Scrap Recycling Industries, said the institute was interested in pyrolysis, despite economic, technical and pollution problems with some other experiments. "There have been some plants in the past that were dismal failures," he said.
Nevertheless, he said, with the amount of plastic in cars rising, "we are still looking at it." He added, "We may see a new generation of pyrolytic activity that really can convert materials to oil, gas and carbon black."

 Heating plastic and rubber waste at about 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit in the absence of air, a process known as pyrolysis, breaks down complex hydrocarbons into simpler molecules.
 Pyrolysis produces an oil resembling heating oil; a gas, mostlymethane, used to heat the waste material; exhaust, mostly carbon dioxide and water, and ash.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Why Black Men Have Lost Ground

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IT is no great puzzle why young male workers have had to run so hard over the last 15 years simply to stay in place. They are the first generation to compete with women workers on a nearly equal basis. More important, they are the first postwar generation to enter the labor market when labor productivity was barely growing.
The mystery is why, in spite of the triumphs of the civil rights movement, young black men have lost ground to their white counterparts during the period. 
 Economists like simple explanations -- especially ones that point toward simple policy fixes. But in this case, argue John Bound of the University of Michigan and Richard Freeman of Harvard, simplicity is the enemy of truth.
No single cause stands out in their analysis of stagnating employment opportunities for black men, published last month in a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper. Anything that could go wrong, it seems, has gone wrong, damaging the job prospects of black college graduates as well as high school dropouts.
There is no disputing that the drive for racial equality in the workplace ran out of steam in the mid-1970's. Adjusted for education levels, the gap in weekly earnings for black men and white men with less than 10 years of work experience fell from 35 percent in 1963 to just 11 percent in 1975. But since then, it has crept back up to 18 percent.
Young black men face parallel problems in getting jobs. In 1973 the black-white gap in employment rates was 9 percentage points; by 1989 it had widened to 15.
What happened? Many small things rather than one big thing.
The researchers divided black men by region (Northeast, Midwest, South) and by education (college graduates, high school graduates, dropouts). All of these sub-groups lost ground on wages and (with one modest exception) on employment rates as well. But the differences in the rate of loss are striking.
College graduates did especially badly on wages. The white-black differences for college graduates widened three times faster than the gap for high school graduates and six times faster than the gap for dropouts. Midwestern blacks were also particularly big losers, losing far more ground than their Southern counterparts.
The pattern is somewhat different on rates of employment. Dropouts' prospects deteriorated far more rapidly than the prospects for all young male blacks. And in contrast to Southerners and Midwesterners, young male blacks in the Northeast actually gained a little on whites.
Using statistical regression techniques to dig deeper, the economists found that blacks had the misfortune of being in the wrong places and the wrong occupations at the wrong time. For example, relatively more depend on minimum-wage jobs for a living. The erosion of the minimum wage as a fraction of average wages is all that is needed to explain 17 percent of the ground lost by young male blacks. Similarly, a disproportionate number were union members. Thus as union wages fell relative to wages in general, blacks lost more than whites -- a phenomenon that explains 5 percent of the change in the earnings gap.
Then there are the twin problems of occupation and industry. More blacks wore blue collars and more worked in manufacturing. Both groups suffered heavily in the early 1980's, when foreign competition savaged the Rust Belt. This one-two punch accounts for 29 percent of the relative decline in the wages of young blacks.
Slippage in employment rates is largely a problem at the unskilled end of the job spectrum. And here, Mr. Bound and Mr. Freeman look to crime and punishment for the explanation: Between 1980 and 1989 the proportion of black high school dropouts in jail or on probation has grown by one-fifth. This explains fully 71 percent of the downward trend in black dropouts at work.
These results should depress people who look to government to promote equality of result as well as equality of opportunity. The great forces of history that have exposed the American economy to global competition and have led to a restructuring of industry probably cannot be stopped. Even if they could, few policy makers would be inclined to reverse course solely to keep black workers out of harm's way.
By the same token, Americans already have very good reasons to end the plague of urban street crime. The fact that crime leaves so many young black men effectively unemployable is not, in itself, likely to move public policy.
About the best that can be said here is that the worst is probably over. The regional economic shifts that worked to the disadvantage of blacks have apparently ended. So, too, have the shifts in labor demand that made blue-collar workers such a drug on the market during the 1980's. With a little luck, future trends will prove colorblind -- or even work to the advantage of racial minorities.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Looking at Sears As a Good Buy

BYLINE: By Eben Shapiro

 BODY:
WHEN a new Sears store opened recently in Nashville, Edward A. Brennan, the company's chairman, rolled up his sleeves and sold a refrigerator.
Mr. Brennan's sales efforts have met with success in a larger arena as well. A small but growing group of investors are finally buying Mr. Brennan's claim that he can restore Sears's lumbering $32 billion merchandise group to a respectable degree of profitability. 
 The stock of Sears, Roebuck & Company has nearly doubled from its 52-week low of $22 in October, closing yesterday at $41.625. It was off 37.5 cents for the day on a report that consumer confidence fell in August.
Despite the growing uncertainty over the direction of the economy, retail stocks have done well this year, buoyed by the prospect of a pickup in consumer spending. As of last week, stocks in Standard & Poor's retail group were up 49.6 percent since Jan. 1, compared with a 65.5 percent increase for Sears in the period. The S.& P. 500 was up 19.3 percent since the beginning of the year.
Because of its strength in selling durable goods like washing machines, Sears, which accounts for more than 35 percent of all washers and dryers sold in the country, is expected to benefit strongly from any increase in consumer spending. But if the economy does not rebound, Sears and other retailers will be hurt.
There has been a persistent notion that Sears is worth more in pieces than whole and that that has driven the stock up, but Mr. Brennan rejects that, saying flatly, "We do not intend to break up the company."
Some analysts say the stock has further to rise. "Sears should have a very strong earnings rebound over the next few years," said Daniel Barry of Kidder, Peabody, who has been recommending the stock since the spring. Mr. Barry says he expects Sears stock to hit $58 next year.
No one is prepared to declare that Sears's retailing problems have been fixed. The company is still burdened by high costs and less-than-appealing offerings in important lines like women's apparel. The company continues to face stiff competition in its most important areas from stores that concentrate on one type of product, like The Gap in clothing and Circuit City in electronics and appliances.
But the impact of Sears's cost-cutting program is beginning to show up in the company's financial results. At the end of July, the retail division showed the first inkling of improving profits in several years. Despite a drop in sales during the quarter because of the recession, income increased because of reduced expenses. By laying off tens of thousands of employees, the company expects to eliminate $600 million in expenses this year.
While the improved results were greeted enthusiastically by investors, retailing is chiefly a market-share game; cutting overhead does not build a business. "I would still like to see some sustainable sales growth," said Richard Nelson, an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
To that end, Sears needs to stock the right merchandise and design the type of stores that will attract new customers. "Sears is still trying to find a niche in the marketplace," said Mr. Nelson.
Still, it is not clear whether the women of America will ever be comfortable buying their clothes around the corner from a display of lawn mowers and drill bits.
Mr. Brennan maintains that Sears's merchandise assortment and the look of its stores is improving. In the last few months, Sears, which has 864 full-line department stores, has opened about half a dozen stores around the country with a new clean, crisp design not customarily associated with Sears. Mr. Brennan calls them "the first example of stores that we are happy with."
Wall Street has prodded Sears to spend more on upgrading the look of its stores. Analysts say that Sears plans to spend $450 million on store-related capital expenditures in 1991, compared with $2.4 billion by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and $1.2 billion by the K Mart Corporation.
While Sears has become more focused on retailing in recent years, there are still questions about some of its strategic moves. With the furniture business in the doldrums, Sears is expanding its free-standing furniture stores, called Homelife. An earlier venture into speciality retailing, the McKids children's clothing stores, failed and was discontinued earlier this year.
Mr. Brennan took direct control of the merchandise group last year, an unusual move for the chairman of a $56 billion corporation and one that has raised questions over whether Mr. Brennan's time is best used selling refrigerators.
"They need some more help at the top level," Mr. Barry said. "No one can be stretched that thin and be effective."
Retailing, of course, is only part of Sears's operations. The company has the Allstate Insurance Companies, the Dean Witter Financial Services Group and the Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group.
Mr. Barry argues that if Sears can just stabilize the retail group, its financial-services operations make the company a decent long-term investment. "If they can just stop the hemorrhaging in retailing," he said, "you really have a decent moderate-growth company."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher; Gold Closes Lower in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed mostly higher in foreign exchange trading yesterday in an uneventful session.
Gold prices rose overseas but slipped in domestic trading. At the New York Commodity Exchange, gold closed at $354.40 an ounce, down 80 cents from late Monday. Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $354.35 an ounce, off 90 cents. 
 The dollar opened higher in New York from Monday's close here. But it fell slightly after the Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index declined in August from the month before.
The survey by the business-supported research group showed that consumer expectations for future economic improvement dimmed this month, offsetting a slight rise in optimism about current conditions.
The dollar later recovered, however, and Paul Yarden, a currency trader at Credit Suisse in New York, said there were few other matters to influence trading.
"People are not overly scared with the situation in the Soviet Union," he said. He said the Soviet power shift has already been factored in to exchange rates, barring significant developments.
Trading was light, with many traders apparently taking the week off because of holidays in Britain and Hong Kong on Monday and the Labor Day holiday next Monday in the United States, Mr. Yarden said.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 137.05 Japanese yen from 137.02 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at 137.00 yen, and in New York it closed at 137.00 yen, up from 136.90 yen late Monday.
The British pound rose to $1.6795 in London from $1.6775 late Monday. In New York, one pound cost $1.6800, unchanged.
The dollar closed at 1.7490 German marks in European trading, down from 1.7535 late Monday. In New York, the dollar traded at 1.7505 marks, up from 1.7480 late Monday.
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.5235 Swiss francs, down from 1.5240; 5.9435 French francs, up from 5.9365; 1,306.00 Italian lire, up from 1,304.50; and 1.1415 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1440.

HEADLINE: C.D. Yields Decline Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts were down for the week ended yesterday, but the steepness of the previous week's decline had eased.
According to the Bank Rate Monitor, a North Palm Beach-based interest rate publication, the rapid drop in C.D. yields has just about caught up with the last reduction in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board. 
 Dennis R. Kosovak, a senior vice president at Chemical Bank, said bank rates are now in synch with the market.
"There are signals of an economic pickup, and interest rates have begun to stablize," he said. Some customers are taking short maturities, he said, especially in the 13- and 30-month certificates of deposit.
The yield spread between both products has narrowed considerably in the past few weeks, from 80 basis points three weeks ago to about 25 basis points last week.
At the Treasury Department's weekly bill auction held on Monday, average discount rates, down for four consecutive weeks, rose sharply this week, rebounding from the sharp decline last week when developments in the Soviet Union sent short-term rates to very low levels. The three-month bill rose 23 basis points, to 5.40 percent, while the six-month bill rose 24 basis points, to 5.47 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The largest yield changes in New York area banks this week were at Banco Popular De Puerto Rico, which dropped its money market account 21 basis points, to 5.13 percent, and at Chase Manhattan. At Chase, the yield on a three-month certificate was cut 27 basis points, to 5.34 percent, and the yield on a six-month certificate was lowered 26 basis points, to 5.39 percent.
Among the commercial banks, the only decline was in the average yield on a money market account, which fell 5 basis points, to 4.90 percent. Three-month certificates rose a basis point, to 5.16 percent, and six-month certificates rose 2 basis points, to 5.34 percent.
For depositors at savings institutions, there was no respite as the average yields on a money market account and three-month certificate fell 3 basis points, to 5.43 percent and 5.61 percent, respectively. The six-month certificate fell 4 basis points, to 5.86.
By comparison, 20 large banks around the country that are outside the New York market reduced the average money market yield 2 basis points, to 5.13 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, August 28, 1991. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

Calvin Klein Redefines The Big Buy

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
IF Calvin Klein sets trends in advertising the way he does in fashion, magazine executives said yesterday, the appearance of a 116-page ad supplement for Calvin Klein Jeans with the October issue of Vanity Fair might be a harbinger of better times for their recession-racked field.
The issue of the monthly, which is published by Conde Nast Publications, will be accompanied by what is being called the largest ad supplement for a consumer magazine in the United States. 
 Filled entirely with black-and-white photographs shot by Bruce Weber, it will be wrapped in a plastic bag and delivered with the issue. It is the first time such a supplement -- or, in the industry's colorful terminology, a polybagged outsert -- has accompanied a magazine from Conde Nast, whose other titles include Glamour and Vogue.
Bagged supplements first appeared in the mid 1980's, as marketers sought to stand out amid the clutter of magazine ads. But they have become scarcer since the industry slipped into recession in 1989. One reason is the cost, which can exceed $1 million. Another is that as many advertisers fled magazines, those remaining found they could stand out by buying conventional ad pages.
Yet conventional is not a word used to describe Mr. Klein.
"I've never done it," Mr. Klein said yesterday, referring to the supplement's size. "No one has ever done it."
Mr. Weber, who frequently photographs ads for Mr. Klein, presents young men and women, in various stages of undress, involved in sensual and sensuous activities before, during and after a rock concert.
"This gives me the opportunity to say just what I feel to people," Mr. Klein said. "If I can say it with two pages, I'd be happy to say it with two. Sometimes, I need a lot more."
After deciding on the supplement, which was created in-house, Mr. Klein said he realized: "I could only do it in one place. I wish I could afford to do it in more." He chose Vanity Fair, he added, because it is "where I thought it would work. Vanity Fair is the hot book." In 1987, Mr. Klein and his wife, Kelly, were the subjects of an adulatory cover story in the magazine, but they have also received favorable coverage elsewhere.
Mr. Klein's words were welcome to Ronald Galotti, Vanity Fair's publisher since December.
"At a time when business is soft for most," Mr. Galotti said, "to have something unique like this appear is really exciting."
At Vanity Fair's rate of $29,180 for a black-and-white ad page, the supplement would cost almost $3.4 million, excluding production costs, which were borne by Conde Nast. Mr. Galotti would not disclose what Mr. Klein was charged, but noted that he qualified for several discounts. Industry executives estimate the cost exceeded $1 million.
More important, Mr. Galotti said, is a statement he hopes the supplement makes about Conde Nast. "We're considered a little bit stodgy in our willingness to participate in creative ideas," he said. "That's not the case if they're well thought out and profitable."
But whether such a supplement "is making money is not the object," said a publisher of a rival magazine who asked not to be identified. "Making a splash is. You can rationalize the splash rather than the cash."
Vanity Fair has been faring better than most magazines lately. Through July, its ad pages fell 7 percent, according to the Publishers Information Bureau, compared with an industry decline of 10.4 percent. Mr. Galottiestimates the magazine will finish the year at around 1,425 pages, compared with 1,459 in 1990.
The supplement is the equivalent of 29 ad pages, Mr. Galotti said, because it will accompany the 250,000 or so copies delivered to newsstands and subscribers in California and New York, rather than Vanity Fair's entire circulation of approximately 850,000. Such limited distribution is common with print ad extravaganzas; for instance, special ads created by TBWA Advertising in New York for Carillon Importers' Absolut vodka often appear in selected portions of magazine print runs.
William Tragos, TBWA's chairman, said unusual ads become the usual if a client "wants to be seen" and "wants to break out from the crowd with panache."
Not all executives, though, see the supplement as an indicator of improving business.
"I'm not sure I would translate this into a signal for the marketplace," said William T. Kerr, the president of The New York Times Company Magazine Group, "though I'd like to." He added that while "there are some stirrings, I don't think it's a trend yet."

Japanese Planning U.S. Sake Plant

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: GOLDEN, Colo., aug. 27

 BODY:
The Tatsuuma-Honke Brewing Company of Japan is building a sake plant on land it bought from Adolph Coors Company in 1989. The $7 million plant is scheduled to open in the spring, said Bill Shores, project superintendent for the Ohbayashi America Corporation, a partner in the venture. 
 When it opens, economic development officials say, the plant will be one of five breweries in the United States to produce the alcholic drink that is made from fermented rice and usually warmed before serving. The mostly automated plant will employ about 30 people, officials say, and produce sake under the brand name Hakushika for export mostly to the Far East and Europe.

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
Traces of the Old Guard Linger in a New Latvia

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: RIGA, Latvia, Aug. 27

 BODY:
"We have stopped doing absolutely everything we did before," said Maj. Gen. Janis Trubins, deputy commander of the K.G.B. in this breakaway Soviet republic.
General Trubins, an amiable and voluble man of 46 -- one of the youngest generals in the K.G.B., he noted proudly -- appeared to be resigned to unemployment and expressed no resentment about the turn of events. 
 "I can feel neither joy nor sorrow," he said in an interview in the nearly abandoned K.G.B. building in the center of the Latvian capital, as he considered the events that followed the abortive Soviet coup last week that have brought ruin to Moscow's organs of power here in the Baltic republics.
One of his deputies said: "When Latvia declared its independence, we became part of an organization of another country. What is happening is not much different from what happened in Eastern Europe."
 
First Envoy Presents Credentials
 Today Riga also acquired the first visible token of recognition of its 51 years of striving to regain international standing as the capital of an independent country. Otto Borch presented his credentials as Denmark's Ambassador to President Anatolijs Gorbunovs. Mr. Borch, former Ambassador to the United States, said the Soviet Union had raised no objections.
Mr. Borch is going to Lithuania and Estonia to be accredited there as well.
The streets of this Hanseatic city dominated by many Gothic steeples also showed other, more informal signs of the profound changes, whose pace was so markedly speeded by the failure of the coup.
A five-day festival of Jewish culture in the Baltic countries is under way, and bearded men wearing yarmulkes strolled on the streets for what was perhaps the first time since the invading Germans and Latvian fascists decimated the once-thriving Jewish population in 1941.
A banner stretched across Freedom Avenue, newly renamed after having long been dedicated to Lenin, announced that Hare Krishnas would arrive on Saturday.
At the end of the avenue, a city work crew was removing the remainder of the base of the monument of Lenin. Onlookers applauded every thud of the wrecker's heavy metal ball.
At the edge f Riga, near the fishing port on the Baltic Sea and amidst industrial plants, stands the redoubt of the last holdouts of the old regime. Ringed by mines and barbed wire, guarded by armored personnel carriers whose machine guns are pointed toward the narrow entrance as an evident deterrent, a detachment of "black berets," the feared troops of the Soviet Interior Ministry, stands in readiness.
In an interview, their deputy commander, a major who declined to give his name, said that the orders weren't coming and that he was no longer sure what the detachment's mission is. "You know the situation in the Soviet Union now," he said. "We are waiting."
He refused to say how strong his detachment is. "Enough to control the city," he said. Riga's population is 916,000, and Latvian officials estimated the number of "black berets" at 80 to 100. Their camp bristles with automatic arms, hand grenades and ammunition. "There is more here than what you see," the major said.
The major said his troops would fire on the population only if fired upon. "We never fire first," he said. Throughout the Baltic republics, the "black berets" are viewed with terror because of their roles in the crackdowns here and in Vilnius, Lithuania, last January.
The K.G.B. man, General Trubins, discussed the recent changes as he sat under a portrait of Feliks Dzerzhinsky, the founder of the first Communist secret police, next to eight telephones, including one he said was a direct line to K.G.B. headquarters in Moscow.
Since Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985, he said, his job has been mainly the exercise of police functions -- fighting the drug trade and organized crime, guarding against terrorists and protecting civil and constitutional rights.
General Trubins conceded implicitly, however, that in earlier days the K.G.B. exercised surveillance over all Soviet citizens and persecuted political opponents. Describing work that took place in Yuri V. Andropov's long reign as K.G.B. chief, he said, "That was done when there was not a democratic society."
His deputy, a 37-year-old former history teacher who was more ready to bare his soul than to allow his name to be published, admitted to a less tranquil conscience. He said he was proud of his part in reducing the illegal arms network, which he said moves many military weapons stolen here into southern republics like Georgia. But he conceded he had done things he was not proud of.
When asked to specify, he tapped his fingers rapidly on the desk and said quietly: "I leave this inside myself."
 
Ideas Change, Monuments Fall
 Both men denounced the removal of the statues of Lenin and Dzerzhinsky from public places and offered similar cynical forecasts.
"Ideas change, ideologies even more," the deputy said. "In the 1950's, Latvian monuments were destroyed here. Others will be put up now, and in time, they, too, will be destroyed."
The two secret policemen agreed also on another issue. Although they face unemployment, they said, they would not accept new K.G.B. assignments that would remove them from Latvia. "I'm a Latvian," General Trubins said. "We'll stay here. I'll never again be involved in politics. It's a dirty business."
Asked whether he favored independence for Latvia, the deputy replied: "Of course. Who would not?"

Times Mirror Sets Buyouts

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 27

 BODY:
The Times Mirror Company said today that it planned to offer some employees of its largest newspaper, The Los Angeles Times, early retirement to cut costs.
The Times said the program would be offered to employees 55 years old or older who have at least 10 consecutive years of service. The Times, which has 6,000 full-time employees, said a maximum of 300 people would be allowed to retire under the program. 
 Laura Morgan, a Times spokeswoman, said the number of workers in each department allowed to accept the offer was confidential, but she said every department, including news, was included.
The Times said it had had a virtual hiring freeze all year. The Times's advertising revenue, like that of other newspapers, has fallen during the recession. The newspaper has said volume for the first seven months of the year is down 18.3 percent from last year.
Times Mirror said the retirement program would require the company to take an unspecified charge against earnings later in the year.
Other newspapers, including some in the Times Mirror chain and The New York Times, have offered similar programs to reduce staff and save money.

 BODY:

Gorbachev Battles the Tide
A Threat to Resign: Trying to stave off total disintegration, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was said to have reached agreement with the leaders of three republics -- including Russia and Kazakhstan, the two largest in area -- on retaining some form of union. But Moldavia became the latest republic to announce its independence. Mr. Gorbachev threatened to quit if a new union treaty were not renegotiated. Page A1. 
 Purging Tyranny's Apparatus: President Gorbachev said the governing board of the K.G.B. had been virtually disbanded and its military units reassigned to the army. A Soviet newspaper announced the arrest of the leaders of the K.G.B. unit charged with security for top officials, including the men who confronted Mr. Gorbachev at the coup's outset. Page A1.
Not Without A Fight: Mr. Gorbachev is offering the Soviet Union a desperately needed lesson in resilience. "We should not destroy!" he pleaded in Parliament in one of his best domestic speeches. Page A6.
 
Breaking Away in the Baltics
A Boost from Europe: The European Community recognized Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as independent nations. But community officials said independence declarations by other Soviet republics would be treated differently. Page A1.
Why Others Hesitate: President Bush's caution on recognizing the Baltics stands in sharp contrast to other nations' responses. For the republics' immediate neighbors, the choice has been clearest, driven by their proximity and years of close cooperation. But for Washington and other countries, the equation is considerably more complex. Page A11.
Profound Changes: In Riga, the Latvian capital, a K.G.B. commander says "we have stopped doing absolutely everything we did before," and appears resigned to unemployment. In Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, the Soviet authorities have abandoned airport entry points. Page A7.
Olympic Recognition: The president of the International Olympic Committee said in Tokyo that the three Baltic republics might participate as independent teams in the Barcelona Olympics next summer. Juan Antonio Samaranch, the Olympic Committee's president, added that the organization may grant the three republics provisional membership at a meeting in Berlin next month. He suggested that the world track and field championships in Tokyo this week might be the last time the Soviet Union fields a single team in its current form.
 
 Of Alibis, Conspiracy and Betrayal
Rampant Rumors: One thing that hasn't changed in Moscow is the strong sense of conspiracy, well-founded or not, among its inhabitants. The search for an ultimate culprit in the coup has fanned out to encompass radical democrats, President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian republic and, of course, President Gorbachev himself. Page A10.
The Coup Flu, or Just Following Orders: It turns out now that just about everyone was against the putsch, or sick, or just doing his job. The most ironclad aibi was probably that of two Soviet astronauts who continued circling the earth through all the excitement. Page A10.

HEADLINE: For Chinese Artists, Shattered Dreams Despite Freedom

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
A shocked and solemn crowd consisting mostly of young artists from China had gathered in the narrow, dingy apartment on West 145th Street. Upstairs, in a friend's home, a young woman was weeping inconsolably. Between sobs, Duan Haimeng, the widow of a Chinese artist slain near Times Square, managed to say, "I never dreamed that something like this could happen."
On Aug. 18, Ms. Duan's 34-year-old husband, Lin Lin, was shot dead while drawing a portrait in the wee hours of Sunday morning. The police said a young man provoked an argument with Mr. Lin and then shot him through the chest when the artist answered back. They later arrested James Skinner, 21, of Brooklyn, and charged him with second-degree murder in the killing.
 
Survival or Freedom?
 The incident stunned the subculture of Chinese artists to which Lin Lin belonged. Many of his artist and painter friends came to the city in recent years to escape the political atmosphere in China, which they believed threatened their artistic development. And yet several artists said what happened to Lin Lin would be inconceivable in China, where violent street crime is almost nonexistent. 
 Since Mr. Lin's death, many young Chinese artists here have been asking themselves a fundamental question: Are the difficulties and dangers of life in New York City worth the artistic freedom for which they came?
"Lin Lin once gave an interview after the students were killed on Tiananmen square in Beijing," one friend, Zhang Hungtu, recalled. "He said that the students in China deserved our admiration because they lived in real danger while we live in safety, like in a strongbox, because we are in America."
Mr. Zhang, who came to this country nine years ago to pursue a career as a painter, pointed to a particular paradox: Lin Lin was so enchanted by life in New York, and particularly the neighborhood in which he lived, that he gave himself the pen name Billy Harlem.
"He loved this country," Mr. Zhang said. "He felt safe. But he is dead. It's a great shock."
 
A Talented Subculture
 Lin Lin, a graduate of the prestigious Zhejiang Art Academy in Hangzhou, China, who came here three years ago from Shanghai, belonged to a loosely knit group of Chinese painters who have come to New York in such numbers that they have made the city a major new center of Chinese art, certainly the largest in the world outside of China itself. Some of the artists say that New York is the most important place in the world these days for new Chinese art, having become for them what Paris was for many artists in the 1920's and 1930's -- a place where people could gather freely and experiment with new forms.
Some of the Chinese painters have found financial success and been taken on by major New York galleries. Most, however, have not. They talk about difficult lives, beset by economic and artistic challenges so that much of the initial glitter of New York has considerably faded. Yet returning to China, especially after the violent crackdown on the democracy movement there two years ago, is impossible for most of them.
 
'Broken Dreams'
 "After 10 years living here, I don't think there's so much opportunity," said Ai Weiwei, a painter and sculptor who was one of the first young Chinese artists to come to this country. "But people come here because they are always hoping to improve things for themselves even if they have to live in terrible circumstances. For example, Lin Lin's living conditions were worse than just about anything you would find in China."
Mr. Ai and other artists compare New York unfavorably with other centers of the Chinese artistic Diaspora like Paris and Zurich, where government subsidies and artists' housing are often available. But Chinese artists keep coming here, they say, and they stay because New York is still the place where dreams of success in the arts are made.
"Lin Lin's death shocked a lot of people because it could have been any of them," Mr. Ai said. "But a lot of people already had broken dreams."
Nobody seems to know exactly how many Chinese artists live here. Mr. Ai says there may be about 100; others say the figure is twice that, maybe more.
"Every artist wants to make it in New York," said Yan Li, a Chinese painter and poet who came here in 1985. "In China they can't express themselves. They have no way of exhibiting their work."
 
'They Feel Cut Off'
 Mr. Yan, who is also a poet and edits a poetry magazine called "First Line," which publishes the work of poets who have no outlet in China, says that Chinese artists confront not only practical problems, like surviving financially, but artistic problems stemming from their lack of the roots that are the very sources of their original inspiration.
"They feel cut off," he said, "and they need to change the styles that they have developed or were taught in China. But it's very difficult to change. It takes 10 years to develop a new style."
Many of the artists live in Flushing, where a large and varied community of recently arrived Chinese has sprouted in the past few years. Others live on the Lower East Side. A few, like Lin Lin, settled in narrow dilapidated flats in Harlem.
Financial difficulties led many of them to paint portraits on the street. That custom started about 10 years ago, when some artists used to set up easels on West Fourth Street and Sixth Avenue, until they were chased away by the police in Greenwich Village.
The technical training of these painters is generally quite rigorous; the schools they attended in China empasized such basic skills as sketching in charcoal. Because of their common backgrounds, some of the Chinese artists quickly developed a subculture within a subculture, learning the ways of life on the streets as they sought to earn spending money.
"Sometimes it was fun," Shen Chen, a painter from Beijing who came to this country in 1988, said of his days working on New York streets. "You practice your art making portraits. You learn English. You meet people from all over the world."
 
Getting Streetwise
 The artists learned where to go and when to go there. A typical day might include several hours in the afternoon drawing portraits in Central Park, Mr. Ai said. Then, a portrait artist might travel down to 34th Street to work for a few hours in the early evening outside Macy's. Later at night, he might venture over to Times Square, where, despite the dangers of the neighborhood, there are often many prospective customers late into the night. Several artists said that there were fewer police in Times Square after 11 P.M., so there was less risk of harassment by the officers there very late at night.
"Last year, I was arrested, handcuffed, fingerprinted, photographed and put in a cell with common criminals for an hour," said Hao Bing, a painter from Beijing who was doing portraits next to Lin Lin on the night of the shooting. "Sometimes the police are nice. They tell you to go away for 10 minutes because a supervisor is coming, and then to come back." But Mr. Hao also told of ethnic slurs hurled his way by police officers. "The police sometimes chase us down the street in their cars until we are out of breath," he said.
Another painter, Sunny Tu, who was also with Lin Lin the night of his death, said that he has tried to go to the Bureau of Consumer Affairs to get a peddler's license, but he has been refused.
"They only give peddler's licenses to veterans and the widows of veterans," said Mr. Tu, who originally came here from Hong Kong. "Painting portraits is a cash business, so they want us to pay taxes, and we are willing to pay taxes. But what can we do if we can't get licenses?"
"In every city, in Paris, Zurich, Toronto, it's a custom to support artists by letting them paint street portraits," Mr. Tu said. "Why can't they do the same thing in New York?"
But Lin Lin felt more kindly toward the city. "He liked New York a lot," Mr. Zhang said. "He thought it was a good place to be an artist.
"He felt safe in this country," Mr. Zhang said. "But he is dead. It's a great shock."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Chief Now Chairman At Chemical Waste

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Jerry E. Dempsey has been promoted to chairman of Chemical Waste Management Inc., the nation's largest hazardous-waste management company.
Mr. Dempsey, 58 years old, had been president and chief executive of the company, which is based in Oak Brook, Ill. He succeeds Dean L. Buntrock, who will remain the chairman and chief executive of Chemical Waste's parent, Waste Management Inc. 
 D. P. (Pat) Payne, a Waste Management senior vice president, replaces Mr. Dempsey as president and chief executive. Mr. Payne joined Waste Managment in August 1990 from I.B.M., where he was vice president and general manager for the Midwest region.
One analyst described the changes as a logical transfer of management duties at Waste Management, which plans to go public next year in Europe. Mr. Buntrock "has his hands full and is moving some of the responsibility," said Kay Hahn, director of research at the Chicago Corporation, an investment bank.
Waste Management owns 76 percent of Chemical Waste, which went public in 1986 and saw revenues nearly triple through 1990, when sales were $1.14 billion. During that period, net income more than tripled to $175 million in 1990.
Mrs. Hahn said Chemical Waste, the leader in its market "by a country mile," has grown with the industry as more and more substances have come under regulation requiring sophisticated handling and disposal methods. She added, however, that the industry's growth was stalled by the recession.
Mr. Dempsey said that one new direction the company is pursuing is the cleanup of contaminated Defense Department sites. Two years ago it established a subsidiary called Chem-Nuclear Environmental Services to develop its nuclear-waste management business.
"We see big opportunities in those Federal faciliites," he said.
Mr. Dempsey joined Waste Management in April 1984 as a director and vice chairman of the board, and was responsible for the company's strategic planning and long-range business development. He has been president and chief executive of Chemical Waste since July 1985 and has been a senior vice president of Waste Management since May 1988. Previously, Mr. Dempsey was president and chief operating officer of the Borg-Warner Corporation in Chicago, where he had worked since 1956.
Mr. Dempsey holds an M.B.A. from Georgia State University and a B.S. in mechanical engineering from Clemson University. He and his wife, Harriet, have three daughters.
During Mr. Payne's 11 years at I.B.M., he held a series of marketing and management positions, including administrative assistant to the chairman, and director of strategy evaluation in corporate finance and planning.
While Mr. Payne was senior vice president of Waste Management, his responsibilities included strategic planning, sales and marketing, information systems, human resources, quality programs and state government affairs.
Mr. Payne has a business administration degree from Texas A.& M. University. He and his wife, Patty, have two sons and a daughter.

HEADLINE: New York's McIntoshes Get the Jump on Autumn

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: CLAVERACK, N.Y., Aug. 27

 BODY:
Apples in August? Yes.
Ten days to two weeks ahead of schedule, before cold evenings have had a chance to bring a full red blush to the cheeks of McIntosh apples, the harvest has started in upstate New York. 
 An early spring and warm summer have speeded the maturing of apples and many other crops, despite a drought in July.
"In my 30 years as an apple grower, I have never picked a Mac in August before," said Russell Holze, a farmer on Schoolhouse Road here in Columbia County. "This year I'll have most of my Macs picked before the end of the month."
 
Cold Nights Needed
 Because of the early maturing, the McIntoshes, the most popular of all the apples grown in New York State, may be a little smaller than usual, as well as not as red.
"A touch of cold is very much needed," said Craig Telgheder, a fruit specialist of the Cooperative Extension Service in Columbia County. "The ideal weather during the harvest season is dry, sunny days with cold nights, which we are not going to get."
In the orchards on Mr. Holze's 150-acre fruit farm, the apples appeared to be about half red, not the three-quarters required for grading as extra fancy, the kind demanded by supermarket buyers. He has 12 workers picking this week, hoping to get the apples off the trees before they fall.
Standing under an apple tree in one of his orchards, Mr. Holze explained the economic problem of waiting for the fruit to reach the desired redness.
 
For Eating or Cider
 "If they color well and are picked, I can get $8 to $9 a bushel for them," he said. "If they drop and are sold for cider, I get $2 a bushel."
Despite the potential for loss, the general outlook is good for McIntoshes and about a dozen other varieties of apples grown in New York, according to the Agricultural Statistics Service in Albany.
It forecast that the 1991 crop in the state would be 1.01 billion pounds, up 2 percent from 990 millions pounds last year. Apple growers sold last year's crop for $80.6 million, the service said.
New York is the second leading apple state in the nation, behind Washington, which produces most of the nation's Red Delicious apples. This year's crop there was forecast at 4.6 billion pounds.
New Jersey and Connecticut produce so few apples commercially that they are not included in the state figures collected by the United States Department of Agriculture.
 
3 Major Apple Areas
 New York has three major apple-growing areas -- the Hudson Valley, the western shore of Lake Champlain and several counties on the south side of Lake Ontario.
Throughout the state the McIntosh is the leading apple grown, followed by later-maturing varieties like Rhode Island Greenings, Romes, Red Delicious, Idareds, Cortlands, Empires, Golden Delicious and Twenty Ounce.
But the McIntosh is in a decline, mainly because it falls when ripe, making an orderly harvest difficult. Up to two years ago, farmers used the chemical Alar to keep the fruit on trees longer.
With Alar now banned by the Federal Government, the impact on the harvesting of McIntoshes has been intensified by the warm weather this year, making the season earlier and shorter and requiring the hiring of more pickers.
Farmers are responding by replacing McIntosh trees with other varieties, like Jonamacs, an early apple, and later apples, like Empire and Cortland, according to Warren Smith, a fruit specialist for the Cooperative Extension Service in the Hudson Valley.
"They're easier to manage and not apt to drop their fruit when ripe," he said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Registered a Decline in August

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
Consumer confidence edged down in August with expectations for the economy over the next six months becoming less optimistic, the Conference Board reported today.
The decline in the New York business group's confidence index, to 76.3 from 77.7 in July, was the fourth in five months, following a postwar surge in March of more than 20 points. 
 "It's rather disappointing," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Board's Consumer Research Center. "While many of the economic indicators suggest that a recovery is in progress, the evidence will not be convincing until there is a substantial improvement in consumers' spirits."
The expectations component of the index, a predictive indicator for the economy, slipped to 96.3 at the August reading from 100.3 in July, with employment a particular concern. For the second straight month, there was a decline in the number of respondents who said they expected jobs to rise in the months ahead.
On the other hand, there was an improvement in the way the 5,000 households surveyed assessed current economic conditions. This component rose to 46.3 from 43.7 and 43.8 in June and July, respectively.
 
Results Taken in Stride
 Over all, economists and securities markets appeared to take the results in stride, with some analysts noting that confidence was lackluster for a year following the 1970 recession without signaling economic relapse.
"I don't think it's anything to worry about," said David S. Klein, an economist at Paine Webber Inc. "We're still well above the trough" of 55.1 percent confidence level reached in January.
In assessing general business conditions, 25.2 percent said they would be better six months from now, while 10.1 percent said they would be worse, and the rest said they would be about the same. Last month. 24.4 percent predicted improvement, and 9.5 percent predicted worsening conditions.
The percentage expecting greater job availability, however, shrank to 18.6 from 19.9, while a tighter job market was predicted by 18.5 percent, up from 18.1 percent.
"We're still getting a lot of worry about the job situation," said Mr. Linden.
For incomes, the Conference Board survey found 20 percent expecting increases, down from 23 percent, and 9.9 percent expecting decreases, up from 9 percent.
The other major compiler of data on consumer attitudes toward the economy, the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center, does not yet have full results of its August polling, which are to be sent to subscribers on Thursday.
But Professor Richard T. Curtin said today that it would "not be surprising" if they should parallel those of the Confernce Board. He added that the current "hiatus" in the improvement of consumer psychology was not unusual for this stage of the business cycle though it does suggest the recovery will be less vigorous than usual.
The Michigan expectations index is one of the 11 components of the Commerce Department's Index of Leading Indicators, which is intended to call turning points in the economy.
As for the consumer's view of present conditions, the Conference Board found 12.6 percent considered them good and 37.2 percent considered them bad; the comparable July figures were 12 percent and 37.3 percent.
For jobs, 8.8 percent believed them currently plentiful compared with 7.8 percent in July, while at the same time 38.6 percent believed them hard to get, up from 37.6 percent.
Edward Yardeni of C.J. Lawrence said that the rise in jobs-hard-to-get suggested that the nation's unemployment rate for August when reported on Sept. 6 could show a rise of one-tenth of a point from July's 6.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Construction Spending Up

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
An index of construction spending rose in July after a decline the month before, indicating that this important sector of the economy resumed a recovery begun earlier this year.
The F. W. Dodge division of McGraw-Hill Inc. said yesterday that its index of construction contract value rose 7 percent in July compared with June. 
 The gain lifted the rate of newly started construction slightly above its average for the second quarter, which was when the industry's recovery started, Dodge said. It said improvements were noted in both housing and nonresidential construction. Nonresidential building had sagged in June.
The value of newly started residential building rose 6 percent in July, extending an upward climb that began in February, Dodge said. By July, residential construction contracting was 25 percent above its January low, with virtually all of the gain in single-family homes.
Contracting for nonresidential buildings rose 2 percent, while the non-building category, which includes public works and utilities, jumped 19 percent. This category was helped by a $400 million contract for a utility plant in New Jersey, Dodge said.

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
Group of Seven Is Seen Backing Some Soviet Aid

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
When senior officials from industrialized nations meet this week to discuss aid to the Soviet Union, they are likely to disagree on whether to provide large-scale financial assistance but strongly endorse technical assistance and humanitarian aid.
Advice and training for Soviet officials seeking to rescue their country's foundering economy is vital to help officials there understand the country's troubles, said a senior Administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Technical assistance also provides a way to identify the problems and possible solutions while waiting for either the central Government or the republics to emerge as responsible recipients for aid, he added. 
 Humanitarian aid, including food, is likely to come sooner, the official said.
 
Food Aid 'Essential'
 Richard T. McCormack, who until recently was the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, said food aid "is essential, and to do that you've got to start moving reasonably early because of transportation lags."
The personal representatives of the leaders of seven richest industrialized nations are scheduled to meet Thursday in London. Deputies to the nations' finance ministers plan to meet a day later in Paris.
Mr. McCormack's successor at the State Department, Robert Zoellick, will represent the United States in London; David C. Mulford, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, will go to Paris. Besides France, Britain and the United States, the group of seven includes Canada, Germany, Italy and Japan.
Technical assistance includes drafting plans and training Soviet officials in Western techniques for monetary policy, banking, taxation, agriculture and transportation. Until recently, for example, ministries in Moscow controlled virtually all Soviet trade and few duties were assessed on their imports.
With many Soviet citizens and enterprises now engaged in international trade, the Soviet Union has been expanding customs offices at its borders, drafting a more detailed list of import tariffs and seeking the International Monetary Fund's help in organization.
Latvia, which declared its independence from the Soviet Union last week, will seek Peace Corps volunteers to teach English and basic business skills there. And the World Bank today announced a trust fund to pay for training programs.
But experts warn that if the Soviet authorities are unable to control Government spending, allow markets to determine prices and provide a stable currency, technical assistance may have little effect. "It's like riding bicycles in the wrong direction on a superhighway filled with trucks," Mr. McCormack said. "The trucks just crush the bicycles."
 
Political Complications
 But providing technical assistance has been complicated by the political upheaval in the Soviet Union. The I.M.F., for example, had been expected to oversee much of the effort, but is not sure whom to deal with in the Soviet Union.
After extensive negotiations, the international lending agency was expecting the heads of the Soviet Finance Ministry and central bank to arrive next week with a detailed list of needs. But Finance Minister Vladimir Y. Orlov and Viktor V. Gerashchenko, chairman of the Soviet central bank, were both implicated in last week's coup.

GORBACHEV THREATENS TO QUIT UNLESS REPUBLICS FIND A WAY TO PRESERVE A MODIFIED UNION;
NEW PACT IS SOUGHT

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 27

 BODY:
Fighting to stem the flight of republics from a disintegrating nation, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said he had won agreement today from two major republics to keep some kind of Soviet Union and threatened to resign if efforts at unity failed.
Mr. Gorbachev said the leaders of the Russian federated republic and Kazakhstan, the largest of the republics in area, had agreed with him and the President of Kirghizia on the need for an early signing of a revised treaty between the Kremlin and those republics willing to stay in the union. Such a revised agreement would determine what kind of political and economic structure would emerge from the current crisis -- a federation, or a commonwealth, for instance.
 
Break by Another Republic
 But even as he announced this agreement, another republic said it wanted its independence. Moldavia, situated on the border with Romania, with which it was long associated in the past, announced its independence from the union, the third republic to do so since the failed coup in Moscow last week. 
 With some of his old combative zest, Mr. Gorbachev today urged the Soviet Parliament today to help mount a rescue effort, and negotiate a new union treaty to define relationships between the republics and the central government and thus save the Soviet Union from total collapse, or face his departure.
"If something else comes about, I will simply raise the question of my resignation," he said, addressing the Supreme Soviet. [Transcript, pages A8 and A9.]
Mr. Gorbachev, his voice raised in urgency, warned that without a new treaty to replace the one that was to have been signed last week, the Soviet Union was on the verge of disintegration, with frightening consequences for itself and its neighbors.
 
Error Would Be Too Costly
 "This collapse threatens the lives and property of millions of people, and of the defense potential of our country, which is a superpower," he said. "We do not have the right to make a mistake of this proportion."
At today's meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian federated republic, President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev of the Kazakh republic and President Askar Akayev of the Kirghiz republic said they would continue negotiations, Mr. Gorbachev said.
Mr. Gorbachev said that "our common point is that the U.S.S.R. should be maintained as a union of sovereign states. Everyone is in favor of a unified defense, a unified armed forces."
A statement issued by Tass later said the four "expressed hope that the earliest signing of the union treaty with the necessary amendments, dictated by a new situation in the country, will help promote political stabilization and open wide vistas for the unimpeded carrying out of reforms, the creation of a single market, conclusion of an economic agreement between all 15 sovereign republics."
"Serious doubts were expressed during the conversation over the expediency of creating separate national armies, except for the possible formation of small national guard units," the statement said. "This approach is dictated by the fact that the Soviet Union is a nuclear power."
 
Status of Baltic Republics
 What seemed to be emerging was an agreement to seek some kind of political arrangement for those republics willing to remain under Kremlin leadership, with an acknowledgment that the three Baltic republics, which have now won European recognition, are probably gone from the union. But Mr. Gorbachev was clearly hoping to include the Baltic republics in any economic community that might be forged.
It was uncertain that the optimism Mr. Gorbachev conveyed to the Parliament about negotiating a new treaty would be borne out. As he left the meeting, Mr. Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan said he had "no special optimism" that a solution was in sight on a new treaty that would keep the republics bound in a political union.
Nevertheless, there seemed to be some backlash in the country against the hasty actions taken in the wake of the failed coup, and this movement appeared to help out Mr. Gorbachev.
In the Soviet Parliament today, a number of liberal politicians expressed alarm at the political unraveling taking place across the country. Mayor Anatoly A. Sobchak of Leningrad called it a "suicidal process."
 
Warnings of Disintegration
 From the podium, deputies warned of the "Balkanization" of the country, particularly after the warning by the Russian republic yesterday that it would seek a review of existing borders if neighboring republics with large Russian populations break away from the union.
As the drive for independence spread to republics where the Communists are still in control -- such as Byrelorussia and the Central Asian republics, some interpreted their actions as a political dodge to avoid the radical reforms now expected to come from the Gorbachev-Yeltsin coalition in the Kremlin.
"These announcements of the splitting up of the Soviet Union without any preliminary agreement, through unilateral proclamations of independence, this is a continuation of the putsch, already in different forms," Mr. Sobchak said.
 
Quest for Political Gains
 By pushing for greater sovereignty, republic leaders, in many cases recent Communists, were seen to be using the opportunity created by the mounting political chaos to gain political capital with a radical nationalist stance.
By moving rapidly to claim dominance over the Soviet Government in the aftermath of the coup, the Russian republic, led by Mr. Yeltsin, has cast a shadow over the fate of new union, giving rise to old fears of Russian chauvinism.
Mr. Nazarbayev, who only 10 days ago was negotiating with Mr. Yeltsin for closer economic ties between their two republics, today told reporters that he could not support a Russian Government claim to be "first among equals."
"The President and Prime Minister are Russian and now we hear that they might agree for the vice president to be from Central Asia," he said. "Well, thanks a lot," he added wrily.
 
Division of Authority
 Before the coup, the Russian republic, Kazakhstan and others were poised to sign a treaty that has been under negotiation for four months outlining the division of responsibilities between Moscow and the republics, giving the regions more control over their own policies and economies. But after the week's tumultuous events, all parties -- including Mr. Gorbachev -- have agreed that the old treaty is now inadequate, and must be redrafted to reflect the republics' demands for greater independence.
Only 9 of the Soviet Union's 15 republics had participated in the previous round of talks on a new union treaty; the other 6 -- the Baltic states, Georgia, Moldavia and Armenia -- had already declared their intention to leave the union, although each had a different timetable.
Mr. Gorbachev said again today he would not move to keep republics in the union against their will, but he argued that secession should take place under the aegis of a new treaty and the new Soviet Constitution that would include the provisions of the treaty.
But with more and more foreign states recognizing the independence of the Baltic republics, the process has already begun to take its own course, leaving Mr. Gorbachev to deal with an unwelcome reality. Today in an interview with reporters, Mr. Gorbachev chided the Baltic republics and the countries that have recognized them for making "hasty decisions."
In the last few days, the Parliaments of the Ukraine, then Byelorussia and now Moldavia moved to declare independence. Kazakhstan has declared itself in favor of a commonwealth arrangement, while in Uzbekistan, the chairman of the parliament has called for preparation of an independence declaration that would be submitted to a vote.
Today, in Moldavia, a republic of 4.5 million people, of whom two-thirds are ethnic Romanians, crowds gathered in the main square of the capital, Kishinev, to cheer the official declaration of "full, immediate" independence voted by the parliament.
In interviews this week, Mircea Snegur, the president of Moldavia, said independence was only a step towards Moldavia's ultimate goal, which he said is reunification with Romania. Like the Baltic republics, Moldavia was absorbed by the Soviet Union in 1940 under the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. Today, in Bucharest, the Romanian Government recognized Moldavian independence within moments of its announcement.
For advocates of the union treaty, the most troublesome moves towards independence this week came from the Ukraine, a republic second only to the Russian federation in population, located in a strategic position on the Soviet Union's southern and western borders and well-stocked with weapons from the Soviet military's formidable arsenal. Without the Ukraine and Byelorussia, the two other Slavic republics, Russia could find itself in a union in which the largely Muslim republics of Central Asia would play a dominant role.
A spokesman for Mr. Yeltsin said on Monday Russia would call for a review of its borders, if neighboring republics with large Russian populations leave the union. That would affect the Ukraine, which includes the Crimea, largely populated by Russians. The Yeltsin statement on borders also alarmed Kazakh leaders, since their republic also has a large Russian population.
 
Specter of Yugoslavia
 That statement added new alarm to the crisis, raising the specter of a repeat of the Yugoslav crisis. That country's republics are now warring over disputed territory.
Speaking to Parliament today, Mr. Gorbachev warned against any discussions of internal border changes. "I want this discussion to be ended," he said. "The draft treaty says that borders cannot be changed."
He also defended Mr. Yeltsin and the Russian government against charges of chauvinism and power-grabbing. "The Russians are concerned about consolidating the defeat they dealt the putsch," said Mr. Gorbachev. "Today, we hear that they are trying to implement the Russian empire. But the Russians have no such intention."
He also praised the army for resisting the coup, saying this was a testament to the reforms that have taken place in the military over the last few years. "The army did not go along with the plotters," he said. "Let us pay them their due. Perestroika gave birth to a new army."
 
Credit for Defeat of Coup
 Democratic reforms in society were also instrumental in paving the way for the popular resistance to the coup, Mr. Gorbachev said. "If we had not gone down the path of democratization, the putschists would have dealt very easily with perestroika," he said.
While warning against anti-Communist hysteria, Mr. Gorbachev today called on Communists to form a new party to support the democratic transition -- yet another death blow to the party that until last week was still the dominant political force in the country.
The Soviet press agency Tass today announced that the chief coup plotters are being charged with "betrayal of the motherland," a capital crime under Soviet law.
Meanwhile, reformers continued to stake out new positions in the wake of the defeat of the coup last week. Today, the former editor of Moscow News, Yegor Yakovlev, was named to head the Government broadcasting company, which controls central television and radio channels.
 
A Bastion of Free Speech
 Mr. Yakovlev's newspaper, a weekly published in Russian and several foreign languages, was one of the first to test the limits of Mr. Gorbachev's policy of openness and free speech, publishing articles about Soviet politics and history that were a sensation five years ago. He replaces Leonid Kravchenko, named to the post last winter when Mr. Gorbachev began shifting towards the conservative camp.
Under Mr. Kravchenko, central television dropped popular programs that carried free-wheeling political debates, and returned to the format of an earlier era, alternating between lengthy lectures by public officials and light popular music. Its news program, "Vremya," became a vehicle for the new conservative slant on events, prompting millions of viewers to switch their allegiance to the Russian channel, and its news program "Vesti."
In Parliament today, deputies readied for the opening next week of the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies, which has been charged with a major overhaul of government in the wake of last week's coup.
 
Gorbachev Dominates Session
 But the main feature of the day's lengthy debates was again Mr. Gorbachev, who after addressing the Parliament yesterday, returned today for a question-and-answer session.
Although still visibly chastened by his diminished political role, Mr. Gorbachev -- who last weekend resigned as General Secretary of the Communist Party -- came to the podium, fired with alarm over the state of the union.
"There is a real threat of the collapse of the Soviet state," he said, "and I say this with enormous anxiety and urgency."
He showed his old impatience at the meandering debates that have filled the Parliament for the last two days. "While we are sitting here, everything is getting weaker, collapsing," he said.
For Mr. Gorbachev, as for the union itself, the stakes are enormous, as he tries to rein in the forces let loose in the aftermath of the coup. "He is President," said Mr. Sobchak. "If he can not solve this issue, then he should leave."
But some deputies were gloomy about the prospect of halting the Union's slide. "Right now this is an uncontrollable process," said Konstantin Lyubenchikov, a liberal deputy. "Gorbachev does not have enough authority to stop it, and the Supreme Soviet is embroiled in a struggle."
"Honestly speaking, I don't believe that any effort on Gorbachev's part to hold the center can be successful," he said."I am afraid this powerful struggle could continue, and cause serious damage."

New to Yanks, New to City, Old Hand in Cutting a Deal

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN

 BODY:
After a hastily planned flight from North Carolina, baseball's newest millionaire, Brien Taylor, was finally able to rest with his family at a Manhattan hotel yesterday afternoon. They needed it.
In the previous 24 hours, a long-awaited deal with the New York Yankees had transformed Taylor from a 19-year-old would-be junior college pitcher to the highest paid player in the history of baseball's amateur draft.
 
Studied the Rules
 His plans had been altered, literally, overnight. The direction of his career had changed. Everything had changed, that is, except his family's sensibilities. Bettie Taylor, the mother of the left-handed pitcher who will soon be $1.55 million richer, stared at the movable table of empty room-service plates. 
 "Fifty dollars," her son said quietly, in wonder.
"Can you believe that?" Mrs. Taylor said, her tone rising with each word.
Mrs. Taylor's indignation over an expensive, though suddenly affordable, meal is entirely consistent with the character of the woman who as much as anyone was responsible for the record-setting deal her son will sign in New York today.
In a matter of months, Mrs. Taylor, a crab processor from Beaufort, N.C., made a quick study of the baseball industry and led her family through complex, intense and sometimes acrimonious negotiations with the most famous organization in professional sports.
The force of her will when confronting Yankee vice president and General Manager Gene Michael led to a stunning spiral in the Yankees' long-standing offer from $650,000 to the final agreement in a matter of days.
"Bettie Taylor, when she met with Gene Michael, was ready," said Scott Boras, the California-based agent who has advised the family since the Yankees drafted Taylor in June. "She was confident. She was fully apprised of the idiosyncrasies of major league baseball rules, the major league marketplace for draft picks, the value of Brien Taylor to teams other than the Yankees, and the varied options available to him if he attended college."
Taylor's contract firmly established a million-dollar value for a teen-age prospect whose triumphs have been limited to high school games, the latest distressing development for baseball executives seeking to limit the size of contracts.
As a result,their work could have a profound affect on athletes at a level that once held the least negotiating leverage -- high school athletes faced with choice of a college or a major league organization. While highly publicized lucrative contracts in the late 1950's and early 60's led to the establishment of the amateur draft in 1965, the entry-level contracts have often been dwarfed by free-agent agreements secured by veteran players.
But these days outstanding pitching is at an ever-increasing premium, which can only rise again when the National League adds two expansion clubs for the 1993 season.
The high school market first jumped beyond a million dollars last year when a Texas high school pitcher named Todd Van Poppel, also represented by Boras, signed a deal with the Oakland Athletics for $1.2 million. Although the Taylor family insisted that Brien deserved the same kind of money, the Yankees resisted, and baseball executives across the country held out hope that the Yankees could hold the line against escalating salaries.
 
Met With Michael
 Mrs. Taylor's relationship with the Yankees could have reached the breaking point in late July, after she wondered publicly whether the long impasse in contract negotiations may have been the result of an effort by the Yankees to take advantage of a poor, black family.
She maintained today that her thought had been misinterpreted as a suggestion that Michael was acting in a racist manner. "I'm a poor black woman," she said. "Why would that thought occur to me? It was just a thought, and I expressed it."
Mrs. Taylor said that her questions were erased upon meeting Michael a week ago, during a one-on-one meeting in a home economics room at East Carteret High School in Beaufort.
"He seemed like a nice guy," she remembered, "and he seemed not really all that different from where we were coming from. He gave me the impression. Maybe there was a time in his life when things were not great, either."
The suddenly open lines of communication gave the two sides an opportunity to solve an issue that became more complicated than money. In addition to the money (which Taylor will receive in two installments, one this year and one next), the Taylors wanted a major league contract, which would have guaranteed that Taylor could rise to the major league level in three years. The Yankees had insisted that such a demand would have required the organization to unnecessarily protect Taylor before his arrival in the major leagues, and could have led to the loss of more experienced players, particularly in the expansion draft next year.
Last Saturday, during a discussion between Boras and Michael, the obstacle began to be removed when the agent said the biggest consideration was the money, not the type of contract.
"At that point," Boras remembered, "Gene, I believe, said, 'You mean you're not demanding a major-league contract?' "
Boras and the family eventually arrived at a higher money figure to compensate for their concession. The Yankees agreed to a separate letter that claimed the organization would not take advantage of a clause in the standard minor league contract that allows an agreement to be voided within a 90-day period in the event of an injury. Taylor is scheduled to undergo a physical today to demonstrate that such a clause is uncecessary.
By the 10 hours of negotiations on Monday, fax transmissions were flying in all directions, to and from points extending coast-to-coast: the Yankee offices in the Bronx, the commissioner's office in Manhattan, Boras's hotel in Atlanta and his office in Southern California.
There would be a deal. Boras glanced at his watch at 5:55 Monday afternoon, and suddenly remembered a potential deal-breaker that would have been as comical as it was expensive.
 
Awaiting Instructions
 Mrs. Taylor had wanted to know by 6 P.M. if she should attempt to reach her son at Louisburg with instructions for Tuesday morning: Either attend the tennis class, and thereby reduce the Yankee opportunity to sign him, according to baseball regulations, to a small period next spring. Or he should prepare to come home.
Boras remembered telling Yankee vice president Leonard Kleinman: "You know, I almost forgot. You better call Bettie Taylor and advise her we have a deal in principle. Otherwise we might not be able to get a hold of Brien, and he'll go to class."
The connection was made. Bettie Taylor told her son he was coming home only to turn around and head for New York.
The airplane departed from North Carolina yesterday morning. Suddenly Taylor and his parents possessed first-class tickets to a new world. As if by magic, there would suddenly appear grown men waiting to carry his luggage, hotel food delivered to his door for the asking, and the promise of a long-awaited trip to Yankee Stadium scheduled to take place this afternoon. There will be introductions, and a tour, and his signature on a $1.55 million contract, the richest an amateur player has signed in the history of the game.
First, however, as the plane eased lower and lower in its final approach to La Guardia, there was a small problem with Taylor's first visit to New York City. Where was it? "I saw the water," Taylor said softly, with more wonder than fear. "I kept looking for the landing strip. I said, 'I don't see a landing strip."'
And then, like everything else in the previous 18 hours, it was there. After twelve weeks of strategic diversions, verbal storms and unscheduled delays in an economic relationship with the Yankees, Taylor finally made his smooth landing.

'Metallica'
Metallica's first album in three years has squashed all opposition on the charts. In its first week, "Metallica" sold 2.2 million copies, easily moving into the top slot on Billboard's charts and bumping another Elektra act, Natalie Cole, into the No. 2 position. "Metallica" outsold Ms. Cole's "Unforgettable" 3 to 1. The Wiz had its biggest single-day sale in 10 years with the album, and other major chains also reported record-breaking sales. 
 "In my 20-year career, I have never seen a record go this quickly," said Kenny Hamlin, the senior vice president for sales at Elektra Records. "Based on the history of the band and our projections for it, we were prepared, but we did have to place an additional production order. We had ordered 1.4 million copies originally, but on top of that initial shipment, we received a reorder for 800,000 copies in the next 4 days."
That the top two records in America are a hard-rock album and an album of standards makes nothing clear culturally but does underscore a reversal of fortunes for Elektra Records, which had a dry period before Ms. Cole's success. In the short history of the new tabulating system for Billboard's charts, huge early sales -- as for N.W.A.'s "Efil4zaggin" -- have often been followed by a precipitate fall from first place after hard-core fans leave the record stores. "Metallica," a more mainstream album than usual for the band, seems calculated to go further, and the band's managers, Cliff Burnstein and Peter Mensch, are generally thought of as being among the shrewdest in the hard-rock business.
 
Cajun Music
 When Luderin Darbone, the violinist, started his band, the Hackberry Ramblers, in 1933 in southwest Louisiana, the term Cajun was derogatory. Things have changed for Mr. Darbone, who is 79 years old. "My dad and mother talked French when I was growing up," Mr. Darbone said in a telephone interview from his home in Sulphur, La. "When it was time to start school, my mother said, 'There won't be any more French, just English.' People looked down on Cajun people. Now the name is an honor in this part of the country."
The band, which is playing its first show outside Louisiana in nearly 30 years this weekend at Tramps, presents a strange hybrid of Western swing, jazz, Cajun and country music that reflects some of the cultural and economic pressures to assimilate that French-speaking people felt in the 1930's. Mr. Darbone, who moved to Texas with his parents (his father worked in the oil industry), began learning country tunes at dances. When the family moved back to Louisiana they settled in Hackberry, close to the Duhone family. Edward Duhone, the guitarist and accordionist, who will also be at Tramps, and Mr. Darbone became friends and musical compatriots. Mr. Duhone, who is 81, brought Cajun music to the duo. Though they were one of the most popular bands in French-speaking Louisiana, they kept their day jobs and never traveled much out of the area.
"I figure Tramps is hiring us to play Cajun music, so 90 percent of what we play will be Cajun, plus some instrumentals and a country number or two," Mr. Darbone said. "I liked country better, but now Cajun music is going nationwide and we have lots of demand for it, and I really enjoy it. We get regular festival jobs in Louisiana, but mostly we now donate our time playing for the elderly or at nursing homes. It's like therapy to them. Most of those people used to come to our dances and now they're in wheelchairs. It makes us feel good to see them tapping their feet or getting out of the chairs to make a few dance steps."
 
The Illustrated Dead
 The Grateful Dead are as iconic as any band around, and their songs are filled with visions of loners, criminals and drifters. The Dead's album covers and concert posters have always had a relationship to the comic culture of the group's home town, San Francisco, so it's no surprise to find that Kitchen Sink Comix (No. 2 Swamp Road, Princeton, Wis. 54968) has commissioned a new line called Grateful Dead Comix. Issue No. 1 features four songs -- "Dire Wolf," "Terrapin Station," "One More Saturday Night" and "Casey Jones" -- set to illustrations. It has sold 50,000 copies.
"Several members in the band are comics fans," said Denis Kitchen, the publisher. "Jerry Garcia is avid, and when the band first made a bit of money, he bought a complete set of EC Comics. He's followed underground comics, and he'd wanted to do it for 20 years."
The first edition, printed on recycled paper and using soybean ink ("a very tasty product if stir-fried with a little tarragon and basil," reads a small note in the beginning of the comic), was pleasing enough to the band for Kitchen Sink to plan an indefinite series. And where the first issue reproduces the songs visually, other issues will illustrate anecdotes, or review concerts; the possibilities will be endless. The first four issues will be collected and released by Disney Books.
"Of all the bands out there playing, we could most naturally tap into the Dead," Mr. Kitchen said. "The cartoonists are in the same age group as the band. We all started in the late 1960's. Just like the band are fans of underground comics, the cartoonists were fans of the band. And I just read in Newsweek the band has grossed the most of any touring band this year. So the audience is there. We know that."

Calypso, Past and Present, As Two Veterans See It

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
Kavery Dutta's "One Hand Don't Clap," opening today at the Village East Cinema, is a sweet, lilting documentary on the history and present state of calypso and its more recent spinoff, soca, defined as calypso with soul.
Ms. Dutta concentrates on two key figures: Lord Kitchener, born 70-some years ago in Trinidad as Aldwyn Roberts, who introduced calypso to London in 1948, becoming an internationally known performing artist and composer, and Calypso Rose, born in Tobago in 1940 as McCartha Sandy, who is said to be the first woman to become calypso star. 
 They are a most engaging pair, whether seen on screen separately or together. Lord Kitchener, a big man with a wide, toothy smile, talks easily about the Afro-Caribbean origins of calypso, what he thinks of soca and Harry Belafonte's influence on making calypso popular in the 1950's.
Calypso Rose, who looks a little like a Caribbean version of Roseanne Barr, has something of Ms. Barr's humor and, when interviewed, her self-conscious gravity.
Both performers, though, only really come to life when they are performing. The film carries snatches of the two singers on the soundtrack throughout the film, and some complete numbers done for the camera.
Sitting at a Trinidad racetrack, Lord Kitchener and an old pal, Lord Pretender, talk about their early days. Both express reservations about today's calypso style. Lord Pretender has no time for lyrics that don't rhyme and what he sees as the laziness of the singers, "A man sing a line, the music play five minutes."
Calypso Rose, who now lives in New York, feels strongly about the social importance of her songs, which, as she says, carry on the calypso tradition of "domestical, spiritual, economical and political" commentary. Her show-stopping moment onstage is strictly domestical. Wearing a gold lame pants suit, she sings and shakes her way through "Solomon," a bawdy number about a man who is thoroughly no good.
Lord Kitchener's great moment arrives near the end of the film when he appears on the stage of the Calypso Revue, his club in Port of Spain, to sing and dance "Pillow Fight," which uproariously recalls another battle between the sexes.
"One Hand Don't Clap" uses the carnival in Trinidad as its climactic sequence, crosscutting among the various calypso events, featuring new performers, and the great Mardi Gras parade in Port of Spain.
There is one major problem for anyone whose ear is not attuned to the Caribbean accent: many of the calypso lyrics and a lot of the words in the interviews are virtually unintelligible. Reviewers were furnished with a dialogue script.
The film's title is taken from a remark made by Calypso Rose when she acknowledges that without the help and advice of Lord Kitchener, she would never have reached the top. As she tells her mentor, "One hand don't clap."
 
One Hand Don't Clap

HEADLINE: As Life Changes, So Does Freshman Orientation

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
A college education used to begin with a quick and casual freshman orientation: There usually was a barbecue, followed by a big dance and finally a rambling campus tour led by a bored sophomore.
Now orientation has evolved into an intense social and intellectual initiation that combines aspects of academic boot camp and cultural finishing school. 
 These programs, which are being instituted at hundreds of colleges and universities for the first time this year, are comprehensive, well-structured courses that can last up to a year, not small-scale experiments like AIDS seminars or study skills classes that many institutions have been trying.
They mark the growing realization among administrators that real-world problems, like race relations, are intruding on campus life more and more. They also realize that the entire freshman-year experience is crucial to a student's chances for success and a college's ability to sustain enrollment, particularly at a time when one of three freshmen does not return to the same school for sophomore year.
 
Outside the Curriculum
 While still including basic introductions like class registration and a library run-through, freshmen orientations on many campuses this week are exposing new students at once to delicate subjects like date rape, drug abuse, race relations and how freshmen, some from small towns and tiny high schools, are supposed to deal with them.
"It has been a surprise," one freshman, J. Dale Cannedy from Midland, Tex., said of his first few days at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., where orientation lasts three weeks. "They treat you much more like an adult. They're not afraid to broach the subjects of sexuality, substance abuse and harassment."
While colleges and universities are concerned with preparing first-year students for campus life, they have another motive for paying special attention to freshmen. Colleges, now scrambling to fill their classes, hate to lose students they might have retained.
"The economics of higher education helped produce this, and anyone who doesn't admit it is not telling the truth," said Richard K. Matthews, a professor of government at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., who directs the study program for first-year students. "This is a much more competitive market."
 
Freshmen Get 'Our Best'
 Lehigh pampers freshmen throughout the year by overturning some fairly common traditions. While freshman survey classes at Lehigh were once taught in large lecture halls by junior faculty, the college of arts and sciences this year has set aside 34 seminars in which enrollment is limited to 16 freshmen and only full-time faculty will be allowed to teach.
"We want them to have our best," Professor Matthews said.
Freshmen have not always been treated with such care. John N. Gardner, vice chancellor of the University of South Carolina at Columbia, has studied the freshman-year experience at colleges around the country for more than 15 years. In previous generations, he said, first-year students, feeling lost and overwhelmed, lived in the oldest dorms, ate the worst food, sat in the largest lecture halls and generally were left to sink or swim.
Professor Gardner said such a policy might have worked when most freshmen were more or less alike: privileged white men whose parents were college-educated. But that changed as colleges admitted more and more women, and again when minority students and those from lower-income families, with varying degrees of academic preparedness, arrived on campus.
 
Basic Training of Sorts
 Suddenly, orientation had to be taken seriously as a kind of basic training for students. The strategy appears to have been succeessful. Professor Gardner said studies by many institutions, including South Carolina, have shown that students who participate in orientation have a significantly higher survival rate and are more likely to graduate than those who founder through the first critical weeks on campus alone.
Professor Gardner conceded that since participation at orientation often is voluntary, students who joined organizations and did well in high school -- and thus who could be expected to survive well at college in the first place -- might be more likely to take part in orientation. But he said that research at the University of South Carolina had shown that high school students who took part in many activities were neither more nor less likely to take part in freshman orientation.
At the University of South Carolina, freshmen receive one of the most thorough orientations, a semester-long course called University 101, which has become a model for many other institutions. It is a three-credit elective, graded on a pass-fail basis, in which students are taught scholastic basics like how to use the library, and modern college survival skills like dealing with acquaintance rape. Students are graded on the papers they write and exams they take.
 
Tackling Moral Issues
 If University 101 represents the hard-line approach to orientation, the University of Pennsylvania's Bacchae project is the soft sell, focusing on academic preparation but also subtly counseling students on modern moral issues.
The principle underlying the project is the need to introduce students to an intellectual life in which ideas are lived, not just learned. Penn freshmen read the classic Greek drama "The Bacchae" about the ancient cult of Dionysus and discuss it in their dorms and in seminar groups. Some elective courses will cover the play, which will be performed next spring.
"Many of these students may never have sat around a table and talked about a book," said Norman T. Adler, associate dean for the School of Arts and Sciences. "My job is to show these kids the passion of the mind."
Selecting such a canonical work of Western civilization as "The Bacchae" by Euripides nearly killed the project, but many faculty members first objected to the ancient drama because it seemed antithetical to current concerns over multiculturalism. Later, these faculty members agreed that the play's treatment of cults, religions and beliefs touched on many cultures and made it contemporary.
 
Provocative Drama at Cornell
 While Penn's project ends with the production of a play, a similar project at Cornell begins with a provocative drama. During orientation, incoming students watched a live performance of "Miss Evers' Boys," a play, based on an actual incident, about a group of black men who became unwitting medical guinea pigs for a Federal study of syphilis. The freshmen then break into small groups, continuing the discussion in their dorms.
Cornell officials say they hope that by talking about the ethical issues raised in the play, which was written by David Feldshuh, a Cornell professor, new students will come to understand people who are different from themselves.
Officials at the University of Louisville have found that it sometimes is easier to reach students by promising fun rather than facts. Dr. Madelyn J. Jacobs, the university's director of student health services, said that for years she delivered serious dorm talks about contraceptives. Men showed up in droves but women generally stayed away.
Three years ago, Dr. Jacobs started a new session for the women that she advertised as a pajama party. Sitting on the floor, she chats with them about college life while gently steering the conversation to the serious topics of contraception, sexuality and AIDS.
"It takes a little longer to get the conversation to where we were headed, but when we get there it really means something to them," Dr. Jacobs said.
Dr. Jacobs said the encounter sessions have helped raise the awareness of date rape at Louisville and the willingness of women not to be silent victims of it. In 1989, there were 11 reported incidents. Last year, after orientation covered rape for the first time, the number of reports increased to 60, suggesting to college officials that women were more likely to report a rape, not that more rapes had occurred.
 
Over the Mountains
 Freshmen at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Wash., learn something about themselves by hiking along a mountain ridge for three days. Robert H. Stremba, director of counseling and co-ordinator of the backpacking program, remembered one student's surprise at having hiked over a mountain with a heavy backpack for the first time. "He told me, 'Now that I know I can do that, I know I can do other things, like taking a couple of midterms in one week,' " Mr. Stremba said.
The academic portion of Puget Sound's orientation is based on a successful and widely copied program at Bard College. Bard freshmen spend the last three weeks of summer on campus reading critically, writing intensively and discussing controversial topics like censorship and bilingualism.
The program appears to have been instrumental in helping Bard keep its students. Before it began in 1981, about 70 percent of the freshman class came back the second year, a rate slightly better than the national average. After the program's start, the retention rate rose to 85 percent.
The benefits of these sophisticated new orientation programs may not be immediately evident to the freshmen themselves. Margaret G. O'Connell, a sophomore from Wilmington, Vt., said she felt she had not gained much from her three-week intellectual summer camp during her tumultuous first year at Bard. But returning this summer to tutor new students in the program made her think otherwise. It was much easier for her to organize her thoughts, form opinions and deal with new people than it was for this year's freshmen, she said.
"In retrospect," Miss O'Connell said, "I see how much all that helped. At the time I just didn't want to do it."

HEADLINE: Polite Robber, Kind Till End, Goes to Police

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
An unemployed oil company worker surrendered to the police today in a widely publicized conclusion to a case that involved a string of nearly 100 robberies of hotel guests in Texas and Louisiana, all said to have been commited by a criminal dubbed the "gentleman bandit" by law-enforcement officers.
The authorities said the robberies were carried out by a man distinguished by his dapper attire and courteous manner, who was said to have apologized profusely to his victims, sometimes calling them at home to be sure they had recovered from the ordeal and once calling an ambulance for a man who had a heart attack during a robbery. 
 A statement circulated Friday by lawyers for the man who surrendered to the police, Lon B. Perry, 49 years old, said his action was motivated by pangs of conscience after he learned in June that another man fitting his description had been arrested for the robberies, which occurred over two years.
The surrender was attended by a throng of reporters and jostling photographers, many of them in town for the beginning of the trial of Wanda Webb Hollaway, who allegedly tried to win a spot on a high school cheerleading squad for her daughter by arranging the murder of a rival's mother.
 
Tabloids and Public Radio
 Representatives of everything from British tabloids to the syndicated television show "A Current Affair" to National Public Radio gathered outside police headquarters to await the arrival of the man who reportedly took the names and addresses of all the people he robbed, promising to pay them back someday.
In a statement made public by his lawyer, Allen C. Isbell, Mr. Perry asserted that he had fallen into a deep depression after being laid off as a computer programmer at the Texas Eastern Corporation, an oil and gas pipeline company, in December 1988.
In the statement, Mr. Perry contended that he turned to robbery when he found himself nearing age 50, with a son in college, a mortgage and back taxes to pay, and without the necessary background needed to switch to a job in computers with another company.
Mr. Isbell had announced Friday that Mr. Perry would turn himself in today after spending the weekend saying goodbye to his family.
"He wanted to turn himself in right away, but we advised him to negotiate a plea before he did so," he said. "He will plead guilty to several of the robberies, and will help police clear the rest of them with his confession, in exchange for a 35-year sentence."
Mr. Perry was charged with two counts of aggravated robbery and was being held in city jail on $200,000 bond, said Sgt. Richard Retz.
Speaking about the intense news media fascination with the case, Rick Hartley, a spokesman for the Houston police, said, "They say they're here for the cheerleader trial, but they all seem to love this case."
As one television cameraman explained it: "He lost a job in the oil business. He was friendly and nice when he robbed people. How Texan can you get?"

HEADLINE: Bush Approves Storm-Relief Aid in 2 States

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 27

 BODY:
President Bush today authorized Federal disaster aid for Rhode Island and Massachusetts as a result of damage to public property by last week's hurricane.
He designated both states as major disaster areas. 
 In Rhode Island, the action makes Federal assistance available to help restore public services in all of the state's affected counties. In Massachusetts, the aid will be used in four eastern counties -- Barnstable, Bristol, Essex and Middlesex.
In both states, Federal funds will be made available in affected areas for disaster unemployment compensation for workers who lose their jobs as a result of the hurricane.
The American Insurance Services Group Inc., a trade group, estimated on Monday that the hurricane caused $780 million damage to insured property when it swept up the East Coast on Aug. 18 and 19.
Over all, the largest losses occurred in Massachusetts, with $525 million in insured damage; followed by Rhode Island, $115 million; New York State, $75 million; Connecticut, $40 million; Maine, $21 million, and North Carolina, $4 million.

Whitehurst's Collapse Gives Mets One More To Forget About

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
For Wally Whitehurst, the chance he waited a lifetime for has become the fiasco he can't end.
Whitehurst, after a long and dutiful apprenticeship, was anointed a regular starter for the Mets last month. The right-hander, though, has been a regular flop ever since. 
 In his latest pratfall, Whitehurst tonight was singed for five runs over the first three innings in an 8-3 loss to the Astros, a defeat that is certain to endanger his status as a starter of the future.
"I couldn't care what happens, and you can print that," Whitehurst told reporters after the game.
The dismantling of Whitehurst, marking the sixth straight start in which he has failed to last more than five innings, left his record at 0-6 since July 15, the date on which the Mets traded Ron Darling and thereby issued what at the moment was their complete endorsement of Whitehurst as a critical component of their team.
"He has not done what we expected him to," Manager Bud Harrelson had said of Whitehurst before the game. "I expected more quality starts."
The only quality Whitehurst has demonstrated has been the unfortunate one of consistency. He's been inadequate almost every time out. Tonight, the first man he faced singled, as did the second, and the most recent rampage against Whitehurst's fastball was on.
The Astros scored two runs in the first, another two in the second when they sent seven men to the plate against Whitehurst, and a single run in the third. Pete Schourek came on to start the fifth in place of Whitehurst and was cuffed for three runs in one inning.
"I thought he deserved better," Harrelson said. Asked if he was then satisfied with Whitehurst's work, Harrelson bluntly said, "No."
Whitehurst, who started tonight for the injured Dwight Gooden because he had lasted only two innings in his last start, thus had five full innings to digest the latest lamentable tabulation of his numbers. Since the All-Star break, Whitehurst, 5-10 on the season, has worked 312/3 innings and given up 44 hits and 25 runs for an earned run average of 7.11.
"I've got a plan for next time -- I'm going to pitch left-handed," said Whitehurst with a smirk.
Harrelson, asked if Whitehurst's performance could be earning him a return trip to the bullpen, said cryptically before the game that it would be another option considered at the end of the season. Asked directly after the game if Whitehurst would make his next scheduled start this season, Harrelson said, "We'll see." He conceded that his options included a flip-flop of Whitehurst with Schourek or the promotion and regular use of of a minor-leaguer like Anthony Young when the rosters expand in September.
"I'm not going to do anything crazy -- at least not until the numbers say I can," said Harrelson.
Whatever the fallout amounts to, the last six weeks have been a terrible personal deflation for Whitehurst. The 27-year-old, after a patient apprenticeship during which he never complained about his status or the switched services he was constantly asked to provide, thought he had at last entered the stage as a major player with Darling's trade.
"I got named the fifth starter, and the bottom fell out," said Whitehurst. "I don't know what to say. At least I don't know what to say that's printable."
Harrelson's quiet threat about his future as a starter being in trouble could be more bluff than anything else. There is every chance the Mets will not re-sign Frank Viola after this season, a development that will only deplete further an organization no longer all that deep in starting talent.
"A lot will be rethought after the season," said Harrelson.
Tonight, Harrelson tried as best he could not to think about what he'd just seen -- the Mets lose to Darryl Kile, stranding 11 men in the process, the Mets commit two more errors.
"They're all starting to look alike," the manager said of the losses.
 
INSIDE PITCH
 KEVIN McREYNOLDS, surprised at the lack of swelling in his sprained left ankle, said he hoped he'd wind up missing no more than a couple of games. X-Rays of the left-fielder's left ankle late this afternoon were negative., and McReynolds was walking with no great limp in the clubhouse before the game. "It's nowhere near as sore as I thought it would be," he said. . . . DWIGHT GOODEN said he experienced fatigue in his right shoulder while throwing in the outfield Monday, although he said he didn't know how it might affect his scheduled start on Sunday. . . . Manager Bud Harrelson said he could envision Mackey Sasser becoming a bona fide part-time right fielder for the Mets next season. "I'm amazed at how well he's played out there," Harrelson said of Sasser.

HEADLINE: Testing Waters, Wilder Says America's Needs Come First

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Aug. 27

 BODY:
Testing the waters for a campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia came to New Hampshire today with an appeal to "put America first," asserting that the nation could not neglect its own fiscal and economic problems while facing the crises in the Soviet Union and elsewhere in the world.
In a speech to a state treasurers' convention, the text of which was later made available by the Wilder campaign, Mr. Wilder declared, "We cannot focus all our energies on the international arena at the expense of America's finances and economic health." He added, "This neglect can no longer be tolerated." 
 Mr. Wilder, who has sought to portray himself as a voice of fiscal responsibility in his party, outlined a "Put America First" initiative that would cut $50 billion from the annual Federal budget and provide $35 billion in tax breaks for the middle class and $15 billion to state and local governments for new approaches to social problems like drug abuse. He did not provide details on where the $50 billion in cuts would be found.
 
'Put Your Household First'
 The Governor dismissed the notion that his new campaign slogan, which has strong echoes of past isolationist movements in the United States, was an appeal to isolationist sentiments. It simply means, he told a group in Nashua this afternoon, that "you put your household first." He said that as he campaigned on Nashua's streets, "We heard from people today who asked us, 'Why not Americans First?' "
He added: "It's so important to remember that if jobs are going to be found, why not jobs for Americans? If schools are going to be built, why not schools for Americans?"
Mr. Wilder's themes on the first of a two-day swing through New Hampshire reflected the Democrats' attempts to turn the focus to domestic issues, where President Bush is considered vulnerable, even in the midst of the crisis in the Soviet Union. The Governor showed no inclination to tangle with Mr. Bush over foreign policy today.
"I would concede that I have no criticism at all of the President relative to what foreign policy initiatives to undertake," Mr. Wilder told reporters. But the Governor, who is expected to announce next month whether he will seek the Democratic nomination, said he believed that domestic issues were of paramount importance to the American people.

Nebraska Senator Is Considering
 WASHINGTON, Aug. 27 (Reuters) -- Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska "has put himself on a timetable to make a decision in the next several weeks" on whether to seek the 1992 Democratic Presidential nomination, his spokesman said today.
The spokesman, Steven Jarding, said Mr. Kerrey was actively considering a run for the nomination because of recent decisions against running by Senators Al Gore of Tennessee and John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia. In Nebraska last weekend, Mr. Kerrey himself said, "I'm beginning to concentrate on the slimness of the field."
The only declared candidate for the Democratic nomination is former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, although Governor Wilder and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas have both formed exploratory committees.

HEADLINE: After Blackout at A-Plant, a New Wariness

BYLINE: By CRAIG WOLFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SCRIBA, N.Y.

 BODY:
The control room went dark on a Tuesday morning while the dawn sprang gray on Lake Ontario. The nuclear plant sent off a whooping siren that seemed to fall from the sky. It was said to have spooked the cows, but it settled on the house trailers and the front porches and the ballfields like a soft net. The town barely stirred.
By late morning, however, men and women in Scriba, were sharing the news: This had been no routine warning to ignore in your sleep. There had been real chaos up the road at Nine Mile Point in the depths of the Unit 2 reactor, where a group of operators, sitting in a windowless chamber, had been at the mercy of a master panel that suddenly turned blank. 
 In the age of Shoreham and other plants that have been waylaid by community protest, people here have largely clung to a trust in the officials who manage Nine Mile Point. Now, for one of the few times since the 455-foot cooling tower rose on their shore Kong-like 17 years ago, people are angry and openly afraid.
"We used to ignore the alarms," said Carl Carpenter, standing in the driveway of his house three-quarters of a mile from the plant.
"Everyone's got a brother or a sister or a son or a daughter working there, and we were always told there was nothing to worry about. But the room went dark. What's the whole story?"
Officials of the Nuclear Regulatory Agency have since swept in to declare the incident on Aug. 13 -- a loss of power caused by a surge in an electrical transformer -- one of the most serious at an American nuclear plant. Yesterday the agency said that dead batteries in backup power sources were the underlying problem. But even the plant engineers, while issuing assurances that no radioactivity escaped into the atmosphere, have acknowledged that there were several moments when they were not sure how close the plant was to real danger.
Still, Mr. Carpenter and others said they would not be chased from their homes. Theirs is a curious kind of rationalizing in the face of unknown risk.
"I also look at it this way," Mr. Carpenter said. "If something happens, we live to the south. And, thankfully, the winds blow east."
Many people in Scriba, as well as in Oswego, six miles to the west. now say they have grown wary of the explanations offered by the Niagara Mohawk Corporation, which operates the three reactors at Nine Mile Point. Unit 2, in particular, has prompted the most concern. It has one of the poorest records of any reactor in the country -- in operation only 39.4 percent of the time.
Residents said that during other emergencies the company had played down the urgency, only to come forth later to say that the risk was greater than first believed. Still, many of these people said that the plant provided too many economic benefits to the region to warrant being closed. Operations at the plant have been suspended while the company decides when to restart.
 
'You Have to Be Afraid'
 "When the power goes out like that, you have to be afraid," said Ellen O'Brien, a retired office worker. "But where are you going to go in this world without risk? To New York City? There's too much crime. To another rural area? Chances are there's also a nuclear reactor or some such thing."
The response of the community, nuclear experts said, is typical.
"There are four factors at work: financial desperation, fatalism, geographical bonds and ignorance, " said Karl Grossman, a journalism professor at the State University of New York's College at Old Westbury L.I., who has written two books about the nuclear industry.
Here and in Oswego, the debate typically centers on how to make use of the tax dividends provided by Nine Mile Point. The schools have modern auditoriums, the parks are pristine and functional, and the whole town, once rugged and a bit antiquated, now has an efficient, utopian feel. Until two weeks ago, said Donald Vanouse, an English professor at Oswego State University, hardly anyone got riled up over the reactor, which he called "our monstrous neighbor."
Mr. Carpenter stood with his wife, Pauline, in front of the house they bought 23 years ago on Lycoming Road. Back then, they said, maybe three cars would pass each day. Now there is constant traffic as workers make their way to and from the plant.
 
A New Unease Apparent
 Mr. Carpenter, 71 years old, said that before retiring, he worked three jobs to support 10 children. His only passions have been his family and the 1938 Buick Special he has restored in the garage. He worked decades at a clip without a day off, decades that seemed to have lasted as long as that day's lunch, he said.
"Until now," he said, "I accepted what the plant people said, because I never had time."
Clearly a kind of fog seems to have settled over his house since the problem at the plant.
"When that thing goes," his wife said, "We're going to be fried right here on the porch."
Their daughter, Shirley, 39, said she had long been imagining a catastrophe, but she said, it had never been fashionable to talk about it.
"It will be just like I saw it in a movie on TV," she said. "The sky will turn yellow, and everything else in the town will turn dark. There will be men in white suits, and they'll be looking for bodies and deciding who's living and who's dead."
She did not speak about her vision until after the events of Aug. 13. It was something that had often run through her like a quiet shudder.
"Now I can't get rid of the feeling," she said. "It's with me all the time."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 30, 1991, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about problems with a nuclear reactor in Scriba, N.Y., referred incorrectly to the operation of three nuclear plants there. The New York Power Authority, a state agency, operates the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant. The Niagara Mohawk Corporation operates two reactors at the Nine Mile Point plant.

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
A Mosaic of Motives: The West's Response to Baltic Quest for Independence

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 27

 BODY:
The variety of Western responses to the prospect of Baltic independence reflects a mosaic of self-interest, geopolitical currents and domestic political pressures.
 For the second day in a row, President Bush's cautious moves on the issue stood in sharp contrast to other nations' responses, like Scandinavia's rush last week to establish diplomatic relations with the Baltic republics to the European Community's concerted action today to formally recognize Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia as independent countries. 
There were signs that Washington was feeling pressure on the Baltics as Robert S. Strauss, the new Ambassador to Moscow, briefed Mr. Bush here on his trip to the Soviet Union. Both men both hinted that American action on the Baltics could come on Friday, and Administration officials later said they expected the Soviet Parliament to take some action by then.
 
Clearer for Near Neighbors
 Throughout the last eight days, Mr. Bush's native prudence and his conviction that American actions carry more weight than those of other countries in a volatile situation have dominated Washington's decision-making.
 For the Baltic republics' immediate neighbors, the choice has been clearest, driven by their proximity, by a sense of ideological debt and by years of increasingly close cooperation between the Baltics and themselves.
 But for some of the economic powers of Europe -- Britain, France and Germany -- the equation has been considerably more complex.
 The splintering of the Soviet empire added a potentially troublesome element to a question with which the Continent has been grappling for two years: how to integrate the former members of the Communist bloc into its political and economic structure.
Keenly aware of the financial implications of the sudden appearance of three struggling new nations on the northern flank and eager to maintain unity in their foreign policies, the powers chose to act in concert through the European Community, rather than have any one nation shoulder a disproportionate burden by acting alone.
 Moreover, for some Governments, like Italy's, recognizing the Baltics was a gesture that soothed domestic irritation with their failure to take a stronger stand against the plotters, European officials said.
 In the United States, the prospect of Baltic independence forced Mr. Bush to confront, however reluctantly, basic questions about America's new role as the only remaining nuclear superpower, about Washington's relationship with its old ideological adversary and about the President's personal ties to Soviet leaders.
 Although he risks ceding, even temporarily, the leadership role he has sought over the last year, Mr. Bush has so far chosen the safe approach, allowing Moscow to sort out its own relations with its republics.
 The President and his aides have said they fear that acting "precipitously" might upset the delicate balance that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is trying to strike with the republics and with President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian federated republic.
 Despite the increasing powers of Mr. Yeltsin, the Bush Administration is still driven by a fundamental desire to shore up Mr. Gorbachev. American officials said today that the President did not want to force Mr. Gorbachev's hand.
 "There is an element that says, 'Let's not put anything more on Gorbachev's plate while he is somehow trying to pull out of this nosedive,' " an official said.
 Beyond that, officials said, are practical considerations. If the United States establishes diplomatic relations with the Baltics before the Soviet Union granted their independence, Mr. Bush fears that other republics would seek the same thing, they said.
 "If we recognize the Baltics, the Ukrainians, the Moldavians and the Georgians will say, 'Do the same for us,' " an official said. "But if the Soviet Parliament votes, then we can say there was a constitutional process and we're simply recognizing that."
 Another official said: "The interesting thing here is that we don't only run the risk of getting out ahead of Gorbachev, but also of getting out ahead of Yeltsin. He's recognized Baltic independence, but hasn't worked out what to do about the Ukraine and the other republics, not to mention the minorities within Russia itself."
 These considerations were at the core of Mr. Bush's talk this week of America's "special responsibilities" as he explained why he was staying his hand at recognizing the Baltics.
 American officials took heart in an interview given by President Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania today to NBC News, in which he seemed unconcerned about Mr. Bush's pace. "We can wait a little more," Mr. Landsbergis said.
 But American officials acknowledge that their maneuvering room is shrinking, as pressure builds from Europe and at home to recognize the Baltics.
 As a result, officials said, the United States was waiting for the Soviet Parliament to grant independence. But the body that can do that, the Congress of People's Deputies, will not meet until next week. The officials stopped short of saying Mr. Bush would act on his own if Soviet lawmakers did not solve his problem for him by Friday as expected.
 There has been some division of opinion in the Administration about how to proceed with the Baltics, officials said, with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney urging swifter recognition, and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, counseling the more reserved approach.
 "A lot of people find it somewhat difficult to understand why there should be such hesitation, now that there isn't nearly the same question of offending Gorbachev or the central Government," an official said.
 European diplomats said that there was sympathy in their capitals for Washington's position, but that most European governments felt they could not wait to move.
 For instance, Germany, which has been pressing hard for the West to establish relations with the three subjugated republics, has fresh memories of its own struggle for unification.
 But the Germans, who are the biggest donors of foreign aid to the Soviet Union as they work to ease the removal of Soviet troops from the eastern part of their country, did not want to act on their own, the diplomats said.
 "There is a strong sense these days that the European Community must have a distinct foreign policy if it is truly to be the unifying force on the Continent, and so everything now is done at the community level," a diplomat said.

HEADLINE: In Flushing Council Contest, a Slice of Asian Politics

SERIES: Neighborhood Politics: Choosing the Council -- An occasional look at the
races for New York's new City Council.

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH

 BODY:
Vito Dottone, a retired mailman, has spent more than 50 of his 71 years in Flushing. When he thinks about downtown these days, it pains him.
 "It looks like hell," he says. "It's really a disaster." There is too much traffic, filth and chaos. More and more, he says, his neighborhood is turning into an unwieldly Hong Kong. 
Fred Lin Sye would not have it any other way. As he meanders between tables at his Happy Dumpling restaurant just off Main Street, he vehemently defends the vital business district that he and his fellow immigrants have helped create.
 "What's wrong with Hong Kong?" the 62-year-old Mr. Sye says in a voice full of exasperation. "Asian people have put a lot of money in here. Business is good. Now, all of a sudden, people are saying there are too many Asians."
 Between Mr. Dottone and Mr. Sye -- between the old Flushing and the new -- stretch a welter of conflicts that quietly punctuate life in this fast-changing, wildly polyglot community. And as New York prepares to elect an expanded and perhaps more ethnically representative City Council, this interplay of new and old has become the rhythm of the District 20 campaign in Flushing.
 Among the candidates and on the streets, much of the talk is of change and development. Many of the old-time residents -- including Julia Harrison, the two-term Flushing Councilwoman -- say that development simply cannot continue at the same haphazard pace. Many of the newcomers -- including the Chinese candidate for the City Council -- counter that the huge immigrant arrivals have revitalized a dying neighborhood and should proceed unchallenged. In this season of openly ethnic politics, though, there is other talk as well -- about the dangers of polarization, and the hope of electing an Asian to represent Flushing at City Hall.
 But even though the Chinese and Korean immigrants have left such a prominent stamp on the economy -- and the consciousness -- of Flushing, they are still struggling to make an impact on the politics. District 20 was drawn to include a sizable number of Asians, but the Asians of Flushing are finding that they share a common problem with other minority groups in other parts of the city: Demographics alone cannot win an election. Although large in numbers, the Chinese and Koreans remain far less potent in the voting arena.
 Of the new district's 140,000 residents, 44 percent are white and about 31 percent are Asian. Yet whites make up three-quarters of the registered voters and Asians only 6.7 percent -- less than 500 of these registered voters are Chinese. The rest are Koreans and Indians. Both black and Hispanic registered voters constitute less than 10 percent each of the total.
 Although both Asian candidates have concentrated on heavy voter-registration drives, they also admit that the greatest goal of redistricting -- a greater number of minority voters -- may only be achieved a decade from now. Many of the Chinese and Koreans are either not yet citizens or they are wary of authority and politics. A few work in downtown Flushing but live elsewhere. And others are illegal aliens.
 "This is long-range planning," explained Augustine Chen, a community leader and a professor of physics at Saint John's University who helped draw District 20. "In redistricting we first achieve a numerical advantage."
 District 20 was created by cutting out the northern part of the old District 19 -- which was composed mostly of Jewish European immigrants and Irish Americans -- and tacking on to the south the largely Chinese and Korean contiguous populations that live around Kissena Park and the Long Island Expressway.
 
Waves of Immigrants
 Flushing was originally settled by whites of Irish and German descent that built small single-family homes. The black community first centered in what today is downtown Flushing -- their oldest church was founded in the 1830's -- and then filtered out gradually to other areas including three public-housing projects.
 The next large wave of immigrants came after World War II, with the arrival of European Jews. But it was in the 1970's that the area began to change dramatically as a huge influx of Chinese, Koreans, South Americans and Indians moved in. The most recent arrivals are Russian immigrants.
 Since 1980, while black and Hispanic populations have remained relatively stable, about 20 percent of the whites have moved out of the area and many more are talking about moving out because they claim that the quality of life has seriously deteriorated. In the residential areas outside of the din of downtown, many of the older white couples that have lived all their lives here say they refuse to shop in the downtown area because of the traffic and noise and now commute to Long Island instead.
 
Building Political Awareness
 Like other voters, they also worry about issues that are trumpeted by all the candidates. Property owners want lower taxes. There are traffic and sanitation problems, burglaries, robberies, larcenies and even prostitution. Chinese gangs have moved in from Chinatown and extort and steal from restaurants.
 On the surface, the District 20 race is calm. The favorite is Ms. Harrison, whose consituency among her white voter base stands virtually unaffected. She says she has raised about $30,000 mostly in donations of less than $3,000 a piece. In both of her previous council races she has won with at least 70 percent of the vote.
 But one of her Democratic opponents, Pauline Chu, 46 years old, seems to be accomplishing small miracles at least as far as building a political awareness among the Chinese immigrants in Flushing. Vice president of Community School Board 25, she says she has raised about $62,000 so far and by pounding the streets has registered more than 3,000 voters.
 She is deeply involved in community activities and is also backed by the Majority Coalition for a New New York. Her greatest emphasis is on improving the quality of education in public schools. She also says that she will act as a link between the Asian community -- which she defined as insular and shy of authority by nature -- and the rest of the district.
 Robert Gordon, the third Democrat, is the mystery man. He has no known campaign office, his phone number is unlisted and he did not submit any personal information for the Campaign Finance Board's voting guide. But in an interview with The Bayside Times, Mr. Gordon, 58, said he was a retired Housing Authority manager who now worked as an independent business and education consultant. He told the paper that his concerns were education and racial harmony.
 The winner of the Sept. 12 Democratic primary will face the lone Republican, Chun Soo Pyun, 54, a former president of the Korean Businessmen's Association and owner and principal of a vocational school. He considers himself the sacrificial lamb in the race. He is running unchallenged on the Republican ticket because he says he does not want to split the Asian vote in the primary. He believes Ms. Harrison will win the primary and then he hopes to inherit all of Ms. Chu's constituency in the election.
 Outwardly everyone says they want racial harmony but residents say they worry about the Asian candidates representing only their own communities. The race has brought to the surface nagging complaints and community friction.
 One repeated complaint is over the scores of churches, mosques and temples, and other community buildings that have taken over private homes and that residents say have destroyed the character of the neighborhood by bringing crowds of cars and people onto once quiet streets. Many black and Hispanic residents assert that they are automatically considered criminals in certain Chinese and Korean stores -- either barred from entering or followed closely when they go shopping.
 "As long as nobody is going to lean towards -- let's call it 'their people' -- then I don't care whether they are white, black, pink or purple," said Bonnie Burkhardt, who grew up in Flushing, is the owner of Callaghan's Pub and worries that prejudice might govern the elections.
 But Mr. Sye, a registered Republican, says he is voting Democratic this year because he wants to vote Chinese.
"In this area, I'd like a Chinese elected because Chinese know what minorities need," he said. "We should have a Chinese leader. Everyone here is so excited."

HEADLINE: Hard Road for Software Merger

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

 BODY:
Almost every month brings news of a new computer industry match-up: A.T.& T. and NCR, Computer Associates and On-Line Software, Borland International and Ashton-Tate. As profit margins shrivel and the costs of developing new products multiply, merger momentum is bound to continue.
But the record of other high-technology deals, like the one that formed Dun & Bradstreet Software Holdings Inc. in 1989, might give these proud new partners pause. 
 The merger of Management Science America Inc. and McCormack & Dodge was hardly made in heaven. The two companies had been such bitter rivals in the mainframe software business that their animosity was legend. The McCormack & Dodge chairman, Frank H. Dodge, had a goofy red-cheeked mask of his M.S.A. counterpart, John P. Imlay Jr., which he wore at sales meetings while the sales representatives screamed "kill, kill, kill."
 
Cutthroat Tactics
 Several times, M.S.A. sales representatives tracked down prospective customers on their way to meetings with M.& D. sales representatives, took them out for meals and then drove them around for hours professing to be lost.
"We simply hated each other's guts," said Dean F. Redfern, a former M.& D. executive.
But on Nov. 20, 1989, the unthinkable happened: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, M.& D.'s parent, acquired M.S.A. for $390 million and merged the two software makers into a single entity. When Mr. Imlay went before his employees at the company's Atlanta headquarters to tell them, a voice called from the audience, "Who do we hate now?"
Now, as Dun & Bradstreet Software, the merged companies have to aim at different rivals while enduring internal upheavals. Some employees have been laid off while others received lucrative payments, one of the principals angrily departed, and many customers are wondering how well the new company will maintain and update their installed software.
The stakes are high. Dun & Bradstreet is now the fifth-largest software maker in the world, pursuing a chunk of what the International Date Corporation of Framingham, Mass., expects to be a $250 billion industry by 1994.
To Robert E. Weissman, president and chief operating officer of the Dun & Bradstreet parent company, the merger is already a success. "This one has not been seamless, but it's better than 99.7 percent of all the deals we've made," he said. Dun & Bradstreet Software is now a $500 million giant, profitable in its first year, according to the company.
 
Few Past Successes
 But history offers Dun & Bradstreet Software scant encouragement. In the early 1970's, the Xerox Corporation bought a hot computer company called Scientific Data Systems for more than $1 billion and effectively killed it. More recent match-ups, like the one between Sperry and Burroughs to form Unisys, or the International Business Machines Corporation's acquisition of Rolm, a leading telecommunications company, have produced dismal results.
Computer Associates International, of Garden City, L.I., a Dun & Bradstreet Software competitor, has gobbled up several software companies, leaving it with such an assortment of successes and failures that earnings are flat and the company's reputation on Wall Street has soured.
"The old adage is that if you take two companies, each playing with half a deck, and put them together, you don't get a full deck, you get a quarter deck," said Harvey L. Poppel, a partner in Broadview Associates, a merger consulting firm in Fort Lee, N.J.
The difficulty of high-technology mergers stems from the rapid changes in technology itself. Merging companies tend to be competitors who often have to spend more time combining their proprietary product lines than planning further innovations.
Software companies, especially, have strong, distinctive cultures, with dominant leaders who have unique styles, said George Colony, president of Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "People within the company tend to grab onto that style, and when you try to slam that together with the culture of another software maker, it generally flops," he said.
Analysts say it did make sense for M.S.A. and M.& D. to merge. Their combined size could make it easier to develop new products for networks of desktop computers as their traditional market, before mainframe computer software stagnates. "The merger was absolutely a smart move," said Stephen McClellan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
But few who study the industry are ready to declare the merger a long-term success. "The process is long and tedious," said Clare Gillan, an analyst with International Data. "It's still too soon to call it a success."
The company now has to support two full product lines for its combined 13,000 customers, while trying to create an entirely new and complex software line, and customers are anxious. "It's like waking up in the morning and finding someone else in bed with you," said Scott Davey, an accounts payable manager at Van Waters & Rogers Inc., a chemicals distributor in Bellevue, Wash., that is a longtime M.& D. customer.
The new corporate partners have often found that their styles clashed. M.S.A. was known as an aggressive marketing and sales organization, while M.& D. had a reputation for better technology and a family-like atmosphere for employees.
Resentment lingers among the 3,500 employees in the Atlanta headquarters of the combined company and in Framingham, Mass., where the former M.& D. contingent remains. "It feels like the Civil War, the North against the South," said one Framingham employee.
Lawrence Catchpole, an M.S.A. veteran and the new company's director of research, said many Atlanta employees were having trouble adjusting to new ownership.
"The M.& D. side knew what it was like to be owned, but we had never been owned before," he said. "It feels a little like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Just as those characters were pursued by lawmen they didn't know, the M.S.A. people are prone to ask about the strangers in their midst, "Who are these D.& B. guys anyway?"
Or, as Mr. Redfern, the 12-year M.& D. veteran who became executive vice president and general manager in the Framingham office after the merger, put it, "In a merger like this, there are winners and losers."
 
Survivors and the Vanquished
 Among the winners is the 54-year-old Mr. Imlay, the heavy-jowled Southerner whose homespun humor accompanies a sharp business sense and the motivational skills of Elmer Gantry. Mr. Imlay took over M.S.A. in 1970 and built it into a $265 million business. On the day he sold to Dun & Bradstreet for $18.50 a share, Mr. Imlay pocketed $53 million and became chairman of the new company.
His first task was to stroll through the executive offices on the 13th floor in Atlanta handing out million-dollar-plus checks to 15 members of his management team.
Among the losers is Mr. Dodge, the co-founder of M.& D., who had sold his company to D.& B. in 1983 but remained in charge. Mr. Weissman, president of the Dun & Bradstreet parent company, asked Mr. Dodge to stay on as vice chairman of the software company, but Mr. Dodge did not want to be second in command. Three months after the deal was concluded, he left.
He contends that he was locked out of his own building and dismissed. He filed a suit seeking to be released from his contractual pledge against competing with his former employer. D.& B. fired back, saying Mr. Dodge quit "gracelessly." Mr. Dodge's suit was thrown out of court.
Strangely enough, it was Mr. Dodge who had proposed a merger to Mr. Imlay during a round of golf in 1988, but Mr. Imlay refused. Now, Mr. Dodge has announced plans for a new software company.
 
Taking It Personally
 Mr. Dodge's abrupt departure shocked M.& D. employees who regarded him as a father. So much for the family-like atmosphere at M.& D., they told each other. Mr. Redfern, who was close to Mr. Dodge, understood the apprehensions. Employees feel like "a personal crime has been committed and never adjudicated," Mr. Redfern said.
Mr. Imlay moved quickly to consolidate the two companies. His first priority was to send a united sales force into the field. "The secret to a successful merger is realizing that the revenue is created from the sales force," Mr. Redfern said. "You've got to get the sales force moving quickly."
At the first combined sales meeting, Mr. Imlay compared the merger to the fall of the Berlin wall. He built to a rousing conclusion, dancing to rock music and yelling, "How would you like to compete with us?"
 
Higher Compensation
 What really motivated the sales force was a more generous compensation package, giving everyone the high commissions usually reserved for those who had already reached their quotas. So despite 200 layoffs in the first 120 days, the sales force stormed out and by November had fulfilled Dun & Bradstreet Software's targets for the fiscal year ending that month: nearly $500 million in revenues with profits in excess of $50 million.
But the layoffs continued, with the company blaming a poor economy, not the merger, for the most recent round in March. Executives find themselves having to deny rumors of further cuts. In all, 600 people have lost their jobs.
Employees hoping for a return to the good old days are waiting in vain, said Mr. Redfern, who has since left the company. "There are some employees who got on the bus and some who never got on and never will," he said. "It's just not the company it once was."
 
Good Morale From Success
 Some of the executives still with the company deride such nostalgia. John Landry, the merged company's chief technologist and the software wizard who created M.& D.'s most profitable products in the 1970's, left the company in 1985 but was persuaded to return by Mr. Imlay last winter. He said that neither M.& D. nor M.S.A. turned out a "significant new product in five years," adding, "Good morale is based upon success."
Many in the industry say that success will depend on the company's ability to keep the ambitious promises it has made to customers.
"If D.B.S. can truly deliver the products and technology they are talking about, the merger will be a success," said Mr. Davey, the long-time customer. "If not, it's a big waste of time."

HEADLINE: History Repeats, Europe Forgets

BYLINE: By Josef Joffe; Josef Joffe is foreign editor and columnist of Suddeutsche Zeitung.

DATELINE: MUNICH

 BODY:
Where was Europe?
A few hours into the Moscow putsch, as Europe's chanceries were preparing to cave in to the amateur plotters, George Bush took the lead by hoisting the "coups fail" banner. Last August it was the United States that drew a line in the sand, dragging a bunch of reluctant allies all the way to victory against Saddam Hussein. 
 How about closer to the European home -- say Yugoslavia, where the Serbs are no longer skirmishing but conducting a real war against the Croats, complete with tanks and aircraft? Well, the Europeans are still pondering the issue. Germany is threatening to recognize Slovenia or Croatia, but so much fecklessness does not play in France or Britain, which fear a Teutonic power play in the Balkans.
Just a year ago, Europe was merrily surfing along yet another wave of the future. Soviet power was retracting, U.S. power was turning obsolete. Indeed, the might of nations was becoming thoroughly "civilianized," with economic clout muscling aside tanks and thermonuclear weapons. Poised for a more perfect common market as of 1993, the European Community was eyeing imminent superpower status. And just two months ago, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher was presiding over an inaugural meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe that would act as a latter-day "Concert of Europe" and bring peace to the restless natives on the periphery.
Alas, Clio -- the goddess of history -- is a nasty lady. Amid celebrations of transcendence she has reminded us that history, seemingly banished, has a habit of sneaking in through the back door. Just look at Europe, where three forgotten dramas are being enacted again.
In the East, an empire is exploding once more, and though the republican revolution is entirely wholesome, it is already overshadowed by the classic codas of such breakups: nationality and border strife. Consult the encyclopedia on such friendly tribes as the Gagauz and Moldavians, the Armenians and the Azerbaijanis. Also familiarize yourself with the traditional resource flows of the Soviet Union and ponder what the southern republics will do when Russia, already eyeing pieces of Kazakhstan and the Ukraine, cuts off their water supplies.
In the Southeast, recall Sarajevo 1914. Serbian imperialism gave us World War I, and the '91 model is already well positioned to carve out a Greater Serbia from the remains of Yugoslavia. Neo-Communism plus expansionism does not equal peace. But Europe has nothing more to offer than yet another team of mediators, complete with battalion of "observers" armed to the teeth with notepads and binoculars.
In the rest of Europe, the ghosts of yesteryear are reappearing all over again -- albeit not clad in jackboots. Call it power politics on cats' feet. Norwegians and Danes rushed their diplomats into the Baltic republics to make sure that the Germans did not get there first. The French and the British, already wary of a "Greater Central European Co-Prosperity Sphere" centered on Berlin, cannot bring themselves to make common cause with Germany in the Balkans because they suspect the making of a "Teutonic bloc."
But, most important, what about post-putsch Russia? The Germans have shelled out $34 billion since 1989 to keep Mikhail Gorbachev afloat. Much of it was strictly protection money, disbursed to speed the withdrawal of some 400,000 Soviet troops from eastern Germany. That makes for a powerful separate interest toward Russia-U.S.S.R. that France, Britain and Italy naturally do not share with the same urgency.
The moral of this tale is the opposite of common foreign policy, let alone of a European superpower in the making. While the demise of the cold war has liberated ancient blood feuds in the East, it has -- predictably -- loosened the political bonds forged in the West. Western Europe '91 resembles a bunch of teen-agers suddenly forced to fend for themselves.
In the old days, they could collectively rub up against the powerful father figure that was the United States, confident of Washington's forbearance and protection. And there was always the Soviet Union of Leonid Brezhnev and successors, offering the opportunity for cautious side deals that delivered leverage against the United States.
But today? There is power without real purpose, aspiration without real leadership. Nor will Europe rise to the challenge. In the crunch, the French will always fall back to their favorite policy of "splendid aggravation." The British will never quite leave their favorite place on the fence. The Germans will try to please everybody while quietly cultivating their Central European garden. And all of them will be quick to check one another's ambitions rather than coalesce in a common policy. Which leaves the United States in the not-so-enviable position of No. 1 in the world.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Journal;
Is Big Business Getting Too Cozy With the Mob?

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 28

 BODY:
The hottest underground videotape in Japan right now is a grainy two-hour montage of a secret accession ceremony of a major organized-crime gang. Many major businesses are said to be nervously checking the tape for familiar faces.
The reason for their concern is that in the last five years, organized crime, fattened by huge profits in Japan's fast-growing economy, has managed to infiltrate legitimate business to a degree never before imagined in a society that likes to think of itself as basically law-abiding. 
 Willingly or not, some of Japan's most prestigious companies have become involved in questionable deals with even more questionable individuals and groups, and disclosures about these contacts have been at the core of a series of financial scandals rocking Japan for months.
In a recent speech, Ryochi Suzuki, director general of the National Police Agency, called on police chiefs to get tough. Mobsters, he said, "are having a major impact on the country's economic system" by moving into mainstream businesses.
 
$10 Billion For Gangsters
 The police say the income of organized crime was nearly $10 billion last year, as much as a major industrial company, but they acknowledge that this is only an estimate and that the total could be two or three times higher. About a fifth of the gangs' total revenue these days is said to come from legitimate business.
According to the police, there are 88,600 members of organized crime in Japan, belonging to 3,300 groups dominated by three large syndicates. Their primary sources of income are said to be gambling, drugs, prostitution, labor rackets and extortion, known in police parlance as "intervention in civil affairs."
But skyrocketing real estate and stock market prices in the last five years have attracted the gangsters, known as yakuza. Indeed, real estate has long been known to be infiltrated by mobsters who assemble large pieces of land by employing thugs to remove tenants or force property owners to sell.
 
Biggest Brokers Implicated
 "To be honest, we never realized until recently how much money these groups have at hand," said Hiroshi Ishizuki, director of the financial crimes unit at the Police Agency. "I also don't think we are getting full cooperation from companies or individuals with our investigations."
Among the recent embarrassments have been allegations that Nomura Securities, the biggest brokerage firm in the world, helped a reputed organized crime leader, Susumi Ishii, manipulate share prices of the Tokyu Corporation, a railroad and real estate conglomerate. An official investigation is under way.
At least two other major companies have admitted making loans to Mr. Ishii, who has declined to comment on all charges. The net has even gone to the United States, where it appears that mobsters have been no less eager than mainstream businesses to find good investments and hire influential lobbyists.
In another case, an old-line textile company was alarmed that its shares were being accumulated by a mob-related investment group, and it eventually repurchased the shares, apparently at a loss. This suggested that mobsters are engaging in a form of blackmail known as "greenmail."
In addition, some purchasers of paintings at auctions in the United States and Europe are known to be organized crime figures. It thus appears that trafficking in paintings, often portrayed in the overseas press as an amusing eccentricity of the Japanese, is actually sometimes carried out by professional criminals to launder money, make illicit payments or evade taxes.
 
'Difficult to Say No'
 Legitimate businesses maintain that criminal infiltration is not their fault. "The stock market is accessible to anybody," said Yasuhiro Mizuuchi, an executive vice president of Nomura. "It's extremely difficult to say no to clients who have not violated the law just because of their backgrounds."
Organized crime may be pervasive around the world, but in Japan it has one unique feature: its openness. Criminal syndicates operate storefront offices with their own signs, especially in poor areas of big cities where gambling, drugs and prostitution flourish. Their spokesmen sometimes speak freely of their engaging in illegal activities.
In a recent interview, for instance, Yukio Yamanouchi, a lawyer for the syndicate known as Yamaguchi-gumi, maintained that police estimates of mob income were not entirely accurate. "The estimate of income from drugs is a little exaggerated," he said.
Mr. Yamanouchi, a boyish looking man with metal-frame glasses, portrayed organized crime as providing a service that society demands -- like sex, drugs or gambling -- and said the police generally "let them behave freely to a certain extent" unless there is violence.
 
'Modest and Timid Men'
 "You cannot deny that there is a strong demand for these activities," he said. "Many yakuza members are actually modest and timid men whose girlfriends earn most of the money from prostitution. The murder rate among members of organized crime is quite low."
Another factor in the strength of the yakuza is that the number of lawyers is strictly limited in Japan, to maintain a ratio with the number of judges and prosecutors. Thus many people with grievances, like victims of traffic accidents, hire yakuza to obtain damage payments, and they get a percentage of the payment.
Mr. Yamanouchi said he agreed with the sardonic observation that the mob in Japan thus fills a function played by lawyers in other societies. In any case, as a lawyer, Mr. Yamanouchi said, he does not usually see himself as a defender of innocent people. He explained that his own main tactic in court when a client is arrested is to advise him to plead guilty.
 
'Few Innocent Defendants'
 "There are very few cases of innocent defendants in Japan," he said.
Like other experts, Mr. Yamanouchi agreed that mobsters were moving into legitimate businesses, and he was doubtful that the police could make any headway. The Government has enacted laws, for instance, to confiscate assets and define activities so as to make it easier to arrest members of the groups.
But Mr. Yamanouchi said the new laws would only serve to drive the mob underground.
"We have to remember that the Japanese yakuza are very open about their activities," he said, suggesting that open organized crime helps to insure a low crime rate generally. "Japanese public security is very high. The crimes to be tolerated are a basic choice of the Japanese people."

HEADLINE: U.N. Chief Seeks to Expand Africa Aid and to Cancel Deb

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 28

 BODY:
Five years after the United Nations carried out a wide-ranging plan to improve African economies, Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar says Africa is worse off than ever and has proposed extending and expanding the program.
Citing the United States' cancellation of $7 billion of Egypt's debt and forgiveness of much of the Polish debt, Mr. Perez de Cuellar has proposed that donor nations also forgive or help pay off virtually all of Africa's combined $270 billion in debt. 
 "Clearly, additional and more energetic efforts are necessary to revitalize growth and development in Africa," the Secretary General said in a report released today.
He attributed the failure of the United Nations Program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development to low commodity prices, the reluctance by some African governments to adhere to the plan and donor fatigue.
"Economic and social conditions actually worsened over the five years of the period," Mr. Perez de Cuellar continued. "This occurred despite the many far-reaching actions and reforms undertaken by African countries, including notable progress toward democratization."
Although results varied among countries, Africa on the whole during the last five years saw its per-capita gross domestic product fall an average of seven-tenths of 1 percent, the report said.
"Social conditions worsened considerably, with deterioration in the areas of education, health, nutrition, employment and incomes, with especially serious effects on children, youth and women," Mr. Perez de Cuellar said.
The General Assembly adopted the original aid plan in June 1986. African nations estimated that it would cost $128 billion and pledged to provide $82.5 billion of it.
But weak prices on world commodity markets hampered the program from the outset. And promised increases in international aid, measaured against inflation, never materialized.
Also, many African governments were reluctant to accept Western-imposed austerity provisions, like paring subsidies and increasing taxes on already poor people.
Mr. Perez de Cuellar, in trying to persuade African governments and aid providers to make commitments, warned that a failure to do so would wipe out meager gains and could cause political and social turmoil that would destroy recent democratization gains.
"These successes have been achieved at a high social and political cost," he said, "and African countries will not be able to sustain them unless additional resources are made available to insure that significant gains soon become apparent to the African people. "
The Secretary General said the new economic blueprint must be explicit, with specific sets of action to be carried out by Africans. To meet one objective -- doubling per-capita income to about $700 by the year 2015 -- Mr. Perez de Cuellar said, Africans must strive for 6 percent annual growth.
He proposed that donors cancel all debts owed to them by African countries and that the wealthier nations help pay off some African private and commercial debt.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Stages Broad Retreat On Report of Lower G.N.P.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined on world currency markets yesterday after the Government reported that the United States economy had unexpectedly contracted in the second quarter.
Gold prices eased in domestic markets after settling mixed overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $353.90 an ounce, off 50 cents from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank of New York said gold slipped 10 cents an ounce, to a late bid of $354.25. 
 The Commerce Department reported yesterday morning that the economy had contracted at an annual rate of a tenth of a percent in the April-June quarter, a sharp contrast to an initial estimate of a rise of four-tenths of a percent in the period.
 
Concerns About Lower Rates
 The report on the gross national product raised questions of whether the nation had emerged from the recession and heightened the prospect that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates to stimulate growth. Lower American interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less attractive to investors.
"The G.N.P. report was below expectations," said Randolph Donney, the research director at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. That created a technical selloff that will probably extend into the next session, he said.
Mr. Donney said that in order to stem the selling, fresh economic statistics were needed to back up last week's favorable report on orders for durable goods.
Trading volume on the foreign exchange markets was relatively light. "That's partly because people are reluctant to extend positions at the end of the month and ahead of a holiday weekend, and because a lot of people got burned after last week's violent swings" in response to the failed Soviet coup, said Marc Chandler, an analyst at the advisory firm IDEA.
 
Japanese Yen Rises
 In Tokyo, before the G.N.P. report was released, the dollar finished at 137.13 yen, up 0.08 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, it was quoted at 136.60 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 136.55 yen, down from 137.00 yen on Tuesday.
In London, the pound rose to $1.6900, from $1.6795 late Tuesday. In New York, it cost $1.6900 to buy a pound, up from $1.6800 on Tuesday.
Against the German currency, the dollar fell in New York to 1.7395 marks, from 1.7505 late Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's late rates, included: 1.5171 Swiss francs, down from 1.5235; 5.9025 French francs, down from 5.9435; 1,297.50 Italian lire, down from 1,306.00, and 1.1408 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1415.

HEADLINE: The Bitter Victims of B.C.C.I.'s Fall

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRADFORD, England

 BODY:
The people accused of engineering the huge fraud that brought down the Bank of Credit and Commerce International reside in various states of luxury, ranging from a villa in Karachi, Pakistan, to a hotel suite in Abu Dhabi to a yacht in the south of France.
But the victims are in places like Bradford, an old industrial city in northern England where Mohammed Aslam Choudary sadly surveys his idle workshop. It used to employ as many as 60 people stitching up bed sheets, pillowcases and quilts, more than 10,000 sets a week. Now the shop floor is deserted except for a few barren tables, unattended sewing machines and a dejected Mr. Choudary, one of B.C.C.I.'s former customers. 
 "The innocent people -- depositors and small businesses -- did not have anything to do with the fraud, yet we are the ones getting hurt," said Mr. Choudary, a 40-year-old Pakistani immigrant. "It does not seem fair."
His company, Greatmade Ltd., got its trade financing from B.C.C.I. to pay for the cloth it imported from Pakistan. It also had about $14,000 deposited at the local branch. The bedding producer cannot obtain trade financing at another bank until British regulators sort through B.C.C.I.'s customer accounts, a laborious process likely to take months and threaten the survival of Greatmade, which is losing orders and an estimated $20,000 a month.
The stories of B.C.C.I.'s former customers differ in certain details, but the theme is remarkably similar: Unlike in the United States, where a generous deposit-insurance program has socialized the financial burden, in most other countries, bank failures mean personal hardship.
Britain's deposit insurance, for example, covers only 75 percent of the losses on an account, up to a maximum of just 15,000, or $25,500. In the United States, accounts up to $100,000 are insured, and sometimes even larger amounts are covered.
B.C.C.I. had more than 40,000 depositors in this country, and it is the Asian business community, whose members were among the bank's biggest depositors, that has felt most of the pain. C. B. Patel, the editor of Asian Business magazine, estimates that 20,000 Asian businesses may be in danger because of the seizure of B.C.C.I in July.
Having come to Britain in the postwar years, Asians now run thousands of newsstands, restaurants, small shops, and fabric and garment factories throughout the country. Many of these entrepreneurs, mainly Indian and Pakistani immigrants, have been hurt directly because they had accounts at the bank. Yet even those businesses that did not bank at B.C.C.I. are often suffering because so many of their customers did.
Founded by a Pakistani entrepreneur, B.C.C.I. was the bank of choice for members of the Asian community, who were outsiders, often shunned by traditional British banks. But at B.C.C.I. they found a welcome, people who looked like they did, spoke their language and understood their problems. To walk into a B.C.C.I. branch was to enter a comfortable world of shared cultural assumptions and business norms.
For lending when others would not, B.C.C.I. charged higher interest rates on commercial loans than did other banks. And in keeping with its aggressive approach to growth, B.C.C.I. offered higher interest rates on deposits. "But for most Asians, the real reason for going to B.C.C.I. was the social links," Mr. Patel said.
 
Higher Number of Asians
 Nowhere would that be more true than in Bradford, a city of roughly 460,000 people where the economy is in transition from the textile industry to services, tourism and high technology. Bradford has one of the highest concentrations of Asians of any city in Britain, with 45,000 Muslims, 9,000 Hindus and 9,000 Sikhs. The Bradford telephone book, for instance, has 104 listings under the name Patel, 227 Singhs and 221 Alis. And those figures understate the presence of Asians, since many, seeking privacy and fearing racial taunts, have unlisted numbers.
Many of the Asian immigrants arrived in the late 1950's and early 1960's to work the night shifts in the textile mills on the new machinery that had been installed in a belated and eventually futile effort to respond to foreign competition. But the immigrants stayed after the mills closed, setting up small businesses while their children attended universities and went into the professions.
In Bradford, the victims of the B.C.C.I. scandal are often bitter about the way Western government officials shut down the bank, leaving depositors, borrowers and former B.C.C.I. employees in the lurch. And it is a bitterness echoed among B.C.C.I.'s customers worldwide, who tend to be in developing countries or immigrants from the third world.
"The feelings in the Asian community are very strong that the Government should have kept the bank alive and their savings intact," said Aurangzeb Iqbal, a Bradford lawyer representing some 600 depositors with $26 million in B.C.C.I. "In other financial scandals in Britain, like the Guinness affair, the criminals were brought to book but the company was not shut down."
A garment maker, Wetherby Fashions Ltd., in the neighboring city of Leeds, had its $2.6 million pension fund for its 27 employees deposited at B.C.C.I. A friend of the owning family was an official at B.C.C.I. and, at the start of the year, he convinced Wetherby to move its pension fund account from National Westminster to B.C.C.I., where the interest rate was half a percentage point higher.
Before they put the money in B.C.C.I., explained Ajmair Bhullar, Wetherby's managing director, his family was concerned about the money-laundering conviction against B.C.C.I. in Florida. "But when the American branches closed down, it didn't seem to have any effect here," he said.
But today, the company's $2.6 million pension fund, accummulated over 20 years, looks to be in grave danger because of the 15,000 limit on deposit insurance. Unless the bank's principal shareholder, Sheik Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan of Abu Dhabi, can be persuaded to finance a multibillion-dollar bailout, large deposits like Wetherby's pension fund will be lost.
Mr. Bhullar believes that the British banking authorities and B.C.C.I.'s auditors performed poorly. "They should have warned people," he said. "The Bank of England and auditors knew, and we didn't."
 
Bleak Outlook for Employees
 For the bank's 1,200 employees in Britain, the outlook is bleak. And their job prospects have not been helped by the comments of the British authorities. Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, told Parliament in July while testifying on why B.C.C.I. had to be seized that "the culture of the bank is criminal." Still, he also said that he thought the British operations of B.C.C.I. were solvent, despite the huge losses the bank suffered worldwide. And only in the United States has anyone been formally charged with fraud.
Yet the bank's employees feel they have all been tainted by the bank governor's statement that B.C.C.I. was a "criminal" bank.
"I'll have a very difficult time getting a job in banking in this country," said Ijaz Choudary, the former B.C.C.I. branch manager in Bradford. "And I don't think this whole affair would have been handled this way if B.C.C.I. were a white, Western bank instead of a Muslim bank from the third world."

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Yields Up on Tax-Exempt Money Funds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed for the week ended yesterday, with yields of tax-exempt funds rising as many usual buyers moved to longer maturities with higher yields.
The seven-day compounded average yield for tax-exempt funds rose 2 basis points, to 4.12 percent, with the simple yield up 1 basis point, to 4.03 percent. During the same period the 30-day compounded yield rose 3 basis points, to 4.10 percent, as the simple yield was up similarly, to 4.02 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 Donoghue's said the average number of days to maturity of securities held in portfolios fell one day, to 57.
Walter S. Frank, Donoghue's chief economist, said there is at least an even chance that the Federal Reserve will ease short-term interest rates again, as the economic numbers continue to indicate that the recovery is struggling.
"Last week's durable-goods figures put a temporary halt to speculation of another easing by the Fed," he said. "And right now the market is focusing on the employment number which is due out Sept 6 for a clue to Fed intentions."
Analysts said total assets of tax-exempt funds for the week were down by $253 million, to $87.7 billion.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day compounded yield is 5.72 percent, while the equivalent in the 31 percent tax bracket is 5.97 percent.
Of the funds monitored by IBC/ Donoghue's with assets larger than $100 million, the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, which buys some securities that for some investors is subject to the Federal alternative minimum tax, continued as the best performer. The fund, which is distributed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management Inc. of Milwukee, had a return of 5.02 percent, down 7 basis points from the previous week.
Assets of taxable funds fell by $3.7 billion, to $456.5 billion. The drop was the reverse of last week's flight to safety from the stock market and international markets.
"The average number of days to maturity of securities held in portfolios is up to historical highs, with fund managers reaching higher along the steep yield curve for better returns," Mr. Frank said.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield fell by 5 basis points, to 5.45 percent, while the simple yield fell 4 basis points, to 5.31 percent. The 30-day compounded yield was down 5 basis points, to 5.57 percent and the simple yield was down 4 basis points, to 5.38 percent.
The taxable fund with the best return was Riverside Capital Money Market fund, distributed by the Winsbury Company of Columbus, Ohio. The return was 6.39 percent.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, which compete with money market funds, were down 2 basis points to 5.14 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index. The yield spead between bank money market accounts and money market funds narrowed to 31 basis points this week, compared with 34 basis point only a week ago.

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
U.S. Swords Into Plowshares for Soviets?

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28

 BODY:
Congress began grappling with the murky consequences of Soviet upheaval today as Representative Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, urged taking $1 billion from the military budget to send food and medicine to the Soviet Union this winter.
He contended that providing stability in the Soviet Union was "defense by different means, but defense nevertheless." But he was quickly challenged both on the wisdom of large-scale aid and the best source of it. 
 The emerging debate, conducted today not in committee meetings or the floor of the House or Senate but in news conferences, press releases and telephone interviews, is sure to grow and may gain focus when Congress returns to Washington the week after next.
But then it is likely to be mixed with the message the Democrats made insistently last month, that more money needs to be spent on domestic needs. Senator Patrick V. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who heads the Appropriations Committee on foreign aid, said today, "People are more interested in what domestic aid we get than in what foreign aid we give."
 
Skepticism on Aid
 He said that short of actual famine, large-scale aid to the Soviet Union would be a mistake without substantial reforms. Last year, he said, the Soviet Union let "22 million metric tons rot in the fields." The differences of opinion were not limited to Democrats. Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader, said the uncertainties after the failed coup in Moscow showed "for the time being, it is imperative that we keep our eyes wide open and our guard up."
But Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, said the United States should now pledge that "people will not go hungry this winter in the Soviet Union." He said the Pentagon budget was the logical source of funds because "the destruction of Communist control in the Soviet Union obviously reduces the long-term military requirements of the United States."
 
$1 Billion in 'Seed Money'
 With little or no guidance from the Administration, there is little sense in a Congress scattered around the country, and the globe, of how much the Soviet Union or its republics may actually need this winter. But there is a widespread fear of food shortages.
The version of the foreign aid authorization bill passed last month by the Senate, for example, included $20 million in humanitarian aid for the Baltics. No aid was provided for Moscow.
Mr. Aspin said today that his $1 billion number was merely "illustrative," and the proper sum might be $500 million or $1.5 billion. The Wisconsin Democrat also called that $1 billion "seed money" that should lead other Western democracies to join in an emergency aid package.
Overlaying the substance of what range of money might wisely be spent is the looming presence of last year's budget agreement, which sets a ceiling of about $15 billion on all foreign aid and erects so-called "fire walls" to prevent the shifting of money among the categories of defense, domestic spending and foreign aid.
Mr. Aspin's proposal offered a legal way around that firewall, by creating a category of Soviet humanitarian aid within the defense budget. But Leon V. Panetta, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, reacted coolly and said he thought it was a bad idea to evade the laboriously negotiated limits.
Mr. Panetta said he did not "question the need to provide some kind of assistance package." But he said it was "ultimately going to have to be worked out with the White House."
Senator James Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Budget Committee, said that he thought the Aspin proposal was "slightly premature," but added that it would be "difficult to quarrel" with taking $1 billion from a military budget of nearly $300 billion for food and medicine.
Representative William L. Dickinson of Alabama, the senior Republican on Mr. Aspin's committee, said that while he supported "some form of limited humanitarian assistance," it would be a mistake to tap the Pentagon's budget and undo the "fragile" budget agreement. Any program of long-term help, he said, needed bipartisan agreement within Congress and with the Executive Branch and Western nations.
Mr. Aspin made it clear he was not talking about any long-term aid program, which he said should await internal economic reforms. But foreseeing severe problems this winter, he argued that food and medicine would reduce the risk of "chaos in a nation with 30,000 nuclear weapons."
 
Enhancing U.S. Security
 After the arguments made on the Cable News Network and to The Washington Post by the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, Mr. Aspin picked the $291 billion military authorization bill as the sensible source of money. He said taking $1 billion from it to try to avert disorder would reward democratic reform in the Soviet Union and enhance United States security.
Mr. Danforth said that forecasts of shortage and hunger called on "a long tradition in our country to offer food aid," and added, "We better be prepared to do what has to be done." Providing food to seek stability in a power like the Soviet Union, he said, meant that there was now a "double reason" for the United States to help.
He insisted that the budget agreement and its defense spending numbers were now obsolete. "Why should we be locked into a defense strategy that has been overtaken by events?" Mr. Danforth asked. Mr. Leahy said that while he would see that some funds for the Soviet Union were included in the foreign aid appropriation bill, they would be "symbolic" rather than substantial. The United States is already supplying substantial food aid through guarantees of loans to the Soviet Union, he said, even though "their credit worthiness is about on a par with a Texas savings and loan."

HEADLINE: Bubble and Trouble in New York's Venerable Melting Pot

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB

 BODY:
Few people speak unabashedly anymore about the ideal of the melting pot. Years of ethnic and racial battling, varying degrees of progress by various groups toward America's mainstream and the yawning rift between whites and blacks -- all have made the concept an object of derision, amendment or outright dismissal.
Yet frayed as the image may be, a summer of tension in New York indicates that it still holds some mythic sway in a city that used to accept it as a municipal credo. How else to explain why during a period of severe budget cuts, recession and violent crime, an outbreak of racial and ethnic incidents overrode all else and seemed to hold the city in its thrall?
 
A Collective Anxiety
 From a month of racial firebombings and attacks in slowly integrating Canarsie, to the ethnically inflammatory statements of Prof. Leonard Jeffries, to last week's conflagration in Crown Heights, the city seemed to react with particular anxiety to events that seemed to threaten the live-and-let-live milieu that many New Yorkers take pride in and view as crucial. 
 For behind live-and-let-live in this ultimate polyglot city is the absolute necessity of coexisting with one's often very different neighbors. And there is also the hope of something grander. If few still endorse the image of the big pot from which the world's wretched refuse emerge as middle-class, non-hyphenated Americans, there is still Mayor David N. Dinkins's "gorgeous mosaic," in which pieces of different sizes and colors help to form a larger whole more attractive than its components.
Yet behind a summer of friction, violence and murder, are other sobering truths that have emerged with regularity in the past half decade after the attack on three black men by a crowd of white teen-agers in Howard Beach, Queens, the murder of Yusuf K. Hawkins by white teen-agers in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, the Tawana Brawley case, the Central Park jogger attack and trial, and the black boycott of the Korean grocery stores in Flatbush, Brooklyn.
 
Resistance to Change
 Many New Yorkers, mostly entrenched whites, are resistant to trading their insular neighborhoods for a rapidly changing, ever more diverse world. Many New Yorkers, mostly black, are moving further into poverty and away from the fruits of the city's unparalleled urban experience, and at best don't connect with ideals that have yielded them nothing. Many New Yorkers, of every race and ethnic grouping, are far from immune to racism, anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry. And many New Yorkers, particularly blacks, at moments of crisis overtly reject the integrationist goals implicit in the melting pot and similar ideals and find their voices at least in part in the persons of the Rev. Al Sharpton, Alton H. Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon Mason.
 
'Conflict Is Normal'
 In the face of this, say many human-relations experts, the city never committed the resources to dealing with tense neighborhood relations when they erupt.
"Conflict is normal -- we still have not accepted that fact; the question is how are we going to handle it," said Joseph Giordano, a family therapist who operates a consulting firm called Ethnicity and Mental Health Associates, which helps school districts and neighborhood groups cope with ethnic tensions. "The melting-pot idea is analogous to the concept of the family -- it's like what the American family is supposed to be -- and it's filled with the same unreality. You have to work at relationships, whether they're family or community."
For Jim Sleeper, whose book "The Closest of Strangers" was strongly critical of a liberal politics based on race rather than common economic goals, the New York ideal is in part one of building upon ethnic identity to become part of a larger cosmopolitan community. The fraying of that ideal, he says, began in the confrontations over school decentralization in 1968, in which Sonny Carson and other black radicals were involved in hard-edged confrontations with teachers in Ocean Hill-Brownsville, who were white and usually Jewish.
"The whole city sort of collectively gasped because what they were saying is your civic ideal is dead," said Mr. Sleeper, an editorial writer for New York Newsday.
 
Skirting of Issues
 But preceding this was a monumental confrontation over establishment of a police civilian complaint review board in which thinly veiled anti-black statements were commonplace. A few years later white opposition to a low-income housing project in a mostly Jewish section, Forest Hills, Queens, continued a dissipation from every side.
The result, said Denis DeLeon, the city's Commissioner of Human Rights, was a skirting of issues involving integroup relations on the part of city government for years. Canarsie, he said, was re-enforced as an all-white enclave through a post-Forest Hills policy of having housing projects ethnically reflect the neighborhoods they were in, in the name of "neighborhood integrity."
"What passed for good intergroup relations were problems that were kept quiet," he said. "You would be handling intergroup relations well if no one heard about it. They didn't want to hear the Puerto Ricans and the Dominicans don't get along or that the Hasidic Jews and Caribbean blacks weren't getting along. We're having to pay for that and we will be for quite some time."
If this summer's problems in Canarsie followed a pattern that touched countless neighborhoods in which new ethnic groups emerged, one repeated since at least the days of "West Side Story," the Crown Heights situation is a special one. Here, on frequently lush streets of handsome town houses, private homes and low-slung apartment buildings, the Lubavitcher Hasidim have established their worldwide headquarters in a community that was the historic site of the first neighborhood of free blacks in the city and that had also become a storied Jewish neighborhood that was host to families in the generational journey from the slums and the suburbs.
While the edge of ethnic tension in other neighborhoods eventually eased as whites gave way to blacks, Hispanics and later Asians, the Lubavitcher community, which largely arrived after surviving Hitler's camps, grew under the powerful gaze of its Grand Rabbi, Menachem M. Schneerson. The religion required Lubavitchers to be within walking distance of their synagogues on the Sabbath and other holidays. To be near the rebbe, whose picture is evident in every Lubavitcher store and home, was an honor. And to keep a synagogue in operation after its congregation has withered, as many had in Crown Heights, is considered a "mitzvah," or good deed.
As the Lubavitcher community grew -- it numbers perhaps 15,00 in and around Crown Heights -- the black population grew as well. In the part of Crown Heights closest to the Lubavitchers alone, it numbers more than 85,000, according to the census, the majority now from many islands in the Caribbean.
In the neighborhood this week, there are Hasidim who point to boards they serve on with blacks as evidence of their willingness to work with their neighbors. However, among many leading blacks, the refrain is often the same -- that the Lubavitchers have shut themselves off from everyone else and used their political power to win housing money, poverty grants and other forms of government largesse far in excess of what their numbers would warrant.
 
Undercurrent of Bitterness
 Dr. Vernal G. Cave, a black physician who has lived and practiced on an exquisite block of President Street since 1955, recalled a successful drive by the Hasidim in 1976 to split the proposed Crown Heights community board district in two so the Lubavitchers would have great influence over the part of the neighborhood in which they lived.
How could a car accident involving a Hasidic driver and the death of a 7-year-old black boy trigger such black animosity toward the Lubavitchers?
"It goes back at least as far as 1976," Dr. Cave said. For many Lubavitchers, however, the eruption following the accident, in which a visiting Hasidic scholar from Australia was stabbed to death in what authorities say was an act of revenge, is unexplainable by anything other than misdirected prejudice.
"I think it goes beyond anti-Semitism," said Baruch Bush, an associate professor of law at Hofstra University. "This community, Hasidic Jews generally and Jews generally, have been made the butt and the direct target of all the anger that has arisen against the harms of white America to the black people. It's a kind of scapegoating. It happened in the European countryside. I think its happening here."
 
Sporadic Confrontations
 The last three decades have been dotted with other confrontations between the Lubavitchers and their black neighbors. The most pointed came in 1978, and it resonates eerily today. A black businessman named Arthur Miller died in a fight with the police after a traffic dispute, and, at about the same time, a black youth named Victor Rhodes was beaten by a mob of Hasidic youths who said he had knocked a hat from an elderly rabbi's head. Huge demonstrations by blacks ensued, covering the same streets as last week's protests and led by some of the same leaders.
For the moment, the situation seems frozen. Any hope for change involves the kindling of old ideals that have long been scarce in Crown Heights.
Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., who has done political battle with the Lubavitchers and who now deals with them more amicably as Brooklyn Democratic leader, looked back at a week marked by death and disruption and concluded, "We have two communities living side by side, but there's no social intercourse. If we want a different result, we on both sides have got to start doing something different."

HEADLINE: G.N.P. Fell 0.1 Percent In Quarter

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28

 BODY:
The economy contracted during the second quarter instead of expanding, revised Government figures showed today, suggesting that the recession lasted longer than had previously been thought.
Total output of goods and services edged down at an annual rate of a tenth of 1 percent, a tiny decline that nevertheless contrasted with the Commerce Department's estimate a month ago that output rose at a pace of four-tenths of 1 percent in the April-June period. 
 Most analysts tended to dismiss the fact that gross national product has now shrunk for the latest three quarters and remained confident that the recovery from recession, although almost certainly a desultory recovery, is now under way.
 
President Is Optimistic
 "It doesn't change the outlook very much -- and might even improve it," said Robert H. Chandross, the chief economist for Lloyds Bank North America in New York.
President Bush, when asked in Kennebunkport, Me., whether today's report meant continued recession, said he did not think so. "I feel all right about things," he said. "There are some statistics up and some down, but basically I think it's doing all right."
Most reports on economic activity so far this summer have portrayed an economic rebound, and even skeptics regard growth in G.N.P. for the third quarter to be a near certainty. A number of analysts said they did not expect the Federal Reserve to relax monetary policy further in response to today's revisions of the spring-quarter performance.
Traders in the financial markets, however, grasped at the prospect that signs of economic weakness might yet mean a new cut in interest rates by the Fed, which also trimmed rates earlier this month to give the economy a lift. That hope helped to inspire the stock market, where the Dow Jones industrial average gained 29.07 points to reach a new high of 3,055.23. [Page D8.] The G.N.P. report, coupled with a successful auction of new five-year Treasury notes, also helped to push up prices for Treasury securities in the credit market. [Page D18.]
 
Shattering an Illusion
 A minority of private analysts pointed to the latest G.N.P. figures as evidence of lingering weakness that to some implies no significant growth until next year.
"Today's downward revision of the second-quarter G.N.P. should shatter any remaining illusion of an economic recovery," said Lawrence A. Hunter, deputy chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce. "This third consecutive quarter of economic contraction removes all doubt about the continuing economic stagnation."
A prominent reason for caution, some analysts say, is a wavering of confidence among consumers, the source of two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. The ABC News/ Money Magazine Consumer Index was calculated today at minus 38 on a scale ranging from plus 100 to minus 100. The index, based on consumer ratings of the economy, consumers' personal finances and the buying climate, is down one point for the week and within five points of its record low of minus 43, set on Oct. 28.
Albert Sindlinger, a longtime pollster, said today that consumer incomes had slumped to a 36-year low, in part because of taxes not included in Government inflation statistics.
 
Depleted Inventories
 The main factors dragging the G.N.P. into negative territory were more rapid reductions in business inventories and lower personal spending. Analysts noted, however, that depleted inventories represent a positive factor for gauging future economic activity, since any increase in demand will quickly require stepped-up production.
"This sets up the possibility of significant economic growth in the second half of the year," said Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist a Merrill Lynch & Company.
Businesses cut inventories at a $27.7 billion rate in the April-June quarter instead of the $21.2 billion pace initially estimated, a difference of $6.5 billion, the Commerce Department report showed.
Analysts also tended to playdown the $5.1 billion downward revision in personal spending, which shrank the annual growth rate to 2.8 percent from 3.6 percent. Much of the reduction reflected what were, in effect, accounting changes that shifted car purchases from individuals to businesses.
 
Daunting Task for Auto Makers
 Even optimists, however, cautioned that the automobile business faced a daunting sales task in coming months, since it has imposed significant price increases that exceed current rebate programs.
The biggest upward revisions in today's G.N.P. report were a $4.1 billion improvement in foreign trade -- imports were $3.1 billion lower than first estimated and exports $1 billion higher -- and a $3.4 billion rise in the output of producers' durable equipment.
Over all, analysts said that while they did not consider the half-point revision in G.N.P. to be large, it was somewhat surprising that it was downward and into negative territory. Based on experience, the department said the chances were two out of three that in the future, revisions of second-quarter G.N.P. would not be worse than a four-tenths of 1 percent rate of decline or better than a five-tenths of 1 percent rate of advance.
The G.N.P. declined at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the first quarter of 1991 and 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.
 
Inflation at 3 Percent
 Inflation, as gauged by the fixed-weight G.N.P. price index that assumes the composition of output does not change, ran at 3 percent during the quarter, the same pace as estimated in late July. The nation's savings rate, however, is now seen as remaining at 4.2 percent instead of falling a half point as initially estimated in July's advance report.
G.N.P. in current dollars rather than 1982 dollars fell to a 4.2 annual percent rate of increase in the second quarter from 4.6 percent in last month's report.
Today's report also included the Government's first calculation of corporate profits for the spring quarter.
Profits from current production -- before tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments -- rose $1.7 billion, or six-tenths of 1 percent, to $287.9 billion at an annual rate. This compared with a decline of $2.7 billion, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, in the first quarter.
Increases were posted in manufacturing, trade and the transportation and public utilities group, while profits fell in other nonmanufacturing industries, the department stated.
Profits before taxes, but without adjustments, rose seven-tenths of 1 percent after falling 7.4 percent in the first quarter, and profits after taxes fell 1.6 percent, compared with a 6.3 percent drop during the winter. But current-production cash flow, a measure of a company's ability to finance projects internally, edged up only a tenth of 1 percent after rising 3.5 percent in the first quarter.

Court Backs Trump's Plan To Shed Half of Taj Mahal

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J., Aug. 28

 BODY:
A Federal Bankruptcy Court judge today approved a plan by Donald J. Trump's Taj Mahal Casino Resort to restructure its giant debt by surrendering half the developer's equity in the Atlantic City property.
The plan, which gives bondholders the equity in exchange for their acceptance of lower interest rates, was approved after a 4 1/2-hour hearing by Bankruptcy Judge Rosemary Gambardella. The approval came just six weeks after the Taj Mahal filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors. 
 Most bankruptcies drag on for months or even years. But the casino expedited the process by securing the necessary bondholder approvals beforehand.
 
Delay Is Averted
 The only potential delay was averted late in the day when Dixie-Narco Inc., a Williston, S.C.-based company, settled its claim against the casino.
Dixie-Narco had demanded payment for 1,350 bill-changing machines it supplied the Taj Mahal. The company contended that Mr. Trump solicited the bondholders improperly because he had said Dixie-Narco's $6 million claim was worthless.
Lawyers for Dixie-Narco withdrew their objections after reaching a settlement for $2.4 million to be paid in increasing installments through December 1994. The casino will also give back 500 of the machines it has stored. Mr. Trump, who did not attend the bankruptcy hearing, had contended that the change machines frequently broke down at the casino's April 1990 opening, dealing the casino a setback from which it is only now recovering.
The only testimony today came from Henry Hornbostel, the casino's senior vice president of finance, and Wilbur Ross, the main adviser to the bondholder steering committee.
Mr. Hornbostel testified that the restructuring should be approved because creditors -- including bondholders with $675 million in notes -- would fare worse in a liquidation. A casino prospectus estimated that they would receive 43.4 percent of their money.
 
A Cushion Against Downturns
 Mr. Ross testified that the casino's debt-service requirements under the restructuring would total roughly $70 million, leaving it a cushion against unexpected downturns. Failure to approve the plan quickly would prove costly, Mr. Ross said.
"I think it would be a disaster," he said. "It would have tragic consequences for the secured creditors and probably end up wiping out the unsecured creditors.
The Taj Mahal's emergence from bankruptcy does not end Mr. Trump's casino problems. His Trump Castle Casino Resort hopes to file a plan similar to the Taj Mahal by the fall to restructure its debt-laden finances.

HEADLINE: 29.07 Gain Lifts Dow to a Record of 3,055.23

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Stock prices jumped sharply yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average surging past the record it set last week. Traders were cheered by what they saw as a growing prospect of declining interest rates in the wake of new Government economic data.
After slipping 14 points in the week's first two sessions, the Dow gained 29.07 yesterday, or 1 percent, to close at 3,055.23, erasing the record set on Friday, 3,040.25. 
 The market reacted to a Commerce Department report that the gross national product, adjusted for inflation, declined in the second quarter at an annual rate of a tenth of 1 percent. That figure came as a surprise after the Government's earlier estimate that the economy had grown at a rate of four-tenths of 1 percent.
"The G.N.P. figures along with other data foretell the possibility of a bigger increase in unemployment," said Gene J. Seagle, director of technical research for Gruntal & Company. "So the Federal Reserve has something to worry about. And with the economy having been starved by high interest rates, there is great anticipation that the Fed will do something about interest rates."
Also, analysts suggested that the Commerce figures on lower second- quarter inventories were likely to stimulate economic growth in the third quarter.
The Dow moved decisively all day, apart from a brief decline after 10 A.M. Of the Dow's 30 stocks, 25 posted increases.
Advancing issues outpaced declining ones by a margin of more than 2 to 1, with 1,063 up and 519 down. Volume on the Big Board totaled 172 million shares, up from 144.7 million on Tuesday.
 
Merck Leads Advance
 Leading the Dow's rise was Merck, up 2 3/4, to 127 7/8. The company said it would create a worldwide manufacturing division next week. Other big movers on the Dow were Coca-Cola, up 1 3/4, to 66 3/8, and Boeing, up 1 1/8, to 50 1/8. The three accounted for more than a third of the Dow's rise.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 4.54 points, to 526.29, a gain of nearly nine-tenths of 1 percent. The American Stock Exchange's composite index was up 1, to 370.62. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 3.58, to 396.64. And the New York Stock Exchange's composite index was up 1.91, to 217.17.
The most active issue on the Big Board was Telefono de Mexico, the national telecommunications company. The Mexican Government had owned a majority of the company, but it has been privatized in the last year, with the Government continuing to sell small blocks of shares in recent months. The stock was up 5/8, to 37 3/8, with 2.7 million shares changing hands.
A big gainer on the New York Stock Exchange was McDonnell Douglas, up 3 1/2, to 54 1/2. Analysts said the stock rose on speculation that the company would not be significantly affected by proposed cuts in military spending.
The biggest percentage gainer was Manhattan National, a holding company for life insurers. The stock rose nearly 37 percent, gaining 2 1/8, to 7 7/8, after the company announced that it was considering a plan to spin off its Manhattan Life subsidiary and liquidate the company's remaining assets.
The most active Amex issue was Bolar Pharmaceutical, up 2 3/4, to 8 1/4, on 2.2 million shares. The company agreed Tuesday to pay SmithKline Beecham $40 million to settle a lawsuit involving a generic version of a SmithKline blood presure drug. The payment was lower than had been expected.
In over-the-counter trading, the most-active issue was Seagate Technology, a computer company. The stock was up 3/4, to 10 5/8 on 2.5 million shares. The company's Japanese subsidiary said yesterday that it would build a plant in central Japan to produce hard-disk drives.

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
LITHUANIANS FREE OF SOVIET DRAFT

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VILNIUS, Lithuania, Aug. 28

 BODY:
The Soviet Government has agreed to stop conscripting Lithuanian youths and to release those now serving in the Soviet Army, further indicating Soviet moves toward acceptance of Lithuania's independence, President Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania announced today.
Mr. Landsbergis spoke after meeting with the new Soviet military commander for the Baltic region, Lieut. Gen. Vladislav Mironov, who was appointed on Sunday. 
 Although no announcement was made about conscription in the two other Baltic republics, Latvia and Estonia, aides to Mr. Landsbergis said they presumed that the same policy would be applied there.
Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union more than a year ago, but only in the wake of the failed coup in Moscow last week has the Soviet Government started to acknowledge that the declaration is irreversible.
This week, foreign nations began granting diplomatic recognition to Lithuania as a sovereign state. According to official figures, 23 nations have thus far extended formal recognition to Lithuania, which was annexed by the Soviet Union with Latvia and Estonia as a consequence of a secret Stalin-Hitler pact on the eve of World War II.
Asked about the reluctance of the United States to extend immediate recognition, Mr. Landsbergis replied, "We can wait a little longer."
 
Delegations Pour In
 Delegations from foreign countries are pouring into Lithuania and the other Baltic republics. Italians and Norwegians have been in Vilnius seeking to rent space for a diplomatic mission, and a group of Danish legislative specialists is here for meetings with local political leaders. Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France is scheduled to tour the region on Thursday.
At Lithuanian border crossings, Soviet guards have begun giving way to Lithuanians, although the situation at some crossings is still confused. Mr. Landsbergis acknowledged today that he did not know who was in control of all border posts.
Despite the rapid moves toward independence after more than half a century of Soviet rule, there is no euphoria on the streets of Vilnius. Much of the world's attention may be focused here, but for Lithuanians today was just another normal day.
"At the beginning, when we first got the sense that we were really going to be free, people were very excited," one shopkeeper said. "Now we are starting to realize the trouble that is ahead. We are all happy that this is happening, but we are also worried."
Lithuania imports nearly all of its raw materials from the Soviet Union, and most of its manufactured goods have been sold there or in Soviet-bloc countries.
Two generations of farmers have lived and worked on collective farms, and many are worried about having to make the transition to private farming. In the cities, fear of unemployment is widespread.
 
Lithuanian Tension
 When Soviet hard-liners orchestrated a coup against President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last week, Lithuanians feared that their hopes for peaceful secession might be crushed.
The tension that has ruled in Lithuania, especially since a crackdown by Soviet forces in January, was still visible today at the barricaded Parliament building here. Militiamen guard all entrances, and no one may enter without a written invitation from someone inside. Journalists assigned there must obtain new accreditation every day.
Inside the building, sandbags block most staircases. Soldiers armed with single-shot carbines patrol the corridors. President Landsbergis is heavily guarded, and many government officials have been sleeping in their offices for the last week.
"Some people think the barricades should stay up until the last Soviet soldier is gone," said Rita Dapkus, a government spokeswoman who is among those officials now sleeping in their offices.
At his news conference today, Mr. Landsbergis said he hoped that the withdrawal of the estimated 80,000 Soviet soldiers from Lithuania would begin this year, and be completed by 1994.
The Soviet Government has not announced a timetable for withdrawing its troops from the Baltic republics. Mr. Landsbergis said General Mironov had told him he was not yet authorized to negotiate that question.
Mr. Landsbergis said he was satisfied with the position of the Soviet Union's new military commanders.
"General Mironov told me that the mood is changing in Moscow," Mr. Landsbergis said. "According to him, Soviet soldiers posted in the Baltic republics are being educated in the new realities here."
"This is very important, because it shows the new attitude of the military command," he said. "There is now a basis for mutual understanding, and it is growing stronger. Soviet military leaders are now willing to negotiate the return of buildings and documents."
Mr. Landsbergis said he had been assured that the conscription of Lithuanian youths into the Soviet Army would end immediately. He said the question of releasing Lithuanians now in the army, who officials here said are believed to number less than 1,000, "is being resolved, and will be resolved very soon."
Among Soviet soldiers posted here are members of elite units trained in counterterrorism. Lithuanian leaders consider their presence threatening, and have asked that they be the first to be withdrawn.

Germany Recognizes Baltics
 BONN, Aug. 28 (AP) -- Germany granted official diplomatic recognition today to Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, 52 years after Nazi Germany signed over their freedom to the Soviet Union.
[New Zealand also recognized the three, Reuters reported.]
"From our point of view, it is only today that the last consequences of World War II have been done away with," Lennart Meri, Estonia's Foreign Minister, said before he, his two Baltic counterparts and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany signed papers establishing diplomatic ties.
"For us, the war lasted about eight times longer than in Germany and Europe," Mr. Meri said.

HEADLINE: Economic Reform Aiding Peronist Campaign

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Aug. 28

 BODY:
For Peronist party candidates seeking office on Sept. 8 in Argentina's mid-term elections, the hottest product they have to offer voters is the Economy Minister, Domingo Felipe Cavallo.
The situation is certainly unusual. Mr. Cavallo, who is not a member of the Peronist or any other party, has been taking to the hustings for the last two weeks, pleading with voters to vote Peronist so his plan to rejuvenate the economy will have a chance to succeed. 
 "We've never had an Economy Minister active in a campaign, but there is such a wave of confidence right now in Cavallo's economic plan," said Manuel Mora y Araujo, one of the country's leading polltakers. "Cavallo is the principal representative of that plan and has become very, very popular."
So popular, according to Mr. Mora y Araujo's lastest polls, that Mr. Cavallo's approval ratings, at 52 percent, are about the same as those of the country's Peronist President, Carlos Saul Menem, at 53 percent.
The popularity of the plan itself, which has lowered tariffs, stabilized the country's currency, halted the printing of money by the central bank and mandated a budget surplus, is soaring, with 62 percent of those polled saying they support it.
After bouts with inflation that exceeded 6,000 percent from 1989 through 1990, Mr. Cavallo has over the last four months produced the lowest inflation level here in almost two decades.
"It's a tremendous asset for this Government that people can put their money in the bank on Friday and not worry that it's lost value on Monday," said Robert Cortes Conde, a prominent economist.
For the last six months, President Menem has been plagued by a host of personal scandals, including charges that his in-laws and top aides were involved in money laundering.
But Mr. Menem's ratings, which reached their lowest point in March, have risen steadily since, as the Cavallo plan has gained credibility.
For many here, though Mr. Cavallo protests that he does not like politicking, his willingness to go on the campaign trail is seen as offering himself as a credible figure to succeed Mr. Menem as President in 1994.
His international stature has soared since he introduced his economic plan in March and successfully negotiated a $1 billion standby loan from the International Monetary Fund.
Many candidates of the Radical Party, the primary opposition to the Peronists, have adopted an "if you can't beat them, join them" attitude. In the provinces of Santa Fe and Cordoba, Radical Party candidates are openly supporting the Cavallo plan.
Analysts here predict that the mid-term congressional, gubernatorial and municipal elections could represent a big victory for Mr. Menem and his policies of orienting the country toward the industrialized nations, especially the United States.
Three provinces held early elections this month, with the Personists scoring a upset victory in San Juan. Also in next month's elections, Eduardo Angeloz, the Radical Party's most prominent politician and Mr. Menem's opponent in the 1989 presidential elections, is struggling to win a third term as Governor of Cordoba, the country's second most important industrial center. There, the Peronist candidate, Jose Manuel de la Sota, has shown a surprising increase in popularity and is running almost even with Mr. Angeloz.

Taylor Finally Signs And Hits the Big Time

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN

 BODY:
Final details had finally been settled and Brien Taylor's historic $1.55 million contract was finally signed. Taylor had officially become a Yankee.
Scott Boras, who had operated under the title of adviser in the semantics of baseball economics, was officially becoming an agent. Bettie Taylor, whose resoluteness had led directly to her son's wealth, now wore the hat of the team she had rooted for as a child in Beaufort, N.C. There appeared to be more than enough happily-ever-after for everyone yesterday at Yankee Stadium. 
 The business of baseball was transformed into the ceremony of sport, complete with hot lights, a baseball hat and a jersey for the Yankee future.
 
Meet No. 19
 Once the procession of deal-makers moved slowly through the mob, Taylor stood behind a podium and microphone and clutched the pinstriped jersey to his chest with both hands. It was an old jersey, No. 19, with the name "Righetti" stitched on the inside collar under Taylor's chin.
"He told me, 'I never saw this many cameras,' " said Gene Michael, the Yankee vice president and general manager. "I never saw that many myself."
Taylor's first professional moment in the bright lights completed a dizzying five-day period of rapidly spiraling offers, intense negotiations, an arrival and departure from junior college, a trip to New York, and a lifetime of financial security.
Two days before, he stood in a quiet gymnasium on the campus of Louisburg College, holding a class schedule in his hands. One day before, there were two people wearing Yankee hats on an airplane from North Carolina to New York, and neither fan recognized Taylor.
Those days may be gone forever. Yesterday afternoon, at the start of Taylor's first visit to a big-league ball park, the people waiting at the entrance called his name.
"It was quite amazing," Taylor said, still clutching the jersey to his chest. "I stopped and looked around. I heard people hollering and screaming at me. It kind of intimidated me."
That was an uncharacteristic but understandable response from a 19-year-old who became the first high school pitcher taken as the first choice in the June baseball draft in 18 years. Once his contract was completed, he took a tour of the stadium he hopes to reach within two years.
"It was quite amazing," he said. "I'm used to fields with a little fence around them."
His competitive career will not begin until mid-September, when Taylor pitches for the Yankee team in the instructional league. Taylor, who has not competed since the end of his high school season at the beginning of June, has worked with his father, Ray, a brick mason, and pitched to a cousin or friends in the evening.
Michael said that he hoped that Taylor would be able to report to the organization's complex in Tampa, Fla., as soon as next week to begin preparing for the instructional league and make up for the time lost during the 12 weeks of negotiations.
When Taylor was asked when he hoped to reach the Bronx, it seemed as if 1993 had become a goal. "It should be two years," Taylor said. "I want to make it in two years."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Steinbrenner's Role In Signing of Taylor Perturbs McMullen

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Not much is heard from George Steinbrenner these days, but he spoke up just in time for the Yankees to surrender to a 19-year-old high school pitcher from North Carolina, who never wanted to go to college but used the threat as an effective negotiating ploy.
Now others are beginning to speak out angrily about the Yankees' decision. The signing of Brien Taylor to a $1.55 million contract instantly outraged other clubs because of the impact it will have on current and future negotiations with amateur draft picks. 
 "These big tycoons in New York let a 19-year-old kid from North Carolina snooker them out of a million dollars," an angry John McMullen, owner of the Houston Astros, said yesterday. "It's total sheer irresponsibility. Every time you think it can't get worse, it does. It's a complete outrage."
Saying publicly what he is not permitted to do privately, Steinbrenner sent a clear message to the incumbent decision-makers that he wanted them to sign Taylor, the No. 1 selection in the June draft, whatever the cost. He added a tag line, through a reporter, that in his mind would rationalize the remarkable expenditure.
It was the Oakland Athletics, the owner said, who set the standard for a top draft choice by giving Todd Van Poppel $1.2 million last year. When he was allowed to make the decisions and spent lavishly on free agents, Steinbrenner always blamed other clubs for establishing the market. Although he spent more money on free agents than anyone, he was always reluctantly keeping pace but never forging new economic territory. Or so he said.
McMullen, for one, doesn't buy that. He and other baseball people see the Van Poppel signing as an aberration because that high school pitcher legitimately was intent on going to college and the Athletics had to buy his change of mind. Now, with the $1.55 million payment to Taylor, who never expressed interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer or even a college freshman, the Yankees have established the standard for the next draft and those that will follow, not to mention this year's draft choices who have yet to sign.
Discussing the Van Poppel deal, McMullen said, "I know the Yankees blame it on Oakland, but two wrongs don't make a right."
The Taylor signing affects McMullen and the Astros immediately. They have the No. 6 pick, John Burke, also a pitcher, and McMullen said they have offered him a signing bonus in the area established by the bonuses given the fourth ($385,000) and seventh ($345,000) selections. (The fifth pick, Kenny Henderson, is unsigned.)
But on Tuesday, McMullen said, Scott Boras, the agent who advised Taylor and is advising Burke, called the Astros and asked for $1 million.
"This has killed Milwaukee and San Diego and ourselves," McMullen said, referring to the teams that have the other unsigned pitchers whom Boras is advising.
 
Strawberry's Impact
 As a Christian, Darryl Strawberry says he was reborn last winter. As a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers, he appears to have been reborn six weeks ago. That's when he hit a three-run home run against David Cone of the Mets, triggering a personal surge in which he hit 14 home runs and drove in 40 runs in 36 games. It was by far Strawberry's finest, most productive period of the first season of his five-year, $20.25 million contract.
"Darryl pretty much has come around," Gary Carter, his teammate with the Mets and the Dodgers, said. "He is capable of carrying a team, and I feel he'll do that in September. If there's a time to rise to the occasion, it's now. He's been tremendous since the All-Star Game break. I foresee bigger and better things out of Darryl the rest of season."
But those things may have to be significantly bigger and better if Strawberry is to carry the Dodgers to the National League West championship. Despite his most productive period, which ran from July 18 through last Sunday, the Dodgers emerged from a 36-game span with 19 victories and 17 defeats and a lead over the Atlanta Braves that shrank from three and a half games to one.
In other words, Strawberry's best has not been good enough to propel the Dodgers away from the surprising upstart, the relentless Braves, who were tied for first entering last night's games.
When Strawberry was languishing with a .232 batting average, 8 home runs and 31 runs batted in his first 65 games, the Dodgers, even with a seven-game losing streak immediately after the All-Star Game break, had a 49-38 record. That record was better than the Dodgers have done since Strawberry started hitting. They have not been able to capitalize on his rebirth and have lost ground in the division race instead of pulling away.
The reduced output of Juan Samuel, Eddie Murray and Kal Daniels has diluted the effect of Strawberry's revival.
Samuel has batted .231 since reaching a season-high .340 June 10. In a combined 223 games before the break, Murray, Daniels and Samuel combined for 27 home runs and 135 runs batted in, an average of one home run every 8.3 games and one r.b.i. every 1.7 games. In 117 games since the break, they have 8 home runs and 42 r.b.i., an average of one home run every 14.6 games and one r.b.i. every 2.8 games.
Seeing that his bat wasn't helping enough, Strawberry last weekend decided to try his mouth. He told reporters that impending free agency for a sizable group of Dodgers, including Murray and Orel Hershiser, has been a distraction. It puts pressure on the whole team, he said. It weighs on players' minds when the focus should be on winning.
Is this the same Darryl Strawberry who last year approached his free agency during the Mets' pennant chase by alternately saying he wanted to go to Los Angeles and he wanted to stay in New York? Is he now speaking from experience, offering a wisdom he didn't have a year ago, or does he forget his role in the Mets' failure?
 
Mound Chores
 Wally Whitehurst, whom the Mets chose over Ron Darling as their fifth starter, has not won a game since July 4, making seven unsuccessful starts since. But he is only second in the major leagues among starting pitchers who have labored the longest and most often without a victory.
Chris Nabholz of Montreal last won a game May 27. He has started nine times since without emerging with a victory. He has had shoulder trouble in that period of drought, missing seven weeks and many more starts he might not have won.
On the same night, Tuesday, that Whitehurst and Nabholz failed to win once more, Pascual Perez of the Yankees extended his personal drought to six starts. Also plagued by a shoulder ailment, Perez has not won since his first start, May 14. Danny Jackson of the Chicago Cubs and Bobby Witt of Texas, both of whom also have been hurt this season, each have made six starts without winning, Jackson last having gained a victory June 14 and Witt May 26.
Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd has not won any of the six starts he has made for the Rangers since they acquired him from Montreal last month.

Atomic Age Interrupts A Dance With the Sun

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M., Aug. 25

 BODY:
The Pueblo Indians called this city "the dancing ground of the sun." D. H. Lawrence memorialized the looming Sangre de Cristo Mountains. And this summer, residents and visitors to Santa Fe, a city in which the night can still be pierced by howling coyotes, have been routinely treated to sound and light shows as thunderstorms flashed across northern New Mexico, extending the white-water rafting season on the Rio Grande.
Yet for all the awesome power that nature routinely displays, many people in the nation's oldest state capital seem more concerned with the potential consequences of a force unleashed by humans at nearby Los Alamos National Laboratory, home of the atom bomb. 
 As early as next week, the United States Department of Energy is expected to certify that it is ready to begin testing the nation's first repository for military-related radioactive wastes from around the country. The $900 million underground dump in salt beds just east of Carlsbad is to store plutonium-contaminated tools, clothing and other debris.
Debris from Los Alamos could eventually pass through Santa Fe on a main street, St. Francis Drive.
Federal officials maintain that any threat to Santa Fe residents would be further diminished if a bypass road contemplated by state and Federal officials is finished before the department completes several years of test runs, shipping less dangerous wastes from Colorado and another national laboratory in Idaho over other routes.
But opponents from the Citizens Concerned for Nuclear Safety and other groups predict that the opening of the repository will be indefinitely delayed by legal hurdles and by Congressional intervention.
For a century, the dancing light of the skies of northern New Mexico and the splendid isolation have lured artists. More recently, people have come to escape congestion and pollution elsewhere. They have no pride of ownership in the atomic bomb. In contrast to the secrecy that surrounded the bomb project and partly as a consequence, the proposed nuclear repository has become a hot subject.
Opposition to the the repository, the Waste Isolation Pilot Project, or WIPP, is suggested by the sparse graffiti that mars Santa Fe's ubiquitous adobe. One message warns, "WIPP Is the Final Shaft."
But what is striking is the degree to which local businesses have been organized in opposition. Dozens of stores and restaurants display signs that identify them as "Another Business Against Wipp."
Katharine Kagel, a 43-year-old who moved here from California and runs the trendy Cafe Pasqual, said her opposition was based mostly on environmental concerns. "It's health, it's tourism, it's safety." she said. "We all chose to move here because it's primitive and wonderful, but this goes beyond not-in-my-backyard. It has to do with common sense."
Richard L. Johnson, the 42-year-old owner of the Cognito clothing store and director of the business opposition, agreed. "This is more than an environmental issue," said Mr. Johnson, another former Californian. "It's a health and safety issue. It's a tourism and economic issue. An accident has the tendency to turn tourist towns into ghost towns."
Tourism remains Santa Fe's dominant industry. The annual Indian Market weekend earlier this month attracted thousands of customers to stalls stocked with pottery and with silver and turquoise trinkets.
Santa Fe's chic informality contrasts with the bleaker conditions on the pueblos and elsewhere in the state that propelled New Mexico's welfare caseload to a record high last month. Poverty also accounts for some of the support for the radioactive waste dump in communities where it has generated jobs.
"They look to needy states where people will do anything for jobs," said Ira Estin, a river guide for the Southwest Adventure Group.
Thomas Lett, the state Department of Public Safety's WIPP coordinator, said he was not worried about the chance of an accident. But he expressed other reservations about the prospect of trucks loaded with radioactive waste passing by his home.
"The darn things are going to be weighing 80,000 pounds and will tear up the street," Mr. Lett complained.

HEADLINE: Study Shows Passing AIDS in Breast Milk Is Easier Than Thought

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28

 BODY:
Mothers can transmit AIDS to their infants through breast milk at a far higher rate than previously believed, researchers have found.
The study raises the question of whether infected mothers in developing countries should continue to breast-feed. The World Health Organization says they should because the risks of not breast-feeding are even greater. But in developed countries, the advice has long been the opposite: infected mothers are advised not to breast-feed. 
 In the study, carried out in Kigali, the capital of the Central African nation of Rwanda, researchers found that among 16 mothers who apparently were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, between a quarter and a half passed the infection on to their infants through breast-feeding.
Until now, preliminary studies indicated that infants could but were not likely to become infected through breast-feeding.
 
'Dangerous to Ignore'
 The report, in Thursday's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, was the largest and most careful study of the subject yet published.
Dr. Michael Merson, director of the World Health Organization's Global Program on AIDS, said today that while the news was discouraging, the organization believed that women who did not have access to clean water and affordable infant formula should continue to breast-feed regardless of their infection.
Dr. Jonathan Mann, director of the Harvard AIDS Institute and former the chief of the health organization's global program on AIDS, said today that the study raised serious questions but that advising women in developing countries not to breast-feed would be a mistake now.
"I think the danger today would be to overreact and overinterpret this study," he said. "I also think it would be dangerous to ignore it."
He said more work should be done to determine whether it was riskier to an infant for an infected woman to breast-feed or for her to switch to possibly contaminated water and infant formula.
Dr. Susan Holck, chief of policy and planning at the health organization's Global Program on AIDS, said the risk of infant death from using contaminated water in making infant formula was several times higher than the risk of death from AIDS transmitted by breast-feeding even if the new, higher rates were taken into account.
In addition, formula is so expensive for the people of many countries that its use could be an economic catastrophe for the woman and her family as well.
 
9 of 16 Babies Infected
 In the United States, where clean water is generally available and infant formula relatively inexpensive, the federal Centers for Disease Control recommended in a policy established in 1985 that women infected with the AIDS virus should not breast-feed in most cases.
The study enrolled 212 pregnant women who came to the Hospital Center of Kigali, each of whom tested negative for the AIDS virus through the time of birth. Among those, 16 women tested positive for HIV antibodies three months or more after giving birth. It was believed that they became infected after birth either through sex or transfusions.
Nine of these women passed the infection on to their children. The authors of the study said it was possible that several of the nine women were actually infected during their pregnancy but did not appear positive in the first tests after birth. In those cases the babies could have been infected in the womb.
But four infants were most likely to have been infected by breast-feeding and four more may have been, wrote Dr. Phillipe Van de Perre, chief author of the study and a researcher at the National AIDS Control Program in Rwanda.
 
Results Are Hailed
 Dr. Holck hailed the results, "even though they don't change our minds about the recommendations we have for women."
"They show that the rate of transmission is much higher than we thought by this route, maybe as high as 50 percent chance of infants becoming infected."
It was an important finding for at least two other reasons.
First, the AIDS virus was already known to occur in breast milk but it was not known how efficiently the virus was transmitted to infants. The new results, Dr. Holck said, are encouraging, at least in showing that not all infected women transmit the virus through their milk."
Second, if the risk of infection is higher than thought, it may be more urgent for women to know whether they are infected or not in case they should become pregnant.
In a study published earlier this year, the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences recommended against mandatory screening of pregnant women for the AIDS virus. The report encouraged women to get tested, however.
The authors of the new study said they may have found an especially high rate of passing the disease by breast-feeding because the women in this study, like all people who have just been infected, had very high numbers of viruses in their bodies and thus may be more infectious than at other times in the course of the disease.
Thus, if a woman is infected long before becoming pregnant, her chance of passing the disease along by breast-feeding may be smaller than that for a women infected at or just after pregnancy.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Schools Cost More but Achieve Less

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28

 BODY:
The Education Department today made public a back-to-school report that Education Secretary Lamar Alexander said would give a "heightened sense of urgency" to passage of President Bush's proposed education legislation.
The report predicted record spending on education at all levels and an increased enrollment of children in preschool programs. But Government officials said increased expenditures for each pupil had not translated into better educated students. 
 "Enrollment is up, spending is up, achievement is down," said Diane Ravitch, Assistant Secretary for the Office of Educational Research and Improvement.
Dr. Ravitch, David T. Kearns, the Deputy Secretary of Education, and Emerson Elliott, acting commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, attended a meeting with reporters at the Education Department's headquarters, where Mr. Alexander made public the annual report.
The report showed that the number of 3- and 4-year-old children enrolled in 56 preschool programs rose to 3.3 million in the 1990-91 school year from 2.3 million in 1980-81, a 44 percent increase.
Total education spending in the United States is expected to reach $414 billion in the 1990-91 school year, up 5.5 percent from the previous year and a record high. But when adjusted for inflation, the spending on education rose only slightly, to $395.7 billion in 1991 dollars. In the 1989-90 school year education spending was $385.1 billion after adjustment for inflation.
The report said elementary and high schools were expected to spend $249 billion in the 1991-92 school year, up 5 percent from $237 billion in 1990-91. Colleges and universities will spend about $165 billion in 1991-92, up from $155.4 billion last year.
But Dr. Ravitch, a former professor at Columbia University's Teacher's College, said increased spending and educational staff at the elementary and secondary level had not halted declines in student achievement noted in a survey by the National Assessment of Educational Progress released last year.
Dr. Ravitch also said studies showed that reading skills were improved when children read and were read to by their parents, but that such improvements were not finding their way into the classroom.
"The things we know that are contributing to achievement aren't happening," she said.
Asked whether the attempts by some communities to improve their schools through schools limited to students of one sex, as Detroit unsuccessfully proposed with an all-black male school, Mr. Alexander endorsed the 1954 Supreme Court decision in the Brown v. Board of Education case, which found that segregated schools are inherently unequal.
 
Lobbying Efforts Planned
 "Fortunately, we're returning to school this year with a national strategy for improving education and for helping the nation reach its education goals," the Secretary said, referring to the Bush Administration's education legislation, known as the America 2000 education plan.
Mr. Alexander said there would be some "stepped-up activities" around the country by the President and Mrs. Bush next month and in October to press for passage of the Administration's package of education legislation, which includes a plan to allow parents to have a choice of which school their children would attend.
Mr. Bush will visit Lewiston, Me., on Sept. 3 to talk about the proposal, Mr. Alexander said. And beginning on Sept. 4, the President will hold a conference call each day at 11:55 A.M. with the mayors and governors from areas that have designated themselves as America 2000 communities.
The Secretary also said that on Oct. 1 Mr. Bush plans to address the nation's children about the importance of education.

HEADLINE: St. Louis Rebuilding a Once-Grand Theater Area

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
Once called the Broadway of the Midwest, the long-neglected midtown theater district in St. Louis is undergoing a renovation that may make it a model redevelopment project to rival Playhouse Square in Cleveland, the Music Center in Los Angeles and Lincoln Center in New York.
The $125 million Grand Center redevelopment project, which is expected to be completed by the turn of the century, is to include the construction of up to six new performing spaces for dance, theater, opera and chamber music, created in existing and new buildings, as well as restaurants, art galleries, craft stores and artists' studios and support facilities like prop and scenery building shops and rehearsal spaces. And Grand Center is hoping to lure KETC, the public broadcasting station in St. Louis, to planned new video facilities that could make the city a major advertising center. 
 Richard Gaddes and Thom Digman, two prime movers in the Grand Center project, laughingly describe themselves as "missionaries and parking lot kings." And that sums up the balance between artistic vision and commercial instinct that informs the project, which covers a once rundown and abandoned eight-block area in midtown St. Louis.
 
14 Theaters in Area Once
 From the 1920's through the 1940's, the section bisected by North Grand Boulevard between Delmar Boulevard and Olive Street boasted 14 theaters for movies, vaudeville and Broadway-bound plays and musicals. "It was a textbook of architecture," Mr. Gaddes said. But by the mid-1960's the district had become dingy and dispirited. St. Louis had become a national symbol of urban decay, with the flight of businesses and private citizens to the suburbs, though Eero Saarinen's soaring new Gateway Arch was beginning to serve as a symbol of hope and a thriving tourist attraction.
A revitalization effort was begun, led by the Rev. Paul Reinert, chancellor emeritus of St. Louis University, a major institution in the area. In 1966, the St. Louis Symphony moved into a refurbished Powell Symphony Hall, a former movie and vaudeville house built in the mid-1920's. The decaying 4,500-seat Fox Theater, a glittering neo-Byzantine movie palace built in 1929, was privately purchased in 1981 and restored to its former glory, re-opening as a theater for Broadway-style shows, ballet and popular music concerts. And the modernized Sheldon Concert Hall, a prim little chamber music hall famous for acoustics that rivaled those of Carnegie Hall, was once more in the business of presenting concerts.
Redevelopment faltered in the mid-1980's when tax changes reduced investment incentives. But the fact that the three theaters were selling over a million tickets a year suggested that the reclamation of the area was commercially viable. In 1987, Grand Center Inc. was formed. Mr. Gaddes, an arts administrator and opera impresario, was enlisted as president of the non-profit institution, which will own and operate the district's theaters, and of City Center Redevelopment, its subsidiary, whose functions include the acquisition and management of the properties. Mr. Digman became the vice president of City Center Redevelopment.
"This is all I've ever really wanted to do," Mr. Digman said. "I've known and loved this neighborhood for a long time."
 
Support for the Project
 Over $14 million of the $24 million needed for the first phase has been raised. Support for the project has come primarily from Civic Progress, an organization of leaders of major St. Louis corporations, from the city of St. Louis and from the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, local arts commissions and private contributors.
In the first phase, one of the city's major galleries has purchased a building and opened a new gallery in the area. Seven arts organizations have relocated to an arts administration complex in the old Missouri Theater Building. As Mr. Gaddes expected, the groups can now share ideas and information -- and save money -- in hard and competitive economic times.
Work has begun on the Grandel Square Theater, a handsome 1883 limestone building that was once a church and that will now serve as a home theater for the St. Louis Black Repertory Company, the Theater Project Company and other performing groups. The 1907 Medinah Temple building is to be renovated to provide rehearsal and education spaces. And the former Block Brothers Photography Studio on Grandel Square, which has the sturdy grandeur of an H. H. Richardson building, is being renovated to serve as a patrons' center.
The vivid history of the area is exemplified in the Sheldon, which was designed by Louis C. Spiering, one of the principal architects of the 1904 World's Fair. The classical Greek building was erected as the headquarters of the Ethical Society of St. Louis, as a memorial to Walter Sheldon, its founder and a music lover. Every acoustical detail was carefully worked out, with slightly less attention paid to the comfort of the audience, seated in wooden seats in an interior that resembles that of a spare-looking New England church. "What you lose in the gluteals you gain in the aurals," Walter Gunn, the Sheldon's director, said.
 
A Church in Hot Pink
 The building was put up for sale in the late 1970's, after the Ethical Society had moved away. One tenant, called St. Michael's Church of the Expanded Mind, stapled vinyl zebra skin to the seats and painted the church hot pink and white, with a huge rainbow over the proscenium proclaiming "Love Is the Answer." An impresario bought the building in 1984, and it was purchased this year by a foundation headed by Leigh Gerdine, former president of Webster University in St. Louis. The foundation has embarked on a $3.5 million campaign to pay off the mortgage, make improvements and establish the theater as a self-sustaining institution.
The Grandel Square Theater, the project's first new performance space, exemplifies the area's promise. Through dust and construction debris, it is possible to pick out its woodbeam arches, huge old marble and wood mantel and rosette window, and to envision the 450-seat theater and elegant cafe scheduled to be completed by September 1992.
There has been some criticism by local arts groups that fund raising and construction have been slow. But the St. Louis project is not likely to be faced with the public outcry that greeted the demolition of business and residential buildings to make way for Lincoln Center in the late 1950's.
 
Gentrification a Concern
 "We were worried about gentrification," Mr. Gaddes said. "Thom, in particular, has worked hard to build bridges." Grand Center has consulted local institutions like the Urban League and, in the area, the Third Baptist Church, St. Louis University and the Veterans' Hospital. New lighting installed by Grand Center in the Blumeyer public housing complex to the north inspired new tenant participation in stemming its decline. Circus Flora, a European-style circus with offices in the administration building, has trained neighborhood children to perform with the group.
"We've only acquired one property that required relocation," Mr. Digman said. "And we relocated them in the district. Everything else was abandoned, or a vacant lot." A residential building in the district has become the home of a violin maker and an organization for black artists. "We see a large part of our role as helping stabilize the neighborhood and these arts groups," Mr. Gaddes said.

Promotions and Packages
 Autumn is a time of big new packages and promotions, some of them in many parts and with high price tags. Next week, for example, Paramount begins to celebrate the 25th anniversary of "Star Trek" with tapes of the first three episodes of "Star Trek: The Next Generation," the television series. (Seventy-nine episodes of the original series are in circulation.) The price is $19.95 each. In addition, the five "Star Trek" feature films will be reissued in two different boxed sets. One will come in a slipcase and sell for $74.75; the other, with the five films in the letter-box format (bars across the top and bottom of the picture), will be sold in a cloth-bound box for $100. Individually, the five are still available at $14.95 each. 
 On Oct. 10, Paramount will present its "Godfather Collector's Edition" as well as "The Godfather Part III" alone. In the collector's package one gets "Part III" ( Francis Ford Coppola has added nine minutes to the original theatrical version), the first two "Godfather" films and a 73-minute documentary about the making of all three. The price will be $150 for the seven cassettes.
One may still rent "Part III" by itself, of course, and perhaps buy a copy for $15 or so during the used-cassette sale that often begins after the initial heavy-rental period of a month or more. Paramount is backing that promotion, too.
 
Helping the Blind
 "We hit the stores the same day as 'Dances With Wolves,' " said Robert Perrone, the assistant director of student training at the Braille Institute in Los Angeles. Yesterday the institute, which works with the blind and visually impaired, released its "Insight Series," five tapes of support and instruction for the afflicted and their families. "The blind population is increasing," said Mr. Perrone, who cited advancing age and the fact that cures for childhood illness sometimes impair sight. "The tapes are both educational and inspirational," Mr. Perrone said. "We provide direction."
The videos are introduced by Sidney Poitier, Charlton Heston and other Hollywood celebrities. "Bright Beginnings" instructs and encourages parents of preschool children; "Brighter Visions" addresses the elderly; "Touch and Go" examines the techniques of moving about outside the home; "Work Sight" talks about successful work experiences, and "Bridges to Independence" looks at the needs of blind or visually impaired teen-agers.
The videos, which are distributed by RCA/Columbia, are offered rent free at participating stores, or they can be bought for $25 each. Proceeds go the Braille Institute. Information: (800) 272-4553.
 
NEW VIDEO RELEASES
 
 
 
Dances With Wolves
1990. Orion. $99.98. 3 hours. Closed captioned. PG-13.
 During the Civil War a lone Union cavalry officer (Kevin Costner) rides west to the Dakota Territory and establishes personal ties with a tribe of Lakota Sioux. If Mr. Costner's film, which earned $180 million at the box office, has a weakness, it is that it sometimes takes itself a bit too seriously. Open spaces are grand, motives noble and scenes exciting, but at times the effort seems a bit too clean and admirable. Often the vistas seem more suited to a travelogue, and when the officer sticks a feather in his hair and struts around the village, "the movie teeters on the edge of Boy's Life literature, that is, on the brink of earnest silliness" (Vincent Canby).
 
La Femme Nikita
1991. Vidmark. $89.95. 1:57. French with English subtitles. R.
 A tough French street girl (Anne Parillaud) with a flair for killing is recruited by the Government to be an assassin. To perform the assignment she is made over into a wily, sleekly turned-out operative who somewhat incongruously falls in love with a supermarket clerk. Luc Besson's film is best appreciated for the high-gloss effectiveness of its pumped-up violence and sumptuous settings as well as "Miss Parillaud herself, a nimble and dangerous-looking actress with a fashion model's leggy cachet" (Janet Maslin).
 
Icicle Thief
1989. Fox Lorber. $79.95. 1:30. Italian with English subtitles. No rating.
 Maurizio Nichetti's film includes a film within a film and Mr. Nichetti playing two parts. In the first role he is the director of a movie called "The Icicle Thief," a black-and-white film with men on bicycles closely modeled after Vittorio de Sica's classic of nearly the same name. In the second role he is an unemployed father at home watching the movie, which is constantly interrupted by commercials. Rapid convolutions and role switches ensue in a story that sounds too contrived for its own good but that survives to "become an energetic and congenial farce" (Caryn James).
 
The Emperor's New Clothes and Other Folk Tales
Danny and the Dinosaur and Other Stories
1991. CC Studios. Two cassettes, $19.95 each. 30 minutes each.
 Seven tales for small children are accompanied by illustrations either from their books or commissioned for these tapes. Nadine Bernard Wescott's drawings, for example, turn out a splendiferous wardrobe for the emperor until swindlers produce the more basic outfit, and various provocative creatures gambol and ruminate in such tales as "Suho and the White Horse," "Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears" and "The Island of the Skog."
 
 
 
FRENCH THRILLERS

DIABOLIQUE -- His wife (Vera Clouzot) and his mistress (Simone Signoret) kill a domineering schoolteacher -- or think they have until the fellow apparently keeps turning up alive. 1955. Video Yesteryear and various distributors. $29.95. 1:47. Subtitles. No rating.
THE WAGES OF FEAR -- Yves Montand and three other desperate characters are on a bumpy road to nowhere with a very skittish truckload of nitroglycerin. 1955. Video Yesteryear and various distributors. $29.95. 2:11. Subtitles. No rating.

HEADLINE: A GARDENER'S WORLD;
Blue Rose? Why, of All Bloomin' Things?
Because of Its 'Mystery'

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER

 BODY:
GENETIC engineers in Australia say they have isolated the gene that controls the color blue -- and stuck it into the red red rose.
The quest, which has taken four years, is likened to the search for the Holy Grail by Michael Dalling, president of Calgene Pacific Proprietary Ltd., a genetic engineering concern in Melbourne. But the blue rose is still a test-tube baby. 
 "We've isolated the gene that controls the synthesis of the pigment delphinidum, which was originally extracted from blue delphinium, but we're taking it out of a blue petunia," Mr. Dalling said. "And now we have to insert this gene into a single cell of the rose plant, and get it to regenerate into a fully functioning plant: leaves, stem, buds, the whole thing."
After growing in the lab for a couple years, it will have to prove itself in the field, doing basic tasks like blooming and not losing its petals. Not to mention blooming a true blue, rather than those muddy blues and lavenders so many hybridizers have touted under the names of Blue Skies and Blue Girl and so forth.
Calgene's partner in this venture is Suntory Ltd., a Japanese conglomerate best known for its whisky. "A lot of liquor companies are interested in the uses of biotechnology in the fermentation process," Mr. Dalling said.
Rose growers in the United States compare the blue rose to the black orchid. You long for what you don't have. Until you get it.
"It's got a mystery to it," said Robert Griesbach, a geneticist for the United States Department of Agriculture. "Gardeners want them, but it's not a large constituency. On Valentine's Day, people are not going to buy blue roses."
But the Japanese will, Mr. Dalling insists, "because it's unique." And the Japanese are also ritualistic gift-givers. "It's important to their whole social being," he said, adding that giving a dozen of blue roses, which are expected to sell for almost $1,000, would "mean you thought very highly of someone."
And sure, men give women red roses on Valentine's Day to say, "I love you." "But why couldn't women say the same thing with blue roses?" Mr. Dalling said. (Like those sinuous women in the Bailey's Bristol Cream ads, who can invite men over for drinks without appearing macho.)
The rose, economically, is nothing to be sniffed at. "We consumed over a billion roses in this country last year," said Alvi Voight, an agricultural economist at Pennsylvania State University. And that added up to about $1.5 billion, he estimated.
But as for the blue rose, well, some experts are skeptical.
"I gave a snicker when I heard about it," said Michael Ruggiero, the rose curator for the New York Botanical Garden. "Hybridizers have come up with a lot of 'blue' roses, but they're lavender, not blue."
Mr. Ruggiero pulled out his catalogue from Interstate Nurseries in Missouri. "Blue Skies is supposed to have lobelia-blue buds," he said. "Here it is, in bold print: 'The Bluest Rose Ever.' But it looks lavender to me."
Although breeders are intrigued by Calgene's claim, they say that simply isolating a gene and inserting it into another plant is only one stage of a complex, little-understood game.
"Flower color is a very complex phenomenon," Mr. Griesbach said. "Most people on the street think that one pigment gives you one flower color, but that is simply not true."
Cyanidin is the pigment in the red rose, for example. But it's also the pigment in blue cornflowers.
"One of the modifying factors in flower color is pH," Mr. Griesbach said. "In red flowers, the pH is acidic; in blue flowers, it's alkaline. And there are other modifying factors like co-pigments and metals."
It's the interaction of all these compounds that makes a red rose or a blue rose, he said; there is no such thing as a blue gene or a red gene.
Calgene agrees that flower color is a complex process, but the company says its isolation of the gene is the key to the blue rose. "We're hoping to produce a whole range of colors," said Mr. Dalling said. "Pastel blue for the Japanese, and a deeper, darker blue for the Americans."
And the hybridizers will probably make sure that the petals don't fall off. And that the blue rose blooms in the first place.
"If Calgene creates a rose that expresses the color blue, more than likely it will not be a good variety," said Keith Zary, director of research for Jackson & Perkins, an Oregon rose company that has already talked to Calgene. "It may be disease-prone, or it may not flower enough. So we conventional breeders will cross the original to get better plants."
And Calgene has applied for a patent for the gene they isolated, he said. "So anybody who wants to use that gene will have to be licensed by the owner," Mr. Zary said. "And I'm sure it won't be cheap."
Genetic engineering could turn the garden into a new wild frontier.
"I think it's great," said Leonard Veasey, the rosarian at the American Rose Society in Louisianna. "I can't remember how long ago it was that there weren't any orange roses. And now I hear somebody's working on extracting a gene from marine plants that will make roses glow in the dark."
Mr. Ruggiero, the curator, calls it "spooky." The very idea. Mixing plant families. "I'd like to see them do a day lily with an oak tree," he said. "Imagine a 40-foot plant that bloomed for one day."

HEADLINE: In the Nation;
Big Tickets Revisited

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
The continuing collapse of the Soviet Union, despite Mikhail Gorbachev's effort to preserve its vestiges, raises hard questions about the U.S. Senate's decision to spend $10 billion reviving an anti-missile defense abandoned 20 years ago.
A defense against whom? The hard-liners in Moscow have been shown to be bumblers, rather than a threat to take power. If one of the dissident republics got control of an ICBM, it might more likely fire it at the Kremlin than the U.S. And whatever shreds of the former superpower that survive will need aid from the West, not war with it. 
 Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, a main sponsor of the ABM revival, cited "C.I.A. estimates that 15 to 20 third-world countries will have them [missiles] by the turn of the century."
"What 'them' is he talking about?" asked Sherman Frankel, a physics professor at the University of Pennsylvania, in a letter to the editor of The New York Times. "There is a huge difference between a Scud with a few hundred mile range, barely capable of reaching Israel from Iraq, and an ICBM that must travel thousands of miles . . . and be powerful enough to carry a nuclear weapon."
Mr. Frankel further argued that, if the threat is from accidental launches, defense efforts would be better focused on providing funds for deploying a "post-launch control system" to render harmless a mistaken or unauthorized missile firing. He is an authority on such a system.
In a letter to me, Sydney D. Drell, deputy director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, also questioned the threat: "Is it theatre missiles? Is it intercontinental range ballistic missiles from Third World countries? Very different technical challenges are presented by these radically different potential threats," including remaining Soviet ICBM's.
Mr. Drell pointed out, moreover, that "before embarking on new deployments or ABM Treaty modifications" (both required by the Senate plan), the U.S. "must seriously think through the arms control and security implications." But, he added: "Theatre defense against shorter range missiles can proceed sensibly without impact on the ABM Treaty."
Therefore, he suggested, the Senate had "put the cart before the horse" because "a strong R&D program emphasizing ground-based technology is what is called for."
On Aug. 1, in this space, an objection was registered to the anti-missile program as one of several unneeded "big ticket" items, including the Superconducting Supercollider. Mr. Frankel and Mr. Drell took vigorous exception to describing the supercollider as a useless "monstrosity" that would cost $11 billion better devoted to "smaller science programs."
"You simply have goofed," Mr. Frankel wrote me, and defended the device's high cost: "The last high energy accelerator built in this country is about 20 years old and it is unlikely that after the [supercollider] is built that there will be another step before about a quarter of a century. So the yearly cost is not so high."
Mr. Drell strongly defended "the importance, as well as the practicality" of the supercollider, which he termed "crucially important to our efforts to further our understanding of the basic forces and the elementary particles of nature and how they unify [Einstein's lifelong dream]."
The physics community, he wrote, had developed a "strong consensus" on the supercollider's "unique importance." Physicists' "very limited understanding of the origin of the masses of what we today call 'elementary particles' has given us confidence that there must be fundamental new phenomena to be discovered when we probe nature at the collision energies designed for the [supercollider]."
A third physicist's voice, that of Terrence L. Watts of Rutgers, suggested that the supercollider would be a "great place" with "excellent physics" for training students. It would, he contended, make "a good contribution to the education of scientists and to the strengths of our universities," rather than swallowing funds needed elsewhere.
All U.S. science, "not just the workers in small science," he insisted, suffer from "barely adequate funding" -- but not because of big-ticket items. Rather, the deficiency "is a general aspect of the excess military buildup of the recent decade and the reduction in growth of our economy."
Mr. Watts thinks he can help reverse economic decline "by training scientists at the [supercollider]." If he can, more power to him.

After the Fall

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
I've been out of touch for a few weeks; anything happen while I was on vacation?
No Rip Van Winkle could be more delighted: Communism is dead. The Soviet empire is breaking up. This is a glorious moment for human freedom. 
 We should savor that moment, thanking God, NATO, the heroic dissidents in Russia and the internal empire, and the two-generation sacrifice of the American people to protect themselves and the world from despotic domination.
We should seize the moment, too, to urge our new comrades in freedom to use counter-coup momentum to destroy the institutions and bring down the elite that oppressed them.
Mr. Gorbachev is still half-measuring: the K.G.B. chief has been arrested and some top brass demoted, while its troops are reassigned to the Defense Ministry and much fuss is made over the tearing down of the statue of Iron Feliks Dzerzhinsky.
But that means the secret police is intact, awaiting the moment for new leaders and a reassignment of assets to seize power. Free people need no secret police; the K.G.B.'s entire budget should be seized and used to buy food to help people get through the winter. Unpaid agents and bureaucrats will have an incentive -- hunger -- to go out into the fields and bring in the harvest.
And who needs a huge Red Army? Nobody is threatening Russia or the other republics. The soldiers proved their heroism by refusing to fire on the people; the Red Army can serve most honorably by demobilizatsiya on a vast scale, now.
Needed throughout the societies is a good witch hunt, not for Communist-style repression so universally tut-tutted but to ferret out the assets of the "new class" of corrupt officials and to force parasitic apparatchiks to do an honest day's work.
The shrinking center should sell the land and shares in the factories to the people (they'll do a land-office business), and turn over the natural resources to the republics, letting the profit motive of free enterprise -- not welfare handouts disguised as loan guarantees -- save the lands that Communism failed.
Why isn't the President of the United States on the air welcoming the Russians, Ukrainians and all to the free world, urging the dissolution of the police and cutbacks in the army, showing the path to prosperity?
Part of the answer: He does not want to make another foreign-affairs mistake. This spring Mr. Bush blundered grievously in the giveback of Iraq; this summer, in his dismaying "Chicken Kiev speech," he lectured Ukrainians against self-determination, foolishly placing Washington on the side of Moscow centralism and against the tide of history.
The rest of the answer is that Mr. Bush and his advisers have long feared the breakup of the empire that calls itself a union. The scare words are "disunion, dismemberment, disintegration." The fear is not irrational: tight central control of the Soviet nuclear command "football" is in our vital national interest. We are also rightly concerned about the local pogroms and border clashes that disunion may bring.
But the strategic advantage to an end to imperialism is compelling. With the Soviet monolith broken up and a commonwealth established to negotiate arms reductions, the world will be a far safer place.
The moral advantage to disunion is overlooked by diplomats hung up on tidiness. Personal freedom is often aligned with self-determination; diverse cultures that want to assert independence should have America's support, not finger-wagging at ethnic hatreds to conceal our preference for foreign central control.
The argument is moot; disunion is a fact. Democrats from Bill Bradley in Washington to Gary Hart in Moscow are spelling out serious responses, while Mr. Bush, in a policy paralysis he calls prudence, is barking "not so fast" from a golf cart.
Two and a half years ago, the first of the "Free the Baltics" columns appeared in this space. Those three small nations were the key to imperial disunion, and the Landsbergis stand against tanks in the Vilnius parliament led to the Yeltsin stand at the Russian parliament last week.
In a day or two, Mr. Bush is expected to follow the world in sending envoys to the Baltics. The freed pioneers of the breakup will then help the Soviet Economic Union get on its feet. These are great days.

HEADLINE: Delve Deeper Into C.I.A.-Bank Connection;
Pakistan Bias as Usual

 BODY:
Yo the Editor:
Recent anti-Semitic remarks by a Pakistani official made while defending the founder of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Business Day, Aug. 1) should be condemned by the world community. 
 The highest elected official in the Pakistani province of Sindh, Jam Sadiq Ali, stated that "B.C.C.I. was a third world bank, and it took to the challenge of breaking a hegemonistic control of the Jewish lobby on the world's financial institutions."
This is hardly the first time Pakistanis have spewed anti-Semitic canards and engaged in blatant discrimination. In the early 1980's the Pakistan-based World Muslim Congress sent anti-Semitic, Holocaust revisionist material to British members of Parliament and the United States Congress; in 1982 the Pakistani Government denied entry to a European Parliamentary Commission seeking to meet with Afghan refugees on the grounds it was headed by a Jew; in 1983 Pakistan's information minister said "the international media are surely and securely in the hands of the Jews."
Only last year the Pakistani film "International Guerrillas," which depicted Salman Rushdie as a decadent and evil leader of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy against Islam, played to record audiences across Pakistan.
Once again, a Pakistani has scapegoated the Jews for the nefarious activities of others. That such canards continue to emanate from Government officials is all the more outrageous.

HEADLINE: Lessons in Ignorance Breed Prejudice

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your front-page article "Afrocentrism: Balancing or Skewing History?" (Aug. 11) brought back painful memories of a particular lesson I remember from my sixth-grade geography book. 
 This was 1953-54, and the book was my school's authorized text from which the students learned about the world. My sister was a year behind me, and she too remembers this lesson about Africa: the text described how many, many years ago, when a great fire had swept the plains of Africa, the natives escaped from it by jumping feet-first into holes in the ground.
Because the holes were not very deep, when the fire crossed over the hideouts of the Africans, the heat singed their hair. And that, according to this text, was why Africans had kinky hair.
Reading that passage brought terrible visions of flames and horror to my mind. For a brief time after that I even believed that, unlike my classmates whose hair was straight, that really was why my hair was kinky.
Racial tensions have increased in the United States, as well as in countries like France, Germany and Britain. The lack of understanding or knowing about others who are red or black or brown or yellow or white rips at the fabric of humanity.
Count the times that you have heard people say, "They should go back where they came from." It is a statement that is born of fear and fed by ignorance.
Other times the statement is economic: to improve their quality of living, immigrants often work two and three jobs -- jobs Americans refuse -- only to be hated by their neighbors when they buy a house or a car. As people migrate from one continent to another, America loses its place as the melting pot. Earth is the melting pot.
Scholars will probably never agree on the absolute history of other colors, but by debating it in public we can hope that they will find the best way to teach it.

Disney Theme Parks Get a New President

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
Judson C. Green has been named president of Walt Disney Attractions, assuming responsibility for running the company's theme parks in California, Florida and Europe.
Mr. Green, previously senior vice president and chief financial officer of the parent, the Walt Disney Company, succeeds Richard A. Nunis, who has been promoted to chairman of Walt Disney Attractions. 
 The changes come at a difficult time in the theme park business because the recession has reduced attendance. "It's been a horrendous year for discretionary travel in general, and more specifically for relatively high-ticket items such as trips to Disney World in Florida," said Harold Vogel, who follows Disney for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
At Disney World, for example, which also faces competition from the new Universal Studio Tour in Orlando, Mr. Vogel estimated that attendence in the quarter ending Sept. 30 would be down about 14 percent.
Although "it is a hard time for anyone involved in the hospitality industry," Mr. Green said in an interview, "we have our sights on the long term and we won't stop pursuing those plans."
Mr. Green, who will be based in Burbank, Calif., said he expected to spend about half his time overseas for a while in preparation for the opening of Euro Disney, near Paris, in April 1992.
Mr. Green, 39 years old, joined Disney in 1981 and has served in positions that include vice president for finance and planning for the Walt Disney World Resorts before becoming chief financial officer in 1989.
"This promotion would suggest that Judson is being groomed for higher positions, since he is getting exposure to both the financial and operating sides of the business," said Harold Vogel, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
Ever since joining the company in 1955, Mr. Nunis, 59, has worked in the theme parks division, holding such positions as director of park operations and vice president for operations before becoming president of Walt Disney Attractions in 1980.
Mr. Green attended Depauw University and received a master's degree in business administration from the Universtiy of Chicago in 1976. He and his wife, Joyce, have two children.

HEADLINE: New York State Weighs Canceling A Huge Canadian Power Contract

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
The future of a giant hydroelectric construction project in northern Quebec, already under siege from environmentalists, faces a new threat: a move by New York State to back away from a $17 billion, 21-year contract to buy power.
On Tuesday night, the New York Power Authority said it had reached an agreement with Hydro-Quebec to delay until Nov. 30, 1992, a decision on whether to buy one million kilowatts of hydroelectricity from the Canadian utility. The New York authority had originally said it would decide by the end of this year and, if it agreed to the sale, begin buying the power in 1995. 
 It said on Tuesday that it was reconsidering the Canadian deal because conservation efforts, among other factors, had improved the state's energy outlook since 1989, when the original agreement was reached. The Power Authority, a state agency that resells electricity to utilities at no profit, has been Hydro-Quebec's largest customer outside of Canada. It supplies about a quarter of the state's electricity.
If the authority decides against going ahead with the contract, Hydro-Quebec would be likely to delay its sprawling Great Whale hydroelectric project near James Bay, utility officials and environmentalists say.
If the contract is ratified, the Power Authority would buy one million kilowatts year-round, enough for one million households at any given moment. It would sell about 80 percent of the power to three utilities in the New York metropolitan area: Consolidated Edison, the Long Island Lighting Company and Orange and Rockland Utilities.
Con Edison, which serves New York City, would buy almost half of the Canadian power for $6.1 billion over 21 years. If the contract falls through, the utilities would have to find additional power through further conservation or from greater reliance on independent power producers.
The Great Whale project, 650 miles north of Montreal, is at the heart of Hydro-Quebec's plans to expand its northern Quebec operations, already among the world's largest sources of hydroelectric power.
Environmentalists as well as the people in the region, chiefly the Cree Indians and the Inuit, have fought to stop the project. They say the utility's plan to dam the Great Whale River to generate the power, thereby flooding hundreds of square miles, would doom the hunting, trapping and fishing that have defined a way of life there.
Environmentalists say that if New York cancels its agreement, the Great Whale project could be delayed for many years. The utility, which is owned by the province of Quebec, agrees there would be a delay but says it would be for only two or three years.
Lining up big export customers like New York State is an important step if Hydro-Quebec is to obtain financing from Wall Street investors for the James Bay expansion, which the utility says is necessary to meet Quebec's growing energy demand.
 
Second Thoughts
 The Power Authority's move to extend the deadline for a decision suggests that it is having second thoughts about the economics of the deal. In 1984, hydroelectric power from Hydro-Quebec met 8.8 percent of New York State's needs. But the total has dropped substantially in the last few years because of low water levels in Quebec.
"These are signs that the deal is beginning to unravel," said State Senator Franz S. Leichter, Democrat of Manhattan, who has been a leading political opponent to the contract.
In an interview, the authority's chairman, Richard M. Flynn, denied that the authority was smoothing the way for a contract cancellation. Instead, he said, the 11-month delay would be spent reviewing the cheapest ways to provide power to the state as well as the environmental costs of dependence on fossil fuels like oil.
A draft of a New York State energy plan released this month found that a new contract with Hydro-Quebec could raise electricity rates slightly for New Yorkers. But it also noted that alternative power sources like oil- and coal-fueled plants could increase air pollution in parts of the state where pollution levels already exceed Federal standards.
Mr. Flynn said the authority could decide to go ahead with the Hydro-Quebec contract but negotiate for a lower price or delay its 1995 starting date.
In a statement Tuesday night, Mr. Flynn said that since 1989, when the tentative contract was signed, projections of the state's energy needs had changed because of progress in utility conservation programs and an increasing use of independent suppliers.
"Now it's appropriate to re-evaluate the contract in light of these changed conditions," Mr. Flynn said.
 
Cuomo Says Option Open
 In recent weeks, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has said in meetings with opponents of the contract that cancellation remained an option, said Frank Murray Jr., a spokesman for the Governor. But the state has yet to conclude that the Canadian power is uneconomical, he said. The Power Authority chairman is appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the State Senate.
A spokesman for Hydro-Quebec said he did not know what the Power Authority would conclude.
"Frankly, I don't know. Every option is open," said the spokesman, Pierre Bolduc, executive vice president for external markets, in a telephone interview from Montreal. "We are aware that there are second thoughts about the contract in New York."
Mr. Bolduc said Great Whale would be built with or without the New York State contract because the Quebec economy would eventually require the power. He said the loss of the contract would probably delay the project's start-up, but only for perhaps two years, from 1998 or 1999 to 2000 or 2001.
 
Big Setback Seen
 But people who have followed Hydro-Quebec's strategy say cancellation of the New York contract would be a major blow to the utility.
"If New York pulls out, then Hydro-Quebec has to go back to the drawing board," said Jan Beyea, chief scientist for the National Audubon Society, which has been fighting the Great Whale project for five years.
The society and other environmental groups have apparently been heard. Assemblyman William B. Hoyt, a Democrat of Buffalo and a leading opponent, said that a "ferocious environmental movement" had arisen in the last year in New York State and that the Power Authority's decision shows that Governor Cuomo "doesn't want to be painted into a corner" on the issue.
This month, Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York wrote to the Power Authority chairman, Mr. Flynn, asking the agency to further study the economic value of the new hydropower.
Hydro-Quebec's plan has also created a jurisdictional dispute in Canada; the province of Quebec is battling the Federal Government in Ottawa over who has final say on environmental review.
James A. Dumont, a lawyer for several environmental groups as well as the Cree Indians, compared the fight against the new hydroelectric power to the long battle against nuclear energy, in which construction of many nuclear plants has been too costly to continue.
"We may not have convinced the skeptics about the environmental problems," he said, "but for financial reasons the contracts will die."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Urgent Question On Aid to Soviets

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
AS the Soviet Union struggles on the brink of economic collapse and political dissolution, the urgent question facing the United States and its partners in the Group of Seven industrialized countries is what posture to take on foreign aid to the nation and its seceding republics.
President Bush is still holding to the cautious approach to Soviet aid that Western leaders agreed to during the London economic summit conference in July. In the midst of the incredible events that began 10 days ago with the attempted coup against President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, President Bush said he had "seen nothing to make me change my mind" about the group's agreement not to give Moscow direct financial aid until more fundamental steps are taken to establish a market economy. The Western leaders also agreed to offer the Soviet Union only technical assistance and associate membership in the International Monetary Fund. 
 These 10 days have been the obverse of the "10 days that shook the world" during the Russian Revolution in November 1917, and have reversed that revolution. Yet, the Bush Administration is holding firm, waiting for the dust to settle. Prime Minister John Major of Britain, visiting Mr. Bush at Kennebunkport, Me., said he sided with Mr. Bush on the aid issue. But the leaders of Germany, France and Italy are calling for a big package of money to help speed Soviet economic reform and recovery.
Some Congressional leaders are also pressing Mr. Bush for a more forthcoming response to the Soviet crisis. Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, proposed this week to cut $1 billion from weapons spending to provide humanitarian aid, declaring, "We do not want the first winter of freedom after 70 years of Communism to be a disaster for the Soviet Union." Mr. Bush told reporters on Wednesday that he had not yet considered the question of food aid but added, "We want to do our part on that." The Group of Seven yesterday pledged urgent help to prevent famine this winter but held to its cautious line on other aid for the sinking Soviet economy.
The question of providing long-term aid to help rescue that economy is far more difficult. Prof. Abram Bergson, a distinguished Sovietologist at the Russian Research Center of Harvard University, said in an interview, "The situation is too fluid to permit the construction of meaningful plans for long-term aid." But he favors immediate aid with food, medicine and spare parts for factories.
The Soviet gross national product dropped 10 percent in the first six months of this year, and before the attempted coup, the Soviet Statistical Office predicted that G.N.P. would fall 6 percent further before the end of the year.
"The disorder of the coup is likely to compound the decline, rather than offset it," Professor Bergson said. Hunger looms, he warned, not only because of falling farm production but also because of the broken-down distribution system. He characterized the Bush Administration as being "prudent to the point of stultification."
And Robert D. Hormats, a former Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs who is vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International, urged the United States and other Western countries to do more to reward the democratic forces in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe by opening Western markets wider to their exports. He said a successful completion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations would help the East greatly by liberalizing trade in agriculture, textiles and other manufactured goods.
The economic problems in Eastern Europe have been aggravated by the splitting up of the Comecon trade bloc -- and the inability of the ex-Communist countries to export to the West. A breakup of the Soviet Union into separate republics, with no center to hold their economies together, could have like effects.
None of the republics, Mr. Hormats said, have yet developed economic plans. Yesterday, Russia and the Ukraine, the two most populous republics, agreed to form a temporary economic and military alliance and invited other "former subjects of the U.S.S.R." to join them.
But if such efforts at sustaining integration fail and the economy collapses, there could be devastating political consequences -- even civil war.
Hard-pressed on every side, Mr. Gorbachev is struggling to hold the Soviet Union together. Some may see parallels to the American Civil War -- in the issues of saving the union, preserving economic strength and winning the struggle for freedom.
But there are vast differences, too: Mr. Gorbachev is no Lincoln; he is unsure of his direction, and as he made clear when he returned to Moscow from the Crimea after the coup, he was still trying to save the Communist Party and the Marxist-Leninist revolution. He speaks in the name of political and economic freedom, but the republics oppose him, demanding their own freedom.
Still, there are opportunities as well as hazards for the West in this tumultuous and complex situation. The possibility of helping rescue the Soviet Union and its constituent republics from economic collapse and of achieving democracy, arms reductions and a secure peace are of vital importance to the world.
A safe transition from Communism to democracy and economic freedom could be the greatest benefit of the end of the cold war. For the United States, it would save the "peace dividend" and help provide the budgetary relief, savings and investment capital needed to establish the basis for stronger and more stable economic growth, both at home and abroad.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains After Report That Fed Won't Cut Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar edged higher against most leading currencies yesterday, bolstered by reports that the Federal Reserve would not immediately lower interest rates.
Currency analysts said the dollar initially fell in response to two reports that underscored the economy's weakness. The Government reported that in July, Americans' incomes fell for the first time in six months and new-home sales slumped 8.5 percent. 
 But markets bounced off opening lows after the central bank denied a rumor circulating in Europe that it was preparing to ease interest rates.
There had been speculation in recent weeks that the Fed was moving toward lower rates amid growing evidence of an anemic economic recovery. Lower interest rates, while considered good for economic growth, can hurt the dollar because they decrease the value of dollar-denominated investments.
 
Purchase Seen in Switzerland
 Also increasing demand were reports of a large dollar purchase by a currency fund manager out of Switzerland, said Robert Hatcher, a corporate dealer for Barclays Bank P.L.C. in New York.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 136.73 yen, down 0.40 yen from Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 136.95 yen, and in New York, it finished at 137.15, up from late Wednesday's 136.55.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.6805, compared with $1.6900 late Wednesday. In New York, the pound settled at $1.6835, down from late Wednesday's $1.6900.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's prices, included: 1.7440 German marks, up from 1.7395; 1.5240 Swiss francs, up from 1.5171; 5.9195 French francs, up from 5.9025; 1,301.50 Italian lire, up from 1,297.50, and 1.14045 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14075.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Precious Metal Prices Drop On Fears of Soviet Selloff

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Silver futures prices fell to six-month lows yesterday and other precious metals also dropped on fears that political upheaval in the Soviet Union could cause a huge selloff of gold.
On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for September delivery was $3 lower, at $350.90 an ounce, and September silver was 10.1 cents lower, at $3.82 an ounce. 
 Traders were reluctant to hold positions in gold amid speculation that independence-minded Soviet republics could seize stores of gold and sell large amounts to raise cash to aid their crumbling economies.
"There's plenty of Soviet jitters on the market right now," said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch Futures in New York. "The market seems to be highly fearful that there could be sales from other" Soviet states.
The leader of the Russian federation, Boris Yeltsin, reversed his position yesterday and agreed to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's request that gold be handled by a central Soviet agency, but that did little to calm the market fears, Mr. O'Neill said.
Investors also fear the Soviet Union could default on loans held by big Swiss banks, and they in turn could sell the gold they hold as collateral, he said.
Silver followed gold lower, slipping to six-month lows on most contracts. Prices also fell on word of significant selling in the Middle East and selling before the end of the near-term contract. The December silver contract fell to $3.89 an ounce, a level not seen since Feb. 28.
Yet, Peter Cardillo, the director of research at Westfalia Investments Inc. in New York, said the demand for both gold and silver remains fairly strong, and the market fell for technical reasons.
Energy futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange gained on word of a minor disruption of output in the North Sea.
October crude was 23 cents higher, at $21.97 a barrel; September heating oil was 0.95 cent higher, at 63.19 cents a gallon; September unleaded gasoline was 0.62 cent higher, at 65.96 cents a gallon, and October natural gas was 0.07 cents higher, at $1.571 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Grains and soybeans futures prices ended mostly lower on the Chicago Board of Trade on prospects of widespread thundershowers helping parched crops. Prices also were under pressure because of the lack of solid developments in the Soviet Union's credit situation.
September wheat futures settled 3/4 cent lower, at $3.04 1/2 a bushel; September corn settled 3 cents lower, at $2.47 a bushel; September oats were 1 1/4 cents lower, at $1.21 1/2 a bushel; September soybeans were 2 cents lower, at $5.68 1/2 a bushel.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle prices slipped after gaining early in the session on word that twice the normal number of cattle transactions had not cleared. Pork futures were mixed.
October cattle were 0.25 cent lower, at 69.70 cents a pound; August feeder cattle were 0.10 cent higher, at 87.25 cents a pound; October hogs were 0.18 cent lower, at 43.77 cents a pound; February pork bellies were 0.18 cent lower, at 47.62 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
Remarks by Bush and Briton: Unity on Reforms Reaffirmed

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 29

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a news conference today by President Bush and Prime Minister John Major of Britain:

 	 	 		OPENING STATEMENTS	 	 	 	 		President Bush	 	We stand united, as do other Western partners, in our commitment to help Soviet reform. The industrial democracies have already undertaken steps to aid the economic process. . . . But we must remember that the Soviet Union is undergoing a major political change. 
 And the Prime Minister and I also had a discussion about the Baltics. The U.S. is a strong supporter of Baltic independence. We've so notified the Soviet Union, and we've urged the Soviet leadership not to stand against the will of the inevitable, the winds of this inevitable change. The Baltics want freedom; clearly the United States and the U.K. want them to have freedom, and clearly the Baltics will have freedom. . . .
 
Prime Minister Major

. . . We certainly agree absolutely on our objectives in responding to the collapse of Communism in the Soviet Union. We need to support democracy; we need to encourage the economic reform that they so badly need in the Soviet Union, and we need also to respond compassionately to the urgent needs that the Soviet people have at the present time.
We will go on talking to the Soviet authorities, the central authorities, and also building on the existing relationships and the developing relationships with the new leaders in the republics. We're already in touch with the leaders of the Baltic states, and I hope, when I visit Moscow on Sunday, that I will be able to meet some if not all of them, as well as Presidents Gorbachev and Yeltsin and some of the other key figures. . . .
We agreed this morning on the principles governing aid to the Soviet Union. There is a window of opportunity at present for the speeding up of the economic reform process, and that is absolutely vital for the Soviet Union. The need to speed that is urgent, and we agreed this morning that we need to support the effort.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Our judgment is that what the Soviet Union and the republics most need is emergency humanitarian assistance, practical help in converting their economy into one that works. And that means that aid must be linked to a clear and comprehensive and practical reform plan, that it must go to those people who are in need, including directly to the individual republics, and that it needs to be linked to the Soviet commitment to further reduce defense spending.
And we were able to identify in our discussions this morning six particular points worthy of action.
The first is to implement existing food credits. The second is to assess the need for food aid during this winter. The third is to produce lifeline teams, teams to travel to the Soviet Union to help achieve efficient food production and food distribution; that may well be a public-private partnership, and it's an area where we and the United States will be moving ahead in the days and weeks. . . .
We agreed also we needed to implement the knowhow programs and the technical assistance that we discussed at the G-7 and the bilateral agreements we already have to assist the Soviets on that front. We also felt that the time was right to get the [International Monetary Fund] and the World Bank involved urgently in helping to work out practical structural reform plans and technical assistance for the Soviet Union.
And, sixth, we agreed that it would be right to accelerate implementation of special association for the Soviet Union with the IMF, with a view to full membership in due course for those who qualify, and by qualify I mean as well in terms of effective reform plans.

 	 	 		QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS	 	
 
The Pace of Change
 Q. The Supreme Soviet has been meeting most of this week. . . . Yet things seem about as confused today as they did 48 or 72 hours ago. Are things moving a little bit too slowly on that front for you or do you see things falling into place?
BUSH: No, I think the changes are so monumental that it is going to take time to sort it all out with finality. Every day there are new announcements of some new dramatic step taking place. So that's for them to sort out. We can't affect it particularly. I think the Prime Minister is right on target when he says we want to help; we're not just bystanders. We have a tremendous stake in what's taking place. But no, these changes have moved with such rapidity that -- well, put it this way: if two weeks ago somebody had predicted this, everybody would have said he had lost it.
. . . All the cards are not on the table when it comes to what the United States role should be or the U.K. role in further assistance of one kind or another. . . . We are watching. . . . learning. And we stand ready to be of assistance because what's at stake here is democracy and freedom. . . .
 
Western Policies
 Q. Most of the measures that you say you've discussed today involve speeding up things that were already in train. Do you not have any sense that given the momentous changes that we have seen in the Soviet Union, some more fundamental reconsideration of Western policy might be necessary?
MAJOR: We identified some time ago what was most practical and of most assistance to the Soviets. That hasn't changed. The dimensions of that have changed. The need, the speed for it has changed. Perhaps the volume of it has changed. What we've actually done this morning is agree a very practical way forward. People are suggesting all sorts of things that ought to be done, but the priorities are to deal with the problems of food and food distribution, to deal with the ways in which we can help the Soviets maximize their own capacity to produce both food and other mechanistic and hardware produce, and we need a good deal of information in order to do that. There's no point in going beyond that until we can see precisely what the need is. . . .
 
Nuclear Safety
 Q. Does the breakup of the Soviet empire raise any concerns . . . about who controls the Soviet nuclear arsenal? . . .
BUSH. I want to have it disposed of in a way that nuclear weapons safety is totally guaranteed and to date, we feel very comfortable about that . . . I want to reassure the American people that at no time has there been any . . . official concern about inadvertent use of . . . nuclear weapons, or something going awry. But that is a matter that needs to be sorted out, and I'm confident that everybody in the republics and everybody in the center understands that the last thing that the world needs is some kind of nuclear scare, to say nothing of a nuclear confrontation. . . . We feel comfortable now that whoever is in charge will do the right thing in terms of safeguarding these nuclear weapons. . . .

 	 	 		. ..	 	Q.: Les Aspin has recommended . . . to Congress that they take $1 billion out of the defense budget and put it into some kind of Soviet aid program. What do you think? . . .
BUSH.: . . . It's ironic that just a few, few days ago when this coup was under way, there started a debate about are we spending enough on defense. . . . Now the debate comes, well, maybe we've got too much in defense. I'd say let's take a little time and sort this thing out intelligently. . . . Right now I simply cannot endorse that and I notice so many people are jumping up and saying what we must do now is cut defense spending more. I think we've cut defense spending a lot and I want to be sure that our forces are properly structured to meet the needs that we were talking about just 12 months ago, standing in this very same place. . . .
 
Suspending the Party
 Q. The Supreme Soviet just announced within the past half hour that they are suspending the Communist Party through the Soviet Union. . . . How do you assess it?
BUSH. . . . I frankly rejoice in that. I don't see anything but good news in that for terms of the West and certainly in terms of America. The demise, the fall, of a totalitarian nondemocratic party effort -- I think that's a good thing. So I don't see any bad news in that at all. Rejoice, cheer.

Following is the text of a communique released early today by leaders of the Ukrainian and Russian republics, as translated by The Associated Press:
As a result of the liquidation of the state coup in the U.S.S.R., a new political situation has arisen, opening the possibility of accelerating democratic transformations and realizing the sovereign rights of republics to the fullest extent. 
 Taking into account the fact of the resignation of the U.S.S.R. Cabinet of Ministers and the inability of Union state structures to provide for the vital interests of the peoples, recognizing the inalienable right of the Ukraine and the Russian Federation to have state independence and confirming their adherence to the treaty between the R.S.F.S.R. and the Ukraine on Nov. 19, 1990, the sides agreed to the following:
1. To undertake joint actions with the goal of preventing the uncontrolled disintegration of the Union state, bearing in mind that during the transitional period, in order to support the systems providing vital necessities for the population and the functioning of the economy, it is expedient to create temporary interstate structures with the participation of interested states-subjects of the former U.S.S.R., regardless of their current status, on a representative and equal basis.
2. To propose to the states-subjects of the former U.S.S.R., regardless of their present status, that they immediately start preparations and signing of an economic agreement between them.
3. To confirm the special significance of military-strategic problems, to consider it necessary to implement a reform of the Armed Forces of the U.S.S.R. and to create a system of collective security, not to adopt unilateral decisions on military-strategic issues.
4. During the transitional period to avoid steps that affect the mutual interests of the sides without preliminary consultations.
5. To confirm articles 2 and 6, set out in the bilateral treaty of Nov. 19, 1990, on the rights of the citizens and the territorial integrity of the sides.
6. To emphasize the resolve to continue democratic transformations and to pursue a coordinated policy of radical economic reforms together with other states-subjects of the former Union.
7. To confirm the adherence to commitments by the U.S.S.R. in international relations, including agreements on arms reduction and arms control and responsibility for supporting international peace and stability, to express readiness to solve in the transitional period all the problems stemming from the previously adopted international commitments, on the basis of talks with both states-subjects of the former Union and members of the international community.
8. Immediately to exchange plenipotentiary representatives of the Russian federated republic and the Ukraine for continuous consultations.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Fell 8.5% in July

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Sales of new single-family homes fell sharply and unexpectedly in July, the Commerce Department said today, in a troubling sign that consumers lack confidence in the economic recovery.
Sales plunged 8.5 percent from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 472,000 homes, distressing some analysts, who had expected sales to jump to 530,000 units. In June, new-home sales had surged 7.4 percent. 
 In a second report that raised concern about whether the economy would successfully pull itself out of the first recession in eight years, the department said that the incomes of Americans fell in July for the first time in six months, edging down one-tenth of 1 percent. The drop was accompanied by an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent in consumer spending, suggesting people had been dipping into their savings. [Page D8.]
Both reports helped push prices of Treasury bonds up and yields down as traders bet that the new signs of weakness would encourage the Federal Reserve to give the economy a lift by easing interest rates. Concerns about the economy also contributed to a dip in stock prices, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 5.59 points yesterday from its record-high close on Wednesday. [Pages D14 and D8.]
 
Only Northeast Shows a Gain
 Declines in home sales were reported in all areas of the country, except the Northeast, which had the most extreme sales slump last year.
In addition, the June sales figure was revised downward to an increase of 4 percent from the 7.4 percent rise that the department originally estimated.
Tom Holloway, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association, called the sales report disturbing because it suggested the steam was going out of the housing sector, which had been leading the economy out of recession.
"All in all, this is a very distressing report," Mr. Holloway said. "It's discouraging for housing, and it's discouraging for the overall economy.
"The economic recovery is pretty flimsy anyway," he added, "and the one sector that had been giving it support was housing."
Dave Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said the latest sales figures point to trouble for the economy, when considered alongside surveys from builders that show buyer interest has weakened in August.
"This is really shaky," Mr. Seiders said. "The Fed has to be alarmed."
The Federal Reserve Board, the nation's central bank, sets interest-rate strategy and can lower rates to try to encourage more borrowing and spending by businesses and consumers.
 
Midwest Sales Off 27.4%
 The falloff in new-home sales last month was widespread, with the biggest plunge coming in the Midwest, where sales fell 27.4 percent to 69,000 units.
Throughout the recession, the Midwest has been one of the most stable regions of the country, so industry analysts singled out the big July drop as a special cause for concern.
Mr. Holloway did note that the magnitude of the fall in the Midwest affected the overall report, and next month's revisions might make the picture less gloomy. He also noted that average interest rates on 30-year mortgages had fallen to around 9 percent from 9.58 percent in July, which should prompt some revival in buying interest.
But, he said, better growth in jobs and in consumer income would be required over the long term to sustain rising home sales.
Mr. Seiders said reports from builders in the Midwest showed that demand for new homes remained weak all through July and into August.
In the South, sales fell 8.2 percent in July, to 191,000 units. They were down 4 percent in the West, to 144,000 units.
In the Northeast, sales were up 6.3 percent, to 67,000 units.
Nationally, new-home sales in July were a steep 12.7 percent lower than in July 1990, when they were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 541,000.
The median price of a new home in July was $120,200, a gain of 1.3 percent from a year earlier.
The national economy's recovery seems weak, and the housing figures partly reflect a lack of consumer confidence and difficulty for potential buyers in finding job opportunities, Mr. Seiders said. "The Fed has to move quickly," he added.
The overall weakness in home sales -- an important measure of consumers' willingness to make long-term financial commitments -- was underlined by a report earlier this week that showed a parallel 6.7 percent drop in July sales of existing homes.
In that report, the steepest regional decline was in the South, where existing-home sales dropped by 14.8 percent, to 1.27 million units. The Northeast, however, posted its fourth consecutive monthly increase, 1.8 percent, to 580,000 units.

HEADLINE: Dip in Personal Incomes Is First in 6 Months

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Americans' incomes fell in July for the first time in six months, the Government said today in a report underscoring the economy's fragility.
Personal incomes edged down 0.1 percent, or $5.6 billion, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.81 trillion. That broke a string of five monthly advances, the Commerce Department said. 
 The drop, even though it was small and accompanied by a 0.4 percent increase in consumer spending, raised concern about whether the economy would successfully pull itself out of the first recession in eight years.
"It's like a bicycle," said Robert G. Dederick, an economist with the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "If you don't have enough forward momentum, you fall off."
 
No 'Jump Start' Seen Soon
 Consumer spending, representing two-thirds of the gross national product, is considered the key to any sustained economic revival.
"Consumers are not going to give the recovery the jump start it needs any time soon," said John M. Albertine, a Washington-based economic consultant. "In past recoveries, consumers have led the way. But today it appears that they have grown conservative."
Despite the income drop, consumer spending rose 0.4 percent in July after hefty gains of 0.7 percent in June and 0.8 percent in May. Spending rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $16.5 billion to $3.84 trillion.
The income and spending figures were not adjusted for inflation. But adjusting creates no real change because inflation was low in July. Adjusted disposable income fell the same 0.1 percent and consumer spending rose the same 0.4 percent.
Because income was so sluggish, consumers in effect maintained their living standards by dipping into their savings. The personal savings rate was 3.7 percent last month, down from 4.1 percent in June.
Disposable income -- income after taxes -- was unchanged from June to July after rising 0.6 percent in June.
Wages and salaries, which are key components of the income data, fell 0.3 percent in July, even more than income generally. According to Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, a Washington consulting firm, the wage-and-salary data reflect employers' caution about expanding payrolls.
"Employers are still laying off and they're very, very reluctant to start hiring again," she said. "There has to be an improvement in the job market and wages and salaries before consumers start to spend again."
 
Auto Sales Lifted Spending Data
 On the spending side, much of the strength came from a July increase in automobile sales, which have been falling this month. Spending for durable goods -- big-ticket items that include autos -- rose 1.8 percent. Spending on nondurable goods like food and clothing rose 0.2 percent, and spending on services increased 0.3 percent.
Ms. Shaber contended that a reluctance by banks to finance consumers' major purchases was restraining spending. But a survey of senior bank officers released today by the Federal Reserve found "little indication that banks had changed their willingness to provide consumer credit."
The survey, taken Aug. 9-13, did indicate, however, that banks continued to tighten their criteria for commercial real estate loans. They also were slightly stricter on home mortgage loans and business loans, the survey said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Continue to Rally

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The rally in the credit markets continued yesterday, as a fresh series of weak economic reports helped to push Treasury bond prices up and interest rates down.
The increasing signs of a limp recovery from the recession is likely to put more pressure on the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates further to stimulate economic activity. 
 Traders said they focused on a Government report showing an 8.5 percent slump in new home sales in July and a sharp downward revision in the number sold during June.
And they said a Commerce Department report showing that personal income fell by a tenth of 1 percent last month raised concerns about whether consumers have the wherewithal to bolster what already seems to be a tepid recovery.
 
New Jobless Claims Fall
 By contrast, traders shrugged off a report from the Labor Department that showed that initial unemployment claims fell by 9,000 during the week ended Aug. 17, to a seasonally adjusted 421,000. The decline in initial claims was larger than expected by many economists and followed two straight weeks of increases.
The housing statistics were consistent with a report earlier this week that sales of existing homes fell by 6.7 percent during July.
Nevertheless, "we were disappointed" with yesterday's numbers, said Michael Carliner, an economist at the National Association of Homebuilders. He said recent surveys of builders showed that "fewer people are coming around to look at homes."
"I think we will see some positive impact from the drop in mortgage rates we have seen over the last month or so," he said. "But we need to have them fall further. These numbers are further evidence that the recovery is very fragile and pathetic."
 
'No Momentum Building'
 The slump in home sales was considered especially disappointing because housing, along with exports, had been one of the more promising spots for an economic rebound.
But recent statistics seem to show that the economy is taking "one step forward, but then two steps back," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon National Bank in Pittsburgh.
"There is no momentum building" in the recovery, he said.
The numbers "reinforce the impression that the Fed will cut the funds rate and the discount rate," he said. "But one wonders whether monetary policy will be able to turn the economy around."
Rumors that the Federal Reserve Board governors were meeting yesterday to lower the discount rate, currently at 5.5 percent, circulated through the market yesterday. The Fed denied the reports.
All of these events were seen as good news by credit market participants, who continued to bid up prices of fixed-income securities.
In the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 101 12/32 late yesterday, up 18/32, to yield 8.00 percent, compared with 8.05 percent late Wednesday.
Among note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at 100 28/32, up 12/32, to yield 7.75 percent.
 
Gains for the New Notes
 The new two-year and five-year notes auctioned earlier this week continued to fare well. By late yesterday, the 6 3/8 percent two-year notes traded at a price of 100 6/32, up 1/32, for a yield of 6.27, down from 6.29 percent late Wednesday. Meanwhile, the 7 1/4 percent five-year notes traded at par late Thursday, up 8/32, to yield 7.25 percent, down from 7.31 percent late Wednesday.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were virtually unchanged in light trading. Three-month bills were offered at a rate of 5.30 percent, unchanged from the previous day, and the six-month bill rate was also unchanged at a rate of 5.32 percent in late trading.
The Treasury also sold $5 billion worth of 16-day cash management bills yesterday at an average discount rate of 5.38 percent.
 
Money Supply Increases
 In other developments, the Fed reported that its measure of the money supply known as M-2 rose $3.7 billion, to $3,387.4 billion, for the week ending Aug. 23. The Fed said the four-week moving average of M-2 was $3,385.6 billion. The broader measure known as M-3 rose $3.9 billion, to $4,146.2 billion. And the narrower measure known as M-1 rose $2.1 billion, to $864.9 billion.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said the prices of most issues rose about a quarter of a point in quiet pre-holiday trading.
There was little activity in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, where prices of the most widely quoted issues rose about an eighth of a point, dealers said. Most of the trading activity was in New York State Thruway bonds.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 16-day cash management bills:
