HEADLINE: 'Junior Partner'? No Way

BYLINE: By Gennadi A. Zyuganov; Gennadi A. Zyuganov is the leader of the Russian Communist Party.

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
It is often said in the American press that Russia's Communists are by definition unfriendly to reform and to the United States. Yet the Communist Party of the Russian Federation was born six years ago precisely as a party of reform in opposition to decades of stagnation and to Mikhail Gorbachev's itch for revolution. While the West sang hallelujahs to perestroika, we knew that revolutions in Russia have always had painful consequences.
We thus called for evolutionary reform consistent with Russian historical traditions and world trends. Unfortunately, we were not listened to, and the Soviet Union collapsed. 
 Boris Yeltsin's regime has thoughtlessly tried to bring the "blessings" of neo-liberalism to Russia, whose economy and character are quite different from those in the West. The results have been disastrous: The gross domestic product and living standards have fallen drastically. Mr. Yeltsin's promises to increase social spending and improve living conditions are merely an electoral maneuver.
Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin are considered friends of the United States. Although we are denied this honor, we will share with you our view of post-Yeltsin relations between the United States and Russia and of Russian foreign policy.
We would restore the might of the Russian state and its status in the world. That would make its policies incomparably more predictable and responsible than they are today.
Our foreign policy priority would be to maintain continuity with the foreign policies of pre-revolutionary Russia and the Soviet Union. We would seek to restore our state's unique role as the pivot and fulcrum of a Eurasian continental bloc -- and its consequent role as a necessary balance between East and West.
We consider the disruption of military and strategic parity caused by the collapse of the Soviet Union dangerously destabilizing. And we see the restoration of the union of the former Soviet peoples -- based on voluntary association -- as a historical necessity dictated by Russia's needs and those of world security. Guided by pragmatism, we would free foreign policy of ideology, which imposes ruinous actions and obligations. We reject fantasies about "world revolution" but also consider the "new world order" no less alien to Russian interests. And we would stringently adhere to universal moral principles and the norms of international law.
Above all, we would concentrate on internal healing and national rebirth. The foreign policy conducive to this effort would be limited to maintaining state security. This rules out being drawn into supranational organizations that claim the right to interfere in others' internal affairs. Thus, we take an extremely negative view of plans to expand NATO into Eastern Europe, up to Russia's border, and we regard the entry of NATO troops into the former Yugoslavia as the first step toward carrying out those dangerous plans.
Several years have passed since the cold war ended, but relations between our countries are far from harmonious. Though it must renounce useless and excessive military spending, Russia never was -- or could be -- a "junior partner." For Americans, too, the burden of being the only superpower is unnecessary and undesirable. Any policy that counts on Russia's remaining in its humiliating position, following in the American wake, is doomed to defeat.
We respect your democratic traditions and outstanding achievements. We are deeply interested in expanding economic cooperation and educational, scientific and cultural exchanges. We are ready to guarantee American investments and to create better conditions for them than now exist.
Recognizing the uniqueness of the American experience, we insist on acknowledgment of our equal right to follow our own path in accordance with our traditions and conditions. The principle of diversity, on which you have successfully based your domestic policy, should extend to foreign policy as well.

HEADLINE: Chicago Gives a Pedestrian Mall the Boot

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 31

 BODY:
There was a time when no place in town was quite so jaunty as State Street on a Saturday night. "On State Street, that great street," sang Frank Sinatra in the song "Chicago," "I just want to say, they do things they don't do on Broadway."
But State Street, in the heart of downtown's Loop, has been struggling for decades, as theater-goers and shoppers have moved to the suburbs and the stores and cinemas have followed. City planners, trying to replicate the success of suburban shopping malls, in 1979 turned a mile-long stretch of State into its own kind of mall, closing the street to traffic, except for buses. But rather than make the street snazzy again, the mall worsened the slump by giving State a quiet, deserted, even dangerous feel. 
 Now, the pedestrian mall is getting what retailers say it has long deserved: jackhammers. The city is going to rip up the broad pedestrian walkways and turn State back into a street, with standard sidewalks and two-way traffic.
"The mall took the excitement out of State Street," said Elizabeth Hollander, who was Chicago's planning commissioner in the 1980's and is now director of a center for urban affairs at DePaul University. "Planners are rethinking these kinds of urban malls. They've learned that cities are different than suburbs. And cities ought to do what cities do best, which is crowd a lot of people together."
More than 200 cities have created pedestrian malls in the last 20 years, according to the American Planning Association. But many cities have reversed course and turned malls back into streets, including Eugene, Ore.; Little Rock, Ark.; Norfolk, Va.; Rockford, Ill., and Oak Park, Ill. Officials in Baltimore are considering doing the same.
"Retailers believe opening the street to traffic means more activity," said Laurie Schwartz, president of the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore, which speaks for business interests. "And it reminds passers-by that stores are open for business."
In Chicago, mall promoters had envisioned a lively alfresco carnival of shoppers and gawkers, with Paris-style curbside cafes. Indeed, outdoor cafes did open. But the street remained open to bus traffic, and the cafe experience did not quite match the ambience of the Left Bank.
"The buses would line up, one after another, like a herd, with their diesel fumes," said Adrian Smith, a partner in the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, which is designing the new State Street, a $24.5 million project that will include special lighting, trees and other improvements.
Planners and architects point out that people like to go where other people are going. It did not help that the vast walkway of the mall gave State an empty look, which, together with the absence of cars, "gave it a deadened feel, like a ghost town," said Craig Wolf, a spokesman for the city's Department of Transportation.
For shopping, State Street has long been a sort of blue-collar cousin to the elegant North Michigan Avenue, which has prospered with upscale attractions like Neiman-Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Burberry's and the Four Seasons Hotel. When affluent suburbanites come to Chicago for a weekend of shopping, it is almost always to North Michigan.
State Street still has the dowager Palmer House hotel, with its elegant lobby. And the street's spectacular Chicago Theater, built as a motion picture palace in the 1920's and styled after the Arc de Triomphe, has attracted the interest of the Walt Disney Company, which has been negotiating with the city on a deal to lease the theater for stage productions.
State Street is also the home address of the venerable Marshall Field department store, which was built in 1868 and then rebuilt after the Great Fire of 1871.
But several other department stores have disappeared from the street since the pedestrian mall was created, including Sears, Montgomery Ward and Goldblatt's.
Still, it is unclear how much the mall can be blamed for State Street's woes, since the economic troubles had started as early as the 1960's.
The stores on State have traditionally catered to middle-income people. And it is that middle-class base that has long been eroding in Chicago, as in many American cities. In the last 40 years, Chicago's population has dropped to 2.7 million, from 3.6 million, while the suburbs continue to grow, reaching deeper into farmland every year.
State Street retailers have long been pushing for the return of cars. Daniel J. Skoda, the president of Marshall Field, said that "bringing back the traffic won't be magic" in boosting sales, "but it's a key."
People on State Street on a recent morning, who were braving temperatures that hovered near zero and a stinging wind that sliced in from Lake Michigan, voiced strong support for bringing back traffic.
"Since people don't drive on State, they forget it's here," said Carmen Rocha, a 24-year-old sales manager who was waiting for a bus at the corner of State and Madison, once said to be the busiest intersection in America. "Hopefully, this will bring the suburbanites and the tourists back into the Loop."
Ann Kramer, a retired telephone operator, who remembers the glory days of State Street a half-century ago and more, said the mall "sounded like a good idea at the time," and added with a laugh, "So do a lot of things."
Mayor Richard M. Daley, who rode one of the jackhammers in a pavement-breaking ceremony on State last week, noted that the mall was so unpopular no one would take credit for its invention.
"As Mayor," Mr. Daley said with a smile, "I have found it difficult to find out whose idea this was in the first place."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Changing the tax system has an allure. But will the fixes work?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
TAX reform is the Republican flavor of the month. The Kemp Commission, recruited by Newt Gingrich to give his party a tonier image on economic issues, is calling for an end to the income tax as we know it. Steve Forbes's tireless pitch for the flat tax has helped him to break away from the pack chasing Bob Dole for the Republican Presidential nomination.
And why not? A makeover of taxes that promises, in the words of the Kemp Commission, to double the rate of economic growth, sure beats abortion or affirmative action as a party-unifying, good-news issue. 
 But most economists aren't buying it. For while it is hard to find a tax specialist who is not charmed by the prospect of starting afresh, virtually all think the Republicans are repackaging green veggies as triple-fudge ice cream.
"It is completely implausible that improving incentives to work, save and invest in a system that has already moved a long way in the right direction would make a significant difference to growth," argues William Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
Nobody has a copyright on the term "tax reform." But for today's Republicans, reform means lower tax brackets and a shift to taxing consumption from savings and investment.
The logic behind lower maximum rates is familiar to anyone who stayed awake in Econ. 101. Income taxes create a wedge between what labor and capital are worth in a competitive market and what workers and capitalists receive as compensation. Make rates high enough, the thinking goes, and Silicon Valley's best and brightest will retire to Aspen. Likewise, economists are intrigued by the flat tax because it would tax the fruit while leaving the orchard to flourish.
So much for theory. How might the changes actually affect growth? There is a near-consensus that the effect would be positive. But with the striking exception of Martin Feldstein of Harvard, number-crunchers doubt that the impact would be visible to the naked eye.
The supply of labor. One way to get faster growth is to induce more people to work longer hours. But the evidence that lower rates make a big difference is underwhelming.
The maximum tax bracket fell from 91 percent to 70 percent in the 1960's under President John F. Kennedy, then to 50 in 1981. The most telling evidence comes, though, from the cut in maximum rates to 28 percent from 50 in 1986.
Randall Mariger, an economist at the Federal Reserve Board, found that rate changes increased the supply of labor by less than 1 percent between 1985 and 1988. Nada Eissa, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, discovered more movement into the labor force among married women with affluent spouses. But since their numbers are small, the overall response was consistent with Mr. Mariger's sobering conclusion.
Mr. Feldstein made a splash last November with the finding that the taxable income of the richest Americans fell by $31 billion after the maximum tax bracket was raised to 42 percent from 31 in 1993. But his research has been sharply challenged: most of the lost income may have been shifted back to 1992 in anticipation of the change. "Labor supply responses to tax rates -- especially tax rates that are already relatively low -- are quite modest," said Joel Slemrod of the University of Michigan Business School.
 
Savings. -- Computer simulations of a change from a tax on all income to a tax only on consumption would increase savings by one-fifth -- a heartening, if not earthshaking, change. But Mr. Gale says that 80 percent of savings is already sheltered in pension accounts. So the impact of sheltering the rest would be proportionately smaller.
Indeed, a switch to a consumption tax might even have perverse results. Without the incentive of tax breaks, Mr. Gale asks, "how many corporations would maintain their pension plans?"
 
Investment. -- Here the picture seems brighter: "I think there would be a substantial increase in investment," Mr. Gale said. But Mr. Slemrod of Michigan is quick to rain on the optimists' parade. For one thing, he says, industrial investment would grow at the expense of housing. For another, taxes on capital are lower than is widely understood, largely because of rapid write-offs allowed by Washington. Hence the potential bang is likely to be smaller than advertised.
It is easy to see why Republicans are flogging tax reform. And it is equally easy to see why many are entranced by the intellectual elegance and simplicity of the flat tax. But as the Kemp Commission's vision of sugar plums suggests, the gap between promise and reality is wide.
"The flat tax is fine in principle," Mr. Gale said. "But could you make it function in the real -- that is, messy -- world of politics?"

The Faberge Egghead

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: DERRY, N.H.

 BODY:
If George Bush reminded some women of their first husband, Steve Forbes must remind them of their first husband's accountant.
He speaks in a monotone. He shows no emotion, except when he is pleased at some joke he has ventured, and then he looks, for a moment, like a bobbing-head doll in the back of a car: his head goes east to west, his smile goes north to south, and he gives a sort of snort-giggle. His flat-tax monomania makes past New Hampshire oratory, like "Message: I care," seem poetic. (Flat is right.) 
 When Mr. Forbes vows to take the tax code and "scrap it, kill it, drive a stake through its heart and bury it," it plays more Wally Cox than Colin Powell. And he occasionally gets tangled the way Mr. Bush did here with "Nitty Ditty Nitty Gritty Great Bird." Band. At the Nashua Country Club, the 48-year-old publisher lambasted critics of the flat tax as "Chicken Littles -- I don't mean to take Chicken Little's name in vain . . . these fearmongering Washington insider lawyer lobbyists Chicken Roosters or Chicken Littles, whatever they want to call themselves." (I cry fowl.)
Newsweek calls it "geek chic," and voters here like him. The Live-Free-or-Die crowd is not interested in nuance. They want ultimatums.
New Hampshire got fascinated by the unfascinating last time around, too. Paul Tsongas won the '92 Democratic primary with an eat-your-oat-bran economics message that struck many as refreshingly unvarnished. But then it turned out Lowell didn't play in Lubbock, and voters did not really want to sacrifice very much, much less everything, for the next generation.
(St. Paul is still literally wagging his finger at us on the cover of his new book, "Journey of Purpose," and warning that focusing on self "to the exclusion of our progeny" is "violative of basic human instincts.")
But Mr. Forbes's message is sunny -- "Ordinary people can achieve extraordinary deeds" -- and sunny is violative of dourness.
This is Bob Dole's Groundhog Day. In '88, the Dust Bowl Senator lost on the issue of taxes to a Topsidered scion with a goofy smile. At least the last preppie had a padded resume, compliments of his influential friends. This one has no political resume. At least the last one feigned liking pork rinds. This one is basing his whole campaign on a tax plan that would make the rich richer. (Asked by The Boston Globe why he hadn't campaigned in a lower-income area, Mr. Forbes replied that he had talked to Perot voters. "Oh, I have. I went before United We Stand. . . .")
It would be enough to give Bob Dole a dark, fatalistic view of life, except that he already has one. Just as well. Otherwise, how could he get through the spectacle of a Faberge egghead treating himself to a campaign and ending up the dorky darling of the White Mountains?
Mr. Dole got wounded three weeks before the war ended in Europe. He became Republican chairman just as Watergate was about to hit. When he ran on the ticket with Gerald Ford, they lost by two percentage points. He got beaten in New Hampshire in '88 when he did not take the no-new-taxes pledge that George Bush took and later broke.
This time, Mr. Dole signed the pledge and Steve Forbes comes bouncing up out of nowhere with a different angle. Once again, Mr. Dole looks downbeat when he points out that you can't cut everyone's taxes and still balance the budget.
Just when the 72-year-old Mr. Dole should be taking advantage of the Republican tradition of rewarding those who have paid their dues, he finds that the revolutionaries have burned down the clubhouse.
Bill Kristol, the editor of The Standard, who has wooed Colin Powell and raised the Dole age issue, now says: "I hope he can play the lion-in-winter card. There's something moving about the guy's stoicism."
It wasn't pretty yesterday when Mr. Dole showed up at the Nutfield Brewery in Derry for an event his staff had tried to cancel -- inaugurating a beer called Old Man Ale.
What was the symbolism, a reporter called out -- an old man in the White House?
Mr. Dole forced a smile and said the beer tasted "young and fresh." All this time spent waiting to run the country, and he still can't run a photo op?
No wonder Mr. Dole watches Steve Forbes in amazement. It's all geek to him.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off After Rates Are Cut By the Fed and the Bundesbank

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell slightly against most leading currencies yesterday, gaining little support from cuts in interest rates in the United States and Germany.
During trading in Asia yesterday, the dollar continued its recent rally against the German mark and the Japanese yen. But it later fell as traders took profits on the back of a German rate cut. 
 The Federal Reserve announced in the afernoon that it was cutting two interest rates, prompting the dollar to gyrate against the mark and yen in late trading.
The dollar settled slightly higher than the levels it reached just before the Fed announcement.
"There is no major reason to sell the dollar just because the Fed eased," said John Rothfield, an international economist at the Chicago office of Nationsbanc-CRT. "I think there would have been more of a reaction if the Fed hadn't moved."
In late trading, the dollar bought 1.4891 marks, compared with 1.4893 Tuesday. The dollar ended at 107.04 yen, down from 107.25 yen.
Now the markets' attention turns to the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, which is expected to decide today whether it will cut two other important rates.
European officials have been worried about their weakening economies, raising speculation that rates would be reduced to spur spending and lending. Expectations of lower rates have helped to lift the dollar in recent days to highs not seen in two years.
After the dollar continued higher during initial trading yesterday, traders collected profits in anticipation of the cuts and the dollar's value sagged.
Then, as expected, the German central bank allowed its two-week securities repurchase rate to drop and Belgium followed with a rate cut of its own.
Since rate reductions weaken a country's assets and make its currency less attractive, traders sought other currencies, including the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta, the French franc and the Swedish krona.
The Fed's move later was to lower two rates by a quarter point: its official discount rate, to 5 percent, and its target for the Federal funds rate, to 5.25 percent.
The Canadians followed with a quarter-point cut in the overnight lending rate.
Mr. Rothfield of Nationsbanc-CRT said that since the markets anticipated the rate cuts, there was no significant reaction other than the jitters in late trading in the United States.

HEADLINE: This Model Was Too Rough;
Why Economic Forecasting Became a Sideshow

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Want to know what I.B.M.'s in-house economist thinks is in store for the American economy in 1996? You're out of luck: the giant computer maker, which counted more than two dozen economists on its payroll in the early 1970's, no longer employs a single professional to estimate key numbers like interest rates, capital spending and inflation.
And the International Business Machines Corporation has lots of company. Dozens of other big corporations have either slashed or eliminated their forecasting staffs and signed up with commercial services to do their crystal gazing for them. "It's more economical," said Bruce Bunch, a spokesman for the General Electric Company, a conglomerate with $60 billion in annual sales -- and no in-house economist. 
 Actually, the cutbacks have a lot more to do with disillusionment than with dollars. Corporate America's faith in computer-model economic forecasting, already eroded by its failure to signal the stagflation of the late 1970's or the economic turnaround of the early 1980's, has been further shaken by recent research on the complexities of the buying habits of households and businesses.
As a result, most big companies today are giving short shrift to economic forecasting and focusing instead on reducing their exposure to risk. Rather than pouring numbers into computers, they are using financial derivatives to hedge against price and interest rate changes, are minimizing inventories and are employing temporary workers whenever possible.
That means, some people say, that a promising, if flawed, approach to corporate planning has been relegated to an undeserved limbo. If Americans held unrealistic expectations for forecasting in the 1960's -- as they did for so many other things in that optimistic age, from space exploration to big government -- they may now be setting their sights too low, proponents of forecasting say.
"Forecasts do a lot better than Ouija boards," said Stephen McNees, a former vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston who has been keeping track of the forecasters the lasttwo decades.
Academic critics must shoulder some of the blame for the failure of forecasting to live up to its early promise. In effect, they have abandoned the field to business economists with neither the time nor the incentives to break new ground. "Research economists have shown little interest in improving forecasting techniques or testing the models," lamented Ray Fair of Yale University, one of the few academics who still focuses on the field.
"Models" of the economy -- series of statistically estimated equations that describe the determinants of consumption, investment and the like -- were first put together in the 1930's. But most of the credit for developing them goes to Lawrence Klein, whose pioneering efforts in the 1950's later brought him the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science.
The 1960's were a golden era for the model builders, who constructed ever more elaborate edifices to simulate the economy and fed them into the big mainframe computers just coming onto the market. But hopes were dashed in the 1970's, when the models failed to meet the test of predicting the consequences of exploding oil prices.
For example, the President's Council of Economic Advisers' forecast for 1974 overestimated economic growth by a whopping three percentage points and underestimated inflation by the same figure. Most forecasters were also caught off guard by the severity of the 1980-82 recession that was triggered by the Federal Reserve Board's radical tightening of monetary policy and by the speedy turnaround in 1983.
These shortcomings reinforced objections from a new generation of theorists, many of them heavily influenced by the work of Robert Lucas, the Nobel-winning theorist from the University of Chicago. They complained in particular of forecasting's failure to account for the role of expectations in determining how businesses and households respond. For example, the computer models link personal consumption to take-home pay in relatively mechanical ways, while in reality the proportion of income that is spent may turn on expectations about tax and price increases and job security.
As doubts about its accuracy grew in the 1970's, academic interest in forecasting withered. While the Federal Reserve Board and a few universities, notably the University of Michigan, maintained computer models, most of the action shifted to business. "I.B.M. employed 26 Ph.D.'s and near-Ph.D.'s to run their own macro model," recalled Brian O'Connor, one of the 26. Big forecasting firms like Wharton Econometrics (since renamed WEFA) and Data Resources (now DRI/McGraw-Hill) provided retail shopping for companies that could not afford I.B.M.'s wholesale route.
As skepticism spread beyond academia in the 1980's, however, the forecasting industry underwent a shakeout in which corporations reduced or scuttled their forecasting departments and all but a handful of independent services went out of business. I.B.M. retired its entire staff. "Most now work as consultants for the forecasting services," Mr. O'Connor said. His own consulting firm, Ridgewood Economic Associates, sells forecasts to his old employer.
Alan P. Murray, now deputy general manager at Fuji Bank in New York, remembers the 1970's at Citibank, "when the budget was built around the bank's own forecast." Today, Citibank, the principal unit of Citicorp, has virtually abandoned in-house forecasting in favor of risk management. Rather than predicting interest rates and then borrowing and lending accordingly, for example, the bank matches liabilities against assets in ways intended to protect the bottom line no matter what happens to interest rates.
The decline of forecasting by banks, which had been among its most enthusiastic promoters, was hastened by deregulation, according to Robert R. Davis, chief economist for America's Community Banks, a trade association representing 2,000 savings institutions. "When banks were banned from paying interest on checking deposits," he recalled, "they gave away free services, including forecasts, to corporate customers." After the ban was lifted, he added, "depositors took the money."
While the reports generally don't come free today, they come relatively cheap. Most Fortune 500 companies buy forecasts from commercial services and, Mr. O'Connor noted, "For $500 a year, you can get 50-some opinions from Blue Chip Economic Indicators," a newsletter that surveys professional forecasters.
Companies that retain in-house forecasters usually piggyback on the commercial services -- a process facilitated by the revolution in desktop computing. Laurence Meyer & Associates in St. Louis offers a "small" macro model of 350 equations, ready to be plugged into any personal computer and used as a benchmark for specialized forecasts. "We use the Meyer model to test the coherence of our own assumptions and look at how others are thinking," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company.
The surviving forecasting services have one thing in common: flexibility. DRI/McGraw-Hill sells everything from raw data for the German economy to detailed predictions of computer industry revenues in the Middle Atlantic States along with generous dollops of interpretation. "Clients are saying 'we need you to make the numbers immediately relevant,' " said Roger Brinner, DRI/ McGraw-Hill's chief economist.
Even forecasting's most ardent disciples are quick to point out the limitations of its techniques. "They aren't good at timing issues -- say, predicting which quarter the recession will begin," said Mr. McNees, the former Boston Fed vice president who is now a private consultant. Nor do they accurately predict the impact of big shocks, like wars or energy supply disruptions.
What forecasting can do is improve the odds of accurately gauging trends and save companies -- and taxpayers -- money. Mr. Brinner proudly contends that DRI/McGraw-Hill has predicted auto sales better than any of the auto companies. And he is happy to recall that in 1992 his forecast spared Massachusetts the agony of massive spending cutbacks in response to the state's official projection of a 9 percent fall in revenues. DRI/McGraw-Hill used its more sophisticated resources to forecast virtually unchanged revenues -- a forecast that proved to be right on the nose.
Mr. McNees has looked at the errors made by a sample of private forecasters polled by the American Statistical Association. From 1972 through 1994 the forecasters' one-year-ahead forecasts of gross national product missed by an average of one percentage point, while the forecasts of inflation were off by an average of nine-tenths of a point.
That is roughly half the size of the errors generated by extrapolating from the previous four years. And while the record is mixed, private forecasts incorporating the economic assumptions of the 1960's generally do better than models that ask the computer to search randomly for statistical correlations in recorded data.
What frustrates Mr. Fair at Yale is that the science of forecasting has stalled. One reason, he argues, is that the computer results are always second-guessed by the forecasters before they are published. Even the Federal Reserve, which has a large staff to maintain its forecasting model and faces no competitive pressures, mixes technical rigor with seat-of-the-pants subjectivity. "The results of the model are one of many inputs into the Fed's forecasts," confirmed Janet Yellen, the newest member of the Fed's board of governors.
But the main drag on forecasting is the near-indifference of high-powered academic economists. Macro forecasting got its initial lift on the backs of giants. But only a few top-rank researchers, among them Mr. Fair of Yale and John Taylor of Stanford, remain innovators in the field of economics that is arguably the most important in day-to-day life.
Adding insult to injury, the decline in interest in macroeconomic theory also discouraged attention from statisticians searching for ways to suck more information, more reliably, out of less data. "Most of the forecasting models use statistical techniques dating from the 1950's," Mr. Fair said.
Saul Hymans, director of the University of Michigan's Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics, attributes much of the decline in academic interest to what he calls the "nihilist" disavowal of 1960's economics before more modern theory could be incorporated in forecasting models.
In other words, Mr. Hymans lamented, "We're losing sight of what we're supposed to be doing in economics."

HEADLINE: GIULIANI'S BUDGET PLAN: REVENUES;
Parking Meters May Be Sold To a Company

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
New York State has sold off a prison and a highway to raise quick cash. Now the city wants to sell off one of its most familiar fixtures -- its parking meters.
In a complicated plan that is still short on detail, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday proposed shifting the maintenance and operation of the city's 68,000 parking meters to a private company. 
 Under the proposal, the city would create a local authority to take control of the meters. That authority would in turn hire a private operator to run them. The authority would sell bonds that would provide as much as $300 million to the city up front. Revenues from the meters would be used to pay off the bonds and supply income to the private company. The city would continue to set the parking rates on the meters.
The Mayor and city budget officials touted the plan as a quick way to raise money while also improving city operations. But fiscal monitors immediately criticized the plan as a gimmick that would provide only temporary relief.
Calling the proposal a "particularly disturbing one-shot" that may eliminate revenue in future years, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said: "The city's excessive reliance on one-shots continues to reflect a lack of adequate planning for adverse developments."
The Mayor argued, however, that the parking meter plan, along with proposals to sell the Brooklyn Army Terminal, a city-run industrial complex in Sunset Park, and about 2,000 city-owned parking lots to private companies, could do more than offer one-time cash infusions. Although the Mayor's plan states that those measures would give the city a $300 million boost next year, Mr. Giuliani said contracts could require the private companies to share future revenues with the city.
"Those items will have recurring value to the city," he said. "If we use the models of other cities, we would be partners in the proceeds and would be able to realize even more revenues than we realize now."
John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for economic development, said selling the Brooklyn Army Terminal and the vacant lots would essentially help get the city out of the business of property management.
"We need to focus down on the essentials of city government," Mr. Dyson said. "Because the city traditionally did too much, I think it's fair to say that it didn't do anything very well. If we did fewer things, we could do the remaining things better."
Although the city has never before privatized parking meters in the way Mr. Giuliani proposes, over the last 30 years the city has tried numerous times to have private contractors handle parking meter collections. But the city created its own Parking Meter Service Unit in 1987, after dozens of employees from private collection companies were charged with large-scale theft from the city.
Mr. Dyson noted, however, that the city has been doing what he characterized as a "less than crisp" job of operating the meters, noting that about 11 percent of the meters are broken at any given time.
The Mayor's plan also recommended a variety of other new sources of money for the city. Among them is a plan to sell one of seven police helicopters, to raise $150,000. And the Mayor proposes to charge a funeral-related fee of $25 to get approval from the Department of Health to carry out a cremation. The city reviews about 7,500 deaths each year solely to grant permission for cremation, and officials estimate that the new fee would bring in about $187,000 a year.
Other proposals include:
*A new $390 fee on civil service exams for police officers to help cover the cost of psychological, medical and drug tests and background investigations. That fee is expected to raise $663,000 for the city.
*Increases in parking fees at Shea and Yankee Stadiums for an additional $435,000 in income. Parking rates would go from $5 to $6 for cars, $12 to $15 for limousines and $15 to $18 for buses.

It's No Rally, But Bonds Do Move Higher

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved moderately higher yesterday but fell short of the strong rally some traders expected after a cut in short-term rates by the Federal Reserve Board.
The reduction was the third by the Fed in eight months as it has attempted to reignite the economy; the last cut came on Dec. 19. 
 The announcement, following a meeting of the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee, cited "moderating economic expansion" as the reason for the cut. But with the outcome widely anticipated in the market, prices of Government securities eased after an initial surge when the Fed reduced the Federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.25 percent, and the discount rate by a similar amount, to 5 percent.
By late in the day some big banks -- notably Chase Manhattan and NBD Bank in Detroit -- were lowering their prime lending rates to 8.25 percent from 8.50 percent.
Early in the session, data on producer prices and the Chicago purchasing manager's index had a mild impact on trading. December producer prices rose over all by five-tenths of 1 percent, with the closely watched core rates -- excluding the more volatile food and energy sectors -- up only a tenth of 1 percent. The Chicago purchasing managers' index came in at 50.9 for December, below the 53.0 that had been expected, and at 54.8 for November, after a downward revision.
Early rumors suggesting that the Fed would make an early announcement yesterday caused bond prices to trade higher. The March bond futures contract was as high as 121 7/32, with the low price at 120 13/32 before closing at 120 31/32. Still, it is well below the top of the current consolidation range, of between 121 28/32 and 122 10/32, that has held since the beginning of December.
But the Fed played coy in saying it had no idea when the announcment would be made, only to make announce its action when it typically has done so, around 2:15 P.M.
The 30-year bond rose 5/32, to 111 23/32 to yield 6.02 percent, down from 6.04 percent on Tuesday.
The Treasury announced that next week it planned to sell $18.5 billion of three-year notes on Tuesday; $14 billion of 10-year notes on Wednesday, and $8 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday, along with $8 billion of seven-day cash management bills. By late in the day, in when-issued trading, the three-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.03 percent, the 10-year note was at 5.57 percent, and the 30-year bond was at 5.97 percent.
P. Christopher Leary, senior vice president and portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management, said that to a certain extent yesterday was a "buy the rumor, sell on the fact type of day."
He added, "I think the more speculative investors were holding out for a 50-basis-point cut on both key rates."
 He did, however, note some significance in the announcement by the Fed. He said that the Fed, for the first time he could recall, mentioned the strength of the economy, and not just inflation, in making its announcement.
"I think this is really a significant week: a lot of data, the F.O.M.C. meeting and the quarterly refunding announcement," Mr. Leary said. "Supply is always an unknown, given the fact that between now and the refunding the high probability is that we get more weak economic data highlighted by the nonfarm payroll data on Friday."

HEADLINE: GIULIANI'S BUDGET PLAN: THE OVERVIEW;
GIULIANI'S BUDGET CUTS SPENDING 5% AND LOWERS TAXES

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani presented a preliminary $31 billion budget yesterday that would cut New York City's total spending by nearly 5 percent, continue to reduce taxes and rely heavily on help from Albany and Washington that appears unlikely to come.
As he presented the rough outline of his third budget as Mayor, Mr. Giuliani said the city needed to cut still more to reverse decades of overspending. But this time he couched his austere message in the language of compassion that has marked his oratory in recent weeks. 
 Even as he vowed to protect "the most vulnerable in society," the Mayor accepted the deeper cuts in welfare and Medicaid proposed by Gov. George E. Pataki, a fellow Republican. And he proposed nearly $700 million in cuts to most of the city's agencies, raising the prospect of further erosion of services used by thousands, if not millions, of New Yorkers.
"Balancing the numbers of the budget, however, is the easiest part of it," Mr. Giuliani said, presenting his proposals in the old Board of Estimate Chambers at City Hall. "The most important part of it is that it balance the needs of people, that it balance the needs of society, that it can't be devoted to one priority."
The Mayor's budget would cut spending on the city's public schools by $160 million, or 5 percent, even as the Board of Education faces deeper cuts in aid from the state and Federal governments. It would also cut emergency rent assistance for poor tenants and lunch subsidies for welfare recipients in job training.
The city's recycling program would face new cuts, as would the three library systems, which may have to close some branches an additional day. Now they are open six days a week.
The city's museums and cultural institutions, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, also face a 16 percent cut in the city's steadily declining subsidies.
"There are very few people who understand the role of the museums better than the Mayor," said William H. Luers, the president of the Metropolitan, citing the museum's role as a magnet for tourism. "This kind of cut can only show that this is a very bad year. It's going to be very difficult for us to make up this money."
The Mayor's preliminary proposal, the first step in a long march toward a final budget for the fiscal year that begins in July, came under immediate attack from various quarters.
The city's fiscal monitors and bond raters strongly criticized the plan. They dismissed the Mayor's declaration that he had finally begun to untangle the city's fiscal problems and accused him of relying on budgetary gimmicks and unrealistic assumptions to balance the budget.
A major credit rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, said the city's bond rating, already among the lowest of any major city, could fall further. Richard P. Larkin, managing director of Standard & Poor's, the other major rating agency, said the Mayor's budget confirmed the expectations that caused his agency to lower the rating last year.
"It's pretty much what we expected when we lowered the rating," Mr. Larkin said. "The city continues to live year to year."
The city's Democratic elected officials denounced many of the cuts as unacceptable and misguided. The City Council's Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, criticized the Mayor for not having embraced his proposal to use the 12.5 percent surcharge on the city's income tax for a program to rebuild schools, instead of allowing the tax to expire in December as a tax cut.
"It's more pain and no gain," said Mr. Vallone, who will lead negotiations with Mr. Giuliani over the final shape of a budget.
The preliminary budget announced yesterday reflected the Mayor's proposals for closing a projected budget gap of $2 billion for the fiscal year that begins in July. It is almost certain to change in the months ahead.
The gap has arisen despite Mr. Giuliani's two years of cutting, including the reduction of 17,000 municipal employees, because the city's spending continues to rise faster than revenues.
In some ways, the Mayor's proposal represented a departure from the past. For the first time, he proposed cutting the Police Department's $2 billion budget, reducing the police force by 900 from its current level and by 1,500 from the peak of 38,310 last year mandated by the state law known as Safe Streets, Safe City.
In all, the Mayor plans to reduce the payroll by at least 3,000 workers, to 203,000 by the end of the next fiscal year, imposing a strict hiring freeze to cut jobs as workers retire or otherwise leave their jobs.
The proposal also calls for laying off 150 workers at the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, the independent agency that operates the city's 11 hospitals and medical centers. Those would be the first layoffs of unionized workers under Mr. Giuliani, who has so far reduced the work force by attrition and severance packages.
In addition to the cuts in agency spending, the Mayor's budget would rely on $650 million in savings in the city's share of Medicaid and welfare, which the Governor has proposed reducing, as well as $100 million in new state aid for jails, busing for disabled preschoolers and City University of New York. The plan also hopes for $50 million from the Federal Government -- mostly, the Mayor said, in crime-fighting aid.
The Mayor said the largest slice from the state, at $351 million, should come from the $1.3 billion the state hopes to receive from the Federal Government under a new formula for Medicaid. That new formula, however, has languished in the budget impasse in Washington. Even if approved, the Governor has proposed keeping the $1.3 billion to balance the state's budget.
In Albany yesterday, aides to Mr. Pataki and the Republican majority leader of the Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, said it would be difficult for the state to agree to more aid, given its own budget gaps and the uncertainty from Washington. The Governor's spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, suggested that the Mayor should instead do more to support the $955 million in savings Mr. Pataki's budget would give, although city officials have said the savings are exaggerated.
Mr. Giuliani, in keeping with his philosophy, proposed still more tax cuts that would cost the city $349 million in lost revenues next year and $5 billion during the next five years. In addition to the expiration of the personal income tax surcharge, he proposed a reduction in the sales tax on clothing costing less than $500, and a series of smaller cuts in business taxes that the Mayor said would stimulate the economy.
"We don't do tax reductions for the rich or the middle class," the Mayor said. "We do tax reductions based on a different philosophy: Will they produce jobs?"
As proposed, the Mayor's budget would include the largest percentage cut in spending since the Depression, although experience suggests that the scope of the cut will decrease as spending increases through the year. At this time last year, Mr. Giuliani also proposed a cut of the same magnitude, but since then spending has continued to rise so the current budget actually ends up spending more than that of the year before.
Yesterday's proposals also included the Mayor's plan to close a yawning gap of $759 million in the city's current budget with only five months left in the fiscal year. He proposed immediate cuts totaling $207 million, as well as a series of fiscal maneuvers that became the focus of the harshest criticism from the fiscal monitors, from selling the city's television station to auctioning the right to collect unpaid property taxes.
Mr. Giuliani defended such actions, saying they were needed "to ameliorate the burden that could be created by having to do further cuts."

Index of Commodity Prices Soars To Highest Level in Five Years

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Commodity prices rose to their highest levels in more than five years yesterday as frigid temperatures in much of North America threatened crops and lifted demand for heating fuels.
The Commodity Research Bureau index of 17 commodities surged 2.05 points, to 247.5, its highest level since May 1990, as the cold weather increased prices for coffee, orange juice, heating oil and natural gas. Gold prices also rose. 
 "The sharp run-up in the C.R.B. index shows we can sustain some commodity inflation," said Bernard Savaiko, a senior metals analyst with the Paine Webber Group in New Jersey.
Cold weather also sent coffee prices soaring to a four-month high. Forecasters said Arctic air descending from Canada into the Midwest could bring freezing temperatures this weekend to coffee-growing areas in Mexico, the world's fourth-largest producer.
Coffee for March delivery rose 9.05 cents, to $1.286 a pound, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, its highest level since Nov. 15.
Prospects for a smaller Mexican crop next year come amid mounting concern that Brazil's crop, which is harvested beginning in June, will not fully rebound from two frosts and a drought in 1994. Also, heavy rains wiped out expected increases this year in Mexican and Central American crops.
"The supply situation has caught up with the market," said Luis Berthart, a coffee trader with the Lamborn Futures Group in Miami. "There's not a lot of coffee coming in. The market is tight."
Natural gas and heating oil prices gained on increased demand for heating fuels.
"With this cold weather right now, everyone wants to make sure they have enough supplies," said Dale Wong, a natural gas trader at Nationsbanc-CRT in Houston.
March natural gas soared 15.4 cents, to $2.658, for each 1,000 cubic feet on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: Last of Refugees From Cuba In '94 Flight Now Enter U.S.

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 31

 BODY:
After nearly a year and a half of detention at the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Caridad Alonso could have entered the United States two weeks ago. But she wanted to be one of the last Cubans to leave the refugee camps.
"I wanted to stay here for the end," the 44-year-old woman said on Tuesday night, the eve of the last refugees' charter flight to Florida. "I wanted to see the last rafter go." 
 The last 124 Cubans to leave Guantanamo arrived at Homestead Air Force Base here today, and the Government officially closed down the tent cities on the military base. They were erected in the spring and summer of 1994 during the mass exodus of Cubans and Haitians from their homelands by boat and raft. More than 29,000 Cubans and 21,000 Haitians were held in Guantanamo. Most of the Cubans gradually gained entry into the United States and most of the Haitians were sent home. The last contingent of Haitians left in November.
The Cuban exodus, fueled by fears of worsening economic conditions, resulted from the loosening enforcement of border patrols. Haitians were fleeing political violence and poverty at home. The detention policy led to rioting and suicide attempts in the camps, and court cases and protests in the United States. Running the camps for the Haitians and Cubans cost the Government at least $150 million, and the final estimate, when the calculations are completed, could far exceed that.
Clinton Administration officials say that detaining the refugees solved an immigration crisis and deterred others from taking illegally to the seas, often in handmade vessels that were unsafe.
Although Cubans and Haitians are still setting out for Florida -- the Coast Guard intercepted 1,126 Haitian and 114 Cuban migrants in the last three months of 1995 -- the flow of rafts and boats is now a trickle.
Cuban and Administration officials negotiated immigration accords in 1994 to allow Cubans to apply in Havana for 20,000 visas annually, making the influx more orderly.
But critics note that conditions in neither Cuba nor Haiti have changed enough to preclude another mass flight, and that Guantanamo hardly offers a model for a future response.
"It was a successful form of migration management but it was done at the expense of the respect for basic human rights, most specifically the restrictions on liberty under highly militarized circumstances," said Arthur C. Helton, director of migration programs of the Open Society Institute, a New York-based research organization involved in refugee issues. Instead, the institute advocates a coordinated response by countries in the region.
For Cuban exiles, the release of the Guantanamo refugees came at an unprecedented cost -- for the first time the United States withdrew its unconditional welcome to those taking to the sea to escape the Communist rule of Fidel Castro. At least 266 Cubans have been sent back to their country since May, when the Clinton Administration began intercepting Cuban rafters at sea and sending them home.
In Miami, the cradle of the Cuban exile community, hard-line anti-Castro organizations are still reeling from that decision, arguing that the root of the problem is Mr. Castro, not his "victims." But they are a minority in Florida, where a 1980 boatlift brought more than 100,000 Cubans to the state, overwhelming resources. State officials have lobbied for tighter immigration controls for years.
The refugee camps embodied rejection, but a spokesman for the joint military task force that ran the camps said they provided a transition site that made the Cubans "the best-prepared migrant population to reach the shores." While they waited, agonizing about the future, the Cubans, most of them young men, learned English, computer skills or how to balance a checkbook. They worked in clinics, worked on construction projects, including setting up portable restrooms, and spent time writing journals and painting. Help came from private agencies and volunteer groups as well as from the Government.
It was, said Renato Dominguez, a 30-year-old doctor released two months ago, a productive nightmare.
"I polished my English," he said. "I learned to write medical histories like the Americans. I made good contacts. I have job references from all over the United States."
Surveys also show high education levels that make this Cuban wave similar to the early exiles who came in the 1960s, says Juan Clark, a sociologist with Miami-Dade Community College here. He said a sample of 642 refugees showed that 46 percent had studied beyond high school. Ninety percent cited the lack of liberties as the main reason for leaving, he said.
Officials in Florida, where more than 60 percent of the refugees have stayed because they had families and friends there, said the release of the Cubans has not caused major problems because it was gradual, starting in October of 1994 with the old, the sick and families with children. Federal officials have given Florida $18 million in emergency assistance to offset resettlement costs in addition to money for job placement and English training.
Resettlement agencies working with the Cubans say the refugees have found a tight job market because there is high competition for work that does not require fluency in English. Many, including professionals who need to pass exams for licenses, have taken low-paying jobs in restaurants, hotels, stores and at the airport, and some have moved to other states with better prospects despite connections in South Florida.
Dr. Dominguez plans to move to Alabama next week to take a job with a chicken processing plant that pays $5.95 an hour. He has already recruited more than 100 Guantanamo migrants. Among them is Gerardo Mir, 58, an industrial electrician who said a two-month search yielded no jobs.
"We came here to work," said Mr. Mir, whose new job meant leaving his 24-year-old son, another Guantanamo refugee who is already working in a Miami Beach restaurant.
But the area has absorbed many others, and those who stayed here often run into each other as they bicycle to and from appointments or jobs. Even in menial jobs, cramped apartments and cases of sponsors who have reneged on their commitment for financial and other reasons, the refugees still find life in the states a paradise compared to Guantanamo. There, despite generally good relations and even friendships with their keepers, they slept in cots, ate the same food daily and waited suspended in time for months.
Today, the last arrivals from Guantanamo waved happily and smiled broadly as teary-eyed relatives drove them out of Homestead in a caravan.
"I can't believe I'm here," said Osvaldo Espinosa, 24, who spent one year and five months on the base.
"I feel free," said an exuberant Fernando Larduyt, 25, who says he spent 538 days in Guantanamo, and brought an American flag draped around his shoulders. "I can say what I feel. Down with Fidel!"
Back in Guantanamo, the makeshift schools, churches, libraries and recreation centers have been dismantled and life has largely returned to normal for the population of 5,000, including military personnel, their families and contract employees.
Military officials say the cots are going to Atlanta for the Olympics and the wood from hardback tents has been donated to Haiti and Panama for housing. But the base has kept materials to house about 10,000 refugees, in case the need arises again.

HEADLINE: White House Wish: Healthy Economy in Election

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's move today to nudge along a sputtering economic expansion highlights the one question that looms over almost every political strategy meeting at the White House these days: What are the chances that President Clinton will run into the kind of economic downturn that killed off George Bush's candidacy four years ago?
The Fed's answer, reading between the lines of its analysis of the economy, is that a pre-election downturn is possible but increasingly unlikely. The Federal Reserve policy makers who approved a modest cut in short-term interest rates seem to be taking the view that resonates through conversations with chief executives and investment bankers. Things are slowing down a bit, the nation's business leaders contend, but nothing like the recession of 1991 and 1992. 
 President Clinton's problem, however, is that the public perception of the economy's direction is very different, and not nearly as optimistic. Poll after poll reveals that many Americans feel more economically insecure than at any time in recent memory, and that they no longer believe that national economic growth translates into personal prosperity.
In fact, for all of the obsessive attention paid to the Federal Reserve -- its mood, its reading of the economic indicators, its internal politics -- in times like this its powers are limited.
"We're stuck with the problem that we've had for the past several years, that the perception is far worse than the reality," one of Mr. Clinton's economic advisers said today. "And that's something the Fed can't really help with."
What the Fed can do is help keep the economy on a relatively even keel. While it takes time for interest rate cuts to work their way through the economy, the Fed is certainly in a position to prevent a slide from getting worse.
But that is only true if the Fed recognizes the problem and acts more decisively than it did in late 1990 and early 1991. In hindsight, the recession of that era was under way well before Fed policy makers and outside analysts realized it and it turned out to be much worse than experts thought at the time.
Most analysts are convinced the Fed has learned its lesson. "This time they did the right thing at the right time," said Allen Sinai, the chief global economist at Lehman Brothers. "There was only one year the Fed didn't do it right in a Presidential election year, and that was 1992. Poor George Bush."
Avoiding a recession, of course, is hardly a guarantee for any incumbent. The economy was strong in November 1994, when the Republicans swept the House and the Senate. But even though robust growth -- annual gains of 3 or 4 percent in the gross domestic product -- is supposed to help the incumbent President, it did little to stop the backlash against President Clinton.
The underlying problem for President Clinton is that even a healthy economy is no cure-all. White House officials are acutely aware that the Fed has only one, fairly blunt weapon at its disposal -- the control of short-term interest rates. And while that weapon can, in Mr. Sinai's phrase, do "magical things to an economy," it may not be very well honed for fighting the kind of pervasive anxieties that preoccupy American workers, consumers and voters.
The polls are fairly unanimous about those worries. In recent months a number of surveys have shown that consumers are not spending much because they are more worried than anytime in recent history about job security and their ability to save. Even those who hold a good job with sound and profitable companies say the endless headlines about cutbacks make them fear that they could lose their jobs.
The worry may be exaggerated, as the White House insists. But the political reality is that perceptions of economic insecurity are far more important than statistics. So Mr. Clinton has already set about trying to persuade the public that the economy is in better shape than it thinks. In his State of the Union address last week, he called the economy "the healthiest it's been in three decades."

HEADLINE: FEDERAL RESERVE TRIMS KEY RATES TO SPUR ECONOMY

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Worried that the economy has slowed and needs a modest spark, the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates today by one-quarter of a point. The move amounts to tossing out a bit of a lifeline at a time when housing and retail sales are flagging and consumer confidence is sinking.
It is the central bank's second rate cut in less than six weeks. The move is expected to ease borrowing costs for consumers and business, and indeed banking companies, including Citicorp and BankAmerica, shaved the lending rates for their best customers today to 8.25 percent from 8.5 percent. 
 The Federal Reserve's most important action, trimming the rate at which banks lend money to each other overnight to 5.25 percent, could also continue to buoy the stock market, which has set records the last three days, partly in anticipation of a rate cut. Stocks rose again today, with the Dow Jones industrial average climbing 14.09 points.
The Federal Reserve's top rate-setting committee also lowered the discount rate, which it charges on its own loans to banks, to 5 percent from 5.25 percent.
The cuts aprovided a significant symbol of reassurance from Washington -- in contrast to the recent Government shutdowns and budget battles that have left many Americans feeling even more anxious about the future. The moves were welcomed as well by a White House concerned at strategy meetings over the effect a faltering economy could have on the Presidential campaign. [Page D6.]
As large banks cut their prime lending rates, similar reductions are likely to follow in mortgages, home equity loans, small-business loans and some credit card balances, and some economists said they expected the Federal Reserve and private lenders to continue trimming rates over the next several months.
The biggest question, they said, is just how much the economy has slowed -- and whether the central bank has acted quickly and strenuously enough to keep it from stalling.
Only a handful of economists are worried about a recession now. But over the last two weeks, a steady drumbeat of statistics has made it clear that the nation's economic growth rate has fallen sharply.
Most economists estimate that economic growth slid to a rate of about 2 percent in 1995's fourth quarter from a robust 3.2 percent in the previous three months. Many also fear that mounting consumer debt loads and disruptions from snowstorms have pushed it down to about 1 percent so far in 1996.
The slowdown is most evident in consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
Home sales have declined, and retailers reported meager sales gains during the vital holiday shopping season. More ominously, one index this week shows consumer confidence at its lowest level in two years.
Factory orders have also weakened, and new claims for jobless benefits recently hit a six-month high as layoffs continue.
Still, some economists -- and clearly some members of the Federal Reserve's key policy committee -- believe the economy could right itself and resume a steady growth pace without a bigger cut in interest rates. But most economists said they thought more stimulation would be needed, including another round of cuts at the committee's next meeting, set for late March.
"Given the soft economy, the decision to cut interest rates was essential," said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers. He said today's cuts "will begin to correct the vicious cycle of slow growth in employment and incomes and anemic consumer demand."
He added that the outlook for the first half of 1996 is "poor in many respects." He also said he thought that the Federal Reserve still needed to lower the Federal funds rate, the key rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans, by another quarter-point, to 5 percent, to ease the debt burden on many consumers.
Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said he also expected to see "multiple rounds of Fed easing in coming months."
And Lawrence Chimerine, an economist at the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington, said he thought that the Federal Reserve "is still behind the curve" on rates.
Mr. Chimerine said that if key economic statistics remained weak for January and February, "That would be very significant, and they wouldn't be able to blame it on winter storms and the Government shutdown."
He said he also thought that the Federal Reserve should quit taking "baby steps" in cutting rates -- and take another half of a percentage point off the funds rate as soon as possible. He said the Federal Reserve's incremental pace was "unnecessarily keeping the risk too high" for a more serious slowdown. He added that it also was "keeping the markets guessing" about what would happen next -- and prompting many consumers to hold off on home refinancings or major purchases out of expectations of lower rates.
But the Federal Reserve has traditionally been more conscious of combating inflation than promoting growth. And one important condition for further rate cuts is clearly that inflation remain "contained," as the Federal Reserve described it in today's statement.
Before the Federal Reserve announced its rate cuts today, the Labor Department reported that producer prices had risen one-half of 1 percent in December. But most analysts discounted that, saying it was caused by quirks in the seasonal adjustment of energy prices. Excluding volatile energy and food prices, producer prices edged up only one-tenth of 1 percent in December. Producer prices are the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for goods they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers.
Similarly, the inflation in consumer prices was running at only a modest 2.6 percent through last November. So far, the Federal Reserve clearly is betting that the slowdown in growth will keep it from rearing up again soon.
But to some economists, the Federal Reserve's recent trend toward lowering rates represents a risky departure from its usual caution and suggests that its chairman, Alan Greenspan, might be keeping a closer eye than normal on political and market pressures.
Indeed, the Federal Reserve's rate-setting board, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, raised the Federal funds rate seven times to keep the brakes on inflation as the economy grew rapidly in 1994 and early 1995, before trimming twice last year. The last cut came on Dec. 19, a day after the stock market fell 101 points and needed support to resume its record-setting climb.
Most analysts said that if the Federal Reserve had not cut rates today, the stock market might well have plunged again. And while President Clinton is widely expected to reappoint Mr. Greenspan, a Reagan Administration appointee, to a third four-year term starting in March, he has not yet formally done so.
Ken Bercuson, an economist at the Swiss Bank in New York, said that in cutting rates, "the Fed is taking on risk on the inflation side that previous incarnations of the F.M.O.C. would not have taken."
Mr. Bercuson said he feared that increases in wages and raw materials could help inflation start inching up again, perhaps even to 4 percent this year.

HEADLINE: The Mayor's Budget Mirage

 BODY:
After two years of tough spending cuts, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is calling for New York City to continue on a steady and stringent budgetary path toward financial health. But the Mayor's latest fiscal plan, outlined yesterday at City Hall, is filled with shaky assumptions that are likely to collapse, thus requiring bolder and more painful budget reductions in the next several months. To his credit, Mr. Giuliani has begun to rethink some of his earlier budget strategies, particularly in the area of police. But several basic causes of the city's insolvency need to be addressed more aggressively.
Mr. Giuliani ran for office promising to change the basic direction of city government, which expanded in size throughout the 1980's far faster than could be justified by economic realities. He has succeeded in cutting the city's work force by 17,000 employees in his first two years. By far the boldest departure in his newest financial plan is his determination to subject the Police Department to the same regimen of fiscal discipline. 
 Until now, City Hall has maintained that it would be risky to reduce the number of police officers from the current level of 38,000. In his latest presentation, the Mayor said that by using civilians to do the administrative chores now done by officers, no less than 10 percent of the uniformed force could be cut without affecting the numbers fighting crime in the streets. He plans to reduce the force by more than 1,600 in the next two years. He also sent a warning to the powerful Patrolmen's Benevolent Association that if it insisted on approval in Albany of a new collective bargaining mechanism that would lead to more generous labor contracts, he would not hesitate to push civilianization and cut the police force even further.
This tough stance toward the police was Mayor Giuliani at his best, reflecting self-confidence in his biggest area of success, the battle against crime. Now he needs to take the same smart approach to the rest of the city's work force, including the other uniformed services, and demand more concessions on work rules and other costly hindrances to the improvement of productivity in delivering city services. One problem with his latest financial plan is that it calls for no more concessions from employees in the next five years, even though wages and fringe benefits account for half the city's budget.
A year ago Mr. Giuliani was demanding huge and destructive cuts in welfare and Medicaid from the State Legislature to balance the city's budget. This year he has softened that approach but has not come up with alternative savings. Instead his budget relies on a mirage of improbable Federal and state aid and money from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. He is calculating, for example, that Congress will enact Medicaid formulas allocating hundreds of millions of dollars to New York State, and that Albany will agree to pass these on to New York City rather than keep them for the state budget.
While Mr. Giuliani primarily focused on the budget for next year, he said he would close a $1 billion shortfall in the current year by resorting to one-shot savings like the sale of mortgages, the city radio station WNYC and property taxes, and a refinancing of Municipal Assistance Corporation debt. He deplored the use of such one-shot savings when Mayor David Dinkins used them. Now he is using more of these devices in one year than his predecessor did in all his four years.
Fire sales of property and assets to pay for ongoing expenses is the frantic habit of a city that cannot reach the point where revenues and expenses are in permanent balance. Despite considerable progress in the last two years, Mr. Giuliani cannot yet claim he has taken the city to that point.

HEADLINE: Russian Samples Pastrami Politics

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
There was the historic walk in the woods at the Geneva arms control talks in 1982, and before that, the Cold War kitchen debate. Now, Vice President Al Gore has invented a new method of informal superpower interaction: deli diplomacy.
The vice president made an unscheduled stop yesterday at Katz's Delicatessen on Houston Street to introduce his Russian colleague, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, to the joys of corned beef and pastrami on rye. 
The prime minister, normally a borshcht-and-potatoes man, did not appear to get it at first, and he ordered a frankfurter with mustard and sauerkraut, said the night manager, Faye Weissman. But his entourage prevailed upon him to try true deli, she said, and both dignitaries enjoyed the two-handed sandwiches so much that they took doggie bags with them when they left.
The deli foray came as Mr. Chernomyrdin wound down from Washington meetings at which he reassured American officials that despite a Communist resurgence and Government promises of new social spending, Russia's economic reforms would continue apace. He was also fueling himself for a luncheon speech with the same soothing goal, this time before hundreds of business people at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
The pastrami power seemed to work. He delivered a long paean to the improvements in the Russian economy; his diction, which sometimes descends into an indistinct, jowly mumble reminiscent of Marlon Brando in "The Godfather," was clear; his tone calm, confident, almost lilting.
Afterward, he asserted to reporters that "agitation" over doubts about whether the International Monetary Fund would go ahead with a planned $9 billion loan to Russia was vastly exaggerated and premature, and that the loan negotiations were proceeding normally.
He also praised the results of his Washington meetings, which included the announcement of a $1 billion United States loan to Aeroflot, the Russian airline, in an aviation deal that is controversial because it may lead to tougher Russian competition against American companies like Boeing.
In another notable change of schedule in his one-day visit, Mr. Chernomyrdin canceled a trip to the Empire State Building so he could go to Greenwich Village and visit the bier of Joseph Brodsky, the Russian-born poet, who died on Sunday.
But the deli visit seemed the high point of the day. Mr. Chernomyrdin's press secretary, Viktor Konnov, said that when Mr. Gore was asked if he had paid for the food, he said that he had indeed: about $16 for three sandwiches.
Standing around chatting after Mr. Chernomyrdin's luncheon speech, several top-level members of his delegation decided that if they had to choose the headline for the day, it would be "There's no such thing as a free lunch -- especially at Mr. Katz's."

HEADLINE: Schools Brace for State Aid Fluctuations

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: NUTLEY, N.J., Jan. 31

 BODY:
In a process akin to hearing a mortar shell whining in flight and then bracing for the impact, school superintendents across New Jersey await the state aid figures, wondering which districts will take a hit and which will be spared in the distribution of $4 billion from Trenton's purse.
Until today, Dr. Frank T. Votto, the Superintendent of Schools in Nutley, thought he had reason to be optimistic. State officials said there would not be much change from last year, and last year Nutley's district lost just $72,000. And Gov. Christine Todd Whitman visited last week to lavish praise on the district for keeping costs low and results high. 
 Then came the hit. Aid figures released Tuesday lopped $228,000, or 9 percent, off the annual check from the state. The district had already been making minor adjustments. The business administrator, John C. Sincaglia, faxed a few principals to tell them they could not order new videotapes for certain language programs, for example.
But now the district has about two weeks before it is to present its budget, and must decide which big ticket items to skip. Should it avoid replacing a roof for another year? Should the $30,000 allocated for a new lacrosse program in the sports department be sacrificed? And how much money should it seek in new property taxes?
"Every year we all wait with bated breath for the state aid figures," Dr. Votto said. "It is a very difficult process and it creates great anxiety all around."
This year is more or less slated to be the year of education spending in New Jersey, which already dispenses more dollars per student than any other state. The state is under court order to come up with a plan by September to equalize spending between its richest and poorest districts.
School officials hope that the plan will ultimately put a measure of predictability in the process. And there is a lot at stake for Governor Whitman. Although poll takers say she remains very popular, local taxpayers tend to blame her administration when the gap in state aid is closed with money from their wallets.
Most other states have legal formulas for school financing that allow administrators to anticipate a certain level of state aid and then plan accordingly. But this is the fourth year that the New Jersey budget has been done largely on an ad hoc basis, with overall state grants to school districts flat and various factors combined in a different formula each year to divide up the pie. In previous years, for example, increases or decreases in enrollment were ignored, whereas this year they were one of the factors used to determine state aid.
Even holding overall spending steady is a form of cutting the education budget because inflation means a certain erosion in buying power. Overall, the dollars allocated to education went from $3.938 billion last year to $3.985 billion this year. The only large increases were $60 million distributed among 21 of the poorest districts, plus about $10 million for technology, divided among districts strictly by enrollment, at about $8.50 per pupil.
Under a ruling by the New Jersey Supreme Court in July 1994, the state has until the fall of 1997 to close an estimated $450 million disparity in spending between the richest and poorest districts. So far only about $186 million has been invested.
"We have had very little movement this year and there is no indication of movement next year, so we will be faced with a balloon payment the first year of the required new statute," said Steve Block, a spokesman for the Education Law Center, which filed the lawsuit seeking education parity. "So the state is really backing itself into a corner."
But the state said its new formula is not going to be driven by money. The Commissioner of Education, Dr. Leo F. Klagholz, will next week issue recommendations for statewide curriculum guidelines. Once adopted, the state will decide the cost of the guidelines and allocate money to the districts accordingly. Asked what future aid levels might be, Dr. Klagholz said, "It depends what kind of solution we come up with."
That is cold comfort for most district superintendents, who find themselves caught between local taxpayer fatigue and Mrs. Whitman's pledge to cut state taxes and spending.
Asked how Glen Ridge in Essex County lost more than 13 percent in state school financing, Superintendent Stacy Holmes said, "That is a great question for the governor, not for me. It is a political choice among the districts."
Districts also criticized the state for indicating that some districts were getting what appeared to be large jumps in aid, complaining that those figures represent bookkeeping alterations from last year's budget rather than new money.
In Nutley, Dr. Votto, the superintendent, and Mr. Sincaglia, the business administrator, started poring over their proposed $31.2 million budget today line by line, looking for places to cut further.
They wondered aloud how much of a property tax increase they would have to ask from Nutley residents, who pay an average tax bill for schools of $2,700, Mr. Sincaglia said. They think voters are getting a little fed up with hearing on the one hand that they have an efficient school district where 94 percent of the students who took the high school test needed to graduate passed it on the first round. Then they are asked to pay even higher taxes.
"There is a resentment when you have done a good job in terms of efficiency and the results are good and then there is not really a reward," Dr. Votto said. "At least if we just knew the ground rules it would assist us in terms of planning."

HEADLINE: Fed's Decision to Lower Rates Advances Dow to 5,395.30

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market continued to demonstrate its strength yesterday after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point -- its third reduction since last July.
Stocks generally sold off in the morning, but turned upward once the Fed made its widely expected announcement around 2:15 P.M. The Dow Jones industrial average even spurted past the 5,400 level, just two days after reaching the 5,300 mark, before easing off to close at still another high of 5,395.30, up 14.09 points. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index followed up the previous session's record by advancing 5.87 points, to 636.02. The American Stock Exchange market value index gained 3.14, to 554.10, surpassing its earlier record of 553.58 set on Sept. 12. The Nasdaq composite index did not set a record, though it increased 8.49 points, to 1,059.79.
"The market confirmed a bullish scenario," said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer of the John Hancock Funds in Boston. "It was a good rally across-the-board."
Just as they had on Tuesday, advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange about doubled decliners; 1,560 stocks were up, and 804 stocks were down. Big Board volume amounted to 475.2 million shares, compared with 464.7 million shares the prior day.
Having already discounted much of the Fed's rate cut, bond yields edged slightly downward. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond slipped to 6.02 percent from 6.04 percent on Tuesday.
Banks, which usually benefit from lower rates, climbed yesterday. Citicorp rose 1 1/4, to 73 7/8; Wells Fargo increased 5 1/8, to 234 5/8; Mellon added 7/8, to 52 3/4, and BankAmerica advanced 2 1/4, to 67 3/8.
Insurance company stocks advanced amid a rise in premiums and a lessening of competition. AIG closed at 96 7/8, up 3 7/8; General Re closed at 53, up 5, and American General closed at 37 3/4, up 1.
With traders expecting greater economic growth in the months ahead, transportation issues rallied, pushing the Dow transportation average up 37.07 points, to 1,946.74. UAL, the parent of United Airlines, surged 2 3/8, to 161; AMR, the parent of American Airlines, increased 2 1/2, to 76; Delta Air Lines gained 1, to 68 3/8, and Northwest rose 2 3/16, to 45 1/8.
Tobacco stocks slumped at the end of the session, after a Florida court upheld the status of a liability action against cigarette manufacturers. RJR Nabisco fell 1 1/8, to 32 1/2, and Philip Morris dropped 2 1/4, to 92 3/4, even though it reported fourth-quarter profits above analysts' projections.
A number of special situations also finished on the down side. Datron Systems, which suffered from the cancellation of an $8.8 million order that forced it to restate its fiscal second-quarter profits, fell 3, to 13 1/2. Case, which was downgraded by Smith Barney, declined 1 3/8, to 47 3/8. Applied Digital Access, which said that its fourth-quarter net income dropped below analysts' estimates, gave up 1 1/4, to 14. And Jabil Circuit, which said that canceled orders would have a substantial effect on second-half earnings, plunged 3 1/4, to 6 3/8.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
China's Move On News Flow Worries U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Two weeks after China announced a broad plan to restrict the flow of news and economic information into China, the Clinton Administration said today that it would raise the subject in trade talks next week, the first indication that China's efforts to control Western news operations may soon become a new source of friction between the two countries.
"This is, of course, an issue of free speech and censorship, but it is also at the heart of our trade relationship," said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative. "We don't know how China plans to implement its restrictions, but clearly it is a step in the wrong direction." 
 While the Administration has chosen to treat China's restrictions, announced on Jan. 16, as an impediment to trade, Beijing clearly regards it as an issue of national security. The order was directed at the Reuters and Dow Jones news services, which are selling economic information and political news in China. They are now required to be supervised by the official New China News Agency, which will have control over the content of its news reports. The agency will also control their marketing to Chinese customers, which creates another trade problem: Dow Jones and Reuters are competing with the state press agency's own products.
Mr. Kantor said today that the wording of the restriction was so broad that American officials were uncertain how they would be applied. The announcement of the new regulations included the warning that "foreign economic information providers will be punished in accordance with the law if their released information to Chinese users contains anything forbidden by Chinese laws and regulations, or slanders or jeopardizes the national interests of China."
China regards all sorts of economic statistics as property of the state, and it has periodically prosecuted Chinese reporters for revealing classified economic data -- usually statistics considered routine in Japan, the United States and Europe. But it has never tried to do the same with foreign news organizations.
China's usual model in controlling information -- and other economic machinery -- is Singapore, the tightly controlled city-state whose economy, led by ethnic Chinese, has been one of the wonders of Asia. But even in Singapore, Western news is usually filtered for sexual or political content, not financial data.
Mr. Kantor said the restrictions would be raised next week in Beijing by Lee Sands, who directs the China desk of the trade representative's office. Putting the issue at Mr. Sands's level, a State Department official said today, "keeps this from getting too political, too ideological. By treating it as a trade barrier, we hope to keep the issue somewhat contained." Mr. Sands's chief mission is to press China for compliance with an agreement signed last year to protect American software, movies and videos from piracy.
The financial information business has been a booming one in China, with several news organizations attempting for the first time to sell data to Chinese securities houses, businesses and semigovernmental agencies. Some American officials have argued that the Chinese Government's restrictions will collapse of their own weight, once Chinese businesses begin to fall behind, because they cannot get up-to-date information on economic conditions.
But in the short term it could greatly limit trade with China, and it is particularly a threat to Hong Kong, over which China will regain control in July 1997. uHong Kong has always been the financial information center of Southeast Asia, and it is unclear whether the new Chinese restriction will apply there after it reverts to China's control.

HEADLINE: Toyota Plans Kentucky Site

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 1

 BODY:
The Toyota Motor Corporation will centralize supervision of its North American manufacturing operations at a new site in northern Kentucky, company and state officials said today.
The Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority approved an incentive package that could be worth up to $13.3 million in tax credits for the company in the coming decade. 
 A Toyota spokeswoman, Frances Champion, said Toyota would centralize supervision of purchasing, engineering and administration in northern Kentucky. She said sales, marketing and research would remain separate.
Reports here estimate that 500 or more employees will eventually work at the headquarters, which will be in the northern Kentucky suburbs of Cincinnati. An exact site has not yet been chosen.
Toyota makes passenger cars in Georgetown, Ky., and Cambridge, Ontario. It has a joint venture auto plant in Fremont, Calif., with General Motors.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
A Self-Effacing Avowal Of Geometry's Power

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
Given the space requirements of Sol LeWitt's wall drawings, New York probably will not see a full-scale survey of these cornerstones of Conceptualism any time soon. In the interim, the retrospective of the artist's prints at the Museum of Modern Art gives a superb if rather miniaturized account of his achievement and the remarkable way his art has unfolded over the last 25 years.
Mr. LeWitt belongs to that strain of 20th-century artist who has assiduously separated artistic value and beauty from material value. It includes predecessors like Kurt Schwitters, who worked with bits of twine and paper found in the street, and successors like Felix Gonzalez-Torres, who specialized in glittering piles of candy that were free for the taking. 
 Mr. LeWitt's contribution lies in a self-effacing brilliance: in the hazy beauty of his temporary wall drawings with their myriad lines and marks; in his refusal, in any medium, to value his hand over the hands of his assistants, and above all, in consistently giving ideas precedence over form in what is nonetheless a highly formal art.
Significantly, he can't lay any real claim to these ideas: the horizontal, the vertical and diagonal lines so basic to his work, for example, are simply geometry's first principles. Mr. LeWitt does little more than show that by repeating them carefully and in various combinations he can create visual edifices as complex as they are understandable. It is the direct line between cause and effect, between idea and action, that gives his art its power.
Mr. LeWitt realized early on that anything drawn on a wall could be condensed onto paper and that the refinement possible in different print media could yield a translation unusually accurate in scale and effect, with the paper forming a little wall of its own. For years he has given his wall motifs a second life in prints, investigating the special qualities of etching, aquatint and lithograph and figuring out ways, with his characteristic economy, to get the most out of each plate or stone.
In a suite of lithographs from 1971, for example, a squared-off mass of 10,000 freehand lines is multiplied by simply printing the stone four times, rotating it a quarter-turn for each impression to guarantee a maximum distributian of the marks.
The show, which includes some 200 prints from 1970 to the present, begins with the relatively simple configurations that characterized Mr. LeWitt's first wall drawings: repeating expanses of horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines, first in black and then in color, that the artist knit and reknit into grainy bands and blocks of texture and light.
By the mid-1970's the lines gained a life of their own, being freehand or often broken into short irregular marks. As in the wall drawings of the same period, the instructions determining a configuration often gave the draftsman certain formal choices, stressing the implicit collaborative nature of Mr. LeWitt's art. Or these instructions might become part of the image itself, as in a series of etching aquatints whose irregular star bursts consist of tilting lines piggybacked by the written directions determining their angle and length.
By the early 1980's, threa basic geometric shapes -- circle, square and cone -- often edged out the lines, and Mr. LeWitt adopted a subtle Mediterranean palette of rich rusts, blues and golds inspired by extended visits to Italy. (His wall drawings, now rendered in ink, became commensurately fresco-like.) In these works he introduced an extended family of often eccentric isometric forms, many of them derived from cubes, as certain prints reveal. In other images, the lines don't so much disappear as fatten into broad stripes: alternating bands of color that fill fields or define shapes.
In some of the best prints in recent years, the geometric shapes have shrunk to become the small planes of multifaceted, multicolored forms or, better still, angled fields that run edge to edge. Finally, in the artist's most recent efforts the lines are back, but this time they accumulate into freehand fields. Some have a looseness and dark veil-like quality reminiscent of Abstract Expressionism; others, in black and white, recapitulate the undulating patterns of Op Art.
Mr. LeWitt's motifs often evoke those of other geometrically inclined artists. Mel Bochner, Frank Stella, Robert Mangold and even Matisse come to mind at different points here, as do the more anonymous geometries of emblems, flags and charts. Predetermined and then simply executed by himself or others, Mr. LeWitt frequently ends up in vaguely familiar places, illuminating a complex terrain where form and thought overlap without being the least bit territorial.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Words Not Spoken

BYLINE: By A.M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
The Secretary of State worked hard polishing the speech. He wanted it to be his best, to sum up his vision of America's place in the world, particularly Asia.
And it did turn out to be the one speech that will always be associated with his career. It is remembered because of two words he did not speak. 
 On Jan. 12, 1950, Secretary Dean Acheson said that the American defensive perimeter -- plainly the areas where America would draw the line -- "runs along the Aleutians to Japan and then goes to the Ryukyus." The two words he left out were "South Korea" -- an ally constantly threatened by North Korea, a dependency of Communist China.
Six months later the North Koreans attacked the South -- and might have anyway. But American and Asian historians have generally believed that the omission of those two words helped convince the North Koreans that the U.S. would not do much about an attack on the South.
The speech has served for decades as a textbook case of how war can start by sliding over the threat and not stating what the price might be to the aggressor.
Once again, it seems to me, the U.S. is in danger of doing that -- this time about Communist China's maniacal threats of a war against Taiwan, 80 miles across the Straits.
Daily for months now, Beijing has threatened military attack against Taiwan. It says the leaders of Taiwan are plotting to make it independent of China. Beijing knows that top leaders of Taiwan plan no such thing.
But Taiwan did recently carry out the first free national election in the history of the Chinese people, and plans another in March. While not demanding independence, the Taiwan leadership does ask the world to acknowledge it as the separate thriving reality it has become.
For its freedoms and modest international ambitions, Beijing cannot forgive Taiwan, not until it surrenders its mind and future.
Beijing threatens naval blockade, and says missiles will fall every day in Taiwan. Already action has been added to threat -- missile "tests" near Taiwan and menacing amphibious landings opposite Taiwan.
To the U.S., which would inevitably become involved in a Chinese-started war that neither America nor Taiwan wants or incites, China offers the usual contempt. Beijing passes word that the U.S. is more interested in Los Angeles than Taiwan -- nasty nuclear blackmail. No country planning war ever delivered clearer threats than China against Taiwan.
The U.S. does caution Beijing. It says an attack on Taiwan would violate U.S. understandings with China and America's treaty with Taiwan. But it is done privately, without specifics about what the U.S. might do.
Washington believes the Chinese may be bluffing, and in any case will not make a direct land assault. But Beijing can easily carry out other attacks. Beijing and the American people should know what the U.S. might do if Beijing blockaded Taiwan or sank its ships or carried out daily missile raids. Would we reply in military proportion? Would we cut off the trade with China that finances the Chinese Army?
And can Beijing take America's whispered, unspecific cautions seriously if at the same time the U.S. helps strengthen the vast industrial empire of the Chinese Army, not only through trade but something called "defense conversion"?
The Far Eastern Economic Review reports that Defense Secretary Perry's plans for the Chinese to convert their arms and nuclear industries to civilian use have had only one tangible result -- "a lucrative business deal for Perry's friends and a springboard for China's efforts to develop a modern military-communications system." Representative Floyd D. Spence, chairman of the House Committee on National Security, has asked Mr. Perry for a reply.
Like other countries looking for trouble, China puts less credibility in another country's whispered cautions than it does in open statements about the cost to be paid.
So, as long as the U.S. gives neither China nor the American people an idea of what Washington might do to meet military action against Taiwan, it increases the possibility of war.
Giving advance warnings of consequences is not warmongering. As the Secretary of State and America found out 46 years ago, it is wiser and safer to say the words than to pencil them out.

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
A Paris-based real estate firm that deals in deluxe apartments closes its Manhattan office.

BYLINE: By Tracie Rozhon 

 BODY:
THE New York branch of Jean-Marc Levet, a real estate office that opened five years ago and quickly positioned itself as a seller of deluxe apartments, closed its 20-agent Manhattan operation last week.
At the same time, Brown Harris Stevens, an old-line real estate and property management firm that also prides itself on its top-drawer clients, said the president of Jean-Marc Levet/New York and 11 of its top salespeople would be joining Brown Harris. Brown Harris, which itself was acquired by a group of real estate professionals about a year ago, also said the company had negotiated a referral system with the Paris-based Jean-Marc Levet. 
 Owners of several of Manhattan's best-known real estate companies said they were not surprised by the shutdown. For them it was just another indication that medium-sized brokerage firms here were struggling.
"You have to have the economic muscle to survive," said Clark Halstead, head of the 200-agent company that bears his name. The Halstead Property Company itself acquired Carnegie Hill Properties and Edwards & Company, two smaller real estate companies, in the last four years.
Yet the closing of the Jean-Marc Levet office was notable because the firm specialized in the high end of the market, and the high end is by all accounts booming.
Executives at Jean-Marc Levet and Brown Harris said the problem was not a lack of sales -- 25 Levet closings are still scheduled and will go forward without interruption, they said -- but with the cost of doing business.
"You need the same kind of support systems, a very expensive computer network, a staff person spending all day inputting information into the computer and a receptionist," said Susan Greenfield Merdinger, president of Jean-Marc Levet's New York office. "And then there's the rent."
Ms. Merdinger said she closed out the firm's commercial operations in New York in January 1995, a little more than four years after opening the New York branch. At that time, she said, she hoped to expand the residential brokerage.
But the brokers she wanted to attract -- the top-end, top-selling brokers -- were reluctant to join the firm because she could not provide the advertising budgets and support services she said it would take to lure them. Over the last few years, Ms. Merdinger slashed her annual advertising budget of $130,000 in half.
She also tried to broaden her market, an effort she now says might have been a mistake. As she broadened the price range of apartments, the average selling price declined, from a high of $1.1 million to around $650,000 a week ago.
Ms. Merdinger also tried to renegotiate the $15,000-a-month rent, offering to move to smaller quarters in the firm's Park Avenue location, but she said the landlord had declined her offer.
"The lease ran to 2001," she said grimly. "We had $75,000 in escrow; we were really trapped into it."
She cut staff, laying off four secretarial/administrative people who made from $30,000 to $40,000 a year. Then the winter blahs set in: "In November and December of 1995, we hardly made a deal," she said, adding that the office could have gone on "for a while."
When she finally was told she could get out of her lease -- forfeiting her $75,000 deposit -- she said she decided to wind down the operations at a time when the pending sales would cover the firm's debts.
Ms. Merdinger called Brown Harris Stevens, now owned by a partnership that includes William L. and Arthur Zeckendorf and Kent Swig, scions of well-known real estate families. They recently acquired Brown Harris from the Helmsley Organization and since have been making a number of visible changes -- the move to an Upper East Side building they promptly christened the Brown Harris Stevens Building, for one -- as well as some costly, less visible technical systems changes.
Jean-Marc Levet in Paris and Brown Harris will each pay for referrals as they occur, he said, calling the referral plan a "back and forth" arrangement.
"We could have kept going," Ms. Merdinger said, "but I was tired, just very tired of the balancing act." Her title at Brown Harris is still being negotiated, she said, "but I have my own office, with a window."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gives Back Early Gains As a Key German Rate Isn't Cut

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against most leading currencies yesterday, giving back early gains on a day when Germany held its discount rate unchanged and bonds slumped in the United States.
While the Bundesbank did trim a key money-market rate, helping the dollar rise to a 20-week high against the mark in early New York trading, the central bank's decision not to cut its discount rate disappointed some investors. 
 "I think it would have been a sign of a concerted effort to bolster the dollar if they had cut, but they didn't," said Jim Raphael, currency trader at the National Westminster Bank in Jersey City. "We're always an inch away from really popping this thing."
Also, a slide in United States bonds, and caution before the release today of the employment report for January, kept investors from buying dollars aggressively yesterday, analysts said.
In New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.4875 marks, from 1.4891 marks on Wednesday. It finished at 106.75 yen, compared with 107.04 yen. The British pound rose to $1.5186 from $1.5122.
Speculation had mounted that the Bundesbank might cut the German discount rate yesterday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter-point on Wednesday. Lower rates in Europe often help the dollar by making deposits in the United States more attractive.
The dollar has already risen 3.5 percent against the mark this year after a cut in the German discount rate in December and recent cuts to the 14-day securities repurchase rate, the chief money-market rate.
It may take some fresh news to push the dollar above 1.50 marks, a psychologically important level. On Sept. 14, the dollar briefly pushed through, reaching a seven-month high of 1.5048 marks, before turning lower.
"1.50 is a big psychological level for the dollar to overcome," said Michael Perelstein, who manages $11 billion in global bonds for the MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation.
The dollar held some of its gains against the Swiss franc after the Swiss National Bank director, Jean Zwahlen, said that the Swiss currency was "clearly too high," and that he expected it to depreciate. The Swiss currency has already slid 5.3 percent against the dollar this year.The dollar settled yesterday at 1.2145 Swiss francs, up from 1.2122 Swiss francs on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: The Republican Welfare Trap

 BODY:
House Republicans have a plan to corner President Clinton politically. They want to pass the Senate's welfare reform bill, which is less extreme than the House bill but still nasty. No matter what he does, someone will accuse the President of betraying his promises. If he signs the bill he will, by his staff's estimates, throw more than a million children into poverty and infuriate his party's liberal wing. If he vetoes it, the G.O.P. will accuse him of repudiating not only his campaign promise to reform the welfare system but also his grudging embrace of the Senate bill when it passed by an overwhelming majority in September. That mistake has returned to haunt him. 
 Mr. Clinton's choice -- alienating moderates who were won over by his campaign promises or enraging liberal advocates of the current system -- would be unenviable for any politician, let alone a Democrat running for re-election. His best course of action is the right course. That is to admit that his earlier embrace of the Senate plan, which Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York has justifiably described as "an obscene act of social regression," was wrong. He should then veto it or any other bill that rips holes in the nation's 60-year-old safety net.
The Senate bill would end the system under which Washington guarantees to match state contributions to poor mothers with children. That historic entitlement has not only encouraged states to provide adequate benefits. It has also cushioned economic downturns by pumping cash into needy hands.
In addition, the bill would allow states to opt out of the food stamp program -- the only Federal program that sets a uniform standard of relief for everyone in the country. The measure would cut off legal, taxpaying immigrants from food stamps and other help and fall $12 billion short of the money needed to achieve what the Republicans insist is their ultimate goal -- putting welfare recipients to work. The truth is that finding jobs for welfare mothers requires child care, training and transportation -- expenses that dwarf the cost of sending them a check. The Republicans simply duck the financial realities.
Lost in this catfight is the fact that the nation already has a pretty good welfare law, the Family Support Act of 1988. The major problem is that Congress never put nearly enough money behind the law's welfare-to-work provisions to make them function. Senate Democrats previously proposed doing just that. Mr. Clinton's welfare reform bill went even further -- imposing time limits on welfare, which the Republicans favor, but also providing money for child care, job training and, as a last resort, a public-sector job for parents who try without success to find private-sector work. Once the Republicans took control of Congress, these worthwhile bills were dead.
Mr. Clinton was forced to backtrack. But his rhetorical concessions in September, when the Senate voted 87 to 12 for the Republican bill, went much too far. He was petrified at the prospect of walking into November as a defender of the current welfare system. No Democratic President ought to accept a bill that would tear down the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt.
Fortunately, the mood on Capitol Hill has changed. Newt Gingrich is flying closer to the ground. Voters are dissatisfied with the hard edges of the Republican agenda. There is a fighting chance that Mr. Clinton can keep faith with the traditional liberal base of his party without alienating the middle-class voters who, in 1992, resonated to his promise to "end welfare as we know it." Mr. Clinton can take the risk of vetoing a measure he knows is harsh and punitive.

HEADLINE: The Fate of Colombia's Leader

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Feb. 1

 BODY:
This week, in a special session of Congress called by President Ernesto Samper to weigh accusations that he had solicited millions of dollars in drug money for his campaign, many of the politicians who could ultimately impeach him gave Mr. Samper a standing ovation after his opening speech.
The show of support was a vivid reminder that, after a week of denunciations from one-time allies and resignations by diplomats and ministers, Mr. Samper is by no means ready to be written into history. 
 Simply by convening Congress to debate his fate, Mr. Samper knew he was selecting an ethically compromised, and therefore sympathetic, forum, said Rudolf Hommes, rector of Los Andes University and a former Finance Minister. Congress itself has been rife with corruption, and roughly 40 Congressmen from Mr. Samper's Liberal Party are plagued by campaign financing scandals of their own, said Mr. Hommes.
As evidence against him has grown, with Fernando Botero, his former campaign manager, implicating him last week from prison, Mr. Samper quickly shifted the debate to the political arena from the judicial one.
On Tuesday, the first day of the special session and weeks before Congress was expected to even begin hearing evidence from the Chief Prosecutor, Alfonso Valdivieso Sarmiento, the mechanisms to ease the President's worries appeared to be in place.
Heyne Mogollon, whose Committee of Accusations has already cleared the President of any wrongdoing, said he would continue as chairman while the congressional committee studies the new evidence. Mr. Mogollon said the fact that he himself is under investigation by the Supreme Court, accused of neglecting to pursue the evidence the prosecutor presented to the committee, did not disqualify him from considering the case against the President.
The podium largely belongs to Mr. Samper's Liberal Party supporters and a disorganized opposition that includes an essentially silent Conservative Party.
Two Conservative Senators began a hunger strike on Wednesday to demand that a new Committee of Accusations be appointed, but they are acting as individuals, not as part of any organized party effort. In fact, the badly fractured Conservatives have no plans to participate in the political debate in Congress, though individual members of the party said they disagreed with this stance.
Further, Mr. Samper has already shown he may hang on to power despite losing the support of business leaders and the media, once considered vital to his survival.
What the business leaders fear most is losing the economic cooperation that comes with the annual certification of Colombia by the United States Congress as an ally in the fight against drug trafficking. But even the business sector appears to be adjusting to a new equilibrium. This week, in a demonstration of their doubts about Mr. Samper's ability to win over Washington, a group of business leaders flew to Washington to lobby Congress directly for certification.
Decertification would mean Colombia would lose all United States aid that is not tied to fighting drugs.
Last year, the United States Government gave Colombia a special certification based on "national interest," and the business leaders apparently feared Colombia could do far worse this year.
Mr. Samper's hand was also strengthened by a letter signed by several previous presidents of Colombia, who emphasized the importance of the political mandate granted the President upon his election.
And though Mr. Samper himself said he would avoid his own Congress during the time it considered the evidence against him, his Interior Minister, Horacio Serpa, was expected to work energetically to build support for him within Congress.
Enrique Gomez, a Conservative Senator, said he believed Mr. Samper called the special session as a means to fan the threat of instability as the prosecutor prepares to present the case against him and Congress weighs whether or not to recommend prosecution. Because the prosecutor, Mr. Valdivieso, enjoys enormous credibility among Colombians, a recommendation from him that Mr. Samper be prosecuted would be nearly impossible for Congress to disregard.
"The strategy of the Government is to heat up the atmosphere, to polarize the rich against the poor, the gringos against the Colombians, the Conservatives against the Liberals," said Senator Gomez, whose brother, Alvaro Gomez, was assassinated on a Bogota street last fall. "I think this is a very dangerous regime."
"They haven't any moral barriers, and they don't have the national interest at heart," he added.
Senator Hugo Serrano, a Liberal, said he expected strong support for the President, despite rumblings that a group of Liberals would withdraw support for him. "With the evidence we have seen, I think the President will do well with Congress," said Mr. Serrano.
In the face of the Conservatives' above-the-fray position, Mr. Samper's speech to the special session was, some observers said, his most forceful since he was elected. "It was very direct, and it responded to every one of the sectors that have attacked him -- the prosecutor, the business leaders, journalists, other politicians," said Juan Tokatlian, a columnist for El Tiempo.
Manuel Hernandez, a professor at Los Andes University, said that after the speech, he upped his private estimate of Mr. Samper's chances of survival from one in four to one in three. Mr. Hommes, the former Finance Minister, said he believed Mr. Samper had an almost even chance of finishing out his term.
Mr. Samper has managed to fend off aggressive reporting by the media and requests from business leaders that he resign by portraying himself as a populist under siege for his commitment to the poor -- indirectly playing on the fear of chaos that terrifies Colombians, rich and poor.
"I think that last week he was very weak," Mr. Hommes said. "Then he scared the establishment by threatening a class struggle, saying he would get the poor people on his side, and they relaxed the pressure."
"I would expect an acquittal, unless the prosecutor brings overwhelming evidence, but in this type of case most of the evidence is of the hearsay type," said Mr. Hommes. "The question is whether the Colombian public is now convinced whether he should stay or not."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long Bond Down Ahead Of Refunding

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday after the modest rises of Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates.
Longer-term maturities slumped; the 30-year bond was down 23/32 , to 111, and the yield rose to 6.07 percent, from 6.02 percent on Wednesday. 
 Traders had to deal with conflicting signals. The economic news of the day included a weak manufacturing report and a smaller rise than expected in consumer prices, indicating to traders that the decline in interest rates was far from over. All this was good news for the market, which hopes for further cuts from the Fed.
But investors seemed more concerned about a rise in commodity prices, particularly in gold, which suggest that inflationary pressures are building.
Thomas E. Donne, vice president and a senior portfolio manager for Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, takes another view, however. "People looking at commodities and gold as precursors of inflation have too narrow a focus," he said. "Gold is safe haven for lots of investors who don't play the bond market, so there are a lot of reasons it is up, but bonds and the economy are not among them."
Mr. Donne said that yesterday's consumer price report meant that 1995 was "the first time since the mid-60's that we've seen price increases below 3 percent for four straight years."
Everything that should have been supporting the market yesterday did not, including the cut in the Federal funds and discount rates, a tiny rise in the core producer price data and prospects for further Fed easing.
So what was wrong with the market?
Mr. Donne pointed out that this is a political year, and people are still leery of the budget talks. The short end of the market from five-year maturities and down has responded well to the fundamental data, he said, but the long end is influenced by the supply of new issues that will be coming to market the rest of the year. And then, he continued, "there are conflicting signals coming out of the commodities market."
"Beside, people have made a lot of money in last few days," Mr. Donne added, "and with the employment number due tomorrow, some participants would want to take profits."
Yesterday, the Treasury sold $18.75 billion of new one-year bills, at an average rate of 4.64 percent, down from 4.89 percent last month and the lowest since March 1994, when it was 4.30 percent.
Traders said the sale drew strong investor demand, particularly from small investors. Shorter maturities have been in high demand on expectations of more Fed easings.
Next week, the Treasury will hold its quarterly refunding, totaling $44.5 billion, with the sale of three-year notes on Tuesday, 10-year notes on Wednesday and 30-year bonds on Thursday. The Thursday sale will include an additional $8 billion of 7-day cash management bills.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the three-year notes were offered at a price to yield 5.02 percent; the 10-year notes, 5.96 percent, and the 30-year bonds, 6 percent.
Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston, said the market's tone remained healthy with a background of diminishing inflation pressures. The National Association of Purchasing Management index, which gauges anticipated business activity, fell to 44.2 percent for January. Mr. Alexy said that showed how weak the economy was. He added that over the last 40 years, the index has been that low only eight times. With that weakness, he believes that the quarter-point reduction in short-term rates was not enough.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new one-year bills:

Buchanan Vows an America-First Policy

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H., Feb. 1

 BODY:
Battling for third place in New Hampshire's Republican Presidential primary, Patrick J. Buchanan promised an America-first policy today, vowing to make sure the "new world order comes crashing down."
In a spirited speech to the New Hampshire Legislature, Mr. Buchanan railed against the United Nations, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization for usurping the United States' sovereignty. 
 "I give my word. I know that those folks in Tokyo, New York, Paris, Bonn, Brussels -- they love this idea of world government. But if I am elected President of the United States, the minute I raise my hand to take that oath of office that new world order comes crashing down," he said.
Mr. Buchanan said that the polls showed that New Hampshire was "wide open," and he is intent on being the most conservative in the field.
While he still trails Senator Bob Dole and Steve Forbes in polls here, Mr. Buchanan broke into double digits this week and now appears to lead the rest of the pack.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: IN THE PACK;
Lugar Struggles to Revive Campaign

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: HAWARDEN, Iowa, Feb. 1

 BODY:
The small group of voters gathered in the library of the local high school listened respectfully but seemingly without great enthusiasm as Senator Richard G. Lugar outlined his views on a tax overhaul, gun control, illegal immigration and abortion. But when the subject changed to agriculture, things perked up.
Jokes and barbs were exchanged as Mr. Lugar and his audience discussed target prices for grain, pork exports to Asia, corn futures and Mr. Lugar's own 604-acre farm in Indiana. 
 "It's not a hobby farm," Mr. Lugar said with pride. "We make money every year. We take it very seriously."
Accounting for about 20 percent of Iowa's employment, farmers and workers in farm-related industries are a major force in the state's economy as well as in its politics. And, as was evident in a recent campaign swing through Des Moines and northwest Iowa, including this small town and Sioux City, Mr. Lugar is hoping to tap into the farm vote to help lift his flagging campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination.
While Congress this week is debating a farm bill that would gradually eliminate many of the Government's agriculture subsidy programs, few of the Republican candidates, with the exception of Mr. Lugar and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, have had much to say about farm issues.
When asked why agriculture issues have taken a back seat in this year's campaign, Mr. Lugar said in an interview: "None of the other candidates even have a slight familiarity with the issues. Agriculture issues are very complex, and farmers here are very sophisticated people. They understand better than most all the complexities. I supposed the other candidates would be reduced to saying, Let the free market work or I'm against controls or some other bromide of that variety."
Mr. Lugar is chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and his role in setting farm policy will be on display this week as he pushes the farm bill, which is scheduled for a Senate vote this week. The bill would end most farm subsidies over seven years, would allow farmers to plant more acres and would give them more of a choice of what they can plant. It is very popular among most farm groups in Iowa.
But as has been the case for much of the Senator's campaign, whatever his views and accomplishments might be on agriculture, Mr. Lugar's message is being drowned out in a sea of television commercials promoting other candidates, most notably Steve Forbes and his plan for a flat tax.
"I still have that fundamental problem," Mr. Lugar said. "They need to know that we're there."
Even on tax issues, Mr. Lugar's message is not reaching much of an audience. He has proposed a plan that is much more radical than Mr. Forbes's flat tax: replacing the current income tax system with a national sales tax. But given Mr. Forbes's lavish advertising campaign, Mr. Lugar's idea has not been part of the debate.
"For $10 million to $20 million, I could popularize my idea, too," Mr. Lugar said on Tuesday at the Iowa Pork Producers convention in Des Moines. "The reason the flat tax is generally more popular is that it's been marketed with extraordinary multiples of any other policy that I have seen in the campaign."

HEADLINE: Audit Says U.S. Capital Remains in Deep Fiscal Crisis Despite Drop in Deficit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
In a city where people wait endlessly for snowplows to clear their streets, police officers sell baked goods to raise money for office supplies, and more than half of the city's 16 firetrucks are out of commission, another reminder of economic tough times was hardly needed. But today, residents of the nation's capital learned just how bleak the city had become.
An audit for the 1995 fiscal year showed that while Washington had substantially reduced its deficit spending, it remains a city in deep fiscal crisis, with its tax base shrinking as thousands of residents move to the suburbs. The audit showed that the city's deficit had reached more than $378.5 million and was expected to grow by as much as $260 million in the 1996 fiscal year. 
 Further, the report found that sloppy and illegal management practices were rampant in the city's agencies. The auditors said that at least four agencies, including schools and human services, had violated a Federal law that prohibits an agency from exceeding its appropriated budget.
"We significantly reduced the deficit for one year," Mayor Barry said at a news conference, focusing on the one encouraging result of the audit, a drop to $54.5 million in deficit spending for 1995 from $335.4 million in the previous year. "It might not seem like any progress to some, but to us it seems like a great deal of progress in the trend of government."
While the Mayor pointed to the declining deficit as proof that city officials are responding to the dictates of the Republican-controlled Congress and a financial control board appointed last year by President Clinton, the audit showed that Mr. Barry's administration still had far to go to achieve a balanced budget by 1999, as required by law.
Chief among what the Mayor called the report's "disturbing news" was evidence that tax revenue in the District of Columbia declined by more than $11 million last year, a drop reflecting not only a reduction in property tax rates but also the steady exodus of people annoyed with poor public services and questionable public safety. Last month the Census Bureau said 13,000 people moved out of Washington in 1995, reducing the population to 554,000, its lowest in 66 years.
The audit showed that the city had assets of $890 million and liabilities of $1.3 billion; thus, more than $400 million in bills could not be paid.
Mr. Barry blamed the decline in the size of the Federal Government, the city's largest employer, for part of the disparity. But with Congress resistent to the idea of a commuter tax, he offered no ideas of how to increase revenue.
While many city agencies heeded calls to cut spending and the number of employees, the report showed that some agencies, including the schools, moved in the opposite direction. The school system, which is cited by many former District residents as their reason for leaving, exceeded its budget by almost $13.2 million.
"The city has been dragging its feet in all areas," said Stephen D. Harlan, vice chairman of the control board, expressing the board's view that the city has not made enough cuts. "They can't go through denial anymore. It's time to say, 'We have a problem; let's fix the problem.' "
The other disturbing aspect of the report was the finding that some city employees had violated laws and regulations. Auditors found six cases in which checks were written to city contractors who had Internal Revenue Service liens against them, 42 instances in which court mandates were violated and six cases of "contract splitting" to evade regulations.
The auditors detailed cases in which city employees violated environmental regulations and made $60 million in purchases without the full amount of the contract being recorded.
They also cited examples of outmoded computer systems, inadequate security for the systems, redundant data entry by different agencies and shoddy maintenance. Describing computer centers at D.C. General Hospital, the auditors said they found one area where computers were kept in a condemned building where "water leaks into the room, causing ceiling tile and wall plaster to fall on the equipment."
Mr. Barry brushed such examples aside, saying, "All those things have been known about." He said he was appointing a panel to study the concerns raised by the audit and to offer some solutions within 30 days.
Instead, he saved his criticism for the control board, which has not approved his proposal for cutting an additional $150 million from the city's $4.99 billion budget for 1996 because it has been caught up in the overall budget impasse in Congress.
Mr. Harlan, who called the plan "absolutely senseless" because it included not paying $100 million in old Medicare bills, said the board's alternative approach would be ready soon.
"I've done all I can to work with the board," Mayor Barry said, showing his reluctance to cut the number of city employees any more. "But it's not as reciprocal as it should be."

HEADLINE: China, Vying With Taiwan, Explores Public Relations

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Last November, representatives from the communications firm of Robinson Lerer Sawyer Miller were invited to the Chinese Embassy to present an ambitious three-year public-relations strategy for Beijing.
Focus on "hot-button issues" like human rights and weapons sales, the Chinese were told, according to people familiar with the day-long presentation. Put on a road show of Chinese athletes during the summer Olympics. Create a "command center" to handle crises. Set up a news bureau with television links and an on-line information system. The firm boasted that it operated "well behind the scenes" and represented corporate giants like Microsoft and Chrysler and the Governments of countries like the Philippines, Columbia, Chile and Indonesia. 
 The Chinese listened politely and thanked their guests. Officials at the firm say they have not heard back since.
Given China's historic suspicion of outside interference, the encounter was highly unusual, as were China's tentative overtures to other American lobbying firms. The search for a hired gun was part of an awkward effort to defeat Taiwan -- not with a missile attack across the Taiwan Strait, but with a public relations campaign in the United States.
On this battlefield, however, even a nuclear power of 1.2 billion people and the fastest-growing economy in the world is no match for a small island of 20 million inhabitants that has assiduously worked Washington for decades.
"It's hard to think of anybody who does this kind of thing worse," said Stanley Roth, director of studies at the U.S. Institute for Peace, who was the senior Asia specialist at the White House until last month. "The Chinese come in and tell you what they want to do and you're supposed to say 'good.' They are not willing to compete in the realm of ideas nor do they recognize that the key to lobbying is education over time."
But ever since the Clinton Administration bent to Congressional pressure and allowed President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan to visit the United States last summer, the Chinese have seemed determined to sell their message better.
President Jiang Zemin has admitted the need for China to develop its skills in dealing with other nations, telling U.S. News and World report last year: "We have not developed the practice of picking up the phone and saying 'hello' to President Clinton. I think we need to improve this. We certainly haven't done enough lobbying of the U.S. Congress."
Late last year, according to press reports, the Chinese created an entity called the "Central Leading Working Group on the U.S. Congress," which reports indirectly to Mr. Jiang and whose mandate is to study and understand Capitol Hill. But the group is either so low-profile or so new that even China specialists at the Central Intelligence Agency and James Sasser, the newly confirmed American Ambassador to China, know nothing about it.
To help burnish their image, the Chinese are pressing members of Congress to visit and treating them like heads of state when they come.
Last month, when three Democratic senators -- Diane Feinstein of California, John Glenn of Ohio and Sam Nunn of Georgia -- visited Beijing, President Jiang showed them Mao's bedroom, billard room and indoor swimming pool, telling them that they were the first foreigners to step foot in that part of the palace since the Chinese leader died.
But when it came to the tough policy issues that divide the two countries -- like Taiwan, human rights and missile sales to Pakistan -- Mr. Jiang and his subordinates turned tone deaf, Senator Glenn said.
When Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu, China's top specialist on the United States, suggested during one meeting that Congress not bring up anything negative about the relationship between the two countries during the election year, the Senator lost his patience.
"I told him 'You just don't understand our form of government if you think anybody could tell a particular Congressmen or Senator not to bring up something about China,' " Senator Glenn said. "We're not that kind of country. China has a few top leaders who decide what the country is going to do and it happens. In our country, every individual is a king."
That exchange underscores why China experts, businessmen and lawmakers like Senator Feinstein, who has emerged as a chief defender of China on Capitol Hill, have begun to urge the Chinese to look to Taiwan as an example of how to mold American public opinion.
Even though the United States Government considers Taiwan part of China (its diplomats cannot even enter the State Department), its lobbying efforts have led 24 states to pass resolutions to treat Taiwan like any other country.
Taiwan has 13 regional offices to push cultural and trade ties; it buys good will with donations to universities and first-class trips to Taiwan for Congressional staff members, rotary clubs, state legislators and veterans groups. As Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton visited Taiwan four times; he has never visited the People's Republic of China.
The Chinese are well aware that Taiwan is paying $4.5 million over three years to the Washington lobbying firm of Cassidy & Associates, which helped get President Lee a visa last year.
"I say to the Chinese you have a lot to learn here," said Robert Kapp, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. "I say to them, 'America is not a mystery.' I say to them, 'If you're going to talk to Congress, you have to talk the talk and walk the walk.' "
Among his specific advice is for the Chinese to assign younger people with strong language skills to reach out to Congress, state legislatures and the American people.
Although China's Ambassador, Li Daoyu, gives an occasional speech and makes an occasional trip to Capitol Hill, his embassy keeps an exceptionally low profile. The only time many American journalists step foot inside the embassy is trick-or-treating with their children at Halloween.
When Lu Wenxiang, the ever-polite embassy spokesman, was asked to comment on China's efforts to reach out, he said he would call back. He did not.
The Chinese can expect to get some help with Congress from Ambassador Sasser, who spent 18 years in the Senate and pledged during his confirmation hearings last October to have "as many senators as possible" visit him in Beijing.
"Part of my role is going to be -- how should I say it -- to more fully inform the Chinese of the importance of good relations with the U.S. Congress and of the way our Government functions," said Mr. Sasser, who leaves for Beijing on Saturday.
A few months ago, China sent out tentative feelers to several leading public relations and lobbying firms, but has yet to proceed with serious negotiations, a number of China specialists said.
One of those approached was Fleischman-Hillard, Inc., whose clients include Sony and MasterCard and the governments of Angola and Turkey, and which already has a trade office in Beijing. The company had presented the Chinese with a plan to promote American trade and investment, and has talked to independent China experts about developing a public-relations proposal for Beijing, according to people familiar with the company's activities.
For now, the single best lobbyist on behalf of China is probably former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, who is not paid by China but who advises American companies doing business there. Mr. Kissinger's meetings with Speaker Newt Gingrich last year led him to back off his call for Taiwan's independence.
But even Mr. Kissinger's efforts have not been enough to make Mr. Gingrich a friend of China.
Just last Saturday, in a town meeting outside of Atlanta, Mr. Gingrich warned of a future nuclear threat from "China or Iran or Korea or some place like that," adding that an angry China might some day decide to launch a missile at Los Angeles.

Crisis or Not, Shadow of 70's Haunts Budget

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
HANG onto your old Bee Gees records. Don't throw out those Annie Hall clothes. It may be time to brush up on Watergate trivia and to dust off that copy of "Shogun."
The 1970's are back. 
 Even though that may not be readily apparent in pop culture, it is growing hard to escape that notion after a glance at Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's latest budget plan. There is an old expression for the present state of municipal finances, and it comes straight out of the 1970's: fiscal crisis.
Shhh! They don't want to hear that at City Hall. Crisis? What crisis?
Officials there describe the big imbalance between expenses and revenues as an opportunity to "reinvent government" and to do so without inflicting serious pain on the public. Any comparison with the crisis of two decades ago is out of line, the officials say. They do have a point. In the mid-1970's, the city teetered close to bankruptcy and could not borrow money, ultimately turning control over its finances to an assortment of outside monitors. Nothing now is that bad.
But no word leaps to mind faster than "crisis" in a city that now finds, even after several years of retrenchment, that it has five months to close holes totaling $2.8 billion in the budget. In three years, the gap is expected to exceed $4 billion. A billion here and a billion there, and, as Everett M. Dirksen used to say, pretty soon you're talking about real money.
"The crisis is definitely there and hitting us again," said Robert R. Kiley, president of the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce. "It could still come back in the form that it did 20 years ago, with ratings agencies telling the city that it's no longer credit worthy."
Stephen R. Berger, who was one of those outside monitors in the 1970's, adds that "structural changes" were never made that would keep New York solvent for good, and not just for months at a time. "What we didn't do on that in 1975 is coming back to haunt us," Mr. Berger said, noting parenthetically that he objects to the word "crisis" because it suggests an aberration while the city's money troubles are "a permanent condition."
In presenting his preliminary budget on Wednesday in a colonnaded hearing room at City Hall, Mr. Giuliani was remarkably upbeat for a man with a financial plan that may have more holes than the Jets' offensive line. He spoke with confidence, even occasional humor. There was something reassuring about this manner. Who wants a leader with the dank air of panic about him?
But that brave front did not erase doubts about his gap-closing suggestions, notably their reliance on one-shot measures like the sale of WNYC-TV and revenue assumptions that are far from bankable -- $244 million in airport rent from the Port Authority, to name one. And despite the Mayor's observations about how the New York economy is bouncing back, the revival is far from solid enough to keep his budget balanced without some legerdemain.
IN fact, the way he accentuated the positive brought a faint reminder of (shades of the '70's again) former Gov. Hugh L. Carey. In his day, Mr. Carey liked to get up in public and belt out the signature song from "Annie." Mr. Giuliani seems too restrained for such a display. But it might do him some good once in a while to offer up a resounding chorus of "The sun will come out tomorrow." Who knows? The sun just might come out.
More likely, the fiscal darkness will linger, deepened by a further closing of the city's favorite cash-dispensing machines, better known as Washington and Albany. Even if the Mayor's fellow Republicans capture the White House along with Congress, it is hard to see much fiscal good in it for New York, especially if Bob Dole wins. Mr. Giuliani has not embraced the Senate leader's candidacy, and one can imagine a recasting of a Daily News headline that became an instant classic in the mid-1970's. The new version:
DOLE TO CITY: DROP DEAD
Still, if the next few months really go wrong, the Mayor has a way out. He could almost balance the budget simply by abandoning his proposed tax cuts. He would resist that step, of course. Tax reductions are a pillar of his philosophy of governance.
But his hands may be tied. In opposition to Mr. Giuliani, the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, already insists on retaining a 12.5 percent income-tax surcharge to finance a school-rebuilding program.
On Wednesday, someone asked Mr. Vallone how he hoped to persuade the Mayor to go along.
"We'll make him an offer he can't refuse," the Speaker replied with a smile.
There's that echo of the 1970's again. Maybe it's time, too, to start humming the theme from "The Godfather."

HEADLINE: Prices in 1995 Up 2.5%, a 5th Subdued Year

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Signaling that inflation has been vanquished to a degree not seen since the early 1960's, the Labor Department reported today that consumer prices rose only 2.5 percent for all of 1995, the lowest rate in nearly a decade and the fifth consecutive year that inflation held to about 3 percent or less.
Most economists toasted the news, saying that they expected the inflation rate to remain just as low in 1996 or to dip further. They said that this period of price stability, one of the longest since World War II, would give the Federal Reserve enough room to keep cutting interest rates, as it did on Wednesday, to spark a slowing economy. 
 For cautious Fed governors, the latest inflation figure was "certainly music to their ears," said David Orr, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C.
But a few other economists warned that wage increases and other pressures could start to rekindle inflation this year, should the Fed continue to lower interest rates.
"The day that the central bank declares victory over inflation is the day that the forces of reinflation commence," Steven S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley, said.
Still, Government figures show clearly that inflation has not been so tame for so long since the Administration of John F. Kennedy and into the early years of Lyndon B. Johnson's Presidency, when it averaged 1.3 percent from 1961 through 1965.
Moreover, there are no wars or economic shocks on the horizon like the oil-supply cutbacks of the 1970's. Even health costs, a nemesis to inflation fighters in the 1980's and early 1990's, rose in 1995 at just 3.9 percent, the slowest rate in 23 years, the report showed.
The overall inflation rate of 2.5 percent last year followed 2.7 percent in both 1994 and 1993, 2.9 percent in 1992 and 3.1 percent in 1991.
It was also the lowest overall rate since the 1.1 percent recorded when oil prices plunged in 1986, the only other year since the mid-1960's in which inflation fell to less than 3 percent.
Given that many economists believe that the Government's index of consumer prices tends to overstate true inflation by anywhere from half a percentage point to a whole point, "essentially no inflation is showing up now," said Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Lehman Brothers.
Mr. Sinai noted that consumer prices rose only two-tenths of 1 percent in December despite a temporary jump in energy prices. He also said it was remarkable that the overall rate could be so low nearly five years into a period of expansion, which, in economists' terms, began in March 1991.
Mr. Sinai said he thought that the inflation rate would remain at 2.5 percent this year, or even to dip a bit lower. If that is the case, he said, the Federal Reserve should have enough maneuvering room to trim short-term interest rates by perhaps another half a percentage point in the next several months.
Led by the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Open Market Committee -- made up of the Federal Reserve Board's five governors and some of its regional bank presidents -- lowered the Federal funds rate, the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans, by a quarter-point on Wednesday, to 5.25 percent. It also lowered the discount rate, which the Fed charges on its own loans to banks, by a quarter-point, to 5 percent. In a statement, the central bank said it was responding to "moderating economic expansion."
The Fed's key committee also said that the slowdown in the economy had "reduced potential inflationary pressures going forward." Its statement described inflation as being "already subdued" and "contained."
But it made clear that Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues still felt that they had to maintain a delicate balance: nudging the economy along without letting inflation get out of control.
Adding to the difficulty, some economists say, is that it is not clear just how much the economy has slowed in recent months, or how much stimulation it can absorb without increasing inflation.
Nearly every indicator released in recent weeks has showed that the economy is weakening, and a report released today by the National Association of Purchasing Management reinforced the concerns.
That group's composite index, which measures the strength of manufacturing industries, fell in January for the sixth straight month, to a reading of 44.2 from 46 in December. Economists normally regard readings of less than 50 as evidence that the economy could be headed for a recession.
Most economists estimate that growth slid to a rate of about 2 percent in 1995's fourth quarter from a robust 3.2 percent in the previous quarter. Many fear that mounting consumer debts and disruptions from recent snowstorms have pushed economic growth as low as an annualized 1 percent so far in 1996, and some say that the Fed may ultimately have to cut the Federal funds rate to as low as 4 percent to stave off a recession.
But other economists doubt that the growth rate has dropped that far. Some, like Mr. Roach of Morgan Stanley, think that the economy remains healthy enough for growth to rebound as high as an annual 2.5 percent to 3 percent by the second half of 1996 without further interest-rate cuts.
In the end, though, what happens with inflation could hinge, as usual, on the economy's ability to create jobs.
The national unemployment rate held steady at the end of last year at 5.6 percent. Most economists expect that to edge up to 5.7 percent, in a report scheduled to be released on Friday.
The number of people filing first-time claims for unemployment insurance recently reached a six-month high of 413,000 people, though the Labor Department reported today that the total had dropped by 25,000 last week.
But to inflation hawks like Mr. Roach, if the Fed continues to cut interest rates to keep unemployment from worsening, "we may look back on this period as having been the low point in the inflationary cycle."
He said that pressures from wage increases were slowly mounting and that recent rises on commodities markets suggested that food prices could increase much more than the scant one-tenth of 1 percent reported in December.
As a result, Mr. Roach said he thought that consumer prices could rise by as much as 3.25 percent in 1996.
"That would still be a terrific inflation result for the United States," he said. But he noted, "I am concerned that the Fed could be adding fuel to an economy that could be doing a lot better right now than it seems to be."

HEADLINE: Bronx Election Pits 2 Families;
Outcome Could Establish A New Political Dynasty

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
The two candidates have a striking amount in common. Both are young -- 22 years old -- and pursuing college degrees. Both are politically ambitious. Both have fathers who gained prominence in Hispanic politics in New York City.
But what is drawing keen interest in political circles about the Feb. 15 special election for a vacant State Assembly seat in the South Bronx is that both candidates have the potential to establish something new to the city's political landscape: a Puerto Rican political dynasty. 
 When Assemblyman Hector Diaz announced last month that he would step down to become the new Bronx County Clerk, several candidates stepped forward. But the field has since narrowed to two: Pedro Gautier Espada, the son of State Senator Pedro Espada Jr., and Ruben Diaz Jr., the son of the Rev. Ruben Diaz, the Pentecostal minister and three-time political candidate.
Throughout New York City's political history, there has never been a shortage of family dynasties, from the Wagners of Manhattan and O'Dwyers of Brooklyn to the Molinaris of Staten Island. In more recent years, black politicians have started to take part, with the Patersons in Harlem and the Townses in Brooklyn.
So many politicians contend that the race for the Assembly seat, a race widely nicknamed the Battle of the Juniors, symbolizes not only the changing face of politics in the Bronx but also a coming of age of sorts for Hispanic political life in New York.
"In New York, we have seen other immigrant groups going through generations of people running for office," said Luis A. Miranda Jr., president of the Hispanic Federation of New York City, an umbrella organization of 58 service groups. "Now, we are seeing the same phenomenon among Puerto Ricans. The second and third generations are growing up and gaining a foothold in politics in New York."
Symbolism notwithstanding, this is widely viewed as a bare-knuckles political bout with both candidates tapping some formidable resources. Mr. Espada comes with the backing of the Bronx Democratic Party, with endorsements from Representative Jose E. Serrano and Borough President Fernando Ferrer, as well as the counsel of Roberto Ramirez, the Democratic leader in the Bronx.
Mr. Diaz is a Democratic district leader who, after failing to receive his party's endorsement, is running on the Independent and Liberal lines. He is endorsed by Herman Badillo, who was the nation's first Puerto Rican Congressman and is a close adviser to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. He is also supported by Ramon S. Velez, a Bronx political baron who oversees antipoverty programs.
But for both candidates, the weight of the fathers has been critically important, both in image and in resources. Mr. Diaz's father, who ran unsuccessfully for City Council, State Assembly and State Senate, runs three nonprofit centers for the elderly and heads an association of Hispanic ministers. An army of campaign workers brought in by the minister has been making telephone calls and filling the streets with placards.
Mr. Espada's father has built a political career on the strength of his social-services enterprises, which include seven health-care centers that employ more than 400 people in the Bronx. The younger Mr. Espada has retained Luis R. Sepulveda, a lawyer who ran his father's State Senate campaign in 1994. Mr. Espada's campaign is expected to use Senator Espada's network of political volunteers.
Both candidates say they are running to give an emerging group of young citizens a voice in the 75th District, a largely Puerto Rican area marred by high unemployment. The two candidates say they want to dispel the myths about political apathy among Hispanic youth.
"This race represents a new generation of leadership," Mr. Espada said. "I want to emphasize how important the voice of youth is."
Similarly, Mr. Diaz said, "I want to make changes that will have an impact on the problems of the district, especially for the youth."
Both describe an adolescence filled with the minutiae of their fathers' campaigns and say running for office was a consequence of doing every imaginable job for them.
"Many people look at my youth," Mr. Espada said. "But I feel I've been preparing for this all of my life."
Each young candidate went to work after high school.
Mr. Espada formed a marketing company that handles advertising and promotional events for small businesses. He is also pursuing a degree in business from Fordham University.
Mr. Diaz worked at odd jobs and later as a staff member for the City Council. He became active in the Democratic Party in the Bronx as a district leader and campaigned for the 1994 statewide ticket led by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. He administers examinations for the staff of the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission and is studying liberal arts at La Guardia Community College.
The two do not seem to disagree much on issues. Both oppose the death penalty, for instance, and support making changes in the structure of the school system.
But the short campaign has already produced some sparks. Mr. Diaz said yesterday that he plans a court challenge on Monday to remove Mr. Espada from the ballot, charging that he has not lived in the district for the one year required by state law. Mr. Espada denied the charge.
Mr. Ramirez, the Democratic county leader, said the decision on an endorsement in the race was "perhaps the hardest I have had to make." But he added that he decided on Mr. Espada because "he offers the best chance of winning."
Some politicians, however, suggested that Mr. Ramirez was acting to distance the Bronx Democratic Party from the controversy around Mr. Diaz's father. The older Mr. Diaz, who has run in the past on the Conservative and Right to Life tickets, has been a target of gay rights groups in recent years. They have accused him of being homophobic and ill suited for his position as a member of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, which reviews allegations of police brutality citywide.
"Espada, the father, is a sitting State Senator, and Ruben Diaz Sr. doesn't get along with Freddy Ferrer or Roberto Ramirez," said Israel Ruiz Jr., a Democratic City Councilman from the Bronx. "So for the Democrats, the question was: why deal with Ruben Diaz Sr. if you don't have to, even though the son is a decent young guy?"
Another consideration, Democratic officials contend, was mayoral politics. Many politicians reason that Mr. Ramirez's efforts to unify the long-fractured Bronx Democrats -- and elect Mr. Ferrer as Mayor next year -- would more likely benefit by solidifying his relationship with the Espadas. Senator Espada joined Representative Serrano two years ago in forming a splinter group of Democrats annoyed about not having influence in the party. But he recently mended fences with Mr. Ramirez and Mr. Ferrer, returning to active participation in the party and raising nearly $20,000 for Mr. Ferrer.
Mr. Espada and Mr. Diaz contend that their political views are strongly independent from their fathers. While Mr. Diaz strongly opposes the death penalty, his father supports it. His father opposes abortion, but he considers it a matter for women to decide individually.
"I love my father, but we disagree on some things," he said.
Similarly, Mr. Espada said: "Anyone who knows me knows that my father and I have very different points of view. I'm proud to be my father's son, but like any son, I have to stand on my own two feet."

HEADLINE: Auto Sales for January Increased by 4.7%

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 1

 BODY:
New vehicle sales over all rose 4.7 percent for most auto makers in January compared with the comparable 1995 period as buyers snapped up brawny pickups, sport utility vehicles and mini-vans but passed over passenger cars, according to sales data released today by nearly a dozen auto companies.
"January was a pretty strong month," said Joseph S. Phillippi, an auto analyst with Lehman Brothers. The total number of vehicles sold was 656,980, up from 627,694 in January 1995. 
 The vehicle sales strength suggested that the economy might not be teetering as close to the edge of recession as some economists had feared in recent weeks based on other economic statistics, such as weak retail sales in December. The Federal Reserve cited moderation in the pace of economic growth in its decision to lower short-term interest rates on Tuesday by a quarter of a percentage point.
General Motors sold 334,958 vehicles in January, barely up from 329,515 a year earlier; the daily sales rate was off 2.3 percent because dealerships were open 26 days last month and only 25 days in January 1995.
Sales of G.M.'s light trucks -- mini-vans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles -- rose 2.2 percent. But the company's car sales dropped 5.7 percent.
Chrysler sold 165,595 vehicles last month, up from 148,638 a year earlier, and the company's daily sales rate rose 7.1 percent. Chrysler's light trucks were popular, with sales up 21 percent. Car sales, however, dropped 13 percent.
The Ford Motor Company is scheduled to report its sales on Monday, but said it expected they would be below January 1995 levels. Joel H. Pitcoff, Ford's market analysis manager, said sales "will be down somewhat, because of the weather and because we had a very good month a year ago."
James W. Bush, an auto industry analyst at Ward's Automotive Reports, estimated that in January, Ford sold 264,000 vehicles -- 120,000 cars and 144,000 light trucks.
The sales results reported today also did not include Toyota, which will report them later. The data did include Honda and Nissan. Honda sales climbed 1.4 percent to, 48,967 vehicles, while Nissan sales jumped 19.1 percent, to 49,652 vehicles, including its Infinity models.
The industry as a whole is doing better than some had expected -- particularly because much of the East Coast's commerce was shut down in the January blizzard.
"I was surprised to see how well things came back toward the end of the month," said David M. Garrity, who follows the auto industry for Smith Barney Inc. "The real strength seems to be domestic truck sales," Mr. Garrity said, forecasting a 14.5 million seasonally adjusted annual rate for January sales.
Mr. Bush of Ward was more bullish, predicting that when all auto makers' January sales figures are in, they will show that last month the industry sold vehicles at an annual rate of between 14.8 and 14.9 million. "We're kind of back on trend," he said.
Mr. Phillippi of Lehman Brothers attributed the gains in part to the rising stock market, which made customers feel they could afford new cars. Also, falling interest rates on adjustable-rate mortgages and other loans made cars seem more affordable, he said, and that trend should be helped by the Federal Reserve's most recent interest rate cut. Interest rates should drop almost immediately for auto loans, lowering buyers' monthly car payments.
Indeed, auto makers are counting on the Fed to spur sales by lowering rates further. Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chief executive, said last week that unless the Federal Reserve cut the main rate for overnight bank borrowing to 5 percent by mid-April, the auto industry's forecast of selling 15 million vehicles this year might not come true. After Wednesday's cut, that rate stood at 5.25 percent.
Analysts said today that they were most impressed with Chrysler, the smallest of the Big Three.
"The market certainly is going to go to the low-cost producer," Mr. Garrity said. "Right now that seems to be Chrysler."

HEADLINE: Hart of the Arts

 BODY:
Kitty Carlisle Hart, who recently resigned as head of the New York State Council on the Arts, which distributes grants to cultural groups throughout the state, fit her job as precisely as a shell fits an egg. In the 20 years since her appointment by Gov. Hugh Carey, there was hardly a cultural institution in the state that she did not visit or a legislator she did not buttonhole. If the Arts Council's grants have usually been sagacious and wide-ranging, much of the credit is due to her determination to expose its members to everything that was going on in the state's cultural community. Her high profile helped compensate for the Council's low budget -- now $28.9 million after a series of drastic budget cuts during the Cuomo years. Gov. George Pataki will find her hard to replace.
To listen to New York's cultural community is to believe that the best successor to Kitty Carlisle Hart would be her clone. "The person who succeeds her," says Schuyler Chapin, New York's Commissioner of Cultural Affairs, "has to have her skill at dealing with the State Legislature. Also that person must really know the field, and be able to act as a full-time chairman. It could be someone who, like Kitty, was an actor. Or an artist. Or who came out of academe or the foundations. You want somebody deeply committed to the arts and preferably with a high profile -- somebody like Jane Alexander at the National Endowment for the Arts." 
 Agnes Gund, president of the Museum of Modern Art, also spoke of the Council's statewide scope and the Hart-like energy needed to head it: "This is one of the nation's leading arts organizations, and it really needs someone who can do the job."
"The reason you hear such positive things about Kitty Carlisle Hart," said Lynne Meadow, artistic director of the Manhattan Theatre Club, "is because she is a lover of all the arts."
"What you want in the Arts Council role," said Andre Bishop, artistic director of the Lincoln Center Theater, "is a publicly recognized personality who is afraid neither of politics nor politicians and can really talk up the importance of the arts."
The qualifications described by these arts professionals make sense, and Governor Pataki should pay attention to them. There is widespread private concern among cultural leaders in New York City about reports that Mr. Pataki wants to appoint a prominent contributor, Earle I. Mack, to this important post. Mr. Mack, a real estate developer and former chairman of the New York State Racing Commission, is on the board of both the Dance Theater of Harlem and the New York City Ballet. He has been involved as a producer and director in two well-regarded films about ballet -- "The Children of Theater Street," about Leningrad's Kirov Ballet School, and "She Dances Alone," a portrait of Nijinsky's daughter Kyra.
But when the Governor has all of New York State to choose from, these credentials are simply not weighty enough to make Mr. Mack the first choice for this job. The ideal candidate should have a strong record in the performing arts or an extended history of service in the major cultural institutions. He or she should also have a grasp of the funding needs of the arts community in New York City and of cultural institutions in the state. Finally, everyone who knows Mrs. Hart believes that her successor should have some of her talent for charming (and educating) the State Legislature about the importance of arts funding to both the civic and economic health of New York.
With Mrs. Hart probably not leaving her post before March, there is plenty of time for Mr. Pataki to conduct a broader search. It is also vital that the cultural community start lobbying the Governor to let him know that there is a demand for a candidate who seems a stronger bet to fill the void left by Mrs. Hart's retirement.

HEADLINE: Stocks Continue Climbing, With Dow Topping 5,400

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Stock prices rose yet again yesterday, crossing another milestone in response to the Federal Reserve's cut in short-term interest rates on Wednesday.
Just three days after finishing at more than 5,300 points for the first time, the Dow Jones industrial average breached 5,400, with its fifth consecutive increase. The Dow was down almost 25 points at one time during the session, but recovered to close at 5,405.06, up 9.76 points. 
 Among the broader indicators, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also edged higher to a record, rising 2.44 points, to 638.46. And the Nasdaq composite index increased 9.67 points, to 1,069.46.
Advances outnumbered declines on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,382 to 979. Turnover on the Big Board continued to be heavy, with 461.6 million shares traded.
"The stock market is comfortable with slow growth and low inflation," said Robert Froehlich, of Van Kampen/American Capital.
Bond prices were down sharply, in part because of an expected surge in new debt securities next week. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond plunged 23/32 and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.07 percent from 6.02 percent.
Semiconductor stocks led the upturn, after a Bear, Stearns report that greater demand for local area networking propelled sales of companies like LSI Logic. LSI advanced 3 7/8, to 32 1/8; Intel added 11/64 , to 56 1/4; Motorola rose 2, to 56, and Applied Materials increased 2 7/8, to 39 7/8.
Computer issues marched to the same drummer. I.B.M. rose 1/2, to 109; Hewlett-Packard closed at 87, up 2 1/4, and Compaq rose 1/4 to 47 3/8.
With gold jumping $5.20 an ounce, to $413.70, its highest level since August 1990, gold stocks rose for the second consecutive day. Newmont Mining jumped 2 1/8, to 58 1/8; Homestake Mining gained 5/8, to 19 5/8, and Barrick Gold rose 1 1/2, to 30 7/8.
In the oil sector, both Chevron and Texaco climbed after reaching a final agreement to sell their interests in a Japanese venture for $1.87 billion. Chevron was up 1 1/4, to 53 1/8, and Texaco was up 1 7/8 to 82 3/4.

HEADLINE: COMMUNICATIONS RESHAPED: A 'DIGITAL FREE-FOR-ALL';
A Measure's Long Reach

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Even the politicians who wrote the communications law stumble as they try to explain just what it will actually do, reverting to cliches about the "information superhighway" and the 21st century.
But the most concrete measure of its impact is to look at what the bill has already done, long before it was passed by Congress: 
 *It has prompted the AT&T Corporation to voluntarily split into three separate companies, plan to cut 40,000 jobs and write off billions of dollars in failed business -- all in anticipation of competing against the regional Bell companies in both local and long-distance telephone service.
*Persuaded two of the nation's four commercial television networks to merge with other media companies, with CBS being acquired by the Westinghouse Corporation, and Capital Cities/ABC about to complete its sale to the Walt Disney Company.
*Incited anxious merger talks between two of the seven giant Bell companies -- Nynex and Bell Atlantic -- to create a single company that would control local telephone and cellular systems from Virginia to Maine.
*Fostered a bewildering range of new media alliances and joint ventures -- among long-distance carriers, cable television companies, software companies like Microsoft and satellite television operators.
In theory, at least, consumers will benefit from the variety of new choices that communications competition is supposed to bring. In reality, no one, not even the shrewdest and most powerful media moguls, knows exactly what to expect next. But all of these moves were, in large part, pre-emptive strikes in anticipation of free-market warfare that will result from the communications bill.
At its simplest, the bill's core purpose is to unleash a "digital free-for-all," in the words of Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who has been one of the lawmakers pushing for a communications overhaul since the late 1980's. It would knock down decades of regulatory barriers that have prevented local telephone companies, long-distance carriers and cable television companies from attacking each other's markets -- and even allow electric utilities to seek ways to use their networks of wires and right-of-ways to carry communications traffic.
The bill will not, as many Republicans have maintained, simply "de-regulate" the communications industry. So complex is this legislation that it will actually spawn a mountain of new regulations and lucrative fees for lawyers.
Nor is it clear, despite the repeated promises of lawmakers today, that the bill will generate tens of thousands of new jobs. It may well have that effect eventually, but its most immediate impact has been to prompt telephone companies -- both the Bells and AT&T -- to slash their well-paid work forces.
And for all the forecasts of bare-knuckles competition, it also seems clear that the bill has ushered in a new era of industry consolidation, with huge media mergers and "full-service" conglomerates unlike any that have come before.
Will ordinary people be the only ones not to benefit?
Not necessarily. Recent history has shown that most predictions about the course of communications and media turn out to be wrong. The giant Bell companies have stumbled repeatedly in attempts to offer interactive video services over telephone networks, and have now retreated to cautious attempts at mimicking plain-vanilla cable television programming, transmitted over wireless networks.
Similarly, conventional wisdom on Wall Street is that the Bells will now snatch billions of dollars in business away from long-distance carriers. But some analysts argue that any revenue gains the Bells find in long distance may be more than offset by the money that their new rivals will siphon off in the local market.
"The Bells will be facing competition from all sides, and I'm just not convinced they are up to it," said Michael J. Mahoney, portfolio manager for the GT Global Telecommunications Fund, a mutual fund in San Francisco. "I wouldn't buy stock in those companies."
One who takes the long-term view is Vice President Al Gore, who when he was a Senate Democrat from Tennessee was one of the leading Congressional champions of tough cable television price regulations. He now argues that the long-term public benefits of untangling the regulatory thicket will vastly outweigh the disruption caused by new competition.
"If you look at new jobs, in the industries that make up this sector of the economy, the cumulative additions far outnumber the layoffs," he said tonight. "The large layoffs represent a tragedy for those involved, but there is no question that in this sector as a whole many more new jobs are being added than lost."
Although the bill has been a favorite item of business's agenda, it has drawn the support of many liberals as well, including Representative Markey, who said the coming turbulence is worth the price.
"Some companies will be winners and some companies will be losers, but there will be many more winners than losers," he said on the House floor today. "The country will be the big winner."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE LEAD;
Dole Backers See Fight in New Hampshire

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: NASHUA, N.H., Feb. 1

 BODY:
Leading supporters of Senator Bob Dole portrayed his campaign today as faltering and said they feared that he could no longer count on New Hampshire as an inevitable stepping stone toward the Republican Presidential nomination.
In a series of interviews, many of Mr. Dole's most outspoken advocates -- and even some of his top aides -- said his commanding lead over Steve Forbes had dramatically slipped in the last several days, particularly in this state, which in less than three weeks holds the nation's first Presidential primary. 
 While it is common for candidates to try to lower expectations about the outcome of an election, Mr. Dole himself, as well as his own campaign staff, officially remained bullish about his prospects here and discounted the accounts of his problems.
But other Dole associates, speaking both publicly and privately, said that while they had expected the race to tighten, they were not prepared for Mr. Forbes, the publishing magnate, to emerge so quickly as such a formidable competitor.
"This campaign is thoroughly volatile right now -- it's cracking wide open," said Ruth Griffin of Portsmouth, a local office holder, veteran Republican worker and strong backer of Mr. Dole. "I'm telling you there are a lot of people who are out there changing their minds."
John Stabile, the state Republican chairman, who is remaining neutral, said, "There is a horse race here. It's a wake-up call for Dole. Let's see if he wakes up."
Former Senator Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, one of Mr. Dole's closest advisers, praised the Senator's toughness and said Mr. Dole would prevail. But Mr. Rudman, too, seemed stunned at how well Mr. Forbes was doing in the polls.
"It's like someone comes and spends a billion dollars on a new toothpaste that wipes out the competition, even though it tastes terrible," Mr. Rudman said.
Many Republicans, including Mr. Rudman, said they worried that Mr. Dole's troubles were not necessarily caused by Mr. Forbes but by the Senator's failure to energize voters. "It's hard for anyone who's been in public life as long as Bob Dole to inspire much passion, frankly," Mr. Rudman said.
Even Mr. Dole's deputy campaign manager, William B. Lacy, said Mr. Forbes was doing far better than the campaign had expected and was causing voters to move from the Senator to the undecided column. "It's a real change in terms of the dynamics of the campaign," Mr. Lacy said. "Our critical strategic task over the next few days is to remind people why they were for Bob Dole from the beginning."
Reacting to Mr. Forbes's strength, Gov. Stephen Merrill of New Hampshire said today that he would assume a far more active role in campaigning for Mr. Dole. His help is reminiscent of the way then-Gov. John H. Sununu resuscitated George Bush's candidacy here in 1988.
And the Dole campaign is making an all-out assault on Mr. Forbes's signature flat-tax proposal as harmful to the middle class. In a commercial the campaign began broadcasting today, Governor Merrill warns: "Steve Forbes's income tax plan increases the deficit and raises our taxes."
Mr. Dole, in an appearance here today, called the Forbes proposal "snake oil."
The latest evidence of Mr. Dole's troubles is a poll of 400 likely Republican primary voters published today in The Boston Globe, showing that Mr. Forbes had caught up and perhaps overtaken Mr. Dole in New Hampshire. Mr. Forbes had 31 percent; Mr. Dole, 22 percent. The other Republican candidates were in single digits. The poll, conducted Jan. 29 and 30 by KRC Communications Research for The Globe and WBZ-TV, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.
Campaigning at an automobile dealership here today, Mr. Dole dismissed the poll, saying: "If I worried about every poll, I'd probably have an Excedrin headache. They're coming so fast now that you get poll fever."
While he brushed aside that poll, Mr. Dole referred, though not by name, to another survey of likely primary voters. But that poll, by the American Research Group, hardly had good news for him: it showed Mr. Dole and Mr. Forbes so close statistically as to be near a dead heat. Mr. Dole had 25 percent and Mr. Forbes 19 percent, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.
It also showed that Mr. Dole's support had slipped two points a day for the last five days. As recently as Jan. 27, the American Research poll showed Mr. Dole at 33 percent and Mr. Forbes at 16 percent.
Despite the glum forecasts even among many Dole partisans, voters, particularly in New Hampshire, traditionally make up their minds just days before they go to cast their ballots. Mr. Dole can recall that in 1988, he surged ahead of Mr. Bush in polls in this state, only to lose the primary. In addition, the outcome of the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 12 could have a marked effect on how candidates place in the New Hampshire primary, on Feb. 20.
"It is not Panicsville in the Dole campaign." said Peter Spaulding of Concord, a veteran Republican worker and Dole supporter. Still, Mr. Dole's advisers said Mr. Forbes's strength had caused tensions in the campaign. Don Sipple, the media consultant for the failed Presidential campaign of Gov. Pete Wilson of California, has, for example, taken a larger role in helping Stuart Stevens, who produces the campaign's commercials, devise a message.
In addition, some Dole advisers said they now regretted that the Senator did not spell out his own plan for a flat tax to head off Mr. Forbes. In a speech before the Economic Club of Chicago last September, Mr. Dole had been expected to lay out such a plan but spoke instead in generalities about overhauling the tax code.
Nor does Mr. Dole's campaign have the feel of a smoothly run front-runner's campaign. There is no large entourage, or even a bus to transport reporters. Even "Dole for President" signs are a rare sight around this state.
Trying to put the best face on Mr. Dole's position, some of his supporters said they hoped the tightness of the race would force people to take a closer, more critical, look at the weaknesses of Mr. Forbes.
"If Steve Forbes is really doing well in the polls," Governor Merrill said, "that's a negative for Steve Forbes, because people are now going to take him seriously. They're going to start running the numbers on the flat tax."
Indeed, the Globe poll suggested that support for Mr. Forbes's flat-tax plan had eroded and that Mr. Forbes's appeal was now in his portrayal of himself as a Washington outsider
"The flat tax thing got everybody's attention," State Representative Harold W. Burns, a Dole supporter and Speaker of the New Hampshire House, said. "You could say Forbes is on a roll. But I say it won't last, because when it comes time to vote folks will go with what's tried and true: Dole."

HEADLINE: U.S. Auto Makers Fear Strength Of Dollar Gives Edge to Japan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 1

 BODY:
With rebates spreading and profits threatened, the nation's car makers are now complaining about the strength of the dollar.
When the dollar was falling and the Japanese yen was rising, Japan's auto makers were raising prices regularly and handing the Big Three auto makers the best import-fighter ever: a price advantage. But now Japanese auto makers are skipping some price increases thanks to a round of significant cost-cutting, and the price difference between Japanese and American cars and trucks is shrinking. 
 What is more, Japanese auto makers, who have learned to live with a high yen-weak dollar, are anticipating a potential profit windfall as the dollar strengthens. Now, analysts say the Japanese are on the verge of raising the industry's standard for competitiveness.
By reducing costs, analysts believe, most Japanese car makers can compete profitably at an exchange rate of 100 yen to the dollar and either expand their market shares or reap large profits at today's exchange rate of nearly 107 yen to the dollar, from about 80 yen last April.
"At 80 yen per dollar, those shipments from Japan were losing billions of dollars -- at 107, they are wildly profitable again," said Jay N. Woodworth, an auto industry analyst in Summit, N.J. "The U.S. Big Three do not realize that, and I think that they do not appreciate the dramatic cost cutting the Japanese have done."
Indeed, despite some the most aggressive cost-cutting in the industry's history, Detroit may find it still has significant work to do just to hang on to its share of the auto market.
The chief executives of the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation agreed here today to warn the Clinton Administration about the cost of its strong-dollar policies. The car companies will not ask the Administration to intervene to drive the dollar down, said Andrew H. Card Jr., the president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association. "I think that's premature," he said. "We're going to express our concern and ask them to be sensitive to the impact it has on our domestic manufacturers."
Mr. Card would not rule out the possibility of seeking intervention, particularly if the dollar reaches 110 yen. "I personally think it should be at 100," he said. "If you just look at the numbers, from 80 to 107, that's billions of dollars" in sales.
Wall Street analysts are only now assessing what the dollar's rise and the yen's fall might mean for the American automobile industry. The combination of a rising dollar and falling Japanese costs represents "sort of a double-edged sword that they're dealing with here, or potentially being whacked with," said Joseph S. Phillippi, an analyst at Lehman Brothers.
Detroit is "wholly vulnerable" to a higher dollar, said Maryann Keller, an analyst at Furman Selz. It forces "us to look again at the basic competitiveness and cost structure" of Detroit, she said.
The dollar's 34 percent rebound to 107 yen has not only allowed the Japanese companies to return to robust profitability but also makes it harder for Detroit to keep raising prices, hold its market share, and continue reporting strong earnings.
The Mazda Motor Corporation has already refrained from any price increases in November, December and January for the first time in at least five years. The Nissan Motor Company is also planning little or no price increases for now.
"If the dollar had not appreciated like it has, we probably would have seen a continuation of the 2 to 3 percent a year price increases," said Robert J. Thomas, the president and chief executive of the Nissan Motor Corporation USA.
Heavy price discounts by Japanese manufacturers, made possible in part by the stronger dollar, pushed up the Japanese share of the United States market by 1.6 percentage points in December from a year earlier. And Japanese car makers announced further sales gains today.
Until recently, Detroit auto executives have said little publicly about the dollar's rise. But Chrysler officials say that the company's chairman and chief executive, Robert Eaton, did tell senior managers at a meeting last September that Toyota's costs to make the Previa mini-van in Japan, when converted from yen into dollars, were $4,870 greater than Chrysler's costs for the Plymouth Grand Voyager mini-van at an exchange rate of 80 yen to the dollar. But Chrysler faces a $2,650 disadvantage if a dollar is worth 110 yen, Mr. Eaton warned.
Auto executives have been more vocal about their concerns this week. David McCammon, Ford's vice president for finance, said recently that foreign exchange losses hit $500 million last year, reflecting the diminished value in dollars of overseas profits earned in foreign currencies.
But Mr. McCammon said the bigger cost of a higher dollar lay in the greater difficulty it poses for American companies as Japanese vehicles become cheaper here. "Mostly we think of it as hurting us in a competitive sense," he said.
American auto makers have a tradition of complaining about an overvalued dollar and may find that their latest worries will be ignored in Washington. And the effects of a rising dollar may not be as noteworthy this time around. Nearly 40 percent of the cars and trucks sold by Japanese companies in the United States last year were made in North America, so much of the manufacturing costs are in dollars, not yen.
American auto executives took pains in interviews to say that they were not complaining about the outcome from currency market trading but that they were concerned that the dollar's current level was partly the result of American and Japanese Government rehetoric and market interventions.
"I don't know if it's so much to complain to the Administration as to make the Administration aware of the effects a stronger dollar has on the auto industry," said Martin B. Zimmerman, Ford's executive director for government relations and corporate economics.
Even if the Administration wanted to brake the dollar's rise, there is no guarantee that the usual combination of rhetoric from top officials and currency market intervention would have much effect. A senior Treasury official said tonight that while the Administration cared about the auto industry, it still believed that "a strong dollar is in our overall national interest."

HEADLINE: A Swerve To the Right In California

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Barely a month after the State Assembly's Republicans, already in the majority for a year, gained real control of the chamber by finally uniting to elect a Republican Speaker, party leaders have begun to push through an ambitious conservative agenda that could bring profound change to California.
Beginning action on what the Republicans call their "contract with California," the Assembly this week has approved a bill that would bar the state, which does not recognize same-sex marriages performed within its borders, from recognizing such marriages performed elsewhere. 
 It has also passed a measure that would allow police and sheriff's departments to issue concealed-weapons permits to almost anyone.
It has approved a two-year limit on welfare payments to able-bodied adults, and a bill allowing farmers the continued use of methyl bromide, a highly toxic insecticide.
It has voted to slash the corporate tax rate by about 20 percent, from 9.3 percent to 7.5.
And it has approved a bill that, for people 21 or over, would repeal the state's five-year-old law requiring all motorcyclists to wear helmets. Although the existing law has been credited by state health officials with reducing motorcycle fatalities by 45 percent, it is described by sponsors of its repeal as an intrusion on personal freedom.
Whether any of this legislation will ever make its way into law is not clear. The State Senate is still controlled by Democrats, many of whom fervently oppose the conservative agenda, and the Republicans there are not counting on much support from their colleagues on the other side of the aisle.
"We're now in the macho stage of kooky ideas, where all of the pent-up energy over the years is now pouring out," the Senate's most powerful Democrat, Bill Lockyer, the President pro tem, told reporters this week. Eventually, he said, the "extremists" will "settle down and try to get some constructive bipartisan proposals in progress rather than just their right-wing social and economic agenda."
But California is the largest of the 17 states where one or both legislative chambers have switched from Democratic to Republican control since 1994. And if the Republicans here should gain control of the Senate this fall -- a prospect at which they are believed to have a genuine chance -- and if, as the cliche goes, California leads the nation in trends, then the conservative Republican resurgence here could prove enormously influential, especially given expectations that state governments, rather than the Federal, will increasingly take the lead in setting social policy.
For their part, Republican leaders in the Assembly are almost giddy over their accomplishments so far. "It's been a joy," said one of them, Larry Bowler. "To finally matter is just exhilarating. We've got 25 years of destruction we're trying to correct as quickly as we can."
Mr. Bowler's remark was a not-so-subtle dig at former Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr., the Democrat who, with almost contemptuous magnanimity, regularly outmaneuvered his Republican colleagues for more than a decade. Indeed, during Mr. Brown's long reign in Sacramento, it would have been virtually unthinkable for most of the proposals that reached the floor this week to have advanced that far.
All this changed a month ago, however, when Mr. Brown, who has since taken office as Mayor of San Francisco, was forced by California's new term-limits law to leave the Assembly after 30 years as a member, the last 14 as its Speaker. In the Speaker's chair now is Curt Pringle, a 36-year-old former drapery salesman from Orange County, a citadel of Republican conservatism. He is the first Speaker in 25 years elected with majority support of Republicans.
The Republicans, who now hold 41 of the Assembly's 80 seats, won their majority in the November 1994 elections. But Mr. Brown deftly exploited division within their ranks to keep Democrats in power, first winning re-election himself as Speaker and then handing the job to a Republican ally, Doris Allen of Orange County. Ms. Allen quit the post, considered second in power only to that of the governor, before she was recalled in a special election in November. Mr. Brown then engineered the short-lived Speakership of another Republican, Brian Sentencich of Fresno.
While Mr. Brown's retirement has certainly energized Assembly Republicans, it is not the only locomotive driving the new legislative agenda. Perhaps of more profound impact, political analysts say, are the new term limits. The Legislature is now stocked with short-termers who, these analysts say, are much more inclined than their predecessors to bow to a public clamoring for tax relief and get-tough measures against crime.
"What's going on in the Assembly now is a miniature version of what went on in Congress after the '94 elections," said Bruce Cain, associate director of the Institute for Government Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. "In previous years, extreme bills have been stopped in the legislative process. But if the Republicans get complete control of the Assembly, the Senate and the governorship, then these bills could be a taste of the future."
So far, Gov. Pete Wilson has taken no official stand on most of the new measures. But the Governor has generally looked with favor on get-tough anti-crime initiatives, and, badly bruised in his failed campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination, he has made no secret of his desire to re-establish himself as a national leader. Heading a young and eager pack of right-leaning legislators could be just the vehicle he needs.
Things could also go the other way, of course: if the conservative legislative drive here is ultimately repelled by the Democrats, Republicans in other states may well prove wary of taking the same bold path.
In any event, although Speaker Pringle's ascendancy gives Republicans a better chance of enacting some of their most cherished goals, doing so will be no picnic. For one thing, even some of the bills already passed have riled powerful interests, from civil libertarians to teachers to business. And there are already signs that the Republicans are apt to compromise in the face of sustained criticism.
On Tuesday, for example, the Assembly rejected a bill that would have allowed judges to punish young graffiti vandals by sentencing them to as many as 10 whacks with a hardwood paddle, administered by a bailiff or their parents in open court. The proposal would have allowed the name of vandals to be made available for publication, in the hope that humiliation of either child or parent would be a deterrent. A companion bill would have repealed the state's decade-old ban on corporal punishment in public schools.
Opponents argued that paddling had little proven value in keeping adolescents out of mischief, especially those from poor, already troubled families.
While Democrats are doing all they can to derail the Republicans' social agenda, not a few are quietly pleased with it.
"I'm thrilled this is happening," said Darry Sragow, a Democratic strategist. "This confirms that the Republicans are no better at governing than the Democrats are," he said, adding that issues like school paddling and helmet-law repeal "are fundamentally immaterial."
"Most voters who could vote -- and many don't -- just shake their heads," Mr. Sragow said, "and wonder why they're paying out their hard-earned tax dollars for salaries of the people who are doing this stuff."
Tony Quinn, a veteran Sacramento lobbyist and former Republican legislative aide, also feels that the agenda being pursued by conservatives could backfire. He compares the Assembly's actions to the iconoclastic politics of Berkeley, where the City Council often tilts well to the left on world and national matters.
"The Berkeley City Council," Mr. Quinn said, "has a reputation for being a bunch of nut cakes. Instead of concerning themselves with what's happening on the streets of Berkeley, they're worried about what's going on in El Salvador."
Similarly, issues like punitive paddling and helmet-law repeal, Mr. Quinn said, "are not the issues of concern to the middle class," and by focusing on them, rather than on the economy or the environment, the Assembly Republicans are "making a considerable mistake."

The Words Not Spoken

BYLINE: By A.M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
The Secretary of State worked hard polishing the speech. He wanted it to be his best, to sum up his vision of America's place in the world, particularly Asia.
And it did turn out to be the one speech that will always be associated with his career. It is remembered because of two words he did not speak. 
 On Jan. 12, 1950, Secretary Dean Acheson said that the American defensive perimeter -- plainly the areas where America would draw the line -- "runs along the Aleutians to Japan and then goes to the Ryukyus." The two words he left out were "South Korea" -- an ally constantly threatened by North Korea, a dependency of Communist China.
Six months later the North Koreans attacked the South -- and might have anyway. But American and Asian historians have generally believed that the omission of those two words helped convince the North Koreans that the U.S. would not do much about an attack on the South.
The speech has served for decades as a textbook case of how war can start by sliding over the threat and not stating what the price might be to the aggressor.
Once again, it seems to me, the U.S. is in danger of doing that -- this time about Communist China's maniacal threats of a war against Taiwan, 80 miles across the Straits.
Daily for months now, Beijing has threatened military attack against Taiwan. It says the leaders of Taiwan are plotting to make it independent of China. Beijing knows that top leaders of Taiwan plan no such thing.
But Taiwan did recently carry out the first free national election in the history of the Chinese people, and plans another in March. While not demanding independence, the Taiwan leadership does ask the world to acknowledge it as the separate thriving reality it has become.
For its freedoms and modest international ambitions, Beijing cannot forgive Taiwan, not until it surrenders its mind and future.
Beijing threatens naval blockade, and says missiles will fall every day in Taiwan. Already action has been added to threat -- missile "tests" near Taiwan and menacing amphibious landings opposite Taiwan.
To the U.S., which would inevitably become involved in a Chinese-started war that neither America nor Taiwan wants or incites, China offers the usual contempt. Beijing passes word that the U.S. is more interested in Los Angeles than Taiwan -- nasty nuclear blackmail. No country planning war ever delivered clearer threats than China against Taiwan.
The U.S. does caution Beijing. It says an attack on Taiwan would violate U.S. understandings with China and America's treaty with Taiwan. But it is done privately, without specifics about what the U.S. might do.
Washington believes the Chinese may be bluffing, and in any case will not make a direct land assault. But Beijing can easily carry out other attacks. Beijing and the American people should know what the U.S. might do if Beijing blockaded Taiwan or sank its ships or carried out daily missile raids. Would we reply in military proportion? Would we cut off the trade with China that finances the Chinese Army?
And can Beijing take America's whispered, unspecific cautions seriously if at the same time the U.S. helps strengthen the vast industrial empire of the Chinese Army, not only through trade but something called "defense conversion"?
The Far Eastern Economic Review reports that Defense Secretary Perry's plans for the Chinese to convert their arms and nuclear industries to civilian use have had only one tangible result -- "a lucrative business deal for Perry's friends and a springboard for China's efforts to develop a modern military-communications system." Representative Floyd D. Spence, chairman of the House Committee on National Security, has asked Mr. Perry for a reply.
Like other countries looking for trouble, China puts less credibility in another country's whispered cautions than it does in open statements about the cost to be paid.
So, as long as the U.S. gives neither China nor the American people an idea of what Washington might do to meet military action against Taiwan, it increases the possibility of war.
Giving advance warnings of consequences is not warmongering. As the Secretary of State and America found out 46 years ago, it is wiser and safer to say the words than to pencil them out.

HEADLINE: The Republican Welfare Trap

 BODY:
House Republicans have a plan to corner President Clinton politically. They want to pass the Senate's welfare reform bill, which is less extreme than the House bill but still nasty. No matter what he does, someone will accuse the President of betraying his promises. If he signs the bill he will, by his staff's estimates, throw more than a million children into poverty and infuriate his party's liberal wing. If he vetoes it, the G.O.P. will accuse him of repudiating not only his campaign promise to reform the welfare system but also his grudging embrace of the Senate bill when it passed by an overwhelming majority in September. That mistake has returned to haunt him. 
 Mr. Clinton's choice -- alienating moderates who were won over by his campaign promises or enraging liberal advocates of the current system -- would be unenviable for any politician, let alone a Democrat running for re-election. His best course of action is the right course. That is to admit that his earlier embrace of the Senate plan, which Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York has justifiably described as "an obscene act of social regression," was wrong. He should then veto it or any other bill that rips holes in the nation's 60-year-old safety net.
The Senate bill would end the system under which Washington guarantees to match state contributions to poor mothers with children. That historic entitlement has not only encouraged states to provide adequate benefits. It has also cushioned economic downturns by pumping cash into needy hands.
In addition, the bill would allow states to opt out of the food stamp program -- the only Federal program that sets a uniform standard of relief for everyone in the country. The measure would cut off legal, taxpaying immigrants from food stamps and other help and fall $12 billion short of the money needed to achieve what the Republicans insist is their ultimate goal -- putting welfare recipients to work. The truth is that finding jobs for welfare mothers requires child care, training and transportation -- expenses that dwarf the cost of sending them a check. The Republicans simply duck the financial realities.
Lost in this catfight is the fact that the nation already has a pretty good welfare law, the Family Support Act of 1988. The major problem is that Congress never put nearly enough money behind the law's welfare-to-work provisions to make them function. Senate Democrats previously proposed doing just that. Mr. Clinton's welfare reform bill went even further -- imposing time limits on welfare, which the Republicans favor, but also providing money for child care, job training and, as a last resort, a public-sector job for parents who try without success to find private-sector work. Once the Republicans took control of Congress, these worthwhile bills were dead.
Mr. Clinton was forced to backtrack. But his rhetorical concessions in September, when the Senate voted 87 to 12 for the Republican bill, went much too far. He was petrified at the prospect of walking into November as a defender of the current welfare system. No Democratic President ought to accept a bill that would tear down the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt.
Fortunately, the mood on Capitol Hill has changed. Newt Gingrich is flying closer to the ground. Voters are dissatisfied with the hard edges of the Republican agenda. There is a fighting chance that Mr. Clinton can keep faith with the traditional liberal base of his party without alienating the middle-class voters who, in 1992, resonated to his promise to "end welfare as we know it." Mr. Clinton can take the risk of vetoing a measure he knows is harsh and punitive.

HEADLINE: Hart of the Arts

 BODY:
Kitty Carlisle Hart, who recently resigned as head of the New York State Council on the Arts, which distributes grants to cultural groups throughout the state, fit her job as precisely as a shell fits an egg. In the 20 years since her appointment by Gov. Hugh Carey, there was hardly a cultural institution in the state that she did not visit or a legislator she did not buttonhole. If the Arts Council's grants have usually been sagacious and wide-ranging, much of the credit is due to her determination to expose its members to everything that was going on in the state's cultural community. Her high profile helped compensate for the Council's low budget -- now $28.9 million after a series of drastic budget cuts during the Cuomo years. Gov. George Pataki will find her hard to replace.
To listen to New York's cultural community is to believe that the best successor to Kitty Carlisle Hart would be her clone. "The person who succeeds her," says Schuyler Chapin, New York's Commissioner of Cultural Affairs, "has to have her skill at dealing with the State Legislature. Also that person must really know the field, and be able to act as a full-time chairman. It could be someone who, like Kitty, was an actor. Or an artist. Or who came out of academe or the foundations. You want somebody deeply committed to the arts and preferably with a high profile -- somebody like Jane Alexander at the National Endowment for the Arts." 
 Agnes Gund, president of the Museum of Modern Art, also spoke of the Council's statewide scope and the Hart-like energy needed to head it: "This is one of the nation's leading arts organizations, and it really needs someone who can do the job."
"The reason you hear such positive things about Kitty Carlisle Hart," said Lynne Meadow, artistic director of the Manhattan Theatre Club, "is because she is a lover of all the arts."
"What you want in the Arts Council role," said Andre Bishop, artistic director of the Lincoln Center Theater, "is a publicly recognized personality who is afraid neither of politics nor politicians and can really talk up the importance of the arts."
The qualifications described by these arts professionals make sense, and Governor Pataki should pay attention to them. There is widespread private concern among cultural leaders in New York City about reports that Mr. Pataki wants to appoint a prominent contributor, Earle I. Mack, to this important post. Mr. Mack, a real estate developer and former chairman of the New York State Racing Commission, is on the board of both the Dance Theater of Harlem and the New York City Ballet. He has been involved as a producer and director in two well-regarded films about ballet -- "The Children of Theater Street," about Leningrad's Kirov Ballet School, and "She Dances Alone," a portrait of Nijinsky's daughter Kyra.
But when the Governor has all of New York State to choose from, these credentials are simply not weighty enough to make Mr. Mack the first choice for this job. The ideal candidate should have a strong record in the performing arts or an extended history of service in the major cultural institutions. He or she should also have a grasp of the funding needs of the arts community in New York City and of cultural institutions in the state. Finally, everyone who knows Mrs. Hart believes that her successor should have some of her talent for charming (and educating) the State Legislature about the importance of arts funding to both the civic and economic health of New York.
With Mrs. Hart probably not leaving her post before March, there is plenty of time for Mr. Pataki to conduct a broader search. It is also vital that the cultural community start lobbying the Governor to let him know that there is a demand for a candidate who seems a stronger bet to fill the void left by Mrs. Hart's retirement.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETSWeakness in Europe and Japan Fails to Bring a Rally for Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most major currencies yesterday on profit taking by currency traders disappointed that the dollar did not rally this week despite evidence of slowing European and Japanese economies.
The dollar fell against both the German mark and the Japanese yen after the dollar spent the day rising and falling against both currencies. 
 With the dollar upwardly mobile for the last few months, traders had expected that the weakening economies of Europe and the need to fix Japan's four-year downward tilt would bolster the dollar for some time.
But when the German central bank allowed one of its important interest rates to drop on Wednesday, the dollar did not jump. The Bundesbank also disappointed the markets Thursday when its policy-making committee did not cut official rates.
"It is profit taking and a certain amount of frustration," said Margaret Kudarauskas, senior foreign exchange analyst at the Boston office of Technical Data. That included "the frustration on Wednesday that the dollar did not rally, especially dollar-mark, after the Fed ease," she said.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar traded at 1.4823 marks, compared with 1.4875 on Thursday. It finished at 106.55 yen, compared with 106.75 the day before. The British pound rose to $1.5235 from $1.5186.
In a thin market like yesterday's, small trades can have an exaggerated effect on the market.
The dollar's weakness against the yen was also partly the result of heavy yen buying by hedge funds, which had sold marks after the German currency failed to continue its advance against the yen.
In addition, American stock and bond markets fell yesterday, taking away some of the dollar's support. Gold buyers also hedged their bets, with bullion in Hong Kong jumping $10 and prices in the United States rising "with a vengeance" to a six-year high, Ms. Kudarauskas of Technical Data said.
With German economic data showing weakness, Europe fearful it is entering a recession and the United States looking just that much better, "the market is still buying time" while waiting for more German rate cuts, said David Solin, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, an investment advisory firm.

HEADLINE: Martin Kessler, 66, Publisher of Noted Books, Dies

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Martin Kessler, a New York publisher of influential books about contemporary social history, public policy and economics, died on Thursday at his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was 66.
The cause was brain cancer, said his daughter, Elinor Kessler. 
 At his death, Mr. Kessler had his own imprint, Martin Kessler Books/ Free Books. He started his career at Free Press publishers in Manhattan but in 1967 joined Basic Books, where he acquired, edited and published many authors whose ideas and critiques could inspire public discussion for years and shape the viewpoints of readers.
He rejoined The Free Press in 1993 and started his imprint with "The Tyranny of the Majority" by Lani Guinier, who had been nominated by President Clinton to be Assistant Attorney General for civil rights.
It was a book that gave Ms. Guinier a chance to present her views on voting rights to he general public. Opponents of Ms. Guinier had used some of her earlier writings on the subject to derail her nomination.
Mr. Kessler's current books include "The Winner-Take-All Society" by Robert H. Frank and Phillip J. Cook, "The Luck Business" by Robert Goodman and "On the Eve of the Millenium" by Conor Cruise O'Brien.
In his 25 years at Basic Books he edited and published two Pulitzer-Prize winning books, "Godel, Escher, Bach" by Douglas Hofstadter and "The Social Transformation of American Medicine" by Paul Starr.
He shepherded to publication notable books like "Losing Ground" by Charles Murray, "The Zero Sum Society" by Lester Thurow, "The De industrialization of America" by Barry Bluestone and Ben Harrison and "The Evolution of Cooperation" by Robert Axelrod.
Other titles under his care included "Faces at the Bottom of the Well" by Derrick Bell, "Reflections of an Affirmative Action Baby" by Stephen L. Carter, "The Overworked American" by Juliet Schor, "Trading Places" by Clyde V. Prestowitz, and "Poor Support" by David W. Ellwood.
Among the authors he edited were James Q. Wilson, Michael Walzer, Joseph Nye, Sylvia Hewlett, Herbert Simon and Robert Alter. During 14 of his 25 years at Basic Books he served as president and editorial director.
Mr. Kessler was born in Vienna. He immigrated to England in 1939, where he completed high school. After coming to New York in 1946, he graduated from City College with a degree in history and earned an M.A. in political science at New York University.
Beside his daughter, also of the Upper West Side, he is survived by his former wife, Aline Pick Kessler, who lives in Greenwich Village.

HEADLINE: Economic Data Cause Selloff in Long Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were mixed yesterday, with the shorter maturities showing some strength, but with the longer maturities being hammered, as traders reacted uncertainly to the day's employment report.
Traders said the short end of the market was supported by buyers anticipating more cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve on the heels of the overall weak economic reports. 
 The long end of the market would normally stage a rally on weak numbers like yesterday's nonfarm payroll data, which showed a loss of 201,000 jobs last month. Such signs of a slowing economy are taken as indicators that inflation will be weak. The long bonds did not, however, follow the usual script yesterday as the Clinton Administration said that the job market might actually have improved last month but that the numbers failed to show that because the data were skewed by the Northeast blizzard and the partial shutdown of the Government.
Given the vagaries of the weather, the long end of the government securities market seemed to place more emphasis on other factors, like higher commodity prices, that might suggest a rise in inflation and on the looming supply of new debt issues coming to market in the next week.
The 30-year bond dropped 110/32 , to 10922/32 for a yield of 6.16 percent, up from 6.07 percent on Thursday. The two-year note held steady at 4.90 percent.
The Treasury will be selling about $84.9 billion in new debt securities next week, with $44.5 billion of that representing the Government's quarterly refunding, much of it in long maturities.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said, "For some market participants, the weak employment report today may have been skewed by a number of factors including the blizzard on the East Coast, the strike in New York and the temporary Government shutdown." He was referring to the strike by building maintenance workers in New York City.
He also noted as reasons for some of the market's fears, the high daily reading of commodity prices, the stronger-than-expected numbers in a Columbia University inflation index and the surge in hourly earnings.
"Although many market participants reasoned that the loss of many jobs at the low end of the wage structure during the month may have overly boosted the average hourly earnings numbers," Mr. Chan said, "others were not as quick to discount the previous month's strength, which could not be blamed on the same factor."
"In a market which has thrived on the expectation of future Fed easings, most market players quickly realized that if inflation were to accelerate, then bonds would decline," he said.
Hamilton Davis, a vice president of government trading at Everen Securities Inc. in Chicago, attributed a good part of the higher bond yields to the coming refunding, particularly given the large amount of longer maturities involved. He also said that all the weakness in the January payroll data could not be explained away by weather conditions.
"So you have a technical condition where buyers are more comfortable buying shorter maturities believing that the Fed is on their side," Mr. Davis said. "Consequently dealers of Treasury securities view the refunding as an opportunity to make money on a setup trade."
Mr. Davis described the weakness in bonds as dealers' positioning themselves to buy the longer maturities next week at yields that would give them the potential for price improvement after the auctions were over.
In when-issued trading, the three-year note to be auctioned on Tuesday was offered at a price to yield 5.02 percent. The 10-year note to be sold on Wednesday was at 5.65 percent and the 30-year bond, set for a Thursday auction, was at 6.09 percent.

HEADLINE: Arnold E. Safer, 59, Analyst and Expert On Energy Markets

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Arnold E. Safer, an economist who was an expert in the world energy markets, died on Jan. 13 in his home in Rockville, Md. He was 59.
The cause was a heart attack. 
 Mr. Safer founded a consulting firm, the Energy Futures Group, which in collaboration with Benjamin Schlesinger & Associates of Bethesda, Md., helped many clients to understand how the gradual deregulation of the natural gas industry in the 1980's would lead to much freer trading of gas and how the emerging spot and futures markets for gas would work.
Benjamin Schlesinger said Mr. Safer had also played a crucial role as adviser to the New York Mercantile Exchange in setting up the trading of futures in heating oil in the late 1970's. Mr. Schlesinger recalled that Mr. Safer predicted as far back as the 1960's that market forces would prevail over rigid cartel pricing in world oil markets. And in the 1970's, he concluded that growing production outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would weaken the cartel's ability to set prices, which eventually proved to be true.
Mr. Safer was born in Boston, graduated from Brandeis University and received a doctorate in economics from the University of Rochester. He taught at Rice University and was at one time the chief economist with the Irving Trust Company in New York.
He founded his consulting firm in 1981 and helped put together an analysis of how the natural gas industry would change after its planned deregulation in 1985. His clients included the World Bank, the Energy Department and numerous corporations.
He is survived by his wife Roberta and three daughters, Karen of Silver Spring, Md., and Jocelyn and Adina, both of San Francisco.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Where Small Is Beautiful;
For Italy's Family-Owned Weavers, Life Is Good

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: BIELLA, Italy

 BODY:
Because the weavers on the other side of the valley specialize in cashmere, and the nearby Loro Piana company has a two-year monopoly on the supply of vicuna wool, Paolo Ferla is betting his company's future on the highly prized fleece of the baby alpaca.
Mr. Ferla's company, Lanificio Egidio Ferla S.p.A., is just one of 1,800 family-owned textile producers nestled in the hills around this northern Italian town. Together, they employ 28,000 people -- an average of just 16 each. In the era of the global marketplace, where even giant corporations must fight to protect their turf against low-cost third world competitors, such small-scale operators might seem quaint anachronisms, doomed to extinction. 
 They are anything but. Not only has Biella beaten back the onslaught of cheap textiles from the Far East, it has also inundated Japan, Korea and China with its own top-of-the-line fabrics. When Europe emerged from recession last year, Biella was at the forefront of the Continent's export push, helping Italy rack up a $15.8 billion trade surplus in textiles ($20.5 billion when leather goods and other apparel are included). Demand for Biella's cloths is so strong that the regional unemployment rate has sunk to 5 percent, less than half Western Europe's overall jobless rate of 12 percent, and local business owners complain of a shortage of skilled labor.
Few Americans may realize it, but in Europe, as in the United States, small businesses are assuming an increasingly crucial role as engines of economic growth. While the problems of huge industrial conglomerates like Germany's Daimler-Benz A. G. or Italy's Olivetti S.p.A. grab the headlines, thousands of family enterprises are quietly innovating, increasing sales and exports, and creating jobs.
Pockets of small-business dynamism are scattered across the Continent, from machine-building companies around Bologna, Italy, or in the Germany state of Baden-Wurttemberg, to the shoe makers and tile producers of the Catalonia region of Spain, to the perfume manufacturers of Grasse, France. Collectively they are a bright spot in a Europe otherwise mired in slow growth, high unemployment and out-of-control budget deficits that threaten outbursts of social unrest like the strikes that recently swept France.
The family-owned textile companies of Biella sometimes seem almost relentless in their smallness, with even companies of a dozen workers or fewer setting up employees as suppliers. Yet they show remarkable agility at solving problems, in part because their size makes them more nimble, but also because of an unusual willingness to share technology, marketing and manufacturing experience, and sometimes even production capacity with their home-town competitors.
And rather than having to fight off Government antitrust regulators, they actually get encouragement from the 15-nation European Union, so long as their collaboration at home does not translate into monopolistic practices abroad.
"The advantage is that at any time you can easily talk to your bank, your competitors, your suppliers," said Mr. Ferla, 38, whose $12- million-a-year company employs 65 people who produce 400,000 yards of fabric a year. "Biella is perfect for business."
Biella's textile-weaving community is the product of centuries of growth. Riccardo Piacenza still lives in the house his forebears used in 1733 to start a textile business. Over a lunch of boiled beef and vegetables, he described how the industry grew rapidly in the 19th century after textile machines were imported from Belgium and Britain. In time, Biella boasted all layers of textile work, from spinning to weaving to finishing. To supply the textile makers, local textile machine companies sprang up.
The town's peculiar mix of cooperation and competition dates back at least to those days, when textile mills routinely let competitors inspect their latest equipment.
In the 1960's, the local industrialists banded together to finance a training school for textile workers. In the 1970's, they started a joint trade fair to promote Biella's textiles. And in the 1980's, local textile-machinery manufacturers formed a consortium to sell their products in China's newly liberalized market.
Today, the textile companies have gotten so chummy that some economists liken them to the divisions of a large corporation. When floods of orders exceed one manufacturer's capacity, competitors are often called in to help assure deliveries -- and keep customers happy.
At Ing. Loro Piana & C. S.p.A., Sergio Loro Piana leads a visitor through a new $31 million plant, where computer-controlled machines spin cashmere yarns at dizzying speeds. The equipment is so advanced that only a handful of workers are needed to operate it. Yet far from hiding it from other local textile barons, Mr. Piana, who with his brother Pier Luigi runs the $162 million-a-year company that a forebear founded in 1924, said he would invite them all to inspect the new machinery when the plant is formally inaugurated later this year.
Gestures like that make Biella's companies fiercely loyal to one another. Mr. Ferla said his company paid local suppliers up to 10 percent more than the same goods might cost elsewhere just to maintain a longstanding relationship. "We seldom try to struggle with subcontractors," he said. "We don't want to kill anyone. We learned this from our grandfathers. It's very wise in the long run."
Mr. Ferla's company found itself on the receiving end of its neighbors' largess when it made its move into baby alpaca, a rare and extremely delicate wool. Spinning and finishing the fibers was supposed to be all but technically impossible.
But, working with nearby spinning-machine companies and finishing specialists, Mr. Ferla's company found a way. Now, it supplies the lightweight fabric, half the price of cashmere, to American apparel makers like Hickey Freeman and Oxxford Clothing.
The collaboration in Biella has not touched off any inquiries from Italian or European Union antitrust authorities, perhaps because the weavers seem to have a keen sense of where cooperation ends and competition begins. Rival factory owners will sit over a lunch of polenta and chicken at the local tennis-club restaurant discussing the difficulties of spinning some tricky new fiber or procuring wool supplies. But when they go abroad hawking their wares to apparel manufacturers in Japan or the United States, it is usually other Biella manufacturers they are competing against.
The European Union generally encourages cooperative efforts by regional clusters of small businesses, and the idea has stirred international interest. In the United States, banding together to survive outside competitive threats has become more common for localized industries, but there the small-business partnerships tend to get more of a helping hand from state governments. Richard M. Locke, a specialist on industrial districts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, cited programs in both Massachusetts and Pennsylvania to help their garment and machine-tool industries in the 1980's.
European small businesses are beginning to show signs of wanting the same sort of government attention. Biella's industrialists recently joined 13 other Italian districts to form a lobbying organization that seeks links with similar industrial regions elsewhere in Europe. The goal, according to Enrico Botto Poala, a textile maker who is its first president, is to pressure the European Union to shift industrial policy from a focus on helping backward regions to doing more for regional small-business groups.
One reason for Biella's backscratching is an awareness of its vulnerability. Memories of the 1970's, when a sputtering economy and a flood of cheap Asian imports wiped out half of the region's textile companies, remain vivid.
To respond to that crisis, the Biellese brought out innovative new products, including Loro Piana's light Tasmanian wools. To increase efficiency, many companies spun off some of their operations or helped finance start-ups that specialized in various steps of the textile process like spinning, dyeing or finishing. Biella's weavers also invested heavily in research and technology.
To be sure, many locals fear that the region, which is one-fourth the size of Rhode Island and has a population of 190,000, remains overdependent on a single industry. While it has developed other manufacturing, like valves and bathroom fixtures, it still relies on textiles for one-third of employment. Meantime, the growth of Italian textile exports is slowing, and raw-material prices are rising.
But Biella textile makers are responding to the challenges. Many, for example, have shifted some of their production abroad. Piacenza now spins cashmere yarns in China, the world's principal supplier of cashmere wool. Loro Piana does likewise, and last year formed a joint venture in Outer Mongolia, another cashmere region, and signed an agreement to obtain vicuna after helping Peru rescue the endangered species. Earlier, Loro Piana acquired Warren of Stafford, a textile mill in Stafford Springs, Conn.
Arnaldo Bagnasco, an economist at Turin University, said he believed Biella's textile industry would undoubtedly get more efficient if it could win tax concessions from the Italian Government and economic assistance -- including money for better roads and telecommunications -- from the European Union authorities in Brussels.
Moreover, the textile-mill owners remain confident that the same skills that enabled them to surmount previous crises will steer them through any new troubles. Riccardo Piacenza, a representative of the 13th generation running his family's business, likens Biella's products to Swiss watches that cannot be easily duplicated by would-be competitors.
Mr. Loro Piana is equally upbeat. "There are some very good manufacturers all over the world," he said. "But we don't see, systematically, any other region, any bunch of companies, capable of casting a serious shadow on our district."

HEADLINE: Peddler Testifies In Firebomb Trial

 BODY:
A peddler testified yesterday that about half an hour after a firebomb exploded in a subway train in Manhattan, he saw a badly-burned man drop a pair of singed, gasoline-soaked gloves in the Clark Street subway station in Brooklyn.
The peddler, Ine Kyu Choi, testifying in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, identified the man as Edward J. Leary, a 50-year-old unemployed computer technician from New Jersey who is accused of attempted murder and assault in the 1994 explosion. 
 Mr. Choi, a Korean immigrant who sold hats and other items at the Clark Street station, said Mr. Leary dropped the gloves while making a phone call. A police officer had called for an ambulance and he and a dozen officers did not think to pick up the gloves, Mr. Choi said.
It was an hour later, when Mr. Leary had become a suspect, that two detectives arrived looking for the gloves, Mr. Choi said. He directed them to a trash container where Mr. Leary had thrown them, he said.
The prosecution contended that dropping the gloves was part of a rational plan by Mr. Leary to evade detection but the defense has claimed that Mr. Leary was insane at the time of the explosion and afterward, and did not know what he was doing as a result of taking a mixture of drugs prescribed for depression.

HEADLINE: Olestra? Quelle Horreur!

BYLINE: By Judith Warner; Judith Warner is a biographer and magazine writer.

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
The announcement that the Food and Drug Administration had approved olestra, a fat substitute, provoked great fanfare in the United States. And the manufacturer, Procter & Gamble, is seeking approval in Britain and Canada, too.
But in France there is no such rush for approval. Here, the idea that Americans had found a product that allows them to eat junk without ingesting fat seemed like proof, once again, that when it comes to gastronomy, they have their heads screwed on wrong. 
 French nutrition experts point to the facts: Every year, hundreds of low-fat or nonfat products are introduced into American supermarkets -- more than 1,300 new creations appeared in 1995 alone. Yet, at the same time, the number of overweight people has increased from one in four Americans in 1980 to one in three in 1994.
"It's quite a paradox," says Dr. France Bellisle, an obesity specialist at the Hotel Dieu hospital in Paris. "It's good to cut fats, but fats are obviously just one part of a much larger picture." For Dr. Bellisle and other French doctors, the other part of the picture is quite simple: Americans eat too much.
"It's not just the doughnuts, the hamburgers, the sugary drinks, but the eating between meals," says Serge Renaud, a nutritionist at a scientific research center in Bordeaux. "If people want to lose weight, they should eat three meals a day -- two light and one heavier at dinnertime, which will allow them to appreciate the beauty of their food."
Enjoy the beauty of food? The concept is an ocean away from the world of olestra. The fat substitute has been reported to cause side effects like nausea, diarrhea and intestinal cramping -- not to mention the loss of nutrients. All this for something that tastes terrible, according to Dr. Bellisle, who has sampled food made with olestra.
"For the French, food is primarily about taste, quality and socializing," says Claude Fischler, a researcher at the Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris, who has studied French and American eating habits.
In fact, the French had their own flirtation with "lite" foods. From 1984 to 1988, sales of light butters tripled. From 1988 to 1989, the consumption of low-fat spreads went up 43 percent. But the tide turned just as quickly. From 1991 to 1994, consumption of light dairy products alone fell about 35 percent.
Economics was one reason these products failed. When the economy went bad in the early 1990's, people were unwilling to pay more for products that offered less. The medical establishment weighed in, too: Two prominent nutritionists spoke out against all things "lite." Given that the French have the second lowest rate of coronary heart disease in the developed world (after Japan), it seemed that, in lean times, to continue eating foie gras and butter in moderation was the wisest thing to do.
The French don't seem to be any the worse for it. In 1988, 21 percent of them said they were on a diet, according to the dairy trade board. Last year, that figure fell to 17 percent, as more and more products on market shelves bragged of their "good whole milk taste." Only 15 percent of the population is overweight.
But the French need to guard against complacency. Dr. Bellisle says that, with their increasingly sedentary habits, the "French paradox" -- remaining thin while eating fatty foods -- may become a thing of the past. "In 10 or 15 years," she warns, "we will be just like you."
But even then, it's probably safe to say, there will be no market for olestra.

HEADLINE: Coup in Africa Frightens Democratic Neighbors

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: NIAMEY, Niger, Feb. 1

 BODY:
In a fragrant courtyard in this desert's-edge capital, a spokesman at army headquarters busies himself explaining how the military will bring about a "march toward democracy."
But less than a week after a coup that overthrew the country's first democratically elected President, the expression of cocky relaxation worn by young soldiers sitting in the shade, idly fingering their automatic weapons, suggests that they are already relishing being in charge. 
 It is a taste acquired through long experience. After only three turbulent years of experimentation with Western-style democracy in 36 years of independence from France, Niger's coup, for many here accustomed to military rule, was above all a return to normal.
Niger's coup, the first in French-speaking Africa since an era of multi-party politics began at the turn of the decade, came on the heels of one in Sierra Leone in January, on the eve of scheduled multiparty elections there.
The takeover in Niger has sent a chill throughout this region, where elected governments are receiving dwindling international support while they face mounting discontent over sinking economic fortunes.
According to the colonel who led the coup, it was justified by an increasingly volatile political stalemate between a president and a prime minister who came from rival political parties and ethnic groups.
"We knew that our intervention would not win us applause internationally," Lieut. Col. Bare Ibrahim Mainassara, the 46-year-old coup leader, in an interview. "It doesn't go with the winds of these times. But we could not watch while our country became another Somalia."
While Washington and Paris condemned the army takeover here and quickly suspended their economic assistance, Niger's new authorities seemed more surprised by the breadth of denunciations that rained down upon them from the immediate region.
In neighboring Mali, one of West Africa's most vibrant democracies, the Government immediately called for "political and diplomatic isolation and a boycott of the putschists." Other countries with less well established democratic practices, from Chad and Togo to Guinea, likewise condemned the coup, perhaps fearing that their armies might be inspired to copy it.
[On Friday, Reuters reported that soldiers in the West African state of Guinea were holding the capital, Conakry, to protest low pay, and President Lansana Conte said they were trying to overthrow him. A shell exploded near the presidential palace, and it was reported to be in flames.]
For foreign powers, especially France, which provides as much as 45 percent of the country's budget, the takeover by Niger's army, which left six dead, represented an embarrassing predicament.
If they do nothing, many diplomats say, other fledgling democracies in West Africa will quickly face similar military challenges. But if they move to freeze out a country that already faces difficulties feeding its population and paying salaries, diplomats here say that the result would be increased hunger and quickening desertification in Niger, and more political unrest.
American diplomats have little discretion over their aid budget of approximately $25 million. United States law requires an immediate end to aid to countries where elected governments are overthrown by force.
Diplomats say that Washington is holding out for a return to office of Niger's elected leaders. In order to maintain pressure toward this goal, the White House said in a statement this week that, in addition to withholding bilateral assistance, Washington would "not support any new programs" in the international financial institutions like the World Bank, which provide critical budgetary support for Niger.
"The U.S. support for democracy is not one that takes into account the problems that might occur along the way," said one Western diplomat. "From the American perspective, conflict in democracy is not something to be dreaded or to be seen as an excuse for military intervention."
If France publicly supports the same goal, however, many here feel that Paris, which is the region's diplomatic powerhouse, is already positioning itself to help the country's new authorities, who today named a new interim government composed entirely of civilians.
"We must, in my view, find some way out of this," said one European diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Already, the Colonel has taken a step forward in naming a new prime minister with serious qualifications. The rest will have to come with time."
For many African diplomats, this kind of nuanced view, in a region where so many governments take their cues directly from Paris, is potentially as dangerous a precedent as the coup itself.
"We had been told only recently that France was committed to defending democratic governments wherever they came under threat or attack within its sphere of influence in Africa," said a senior diplomat from one neighbor of Niger. "Now we seem to be hearing that if things get sticky and you break the impasse by breaking the rules of the democratic game, Paris will settle with you after a decent interval. All you have to do is make the right noises."

HEADLINE: The Flat-Tax Debate

 BODY:
In pushing his flat-tax proposal, Steve Forbes contends that past tax cuts have caused an increase in Federal revenue, but that claim by the Republican Presidential candidate is difficult to document. Almost all economists agree that the taxes the Government collects depend much more on the economy than on the tax rate, and they point out that the American economy usually grows each year.

HEADLINE: His Accent Just Right, Chirac Plies His Charms

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 2

 BODY:
When the President of France came calling in Chicago today, John Bryan, the head of Sara Lee, praised him for once receiving an unusual but special honor: a certificate of honor from Howard Johnson's "for artistry in making banana splits."
Making banana splits was not all that Jacques Chirac did when he worked as a part-time counterman while studying at Harvard University in the 1950's. Over lunch he told Mr. Bryan and 500 other members of Chicago's business and political elite that Howard Johnson's "also had a very good turkey sandwich, which I did very very well." The audience loved it. 
 When Gloria Scoby, a senior executive with Crain's Publications, presented him with a gift of appreciation, Mr. Chirac kissed both her cheeks, saying, "I'm in the habit, when given a gift by a very nice-looking girl, to kiss her."
And in his toast at a dinner in his honor at the Art Institute of Chicago, Mr. Chirac lauded Chicago as "a city whose nobility and grandeur are the symbol of America which has made us dream and which still makes us dream."
Mr. Chirac may be defined by his right-of-center politics and studiously cultivated air of arrogance both at home and in the corridors of power in Washington, but out in America, he tried to come across as a man of the people. It is all part of his charm offensive, as he uses his slang-tinged English to sell himself and his country to America.
After all, how many world leaders -- or French politicians for that matter -- could go on CNN's "Larry King Live," as Mr. Chirac did during a visit to New York last fall, and reminisce about the time he worked in an Anheuser-Busch factory in St. Louis and the time he produced a French newspaper about the Port of New Orleans?
"The first paper who printed my name was the Times-Picayune," he told his host, long before he became famous back home.
And who would expect the President of France to invite a group of American journalists to dine at a New York steak house, as Mr. Chirac did last fall, order a couple of beers and tell one of his female guests to choose the wines for the table?
Today, Mr. Chirac, who spent 18 years as Mayor of Paris, took his motorcade to Crane High School set in the midst of the housing projects on Chicago's West Side. With Mayor Richard Daley at his side, Mr. Chirac listened intently as educators, parents and students explained how a special training program brings parents and teachers together to nurture inner-city students and teach them how to get jobs.
"Did you have some problems with the teachers when you began to involve the parents?" he asked. "Isn't that a kind of interference?"
He wanted to know how many schools used the training program, how many students were involved, what percentage of students dropped out before graduation and the extent of the drug problem.
At the end of the 75-minute encounter, Laparis Thompson, a parent, said, "If you want to fly us to France, we'll do that, too."
"I'll think about it," Mr. Chirac replied. "It would probably be useful but it would be a hard job to convince our teachers."
But Mr. Chirac's main mission in coming to Chicago a day after his state visit to Washington was to sweet-talk American business executives into buying French.
He was so eager to come that when snow threatened to close down Andrews Air Force Base and doom his mid-morning departure from Washington on Friday, he decided to leave after the formal state dinner at the White House after midnight on Thursday night, arriving at his Chicago hotel at 5:30 A.M.
There was a time in French history when President Charles de Gaulle dismissed a visiting Japanese Prime Minister as a "transistor salesman" when he showed up in Paris and tried to peddle his country's goods.
But that was then, in the days when diplomacy was all about counting warheads, and this is now, when counting profits is what counts.
No matter that France has just suffered the most serious strikes in a decade. No matter that the French Government and the labor unions are headed for another crash.
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have confidence in France and in the winning cards we hold," Mr. Chirac told his audience at lunch. He even boasted that the per-capita growth of exports is higher in France than, mon dieu, the United States or Japan.
Mr. Chirac knows well that the stakes here are much higher than next fall's sales of Beaujolais Nouveau. Franco-American economic competition has become so cutthroat that France felt compelled last year to expel a number of Americans who were accused of spying on its economy. Spying by the Central Intelligence Agency helped the United States beat out France for a billion-dollar satellite and communications system in the Amazon.
So, Mr. Chirac can be excused for reaching the same conclusion that Bill Clinton did early in the Presidency: when consumer spending is down, the only way for a head of state to make his country's economy grow is to transform himself into salesman to the world.
Not everyone in the audience was convinced by Mr. Chirac's pitch. "The impression around the world is that France has rather protectionist policies and is not so anxious to compete with American interests," one man said.
"He's kidding," Mr. Chirac replied, pausing for effect. "I even think he's pulling my leg. No, France is not protectionist. We think the United States is protectionist. And we are right."
So perfect was his timing that the audience laughed in approval.

HEADLINE: THE BOSNIA ACCORD: IN WASHINGTON;
U.S. Denies Aiding Saudis In Arming The Bosnians

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Senior American officials adamantly denied a report today that the United States had collaborated with Saudi Arabia in a secret operation to funnel arms to the Bosnian Government.
An unidentified Saudi official was quoted in The Washington Post today as saying: "It was more than just turning a blind eye to what was going on. . . . It was consent combined with covert cooperation." 
 Senior American officials from the Pentagon to the State Department to the White House dismissed the assertion as untrue. They said the United States neither encouraged nor assisted the Saudi effort. Indeed, several questioned the Saudi official's claim that Saudi Arabia had contributed as much as $300 million in cash and arms to the Bosnian Government over the last three years.
If confirmed, the report would be an embarrassment for the Clinton Administration. For more than a year, British and French officials have insisted that the United States was covertly violating the United Nations arms embargo on shipments to the Bosnian Government. The Administration has repeatedly denied the charges.
Saudi Arabia has an immensely complicated relationship with the United States in which both sidesquietly do favors for each other, and occasionally put pressure on each other to do more. Sometimes that pressure is exerted privately, sometimes through press disclosures.
American officials said they were not aware of any specific point of contention between Washington and Riyadh. One official speculated that the Saudis might be trying to elbow aside the Iranians, who have publicly acknowledged helping the Muslim-led Bosnian Government.
Adel al-Jubeir, a spokesman for Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, said he could neither confirm nor deny reports about covert actions.
The United States and Saudi Arabia have previously cooperated on covert operations. In the 1980's, the Saudis provided billions of dollars to underwrite the Central Intelligence Agency's arming of the Afghan rebels, and at the request of American officials the Saudis spent millions to arm the Nicaraguan rebels in the Iran-contra operation.
In his interview with The Post, the Saudi official likened the Bosnia operation to the covert efforts in Afghanistan. The United States and the Saudis, he said, turned to a "network" of arms dealers and "former this and former that" who could be trusted to arrange deliveries.
American officials emphatically denied this, and said anyone who helped the Saudis smuggle weapons to Bosnia did so without encouragement from any American official.
The question of arming the Bosnian Government arose almost as soon as war broke out in Bosnia in April 1992. The Clinton Administration lobbied unsuccessfully for a lifting of the embargo against arms shipments to the Balkan factions, while various nations -- including Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran -- made it clear they would try to help their Muslim brethren. An Iranian jetliner carrying 4,000 rifles and a million rounds of ammunition was intercepted in Zagreb, Croatia, in 1992.
American intelligence agencies gathered detailed information about which countries were smuggling weapons to the Bosnians. But the United States, American officials said, did not press those nations to stop violating the arms embargo. This could have been viewed, an official said, as a "nod and wink."
The United States, several officials said, felt no obligation to enforce the embargo on other countries, and in October 1994 Congress barred the Administration from sharing any intelligence that could be used to interdict arms shipments to the Bosnian Government.
But at the same time it was turning a blind eye to arms shipments to the Bosnian Government, the Administration used all of its diplomatic muscle to shore up the economic embargo against Serbia.
Last year, there were several European press reports about mysterious flights by American-made transport planes into the Tuzla airfield in Bosnian Government territory. Administration officials said the planes were not American and suggested they might have been sent by Turkey, another supporter of the Bosnian Government. American officials said today that the United States did not raise the issue with the Turks.
"This Administration always felt the embargo was unfair," one official said. Washington's argument was that the embargo merely locked in the Bosnian Government's huge disadvantage in heavy weapons.
The United States is now asking Saudi Arabia to contribute to an international effort to arm and train the Bosnian Army. Riyadh, officials said, has been noncommittal.

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL;
After the Magic, Is It Time To Believe in the Knicks?

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen toyed with them before deciding to blow them off their own floor. Now, with Thursday night's shootout victory over Orlando fresh in their minds, they are talking about such foreign concepts as "playing together" and "accepting their roles."
Here come the Knicks again, teasing their following into believing that maybe, just maybe, they have the tools and the heart to go as far as they want in the post-season. 
 The Knicks have only one problem with that thinking: soon enough, they could be in the same boat they were in on Jan. 23, after a demoralizing 99-79 loss to the Chicago Bulls. So they were more than ready to put in perspective their 110-102 victory over the Magic, the defending Eastern Conference champion, at Madison Square Garden on Thursday, even though it was their fourth straight victory.
"It was a good win, but it's nothing to get over-excited about," Charles Smith said. "We needed to play well, win or lose. And we needed everybody to handle their assignments.
"The last time we played the Bulls, it wasn't just the score. Our effort wasn't there. It was a really bad game for us. In my four years here, I can never remember not competing, not even being in the game with them. So, in that sense, it was a wake-up call for us. But to say it's anything beyond that is premature right now."
The Knicks improved to 28-15 heading into their showdown with Indiana 1 P.M. tomorrow at Market Square Arena. Though the Pacers represent the next measuring stick during a week filled with them, there is reason to believe the Knicks are moving in the right direction.
It would be easy to dismiss the victory over the Magic as an anomaly by taking into account that Orlando is not a good road team (it fell to 9-13 and lost for the seventh time in its last nine games away from home). Also, the Magic has been riddled with injuries all season, with Shaquille O'Neal and Horace Grant missing significant chunks of time.
But Orlando came into the game as healthy as it has been since last season. And the Knicks moved the ball more crisply than they had in weeks, which led to seven players scoring in double figures and New York amazingly outscoring the Magic by 18-10 on fast-break points.
The notion that the Knicks could ever come out on the winning side of a run-and-shoot contest with Orlando was preposterous a month ago. It was not just their running game, either. The Knicks made 21 of 23 free throws. They won a battle of 3-point attrition by making an economical 7 of 13. Hubert Davis made five 3-pointers in a game for the second time this season, and all of them seemed to come at the most opportune times.
Though Patrick Ewing did not make a shot in the second half, he had 23 points through two quarters and 15 rebounds for the game. Charles Oakley and Anthony Mason combined for 31 points (Mason had 21), 22 rebounds (Oakley had 14), 6 assists and all the defensive pressure O'Neal and Horace Grant could take inside.
Coach Don Nelson used the same large lineup he used often against Houston earlier this season. Mason defended against O'Neal, frustrating him with every tactic he could; Smith and Oakley tried their bests to contain Dennis Scott and Nick Anderson; Ewing's job was to limit Grant's effectiveness, and Derek Harper shadowed Anfernee Hardaway, who finished only 3 of 15 from the field.
 
 
 
REBOUNDS
 The Knicks are still playing down rumors of any major deal, simply because they have few players who are hot commodities. But there are indications they will do something before the Feb. 22 trading deadline. The team has had conversations in the past 10 days with Toronto, which is interested in DOUG CHRISTIE. Several players from the Raptors' roster have been mentioned, including WILLIE ANDERSON, ED PINCKNEY and VICTOR ALEXANDER, all of whom are in the last year of their contracts.

HEADLINE: Payrolls Fall by 201,000 Jobs; Blizzard in East Is Cited

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The unemployment rate rose and the number of payroll jobs dropped sharply in January, the Government reported today, but analysts said the blizzard that crippled the Northeast made the already sluggish economy appear in worse shape than it really was.
The Labor Department estimated that employers dropped 201,000 people from their payrolls in the biggest decline in nearly five years. Normally, such a huge drop might herald the onset of a recession, but it was impossible to make an accurate determination because the storm closed so many businesses and kept legions of service and factory workers at home. A strike of building maintenance workers in New York City accounted for part of the loss. 
 The unemployment rate, which is based on a separate survey of households, climbed two-tenths of a point, to 5.8 percent, the upper end of the range that has prevailed since late 1994. That survey, which is often out of synch with the payroll numbers, found that more people were working but that the gains were swamped by an unusually large expansion of those seeking jobs.
"The effects of the severe weather, which unfortunately I am unable to quantify with any degree of confidence, make it difficult to determine whether a change has occurred in underlying labor market trends," Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
Financial markets were left just as baffled by the job figures as the experts at the Labor Department. The value of Treasury bonds fell as long-term interest rates rose, contributing to a decline in the stock market from record heights after five consecutive daily gains. Rates on short-term Treasury securities dipped.
The Clinton Administration, for its part, suggested that the job market might have actually improved last month if it had not been for the combined force of the snowstorm and the partial, budget-related Government shutdown.
"We fully expect employment growth to resume and believe that our economy will recover fully from the blow dealt by Mother Nature," Joseph E. Stiglitz, the President's chief economic adviser, said.
The pattern of job losses tended to support the idea that the blizzard -- which covered an area embracing 25 percent of the American work force -- was the chief culprit behind the big drop. The figures for January were published on schedule, but they followed the delayed December figures by just two weeks.
There were heavy job losses in restaurants and bars, retail trade, temporary help and at schools and colleges that normally hire students for such activities as sports events.
Construction jobs rose on strong growth in some areas not affected by the storm and on the diversion of many highway construction crews in the East to snow removal.
But pinpointing the location of the job losses was made more difficult because the Labor Department, suffering from budget cuts, has discontinued publication of the unemployment rates for 11 major industrial states.
The jobless rate for adult women climbed five-tenths of a point, to 5.1 percent, which may have reflected the pressures on women to stay home with children who were kept out of school. Unemployment for adult men was unchanged at 4.9 percent.
Some analysts found more evidence of a deteriorating economy in today's report. "We are flirting with recession," the National Association of Manufacturers said. And economists at Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street investment house, told clients that "fundamental weakness continues to emerge in timely indicators that are unlikely to be distorted by freak weather."
But others said the job figures reported today grossly exaggerated the underlying economic situation. "The question is whether the weakness is cumulating, feeding on itself, or whether we're in for a bounce," said Paul D. Mastroddi of J. P. Morgan. He said the latter was more likely, arguing that recent reports on sales of homes and motor vehicles were not particularly bad and that first-time claims for unemployment insurance had not climbed markedly in recent weeks.
The most telling sign that the dismal January results were caused more by bad weather than a deteriorating economy, Mr. Mastroddi said, "is that jobless claims seem to be holding at about 375,000" through late January.
Analysts also noted that the Labor Department made upward revisions for November and December that added 56,000 jobs to earlier estimates of payroll employment.
Clearly reflecting the storm was a 1.4-hour plunge in the length of the factory workweek that also helped drag the overall private-sector work week down by 36 minutes.
Average hourly earnings, watched closely for indications of wage pressure, climbed a hefty 6 cents an hour last month, to $11.68. But Commissioner Abraham said perhaps half the increase could be attributed to the storm as a larger proportion of lower-earning workers were idled. Analysts also noted the tendency of hourly earnings to rise sharply in the first month of a new quarter.
Regional figures supplied by the Labor Department showed that unemployment fell in the Northeast to 5.8 percent from 6.2 percent while it rose in the West to 6.9 percent from 6.3.
Officials said this divergence from what might be expected in light of the blizzard occurred because the Labor Department, in its survey of households, counts those with jobs as employed even if their business closed or they could not reach their workplace.
There were some 1.57 million such people during last month's survey week, nearly twice as many as in any other January since the mid-1970's and nearly four times the average January.
Unemployment edged down two-tenths of a point, to 5.4 percent, in the South and one-tenth of a point, to 4.6 percent, in the Midwest, today's report also showed.

HEADLINE: Feminists Gather to Affirm Relevancy of Their Movement

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The feminist movement has encountered rough waters of late. Issues that agitated its aging leaders in their youth three decades ago -- marriage and career, abortion rights and political clout -- are taken for granted by younger women. Some social critics have declared the movement irrelevant, out of touch, even dead.
About 3,000 women gathered here today in an effort to dispel those notions. They are participating in Feminist Expo '96, a three-day conference of meetings, displays and networking organized by the Feminist Majority Foundation, a nonprofit group. 
 The event is co-sponsored by 299 groups, including Emily's List, a political fund-raising organization, the United Farm Workers, Women in Film and the Young Women's Christian Association of the U.S.A.
"We want to end this discussion about the death of feminism," said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation. "We want to reframe the debate for the 21st century."
Ms. Smeal said there was no dearth of issues that women should be concerned about, from debate over the Federal budget to efforts in California and other states to repeal affirmative-action policies. She and other feminist leaders here said a women's movement was needed today more than ever exactly because many young women assumed that rights they took for granted could not be rolled back.
"We've changed the roles of women and men substantially," Ms. Smeal said. But "make no mistake, there is a backlash now exactly because of our success."
Another participant, Gloria Steinem, came to the event fresh from the successful campaign for Ron Wyden, a liberal Oregon Democrat who won the Senate seat left vacant when Bob Packwood resigned in disgrace over accusations of sexual and official misconduct. Feminists had to gear up to fight for affirmative action and "rescue women who have fallen into a river of discrimination," Ms. Steinem said.
As if to confirm her observation, the American Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession released a report today asserting that despite the large number of women in law schools, "too many women still experience debilitating gender bias and discrimination in various forms."
At the same time, some of the participants at the conference acknowledge that they have often let their opponents define the debate by, for example, letting conservatives capture the family value issue.
"We get on the defensive and screw it up," said Ms. Smeal, who noted that she was "a Pittsburgh housewife with a baby on her lap" when she first became involved with the movement.
The feminist organizations, largely white middle- and upper-class in the movement's beginning in the 1960's, say they have made efforts to include women of other ethnic and economic groups. Still, the opening day's participants were overwhelmingly white, and if they were casually dressed, it was by choice, not economic necessity.
Vivian Lovell, a 28-year-old office manager of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, said she was disappointed that there was not more racial diversity at the gathering. The diversity issue had been brought up in planning sessions for the exposition, Ms. Lovell said, but no efforts were made to reach out to minority women's groups through sororities, churches, colleges and universities and by radio, which minorities use more frequently than newspapers to get their news.
"I give the feminists credit," Ms. Lovell said, "but they're keeping things in a little circle when they ought to broaden it to a big circle."
Prema Mathai-Davis, national executive director of the Y.W.C.A., said the feminist movement had suffered from stereotypes of what types of organizations were feminist.
"The Y.W.C.A. is the largest and oldest women's organization in the country," Ms. Mathai-Davis said. "That is why we're gearing up to collaborate in this fight for affirmative action. We're not against men. This fight helps men, women and children and families."
Though the movement has been less enthusiastically embraced by women in their 20's and 30's, the halls of the Sheraton Washington Hotel where the conference is being held, were swarming with young women, many of college- and high-school age. While many defined themselves as feminists, others were less comfortable with the label.
"Feminist is such a touchy word," said Susan Smith, a 17-year-old high school student from McLean, Va. "A lot of young women don't want to be called feminists because, hey, listen to Rush Limbaugh, and you've heard it all. It's equated with being lesbian, fat, ugly."
Nonetheless, Ms. Smith said she called herself a feminist if it meant "getting buck for buck what every guy makes doing the same job I'm doing, instead of 72 cents on the dollar."

HEADLINE: A Central Fiscal Argument Advanced by Forbes Proves Hard to Confirm

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 2

 BODY:
"Don't take my word for it, just look at the history books," Steve Forbes told the Rotary Club in Nashua this week. "Every time the tax burden is reduced, Government revenues go up, not down."
That is a line Mr. Forbes delivers almost verbatim day after day, speech after speech, as he campaigns for the Republican Presidential nomination. But like many other claims he makes for his flat-tax proposal -- the issue that propelled him out of the pack and into a close race with Senator Bob Dole here in New Hampshire and in Iowa -- the proposition that past tax cuts have caused an increase in Federal revenue is difficult to document. 
 The history books do show that in the years following tax cuts, the Government's tax receipts have almost always gone up. But they have also risen in the years following tax increases. In fact, except for the recession years of 1971 and 1983, Government tax collections have risen annually ever since the 1960 fiscal year.
The reason, almost all economists agree, is that the amount of taxes the Government collects depends much more on the state of the economy than on the tax rate, and normally the American economy grows each year.
So tax receipts did rise after tax rates were lowered in 1963, 1981 and 1986. And as Mr. Forbes point out, income tax revenue was $200 billion higher at the end of the 1980's than at the beginning even though the decade's two tax cuts lowered the top rate to 30 percent from 70 percent.
But Congress increased the top tax rate in 1990 and again in 1993 -- much to the dismay of Mr. Forbes -- and income tax collections in 1994 were $123 billion, or 22 percent, higher than in 1990.
"They can't have it both ways," said C. Eugene Steuerle, a top tax policy official in the Reagan Administration who is now an economist at the Urban Institute in Washington. "If every time you decrease rates it causes taxes to go up, then when rates are increased, taxes should go down. But that is not the case."
On Saturday, Mr. Forbes will hold two town meetings in New Hampshire devoted to the flat tax, a proposal that the other candidates have been forced to address because of his unexpected success with voters. Patrick J. Buchanan, Phil Gramm and Alan Keyes have produced their own versions of a flat tax, differing in varying degrees from Mr. Forbes's. Senator Dole and Lamar Alexander attack the Forbes proposal daily, arguing that it would worsen the budget deficit and raise the taxes of middle-income Americans.
Like almost all other industrialized countries, the United States has a progressive tax system, in which the tax rate increases as income rises. For individuals, the existing tax law has five tax brackets, ranging from 15 percent for most taxpayers to nearly 40 percent for the wealthiest. Most corporations pay a 35 percent tax on their profits.
For most individual taxpayers, tax return preparation is relatively simple. Almost three-quarters of them, for instance, take the standard deduction instead of itemizing their deductions. Their returns are usually no more than a page or two.
But for many others and for many businesses, the tax system can be maddeningly complicated and expensive to comply with. By some estimates, Americans spend more than $100 billion a year for lawyers, accountants and other costs related to preparing tax returns, money that could presumably be put to more productive use.
It would be impossible, Mr. Forbes says in his typical speech, to devise a system "more antifamily, antigrowth, ununderstandable, more corrupting than this monstrosity."
Mr. Forbes would set the rate for individuals and companies at 17 percent and abolish all deductions, including the one individuals are allowed for mortgage interest and the one businesses can take for the cost of their employees' health insurance. He would also end taxation altogether on interest and dividend income, capital gains, inheritances, pensions and Social Security benefits.
The first $13,000 of each individual's income, or $26,000 for a couple, would be exempt from taxes, and families could take a $5,000 exemption for each child. That means that a couple with two children would pay no taxes on income below $36,000. Today, a family of four with income of $36,000 can expect to owe about $3,000 in income taxes.
The Treasury Department has calculated that Mr. Forbes's plan would increase the budget deficit by almost $200 billion a year. To raise the same amount of revenue as the existing system, the Treasury maintains, a flat tax would have to be set at about 20 percent. Mr. Forbes dismisses these calculations as "bogus numbers."
In addition to his contention that his proposal would increase revenue, Mr. Forbes says it would cause savings and investment to grow, leading to an economic boom. Interest rates would fall to such an extent, he says, that homeowners would not miss their mortgage interest deductions. He points to states with low, flat taxes, which, he says, do better than states with high, progressive taxes.
Each of those arguments is subject to challenge.
As for savings and investment, there is little historic data showing that when taxes are low, people save and invest more. Indeed, the lowering of tax rates in the 1980's did not result in more savings. And even if another $50 billion to $100 billion was saved and invested, most economists doubt that it would improve economic growth by more than a small fraction of a percent each year.
On the matter of interest rates, many economists believe that lowering taxes would actually cause rates to rise. The reason, says Benjamin M. Friedman, an economist at Harvard, is that tax cuts tend to stimulate the economy. That could lead either to inflation, which would be followed by higher rates, or to a rate rise by the Federal Reserve in an effort to head off inflation.
And Prof. Michael Wasylenko, an economist at Syracuse University who has written widely about the issue of state taxes and job creation, says he has seen little evidence that state income taxes have anything to do with economic growth.
For instance, Pennsylvania, with a 2.3 percent flat tax on all income, has had a poor economy for decades. And in Minnesota, which has one of the nation's highest and most progressive state income taxes, the economy is as strong as it is almost anywhere else in the country.

HEADLINE: Clinton Order Discouraging Striker Replacement Is Voided

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
In a blow to the nation's labor unions, a Federal appeals court today voided a Presidential order intended to penalize companies that in effect discharge workers who strike.
The decision, issued by a unanimous three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, held that in issuing the order last March, President Clinton violated labor law that the courts have interpreted as permitting employers to replace strikers with permanent nonunion recruits. 
 The President's next step is an appeal to either the entire appeals court or the Supreme Court. In a statement issued while he was campaigning today in New Hampshire, Mr. Clinton said, "I strongly believe that this executive order is economically sound, fair and legal, and accordingly I am instructing my Justice Department to take all appropriate steps to have this decision overturned."
The Presidential order applied to all businesses holding Federal contracts of more than $100,000 -- that is, virtually every large Government contractor, from motel chains to aircraft builders. The order instructed the Labor Department to cancel contracts with companies that permanently replaced striking workers and to bar such companies from future contracts.
Six plaintiffs, led by the United States Chamber of Commerce, sued to have the order voided. But they were rebuffed by a lower court, which held that the President had authority to establish Government procurement policy and that the judiciary therefore had no standing to review Mr. Clinton's directive.
That finding was overturned today by the appeals court's decision, which was issued by Judges Laurence H. Silberman, nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan; David B. Sentelle, another Reagan nominee, and A. Raymond Randolph, a nominee of President George Bush.
The appeals panel held that the President's right to set procurement policy did not permit what the judges found to be an effect of Mr. Clinton's order: an undermining of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, under which, the courts have held, employers may permanently replace strikers.
John J. Sweeney, president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, which represents 13 million unionized workers, called the decision "simply wrong."
"This ruling," Mr. Sweeney said in a statement, "serves those employers who want to wage war on workers and hurts the rest of us -- working families, communities, fair employers, our nation."
The plaintiffs were elated. Stephen Bokat, general counsel for the United States Chamber of Commerce, called the decision "a total vindication of our position and a total repudiation of the President's position."
The right to replace striking workers, Mr. Bokat said, "is a key economic weapon in dealing with unions and dealing with strikes."
But Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said there was an important broader issue involved in opposing permanent replacement.
"The President," Mr. Reich said, "has the authority to make sure that taxpayers get the quality of goods and services that they deserve in a timely way from reliable Federal contractors. Strikes involving permanent replacement workers are potentially longer, more bitter and compromise the quality of goods produced. We don't want American service men and women in Bosnia driving around in tires made by replacement workers."
The threat of permanent replacement, a tactic that employers rarely used until the early 1980's, has terrified unions and blunted their ability to use strikes as their principal weapon in labor-management disputes. Strikes involving 1,000 or more workers averaged 352 a year in the 1950's, but the average has plunged to 39 in the 1990's.
Organized labor sees the erosion of its power to strike as a leading cause of a two-decade-long decline in inflation-adjusted wages and an accompanying decline in union membership and union influence in Congress and political campaigns.
Late in 1993, labor almost won legislation prohibiting the use of permanent replacements. But after the bill had been passed by the House of Representatives, it died on the Senate floor in the face of a certain filibuster.
Then, last year, Mr. Clinton issued his executive order. The directive followed a period in which the President had infuriated labor with his support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, and, amid a political climate that unions saw as increasingly threatening, it stood out as a rare Government response to their complaints.
Now, the court decision overturning the order could accelerate a trend among unions in bypassing Congress, the courts and the National Labor Relations Board to press their interests. Many are now resorting to what they call corporate campaigns, putting pressure on employers by demonstrating at their centers around the country and discouraging their suppliers from doing business with them.
And with the election of the militant Mr. Sweeney as A.F.L.-C.I.O. president late last year, labor is also threatening campaigns of civil disobedience. "Progress has mainly been where unions have exercised rights outside normal regulatory procedures," said Jon Hiatt, the labor federation's general counsel. "Decisions like this convince unions to give up on the N.L.R.B. and the courts, and take to the streets."
Mr. Clinton's order never led to the cancellation of a Government contract with any employers, although it is hard to say how many of them refrained from using permanent replacements for fear of losing such contracts.
The Chamber of Commerce was joined in the challenge to the order by two manufacturers, Bridgestone-Firestone Inc. and Mosler Inc.; the American Trucking Associations; the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Labor Policy Association, an employer advocate.

HEADLINE: How Fed Made Decision To Cut Rates in December

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers listed the possibility of an economic slowdown and low inflation as reasons for their decision in December to reduce a key interest rate, minutes of their meeting showed today.
Members of the the Fed's policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, agreed 11 to 0 to reduce the Federal funds rate on overnight loans among banks to a target of 5.5 percent from 5.75 percent at the Dec. 19 meeting. 
 On Wednesday, the Fed policy makers cut the Federal funds another quarter-point, to 5.25 percent. Minutes of that session will not be available for several more weeks.
The full Fed board also voted 5 to 0 this week to lower the more symbolic discount rate on Fed loans to member banks a quarter-point, to 5 percent.
The F.O.M.C. meets eight times a year at intervals of five to eight weeks. Deliberations are secret, although the minutes later outline the reasoning behind the Fed officials' decisions.
The minutes from Dec. 19 released today showed the Fed policy makers concluded that "inflation and inflationary expectations moderated" and that "the downside risks to the expansion appeared to have increased," although there were no outright signs at the time of an economic slowdown.
Some members of the panel would have settled for leaving interest rates unchanged because they saw "little hard evidence" to suggest the inflation rate would slow further, the minutes said.

Apple's investors have been trading in the dark for weeks, despite standards calling for prompt public disclosure. [38.]
 
Long Treasury Bonds Tumble
In the bond market, prices fell for longer maturities as traders reacted to the uncertainty created by the Goverment's report that jobslessness had risen in January to 5.8 percent, but mainly because of the Northeastern blizzard. Traders feared the report masked a stronger economy with inflationary pressures gathering strength. The 30-year bond dropped 110/32 , to 10922/32 for a yield of 6.16 percent. [49.]
 
Blue chip stocks fell, following bonds down. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 31.07 points, to 5,373.99, marking its first falloff in six sessions, but the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index advanced 2.65 points, to a high of 1,072.11. Telecommunications shares fell in response to Thursday's passage of deregulation. [39.]
 
Business Yielding to Greens
Leading business groups, yielding to opposition from environmentalists, are beginning to advise Senator Bob Dole and other Republican leaders in Congress to scale back ambitious proposals to restrict Federal regulatory powers. Some business leaders say they might even settle for merely writing into law an order President Clinton issued in 1993 telling regulatory agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, to pay more attention to the costs their regulations impose on business. [1.]
 
Grace Rebuffs Bid by Baxter
W. R. Grace & Company brushed aside a $3.8 billion bid by Baxter International for National Medical Care, Grace's big chain of kidney dialysis centers, hinting that it was considering more lucrative offers. Investors, hoping for a bidding war, drove Grace shares up $7.375, to $69.25. Baxter shares dropped $2.50, to $42.50. [37.]
 
Merry-Go-Round to Liquidate
Merry-Go-Round Enterprises, a retailer that clothed America's teen-agers for more than two decades, said it would liquidate its 536 stores and cease operations. The chain filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code two years ago, but it was never able to reorganize profitably. [37.]
 
A Worrisome S.E.C. Stance
The fine print of the Securities and Exchange Commission's settlement last week of securities fraud charges against Orange County, Calif., is distressing two very different groups. Public officials across the country are anxious that the S.E.C. intends to scrutinize more closely their handling of municipal bond issues, and eight leading Wall Street firms, particularly Merrill Lynch, are worried about a continuing S.E.C. investigation.

HEADLINE: Businesses Scaling Back Plans To Defang Federal Regulations

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Leading business groups are beginning to advise allies in Congress to scale back their ambitious proposals if they hope to pass stalled legislation restricting Federal regulatory powers.
Legislation was passed by the House last year as part of the Contract With America, but it died in the Senate when Democrats condemned it as an effort to roll back a generation of environmental progress. Senator Bob Dole, the bill's principal advocate in the Senate, and other Republican leaders have promised to try to revive it. 
 Many backers of restrictions on regulatory agencies concede that the only bill that seems likely to be passed would be a far cry from the radical regulatory overhaul that the Republicans once proposed, with intense support from business groups.
Throughout last year, that coalition, with the support of a few Democrats, pushed a bill that would have changed how all environmental statutes are implemented without amending any of them. The measure would have required elaborate cost-benefit studies of major rules and opened significant new opportunities for industry to challenge regulations in court.
But now, some business leaders say they might even settle for merely writing into law an order President Clinton issued in 1993 telling regulatory agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, to pay more attention to how much their regulations cost businesses.
The tactical retreat comes as Democratic opposition to changes in environmental laws is intensifying, the White House is claiming environmental protection as a central election issue, and one poll after another suggests that the public thinks that the Republicans tried to take regulatory changes too far.
"We have certainly trimmed our sails," said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers and the main spokesman for the corporate coalition lobbying for regulatory changes. Mr. Jasinowski said the group was urging "more modest changes that could garner bipartisan support."
Industry leaders say their efforts last year were intended to remove unnecessary and burdensome regulation. But they add with dismay that the debate over regulation has left them painted as polluters intent on undoing environmental protections. Like the Republican Congressional leaders, some industry leaders have recently been anguishing over how to recast their environmental messages.
Until new proposals are made public, it is impossible to judge whether industry genuinely wants a compromise or is making a public-relations foray meant to improve its image and its chances of success. Congress is in recess, so no legislative action is expected right away.
An approach that is being widely discussed would be to adopt the terms of an executive order on regulatory practices that was issued in 1993 by Mr. Clinton. The order instructed agencies to balance costs and benefits when writing rules to carry out laws like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, but it did not provide industry with any grounds for legal challenges.
"That executive order was pretty good," said Fred Webber, the head of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, in a news conference this week.
That kind of talk is an abrupt change from last year, when industry groups fought hard against softer alternatives, like a bipartisan bill offered by Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, and Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island.
Now corporate lobbyists are asking themselves how much they can realistically expect to achieve in an election year.
A meeting on Dec. 12 at the American Petroleum Institute, for example, led off with a review of what happened last year, according to notes taken by one participant.
"Industry lost the battle and regulatory reform has become a political football," said the minutes, taken by an American Petroleum Institute consultant, Arnold Moore.
"It may not be addressed again until 1997, if ever," his notes said. "Some attendees concluded that there must be a change in how we think and talk about regulatory reform and the environment."
Mr. Moore's notes fell into the hands of an environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, which provided them to The New York Times. Greg Wetstone, the environmental group's legislative director, described the notes as proof that the industry was discussing "not how to make their proposals less destructive, but how to mislead the American public with better packaging."
The meeting was attended by Charles DiBona, the head of the oil industry trade association; five of its staff members, and supporters from groups like Resources for the Future, a resource organization; the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a pro-business group, and the Center for Risk Analysis at Harvard University, an academic program financed by industry.
Mr. Moore's notes do not disclose who said what, but they describe soul-searching over big business's failure to push through a bill that was among its highest priorities.
"There was a perception that the special interests wrote the bill," the notes said, "and the public was very unhappy about that.
"While industry may not have been seeking a general rollback of environmental regulation, some Republican Congressmen were, and some want to abolish E.P.A."
The notes went on, "It would be great progress if the Administration should offer the 1993 executive order as regulatory reform legislation."
But Administration officials said it all depended on how the legislation was written. The Administration wants to retain the flexibility it is allowed under current law and avoid opening Federal regulations to endless litigation.
That is exactly what some environmentalists say will happen if the executive order becomes law, said Gary Bass, the executive director of O.M.B. Watch, an advocacy group that monitors regulatory affairs.
On the other hand, some advocates of rolling back regulations say they oppose watering down the original Republican bills.
"Something that is not enforceable in the courts and does not impose real accountability on agencies does not accomplish much," said Jonathan Adler, a spokesman for the Competitive Enterprise Institute. "Clinton's executive order is a perfect example."
But Mr. Adler acknowledged that "most industry folks want a bill."
"I get the impression," he added, "that there are a lot of lobbyists in this town who want to say, 'We got a bill -- I earned my keep.' "

Still All Girls, Still Teaching Self-Reliance

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
THE fetal shark lay split open on the dissecting tray, like a clay toy steeped in formaldehyde. A nearby index card read: "What Sex Am I?"
Liz Kay glanced at it briefly. 
 "I think it's male," she said.
No question, the girls at this school know a lot about sex roles, science labs and plenty of other subjects. And there's no doubt who's in charge.
Miss Kay and her friends attend the Academy of Mount Saint Ursula in the Bronx, which was founded in 1855 and is the state's oldest all-girls Roman Catholic high school. Although it predates the women's suffrage, civil rights and feminist movements, its students think it's hardly anachronistic. They feel that the company of women gives them a sense of confidence that would be lost in a co-ed school where boys vie for the teacher's attention (and the girls' affections).
"I don't have to worry about all the guys taking over," said Christine Balubayan, a senior who helped Miss Kay lead a tour for prospective students on Tuesday. "Girls have all the power to speak here. In co-ed schools, some of the teachers would only pick on the guys. The guys take over and the girls feel intimidated."
Indeed, a 1992 report by the American Association of University Women warned that girls were being "shortchanged" in co-ed schools where teachers paid less attention to them. And while girls start out school on the same footing as boys, they often lag behind them by the end of high school, especially in math and science.
It's an age-old problem. There's an equally old solution, at least if you know about St. Angela Merici, who started the Ursuline order in 1535 when she gathered a group of women to educate them in the faith.
"The value of the education of women has been a strong one, even going back to the 16th century," said Sister Mary Beth Read, the school's principal. "Women originally were not taught to read because nobody thought it was worth it. But St. Angela talked about women's dignity and work."
AT her school, a young woman's place is anywhere she wants to be.
"The studies confirm what we seem to know from instinct," Sister Mary Beth said. "We have a certain gift to give young women that they may not be getting elsewhere. We help them develop leadership ability."
You'd think it would be tough to pitch an all-girls school in an age when even some football teams are co-ed. "It's not hard to sell it to their parents," Miss Balubayan said. "My father jumped for joy when he found out I wanted to go here."
Parents nodded in approval as Miss Kay and Miss Balubayan led them through the school's winding halls, past labs, chapels and classrooms. The Bronx eighth graders listened intently as the seniors talked about traditions, like the annual roller-skate journey to the campus Ring Day ceremony.
Even at their young age, the prospective students spoke clearly of what they could expect in a co-ed high school: more of what they experienced in grammar school.
"If you answer a question wrong, the boys go 'Duh!' " said Jessica Matthew, of the Holy Family parish school. "It's annoying."
It's not the only adolescent ritual to irk them.
"You have less distractions without the boys," said Tara Lozada, who graduates this year from Blessed Sacrament grammar school. "Most of the boys look at the girls and the girls worry about how they look."
No wonder the blue blazer and plaid skirt uniforms appealed to her.
"You don't have to worry about picking out your clothes," she said. "And they're cute uniforms."
THE nuns don't wear their uniforms anymore. Their black and white wimples have long since given way to demure business suits. But they insist on clinging to their all-girl tradition, despite the economic arguments that they could better cover the school's operating costs if they admitted boys. They see a greater cost not found on any balance sheet.
"I can remember 15 or 20 years ago people were saying that schools should go co-ed and many women's colleges did that," Sister Mary Beth said. "There is a danger with us: are the students ready for co-ed colleges and careers where the world is mixed? But our graduates say they have more self-confidence and are not shy about speaking up or asking questions."
The only question left for Miss Kay was where to go to college. She's already applied to "half the Ivy League" and a few other schools. Although some have been around longer, few can match her high school.
"Just the history alone of this school shows that it's not just you," she said. "We have 140 classes of alumni. One hundred and forty classes of people who survived and have gone forward as young women."

HEADLINE: Gene Kelly, Dancer of Vigor and Grace, Dies

BYLINE: By ALBIN KREBS 

 BODY:
Gene Kelly, the dancer, actor, director and choreographer who brought a vigorous athleticism, casual grace and an earthy masculinity to the high romance of lavish Hollywood musicals, died yesterday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 83.
His longtime publicity agent, Warren Cowan, said Mr. Kelly had never fully recovered from strokes he suffered in 1994 and last year. 
 Mr. Kelly's highly developed sense of the possibilities of dance on film invigorated classic musicals like "Anchors Aweigh," "On the Town," "An American in Paris" and "Singin' in the Rain."
A gifted dancer with his own vibrant style, he also flourished as an innovative choreographer and director in the 1940's and 50's, the heyday of the big, splashy Hollywood musical.
Mr. Kelly, who could also put over a song in a high, thin voice, brought to his films an inventive technique that enabled him to create unusual and imaginative dance routines that usually arose directly out of a plot or script situation.
Thus millions of moviegoers remember Mr. Kelly dancing merrily in a downpour in "Singin' in the Rain," hoofing with an animated mouse, Jerry, in "Anchors Aweigh," hopping over garbage cans in a sequence in "It's Always Fair Weather" and, with the aid of special process photography, dancing with himself in the "alter ego" number from "Cover Girl."
In addition to his movies, which included "The Pirate," "Brigadoon" and the drama "Inherit the Wind," Mr. Kelly was also a star on Broadway, where he created the title role of the heel as hero in "Pal Joey," choreographed "Best Foot Forward" and directed Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Flower Drum Song."
"I don't really know why I clicked," Mr. Kelly said many years later. "I didn't want to be a dancer. I just did it to work my way through college. But I was always an athlete and gymnast, so it came naturally.
"In the 1930's, when I started, Martha Graham was the only dancer doing anything modern, but she did it all to classical music. I couldn't see myself doing 'Swan Lake' every night, and I wanted to develop a truly American style. The only dancer in the movies at that time with any success was Fred Astaire, but he did very small, elegant steps in a top hat, white tie and tails. I was too big physically for that kind of dancing, and I looked better in a sweatshirt and loafers anyway. It wasn't elegant, but it was me."
Eugene Curran Kelly was born on Aug. 23, 1912, in Pittsburgh. His mother insisted that all five of the Kelly children take music and dance lessons, and in high school Mr. Kelly continued dance lessons while also playing on the football and hockey teams. His education at Pennsylvania State College was interrupted by the Depression, and his first job was teaching gymnastics at a summer camp for boys.
He was later able to major in economics at the University of Pittsburgh and received a degree in 1933, but jobs were scarce and he went to work for a dancing school partly owned by his mother. Two years later, the school was renamed the Gene Kelly Studio of the Dance and soon a successful branch was opened in Johnstown.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kelly directed plays produced locally and formed a dance act with his brother Fred, with whom he performed in a theater for children at the Chicago World's Fair in 1934. In the mid-1930's Mr. Kelly also redirected vaudeville acts that passed through Pittsburgh.
Mr. Kelly did not decide to try his luck in New York until 1938, when he was 27 years old. His first job was as a Broadway chorus boy in 1938's "Leave It to Me," dancing while Mary Martin sang "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," but the next year he won critical acclaim for his featured role as the comic hoofer in William Saroyan's play "The Time of Your Life."
That success led to his being cast in "Pal Joey," the 1940 Rodgers and Hart musical, in which he played the unscrupulous central character so convincingly that John Martin, a critic for The New York Times, said, "He is not only glib-footed, but he has a feeling for comment and content that give his dancing personal distinction and raise it several notches as a dancing art."
Mr. Kelly's ability to meld singing and dancing with characterization and the demands of the play's plot attracted so much notice that David O. Selznick signed him to an exclusive Hollywood contract. At the time, Mr. Kelly was appearing in "Pal Joey" at night and by day choreographing the Broadway musical hit "Best Foot Forward."
In 1941, he left for Hollywood, where he was to bring a new vitality to dance on film and help change the whole concept of movie musicals.
Mr. Selznick had no musicals planned, however, and lent Mr. Kelly to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the studio most noted for lavish musicals. His first film, in 1942, was "For Me and My Gal," in which he starred as a small-time vaudeville hoofer opposite Judy Garland.
It was a huge success, but MGM, after buying the new star's contract from Mr. Selznick, relegated him to relatively minor parts in "DuBarry Was a Lady," "Thousands Cheer," and the wartime drama "Cross of Lorraine."
In "Cover Girl," co-starring with Rita Hayworth in 1944 on loan to Columbia Pictures, Mr. Kelly's career took off. With the aid of Stanley Donen, with whom he was to direct and choreograph several movies in years to follow, Mr. Kelly developed the celebrated "alter ego" solo dance with his ectoplasmic self, the character's conscience. Photographed separately, then combined on a single strip of film, the two Kelly images seemed to pursue each other up and down flights of steps, to threaten each other and leap over each other's heads.
"For once, a dance on the screen is not merely a specialty but actually develops character and advances plot," wrote a New York Times critic. The alter ego sequence and others in "Cover Girl" significantly advanced the use of movie song-and-dance numbers that evolve naturally from the plot and the action on screen.
Mr. Kelly said later: "In my first picture, I made a startling discovery. Things danced on the screen do not look the way they do on the stage. On the stage, dancing is three-dimensional, but a motion picture is two-dimensional. Also, I felt the dancer in films had never had the opportunity to probe emotional and acting problems adequately. So I tried to do things uniquely cinematic, that you couldn't do on a stage. Call it 'cine-dancing,' or whatever, but I tried to invent the dance to fit the camera and its movements."
Mr. Kelly's choreographic inventiveness was credited with the success of the trail-blazing live-dance-with-animation sequence in "Anchors Aweigh" in 1945. He had a hard time persuading MGM officials that they should spend $100,000 and two months shooting an eight-minute number, in which he would dance with Jerry the mouse from the "Tom and Jerry" cartoon series.
Simple live action and animation went back to silent-film days, but Mr. Kelly's idea involved color and intricate dance steps for himself and the cartoon characters, and required complex laboratory and processing work.
For the charming sequence, Mr. Kelly first danced against a plain blue background, then animators filmed the mouse song-and-dance portion. What audiences saw was a composite picture made from the two separate films, with man and mouse happily dancing and singing. The procedure is common now, even in television commercials, but in the mid-1940's it was hailed as a cinematic breakthrough.
Before joining the Navy in 1944, Mr. Kelly appeared with his friend Fred Astaire for the first time in a single number, Gershwin's "Babbitt and the Bromide" in MGM's opulent, star-studded "Ziegfeld Follies."
"It wasn't a battle of dancers, but our different styles were purposely made apparent," Mr. Kelly said. "My style is strong, wide open; Fred's is intimate, cool, easy. He can give an audience pleasure just by walking across a dance floor."
After the war, Mr. Kelly's first big picture was "The Pirate," a 1948 spoof of swashbuckling adventures in which he again starred with Judy Garland, with whom he sang the rousing "Be a Clown." James Agee, the critic, found Mr. Kelly's performance "very ambitious, painfully misguided, by John Barrymore out of the elder Douglas Fairbanks." In "The Three Musketeers" (1948), Mr. Kelly did not dance, but as D'Artagnan he used his balletic skills to burlesque some fencing scenes.
One of Mr. Kelly's most memorable dance performances came in the seven-minute "Slaughter on 10th Avenue" ballet sequence in "Words and Music," a 1948 movie that was only subliminally based on the lives of Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. Most critics agreed that about the only thing to cheer about the film was the Rodgers ballet, in which Mr. Kelly was partnered with Vera-Ellen.
In 1949, Mr. Kelly made two films with Frank Sinatra, "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" and one of his all-time hits, "On the Town," which he directed and choreographed with Mr. Donen and filmed mostly on location in New York City. Mr. Kelly, whose co-stars included Betty Garrett, Ann Miller and Vera-Ellen, turned the film into an exhilarating, joyful experience that began with the brassy "New York, New York (It's a Helluva Town)" opening number and never let up in its mood of pervasive effervescence.
"This film was a milestone," he said in 1977. "It was the first musical to be shot on location. We took the musical off the sound stage and showed that it could be realistic. The idea of doing such a thing was anathema to the studio moguls. We shot a lot of it in New York and showed sailors getting off their ship in the Brooklyn Navy Yard and singing and dancing through the streets of New York. You can't imagine how crazy everybody thought this was at the time, but it changed the face of musicals. The picture has dated a bit, but it's the closest to my heart."
But some of Mr. Kelly's most popular and artistically successful films were yet to come. In 1951, "An American in Paris," in which he received sole star billing, won eight Academy Awards, including best picture of the year, and a special Oscar for Mr. Kelly for his contributions to screen choreography.
An integral part of the film was a 17-minute ballet conceived by Mr. Kelly and the director, Vincente Minnelli, as a means of showing the impact Paris has on the hero. Costumes, sets and dance movements for the ballet were borrowed from the styles of such artists as Dufy, Renoir, Utrillo, Rousseau, van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec and the music danced to by Mr. Kelly and Leslie Caron was George Gershwin's "American in Paris" suite.
"Singin' in the Rain," released in 1952, was one of the last of the big MGM musicals and it was, said Vincent Canby, film critic of The New York Times, in a 1975 appraisal, "a movie masterpiece." Again teaming with Mr. Donen, Mr. Kelly helped to direct and choreograph the affectionate spoof of the start of the talkies era in movies. The movie made splendid use of such Arthur Freed-Nacio Herb Brown songs as "You Were Meant for Me," "You Are My Lucky Star" and "All I Do Is Dream of You."
In the title number, a love-struck Mr. Kelly, with an umbrella as his principal prop, sang and splashed ecstatically and obliviously through a downpour on an all-but-deserted street. The sequence is widely regarded as a classic piece of cinematic choreography.
Since it was a period piece in the first place, taking place in the Hollywood of the 1920's, when sound was revolutionizing the movie business, "Singin' in the Rain" even today does not seem dated, possibly because, as Mr. Kelly put it, "when you work in a period that was, you have some distance and a better chance to make a picture last."
Debbie Reynolds, who was 18 at the time and had her first major role in "Singin' in the Rain," had never sung or danced before, but she said years later: "I learned a lot from Gene. He is a perfectionist and a disciplinarian: the most exacting director I've worked for. And he has a good temper. Every so often he would yell at me and make me cry. But it took a lot of patience for him to work with someone who had never danced before."
In 1989, "Singin' in the Rain" was among the first 25 films chosen by the Library of Congress for its National Film Registry of significant motion pictures.
Mr. Kelly's last major musicals at MGM were "Brigadoon" (1954), a disappointment, and "It's Always Fair Weather (1955) and "Les Girls" (1957), which were both hits. In the 1950's, he also appeared in "Deep in My Heart," "Marjorie Morningstar" and "The Devil Makes Three," and he produced and directed "The Happy Road," "Tunnel of Love" and other movies.
Generally regarded as an artistic as well as a commercial failure was Mr. Kelly's ambitious project "Invitation to the Dance," a three-part, plotless dance film without dialogue released in 1956. Mr. Kelly starred in the film and directed and choreographed it. "The public wasn't ready for a serious dance film, and besides, by the time it came out, the popularity of film musicals had declined," Mr. Kelly said.
He nevertheless said he believed the public could be taught to appreciate dance, and late in 1958 conceived, wrote, narrated and danced in an NBC-TV special called "Dancing Is a Man's Game," in which he used athletes to demonstrate the sheer physicality and manliness of dance, often viewed by Americans as an effete art. That same year, Mr. Kelly returned to Broadway to direct the hit Rodgers and Hammerstein musical "Flower Drum Song,"
In 1960, Mr. Kelly was invited to write and choreograph for the Paris Opera ballet troupe a zesty modern jazz ballet, which he set to Gershwin's "Concerto in F." He gave the ballet the punning title "Pas de Dieux," and he received 23 curtain calls after its premiere. A pas de deux he created for the San Francisco Ballet in 1982 was not as enthusiastically greeted.
Over the years there were many appearances on television specials by Mr. Kelly, and he also had a weekly series on ABC-TV in 1963 called "Going My Way," in which he was seen as a priest. Mr. Kelly also continued to direct an occasional movie, including "Hello, Dolly!" in 1969 and "The Cheyenne Social Club" in 1970. His last performance on screen was dancing on roller skates in the 1980 movie "Xanadu," with Olivia Newton-John, a reprise of a number he did with his brother, Fred, years earlier. He also reminisced in the 1994 anthology film "That's Entertainment! III."
In 1994, Mr. Kelly was a recipient of the National Medal of Arts, awarded by President Clinton in a ceremony at the White House.
Mr. Kelly's first wife was the actress Betsy Blair, from whom he was divorced in 1957. They had a daughter, Kerry. In 1960, Mr. Kelly married Jeanne Coyne, who had been one of his dance students in Pittsburgh and had worked as his assistant choreographer since 1949. They had two children, Timothy and Bridget. Mrs. Kelly died in 1973. In 1990, he married Patricia Ward.

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Wicked winds, dangerous cold and misery continued to strangle much of the nation today from the heartland to the Deep South, closing schools, threatening crops, plunging neighborhoods into darkness and making the insurance industry shiver and shake as hundreds of thousands of damage claims continued to pour in from two earlier winter storms.
Temperatures plummeted today to 60 degrees below zero in tiny Tower, Minn., population 500, breaking a 97-year state record, and that was without the wind chill. In Chicago, the temperature was 15 degrees below, and the city was in its second day of a cold-weather emergency. Elsewhere, the story was the same: bruising, brutal cold. It was 30 below in Rapid City, S.D.; 34 below in Eau Claire, Wis.; 37 below in Butte, Mont., and 45 below in International Falls, Minn. 
 As New Yorkers braced for the bitter cold to arrive on Sunday and Monday, what is expected to be a third major snowstorm began late tonight. Accumulations of 6 to 12 inches are predicted. [Page 14.]
In normally balmy New Orleans, temperatures are expected to remain below freezing for the next three days, dropping this weekend to 22 degrees above zero -- maybe lower in the suburbs. It is the city's coldest weather in seven years.
"We've only gone below 20 just a few times in our history," said Robert Ricks, a forecaster for the National Weather Service in Slidell, La., near New Orleans.
Schools were closed in Louisiana, Wisconsin and the entire state of Minnesota. Gov. Arne Carlson said allowing Minnesota's schools to open would "be an invitation to tragedy."
"I don't want an 8-year-old girl standing on the corner waiting in this kind of weather for a bus that will never come," he said.
In Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, ice brought down trees and power lines, leaving tens of thousands of people without electricity. It was the kind of weather that most Southerners see only on televison.
"Somebody forgot to tell Mother Nature this is supposed to be the Deep South," Sgt. Wayne Winkler of the Louisiana State Police told Reuters.
Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency said they had not yet calculated the cost of the storms. But a spokesman for the agency, Phil Cogan, said that 12 states and the District of Columbia had already been approved for disaster relief because of heavy snows and flooding, making this winter "not unprecedented, but out of the ordinary."
At least 17 deaths have been attributed to the severe weather this week, including an 80-year-old unidentified woman who was found dead on Friday in her unheated garage in Eau Claire, Wis. Nine people have been killed in weather-related traffic accidents in the South. But with state and local officials still gathering data, the total number of deaths attributable to the cold and storms remains uncertain.
Across Louisiana, roads were closed because of ice. It was impossible to determine how many schools in the state were closed because the government office in charge of keeping count was shut because of the weather.
"It's going to be an Arctic weekend for subtropical Louisiana," Mr. Ricks said. "We figured it was going to be a harsh winter, and it's living up to its billing."
In Des Moines, where today's high temperature was 9 degrees below zero, the invasion of frigid weather did not halt the heated campaigning for the Republican Presidential caucuses. Some candidates even made light of the cold.
"This is a good place to meet," Steve Forbes told a group of voters gathered at Borea's Fine Coffee in West Des Moines. "You can get some hot coffee to warm your hands and now you can get some hot air to warm the rest of you."
The icy misery, especially in the South, was caused by a series of smaller disturbances combined with a record Arctic air mass that orginated over northern Canada last week and then rampaged through the Upper Midwest.
"It's a bizarre occurrence," said Colin Marquis, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. "This doesn't happen every year in the South. In some places, it's going to cause some serious damage."
In the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, farmers are bracing for a deep freeze that could last up to 12 hours, endangering crops of melons, sugar cane and mixed greens.
On Thursday, Gov. Kirk Fordice of Mississippi called out the National Guard and declared a winter storm emergency, as the storm brought down power lines and knocked 83,950 Mississippians into darkness.
The weather threatened livestock and livelihoods throughout the Midwest.
"It's pretty hard to keep livestock warm in this kind of weather," said William D. Storgohann, a farmer who lives near Davenport, Iowa, where the temperature was 20 degrees below zero on Thursday night and 5 below today. "They lay on each other for warmth, so you see some death loss from that.
"I'm staying inside doing paper work," he added. "There's not much I can or would do outside, that's for sure."
In Milwaukee, where winter is usually nothing more than an inconvenience, schools were closed, public libraries shut down, and high school basketball games and a bowling tournament called off.
In Chicago, where nearly 600 people perished last summer during a heat wave, the city put its new Extreme Weather Operation Plan into effect to protect people from the brutal cold.
A 24-hour command center was opened, and teams of building inspectors were dispatched to insure that landlords were supplying enough heat.
"The temperatures are going from dangerous to deadly," Mayor Richard M. Daley warned.
These are nervous times for the insurance industry. "This weather is going to really tax the insurance system," said Steven Goldstein, the vice president of the Insurance Information Institute, which represents the nation's property and casualty insurers. "There are only so many adjusters out there."
So far in 1996, Mr. Goldstein said, insurers expect to handle about 500,000 claims, totaling nearly $1 billion in losses, from two January snowstorms that walloped the Midwest and East.
"That's a lot of money, considering we're only at Feb. 2," he said.
The cold weather has hurt businesses in Chicago because so many people are staying home, said Diane Swonk, chief economist for NBD-First National Bank of Chicago.
"All told, the first quarter of 1996 looks pretty lousy from an economic standpoint," Ms. Swonk said. "And that's mostly because of the lousy weather."
But business is booming at Happy Joe's Pizza Parlor in Moline, Ill., which has set or tied low-temperature records every night since last Tuesday. The parlor's manager, Richard Henning, said he could not remember a time when the shop has had so many delivery orders.
"It's kind of hard on our poor delivery boys," he said. "I hope people are tipping them well.
"I wish people would stop calling and complaining that their pizzas arrived cold," Mr. Henning added. "You just can't get a pizza box from the car to the front door right now without it cooling off some."
The weather was cold enough to be a novelty even in places that expect harsh winters.
In northern Minnesota, Sonny Nesbitt of International Falls, which calls itself the Nation's Ice Box, made a video of boiling water being thrown into the air. "It just disintegrated," he said. "It looks like a big cloud of snow. No water hits the ground."
Although the cold forced the cancellation of outdoor events at the Badger State winter games in Wisconsin, hot-air balloonists said they were still committed to launchings on Saturday in Hudson, west of Eau Claire.
"You have to prove you are crazy," said one balloonist, Wynn Gustafson of St. Cloud, Minn. "We live in this climate. We have to make the most of it."

HEADLINE: THE CRUISE ISSUE;
New Ships in an Uncertain Climate

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL; EDWIN McDOWELL writes about travel for Business Day.

 BODY:
WHETHER or not the cruise industry's fortunes improve on 1995, when the number of passengers probably fell slightly below the 4.6 million of the preceding year, 1994, this year should go a long way toward answering questions that bear on the future of the industry.
Among them: Can the industry absorb the 13,000-plus new berths available from the seven new ships due in 1996? Did Regency Cruises' sudden shutdown last October, with half its fleet at sea, do lasting damage to consumer confidence? Will other financially shaky cruise lines fold, merge or form marketing alliances with bigger companies? Will discounting remain rampant? 
 While awaiting answers, much of the industry is treating last year as an aberration. It hopes to rekindle growth this spring and summer with those new ships, with more cruises to more places and with the biggest advertising budgets in cruising history.
One hopeful is Canaveral Cruise Line, a newcomer that is offering two-day cruises from Port Canaveral, Fla., to Freeport, the Bahamas, starting at $179 a person.
"We're going to tap into the first-time cruiser market," said Michael Kosmas, a Canaveral vice president. "Because we're in central Florida we're in a good position to attract people who visit Disney World, including international visitors, and who want to take a cruise but don't want to be at sea for long."
Owned by the Kosmas Group of New Smyrna, Fla., a family-owned company that also has 12 hotels in Florida and the Caribbean, Canaveral's ship is the 670-passenger Dolphin IV, formerly of Dolphin Cruise Line. The company's tentative mid-January start-up was delayed by record snows that closed the Baltimore shipyard where the Dolphin IV was being refurbished, but Mr. Kosmas vowed Canaveral would begin sailing this month.
A record number of cruise lines are looking to expand the third-biggest cruise market, Alaska, which with 8.4 percent of the market ranks far behind the Caribbean (50.5 percent) but within hailing distance of Europe and the Mediterranean (14.2 percent).
Five years ago, 19 cruise ships sailed to Alaska, and last year, 25. This year, despite the shutdown of Regency, 32 or 33 ships, a record number, will sail there from mid-May to mid-September, according to Larry Pimentel, the president of Seabourn Cruises.
Seabourn is one of several newcomers going to Alaska, with the 200-passenger Seabourne Pride sailing seven cruises, most of them 10-day sailings. In addition, Carnival Cruise Line will cruise Alaskan waters for the first time, with its Tropicale (1,022 passengers), while Celebrity will also make its Alaskan debut, with the Horizon (1,350). And Cunard's Sea Goddess II (118 capacity) will join the Dynasty (800) and Sagafjord (589).
Last month Kloster Cruise decided to reposition Royal Cruise Line's 1,052-passenger Crown Odyssey to Alaska this spring and summer, renaming it the Norwegian Crown.
That repositioning is the result of Royal's dissolution as a separate entity. Three of the four Royal ships -- the Crown Odyssey, the Royal Odyssey and the Star Odyssey -- are being transfered into the struggling Norwegian Cruise Line, owned by Royal's parent company, Kloster. The fourth, the 212-passenger Queen Odyssey, was bought by Seabourn, which will rename it the Seabourn Legend in July. (Passengers booked on the ships should contact their travel agents or the cruise line to learn of any changes in itinerary or price.)
Holland America and Princess Cruises will each have six ships in Alaska this season, offering a combined 220 cruises. The Princess fleet in Alaska will include the 1,950-passenger Sun Princess, the 77,000-ton behemoth that joined the fleet last November, which will increase Princess' capacity in Alaska 13 percent over last year. Royal Caribbean is increasing capacity 41 percent on its 10- and 11-day Alaska cruises, by substituting the 1,004-passenger Song of Norway for the Sun Viking, a 714-passenger ship that will be redeployed to the Far East.
Some environmentalists worry about the presence of so many ships in Alaska.
"We do not object to an increase in cruise ships going up the Inside Passage," said Dr. Edgar Wayburn, a retired San Francisco internist who is chairman of the Sierra Club's Alaska task force. (The Inside Passage is the traditional cruise route along the southeastern coastal strip that includes Juneau, Ketchikan and Sitka.) "But we object to so many cruise ships in Glacier Bay National Park, because it threatens the habitat of the humpback whale. And all those ships in a relatively small area threaten general environmental degradation."
Charles B. West, who pioneered tourism to Alaska beginning in 1947, and whose Seattle-based Alaska Sightseeing operates eight cruise ships of no more than 100 passengers, does not consider the big ships an environmental threat. "But you do get thousands of people swarming through small towns," he said, "so the quality of their Alaskan experience is being compromised."
The cruise lines deny that their ships pose a threat to the humpback whale, and say that the steady increase in Alaska-bound passengers, including many repeat passengers, is proof of the quality of Alaska cruises.
Currently, 107 cruise ships -- a maximum of two a day -- are allowed by the National Park Service into the 70-mile waters of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, at the northern end of the Inside Passage, from June through August, during the whales' 92-day breeding season.
The cruise industry and Alaska tourism interests want to increase the number of entries by 72 percent, to 184. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit initially favored the 72 percent increase, which many park service officials oppose, but with a decision expected any day, the expectation is that he will settle for a 30 percent increase, or 139 visits.
"We think that's manageable and fair," said Jim Brady, the superintendent of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. He added that the money raised from additional entries -- ships are assessed a $5 "franchise fee" for each passenger -- would help finance the park services' "biological studies on vessel-whale interaction, and our concerns about the effects of smokestack emissions on air quality."
While posted fares for a seven-day Inside Passage cruise range from about $1,000 to $2,750 a person, the increased capacity this year is almost sure to result in continued discounting.
But don't look for discounts in Alaska as deep as those in the Caribbean, where supply already exceeds demand and where capacity continues to increase.
The Celebrity Century, the gleaming 1,740-passenger ship that entered the fleet in late December 1995, will continue to sail the Caribbean year-round, and will be joined by a sister ship this December. Carnival's forthcoming 2,040-passenger Inspiration will begin sailing the Caribbean in April, while Holland America's new 1,266-passenger Veendam will debut with a series of summer Caribbean cruises. Royal Caribbean's new 1,804-passenger Splendour of the Seas, scheduled for delivery next month, will be redeployed to the Caribbean next winter after sailing in Europe.
Larry Fishkin, president of the Cruise Line travel agency in North Miami Beach, Fla., estimates that industry-wide fares will average 15 to 20 percent less this spring than in the spring of 1995. But two-for-one cruise-only fares are available on the Crystal Symphony's sailings from London to Barcelona on April 23 and from Barcelona to Athens on May 2. And Costa Cruises is offering two free nights at luxury hotels in any of five European cities, including Rome or Venice, for selected Mediterranean or Northern European cruises.
Meanwhile, most ships have started returning to the Caribbean ports that were damaged in the fall by Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn. But Star Clippers has dropped St. Thomas from the Star Flyer's eastern Caribbean itineraries and added Ponce, Puerto Rico, at least into April, when it sails to the Mediterranean for the summer. And for at least the next few months, Holland America's Ryndam will replace St. Johns in Antigua, which was hit hard by Luis last fall, with Pointe-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe, on its series of 10-day cruises to the southern Caribbean.

HEADLINE: SUNDAY February 4, 1996: MARKET RESEARCH;
Tilling City Fields

 BODY:
When the superhighway, supersprawl and supermarket came, the farmers' market that used to bring country-fresh harvests to vacuum-packed urbanites went. These days, however, city dwellers seem overfed on supers and underfed on nutrition, and the market for markets is again growing. There are now 2,000 of them across the country, roughly twice the number 15 years ago, and their revival shows no sign of letting up. Indeed, the Department of Agriculture encourages them as a means of strengthening endangered farms and vitalizing vacant lots.
If these city markets seem to make something out of nothing, maybe it's because they work at a level nothing else can. This can mean bringing Mennonite farmers together with grandmothers who grew up in the South and can read good chicken skin, at the Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia, above; or wrapping your hair with beads at $2 an inch, at the Saturday market in Eugene, Ore.; or hawking coffee beans at a booth that turns into Starbucks, at the Pike Place market in Seattle. 
 David O'Neil, director of the International Public Market Conference, a quadrennial event that opens Thursday in Philadelphia, puts it well: "Cities are so devastated economically and socially -- markets improve the soil."

HEADLINE: Stay on Their Backs

BYLINE: By Paul R. Krugman; Paul R. Krugman, author of "Pop Internationalism," is a professor of economics at Stanford University. This is his first article for the Magazine.

 BODY:
DELIGHTFUL FAIRY TALE HAS TAKEN HOLD LATELY IN SOME economic policy circles. After decades of inflation, slow growth and stagnant wages, the story goes, a restructured United States economy is poised for a glorious burst of sustained, 60's-style growth without inflation. It's a tale told by a spectrum of influential figures -- conservatives like Steve Forbes, the neo-Reaganite candidate, and Robert Bartley, editor of The Wall Street Journal, and liberal luminaries like the economist Lester Thurow and the financier-pundit Felix Rohatyn, who has recently been mentioned as a candidate for vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Like most good fairy tales, this one features a horrible monster who is blocking the path to eternal happiness. That would be Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, which controls the nation's money supply. The evil Greenspan and his colleagues, blinded by their obsession with inflation, cannot see that the economic terrain has shifted, that the economy can now grow much faster than previously without risking more inflation. Thus, to slay the inflation dragon, the Fed is keeping interest rates unnecessarily high, in a pointless war against a phantom enemy.
Editorials demanding that the Fed promote faster growth have appeared in major magazines like Business Week and U.S. News & World Report. Business groups like the National Association of Manufacturers have joined the chorus. The time has come, they all agree, for Greenspan and the Fed to get off the back of business, cut interest rates and go for growth. 
 It is indeed a delightful tale. If only it were true. In fact, the so-called revolutions in management, information technology and globalization are vastly overrated by their acolytes. While the economy is relatively healthy today, there is no evidence of a transformation so vast that we need to rewrite the basic rules of economics.
WHERE DO THESE DEMANDS FOR GROWTH COME FROM? PEOPLE LIKE Bartley and Forbes are motivated by their faith in supply-side economics. After all, the economy grew at an average rate of 3.6 percent between 1982 and 1989. Doesn't that prove that the only thing needed to bring back the boom years is to return to Ronald Reagan's policies?
 But the supply-siders have been promising rapid growth all along. The reason some centrists and liberals now join them is that they have been listening too closely to business leaders. It has become a cliche in the business world that in the last few years tighter management and sophisticated technology have led to a "productivity revolution." And since productivity is the main factor determining long-run economic growth, this productivity must surely imply that the economy is now capable of much faster growth.
For those who believe that the economy is capable of rapid growth, it is understandably frustrating that its actual performance has been so sluggish. Admittedly, America has bounced back from the recession of the early 90's, but gross domestic product -- after jogging along for a couple of years -- has again slowed to a walk. Median family income is actually lower now than in 1990. In short, the revolutionary progress that business believes it is making is not reflected in overall measures of growth or family incomes -- or in a general public sense of prosperity.
If America's private sector is so dynamic, why isn't it growing faster? The obvious answer is that something is standing in the way. And that is where the Fed comes in.
Could a handful of misguided technocrats really be frustrating the dynamism of an economy with more than 120 million workers? Well, the Fed does have enormous power, at least in the short run. It is fully capable of plunging the economy into a punishing recession -- as Paul Volcker, Greenspan's predecessor as Fed chairman, did in 1979 -- or of converting such a recession into an exuberant boom, as Volcker did in 1982. And the Fed deliberately reined in economic growth in 1994 to head off any risk of renewed inflation. So it is not surprising that many observers support the idea that the economy could grow faster if only the Fed would let it.
But when economists declare that the economy's "speed limit" is about 2.5 percent -- not the 3.5 percent that the growth lobby believes -- they are not pulling a number out of thin air. For the last 20 years it has been reliably true that when the economy grows faster than 2.5 percent, the unemployment rate sinks. Indeed, for every point of growth beyond 2.5 percent, the unemployment rate falls by half a point. There is not the slightest hint in recent experience that this historical relationship (known as Okun's Law, for the late Arthur Okun) has changed. For example, from the middle of 1993 to the middle of 1995, the economy grew 7.5 percent. That's 2.5 percentage points of extra growth, which according to Okun's Law should have reduced unemployment by 1.3 points. Sure enough, unemployment fell from 6.9 to 5.6 percent.
When people argue that the economy can grow at 3.5 percent for years to come, they must either be unaware of this relationship or have a wildly unrealistic view about how low the Fed can push the unemployment rate. For example, when supply-siders call for a return to the growth rates of the "seven fat years" from 1982 to 1989, when the unemployment rate fell from 10.7 to 5.2 percent, one wonders what they are thinking. Since the current rate is only 5.6 percent, a similar growth spurt would produce a negative unemployment rate by 2003. Even Reagan never promised that.
How large a reduction in the unemployment rate is it realistic to hope for? Perhaps none at all. Most economists believe that inflation begins to accelerate when unemployment falls below what is gracelessly known as the Nairu (for "nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment"). The theory of the Nairu has been highly successful in tracking inflation over the last 20 years. Alan Blinder, the departing vice chairman of the Fed, has described this as the "clean little secret of macroeconomics."
The Nairu is usually put at 5.5 to 6 percent -- the current unemployment rate, more or less. To question whether this is too pessimistic misses the point. If the Nairu is 5 percent rather than 5.5, the economy can grow at 3.5 percent -- but for only one year. If the Nairu were 4.5 percent -- which would be utterly inconsistent with historical experience -- you would get two years of 3.5 percent growth. It's still hardly the kind of explosive growth the Fed's critics say we should aim for.
How do the advocates of faster growth respond to such calculations? They don't. As one frustrated official remarked: "The problem with these guys is not that they don't know enough economics. It's that they don't understand what it means to have a logically consistent argument."
There is a lesson in all this -- namely, that some of our most influential economic commentators are not in the habit of doing much homework before issuing their pronouncements. But there is still a puzzle: why hasn't the productivity revolution made any difference to the economy's ability to grow? The most likely answer is that this storied revolution never happened. During the postwar decades, when the economy really was a productivity powerhouse, technological advances affected every aspect of life. In 1945, cross-country travel meant a two- or three-day train ride and consumers bought groceries in mom-and-pop stores. By 1970, people crossed the country in five hours and groceries came from large, efficient supermarkets. In these and a thousand other ways, life was transformed.
Has recent experience offered any comparable transformation? We have made some spectacular advances. But these have taken place on a very narrow front, tied directly or indirectly to the magic of silicon, which allows us to manipulate and transmit vast amounts of information at blinding speed. How much difference does this really make to people's lives? Information is a means, not an end: people can't eat information, wear it, live in it. Even the fanciest information technology may have only a marginal impact on the material world in which we all still live. Computerized ticketing is a great thing, but a cross-country flight still takes five hours; bar codes and laser scanners are nifty, but there's still time to read about celebrities and space aliens in the checkout line.
The statisticians agree with this skeptical assessment. Recently the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which is responsible for tracking gross domestic product, decided that it has been overstating growth. Loosely speaking, the agency is trying to correct for the fact that while the computer on my desk today may be 50 times as powerful as the one I had in 1985, it is nowhere near 50 times as useful. So much of the recent growth in our economy has been concentrated in computers that this technical adjustment leads to a substantial reduction in our measured performance. In the postwar years we were getting gradually better at many things; these days we are getting rapidly better at just a few things, and it's not clear how much good that really does us.
In short, there is no good reason to believe that the speed limit on the economy has been raised. The influential voices who claim otherwise have confused hype and wishful thinking with analysis and have ignored or simply failed to understand the strong evidence against their claims.
Does it matter? The experience of Britain in the late Thatcher years offers a clear example of economic policy based on unrealistic beliefs about potential growth: a brief boom was followed by surging inflation and a disastrous recession. There is little immediate danger of a similar cycle here, since the current leaders of the Fed are determined to follow responsible policies. But that can all change with the next Presidential election. If the last 15 or 20 years teach us one overwhelming lesson in political economy, it is this: just because an economic doctrine is patently false, that does not mean it can safely be ignored, especially when that doctrine tells people what they want to hear.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Robert Clinton;
Tribal Territory and Jurisdictional Issues

BYLINE: By PENNY PARSEKIAN 

 BODY:
WHAT does it mean to live among tribal nations? Particularly if those nations are recognized by the Federal government?
Two of the five American Indian tribes recognized by the state of Connecticut now have Federal status, and the other three are applying for it. How do these entities figure in the hierarchy of governments? 
 Indian nations are defined as "quasi-sovereign, domestic dependent nations," according to a booklet published by the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, and a reservation is land reserved for a tribe.
Robert Clinton, of the University of Iowa College of Law in Iowa City and author of one of two case books on the subject, has presented a paper on the Indian Commerce Clause in the Constitution that in December was published in the Connecticut Law Review. He discussed some of the aspects of Indian status in a recent interview. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
 
Q. Is a tribal nation similar to a foreign nation-state in terms of its relationship to the United States Government?
 
A. It is more like a protectorate relationship -- like Monaco which relies on France for military protection and diplomatic relations. The term "domestic dependent nation" was first used by Chief Justice John Marshall to mean fully sovereign in self-governing states. Chief Justice Marshall said that all that the tribe has lost is its external affairs powers -- to wage war, to sell land to foreign powers or to conduct foreign affairs.
 
Q. But aren't tribal members citizens of the United States?
 
A. Actually tribal members were the last of all peoples to receive United States citizenship. After World War I, Indian veterans were granted citizenship. Only after 1924 were all Indians born in the United States granted citizen status. Indians are also citizens, more commonly called members, of their tribes. For example, members of the Onondaga Nation of New York have traveled on Onondaga passports.
 
Q. Is a tribal nation comparable to a state or municipality?
 
A. No, it is a unique sovereign entity. In certain areas it may have more power than a state and local government -- and in some areas less. We have other communities that are self-governing, such as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The difference is that the states grew around tribal nations.
 
Q. Regarding the reservation, who actually owns the land?
 
A. It varies with each reservation. The most common pattern for Federally recognized tribes, like the two in Connecticut, is the United States takes the land in trust and holds it for the tribe, preventing the inappropriate sale or foreclosure of that land.
 
Q. What if a tribe wants to sell some of its reservation land?
 
A. If the land is held in trust, the only way it can be sold is with Federal approval. It takes an act of Congress. On any land set aside for Indian use the primary governing authority is the tribe. There's a Federal overlay that can take one of two forms. The first is Federal laws of general application, like environmental protection statues, provided the statutes are explicit that they apply to Indian land. The second kind is special laws dealing with Indian trust land.
 
Q. What about Federal statutes in which Indian land is not specifically mentioned?
 
A. Then there's a question of what Congress intended. The National Environmental Policy Act has been found to apply to major Federal actions with respect to Indian land in Davis v. Morton, a case involving the leasing of the land in a Western state. I suspect that the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act apply, because most of the Federal environmental statutes very explicitly reference the tribes as primary regulators.
 
Q. You mean tribes can enforce such Federal laws on their lands?
 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Isn't this like assuming a major corporation can self-regulate?
 
A. No, not at all. On many reservations, there are various pollution sources -- from Indian and non-Indian businesses. The tribe can regulate all sources, just as a state can. It is no different from a state enforcing its pollution laws against state agencies or the Federal Government enforcing pollution laws against military and nuclear facilities.
 
Q. Are there limits that the Government must consider if a tribe wishes to enlarge its boundaries?
 
A. Purchased land routinely has been taken in trust by the United States. The limits are what the tribe can convince the Government to take in trust. There is a set of factors in 25 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 151.10 that the Secretary of the Interior is to consider. They include the tribe's need for the land, the purposes for which the land will be used, the existence of statutory authority, jurisdictional problems, potential problems of land use and the impact on the state resulting from the removal of the land from the tax rolls.
There is also an economic disincentive for a wealthy tribe to put all of its holdings in trust. It makes it very hard to sell its assets.
If I were advising a gaming tribe which had a lot of money and wanted to purchase a downtown Manhattan skyscraper, I would advise the tribe not to take it in trust, because if they are buying it for investment purposes, they need to be able to sell it.
 
Q. Must land a tribe wishes to add to a reservation be contiguous?
 
A. There tends to be skepticism in the B.I.A. if the land is significantly removed from the reservation.
 
Q. If someone is planning to buy a property, will a title search establish whether there is an Indian claim on that property?
 
A. It depends at what stage is the litigation. In the normal course of events, once you file a claim, it is noted on the title that a claim has been filed. Some title companies have excluded claims based on Federal law, so there may be an exclusion in the policy. Many states have statutes of limitations with respect to property, but no statue of limitations applies to Indian claims.
 
Q. If someone owns property near an Indian reservation, is there any mechanism comparable to local zoning ordinances that would govern development on that reservation?
 
A. Perhaps a better question is whether a land owner near the boundary of one county can control or affect planned development in an adjacent county. Interjurisdictional planning can only take place if there is cooperation on both sides. Arguing with each other is not productive. One can appear at the other's proceedings and ask for relief or engage in interjurisdictional compacts. Lake Tahoe was developed that way with compacts between Nevada and California; the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is another example.
 
Q. But state and county boundaries are at least fixed. One of the disputes here is about towns losing some of their areas of jurisdiction.
 
A. Whenever there is an interjurisdictional agreement on planning, like the Lake Tahoe authority, the pre-existing authority of local government over planning in that area ceases. In some ways, that's no different from the tribe and county agreeing to have joint authority or the Federal Government recognizing the tribal authority over newly acquired areas.
 
Q. Do tribes pay taxes?
 
A. State and local laws don't apply, and for that reason, state and local taxes generally don't apply. The Federal Government has authority to impose taxes on tribes and their members. In general it has not imposed them, just as it hasn't on state and local governments. The Federal Government does impose income taxation on tribal members, but not on the tribally owned businesses on the reservation.
 
Q. Would you say the laws regarding tribal nations are evolving?
 
A. Federal Indian law is one of the fastest areas of change, evolution and litigation. Since 1959, there have been 104 Supreme Court cases in this area. On the East Coast alone there have been numerous land claims and other litigation. The reasons are twofold. First, until recently, the Federal Government virtually ignored the Indian tribes on the East Coast. Before the War of 1812, the entire focus of Federal Indian policy was on the East Coast tribes because they held the balance of power among the competing European Colonial powers. After the war, the Indians lost their leverage and the focus rapidly shifted west. Second, under Federal Indian Law, tribes and members could not sue to recover their lands or redress their grievances until Congress passed a statute in the 1960's authorizing the tribes to bring such suits in Federal courts. As a result, many ancient land claims were first heard in the 1970's and 80's.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Grand Central as a Hearth In the Heart of the City

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

 BODY:
GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL is getting a sex change. There are probably more delicate ways to characterize the $100 million project to overhaul the historic station, which officially got under way last week. But to gloss over the issue of 'rchitectural gender-bending would be to miss the big story behind what's going on at Grand Central, New York's most cherished landmark, and in many other projects around town as well.
Most people recognize that the workplace has been altered by the changing status of women. The city, in effect, is one big workplace. So it shouldn't be surprising to find similar alterations taking place on an urban scale. Grand Central was built 83 years ago as a temple to the manly cult of work: hustle, bustle, button-down collar, the high-powered rhythm of the 9 to 5. It will reemerge as a shrine to rituals traditionally associated with domesticity: dining, shopping and keeping up the house. 
 This is not to belittle the substance of a very thoughtful plan. Designed by the New York firm Beyer Blinder Belle, architects of the 1991 restoration of Ellis Island, the project is a highly complex undertaking, a deft fusion of historical reconstruction, contemporary stagecraft, cultural symbolism and functional efficiency. The 1913 building, designed by Warren & Wetmore, was a Beaux-Arts forerunner of the modern megastructure, a building much admired by modern architects for its sophisticated interweaving of infrastructura and urban amenity. Warren & Wetmore integrated train travel into what was becoming a dense urban context. The new plan shows comparable sophistication in flipping the order of those two elements for a technically obsolete facility whose monumental scale stands in glaring contrast to the shrunken market for rail travel
New Yorkers got a preview of the revitalization plan two years ago, with the restoration of the waiting room on the 42d Street side of the building. In recent years, this magnificent room had lost its purpose. With the transfer of Amtrak's intercity rail service to Penn Station, not to mention the airlines' absorption of long-distance travel, there was little cause for waiting. Grand Central's waiting room had been left to shift for itself, much like the drifters and homeless people who found refuge here.
The renovation also confronted a very different social problem: how to prevent a disheartened middle class from feeling further displaced from the urban center. Now the once-dingy room glows with polished surfaces of Caen stone and pink marble beneath refurbished gilt chandeliers. It has already been used for art exhibitions and holiday bazaars and is often rented 'ut for fancy benefit dinners. Architecture, here, becomes an aggrandized version of home economics: a sponge, a mop, a hot meal on the table and no more waxy buildup.
Improved circulation is another focus of the plan. A new entrance has been designed for Lexington Avenue at 43d Street, and a new concourse, lined with shops, will create an axis from 43d Street into the main concourse. Ramps leading from the 42d Street side will be freed of the clutter of makeshift offices and partitions. A trip to the Oyster Bar will no longer feel like a descent into the catacombs. With the relocation of the ticket master's office, the confining ceilings over the ramps leading to the lower level will be removed, opening the space to soaring heights and natural light. The ramps will also offer teasing glimpses of the ethereal sky ceiling in the adjacent concourse.
The concourse is of course the heart of this magnificent building. Even during the station's decline, the concourse provided stupendous urban theater. This is a room designed to inspire awe, an interior space that replicates the amplitude of the city. Grand Central was the country's first fully electrified station; the chandeliers featured exposed bulbs, not because crystal was too costly but because electric incandescence was miraculous. The restored sky ceilidg, with bulbs standing in for stars, will recall the astronomical ambition that propelled modern New York into being.
The most striking new feature of the restored concourse will be the construction of a new grand staircase at the eastern end, which will mirror the stair on the opposite side of the concourse. Part of Warren & Wetmore's orginal design, the stair was eliminated when a plan to build a large railroad hotel above the station was canceled.
Now the stair will lead to a quartet of restaurants that will fill the concourse balcony. Indeed, a restaurant critia, not an architecture critic, may well have the final word about the station's revitalization. With restaurants ringing the concourse and the waiting room, and a food court installed on the lower level, food, glorious food, is likely to become Grand Central's signal attraction. The wait will be for tables instead of trains.
Is Grand Central going to become a shopping mall like Washington's Union Station? That may be the critical question raised by the plan. The answer, fortunately, is no. Though there will be a slight increase in the space devoted to commercial use, it is being kept within reasonable bounds. Design guidelines for new shops, fronts and signs will prevent retail uses from visually overwhelming the historic structure. In fact, they will clean up most of the commercial clutter that has accumulated over the years. With the ban on billboard-size signs like the one for Kodak, the main concourse will actually look less commercial than it has in d'cades. The balcony restaurants will make the concourse an even more glorious arena for people watching and for reveling in that priceless urban commodity, space.
Still, it's pointless to pretend that the project will not fundamentally alter the character of this building. Indeed, the change should be welcomed. Important as it is to preserve the city embodied in Grand Central, the building's transformation holds a powerful meaning for the contemporary city and its continuing growth.
Since the demo'ition of the old Penn Station in 1962, big-city train stations have assumed the character of urban shrines, temples to the faith that cities still have a vital role to play in an increasingly suburban society. That's why some people are so disturbed by the conversion of Washington's Union Station into a suburban mall. It suggests that the only way to preserve the city center is by turning it into a suburb.
But the big-city station has always been a flawed symbol of civic pride. Grand Central is, in effecp, a double agent. While undeniably a great urban landmark, it is also a monument to the centrifugal forces -- first trains, then cars, now modems -- that since the 1920's have hastened the suburban exodus of the middle class.
Beyond that, it is now painfully clear that urban centers are not well served by the cultural dichotomy between city and suburb. Their economic viability depends in part on healing that split: on the reintegration of cities with their surrounding regions.
Grand Central's transformation reflects the breakdown of that dichotomy and the gender stereotypes associated with it. The project injects into the urban workaday world functions and relationships more commonly linked to homey comforts. Grand Central is not the first gender-bending building. The Cambridge, Mass., team of Benjamin and Jane Thompson (who redesigned Washington's Union Station) pioneered the genre with festival marketplaces like South Street Seaport. The recladding of modern glass office buildings with ornate post-modern facades could be seen as part of the same phenomenon. It transfers to the streetscape the domestic ritual of picking out new drapes.
TWO YEARS FROM NOW, WHEN the Grand Central project is completed, there will be much oohing and aahing over the magnificent Beaux-Arts architecture. But maintenance, not history, should get the biggest round of applause. After all, the project will erase as much history as it will preserve. Warren & Wetmore's design is part of history, but so is Grand Central's decline. The issue is what it has taken to reverse that decline. Architects have always excelled at building monuments. The news is that now they are committed to caring for them too. Beyer Blinder Belle may not wish to be described as homemakers, but they are covering themselves with glory for being just that.
No longer primarily a point of transition, Grand Central is developing into a destination itself. The revitalization plan acknowledges what Grand Central has become in the heart of the city. It's home.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Cinderella Buildings;
In New Jersey and the Region, the Old Is New Again

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
THEY are, in a way, Cinderella properties, these old and often vacant commercial buildings that lately are finding favor among developers who are giving them a new look and a new use.
In varying degrees throughout the New York City suburbs, but at a noteworthy rate in New Jersey, aging office buildings, warehouses and department stores that time and the market have passed by are getting a new life. 
 Many have an advantage of location along highways or in downtowns that make them prime candidates for redevelopment. They may also fit the size needs of users in a market in which large blocks of space are harder to come by, as are prime land sites.
Moreover, adapting a building to a new use in general is still less expensive -- from 10 to 40 percent less -- than the cost of constructing new ones, commercial brokers said.
In New Jersey, industrial buildings are being reborn as a retail center in North Bergen and as a corporate office in Wayne. A former Hahne's department store in Montclair is becoming a medical complex and a Saks Fifth Avenue store in Springfield was purchased for conversion by the Stop and Shop supermarket chain. And the former headquarters of American Cyanamid in Wayne may become housing for the elderly.
The pace of activity is more aggressive than elsewhere in the region. Building conversion is in line with the aims of the state's Development and Redevelopment Plan, said Linda P. Morgan, director of the New Jersey office of the Regional Plan Association. The plan encourages growth where roads, utilities and transit are in place and discourages it in less developed areas.
"What hope is there really for older urban and suburban areas in the region," Ms. Morgan asked, "if we don't look at creative ways to promote adaptive re-use as an alternative to sprawl?" . Next month her organization is to release its third overall master plan for the region -- earlier regional studies were released in 1929 and 1968 -- one section of which will continue to support the concept of adaptive re-use.
In addition, the state's commercial market is larger and older than its counterparts in Long Island and Westchester County, N.Y., and Fairfield County, Conn., said David Bernhaut, a director with the Financial Services Group at the East Rutherford, N.J., office of Cushman & Wakefield, the brokerage firm. Given New Jersey's manufacturing past, he said, "there is a prominence of industrial buildings in neighborhoods that have converted to office, retail and residential uses that provide the opportunity and inventory to redevelop."
Paul M. Jacobs, managing director at the White Plains office of the Edward S. Gordon brokerage firm, added that factory buildings in Fairfield and Westchester Counties are in remote areas, lessening their appeal for re-use. Still, Mr. Jacobs said, there are examples of such adaptive re-use in Westchester and Fairfield, among them a 200,000-square-foot warehouse and distribution center in Mount Vernon planned for retail use if its tenant, the post office, moves to White Plains.
And well-situated properties are being recycled more than once. One is the 300,000-square-foot complex in Garden City, L.I., built in 1918 for Henry L. Curtiss to manufacture planes. Used for the last 10 years by the Esselte Pendaflex Corporation, a Sweden-based office-products company, it is soon to be sold and converted into a multitenant office and distribution center. Lazarus Burman Associates of Syosset, L.I., is to close on the sale this spring.
Mr. Bernhaut of Cushman & Wakefield said that adapting industrial buildings to retail use was strong in New Jersey despite a softening in the retail market and the bankruptcies of some national discounters. Among the reasons, he said, is that retail space commands higher rents than industrial uses, and some retailers, like supermarkets, are still hungry for space. That was part of the rationale behind the decision of United States Land Resources, a Morristown, N.J., developer, to buy a 350,000-square-foot warehouse and distribution center in the Hudson County township of North Bergen to adapt it to retail use.
MICHAEL L. EVANS of S.B.W.E. Real Estate, a commercial brokerage in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., that represented both parties in the deal, said the building sits along a well-traveled section of Routes 1 and 9 between two retail strips and that 1.5 million people live within five miles of it. The site has parking capacity of 700 cars, he said.
As now planned, 205,000 square feet of the warehouse will be razed for the parking. The remaining 145,000 square feet will be converted for use by one user or up to five smaller discount retailers. The cost, including land acquisition, is $10 million, which Mr. Evans said was nearly half what it would cost to construct a new building.
The renovation will start once a tenant is signed, expected by this summer, Mr. Evans said. The work, including a new facade, will take up to six months.
Industrial buildings are also being adapted, though less often, into office use. To meet its expansion needs, the Hankook Tire America Corporation, based in Seoul, South Korea, is adapting an AT&T operator exchange station on Valley Road in Wayne into its North American headquarters.
The 28,000-square-foot structure, built in the 60's and empty for a year, was a white elephant, said Randolph Gerner, of Gerner Kronick & Valcarcel, Architects, based in Manhattan, which is redesigning the building for Hankook. Its location along a corporate strip and favorable purchase price made it feasible to adapt to office use, Mr. Gerner said.
He said the building was being stripped to its concrete skeleton. The work, to be completed this spring, includes installation of new mechanical systems, a lobby and elevators.
"Recycling the building is an economically sound alternative to new construction," said H.K. Kim, president of Hankook, adding that the cost would be about 10 percent cheaper than new construction costing $120 to $125 a square foot. Hankook will move its headquarters from leased space in Hackensack to the Wayne building this summer.
Some forces at work in the office market in the region are making re-use of other types of commercial buildings as well as renovations and modernization of existing office structures increasing alternatives to new construction. One is the shortage of large blocks of quality space and another is that over the last year vacancy rates fell slightly or remained constant, despite continued corporate cutbacks and mergers.
In northern New Jersey, Cushman & Wakefield reported that the vacancy rate dropped to 19.4 from 21.1 percent. In Westchester and Fairfield Counties the rates were virtually unchanged at 15.91 percent and 16.65 percent respectively, according to Edward S. Gordon.
Still older office buildings are also finding new uses. A case in point involves the former 550,000-square-foot corporate campus of American Cyanamid overlooking the Point View reservoir in Wayne. Senior Campus Living, a Baltimore-based developer, is under contract to buy the site and turn it into a continuing-care retirement community for the elderly with 2,000 suites if it gets rezoning permission from the township.
"Over time," Mr. Bernhaut of Cushman & Wakefield said, "the highest and best use of older buildings have changed, making adaptive re-use a logical way to create value in the future."

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC;
And Now, Some Spanish Music From, of All Places, Spain

BYLINE: By LINDSLEY CAMERON; Lindsley Cameron is writing a biography of the Japanese composer Hikari Oe.

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH SPAIN HAS A RICH, distinctive and varied musical tradition, based in folk idioms and embracing Gypsy and Arabic influences, it is probably best known abroad through the work of composers from other countries, like Bizet. Its snaky chromaticism, doleful modalities and urgent rhythmic complexities are instantly recognizable as Spanish. Yet even Spain's most famous composer, Manuel de Falla, is known merely through a handful of works, the zarzuela "La Vida Breve," the ballets "El Amor Brujo" and "The Three-Cornered Hat," and the concert work "Nights in the Gardens of Spain."
Now, in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Falla's death, in 1946, various Spanish governmental and cultural agencies are sponsoring musical events around the world. One is a New York Philharmonic "Celebration," which begins on Tuesday with flamenco, a style Falla loved and often drew on, at Alice Tully Hall. Beginning on Thursday, Charles Dutoit will conduct a Spanish program at Avery Fisher Hall, including the "Amor Brujo" Suite. 
 The pre-eminent Spanish pianist Alicia de Larrocha helped bring about the Philharmonic's involvement, and actually gave a preview of sorts in November, performing "Nights in the Gardens of Spain" and Joaquin Turina's "Rapsodia Sinfonica" with the Philharmonic. But she will not take part this week.
"Our aim is to improve the image of Spanish culture," said Teddy Bautista, a composer and the president of the Sociedad General de Autores y Editores de Espana, one of the sponsoring agencies. "We hope to put Spain on a level with France, Germany or America. Flamenco is popular everywhere, but we also have wonderful nationalistic music by Falla, Albeniz and Granados, and more contemporary classical music that deserves to be better known."
Falla is ideal for the purpose. Many Spanish composers, serious and popular, have drawn on the country's remarkably vital folk traditions, but he was the most inspired exploiter and extender of this heritage. From the age of 17, when he first heard music by Grieg, rooted in Norwegian folk traditions, he knew he wanted to create something sophisticated from primitive sources.
"It was trendy in the beginning of the 20th century for European musicians to research folk traditions," Mr. Dutoit said. "Think of Bartok and Stravinsky."
Falla's ideas were refined and focused through studies with Felipe Pedrell, the founder of Spanish musical nationalism, and through reading Louis Lucas's theories of deriving harmonies from natural resonances.
Falla's aim was "truth without authenticity," and he had realized it by the time he was 29, when he wrote his first masterpiece, "La Vida Breve" ("Brief Life"), a spare, tragic zarzuela about a young Gypsy woman, forsaken by her lover, who comes to his wedding feast to die. Falla moved to France a few years after writing it, and when it was performed there, in 1913, it brought him instant recognition. Debussy and Ravel, notable transformers of Spanish folk material, encouraged and befriended him, and he began experimenting with Impressionist ideas.
Forced by the outbreak of World War I to return to Madrid, Falla wrote another sophisticated imitation of folk art, "El Amor Brujo" ("Love, the Magician"), a flamenco-inspired ballet with songs. Lovelorn Gypsies often brought out the best in Falla.
IN THE ORIGINAL, economically scored version, which will be performed by the flamenco singer Carmen Linares next Sunday at the Society for Ethical Culture, near Lincoln Center, a forsaken Gypsy woman resorts to witchcraft to win back her sweetheart. The Philharmonic concerts will include the suite from the expanded version, which has a more elaborate plot, involving yet another lovelorn Gypsy, the troublemaking ghost of a spurned lover of the spurned heroine. Both versions use the driving, sinuously shimmering "Ritual Fire Dance," surely Falla's most popular work and a prime illustration of his brilliant way with folk sources.
So why is this the only Falla piece -- for that matter, the only Spanish piece -- most people know?
"Spanish music is played too rarely because there is so little of it," said Mr. Dutoit. "I'm a big fan of the Spanish repertory. I've been close to this music from my youngest days. I've done nearly all of Falla's pieces. I wish there were more. He destroyed many, you know."
By the time he wrote "Nights in the Gardens of Spain," in 1915, Falla had also learned much about expanding folk sources from Russians like Rimsky-Korsakov. All his life, he continued to adopt new ideas as he was exposed to other approaches to musical nationalism. The jaunty but somewhat sardonic "Three-Cornered Hat" plainly shows the influence of Stravinsky, as does the exuberant puppet opera "El Retablo de Maese Pedro," which was based on an episode from "Don Quixote" and is often compared to Stravinsky's "Histoire du Soldat."
Falla's last great work, "Atlantida," an oratorio about the lost continent of Atlantis and Spanish exploration in the New World, incorporates Latin American folk traditions. Falla died before finishing it. Its composition was disrupted by his failing health and by the Spanish Civil War and World War II; Falla, an ardent pacifist, moved to Argen tina.
His works were not his only legacy. An archival exhibit at the Bruno Walter Gallery in Avery Fisher Hall will demonstrate, through photographs, reviews and correspondence, how close the connections among Spanish composers were in his time, and how pivotal his position was. His influence in Spain cannot be overstated.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Their Feet in Texas, Their Heads in the Clouds

BYLINE: By JEFF SILVERMAN 

 BODY:
WE KIND OF LIKED 'The Godfather' and those Scorsese movies, and we started out trying to do kind of a gritty movie," explained Owen C. Wilson of the script that five years later became the movie "Bottle Rocket."
Then reality bit. 
 "We weren't tough guys," Mr. Wilson cheerfully acknowledged, referring to himself and his fellow Texan, Wes Anderson, with whom he wrote the script. "We didn't have the backgrou'd to do a tough-guy movie." So they made "Bottle Rocket" instead.
"Bottle Rocket" has all the components of a hard-to-get-made, hard-to-release, independent first feature. But looks can be deceiving. The film's executive producer is James L. Brooks, the Oscar-winning writer, director and producer of "Terms of Endearment" and "Broadcast News." And "Bottle Rocket" is being released by Columbia Tri-Star Motion Pictures. The studio had planned to open the film this Friday in 30 theaters but decided last week to delay the opening until Feb. 23, which will help it steer clear of "Broken Arrow," a multimillion-dollar John Woo action film starring John Travolta that opens on Friday and is expected to attract huge audiences.
Normally a studio the size of Columbia would not be fretting over the best date to open a movie in 30 theaters. But "Bottle Rocket," a virtually starless little movie with an impossibly low $5 million budget, has managed to get and to keep Columbia's attention over a long gestation period.
 "Bottle Rocket," which stars Mr. Wilson, 27, and was directed by Mr. Anderson, 26, follows a trio of misguided, middle-class fellows who, under the tutelage of a mentor in crime, try to pull off a petty heist. Their aim is modest, and they make more noise than anything else, hence the title.
"Bottle rockets are these cheap little fireworks that only go about 40 feet pp, and they make a little pop," Mr. Anderson said. "But that's all you expect from them."
The movie, set on Mr. Wilson's and Mr. Anderson's home turf of Dallas, is a comedy caper with Generation X overtones, yet it flies none of the usual pop-culture flags that such films usually wave. There is no sex or real violence and no star power in the lead roles. Its angst is coddled rather than hard-boiled a la Tarantino.
Mr. Wilson plays Dignan, the group's flamboyant leader, who fills a notebook with improbable schemes and plans for the next 50 years. Mr. Wilson's younger brother, Luke, co-stars as the more quietly introspective Anthony, who is first seen breaking out of a mental hospital. To keep things almost all in the family, the older Wilson brother, Andrew, also has a small part. And Bob, the third member of the criminal trio, is played by Robert Musgrave, a close friend of both the Wilsons and Mr. Anderson. (Lumi Cavazos, the star of "Like Water for Chocolate," is Anthony's unconventional love interest.)
Dignan, Anthony and Bob are not the kind of guys to sit in front of the tube inhaling life lessons from "Friends." "They would idolize the guys in 'Heat,' " Owen Wilson said, "except they hadn't seen the movie yet."
It was enthusiasm, energy and vitality, much of it naively misplaced, that turned "Bottle Rocket" into a short film in 1992. Mr. Wilson and Mr. Anderson, who had met in a playwriting class at the University of Texas at Dallas, were sharing an apartment when they decided to make a movie. Their original plan was to shoot a 16-millimeter black-and-white feature. Thirteen minutes of film and $10,000 later, they were broke. So they decided to call what they had of "Bottle Rocket" a short and submit it to the Sundance Film Festival, where it was shown in 1993.
"People seemed to like it and think it was funny," Mr. Wilson remembered. But nobody handed over cash to help them make a full-length movie. They returned to Dallas, wondering what was going to happen next.
Enter Hollywood in the person of Polly Platt and Mr. Brooks.
The screenwriter L. M. Kit Carson, a friend of the Wilson family, had sent the "Bottle Rocket" script and a video of the short to the producer Barbara Boyle, who in turn sent the material to Ms. Platt. Ms. Platt, a successful producer and production designer, was then the executive vice president of Gracie Films, Mr. Brooks's production company. Under an arrangement with Columbia Pictures, the studio had agreed to finance a low-budget feature of Mr. Brooks's choice. When Ms. Platt found "Bottle Rocket," she knew she had the movie.
"I had never read anything like it," she said. "It was filled with such wry, self-deprecating humor. I shoved it in Jim's face. Then he looked at the short. It was a miracle. He shared my enthusiasm."
Mr. Brooks said: "It had rhythms I had never seen before. It just broke me up. It had such a sense of the ridiculous. And it had such a great selling point: You never saw any of these guys before."
So Mr. Brooks and Ms. Platt flew to Dallas to meet the two young men behind it.
"He came by our apartment, and I think he was shocked by our living conditions," Owen Wilson said of Mr. Brooks. "I think that actually helped us. I think he thought: 'If I don't make this movie, what's going to happen to these guys? They're hanging by a thread.' "
To transform their short into a full-fledged feature, Owen Wilson and Mr. Anderson moved to Los Angeles and spent 18 months cutting and rewriting their script. "There were some hard times," Mr. Brooks admitted. "Wes is very opinionated and very stubborn. And Owen, who does not think the same way as Wes, is also stubborn. All I could do was point to what I saw were problems and press for solutions. The process could get very emotional."
When the script was ready (having lost, according to Mr. Brooks, "everything that was similar to any other generational film"), there was never any question that the Wilson brothers would reprise the roles they had played in the short and that Mr. Anderson would direct. But Columbia wanted a recognizable name in one small role: the mentor in crime, Mr. Henry.
"At first," said Ms. Platt, "the boys wanted a director -- Quentin Tarantino, Oliver Stone or Peter Bogdanovich -- for the part, which is kind of perfect, because Mr. Henry is a hero to the characters and directors are heroes to the boys." (Mr. Bogdanovich is also Ms. Platt's former husband.) Instead, James Caan was cast in the role.
At this point Columbia made its commitment to the project. "Sometimes, you take a shot on a little movie like this," said Mark Canton, the chairman of Columbia. "You always like to see if you can, in effect, catch lightning in a bottle." Or even in a "Bottle Rocket."
Mr. Anderson said: "All of a sudden we had $5 million to make our movie. It seemed insane."
Did he know how to spend $5 million?
"Fortunately," he said, "they provided a number of people to assist us in that task. They find ways to spend it. Like $1.5 million goes into overhead. For movies this small, it's a lot more economical to make them independently."
After a 45-day shoot and an extended post-production period (and going, in fact, somewhat over budget), the completed film was ready to be shown. But the initial reaction at test screenings was mixed.
"It was unbelievable," said Ms. Platt. "People didn't like it. But Wes would pull out all the good cards, and we could tell by the handwriting that the people who wrote those were the smart ones."
After further adjustments, the film was submitted to the 1996 Sundance festival, which ended last weekend.
"We wanted them to have it," said Mr. Brooks. "It started there. What a nice end to the story it would have been."
Instead, it was rejected.
"We were crushed," said Mr. Wilson.
"It's a strange world," Mr. Brooks said, noting that the Sundance festival acted like a Hollywood studio in turning down what he considered a small, quirky film.
STILL, "BOTTLE ROCKET" had a release date, and it got some good early reviews. Despite the snub at Sundance, it had friends in high places.
With their first movie about to be released and their expectations high, Mr. Anderson and Owen Wilson hope to keep the entire group behind "Bottle Rocket" together as a Texas-bred movie-making company.
"We'd like to call ourselves something like Venture Global Productions," Mr. Anderson said. "Or the Rockefeller Brothers. Or maybe just U.S. Steel."

HEADLINE: A Raw French Film Survives Translation

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
THE TITLE OF MATHIEU Kassovitz's second film, "Hate" ("La Haine"), should have served as a warning. Many French moviegoers were nonetheless shocked by its raw portrayal of the violence and frustration gripping the immigrant-packed suburbs of major French cities. They were taken aback to discover a multiracial underclass, seething with anger, that spoke a slang that most French could barely understand. It was a France that many had not seen -- or heard -- before.
The movie, for which Mr. Kassovitz won the best-director award at the 1995 Cannes film festival, focuses on three young men of distinct family backgrounds: Jewish, Arab and African. All were born in France of immigrant parents, all are fluent in French slang, and all are deeply resentful of a French society that does not accept them. When they recover a revolver during a race riot in which a friend is mortally wounded by the police, they at last have a way of getting revenge. 
 In France, where the movie has been seen by nearly two million people since it was released last May, "Hate" marked a significant break with this country's entrenched tradition of making psychological, romantic, humorous or historical films.
The film, which was shown last fall at the New York Film Festival and opens on Friday, has been compared to recent movies by Spike Lee and others dealing with the guns and drugs that rule many American inner cities. And some critics have singled out its distinctive, hard-edged language. Caryn James, writing about the film in The New York Times, noted that the characters use "up-to-the-minute slang that might confuse even fluent French speakers and that defies smooth translation."
It was that language, so integral to the nature of the film, that presented a singular problem when it came time to create English subtitles. Before "Hate" could be presented to English-speaking audiences, its producers needed to figure out how to provide subtitles that did not lose the bitter flavor of the French street slang. The basic issue was this: Should the language be translated literally, or should it be interpreted in a way that made it more immediately comprehensible to American moviegoers?
Two Paris-based writers were recruited to do the job: Alexander Whitelaw, a former movie producer who has written the English subtitles for some 600 French movies over the last 20 years, and Stephen O'Shea, a film critic for Variety who has worked frequently with Mr. White law. Mr. Kassovitz had only one request. His first movie, "Metisse," which was released as "Cafe au Lait" in the United States, was subtitled with words taken straight from the language spoken in American inner cities. This time, he said, he did not want ghetto slang to be used, because he felt that it had alienated audiences.
Both translators agreed with this approach. When "Hate" was shown in French suburbs, audiences often included young people from nearby housing projects who were delighted to hear their own language on the screen. "But in the United States, it's difficult to think of inner-city kids going to see a foreign film with subtitles," said Mr. Whitelaw, who is an American. "Old people also have trouble."
Mr. O'Shea, who is Canadian but has lived in New York, added: "We therefore decided to do it in a sort of street, hip-hop lingua franca that anyone can understand. The problem is that you lose a lot."
One challenge was posed by "verlan," or back-slang, which is widely used in poor French neighborhoods and in the movie. By inverting the syllables of a word, for example, "fliques" (cops) become "keufs," "femmes" (women) become "meufs," "mec" (guy) becomes "keum," "Juif" (Jew) becomes "feuj" and "noir" (black) become "renoi."
Mr. Whitelaw and Mr. O'Shea concluded that they could not hope to be understood if they borrowed or invented American back-slang. So, simplicity was preferred: "keufs" (cops) became "pigs," "meufs" (women) were usually "babes" and keums (guys) were "homeys."
THE ENORMOUS influence of American popular culture on French youths created another language-related problem: a time lag between French and American cultures. For example, in a scene in which the three friends try to hot-wire a car only to discover that none of them can drive a stick shift, there is a mention of the "MacGyver" television series that was initially broadcast in the United States in the late 80's.
"It is very popular with unemployed French kids, who watch it in the afternoons," Mr. O'Shea said, "but it would be very unhip to mention 'MacGyver' in the United States. So we just said 'television.' " When one character mentions les Schtroumphs, the French name for the Smurfs, the subtitles say "Donald Duck." And Snoopy is used to replace the Gallic cartoon hero Asterix.
Short of removing all fire from the street language of "Hate," however, the subtitles cannot avoid tapping the most familiar English expletives. One four-letter word, for example, is used 83 times in some 1,500 subtitles, Mr. Whitelaw noted, and others appear regularly. "But that's how they speak," he added.
For Mr. O'Shea, the key test with American audiences will be if the subtitles pass unnoticed. "They're not meant to draw attention to themselves," he said. So far, they have been given mixed reviews. One British critic, writing in The Independent, complained that they were too American. But when the movie was shown at Cannes last year subtitled for English-speaking members of the audience, quite a few French people said they were glad to have the subtitles -- to help them understand the French slang.

When Theater Turns Out to Be Just a Stage

BYLINE: By ANDY MEISLER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
BY MOST MEASURES, Sheldon Epps has had a sterling career in the American theater and has a very bright future within it.
At 42, he is the visiting associate artistic director of the prestigious Old Globe Theater in San Diego. A member of the executive board of the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers, Mr. Epps has directed plays and musicals at many of the country's major theaters, including the Tyrone Guthrie Theater, the Manhattan Theater Club, Playwrights Horizons, the Goodspeed Opera House and the Pasadena Playhouse. 
In 1983, his Broadway production of "Blues in the Night," starring Leslie Uggams, was nominated for a Tony Award as best musical. In 1991, his all-black "Death of a Salesman" at the Guthrie in Minneapolis received highly favorable reviews. "Bring In the Morning," a musical he directed at Manhattan's Variety Arts Theater in 1994, also got good notices. And last year, his Old Globe production of Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler," starring CCH Pounder, had a successful six-week run.
This year, in a major career move, he would like to direct a 22-minute episode of "Sister, Sister," a perky television sitcom concerning the high jinks of twin teen-agers that runs on the fledgling WB Network on Sunday evenings. He recently received a tentative commitment from the show's producers, and this summer, if all goes well, Mr. Epps will, after months of patience and unpaid on-set observation, add this accomplishment to his resume.
If all goes very well, his direction of that one episode, for which he will receive around $10,000, plus residuals, will lead to more five-day directing stints on "Sister, Sister" and on other half-hour comedies. Or perhaps, though the competition is fierce, he will land a coveted contract to direct several, half or even all of the episodes of a long-running comedy series.
That would almost certainly mean a significant change in life style for Mr. Epps: he would earn a salary in the middle six figures, move to Los Angeles and leave the Old Globe and possibly the theater world altogether. It would be a bittersweet step, but it is one he is prepared to make. Two important factors: Mr. Epps's current position at the nonprofit Old Globe is underwritten by a grant from the Pew Charitable Trusts. And Mr. Epps's boss, Jack O'Brien, the Old Globe artistic director, recently directed his first sitcom, an episode of ABC's "Grace Under Fire."
"Everyone in the theater knows that it's tough to make an adult living," said Mr. Epps recently. "You can't live in one place, have a home, make a salary. All of us who've done this for a while are tired of moving around the country, rebuilding their lives every six or seven weeks."
"As a freelance director," he continued, "you have to direct so much, and direct almost everything that comes along. You work so hard, and so often, that you begin to dislike the work. A lot of people now hope that if they get a series, they can pick and choose what they do. Most of the people that I grew up with in the theater are working consistently in television."
Indeed, Mr. Epps's experience is just a small part of a significant but virtually unnoticed displacement of creativity. In the 1950's, when live television drama flourished in New York, a playwright like Paddy Chayevsky could move naturally between mediums, but after that decade, there was no prominent nexus between the theater world and television for many years. In the last decade, the constriction of commercial theater and the cuts in public arts financing changed that: a bridge -- or perhaps an escape ladder -- was built, and it is being used more and more.
FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS, there has been a steady flow of directors, producers and playwrights out of the theater and into television, and not primarily into high-toned PBS series like "American Playhouse" but into mainstream commercial television. And almost all of these people -- unlike actors, for whom the back-and-forth between stage, film and television is easier, and virtually required -- are people who grew up dreaming that they would spend their lives in the theater.
"During the second year of 'Murphy Brown,' I went back to New York to do a show at the Manhattan Theater Club," said Barnet Kellman, an accomplished television comedy director with deep roots in the theater. That was in 1989. "It was amazing to me how many of my friends in the theater world came up to me and said: 'How can I get out of the theater? How can I break into television? Help me, help me.' "
What effect these defections have had on television, which by many accounts has improved in the last 10 years, is difficult to characterize, Mr. Kellman added. But the effect they have had on the struggling world of American theater is clearer. "It can only be described as an absolute brain drain going on in the theater," said Mr. Kellman. "I mean, they used to talk in the old days about actors being grabbed by Hollywood. But look around. How many directors over 40 have you got in the New York theater? You can count them on one hand."
There are certainly talented people who could make the switch but don't, for creative reasons. The playwright Nicky Silver ("The Food Chain") explains such a choice this way: "For the theater, I write something that fascinates me and I shop it around. In television, you're told what to write and then you hope it becomes fascinating." But what is also certain is that behind the scenes, prime time is swarming with theater emigrants.
Mr. Kellman was the first-season director of CBS's "Murphy Brown" and of NBC's "Mad About You." Before that, he directed the original New York productions of "Key Exchange," "Breakfast With Les and Bess" and "Danny and the Deep Blue Sea."
Matt Williams, the creator and producer of ABC's popular "Home Improvement," was a New York playwright who had several of his plays produced Off Broadway before he switched to television.
Since 1986, Craig Anderson, the founder of the Hudson Guild Theater in Manhattan, has been working in Los Angeles, producing network movies and mini-series, including August Wilson's "Piano Lesson" and the recent NBC potboiler "Dead by Sunset."
Still other examples are Theresa Rebeck, the Off Broadway playwright ("Spike Heels," "The Family of Mann"), who is now a staff writer with the rank of co-producer on ABC's "N.Y.P.D. Blue," and David Trainer, a producer and director of ABC's "Maybe This Time," who directed the original Broadway production of "Foxfire" and the Off Broadway production of A. R. Gurney's "Dining Room."
In addition to these people and many others like them, there are numerous costumers, scenic designers and other craft people from the theater who now work primarily in television.
"What I tell people who are interested in joining us is that you have to have a flexible spirit," said Janet Blake, a vice president for writer development and special projects for Walt Disney Television who spends much of her time combing colleges, regional theaters and theater festivals for talent. "You'll have to give up your disdain. And if you stick with it, you'll get a chance next week to do it again."
Over lunch recently in the Sony Studios commissary, near his office on the Culver City movie lot, Mr. Anderson said: "When I was in New York, I looked down my nose tremendously at people who had 'sold out' and gone to L.A. I always thought it was just that, selling out. I'd say: 'Well, there goes another good person. How dare they give the theater up for the commercial crassness of that town!' I thought that way about those people -- that is, until I myself became one. And in hindsight, I probably should have come out here five years earlier."
The 47-year-old Mr. Anderson smiled ruefully. As with most of the theater people who have succeeded in making the transition to television, his journey has been a complicated one. He spoke wistfully about the excitement and challenge of live theater. "The theater is very special," he said. "It's a great training ground."
A Los Angeles native who was a U.C.L.A. theater major, he moved east at 21 and worked at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn., before starting the Hudson Guild inside a settlement house on West 26th Street in the mid-1970's. "I had a theater in New York," he continued. "And I had the right to fail. I had the right to put on plays and learn from them. We painted the sets, and we focused the lights, and we had a small operation. And the theater grew. It became very successful."
Although most former theater people defend their current work as significant and demanding, few have unalloyed praise for television, with its production-line methods and homogenized writing. Mr. Anderson is no exception. Unlike television, he explains, theater allows for the luxury of sufficient rehearsal time, of harnessing idiosyncratic voices and forms, of giving writers and directors control over their creations.
"And the kinds of plays that I was interested in in New York, the ones that I both produced and directed, were mostly plays about the human condition," said Mr. Anderson, who won a Tony Award as the producer of "Da." "They were plays about growth; they were plays about personal relationships. They could be comedies, but those were no exception. When I came out here, nobody really wanted to know from that. And they still don't, for the most part."
Other theater emigres offer a different sort of backward glance.
"I think the New York theater world -- and that includes the audience, too -- can be smug and elitist," said Ms. Rebeck. "Sometimes I worry that the American theater will evolve into something where the only plays that will be done are by Terrence McNally and Tony Kushner."
Mr. Trainer said: "I once directed 'Painting Churches' at the Long Wharf Theater. I remember going one night to see it. I stood in the back of the house and noticed that everybody in the audience had white hair. I thought: 'I'm spending my life entertaining a generation older than I am. Is that really what I should be doing?' "
But these observations, savvy as they may be, are secondary to the primary force pushing theater people into television: the soul-numbing economics of theater work in contrast with the relatively astronomical sums paid to talented people in the television industry. (An established staff writer for a television series can easily earn $5,000 a week, for instance.) Everyone has a story.
"It took me three years to get my first play produced in New York," said Mr. Williams of "Home Improvement." "My gross profits: $3,800."
Recalling the early 80's, Mr. Kellman said: "While 'Key Exchange,' which I had directed, was running at the Orpheum, I directed different productions with different casts in Dallas and Los Angeles. I'd already done the original production, at the W.P.A. Theater, for nothing. I think we got $200 for carfare. For doing all of that, I made less than $20,000. And that was my red-letter year in the New York theater."
IN THE LAST YEAR, MR. ANDERSON earned more doing television than he did in his 16 years doing stage work put together, he said. In the mid-1980's, he had a plan to earn a viable living in New York: form a syndicate to purchase Town Hall on 43d Street and turn it into two 500-seat live theaters. "We were ready to break ground," he said. "Then the Landmarks Commission stepped in. They turned Town Hall into a landmark, which meant we couldn't change the mildewed carpets or the broken seats without petitioning them."
The plan fell through, and shortly thereafter Mr. Anderson left in frustration for Los Angeles, where he drifted into producing television movies after several feature-movie projects fell through.
There are many routes from theater into television, some rockier than others. Matt Williams made the leap when one of his one-act plays fell into the hands of the television director Jay Sandrich. Mr. Sandrich, who was helping start "The Cosby Show" for NBC, commissioned an episode from Mr. Williams, despite the playwright's protest that he "couldn't write jokes."
Mr. Kellman, who had been "supporting his theater habit," as he puts it, by directing daytime soap operas in New York, was enticed to Los Angeles by James Burrows, the director and producer of "Cheers," to direct the first three episodes of "All Is Forgiven," a short-lived 1986 sitcom. Then came "Murphy Brown" in 1988.
Are the real classics now not theatrical works but popular television shows like "Murphy Brown" and "N.Y.P.D. Blue," shows seen so often by so many people that despite network homogenizing they do have real impact on American society? This is a lively topic of discussion on both sides of the theater-television fence.
"I guess I sound a little self-serving," said one playwright-turned-television-writer, "but my old theater friends who like to turn up their noses at television are martyring themselves for a medium that's almost totally irrelevant."
Still, among many former theater people, there is common longing for the freedom and immediacy of live theater. "I'd rather be making a living in the theater if I could," said a prominent television scriptwriter, after recounting several hair-raising tales of being rejected or totally rewritten. "It would be my own work. I wouldn't have to answer to anyone else."
Some try to take their television bounty and recarve a space in the theater for themselves. Craig Anderson is holding readings for Bill C. Davis's play "Avow," which he would like to produce on the East Coast.
Others, like Barnet Kellman, frame their old theater posters and hang them on their production-office walls. Chances are that Mr. Kellman will spend the rest of his career in Hollywood, but he wants to leave the door to the past ajar.
"When I go to see a good play," Mr. Kellman said in his office at Warner Brothers Television in Burbank, "I say, 'Oh, my God, I miss the theater.' You know something? If someone asked me to direct 'Angels in America' tomorrow, I would drop everything I'm doing, clear my calendar and go do it."

Daughters of the Great Depression
Women, Work, and Fiction in the American 1930s.
By Laura Hapke.
Illustrated. 286 pp. Athens:
The University of Georgia Press. $45.
 The Great Depression created immense hardship for millions of Americans, bequeathing a legacy of impoverished expectations that stunted an entire generation. Because masculine identity in the United States is so closely bound to work, this economic cataclysm has been viewed as a crisis that affected male workers. Overlooked, and often erased from history, are the 11 million women -- a quarter of all American women -- who worked outside the home. 
 Ever since the American Revolution, women have encountered enormous opposition in the paid labor force, especially during periods of economic contraction that starkly expose the cultural biases against women workers. In this carefully researched and detailed study, Laura Hapke, a professor of English at Pace University, examines the conflicts and tensions centering on the lives of women wage earners in the Depression.
 Exploring a wide range of texts -- from novels and short stories by Erskine Caldwell, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Sinclair Lewis, Claude McKay, Margaret Mitchell and John Steinbeck to articles in business magazines like Fortune, documentary photographs and films, as well as reports of the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor -- Ms. Hapke demonstrates that working women, whether industrial workers or professionals, were scapegoats for the widespread economic and psychological conflicts and tensions felt by women and men alike in an era of hardship and uncertainty.
 In the 1920's, women optimistically ventured to work outside the home, but the collapse of the economy reversed the progress working women had made. Ironically, during the Depression when more women than ever needed to support themselves or their families, female wage earners were often depicted as harridans who were out to steal men's jobs: if not as harpies, harlots or bad mothers, at best as office helpmeets to powerful men. But as Ms. Hapke points out, "In reality, only rarely did women and men compete for the same jobs. Nor did firing women insure men access to jobs; it only contributed to the downfall of households supported by women."
 The vehement debates of the 1930's between the traditionalists who promoted the back-to-the-home movement and the radicals who sought to merge the cause of working women with that of workers in general continue today. The fiction of the Depression era documents the collective guilt associated with women wage earners, whether they were stenographers, teachers, nurses, domestics or workers on an assembly line. Even radical writers like Tillie Olsen, Meridel Le Sueur and Agnes Smedley had difficulty envisioning a woman in command of the material circumstances of her life. Ms. Hapke argues that instead of insisting on equal opportunity and compensation, these champions of the proletariat undercut the needs of women who worked outside the home by portraying them more as overburdened mothers than as workers who deserved respect for their ability to earn a wage.
 The deeply conflicted relationship between women and paid labor during the Great Depression is dramatically illustrated in Dorothea Lange's well-known photograph "Migrant Mother," one of a series taken at a farm camp in Nipomo, Calif. The gaunt, worry-creased face of Lange's subject, 32-year-old Florence Thompson, has become an enduring emblem of privation. Lange has explained that the woman looks harried because she was the sole support of her six children, and the pea fields where she worked had frozen over, forcing her to sell her few possessions for food. However, instead of acknowledging the fact that Thompson is a farm worker whose family depends on her wages, the photograph's label emphasizes her maternal role.
 Similarly, Ms. Hapke observes that in "The Grapes of Wrath," Steinbeck portrays Ma Joad as holding her family together through mother love while he ignores the importance of her long hours of farm labor, however poorly paid.
 In the 1930's, as today, millions of women anesthetized themselves against economic inequity by immersing themselves in pulp fiction and sensational melodrama. A few writers like Josephine Herbst and Tess Slesinger wrote novels out of the conviction that salvation came not from a man but from a good job, yet most fiction of the day dramatized the sentimental dimension of the narrative rather than the physical or intellectual challenges of paid employment.
 IN spite of all of the forces that tended to submerge the working woman, at least one novel with a powerful female protagonist became a best seller. As a resourceful and resilient woman who emerges from social and economic chaos in command of her considerable abilities, Scarlett O'Hara in Margaret Mitchell's "Gone With the Wind" helped to subvert the ideology of domestic femininity.
 Set in the Civil War and Reconstruction periods, Mitchell's novel provided a historical distance that allowed readers to identify safely with a heroine who prevails despite epic odds. Ms. Hapke writes that the popularity of "Gone With the Wind," which won the Pulitzer Prize the year after it was published in 1936, signaled the desire of a generation of women to pursue a life that encompassed work as well as love.
 With the onset of World War II and the opportunities for employment in munitions factories, on airplane assembly lines and in shipyards, women entered the work force in unprecedented numbers. As soon as the troops came home, however, women were once again urged to embrace the ideal of domestic femininity. Cultural constructions of gender roles continue to be powerfully affected by economic conditions. Ms. Hapke gives us a probing analysis of the way this process shaped the lives of Depression-era Americans.

Storming the Gates
Protest Politics and the Republican Revival.
By Dan Balz and Ronald Brownstein.
424 pp. Boston:
Little, Brown & Company. $24.95.
The Republican takeover of Congress in November 1994 caught even many of its supporters by surprise, but little more than a year later, it has become common to hear Republican strategists like William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, a conservative opinion magazine, describe 1994 as a realigning election, similar to the Democratic sweep of 1932. Dan Balz, a reporter for The Washington Post, and Ronald Brownstein, a reporter for The Los Angeles Times, have undertaken the first sober and extensive study of how the Republican takeover occurred and where it might lead. 
 Mr. Balz and Mr. Brownstein describe how, after the cold war's end, Republican conservatives, led by Newt Gingrich, forged a powerful new coalition among the Christian right, the advocates of term limits and property rights, the foes of gun control and business regulation, and Ross Perot supporters around the "central goal of limiting Federal power." In their view, "opposition to Washington has succeeded opposition to Communism as the unifying focus for the right." In 1994, this new Republican right was able to wrest control of Congress from the Democrats, who were crippled by the missteps of the Clinton Administration and by their own factional divisions.
Mr. Balz and Mr. Brownstein warn, however, that the Republicans' victory may not lead to a New Deal-style political realignment. For one thing, Republicans face what they call "the gusts of discontent that are billowing demands for new political alternatives." In 1992, Mr. Perot's independent candidacy helped defeat George Bush. In 1994, the Republicans were able to direct these winds against the Democrats, but in 1996 (if Mr. Perot runs) and in future elections, the Republicans could be blown away by them. "The persistent alienation that voters now express about the political system is a force inimical to electoral stability of any sort," the authors write.
In addition, as the Republicans expand their reach in the electorate, they are beginning to suffer from the same quarrels among a "collection of interests" that eventually paralyzed the Democratic Party. Like that of the Democrats, the Republicans' "driving energy" is increasingly lodged outside the party apparatus itself, in activist organizations and movements. The members of these movements narrow the "boundaries of permissible dissent" within the party on issues like abortion and gun control. They also don't necessarily get along with one another. While the members of the Christian Coalition and of Mr. Perot's United We Stand agree about economics, they don't automatically agree about social issues.
Mr. Balz and Mr. Brownstein chronicle at length the development of this new Republican coalition. Much of what they write, particularly about Mr. Gingrich and the Democrats, has appeared before, but not in one place and in such copious detail. Anyone who wants to understand contemporary American politics will find their book useful. But I have several reservations about their portrayal.
The authors accept the Republicans' description of themselves as "populist" tribunes for the aggrieved middle class. They repeatedly contrast the new Republican conservatism with the older "Wall Street" Republicanism, describing "Gingrich conservatives" as hostile to "Wall Street's influence," symbolized by President Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. And except in explaining Republican reluctance to embrace campaign reform, they ignore the central role of business lobbyists in the new coalition.
In fact, Mr. Gingrich, the new House Republicans and many of the key conservative organizations were heavily underwritten and influenced by corporate and Wall Street lobbyists. Mr. Gingrich's main political organization, Gopac, and William Kristol's Project for the Republican Future were both heavily subsidized by members of the Political Club for Growth, a group of financiers based in New York. Gopac, the Cato Institute and lobbies like Citizens for a Sound Economy were also underwritten by businesses that yearned for a Republican takeover of Congress. These included those securities houses and tobacco, defense, insurance and pharmaceutical firms that felt threatened by the Clinton Administration and the Democratic Congress.
Mr. Balz and Mr. Brownstein portray the Republican freshmen as representatives of populist gun owners and small businessmen, but they were also closely linked to corporate lobbies. Some freshmen were lobbyists themselves. Helen Chenoweth, from Idaho, represented Western timber and mining companies. Others, like David McIntosh, from Indiania, depended on industry lobbies for their campaign money. Mr. McIntosh, the former director of Vice President Dan Quayle's Council on Competitiveness, got at least a quarter of his campaign funds from the kinds of concerns that sought regulatory exceptions from the council.
Mr. Balz and Mr. Brownstein seem oblivious of this side of Republicanism. They say that a crucial meeting of House Republicans in early 1994 took place "without lobbyists present." They acknowledge that former Representative Tom Tauke was chairman of the Salisbury, Md., retreat, but they describe him as a "corporate executive." Mr. Tauke was then and is now the chief Washington lobbyist for Nynex, which has been a major player in the Republicans' telecommunications legislation.
It's not just a matter of whether the new Republican coalition deserves the term "populist." One can't understand what the Republicans have done in the last year without understanding the critical role that business lobbyists have played in their coalition. While the National Rifle Association and the Christian Coalition won a few token victories, the business lobbies have reaped their rewards in the Republican environmental, health care, defense and tax legislation. And the Republicans' current political problems stem directly from the public's accurate perception of this influence.
In explaining the populist appeal of the new Republicanism, Mr. Balz and Mr. Brownstein also play down its darker side. They acknowledge that racial division has been important in conservative Republicans' rise in the South, but they insist that Republican "racial appeals" are not the "principal reason" for the Democrats' decline in the South.
That doesn't square with recent history, beginning with Barry Goldwater's 1964 Republican Presidential campaign and George Wallace's defection from the Democrats in 1968. Race has been a crystallizing factor in just about every instance of Republican rise and Democratic decline. It was even central to the rise of the religious right. The authors date the religious right from the rise of the Rev. Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority in 1980, but it really began two years earlier when Mr. Falwell, Robert Billings and other previously apolitical evangelicals got together to lobby with new right activists against the Carter Administration's attempt to deny tax exemption to segregated Christian academies in the South.
A few conservatives like Jack Kemp and Bill Bennett have sought to alter the Republicans' identification as the white people's party, but they have largely failed. Most recently, some conservative intellectuals have even begun to entertain ominous racial theories to justify policies of malign neglect. In "The Bell Curve," Charles Murray, a fellow of the American Enterprise Institute, rooted black crime and lack of economic achievement in racial genetics. Mr. Balz and Mr. Brownstein once again appear oblivious. They describe Mr. Murray's book as the subject of "controversy," a description that might also apply to the Scarsdale diet or the designated hitter in baseball.
My second reservation about this book may strike some readers as asking more of "Storming the Gates" than its authors promise. When reporters write for their newspapers, they have to limit themselves to reporting facts and evaluating means, not ends. Like other journalists, Mr. Balz and Mr. Brownstein apply these strictures to their book writing. As a result, their book writing lacks passion and bite. But more important, they deprive the book's readers of their own considered judgments of the value of the Republican program. Only in the last chapter -- and in a timid equivocal manner -- do they attempt to evaluate ends, and not merely means.
This pursuit of objectivity has curious results. When the authors describe the Republican goal of blocking the Clinton health care bill without giving a view on whether doing so benefited Americans, readers may believe that they thought the Republicans were doing the country a favor in killing any chance of universal health insurance. Mr. Balz and Mr. Brownstein correctly see Mr. Quayle's White House office as a way station in the Republican revival, but, concentrating on its instrumental role, they describe it as one of "the pockets of conservative innovation" for "such ideas as regulatory and legal reform." Conservative innovation? Most of these ideas had been pressed by business lobbyists for years.
Because the authors cannot finally screen out all moral and political judgment, many of their own sentiments are embedded in their use of pejorative descriptions. They describe California's Proposition 187 as being an "anti-immigration ballot initiative." (In fact, it was aimed at illegal immigrants.) They describe Representative Richard Gephardt's trade position in the 1988 Presidential year as "protectionism." (In fact, it reflected a strategy of trade reciprocity.) They write that Mr. Perot's indictment of the two-party system is like a "small-town grocer complaining about the new Safeway," while Bill Bradley "invests the argument with a different kind of credibility." (In fact, Mr. Perot's indictment has proved far more significant, if not credible.) After reading these statements, I got an inkling of where Mr. Balz and Mr. Brownstein stood on immigration, free trade and Ross Perot, but not why, or what implications these positions had for their view of America's political future.
In the book's last chapter, the authors do cast doubt on whether the Republicans' anti-government agenda, translated into legislation, will have its promised effect of buoying up the economy and quelling social unrest. But rather than taking a firm position, they fall back on the journalist's pose of enlightened skepticism, invoking opposing experts to justify their own lack of resolution: "Some private economists" expected a balanced budget to achieve "dramatic results," while "other economists warn that rapidly reducing the deficit could slow the economy in the near term." This is fine for a newspaper analysis, but not for an extensive study of contemporary politics.
Mr. Balz and Mr. Brownstein have given us a good start toward understanding how conservative Republicans won control of Congress. But we need not only a fuller understanding of that process, including the role of business lobbies, but also a lively evaluation of the ends, or goals, of politics, one that is informed by moral judgment and historical understanding. For the most part, that is missing from this otherwise excellent book.

SPIKE, MIKE, SLACKERS & DYKES
A Guided Tour Across a Decade of American Independent Cinema.
By John Pierson.
With the conversational collaboration of Kevin Smith.
Illustrated. 371 pp. New York:
Miramax Books/Hyperion. $22.95.
IT is difficult lately to tell whether Hollywood is trying harder to imitate the independent films or the indies are trying harder to imitate Hollywood. Perhaps no one is more tormented by this than John Pierson, a producer's representative who has given more American independent directors their start in the last 10 years than any other person or agency in the industry, but whose own roots lie in the esoteric world of art films and repertory houses. Idealistic, grudge-holding, visionary and defensive, Mr. Pierson is someone few outside the film industry are aware of. Yet without him Americans would not have heard so soon from Spike Lee, Michael Moore, Richard Linklater and a host of other directors whose unconventional visions brought the lives of blacks, the unemployed, homosexuals, hoop dreamers and other marginalized Americans to the silver screen. 
 In "Spike, Mike, Slackers & Dykes: A Guided Tour Across a Decade of American Independent Cinema," Mr. Pierson races the reader at breakneck speed through mazes of alleyways and up the vertiginous escalators that have led both him and independent films from obscurity to the big time. The book "is not a how to, it's a how come," Mr. Pierson says, and taking himself at his own word, he proceeds to relate every imaginable business detail of the past 10 years, from first meetings to deal making and deal breaking, from contracts and expense sheets to distribution. Somehow the glut of information doesn't slow the book down. The deals, enlivened by the author's brio, never lose their human complexion, even when, using the book as a kind of scrapbook, Mr. Pierson sticks in the actual documents that were the residue of the agreements -- like all four pages of Michael Moore's rights-and-distribution contract for "Roger and Me," or Kevin Smith's hand-scrawled list of the credit card cash advances he used to pay for his film "Clerks."
Mr. Pierson, who has lived, breathed and hunted film for most of his adult life, covers his territory with urgency and conviction, and his single-mindedness is ravishing. When he mentions the Sundance Film Festival of 1991, which occurred simultaneously with the gulf war, he comments blithely: "With so many films to watch and debate, it was difficult to worry about the Middle East." When he tells of years-old grievances and betrayals, you can hear him pounding his desk. When he alludes, in asides, to the misfortunes of his enemies, you can't miss the vengeful cackle in his tone (at Cannes, meeting the Samuel Goldwyn Company's Larry Jackson, who bid insultingly low on "She's Gotta Have It," losing the film and millions for Goldwyn, Mr. Pierson crows, "I mentioned that I could hardly keep track of the zeroes"). But when he tells of the successes of the directors he has nurtured and loved, you can see him smile.
No matter how many millions he's made, Mr. Pierson, now 41, still sides with the underdogs and not with management, still craves to see and understand with a youthful eye. It is telling that his book is broken up by one-on-one interviews between Mr. Pierson and his 24-year-old protg, Kevin Smith -- in which Mr. Pierson asks the questions. In one interlude, Mr. Smith says Mr. Pierson is just a glorified video clerk, like the stars of Mr. Smith's film. "You take something you find that you're really into like 'Clerks' and take it to the people. So in essence you're a very selective, very finicky video clerk." Mr. Pierson is delighted with this impertinence, although he can't help pointing out that he has a college degree.
The pride Mr. Pierson takes in his directors is like the admiration of a parent for a child, or even, disarmingly, like a little brother's respect for an older sibling. Spike Lee is "my hero," Mr. Pierson says at one point, and when he adds, "My life changed when his life changed," it's clear he's not just talking about cash flow.
ALWAYS fast, always personal, Mr. Pierson plows through the years director by director, film by film, child by child (he gets married along the way), dropping in news here and there of the immolations and rebirths of assorted indie studios and Hollywood executives. He's not afraid to acknowledge his own mistakes. In one chapter, titled "Amongst Jerks," Mr. Pierson rails against the director Rob Weiss, whose acquaintance and whose film, "Amongst Friends," he wishes he had never made.
Mr. Pierson is too resilient to let one bad experience keep him down, however, and sure enough, he bounded from Mr. Weiss to the much happier finds of Mr. Smith and the duo of Rose Troche and Guinevere Turner, whose wry, observant lesbian film "Go Fish" came out in 1994. They "made me feel young again," he writes. "Their good fortune was my redemption." Taking advantage of this surge of youthful vigor, Mr. Pierson wraps up the book and the indie film decade with a surprise slam dunk called "Hoop Dreams."
Ironically, Mr. Pierson worries that the increased fame and stature he has helped bring independent films may be their undoing. Ever since Steven Soderbergh's 1989 film, "Sex, Lies and Videotape," showed that indies could not only take Sundance but could take in millions at the box office, Hollywood has courted new film makers heartily. Indeed, ever since "The Crying Game," "The Piano" and "Pulp Fiction" grossed tens of millions of dollars, Hollywood seems intent on crushing the luscious new directorial jailbait with its overeager embrace. Mr. Pierson fears that in the face of such temptation, "the desire to make a film, any film," will replace "the need to express a vision," and he asks if heightened expectations for indies are creating "more opportunities or problems for traditional, smaller debut features." It is, as he writes, a "million-dollar question." Mr. Pierson can hardly be expected to solve it. As he admits early on: "I don't necessarily have all the answers." Nonetheless, it is reassuring to reflect that if this last decade is any sign, he can be counted on to spot the people who will.

Gauging the Impact on Housing of AT&T's Layoffs

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
AT&T's plan to split into three smaller companies and cut up to 7,000 employees in New Jersey is another hard knock for the state's housing industry, which ended 1995 on a downward spiral.
The layoffs are planned over the next three years, with 4,900 of the cuts in 1996. Some 2,650 employees have already accepted voluntary severance packages and about 800 more have received pink slips. The consensus of economic forecasters and realtors is that the ax-wielding at a company that has come to represent stability has pushed a low level of consumer confidence even lower. 
 The question is whether the housing market will take the layoffs in stride or slide into a downturn. Most industry analysts don't expect the worst. "Such corporate downsizings always have some negative impact, but it is never the extent that people think." said Michael T. Robinson, president of the Weichert Relocation Company. This is particularly true in a market as diverse as New Jersey's, he added.
The impact is expected to be strongest on counties like Somerset, Morris, Middlesex, and Union where a concentration of AT&Temployees work. But real estate agents in those areas insist that the layoffs will not flood their markets with homes or depress prices, just as it did not with past job cuts by Johnson & Johnson in Somerset County and Exxon and Allied Signal in Morris County.
"People expect hundreds of homes to go up for sale in Basking Ridge and that is not going to happen," said Sue Humphrey, president of the Somerset County Board of Realtors, referring to the community where AT&T has its world headquarters.
One of those at AT&T who will sell his home is Peter R. McCarthy, vice president of sales, development and operations at the company's microelectronics headquarters in Berkeley Heights. Mr. McCarthy, who has held various positions there for the last 32 years, accepted a voluntary severance package in November, speeding his planned retirement by a few years.
"The package made it financially satisfying to retire now," said Mr. McCarthy, who is 54. He and his wife, Ellen, a tax preparer, plan to sell their single-family home in Madison this spring or summer and move to Maine. But Mr. McCarthy said he was concerned about selling his six-bedroom colonial given today's economic realities. "We are certainly anxious but know the influences on the market can shift the demand picture," he said. "But not so anxious that will we sell at a fire-sale price."
The Economic Advisory Service at the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University in New Brunswick has forecast that the AT&T layoffs will reduce the state's annual employment level by 3,200 jobs this year. Using a multiplier factor, jobs will be reduced by 10,000 in 1997 and by 12,800 in 1998 compared with previous expected levels for those years. As a result there will be a small rise in the unemployment rate and a slower population growth by 1988, and between 1996 and 1998 1.6 percent fewer building permits will be issued than previously expected.
"No one should be crying wolf or whistling by the graveyard about the layoffs," said Norman J. Glickman, director of the research center. "But a lot of people may be downsizing their housing demand."
Ritch Blasi, a spokesman for AT&T, said that "it is important to realize that other parts of the business are hiring" including wireless communications and on-line services. But the real issue, Mr. Glickman and other analysts said, is that the AT&T layoffs come on top of other corporate restructurings like that at Public Service Gas and Electric and amid recent signs that the state economy, like the nation's, has stalled.
Evidence of that was the rise in New Jersey's unemployment rate in December to 7.3 percent from 6.1 percent in the previous month. Unlike the layoffs of 1993 and 1994, the latest round is taking place when job growth is faltering: Only 39,000 new jobs are to be created this year, a 17,000 drop from last year, state figures show.
And a Rutgers report issued two weeks ago showed that the housing market has "reached advanced middle age," and predicted that the number of building permits issued, on a downward trend since the 1950's, would remain sluggish through the 1990's. The report concluded that the number of permits was unlikely to top 30,000 during any of the remaining years of this decade because the state's "painfully slow recovery and the aging baby boom and the advancing baby bust generations have led to a major drop-off in houshold formations."
The last time that happened was during the Depression, according to the report by James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, and Joseph Seneca, an economics professor and vice president of academic affairs at the university.
INDEED, estimates are that the state ended 1995 issuing 7 percent fewer permits than 1994's total of 26,986 permits.
The job cuts by AT&T, Professor Seneca said, put out a cautionary flag to everyone else about their own employment prospects, and another damper on housing demand this year.
All these factors "provide a recipe for a housing trough," Dean Hughes added. For consumers "the economic tug-of-war in 1996 will be low mortgage rates versus the health of the labor market, and what may win out is immobility," he said.
Sales of existing single-family homes fell in the third quarter of 1995 to 38,500 from 39,500 in the comparable 1994 quarter, according to the New Jersey Association of Realtors in Edison. And estimates are that the state will wind up 1995 with 7,000 fewer homes sold than the 145,400 sold 1994, or a total of 138,400 homes.
It is the combination of uncertain state and national economic conditions with a wicked winter season, more than the AT&T layoffs, that has given the market a lethargic sales start for 1996, said Peter Mosca, a spokesman for the association.
Whatever homes do come on the market as a result of the layoffs, he said, will come during the second quarter and be added to an already high level of unsold homes, which he estimates as a six- to nine-month inventory.
Until that backlog is absorbed, he said, house prices will remain flat. The median sale price in the state for 1995 is expected to be $148,000, down from $148,700 in 1994, he added.
"There's always a period of hesitation and people will delay trading up or buying the house of their dreams," added Elenore T. Stone, past president of the Morris County Board.
And the AT&T layoffs will cause housing buyers "to become more cautious, and the market to slow," Dean Hughes said.

HEADLINE: VIEWS;
Of Breweries and Water Wheels in 1890's Essex

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM 

 BODY:
These ordinary scenes, frozen in old photographs from the 1880's or 1890's, capture a sense of Essex County as it struggled and prospered and grew from verdant pastures and meadows into the densely packed urban-suburban environment of Newark and its suburbs in the 20th century.
In their pictorial history "Remembering Essex" (Donning Company, 1995), the historians John T. Cunningham and Charles F. Cummings use 275 photos to compile a record of everyday life in a place of farms and factories, workers and beer barons. Pictures date from the eve of the Civil War -- a family portrait on the steps of a High Street home in Newark -- to a recent contemporary image of the Seton Hall University basketball team. 
 In the sampling here, the authors have chosen to remember and memorialize Essex through its people as well as its achievements. Newark was already flexing its muscles, at the Ballantine brewery as well as in the heart of the downtown business district, where the Fireman's Insurance Company building displayed its Victorian majesty at Broad and Market Streets. Yet in nearby Millburn, even in the age of steam and at the dawn of the age of electricity, Smith's Mill continued to provide water power for a thriving paper company.
The quaint and the modern are everywhere apparent. At the Prudential Insurance Company in Newark, still a keystone of the city's economy, no employer in the county retained a larger female work force. And at an old school in Millburn, the authors seem to invite the reader to find someone without a hat. CHARLES STRUM

I was struck with how Suge Knight has incorporated so much of the vision of Newt Gingrich's America -- two-fisted capitalism, with no concern for the larger society. It's odd that Bob Dole and others are so quick to criticize Knight for his supposed deleterious effect on society, but they never complain about the huge corporations that lay off thousands of workers for quick proft. Which is worse -- unemployment or a few "dirty" words on a sound recording?

BYLINE: By LAUREL GRAEBER 

 BODY:

THE LAST SHOT: City Streets, Basketball Dreams
 By Darcy Frey. Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $11.
 A prevalent myth in the American ghetto is that athletic achievement -- particularly in basketball -- will provide a way out of poverty. As the author discovered at a high school in Brooklyn, this belief often helps perpetuate scholastic and professional failure. "This book -- compellingly written, with elegance, economy and just the right amount of outrage -- should be read by every parent who has a child involved in school sports," Brent Staples said here in 1994.

 THE UNUSUAL LIFE OF TRISTAN SMITH
 By Peter Carey. Vintage International, $13.
 The man of the title, deformed at birth, is as crushed by circumstances as his fictional nation, Efica, is by the heavy hand of imperialism. As an adult he travels to Voorstand, the country that has colonized his own, where he encounters a culture in love with its own technology and the pulp creations of its entertainers. Last year our reviewer, Carol Shields, found Voorstand eerily reminiscent of the United States, where the novel's Australian author now lives. "The first two pages are enough to tell us we're in the hands of a master storyteller," she wrote. Vintage International has also restored to print Mr. Carey's first novel, BLISS ($12), published in 1981. The story of an average 39-year-old man who is resuscitated nine minutes after his heart has failed, it presents the near-death experience as less of a moral regeneration than a wake-up call to sin. It is "engagingly unappetizing" and "written with enormous verve and malice," Howard Jacobsen said in these pages in 1985.

 BOB DOLE: The Republicans' Man for All Seasons
 By Jake H. Thompson. Primus/Donald I. Fine, $12.95.
 This biography, recently updated, charts the career path of the Senator who presents the most formidable political challenge to President Clinton. It portrays him as a man whose strength and resolve have consistently enabled him to overcome adversity. The author "provides a glimpse of how complex this man who longs to be President is," Janet Hook wrote in the Book Review in 1994. For another personal look there is BOB DOLE, by Richard Ben Cramer (Vintage, $11), excerpted from the author's 1992 book, "What It Takes: The Way to the White House." Our reviewer of "What It Takes," Laurence I. Barrett, said, "In describing Mr. Dole, Mr. Cramer . . . gets closer to this very private man's core than any other writer has."

 SECOND MARRIAGE
 By Frederick Barthelme. Grove, $11.
 Love isn't necessarily better the second time around, especially for Henry, the narrator, who is trying to patch together a marriage that seems destined for the same end as his first. Set in a stultifying suburbia where passion of any kind is largely absent, Mr. Barthelme's first novel "registers acutely a world in which everything occurs obliquely," Ron Loewinsohn wrote here in 1984. Grove has also restored to print the author's first short-story collection, MOON DELUXE ($12), which features men, middle-class and mostly middle-aged, who tread warily around the edges of sexual relationships. The book is "engaging, observant and at times downright whack-in-the-solar-plexus mean," Margaret Atwood said in the Book Review in 1983.

 PICTURES AT AN EXECUTION
 By Wendy Lesser. Harvard University, $14.95.
 The author's subject is murder: specifically, our endless fascination with it in art and in life. The core of her investigation is a trial in 1991 in which a San Francisco public television station sued over the right to broadcast an execution at San Quentin prison. Her work is "full of shrewd observations . . . and acerbic asides," George Stade wrote here in 1994.

 THE NATURE OF LONGING
 By Alyce Miller. Norton, $10.
 The desire for connection -- between lovers, between races, between any two people who are fundamentally different -- is the theme of these eight stories, which won the Flannery O'Connor Award for Short Fiction in 1994. The collection "convincingly presents a variety of complex characters, all of whom yearn for what they lack," Gardner McFall said in these pages.

 NOW
 By Lauren Bacall. Ballantine, $6.99.
 In a celebrity memoir refreshingly devoid of gossip or rancor, the actress reflects on her life in recent years. Still devoted to her profession, she notes the conflict between her desire for solitude and her emotional dependence on family and friends. "The author is as likable as ever -- honest, funny and appealingly balanced between certainty and insecurity," Judith Viorst wrote in the Book Review in 1994. Another actress's world is evoked in GRACE, by Robert Lacey (Berkley, $6.99), the story of the young American film star who renounced her career to become Princess of Monaco. Its portrait of Grace Kelly is "a definitive biography with a shrewd final verdict," one critic said in 1994.

 SAINT
 By Christine Bell. Norton, $11.
 Susan, nicknamed Rubia by her South American husband, Federico, doesn't mind being a Yankee outsider on the family hacienda until she finds out her husband is having an affair. The first novel by the author of "The Perez Family," this tale of revenge offers "high comedy laced with the lessons of sexual warfare," Sara Vogan said here in 1985. Laurel Graeber

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
New Residential Space Arrives in Lower Manhattan

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
BEFORE the year is over, about 1,000 apartments are expected to be in construction in older office and commercial buildings in lower Manhattan. Developers are taking advantage of relaxed zoning regulations and new tax incentives aimed at assisting economically stagnant properties and bringing in more round-the-clock occupancy.
Some of these projects will be large-scale conversions. But as it happens, the first to begin marketing space after a construction start is a small-scale project that exemplifies the offbeat specimens of mixed residential, office and industrial use that the new incentives may occasionally produce. It will also test the market for large for-rent live-work spaces in the financial district. 
 The property is 47 West Street, close to the entrance to the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel and directly across from Battery Park City. It is actually three buildings on one tax lot. The tallest is the 12-story 47 West Street, named the Crystal Building for the family that once owned it. It is internally connected to 74 Washington Street, which is five floors lower. Combined they create 160,000 square feet of space, with lower floors of 15,200 square feet for printers and other businesses. The small third building is the three-story 50 West Street.
The Crystal Building was 90 percent occupied until about 1989, said Francis Greenburger, principal of Time Equities, the owner, a major co-op converter in the 80's but a commercial owner as well.
"Then one tenant went bust, two moved to Brooklyn and another went out of business," he said. "We had 26,000 square feet of nonresidential loft space vacant for two years." A tenant on the eighth and ninth floors of theWest Street building was moved to the large fifth floor, which runs through to the shorter building on the Washington Street side. That freed two floors for residential conversion.
Now the 8th through the 11th floors of the West Street building are being converted to live-work space, with a sizable 3,000 square feet in each space, two to a floor, and sunlight from four directions. The units will rent for $4,000 a month, or $16 a square foot a year. Residents will share a modest-sized lobby, redecorated in Art Deco fashion, with the commercial tenants. The Dime Savings Bank of Williamsburgh is financing the construction.
The long-term tenant on the 12th floor of 47 West Street is the Superior Group (formerly Superior Reproduction Systems), a copying, microfilm and imaging service that signed a new lease only a year ago.
"I have no heavy presses," said Michael S. Darvin, the chief operating officer. "I have no problem with people living below us as long as the people moving in know we're a functioning business, 24 hours a day."
N OR is Donald Kern dissatisfied. He and his partner, Arthur Baron, run Admiral Communications (formerly Admiral Photo Offset Company), a printing company founded by their fathers in lower Manhattan 50 years ago. Three weeks ago Admiral signed a 15-year, $10-million lease renewal for 49,100 square feet on three-and-a-half low floors. Time Equities agreed to build a new heavy-duty freight elevator for Admiral on the south side of the building, along Joseph P. Ward Street.
Does residential occupancy disturb Admiral? "It doesn't bother me one way or another," Mr. Kern said. "My machines are noisy but they're down in the building, on the Washington Street side."
The live-work units of 47 West Street are a modest precursor of residential projects to come in lower Manhattan. Crescent Heights Investments, a partnership of Bruce A. Menin, Russell Galbut and Sonny Kahn, has gutted the interior of the 500,000-square-foot 1901 building at 25 Broad Street, at Exchange Place, in preparation for construction of a residential building of 345 family-sized high-ceiling apartments. Crescent Heights has developed close to 6,000 apartments in 20 former apartment buildings or hotels, mostly in South Florida.
Another redevelopment candidate is 127 John Street, the 32-story, 550,000-square-foot office building completed only 25 years ago by the Kaufman Organization. It was purchased out of foreclosure last November by Rockrose Development Corporation, a large residential owner-builder. A major tenant, Prudential Securities, moved out of 150,000 square feet three years ago and the space was not rerented.
A few blocks away is the 66-story, 1.4-million-square-foot 40 Wall Street, recently purchased by Donald Trump. Despite speculation that its upper floors might be converted to residential use, Mr. Trump said that it would remain a pure office building. Most of it is vacant, a big reconstruction has started and Cushman & Wakefield has been retained by the Trump Organization as the leasing agent, Mr. Trump said.
Creating an environment that attracts residents requires more than apartments. "The key is to create a restaurant destination that makes people want to be there," said Tony Goldman, principal in Goldman Properties, who said he was prepared to open five of them over the next 24 months. Mr. Goldman owns 70 Broad Street and other nearby property. A brownstone converter, he owns and operates three hotels in the South Beach section of Miami.
The zoning changes that are fueling the residential conversion activity were adopted last summer. They affect pre-1961 buildings below Murray Street west of Broadway, and below the Brooklyn Bridge east of Broadway. One change allows apartments in these buildings to have an average gross square footage of 900. Previous zoning discouraged conversions with a provision that the average apartment size in a large portion of the building had to be 1,800 square feet. Also, developers are now allowed to provide on-site parking for 20 percent of the units, up to 200 spaces.
Another zoning change makes it easier to create live-work space in lower Manhattan by permitting up to 49 percent of the dwelling units to be used for the home occupation. The previous limit was 25 percent. Three employees may work in the space.
S PECIAL tax incentives were also introduced for lower Manhattan conversions. After completion of construction, a 12-year tax exemption is provided. It applies to the assessment established at that time for buildings that are wholly or substantially (more than 75 percent of the total space) converted to residential use. It phases out after the first eight years at a rate of 20 percent a year.
In addition, taxes attributable to the preconstruction assessment are abated for 14 years. The abatement is 100 percent for 10 years, and it phases out over the next. (Landmarked properties get an extra year on both the exemption and the abatement.) The exemption and abatement together let the converted building to start out tax free. Then, until the benefits phase out, it pays taxes only on the portion of subsequent assessments that reflect a rise in value.
To qualify for the full initial tax benefits when less than 75 percent of the property is converted, developers are likely to attempt to establish the residential space as condominiums. Their expectation is that then both the exemption and the abatement would be available. On this principle, the converted floors at 47 West Street are likely to become a condominium.
Other tax incentives in lower Manhattan benefit office and commercial lessees. One runs for three years and applies to new arrivals in pre-1975 buildings in lower Manhattan, or to tenants signing renewal leases renewals in such buildings. This benefit helped Admiral Communications at 47 West Street. Mr. Kern said it would save the business $250,000 over five years, and was a factor in its decision not to move.
Mr. Greenburger said that he got the idea of converting several floors in 47 West Street two years ago when he was visiting a friend at Battery Park City. "I looked out and saw the empty floors in my building, and I thought residential might work," he said. "It took two years to get a bank to agree to finance it."

The Governor's Midterm Grades

 BODY:
Governor Whitman is at midterm. How would you grade her performance so far?
 
Attracting Businesses
It seems that she has fulfilled her end of the bargain. I don't really see business leaving New Jersey, I see New York businesses running here.
 
ROBERT W. KULESSA

Big Losses, Few Gains 
 Governor Whitman has outrageously plundered the state work force, diverted funds from the retirement system, moved state aid from school districts, appropriated millions from the disability insurance fund and raised innumerable licensing and permit fees.
She now proposes to reduce the Department of Environmental Protection, reduce the level of services provided by the state, cut school aid even further, reduce prescription subsidies for seniors and cut state financing for state colleges and universities. All this for a saving of approximately $300 a year for a typical family.
 
PAUL HIRSCH

A Shrinking Constituency
Governor Whitman's performance has been merely adequate. Her only notable accomplishment has been the rollback of income taxes to something close to, but not quite as low as, the still-high pre-Florio level. The Governor attempts to appeal to Democrats and liberals who will never vote for her while hoping that conservatives stick with her. Soon her constituency will evaporate.
 
EDWARD J. ZOHN

Listing What's Wrong
An outstanding public relations job has masked these realities:
1. A phony tax program.
2. Devious accounting practices, raiding surpluses of various state trust funds and tampering with public employee pension system.
3. State spending has increased by $700 million.
4. The economy is faltering. . Our unemployment rate is one of the highest in the nation.
 
EDWARD A. FORMAN
Englewood Cliffs
 
Earning an A, and an F
Her promises of an income tax cut and a Howard Stern rest stop were kept. Her politial party controls the Legislature. To those who had such priorities, she earns an A. But for those who still have to pay the highest auto insurance premiums in the nation, or those recently laid off due to continuing budget cuts and corporate downsizings, or those who still object to gimmicrky in budget balancing, she gets an F.
 
JOHN BURY
Kenilworth
 
Shifting the Burden
I am unhappy with the way Governor Whitman has increased the burden on municipalities. Two areas in which I think she did a good job are requiring insurers to cover a 48-hours stay in the hospital after chirldbirth, and her effort in keeping the speed limit at 55 miles an hour.

HEADLINE: LOYAL OPPOSITION;
A Former Speaker Finds a Kindred Spirit on the Podium

BYLINE: By KAREN DeMASTERS 

 BODY:
BY now, Joseph V. Doria Jr. should be used to playing the part of the loyal opposition in the State Legislature. Mr. Doria, a politician from Hudson County, where Democrats once ruled unchallenged, is starting his fifth year as the leader of the minority party in the Assembly.
Although he acknowledges that the situation can be frustrating, and he knows he had more power in the days when he was Speaker, Mr. Doria says his current role is not entirely unrewarding. 
 "Do I get tired of being in the minority? Sure, everybody gets tired," said Mr. Doria, who will turn 50 in June and has served successive two-year terms in the Assembly since 1980. "But the minority creates a point of debate, and that's important. We have forced a lot of issues, like regulatory reform and state mandate, state pay."
And it is the leader of the minority party who determines the form and substance of that debate.
"The Democrats will be back," he said. "In New Jersey, the pendulum always swings back. It may be two years, or four years, but it will swing."
But Mr. Doria, who is an administrator at St. Peter's College in Jersey City and is working on his doctorate in education at Teachers College of Columbia University, said he had no idea if he would be part of that majority.
Even though he and his longtime running mate, Joseph Charles Jr., defeated their Republican opponents last November by more than 3 to 1, Mr. Doria said, "I take it two years at a time." He added that he hoped to remain involved in issues of public policy and education: he was a sponsor of the 1990 Quality Education Act, one of several unsuccessful attempts to to meet court-imposed guidelines to pay for public schools.
The personalities of the legislative leaders and the Governor often set the tone for dealings in the State House, and state government has seldom seen two more easygoing leaders than Mr. Doria and the new Speaker, Jack Collins, both of whom are educators. Mr. Doria is a big man, and despite a recent weight loss his appearance can make him seem unyielding and unapproachable. But even his political opponents say the impression is misleading.
"He is one of the gentlest legislators I know," said Donald T. DiFrancesco, a Scotch Plains Republican who has led the Senate since 1992 and is widely thought to have gubernatorial ambitions. Coming from Mr. DiFrancesco, who himself has been criticized for being too easygoing and willing to compromise, the description of his political rival is revealing.
"At times, I think he finds it difficult to be partisan," the Senate President said, "and I don't mean that in a negative way. I may disagree with him, but I can't help but like him."
When he has to, Mr. Doria is willing to take on the Republican majority and Governor Whitman, whom he sees as politically inexperienced and inclined to make promises she cannot keep.
"It's easy to cut taxes. It's hard to govern responsibly," Mr. Doria said of Mrs. Whitman's first two years in office. "The Governor's proposed budget is based on gimmicks and on overly optimistic revenue estimates."
What the state should be looking at now, he went on, are ways to guarantee the creation of new jobs; the administration has taken steps in that direction but has not done everything possible, he said.
"We have to put New Jersey in a position where people have psychological and economic security," Mr. Doria said. "Tax collections will be higher only if more people are working."
And reviewing education financing with an eye to providing equal educational opportunities for every child in the state will once again be a priority in the Legislature, he said, echoing the new Speaker, Mr. Collins.
Between his jobs in the Legislature and at St. Peter's College, Mr. Doria says he has very little spare time. His wife of nearly 18 years, the former Maribeth Keselica, who is director of testing in the Bayonne school system, is understanding of his busy schedule but does not participate in many political events.
Despite the demands of the job, Mr. Doria said he would encourage others to take the plunge into politics.
"I'd tell them to realize what they will sacrifice in family life and personal life," he said.
"It's much harder to be a legislator now than when I started, but it's very satisfying. These are more challenging times, but you can have a major impact on people's lives."

HEADLINE: Man of the House

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: ELMER

 BODY:
Jack Collins doesn't claim to be much of a farmer anymore. He no longer has time to milk his cows. The livestock on his small farm here in southern New Jersey share a ramshackle old barn, and sometimes they have to wait until 8:30 at night to get fed.
But when his brood of chicks began to disappear mysteriously last fall, it didn't take long for Mr. Collins to get rid of the culprit, a marauding barn cat. 
 "If you can't get along," he said, "you have to go."
These days, Mr. Collins, a five-term Republican lawmaker from Salem County, has another menagerie to oversee as the new Speaker of the General Assembly. He will not be able to dispose of members who block his agenda as easily as his former cat, but he will be controlling what bills come to the floor and will have a lot to say about whether they become law.
In his new role, Mr. Collins, 50, is the state's third-ranking elected official, after the Governor and the Senate President. He was elected unanimously by the Legislature's Republican majority to continue pressing the party's agenda of slowing government spending and cutting taxes. In the two-year-old administration of Christine Todd Whitman, a woman being watched closely by Republicans nationwide, that is no small burden.
Mr. Collins succeeds Chuck Haytaian, a Republican from Warren County who decided not to run for re-election last fall after an unsuccessful bid to unseat Senator Frank R. Lautenberg. Mr. Haytaian is now the chairman of the state's Republican Party.
Governor Whitman could count on Mr. Haytaian to drive her agenda through a sometimes balky Assembly. But some members of the Legislature say she may not have as easy a time persuading Mr. Collins to go along with her plans.
Mr. Haytaian used hard-fisted tactics to push through the Republican agenda. Mr. Collins is known for putting the concerns of his members first. Affable and easygoing, he prefers consensus over pressure to keep his 80 members -- 50 Republicans and 30 Democrats -- in line.
Yet despite his demeanor, the quick smile and the ready slap on the back, his colleagues caution against underestimating his ability to be tough.
"Anybody who would mistake his affability for being less than a strong leader would be making a mistake," said Assemblyman Gary W. Stuhltrager, a Republican who has represented the same district as Mr. Collins -- Salem County and parts of Gloucester -- since 1985, when they both arrived in the Assembly.
For his part, the new Speaker does not seem to mind being underestimated. "It is a great deal of power," he said one recent morning as he sat at his kitchen table with three mastiffs at his feet. "I've figured that out. I like to play the local yokel for those North Jerseyites. People say, Everybody seems to like Collins, but can he get those 41 votes?. We'll see."
The new Speaker will preside tomorrow over his first routine legislative session, wielding his gavel from the large raised podium in the General Assembly chambers that have been recently refurbished to their 19th-century splendor. The state's lawmakers first met there more than 100 years ago.
And to hear Mr. Collins tell it, the 207th Legislature will be confronting some of the same intractable issues that legislators have been wrestling with for decades.
AT his swearing-in ceremony on a bitterly cold afternoon last month, Mr. Collins said the most important issue facing the Legislature was public education, and he promised that this would be the year for New Jersey to resolve the debate over finding a fair way to pay for schools. He closed his remarks by noting that the last Speaker from Salem County, John W. Davis, had told his members the very same thing 34 years before.
The State Supreme Court has imposed a September deadline on the Legislature and the Whitman administration to come up with a plan to end disparities between the state's wealthiest and poorest school districts. Mrs. Whitman devoted her annual legislative address to education, and said she believed that improving public education would not require additional dollars.
Mr. Collins, who has appointed two new Assembly task forces to examine the issue, said he was waiting to see the Governor's detailed proposal and for his members to report to him with their findings before deciding what course to take.
"We will play a key role," he said. "We are the extension of the people. There is no greater issue touching the people of this state and not just kids. It touches parents, senior citizens, employers, future employers. We are going to be very involved."
The Legislature is facing other volatile issues that will require strong leadership by Mr. Collins and his counterpart, Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, a Republican from Scotch Plains.
The most pressing issue is replenishing the state's Health Care Subsidy Fund, which helps pay for hospital care for the poor.
The Legislature rejected Mrs. Whitman's proposal to raise cigarette taxes in December, and Mr. Collins and Mr. DiFrancesco are now trying to find other ways to come up with $400 million for charity care -- $300 million to be distributed to 84 hospitals and $100 million for the state's subsidized health insurance program for working families and individuals who are unable to obtain insurance through their employers.
Then there's balancing the state's $16 billion budget in a declining economy, providing cities and towns with property tax relief, coming up with ways to create more jobs as unemployment increases and taking on Mrs. Whitman's proposal to overhaul the state's welfare system.
So how does a nice guy like Jack Collins get at least 41 of his members to give him the majority he needs to reach agreement on these complex issues? How will he get along with Mr. DiFrancesco, the Senate President? And will he push through Mrs. Whitman's agenda as aggressively as Mr. Haytaian did?
To help him, Mr. Collins can draw upon a background that has nothing to do with Trenton politics but lots to do with getting through life, which in some ways may be the same thing: before he arrived in the Assembly, he was a farmer, lawyer, college administrator, basketball coach, graduate-level instructor and father of four.
Mr. DiFrancesco said last week that during the last four years, when Mr. Collins was majority leader, they worked closely and successfully together. "We have a good relationship," he said. "We've been together a lot."
Mr. Haytaian, who chose Mr. Collins as his successor, said he thought the new Speaker would provide strong leadership and continue the Assembly's close relationship with Mrs. Whitman. "He understands what has to be done in working with the Governor and the Senate President," Mr. Haytaian said.
But Mr. Collins, the son of a shipyard worker, is more sympathetic than many Republicans to organized labor and environmental issues.
In the final weeks of the last legislative session, he openly challenged Mrs. Whitman's proposal to change the way municipalities negotiate contracts with police and fire unions. Mr. Collins also publicly questioned the cigarette tax she proposed.
And in contrast to Mr. Haytaian, he is expected to listen more closely and respond more to the needs of his members and put them, in some cases, ahead of the Governor's.
"She's tough and I like her," Mr. Collins said about the Governor. "I don't always agree with her." But he added, "I sure don't think that we're going to go against her."
Governor Whitman said Mr. Collins had always been up-front and honest with her, whether they agreed or disagreed. "And when he said that he was going to do something, he always kept to his word," she said. "I look forward to that kind of relationship."
TO build consensus among Assembly members, Mr. Collins said his strategy was simple. He intends to listen a lot and involve Assembly members in the major issues.
"I think there has to be a lot more communication," he said. "I'm going to spend more time with the members. I want to know what they're thinking. They ought to know where we are."
Even some Democrats, who have been in the minority for the last four years, say they like his open, informal, friendly style and particularly welcome his commitment to involve the Legislature actively in solving the school-financing issue.
"He is saying that we need to be a part of the process," said the minority leader, Joseph V. Doria Jr. of Bayonne, who has a good relationship with Mr. Collins. "We need to play a role, which is important."
Despite his varied personal background, Mr. Collins says that in dealing with the state's problems he doesn't feel qualified to be all things to all people. He points out, for example, that he does not even handle the family's finances and that his wife doles out his allowance once every two weeks.
"And I'm going to be deciding the economic future on the state alone?" he said. "No. We have people who are accomplished individuals who know about things. I am going to ask everybody to have more of a stake in what we're doing. If they don't want to participate then don't be whining later when we go do something."
He said he believed that the chairs of legislative committees should have great power. "They should be able to massage the ideas, to convince their committee people to come together first.
"That lays the groundwork for the next step, which is to have a 41-member majority vote for something. How do you do that? You have to let people be part of the action. They have to be able to put something into it."
Of all of his work experiences, Mr. Collins says his years as a college basketball coach will help him the most in his new role.
Mr. Collins was a basketball star at Gloucester City Catholic High School and scored more than 1,000 points one year as a guard on the Glassboro, now Rowan, State College team. A few years later, as the coach, he guided the team to the division's national championship tournament. He left the job after seven winning seasons because while winning was wonderful, he said, losing became too unbearable for him.
"Part of coaching is knowing who your people are, what you can expect from them, what you can demand of them, what they are able to do," he said. "Then you look at them and try to put them together."
After coaching, Mr. Collins became an administrator at Rowan, earned a law degree at Rutgers in Camden, and now teaches graduate courses on education and the law at the college. He and his wife, Betsy, have owned their three-acre farm in Pittsgrove Township since 1974, when they traded in their Gloucester City row house for the rural life.
They raise pigs, cows, chickens, geese, peacocks and a couple of turkeys. "We will not get the great farming award, but we have fun," he said.
In 1985, Mr. Collins was approached by the state Republican Party to run for the Assembly. Until then, he had never been involved in politics and he thinks he might even have been a Democrat at the time. He beat a longtime incumbent Democrat.
TWO years after arriving in the Assembly, Mr. Collins gained notoriety in the State House during an emotional debate on the Assembly floor over easing the ban on leg-hold traps, an issue important to his constituents in South Jersey. To demonstrate that supporters of the traps also loved animals, he told a story of how he once gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to save a piglet's life. His colleagues laughed so hard that a recess was called.
A few legislators predicted the incident would damage Mr. Collins's political career. But two years later, when the Republicans lost control of the Assembly, Mr. Collins was chosen by Mr. Haytaian, then the minority leader, as his deputy.
It became a powerful position when the Republicans regained control of the Assembly and Mr. Haytaian was elected Speaker. Mr. Collins then moved into position as majority leader, ultimately to succeed Mr. Haytaian. He was then elected by the Republican caucus last fall.
Mr. Collins, the first Speaker elected from a mostly rural district in South Jersey in more than three decades, said he did not expect to have trouble understanding the issues that are of special concern to residents of North Jersey. Property taxes, for example, are a much bigger issue in the northern part of the state than in the south. He also objected to the notion that that he might not understand the problems of the urban poor.
"If there is any group in this state that is not understood, it is small urban communities, " he said. "They have all the problems that inner cities have, but no social programs, no public transportation. Poor problems are everywhere."
Now that he's Speaker, he said, he recognizes his responsibility to the entire state. "If you draw a line in the middle of the state, three quarters of the state's population live in the north," he said.
But don't expect to see Mr. Collins at many political fund-raising events or Rotary Club luncheons north of Trenton. He says he has no political ambitions beyond his present role, so he will not be spending much time trying to build statewide political support for some future campaign.
He will be relying heavily, he said, on his majority leader, Paul DiGaetano, a Republican from Rutherford, in Bergen County, to represent the Assembly leadership on many occasions. Unlike Mr. Haytaian and several other former speakers, who used the job as a platform to run for higher office, he says his aspirations end in the Assembly chamber.
As for being Governor someday, Mr. Collins said: "By appointment only."
Nor does he plan to spend every day in his State House office, like Mr. Haytaian. He will be keeping his full teaching schedule at Rowan. And there are all of his animals, waiting to be fed.
"We got phones, we got faxes," he said. Then he paused, as if realizing the extent of his new power. "And I decide when we meet. If I don't show up, no one else can."

HEADLINE: Spoil Dumped in Sound May Be Tainted

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
THE Navy may be using contaminat'd spoil to cap 1.2 million cubic yards of toxic-laden material that it dumped into Long Island Sound near Fishers Island, opponents of the project charge.
The dumping, which began in late 1994 and is to be completed early this month, dredged the heavily industrialized Thames River at New London to provide clearance for the Seawolf nuclear submarine at her home port. 
 The opponents, led by the Fishers Island Conservancy, said recent tests that they paid for had showed moderate levels of mercury, traces of dioxin and small amounts of other toxic substances in samples of the capping material used to cover over the spoils that were taken from the river and dumped in the Sound.
They said the results should compel further tests by the Navy before the capping is allowed to continue.
"Any capping material that goes out there should be very clean," the president of the conservancy, John H. Thatcher Jr., said. "This should raise a red flag."
Mr. Thatcher said that if additional contamination was found officials should recap the dump site with spoil that is certified as clean.
The Navy official in charge of the project, Robert K. Ostermueller of the Navy Facilities Engineering Command in Lester, Pa., did not return three calls to his office.
But an assistant commissioner in the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, Arthur J. Rocque Jr., said the capping material was clean and met Federal and state standards for marine projects. Mr. Rocque said recapping would be unnecessary and potentially harmful to the home of the clean material.
Capping, the final step in the project, entails dumping clean dredged material from the Thames on top of the larger volume of contaminated material at the site. In theory, a three-meter-thick cap seals contaminants on the bottom of the Sound.
The one-mile-square site, in use since before World War II, is one and a half miles from Fishers Island, in an area where opponents said strong currents would spread contaminants, particularly if they are in the capping material.
In December the privately hired testers took seven samples from river-bottom areas to be used for capping while Navy observers videotaped from a patrol boat.
Test results showed traces of pesticides and heavy metals. Mercury, one of the most toxic heavy metals, was present in five samples in moderate levels, according to standards set by the New England River Basins Commission. The amounts ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 parts per million.
Mr. Rocque said the results were consistent with Navy findings. He said the moderate classification referred to ground disposal, not to Federal standards for marine disposal. But Mr. Thatcher said the standards were the ones cited in the Navy environmental-impact statement for the dredging.
Although a portion of the disposal site is in New York waters, the Navy, the Army and Connecticut officials have said all dumping has occurred on the Connecticut side.
New York State challenged the project, saying New York permits might be needed because of the potential effects on the New York side. But the New York Attorney General's office dropped the legal action in Federal Court in Albany after Gov. George E. Pataki said in December that the dredging posed no damage.
The president of the 1,000-member Concerned Citizens of Montauk, Rav Freidel, attacked Mr. Pataki for "his support of the U.S. Navy's reckless poisoning of Long Island Sound."
Mr. Freidel said in an interview that the project "was done in the name of national security."
"Give me a break," he said. "Where's the war? I'll tell you where. It's in Long Island Sound, and its the Government against our fish and our fishermen."
Mr. Rocque said Mr. Freidel's assertion that the project had been rushed to completion by dumping seven days a week 24 hours a day since October was "extremely economical with the truth."
"We are very careful about this stuff," he said. "We really are."
But Mr. Thatcher said conservancy members, including himself, had witnessed dumping during high winds and strong tides. "That has been going on from Day 1," he said.
The conservancy and other organizations like the Town of Southold, the Fishers Island Civic Association, the Long Island Sound Lobstermen's Association, the North Shore Baymen's Association and the Concerned Citizens of Montauk sued in Federal District Court in Uniondale in the fall to stop the dumping.
Those groups argued that dumping contaminated material in the Sound violated the Federal Ocean Dumping Act, which now includes the Sound.
The Army, the Navy and the Environmental Protection Agency, the original defendants, argued that the dumping complied with all Federal laws. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, at its request, later joined the defendants.
After weeks of hearings Judge Thomas C. Platt ruled that the dumping could proceed. He said the opponents had failed to show that irreparable harm would occur if the dumping continued. By the time of his ruling the work was nearly completed.
The opponents have subpoenaed a Navy report that catalogued contaminants near the Groton submarine base, a Federal Superfund site. Mr. Thatcher said the large report had information about highly toxic conditions in the Thames.
Mr. Rocque said he was familiar with the report. "Reports like that are used to inform us about what we should be looking for," he said. "But if you have a compound in the marine sediment that is chemically bonded to the sediment, the amount of the material is relatively irrelevant."
He said many contaminants were bonded to sediments and remained so even when dredged up and dumped in the Sound.
Opponents have sharply different views. Mr. Thatcher said that the Navy made no tests for dioxin and that the cost of the samples, $2,000, limited the opponents to one test. But he said the tests showed that a number of the compounds were dioxin.
Dioxin is a highly toxic synthetic carcinogen that affects reproduction in fish, birds and mammals. "We found enough to show the Navy should have taken dioxin tests," Mr. Thatcher said. "We should have to pay for this."
He said the groups had spent nearly $100,000 for legal fees and expert testimony in the case in Uniondale.

HEADLINE: School Districts Upset By Pataki Budget Plans

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
AT a time when school districts are experiencing increasing enrollments and decreasing revenues, Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed cuts in the state education budget are expected to compromise the ability of superintendents to maintain instruction and other services at present levels without raising property taxes -- a move that could be restricted by some of the Governor's proposals.
"Under the guise of protecting the local property owner, these proposals are shifting the burden of costs to local property owners," said Dr. Vincent Beni, Superintendent of the Southern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services. "It's disingenuous. It's a very mean-spirited budget." 
 Although the state budget shows increased aid to 18 local districts, that is not quite the entire picture. What is at issue goes beyond a score card of which districts gain or lose in state-aid formulas.
"I could sit here and argue the pros and cons of specific proposals," said Dr. Stanley Toll, Superintendent of the Ardsley school district. "But in my view of the world, the entire package is polluted by two specific proposals: the supermajority requirement to pass a budget beyond the inflation rate, and the increase in aid to private and parochial schools. This is not very subtle. He's trying to turn around the decline in private and parochial schools and force the public schools to self-destruct. The Governor is trying to destroy public education in New York State."
Beyond the reductions in state aid to 22 local school districts for a combined $8.5 million loss, the Governor's proposed cuts in the state education budget, which were announced in mid-December, would affect special education and building aid, make reductions in the reimbursement levels that school districts receive for taking part in Board of Cooperative Educational Services programs, eliminate financing for teachers' centers and technology training and jeopardize others, like preschool education for disabled children and summer school programs for such youngsters.
Some educators estimate that the increased cost to state taxpayers would be at least $300 million.
"We're concerned about the cuts to Boces, special ed and the cap on building aid," said Lesley A. Purdy, district director for the Westchester Parent-Teacher Association. "We're watching what's going on."
During this budget preparation season, districts' energies have lately been focused on combatting those cuts and talking with state legislators. "We have been preoccupied with this for the last two weeks," said Dr. Anthony L. Mazzullo, Superintendent of the Greenburgh Central Seven school district. A community meeting last Wednesday, which was originally scheduled to inform the community on next year's budget projections, was used to discuss how the Governor's proposals would affect the district.
These cuts would lead to difficult choices for superintendents, who would have either to eliminate some programs or raise taxes to compensate for state reductions. Under the Governor's proposals, however, such tax increases would be sharply curtailed. He is seeking a requirement that would hold tax-rate increases to no more than the inflation rate unless a three-fifths majority of the voters approved a change.
"We're held to a rate-of-inflation increase with no accounting for increased enrollment or increased fixed costs," said Dr. Bruce Dennis, Superintendent of the Bedford public schools. "It would lead to an erosion of programs, and it spells bad news for us. Clearly, the effect on public education would be extremely harmful. A consequence would be to make public education less attractive to many people."
This so-called supermajority provision has raised fears among public school advocates that no future budgets could be adopted. Should a budget pass with less than a 60 percent majority, districts would be required to adopt austerity budgets.
"In effect, this gives a minority of voters the ability to block the budget," said Dr. Richard P. Mills, Commissioner of Education for the State of New York. "I disagree with that strategy. Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I was taught that in a democracy the majority rules."
County education leaders are especially worried about this proposed requirement, given the difficulties many districts already face in gaining voter approval for school budgets.
"To require a 60 percent majority is an extreme requirement," said Dr. Ronald Valenti, Superintendent of the Harrison public schools and president of the Lower Hudson Council of School Superintendents, which represents 80 districts in Westchester, Putnam, Rockland and Dutchess Counties. "I don't know of any other level of government that has that requirement. There's no logic to it. It's difficult to pass budgets in Westchester as it is. This supermajority proposal is unreasonable and the height of hypocrisy."
Dr. Toll said: "There's a paradox that the Governor has created with this proposal. If you do what's good for the kids, a minority of people can reject your budget. And if you do what the naysayers want, you lose your supporters. That's a very, very horrible thing."
Cuts to Board of Cooperative Educational Services aid, for example, do more than simply shift costs back to the districts. "Districts spent money this year, expecting to get aid reimbursement," said Dr. Beni, who observed that Board of Cooperative Educational Services ran its programs at no increase in cost over last year and reduced its administrative expenses to the local districts by 20 percent. "That's a very difficult problem," Dr. Beni said. "Our job is not to keep ourselves in business but to share program quality. There has been a covenant between the state and the districts, where the incentive has been Boces aid. This will make districts very reluctant to participate in a Boces service. If some districts participate and others don't, we lose economies of scale. All the things that Boces does well become very fragile. Without the aid, our costs will start to creep up again."
Dr. Mazzullo said: "What the Governor has done is shift responsibility from the state to the local property owner. If this is a trend, it's the beginning of the end of public education in the state of New York. The script is analogous to what happened in California. I've never seen school districts thrown into such a tailspin.
"We're on an austerity budget this year. We don't want another budget defeat. We have increasing enrollment, increasing certioraris and deteriorating buildings. This is a conservative Republican ideology that shows how draconian these measures are."
Dr. Beni said: "The districts are caught in a three-way squeeze. State aid is being reduced, district enrollments are rising as revenues are falling and then strike three is the supermajority provision."

HEADLINE: Rethinking School Busing In Yonkers

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
FIFTEEN years after a landmark Federal desegregation lawsuit was filed in this racially divided city, the firebrand leader of the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has questioned whether busing students across town to achieve a racial balance in classrooms is still worth the time and trouble, to say nothing of the cost.
But the leader, Kenneth W. Jenkins, who has been suspended from his post by the N.A.A.C.P. for publicly challenging busing, is not the sole voice questioning some of the basic tenets of the court-ordered desegregation remedy here. 
 Nor is he the lone rebel who thinks the 87-year-old organization needs to shift at least some of its priorities from the issues that were paramount in the civil rights era to other goals now also important to blacks -- like achieving economic parity with whites.
But it was not just the dissenting nature of what Mr. Jenkins said that troubled fellow members of the N.A.A.C.P. The branch president announced that "busing had outlived its usefulness" less than a month before Election Day last fall in a joint news conference with the city's Mayor Terence M. Zaleski, who was waging a hard-fought and eventually unsuccessful battle for re-election.
"More so than the statement -- although that was not consistent with the organization's policy -- Mr. Jenkins was mixing politics with being president of the branch," said Winston A. Ross, director of the Westchester Region of the New York State Conference of the N.A.A.C.P. "It gave the appearance that he was endorsing a candidate."
Mr. Ross also criticized Mr. Jenkins for "speaking out of turn," because the Yonkers desegregation case is still in litigation.
The second phase of the court-ordered education remedy, to erase vestiges of segregation in the classroom, has yet to be put into effect. The school district is appealing the ruling by Judge Leonard B. Sand of United States District Court, which holds the city -- but not the state also -- financially responsible for carrying out that phase.
Mr. Ross said that Yonkers was a landmark desegregation case and that "any actions taken locally have broad consequences." He added, "Normally, the national organization would not step in on something like this."
A hearing was held by the N.A.A.C.P. on Jan. 26 to examine arguments in the matter and determine whether the branch president should be restored to office, disciplined or ordered to step down.
The national board, which has indicated that it would decide the outcome by next month, could also take over operation of the local branch for a period, said William H. Penn Sr., director of branches for the N.A.A.C.P.
One member of the local branch, Gail Baxter, said that membership is down in Yonkers and that the group is "rife with factions." Accusations against Mr. Jenkins were brought by 11 fellow branch members who signed a petition calling for the president's suspension.
Among them were Ms. Baxter and Herman Keith, a former head of the Yonkers N.A.A.C.P. and a former Westchester County Legislator from the 16th District in southwest Yonkers. Ms. Baxter and others said Mr. Jenkins damaged the organization's credibility by his actions.
But the 34-year-old Mr. Jenkins denies that he spoke without the backing of his executive board or that he was using the press conference for political purposes. He has also not backed down on his position on busing.
He said last week that the money Yonkers now spends to bus more than 17,000 of its 23,000 children to magnet schools around the city would be better spent on upgrading classrooms. The district spends a total of $13 million a year for busing, including transportation for special education and other students.
Mr. Jenkins said his statement on busing was consistent with a 1994 N.A.A.C.P. policy statement proclaiming that the organization is concerned not only with "dismantling the structure of segregation" but also with providing a quality education for all black students.
Noting that more than 70 percent of the student population in the Yonkers schools is so-called minority, he said: "So what if a classroom is all black? Does that mean it's bad? Can't you have excellence coming from that?
"What we really should be worrying about is whether African-American kids are getting the right education and going on to college and jobs."
Although many have taken issue with statements like that, there are those in the black and white communities who support Mr. Jenkins's position.
In New Jersey last fall, another N.A.A.C.P. chapter president rebelled against the national organization's policies by opposing a proposal to desegregate a high school in Englewood.
That official, Robert H. Robinson, president of the Bergen County chapter of the civil rights organization, wrote in a letter to the New Jersey State Board of Education: "Racial balance is not the important factor here, equal and quality education is. There are studies that show that an integrated school does not necessarily provide quality education."
In Yonkers 10 years after the judge ordered the schools integrated, many acknowledge that the effort has not led to improved academic performance by minority students.
Statistics show that black and Hispanic students score nearly two grade levels lower than whites on local standardized tests, with no progress since the early days of desegregation.
The numbers also show that white students receive the overwhelming share of high school Regents diplomas and that black and Hispanic students are suspended at a disproportionately higher rate than whites.
But Joseph M. Pastore Jr., the court-appointed monitor for the desegregation of the Yonkers schools, said studies now under way indicated that other factors are at work in determining test scores. Those studies, he said, show that minority students who have had "a continuous affiliation" with the public school system over the last decade are scoring well.
Conversely, those whose families move often and are new to the school system score poorly on standardized tests and other measurements.
He said the intent of desegregation was not to raise minority students' test scores: "The question of whether desegregation is helping or hurting in this regard is not relevant. The court's interest is a constitutional one."
But Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the newly elected County Legislator from Mr. Keith's old district, said the tenets of desegregation need to be re-evaluated periodically.
"If the doctor gave out a prescription 10 years ago, he would be very remiss not to reassess it every so often," she said. "It is the same thing with this city's desegregation order. It has been in place a decade, and it's time to see if the solution still fits the problem."
Busing, Ms. Stewart-Cousins said, was always just a means to an end -- a way for minorities on the west side to tap in to the better education that was being offered on the city's mostly white east side.
But many middle-class white families have abandoned the school system in Yonkers for private and parochial schools -- what Mr. Ross called the whites' "opportunity to walk because they can afford to." Statistics show that white enrollment in the public schools dropped to 30 percent in the last decade, from about 53 percent.
Ms. Stewart-Cousins, who has two children in the Yonkers school system, said, "So why are we getting our kids up two hours early to take a bus across town to sit next to someone they would have sat next to if they had stayed in our own neighborhood?"
Like others in Yonkers, the newly elected Mayor, John D. Spencer, said he would also like to see busing abandoned. He said that even though Mr. Jenkins made his comments with the former Mayor, "that did not take away from his message."
"Busing in and of itself does not provide for a better education," said Mr. Spencer, who said he met with more than 100 members of the Alliance of African-American Educators of Yonkers last week. The new Mayor said he wants to reunite the school and housing portions of the Federal desegregation order as they were 10 years ago. The two parts were separated when the school district complied immediately with its part of the order but the city resisted complying with its part for five years.
Meanwhile, the conflict over Mr. Jenkins's statements is being closely watched by N.A.A.C.P. members in neighboring communities.
Gerald M. Coleman, president of the Mount Vernon branch, said he empathized with Mr. Jenkins, whom he called "a firebrand like myself."
"What's occurring in the organization is a shift from the post-civil-rights era to a more diversified view -- a re-engineering of the N.A.A.C.P, a redefinition of purpose," Mr. Coleman said. "The old views are being nudged out by a younger group who wants to become part of the political process. Maybe Ken Jenkins picked the wrong time to say what he did, but I understand what he was saying."
In Mount Vernon, Wilhelmena Strong, coordinator of the membership drive in that city's branch of the N.A.A.C.P., said: "I don't see what he said as helping or hurting. Mr. Jenkins is just someone who had an idea and stumbled in a sense."
But, she cautioned: "The organization can't afford to drop anyone. We can't throw any of our young people away."

Wrestling the Tax Devil We Know

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE B. GIBBS; Lawrence B. Gibbs is a member of the law firm of Miller & Chevalier in Washington and was Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service from 1986 until 1989. Frances B. Morgan, a lawyer with the firm, assisted in preparation of this article.

 BODY:
TWO hundred twenty years ago, our country went to war in part because of the unfairness of consumption taxes imposed by Britain upon her colonies. One hundred thirty-seven years later, in 1913, Americans went to the extraordinary length of amending the Constitution to replace domestic consumption taxes with the Federal income tax as the principal source of our nation's revenue. Since then, our income tax system has consistently raised the revenue needed to meet the Government's spending decisions. Through two world wars and a worldwide Depression, the income tax system has proven capable, flexible and dependable.
But today a national debate rages over whether we should retain this system or return to a consumption-based tax system. The decision is important and difficult and will affect every citizen and every business in this country. 
 The four proposals most prominently debated today -- the flat tax, the unlimited savings allowance tax, the value-added tax and the national retail sales tax -- have one shared feature (accomplished in different ways). None would tax the savings and investment income of individuals. Consequently, the proposals are variants of a consumption tax.
Proponents of consumption taxes argue that change is necessary because our income tax law has become too complicated, too burdensome, too intrusive as administered by the Internal Revenue Service, and too unfair to our citizenry. It was only nine years ago that I, then Commissioner of Internal Revenue, stood on the South Lawn of the White House to hear President Ronald Reagan proclaim that the newly enacted 1986 Tax Reform Act would make substantial changes in the income tax laws that were needed to restore "fairness, simplicity and economic growth." Now we are being told that our entire tax system must be replaced -- for reasons that do not differ much from the reasons given for the major changes we made over the last 20 years.
To be sure, our present tax law can be incredibly complex. At times, it can also apply unevenly and therefore unfairly among taxpayers. Because of certain biases in the present tax law, it can impede capital formation, encourage borrowing, discourage saving and diminish the competitiveness of American businesses in international markets. The I.R.S. is often its own worst enemy when it is unresponsive to taxpayers or deals with them in a heavy-handed way.
Even those, like the current Administration, who would choose to improve the present income tax system rather than adopt a consumption-based system agree that the structural deficiencies need to be addressed. The wisdom of taking a hard look at the present system is apparent. As a loyal supporter of my former agency, I endorse the view that the I.R.S. can and must improve the way it administers the tax law.
What is of deep concern, however, is that the present discussion of income tax versus consumption tax systems appears driven more by emotional attack and political agenda than by thoughtful analysis. No less disturbing is the recent spate of attacks on the I.R.S. Much of the rhetoric has been harsh, even provocative, like the headline in a weekly national magazine proclaiming "Death to the I.R.S." The Kemp Commission Report issued last month hints that the I.R.S. could be replaced by a "Taxpayer Protection Agency" whose purpose would be to assure that "no one pays more than is owed," but the report fails to explain how to assure that everyone pays what they owe.
To guarantee a reasoned and constructive national debate on the qualities we want in our tax system, it is imperative that all of us -- particularly our nation's leaders -- dispense with inflammatory assaults. Politically motivated attacks on our Government's programs and its agencies may carry an inordinately high price, as last year's Oklahoma City tragedy attests.
Although one would not know it from the rhetoric that speaks of "monstrous" complexity, the present income tax system is not, in fact, particularly complicated for the majority of Americans, especially the nearly three-quarters of taxpayers who claim the standard deduction instead of itemizing. The complexity faced by other individuals and business taxpayers is created primarily by two factors. The most important is the inherent complexity of our diverse, rapidly changing and sophisticated economy. The second is the degree to which Congress annually changes the tax laws to deal with the rising costs of Federal entitlement programs and the ever-higher interest costs of our increasing national debt.
To the extent that the tax law merely mirrors the complexity of our economy, it is doubtful that drastic simplification can be achieved by any tax system. To the extent that the complexity is driven by annual changes, if the United States gets its fiscal house in order, it is much more likely that some degree of the stability and simplification that we desire can be achieved with the present income tax system.
Proponents of consumption taxes are often critical of the so-called social engineering that is a perceived part of the current tax system. Some, for example, point to deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable contributions as unnecessary and inappropriate Government tax subsidies. Yet there is a longstanding public consensus in support of these deductions that suggests their repeal would cause economic dislocation and hardship. Over the last 80 years, the items of income and deduction that comprise the base of our Federal income tax system have become integrated into the United States economy. While some change in the tax base may be possible, a dramatic shift would undoubtedly have repercussions that could be quite damaging.
An example of this integration is the relationship between the Federal income tax system and the tax systems of our states and communities, whose taxes are often based on Federal law. So, too, are tax laws in many other countries, meaning that changes would have international ramifications, particularly for the business community.
It is remarkable that, thus far, the spotlight of public discussion has been focused on the rates of the various consumption tax proposals. But the key question in any comparison of alternative tax systems is not what the tax rate will be but rather what will and won't be taxed. The answer determines what will be included in the tax base, and the rate to be used will generally be a function of how much revenue must be raised.
Detractors of the present system assume that a new, untested tax base could be substituted for the current one and raise the same amount of revenue based on a particular rate schedule, but in the final analysis, this is more likely to be a leap of faith than a plausible revenue estimate.
In truth, we have taken for granted too long and too blithely the capabilities of our present tax system. For all its faults, the United States tax system is the envy of much of the world. We ought not exchange the tax devil we know for one we do not until we are confident that the new system is likely to work at least as well. The devil is in the details of tax base, not tax rates. Sound-bite tax proposals that promise easy solutions to hard problems are not the way to go.

The Gritty and the Gentry Battle for a Waterfront's Soul

BYLINE: By MARK FRANCIS COHEN 

 BODY:
Pockets of homes dot the industrially dominated streets of western Red Hook, where ships' men once lived and maritime voyagers slept. Today the link between home and work is gone: most residents work away from the area and the small-business owners largely live outside the neighborhood.
The tension has grown as residents who have moved in over the last five years or so seek to transform the commercial character of the waterfront neighborhood into a mixed-use enclave. What used to be common practices for the existing manufacturing and trucking businesses are now regarded as intolerable by residents, some of whom have started organized campaigns against the businesses. 
 They complain about noise coming from inside the ruddy red-brick walls of the squat warehouses, and pollution emitted by idling trucks. "In the beginning, nobody bothered us," said Archie Blandford, the owner of Blandford Construction, which has been in Red Hook for 10 years. "Now they have started a petition to get me removed."
Many light manufacturers said residents might drive them out by rezoning efforts or harassment. "Every time you make a noise around here, someone is calling a city agency to stop you," said Fred Marckesano, owner of Harbor Side Truck Repair. "It would be better to turn it all commercial and let the residents go through attrition."
Business leaders contend that the fight was formalized last year when residents proposed, and the community board approved, a zoning plan to restrict the commercial sector by making more housing available. The City Planning Commission asked Community Board 6 to revise the plan after business representatives complained at a public hearing.
The plan was started in 1993 under provision 197-a of the 1989 City Charter, authorizing communities to map their own future, and Red Hook became the first to make such a large-scale plan. There was, however, no business representative on the rezoning steering committee.
Frustrated residents said developers had been consulted during the planning and only recently voiced opposition to the proposal. Residents have stopped another plan by business leaders, the creation of a business improvement district.
"They used this BID to try to take over the community," said Susan Peebles, a resident involved in the rezoning. Ms. Peebles said that businesses were welcome, since they kept the area safe during the day, but that many buildings would stay empty unless they could be converted into housing. "You walk around here and say, 'Where are the businesses?' " she said.
Lisa Tennyson, a community development director for the South Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation, says there are more than 300 businesses in Red Hook employing at least 3,000 people. "Buildings look vacant but many aren't," she said. "A lot don't advertise themselves because they don't want to advertise what they have inside."
Still, business operators said they were considering leaving because whatever plan moves ahead, an industrial work environment is inherently inhospitable to residents. "Would you stay where you aren't wanted?" asked Mike DiPierri, the owner of R & S Trucking. "I'll end up moving to New Jersey. Who needs the aggravation?" MARK FRANCIS COHEN

Bakery Stays In Jamaica

BYLINE: By Mark Francis Cohen 

 BODY:
The future of the Continental Baking plant and its 450 employees was imperiled last July when Interstate Bakeries Corporation took over the South Jamaica company and decided it had one too many baking facilities in the Northeast.
But because of lobbying by the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, officials at Interstate decided instead to close its East Brunswick, N.J., bakery and expand operations at the Jamaica plant, creating 100 more jobs. 
 "It is a significant victory to retain them and to see them expand," said Carlisle Towery, the president of the nonprofit development corporation. "This is particularly delightful since New York is losing manufacturing."
Interstate's South Jamaica plant bakes and distributes Hostess and Wonder Bread products for the New York region. Company officials said they plan to invest $8 million into the plant at 168-23 Douglas Avenue to start producing a new line of rolls. In return, Interstate, the largest wholesale baking corporation in the country, will get at least $2 million in tax credits, because the Jamaica plant is in a state economic development zone.
Mr. Towery said he quickly approached the company, arguing that it should keep the plant running in Jamaica because of its proximity to Long Island, the two New York airports and a labor pool accustomed to working in food industries.
City officials also lobbied the company and said they were pleased that it decided to stay in Jamaica.
"Are you kidding me, 440 jobs?" said Rudy Washington, the commissioner of the city's Department of Business Services. "There was no way were going to let them go." MARK FRANCIS COHEN

 BODY:
IS a recession coming? How much will the Fed ease, and what will that do for the stock and bond markets? During a week in which the Fed cut short-term interest rates a bit, and which ended with a surprisingly weak employment report, we put the questions to three leading Wall Street economists -- Stephen S. Roach of Morgan Stanley; Philip Braverman of DKB Securities, a part of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan, and Robert J. Barbera of Capital Investments International. We found big disputes on the past as well as the future, with one panel member saying workers were going to start scoring big wage gains and another arguing that workers had not done that badly in recent years, whatever the statistics say.
 
Q. The European economy seems to be weak. Christmas sales were atrocious in this country. Is there a danger that we're going to have an election-year recession?
ROACH I don't think so. The fears of recession are overblown. I think we're in a long business cycle expansion. I just got back from Europe, and it's weak but it's not falling out of bed. The core of Europe counts for about 14 percent of global G.D.P. The other 86 percent is growing -- it's not booming. Christmas was weak in the U.S., if you talk to the department stores and the specialty retailers. But if you talk to a broad array of other industries that deal in consumer-sensitive demands ranging from home electronics to airlines, business was O.K. This is certainly not a boom, but it's not a bust. And I'm just a believer that expansions do not die a natural death. In the end they are murdered by the Fed, and the Fed is not holding the gun.
BARBERA I agree that expansions don't die a natural death. The Fed murders them. Sometimes, though, I think it's an inadvertent event. In the current environment, you can make the case that the Fed is very tight. The Fed doubled short rates in 1994 and has really given very little of that back.
 
Q. So it's involuntary manslaughter?
BARBERA Well, Alan Greenspan has erred before. To err is human. And to err twice is to run the Fed, I guess. The risk is that the Fed is too tight. I don't think we'll have a recession because I expect more aggressive Fed easing.
BRAVERMAN It's a tough call. We've moved to a disinflationary environment in which business is shifting production to lower-cost labor pools. Consumers have a sense of distrust for the future that they haven't previously experienced. They have very little in the way of income growth in real terms. The consumer, who represents two-thirds of the U.S. economy, is at least holding back, restraining spending. Things are going to be even tougher in 1996, particularly in the first half. We have too much inventory. Consumers are cutting back their spending. We have a decline in mortgage rates, but housing is not improving. We have huge excess capacity, not only here but around the world. So I see one of the mainstays of the expansion thus far, capital investment, slowing up. I see Government cutting back its spending.
Is the economy vulnerable to recession? Yes. Will it actually go into it? It's a tough call, but I think the economy will slow to the extent that we will move to the brink of recession. My view is that in the first half of this year we'll have G.D.P. growth of only about half a percent.
The consumer has increased borrowing as an end run around the absence of income growth. But it appears that option is being foreclosed to a considerable extent.
 
Q. The option is being foreclosed? I still get plenty of offers for new credit cards.
BRAVERMAN I know. But we have an increase in delinquency rates on installment credit and on mortgages. We're beginning to see a rise in consumer bankruptcies. And in the last Fed survey of bank lending patterns there was, for the first time, an indication that they are beginning to be shy about lending to consumers. So there's a combination of factors that have already reduced the pace of borrowing.
ROACH I've got to jump in. This notion that consumers are over extended is overblown. I think we're early in the debt cycle, not late in the debt cycle. The way you measure the burden of leverage on borrowers is not by the volume of debt they have outstanding. You don't pay off your credit card balance each month out of your current income flow. You pay the interest expenses associated with that. Mortgage and installment credit combined are well below the highs of the second half of the 1980's. Consumers are not at the brink.
These are tough times in terms of job and income security, but the system is generating enough in the way of purchasing power growth to enable consumers to deliver a reasonable rate of rise in spending. And I don't share the notion that there's weakness everywhere, either. I think that our export sector, capital spending sector and the housing sector will be reasonably firm in 1996.
BARBERA I think that Steve is right, that it is debt burden, not debt levels that matter. But obviously you affect debt burdens when you change short-term interest rates. And you did have a doubling of short-term interest rates in 1994. It's critically important to provide substantial rate relief to lower those debt burdens and allow consumers to return to putting more of their cash into purchases rather than into debt service.
 
Q. There's another way that consumers can get money besides borrowing it. It's called earning it. The statistics on real income growth have looked bad for years. Will that change soon?
ROACH Yes. We have gone too far in squeezing the worker to boost corporate profitability and competitiveness. I just came back from Asia, where a third of the world is perceived to be toiling for a bowl of rice for a day's wage, and therefore no wage increase is ever going to take place in this environment. But the relatively unskilled, undertrained, inexperienced Chinese worker does not compete with the machinist at Boeing who just successfully held out for a significant increase in real wages for the first time in several years. I think we're going to see more of that in the U.S. economy because pay rates over the past five years have now been squeezed so that they are running below the productivity curve and economic theory suggests that workers should be paid their marginal productivity contribution.
At a time when everybody is cracking out the champagne and celebrating the death of inflation, which is truly the view in the financial markets right now, I think we're going to be surprised that labor may have the final say on that in the years ahead.
BARBERA But your point is that they should get, at a minimum, the wage increase that allows them to benefit from their productivity contribution, which wouldn't generate any inflation.
ROACH If in fact wages were equal to productivity, then real labor cost growth would stay forever at zero. But wages have now gone so far below the productivity curve, I think the risk is, in a fully employed labor market, and, in my view, of an expanding global economy, that we're going to get into a period where wages move back above the productivity curve for a while for some of our more skilled irreplaceable occupations and that will bring the long-dormant wage cycle back to life at a time when no one thinks it can happen.
BARBERA That begs another question, which is where we are in terms of the domestic employment situation. Over the past 12 months we had a substantial slowing in employment growth but no change in the unemployment rate until the January jump we just saw, because there was less participation in the labor force. I find that too convenient to sound right. We saw precisely the same thing in 1989: a sharp slowing in household employment, sharp slowing in labor force participation and no apparent rise in the unemployment rate. There's substantially more slack in the economy today than there was 12 months ago, a consequence of a material slowdown in employment growth, even if you look at January's plunge with a jaundiced eye. Some increase in wages is a very legitimate event in light of the productivity gains that we've seen. But I don't see any rampant wage-generated inflation pressures because a year-plus of very slow growth has, as I see it, raised the de facto slack in the U.S. labor market.
 
Q. Phil, can I hope for a raise?
BRAVERMAN Well, you can hope. But that's about the extent of it. We happen to be somewhere in the middle on labor costs. The Germans are at the top end of the range with probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $23 to $26 an hour. The Japanese are close to $20, Americans, $17 an hour. And the Chinese, 54 cents. Now in between there are a lot of efficient, skilled workers available at $5 an hour in Hong Kong and Korea and Taiwan.
But it is inevitable that Americans, who are competing not only with the Japanese and Germans and are in a favorable position relative to that competition, but an unfavorable position relative to most of the rest of the world, are running nervous and scared and are literally losing jobs as production and services gradually shift away. Yes, we are gaining to some extent from Japanese and German companies. But the general sense of insecurity that is taking place in the hearts and minds of most American workers is a key element in causing this slowdown in spending. It's not, in a recession, the people who are unemployed that cause the reduction in spending as much as it is the people who are employed who fear they may become unemployed that call a halt to the postponable spending. And that's what we're beginning to see now.
BARBERA There is also the issue of what's going on with real wages in the U.S. I have become one of the proponents of the notion that the Consumer Price Index is overstated and that it's gotten substantially worse over the last 10 years. If you believe that a consequence of the big move into high-technology equipment, a big move toward quality improvements rather than quantity, is to substantially overstate the C.P.I. . . .
ROACH How much? Give us a ball park.
BARBERA Leonard Nakamura at the Philly Fed thinks that it's about 2 1/2 to 3 percent.
ROACH A year?
BARBERA At present you essentially have more than a hundred percent of the measured inflation as measurement error.
ROACH So we've been in a period of deflation for how long?
BARBERA He would say that we're right now slightly in deflation.
ROACH Do you actually believe that?
BARBERA I think that inflation is overstated by two percentage points. Do you actually believe that there's been no contribution from technological improvement over the last 15 years?
ROACH I think the technological contribution has just started to click in. To just surmise that we have been riding the crest of this wonderful information age for 15 to 20 years and the productivity benefits have been accruing for all of us for the entire period is wrong.
BARBERA Look at medical care, for instance. Look at the extraordinary advances that have gone on in medical technology, and you realize that all of those advances are measured as inflation. It appears, according to official Government data, that we're spending more and more and more for less medical care due to the methodology that the C.P.I. uses. The reason I bring it up is it's interesting that there has not been any substantial and dramatic saber rattling within the labor markets despite what appears in the official data to be a devastation of real wages. I would submit that's because inflation is overstated significantly and real wages have been rising at about the trend rate that you saw in the previous period.
ROACH I would submit, to the contrary, that Bill Clinton was elected in 1992 under the campaign credo of putting people first and that there is a strong sense of malaise and concern over stagnant real wages in the United States. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has just elected the most militant leader in about 40 years, John Sweeney.
Let's look at a few other facts that I think really underscore the fact that this system is not delivering as we thought it should. The widening of the inequalities of income distribution in the 1990's is without precedent in the post-World War II history of the U.S. economy. The share of national income going to the owners of capital through corporate profits is surging. The share going to compensation is falling. This is not the way a democracy is supposed to work. This is not the way our free-enterprise capital system is supposed to allocate its income. So, a very small slice of America is benefiting from the competitive revival and the new-found prosperity. I think the second half of the 1990's is going to be about shifting the benefits of this productivity recovery to the workers who have made the contribution, and so I think we're going to see more in the way of real wage increases going forward than we have seen in the past decade.
BRAVERMAN The problem is that most economists continue to view the U.S. economy the way they had when we were less exposed to an international competitive threat. We are now part of a global economy. We don't have the control, labor doesn't have the control, management doesn't have the control. The U.S. Government doesn't have the control. We are an open society. Not as much as we may be in some period ahead, but far more than we have been. Over a billion workers have been added to the labor force of the world.
ROACH But what do they do? I mean, do these workers have the same skill set that, say, a machinist does who's assembling aircraft for Boeing? Do the Chinese really compete with Boeing's machinists?
BRAVERMAN You use one of the few areas where the United States or a U.S. company has five years' worth of orders and is one of the premiere producers. Those workers producing for that particular company, in a particular industry, yes, still have a fair amount of clout. But you can't use that, what I view as a pretty isolated case, as a demonstration for the U.S.
ROACH I'll tell you why I can. The process of corporate restructuring, which has been under way since the mid-1980's, is aimed at producing exactly the type of example that we're seeing in Boeing. Boeing is a byproduct of a successful restructuring. And company after company has followed the same model. They're left with a core of workers that they need to deliver into their expanding global marketplace. And they have to pay those workers what those, that core of their workers, are contributing. And that's why management elected to pay the machinists a real wage increase at Boeing for the first time in several years. I think you're going to see more of that down the road.
BRAVERMAN There are spots here and there where highly skilled workers are in relatively short supply in business. But the essence of business is to operate as lean as it possibly can. Companies don't have the ability to pass price increases through. And because they don't have that ability, they are downsizing, outsourcing and cutting fringe benefits and shifting production outside the U.S., if that's efficient. So the employees are more nervous. And because they're more nervous, not experiencing the income growth or the job security, they are holding back on their spending. That makes them very price sensitive. And that creates a virtuous inflation circle.
 
Q. I'm not sure workers find it that virtuous.
BRAVERMAN Well, it's virtuous from the point of view of inflation being an evil. But this deflation can also be an evil.
BARBERA The single best measure indicating that downsizing has only benefited the corporate sector is that real wages have gone nowhere for 15 years. But my contention is that the C.P.I. is meaningfully overstated and therefore the real wage numbers have been substantially better, which means that downsizing is what it was supposed to be in the textbooks -- bad for you in the short run, because you lose your job, good for you in the intermediate term because productivity goes up and real wages go up and living standards go up. Now there is a shift, no question, from wages to profits in terms of share of income. However, we had an extraordinary decline in profits from 1966 to 1982, and we're about two-thirds of the way back to where we were in 1966.
 
Q. Let me ask about a different kind of prices, bond prices. Should I buy bonds?
BRAVERMAN Yes, definitely. I think most of the economic statistics overstate the health of the U.S. economy and overstate inflation. I would say that we are already seeing a C.P.I., if it were properly measured, somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 percent. If you take historical norms over the last 200 years, when inflation wasn't running up the way it did in the 70's and 80's, we only got to current levels of bond yields in the midst of war, and a wartime inflationary environment, or in financial panics. Right now, we are talking about Treasury bond yields at 6 percent, substantially above the median of 4 1/4 percent of that 200-year experience. And if you take the historical relationships to inflation . . .
ROACH What was the average budget deficit share of G.D.P. over the 200-year period?
BRAVERMAN Well, we were running budget deficits in the Civil War, in the War of 1812 and we still got bond yields of only 6 percent, where we are now.
 
Q. Most of that time we also had the dollar anchored to the price of gold.
BRAVERMAN There is no doubt that there were some unique advantages. But inflation, I look to be this year in the neighborhood of 2, 2 1/2 percent. Historical norm would suggest something in the neighborhood of 2 1/2 to at most 3 percent for the real rate, which would give you a 5 to 5 1/2 percent bond yield range this year. So, potentially, a full percentage point under current levels.
ROACH I think that there is one more leg to this rally in bonds as long as the Fed is perceived to be in a fairly aggressive easing mode, as is the case right now. I think that bond yields will fall lower, possibly down to 5 1/2 percent near term. But I would argue that that rally will be short-lived. And that investors should sell into that rally because I think the markets are just too bulled up on the notion that the economy is going to flirt with recession and that inflation is dead and that meaningful deficit reduction is at hand. In all three of those counts the markets are going to end up being disappointed. I see bond yields moving back toward 7 percent in the second half of this year.
BARBERA I'm quite concerned because our bond market bear has them at 5 1/2 percent near term. That gives me pause. The best friend that the bond had, in the second half of last year, was the Fed, which dragged its feet and extended this period of economic weakness. I believe the Fed is going to be a lot more aggressive in its easing in the first half of this year, and as a consequence, I think there's a lot less to the bond rally in the first half of this year than there was in the second half of last. Dare I mention stocks?
 
Q. I haven't heard a number on bonds yet.
BARBERA I'd say, maybe we'll get to 5 3/4 percent on the long bond. In the second half you'll probably have rising rates. Likewise in the equity market in the second half of last year, economically sensitive stocks had a disastrous relative performance. The rise for the stock market masked a sharp signal of cyclical deterioration. I would think with a more aggressive Fed, that trend reverses and in the first half of this year, economically sensitive stocks do substantially better.
 
Q. And the overall market?
BARBERA Modestly up.
 
Q. Anyone else care to forecast stocks?
ROACH We've been bullish on the stock market at Morgan Stanley for about four years, and my colleague Byron Wien is of the view that we've got one more leg to go in this stock rally. But he shares my view that a rise in long-term interest rates, which will occur in the second half of this year, is a distinct negative for stocks. We look for a sharp correction, in excess of 20 percent, in the second half of 1996.
BRAVERMAN Since I think the economy will slow and corporate earnings with it, even though I look for a very substantial decline in interest rates, which has been a positive for stocks, I think that by July the stock market will be hurt by failing expectations for earnings. That will cause a retrenchment in equities, perhaps 5 to 10 percent.
 
Q. The Federal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, was cut to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent last week. How low will it go?
BRAVERMAN I look for the Fed to reduce it to 4 1/2 percent before Labor Day and to cut it further after the election.
ROACH I think the Fed is not going to cut the funds rate even close to what Phil indicated and not as much as what the bond market is clearly expecting. If the economy does O.K. and if wage trends continue to tick up as they have been doing over the last 24 months and if the global economy comes out of this mid-cycle pause, I think the Fed will actually shock the markets by contemplating a tightening in the second half of this year.
BARBERA I guess it comes down to whether you think the U.S. economy in 1995 slowed as a consequence of monetary policy. My sense is a doubling of short rates from 3 to 6 percent on Fed funds is the reason you had a sharp slowing in everything you can measure in the U.S. economy in 1995. And then you've got to erase about half of that to put you back on a firmer trend for real economic growth. So 3 to 6 to slow it down; 6 to 4 1/2 to rev it up some.
 
Q. Thanks. I'm absolutely confident you're not all right.

Madison Ave.: Ever Chichi, Soon Safer

BYLINE: By Bruce Lambert 

 BODY:
Madison Avenue ranks among the world's premier shopping streets. Fashionable and famous emporiums like Polo, Armani and Barneys draw the rich and the recognized, as do the avenue's art galleries and restaurants. Rents for retail space are in league with those for stores on Fifth Avenue, 57th Street and the Ginza in Tokyo.
But two years ago the shooting of two customers in a robbery at the exclusive Vera Wang bridal salon, at 77th Street, shocked merchants, moving them to form a business improvement district, the first large one approved by the Council after it lifted a moratorium on new districts so it could study abuses at existing ones and recommend changes. "It is sorely needed to maintain the area's position," said the head of the Madison Avenue Merchants Association, Alexander Kabbaz, who is expected to head the new district when it starts operating in September. 
 Violent crime remains rare on Madison Avenue, so the district's planned 17-member security force will focus on deterring purse snatchings, pickpocketing, shopping-bag theft, car theft, burglaries and shoplifting.
"We're hoping this will make the shopping district more attractive, giving back the services the city used to give us 20 years ago," said Michael Goodrich, owner of Spectra electronics, near 65th Street. And Murray Shapiro, vice president of Zitomer, a pharmacy and specialty store between 75th and 76th Streets, says he is certain the district will make the avenue "cleaner, safer, more visible, more inviting -- and more profitable -- if that's not too gauche to say."

HEADLINE: MINDING YOUR BUSINESS;
Here's a Way to Diversify, With Training Wheels

BYLINE: By LAURA PEDERSEN 

DATELINE: New Canaan, Conn.

 BODY:

Q. I've been hearing a lot about so-called life-style funds that are supposedly well-suited to retirement planning. Are they worth investigating? ALIZANNE FORRESTER 

A. They may be, especially if you're among the millions of United States workers who plan to live off their 401(k) plans after retiring. When you add up your projected expenses and take inflation into account, you may find that the amount you've salted away so far is barely enough to season a large order of french fries.
Not saving enough, of course, is part of the problem. But another big reason is that two-thirds of all 401(k) money is tied up in fixed-income instruments like bonds, money market accounts and guaranteed investment contracts -- safe, yes, but hardly big moneymakers. Once you stop working, you'll probably need a lot more than the payout from a 401(k) loaded with such conservative choices if you want to maintain your current life style.
This nettlesome problem can be addressed with a financial tuneup. For some people, particularly those who don't want to be bothered with financial planning and sophisticated investment choices, life-style funds may offer a limited solution. Also called life-cycle funds, lifepath funds or theme funds, these portfolios are usually well-diversified and specifically matched to an investor's age group, risk tolerance, financial objectives and time horizon.
The idea is simple: different blends of investments for different stages of life. It's basically the same concept as cycle dog food, only for investors, not canines.
Life-style funds put your money to work in more than one type of asset -- stocks and bonds, mostly. The mix is weighted toward stocks for younger and more risk-tolerant investors and toward bonds for older, more conservative ones. Other investors can choose a fund equally divided between stocks and bonds. Some funds gradually shift toward safer, fixed-income securities based on your age or the fund's target date.
The three Time Horizon funds from BankAmerica are intended for people with 10, 20 or 30 years to invest. Others, like Putnam's Lifestage funds, come in growth, balanced and conservative versions so you make your choice based on your risk level rather than simply on your age.
A life-style fund is perhaps best suited for aging baby boomers looking to save for retirement. By putting these investors at least partly into stocks, a life-style fund offers the prospect of healthier returns than could be squeezed from an all-bond portfolio, while the fund's fixed-income component provides a cushion against market volatility. The fund managers also do all the thinking, watch the markets and make the picks -- for a management fee similar to what most any fund would charge. For a novice investor, that can be an advantage.
"The industry is offering what it should have sold all along: an actively managed product targeted toward a time line," said Geoffrey Bobroff, a financial services consultant in East Greenwich, R.I. He predicted that life-style funds would make up as much as a quarter of the equity fund exposure in 401(k) plans within five years.
Much of that growth, if it materializes, will come from inexperienced investors fretting about rock-bottom interest rates on bank certificates of deposit.
Though nervous about gambling, neophytes are often equally concerned that their play-it-safe mentality may keep them from realizing adequate returns. A life-style fund can help them take the plunge -- or at least wade in up to their knees. According to J. Carter Beese Jr., a former member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, life-style funds teach participants the merits of allocating money to different asset classes. "They realize that this is an ongoing process and that there's a difference between saving and investing," Mr. Beese said.
Before investing in a life-style fund, you might keep a few things in mind.
For starters, the funds are too new to have established a meaningful track record, though initial overall performance has been less than stellar. Nor does their mix-and-match approach to investing make it easy to compare them with other funds, or even with one another.
Moreover, for all the talk about matching plans to people, life-style portfolios often reflect a one-size-fits-most approach that can do more harm than good.
Some skeptics question the funds' underlying assumption that the older you are, the more you should tilt toward bonds and away from stocks. Age and risk intolerance are not always synonymous, said Gary Lineberry, vice president of Met Life's defined-contribution group. One 50-year-old investor, for example, may have a substantial retirement account after doing a lot of planning and saving. But another investor of the same age may have accumulated far less because of many job changes and may be eager to make up for lost opportunities in a shorter time.
In addition, some people think it's not such a good idea to relinquish control of your assets to a fund manager. You may be spared the trouble of making your own picks, but you also give up much freedom and flexibility. As long as you're taking the trouble to shop for a life-style fund, this argument goes, you could spend a bit more time to construct a portfolio that is better suited to your needs.
For people who are already comfortable managing their own investments, a life-style fund will seem about as necessary as asking a flight attendant to direct them to seat 4A on a 737. But for novices, it may be a sensible way to make a first venture into the stock market.

HEADLINE: Anarchy in America?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (column, Jan. 28) suggests that Africa is "a freshman Republican's paradise" because there are no taxpayers to finance a welfare state: that "in Rwanda and Burundi, no one is asked to pay for Head Start," and that, instead, the Tutsi and the Hutu revert to genocide "to grab more resources." 
 Does Mr. Friedman really believe that 8 percent increases in Medicare spending mean civilization in America but that 4 percent increases foretell barbarism?
Does a free-market economy suppose anarchy?
The United States, as Mr. Friedman observes, is a special place. His commentary helps shred that something special to which we are all devoted.

HEADLINE: Remember 1987 Peak? It's Nearly Doubled

 BODY:
It was during a period of speculative frenzy that the Dow Jones industrial average hit a record of 2,722.42 on a summer day in 1987. Within a few months, after share prices crashed, money managers could be heard muttering they would never again let valuations grow so excessive.
Now, eight and a half years later, the Dow is on the verge of doubling that figure, having topped 5,400 on Thursday. Investors who held on after the crash have long since felt vindicated. Those who bought after the crash are even happier. The Dow is more than three times as high as it was then. 
 Have those gains exceeded rationality, as happened in the summer of 1987? Certainly there has been plenty of good news: Interest rates are down and corporate profits are up. But stock market valuation measures are strained, at best, even though Wall Street has lots of reasons why they don't matter.
In 1987, as shares moved to dizzying heights, there was talk that the bull market could not end quickly, because everyone knew that in the final blowout phase, it is the small speculative stocks that go up the most. And small stocks were lagging badly, as they are now. The Dow was up 3.5 percent last month; the Russell 2,000 index was down a bit.
What happened then, and appears to be happening now, says Steve Leuthold, the Minneapolis value maven, is capitulation by cautious money managers. They are investing the cash they had accumulated, fearing that otherwise they will be left in the performance-derby dust if share prices keep rising. The amount of uninvested cash in mutual funds devoted to American stocks jumped 23 percent, or $15.4 billion, in the final quarter of 1995. Now it is being spent.
When such a buying panic hits, the fastest way to get money to work is to buy stock index futures, which are also nice if you can't find any particular stocks worth buying. Through the magic of program trading and index arbitrage, that buying gets translated into the purchase of big stocks, which then become the best performers.
Mutual fund investing may make it easier to ignore valuation measures. The buyer is looking for past performance, not current fundamentals. Studying those is the job of the manager running the fund. And most of those managers figure that it is their job to invest the money given to them, not to let cash pile up for long.
Mr. Leuthold is an exception. He figures the market is about 5 percent more overvalued now than it was at the 1987 peak, but he has started a mutual fund anyway. The Leuthold Asset Allocation Fund has less than a quarter of its assets in stocks, with the rest in cash and bonds. Its performance will be pitiful if the bull keeps raging.
When will this end? Not until the money stops pouring into the market. The demographic factors are clearly bullish, with retirement worries prompting more and more baby boomers to invest. And with bond yields down and savings accounts paying little, the stock market can look like the only hope for good returns.
Worries about recession traditionally kill bull markets. But in 1990, the stock market did not turn down until the recession had begun, rather than months before. Now there is great faith that the Federal Reserve will do just the right thing to keep the economy growing for many years to come, so no recession is likely. Could the stock market be surprised again?
At these valuation levels, such a surprise could be very painful.

HEADLINE: Neighborhood Report;
Troubled Haven, Now Bankrupt, Still Fighting to Survive

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
In 1972, Joyce Hartwell set up a school on Avenue B to teach carpentry and plumbing to inner-city women. Today, Ms. Hartwell's Lady Carpenter institute has expanded into the All-Craft Center, a sprawling complex of buildings on St. Marks Place offering social services that help, among others, abused children, recovering drug addicts and former prison inmates with AIDS.
But over the years, government officials have criticized All-Craft for sloppy record-keeping, and nearby residents have complained that center clients clog sidewalks and disturb neighbors with late-night noise. 
 Now, after serving thousands of clients in crisis, Ms. Hartwell is facing one of her own: a financial one. Saddled with over $1 million in debt, Ms. Hartwell, 57, nearly lost her buildings last month at a city auction because one of her creditors won a judgment against her organization. Ms. Hartwell was able to stave off the sale at the last minute by filing for bankruptcy protection.
While she may have bought a reprieve, Ms. Hartwell is still trying to keep her agency afloat with her only remaining income source, the $80,000 a year she says is collected from renting out space in her hulking collection of buildings that stretch from 19 to 25 St. Marks Place, between Second and Third Avenues. All-Craft now gets by without a paid staff, and Ms. Hartwell scrimps for light bulbs and toilet paper.
Her buildings are in desperate need of repair: last June, a Civil Court judge sentenced her to 30 days on Rikers Island for neglecting her property. And three tenants she inherited when All-Craft bought the buildings in 1978 stopped paying rent a decade ago to protest what they say are a lack of basic services.
Despite these troubles, Ms. Hartwell is pressing forward with ideas to bring All-Craft to solvency. With the help of an unidentified investment banker, Ms. Hartwell, an interfaith minister, says she will establish a coffee house and a New Age cabaret on the ground floor.
"There are some people who only want us to fail," she said last week, "but if they give us a chance, our businesses will bring enormous economic benefit to the entire neighborhood."
An imposing woman who dresses in flowing black frocks and a clerical collar, Ms. Hartwell faces a chorus of neighborhood critics who call the All-Craft Center is a blight on St. Marks Place.
"All we want is a good neighbor, but every time you try talking to Joyce, she gets defensive and says you're trying to get rid of her," said Kate Walter, chairwoman of the local block association.
Ms. Hartwell dismisses such complaints as racist. "I think people are just afraid because our clients are mostly minority," she said.
Over the years, the government money that kept All-Craft afloat dried up, because of budget cuts or because she failed to maintain the records that agencies require.
"Ms. Hartwell is a people person, not a paper person," said Dan McGill of the state's Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse, which stopped funds for All-Craft in 1993 because of budget constraints and concerns about its fiscal viability.
For the 10 youths and 18 recovering addicts from all parts of the city who live at All-Craft, Ms. Hartwell's money problems are worrisome. Fleeing an abusive father, Nelson Carrion, 19, has lived at the center since he was 10.
"If this place wasn't here, we'd be on the street or in jail," he said. "Joyce keeps us out of trouble." ANDREW JACOBS

HEADLINE: The Magellan Fund Enters Its Next Phase: Cyclical Stocks

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
AMID all the market fascination about whether the Fidelity Magellan fund is buying or selling technology stocks, it's easy to forget that the $54 billion behemoth has anything else in its portfolio.
But by its most recent tally, the Magellan fund had holdings of cyclical stocks -- those of construction companies, manufacturers of industrial machinery and makers of durable goods like textiles, home furnishings and automobiles -- totaling nearly 24 percent of assets, only slightly less than the fund's technology stake. That was at the end of November, and in the last two months of 1995, the fund added substantially to some cyclical stocks, according to regulatory filings. Along the way, it may well have trimmed its technology position even further. 
 So everyone interested in what sector will replace technology as the favorite of Jeffrey N. Vinik, who has made some big sector bets as the manager of Magellan and of previous funds, will want to take a close look at the cyclicals. While some managers fleeing the technology stocks have been turning to drug companies and financial companies -- both of which have had a good run already -- Magellan seems to be leaning toward a basic bet on a strengthening economy. And because it is the nation's largest mutual fund, its moves are closely watched -- and sometimes considered a market indicator.
For many months, Mr. Vinik has sung the praises of the cyclicals, which rise and fall with the economy. Caterpillar, for instance, the tractor and heavy-equipment maker, has been among the fund's top 10 holdings for more than six months.
Back in June, before Fidelity Investments muzzled its mutual fund managers, Mr. Vinik predicted in a speech in New York that the outlook for Caterpillar and similar stocks was particularly good because, he believed, the Federal Reserve would lower short-term interest rates "very soon and very rapidly over the next several months."
While his timing was a bit off, Mr. Vinik's thesis was essentially correct: Weakness in the domestic economy would lead the central bank to ease the access to cash. Last week, the Federal Reserve lowered two key short-term interest rates, the second round of rate cuts in less than two months.
Next week, Fidelity will disclose Magellan's asset allocation at the end of 1995, but some of the fund's recent moves can already be discerned from filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the last two months of 1995, Magellan greatly increased its holdings of several cyclical companies, including the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation, inventor of the familiar pink insulation material used in home construction; A. Schulman Inc., a maker of plastic compounds sold to the auto, electronics and agricultural industries; the Sherwin-Williams Company, a paint manufacturer; and Shaw Industries, one of the country's largest carpet makers.
Also showing up on Mr. Vinik's "buy" list was Trinity Industries, a manufacturer of rail cars, metal containers, highway guardrails and other metal products.
In each case, Magellan sharply increased its holdings since the end of September, when the fund disclosed its full portfolio in its twice-a-year report to shareholders. While the holdings in each of the five companies represent a small portion of the total assets of the Magellan fund, they account for 5.8 percent to 7.8 percent of the individual companies' total shares.
To be sure, cyclicals do not account for nearly as large a portion of the fund as technology stocks did a year ago, nor have they drastically risen in the portfolio over the last year. Still, the buying provides a glimpse of what may be to come.
Mr. Vinik declined to be interviewed for this article, and Fidelity has gone out of its way in recent months to emphasize that its managers' comments reflect thinking only at the time they are made, and that their opinions are subject to rapid change.
But the most recent documented trading activities of Mr. Vinik suggest that he still believes much of what he said last June: "As bullish as I am on technology, right now I think the best opportunity in the U.S. stock market is in cyclicals." At the time, 44 percent of the Magellan fund's assets were in technology stocks, a weighting maintained for nearly five more months, while nearly a quarter of the fund's assets were in cyclical industries.
Other Wall Street experts continue to agree, albeit cautiously, with Mr. Vinik's comments. Byron R. Wien, portfolio strategist at Morgan Stanley, said last week he believes the underlying strength of the economy "is greater than most people think," and that bodes well for cyclical stocks.
"The common view is that the more the Fed cuts, the better the environment is for cyclical stocks," Mr. Wien said. "The more reasoned view is that the economy won't grow fast enough to allow those companies to have surprisingly favorable earnings.
"I own a lot of these stocks," he continued, "but you have to be very selective. They may not do as well as they usually do as a series of Fed easings takes place."
When presented with Mr. Vinik's apparent affinity for cyclical issues, Mr. Wien said his sentiment is similar, with a particular emphasis on paper and housing stocks. "I'm there, but I'm a little nervous about it," he conceded.
Mr. Vinik's latest cyclical bets have generally fared well, with four of the five stocks gaining ground from mid-December through the end of last week. Trinity Industries, for example, rose from about $30 a share six weeks ago to close at $35 last week; Sherwin-Williams closed at a new 52-week high of $42.50 on Friday, up from about $39 in mid-December.
Less profitable has been the Magellan fund's bet on Shaw, the carpet maker, whose stock price has declined in the last month as the company terminated a plan to acquire the Maxim Group, a rival floor-coverings company, and last week, Home Depot discontinued selling Shaw's products. Shaw said that it expects that action to have minimal impact on its sales, less than half of 1 percent of which went to Home Depot.
Caterpillar stock, which at the end of November was the fund's second-largest equity holding, has experienced big swings, trading above $75 in July and below $51 in October. Most recently, the shares traded at about $63, slightly above the average for the six months ended in September, during which the Magellan fund doubled its holdings of Caterpillar stock to more than 14 million shares.
Whether Mr. Vinik remains bullish on cyclical stocks will become more apparent in coming weeks. Just as closely as some on Wall Street are watching Mr. Vinik, the celebrated fund manager is likely to have his eyes glued on the next meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making board, near the end of March.

Navigating 125th Street

BYLINE: By JANET ALLON 

 BODY:
DIAGONALLY opposite the burned-out shell of Freddy's clothing store, Barbara Askins, who heads the 125th Street Business Improvement District, is having a late lunch of okra and corn and oxtail stew and collard greens at Manna's Restaurant.
"Isn't it interesting that this is a Korean-owned deli with some black employees that serves soul food to a mixed but mostly black clientele?" Ms. Askins says as familiar faces drop by. Al Ward, the owner of the nearby Baskin-Robbins franchise, rails about non-black merchants on 125th Street who don't give anything back to the neighborhood. "That's what Minister Farrakhan means by 'bloodsuckers,' " he says. "People should be forced to give back." 
 When Ms. Askins, 44, hears that blacks are underrepresented on 125th -- and she hears it often -- she wants to make sure she has the straight story. She walks the street pointing out that in nearly every store there is at least one black employee. "A lot of people repeat these things," she says. "I think it's important to get the facts."
For instance, she says that although blacks own barely half the storefront businesses, more than half of the assessed property value in the BID is black-owned.
It is middle-of-the-road positions like these that have sometimes landed Ms. Askins in hot water in Harlem. She has been called a sellout and an outsider, although she has lived in Harlem for 10 years. A Louisiana native, she once planned a career in fashion, but wound up as a temporary worker for a consultant who explained public projects to the public. That job sparked her interest in economic development.
In 1989, the 125th Street Local Development Corporation hired Ms. Askins as its merchant liaison as the street was undergoing reconstruction. A year later, she started laying the groundwork for the BID, which began operations in October 1994.
Ms. Askins knew the merchants and what they wanted: to get vendors removed from the sidewalks. "There was congestion, unfair competition, disputes between vendors over space, parking problems, filth and noise," she said. "Merchants were getting summonsed for vendors' activities."
After an extensive search for an alternative site, the police swept the vendors away, leaving bitterness in their wake. But some have found success at a new market at 116th and Lenox Avenue. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who took up the vendors' cause, has measured words for Ms. Askins. "We have different visions," he said. "I respect that she has fought for businesses in Harlem, I just think that she should fight for street-level businesses as well."
Some of Ms. Askins's concerns are indistinguishable from those of the city's other BIDs. But Harlem's supercharged political atmosphere adds another dimension.
Walking along 125th, she talks to store owners about improving facades and signage. But the merchants talk about deeper problems: pervasive unemployment, cuts in welfare, shoppers who lack the economic confidence to buy, the lack of low-interest loans for minority-owned businesses.
What they need most, they say, are customers. The complain Harlem's status as a prime tourist attraction is bringing little economic benefit. "People need to come off of those tour buses and stop and shop," says Kevin McGill, who owns Men's Walker, a shoe store at Lenox Avenue. "Every damn half-hour they turn the corner."
More than the BID, the long-delayed $300 million empowerment zone, with its incentives for businesses, is intended to address the merchants' concerns. "The zone runs straight through 125th Street," says Ms. Askins. "We can't help but benefit."
She envisions 125th Street as a unique commercial strip with more opportunities for minorities, and with chain and anchor stores -- as well as small businesses -- to create and maintain foot traffic. And while she admits that chain stores drive up rents and perhaps diminish local flavor, she is convinced Harlem needs some to keep its considerable spending power at home.
Her critics fear the larger stores will destroy smaller merchants. Recently a group calling itself the Harlem Grassroots Coalition to Take Back the Hood marched on 125th Street protesting that chain stores squeeze out black-owned businesses.
The demonstration was an uncomfortable reminder of the Dec. 8 shootings and deadly fire at Freddy's, which overshadow any discussion of the retail mix along 125th Street. Ms. Askins knew there were tensions between the store owner, Fred A. Harari, and Sikhulu Shange, the owner of the Record Shack next door, whom Mr. Harari wanted to evict. She could watch the demonstrators and the police from her office. But she insists that it was a lease dispute, that "the BID does not get involved in lease disputes and that both parties said they were talking." She was out of town the day before the conflagration and returned to her office to see police officers running down the street.

HEADLINE: Terms of Engagement

BYLINE: By Strobe Talbott; Strobe Talbott is Deputy Secretary of State.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Over the past five years, the United States policy of steady engagement with Russia has paid benefits to the American people. With our help, the Russians have dismantled thousands of nuclear warheads and rocket launchers. Russian troops, having withdrawn from Germany and the Baltic states, are serving alongside their NATO counterparts in Bosnia. The United States is now the largest foreign investor in Russia, and bilateral trade has nearly tripled in the past three years.
When Secretary of State Warren Christopher meets with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov in Helsinki this week, he will stress America's determination to preserve and, where possible, to deepen and broaden these accomplishments. He will also discuss some issues on which we have differences, such as Russia's intention to sell nuclear reactors to Iran. 
 The meeting will take place against the backdrop of troubling trends, as Russia's June presidential election approaches. Communists and ultra-nationalists, tapping into fear of the future and nostalgia for the past, are riding high in the polls and in the Parliament. Democrats and centrists are divided. An embattled President Boris Yeltsin, poised to announce his campaign for re-election, has dismissed a number of prominent reformers.
Even when the direction of Russian politics is uncertain, the fundamentals of American policy remain clear and consistent. One is that we support democracy. It is not our responsibility to choose Russia's leaders. It never was. The Russian people now have the power to do that themselves.
We believe that the enfranchisement of Russian citizens will, if sustained, be good for their country and for the world. The impressive voter turnout in December's parliamentary elections suggests that the Russian people are getting used to choosing their leaders. The Russian media, through their coverage of the devastating use of force in Chechnya, have demonstrated that they cherish their new independence.
Freedom of choice and speech will help move Russia toward the rule of law and the consolidation of a civil society. As President Clinton has repeatedly stressed, democracies are more likely to be reliable partners in trade and diplomacy, and more likely to pursue foreign and defense policies that are compatible with United States interests.
We will advance those interests in the short term as well as the long by giving priority to three objectives:
Nuclear security. We will press for implementation of arms control agreements that enhance international security and reduce levels of lethal weaponry left over from the superpower rivalry. Now that the Senate has ratified Start II, President Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister Primakov have vowed to intensify their effort for ratification by the Parliament. Meanwhile, we will look for new ways to control dangerous fissile material and enhance the safety of reactors at a summit meeting in Moscow in April.
An undivided Europe. Russia has yet to comply fully with the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty. We are working hard with Russia and the other treaty signatories to resolve this problem so that it no longer casts a cloud over a broad range of mutually reinforcing European security arrangements. They include an expanding NATO-Russia relationship as NATO takes in new members; an enhanced role for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and increased practical cooperation between NATO and the former members of the Warsaw Pact, through the Partnership for Peace.
Peace and independence. Russia is stepping up its call for economic and political integration among the former Soviet republics. In Eurasia, as in other parts of the world, we oppose coercion and intimidation of neighboring states. We will endorse regional cooperation only so long as it is truly and totally voluntary and only if it opens doors to the outside world.
That sort of integration is our overarching aspiration for a democratic Russia and the other new independent states. It is in our interests -- and theirs -- that they join, as soon and as fully as possible, the growing community of market democracies. But the pace of their integration into the West will depend on the pace of their reforms and on their adherence to international norms.
These terms of engagement have undergirded Administration policy for the past three years. They have already furthered vital and enduring American interests. They will continue to serve the United States well in the suspenseful months -- and years -- ahead.

HEADLINE: Making Tax Cuts Work Is Harder Than It Sounds

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In a generally laudatory essay on State Treasurer Brian Clymer ("A Whitman Cabinet Star Explains It All for You," On Politics, Jan. 21), Iver Peterson made an incredible assertion. He said the Treasurer is a star in the Governor's Cabinet because "he made her tax cuts work." 
 The phrase is curious. While it may be correct to say the Treasurer helped make the tax cut a reality, he certainly has not made the tax cut work the way the Governor originally promised.
When she unveiled her plan during her 1993 race for governor, Mrs. Whitman said the tax cuts would produce 450,000 new jobs and cure all of the economic problems that had riddled the state during the 1990-91 recession. She promised to offset the tax cuts with reductions in state spending while not driving up property tax rates.
This plan was doomed to failure for many reasons (including lack of internal logic: she preaches the inability of government to spur economic growth, but her whole platform is based on the claim that the government can create prosperity by adjusting tax rates). But as any newspaper reader can see, Mrs. Whitman gave the public false hope. The state's unemployment rate for December was a whopping 7.3 percent, the second highest in the country. All indicators point to a worsening jobless picture because of the layoffs announced by AT&T last month.
In fact, the state income tax, which is small compared to Federal, property and sales taxes, is a minor factor in investment decisions. The major effect of the income tax cut has been to put money in the pockets of the wealthy. Under Mrs. Whitman's plan, people making $300,000 or more receive 10 times the tax cut of an average New Jersey family earning $50,000. According to a Treasury Department analysis, New Jersey's richest taxpayers, the 6.7 percent who make $100,000 or more, will pocket more than 40 percent of the savings from the full 30 percent income tax cut.
At the same time, the Whitman administration has failed to trim the state budget to make up for the loss of revenue from her tax cuts. Instead, she and Mr. Clymer have raided $2.4 billion from a state employee pension plan, and reduced state aid to municipalities. Now they want to raid the state's disability fund. The results are not savings but shifting tax burdens, to local property owners and future taxpayers.
Treasurer Clymer may have made Mrs. Whitman's tax cuts work for her -- she is said to be on the short list of Republican vice-presidential nominees -- but he certainly hasn't made them do much for the rest of us.

HEADLINE: Navy Facing Criticism In Toxic Dumping

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
THE Navy may be using contaminated spoil to cap 1.2 million cubic yards of toxic-laden material that it dumped into Long Island Sound near Fishers Island, opponents of the project charge.
The dumping began in late 1994 and is to be completed early phis month. At issue is the material -- the spoils -- taken from dredging the heavily industrialized Thames River at New London to provide clearance for the Seawolf nuclear submarine at her home port. 
 The opponents, led by the Fishers Island Conservancy, said recent tests that they paid for had showed moderate levels of mercury, traces of dioxin and small amounts of other toxic substances in samples of the capping material used to cover the spoils.
They said the results should compel further tests by the Navy before the capping is allowed to continue.
"Any capping material that goes out there should be very clean," the president of the conservancy, John H. Thatcher Jr., said. "This should raise a red flag."
Mr Thatcher said if additional contamination was found officials should recap the dump site with material certified as clean.
The Navy official in charge of the project, Robert K. Ostermueller of the Navy Facilities Engineering Command in Lester, Pa., did not return three calls to his office.
But an assistant commissioner in the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, Arthur J. Rocque Jr., said the capping material was clean and met Federal and state standards for marine projects. Mr. Rocque said recapping would be unnecessary and potentially harmful to the home of the clean material.
Capping, the final step in the project, entails dumping clean dredged material from the Thames on top of the larger volume of contaminated material at the site. In theory, a three-meter-thick cap seals contaminants on the bottom of the Sound.
The one-mile-square site, in use since before World War II, is one and a half miles from Fishers Island, in an area where opponents said strong currents would spread contaminants, particularly if they are in the capping material.
In December the privately hired testers took seven samples from river-bottom areas to be used for capping while Navy observers videotaped from a patrol boat.
Test results showed traces of pesticides and heavy metals. Mercury, one of the most toxic heavy metals, was present in five samples in moderate levels, according to standards set by the New England River Basins Commission. The amounts ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 parts per million.
Mr. Rocque said the results were consistent with Navy findings. He said the moderate classification referred to ground disposal not to Federal standards for marine disposal. But Mr. Thatcher said the standards were the ones cited in the Navy environmental-impact statement for the dredging.
Although a portion of the disposal site is in New York waters, the Navy, the Army and Connecticut officials have said all dumping has occurred on the Connecticut side.
New York State challenged the project, saying New York permits might be needed because of the potential effects on the New York side. But the New York Attorney General's office dropped the legal action in Federal Court in Albany after Gov. George E. Pataki said in December that the dredging posed no damage.
The president of the 1,000-member Concerned Citizens of Montauc, Rav Freidel, attacked Mr. Pataki for "his support of the U.S. Navy's reckless poisoning of Long Island Sound." Mr. Freidel said in an interview that the project "was done in the name of national security."
"Give me a break," he said. "Where's the war? I'll tell you where. It's in Long Island Sound, and its the Government against our fish and our fishermen."
Mr. Rocque said Mr. Freidel's assertion that the project had been rushed to completion by dumping seven days a week 24 hours a day since October was "extremely economical with the truth."
"We are very careful about this stuff," he said. "We really are."
But Mr. Thatcher said conservancy members, including himself, ha' witnessed dumping during high winds and strong tides. "That has been going on from Day 1," he said.
The conservancy and other organizations like the Town of Southold, the Fishers Island Civic Association, the Long Island Sound Lobstermen's Association, the North Shore Baymen's Association and the Concerned Citizens of Montauk sued in Federal District Court in Uniondale in the fall to stop the dumping.
Those groups argued that dumping contaminated material in the Sound violated the Federal Ocean Dumping Act, which was amended to include the Sound. The Army, the Navy and the Environmental Protection Agency, the original defendants, argued that the dumping complied with all Federal laws. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, at its request, later joined the defendants.
After weeks of hearings Judge Thomas C. Platt ruled that the dumping could proceed. He said the opponents had failed to show that irreparable harm would follow the dumping. By the time of his ruling the work was nearly completed.
The opponents have subpoenaed a Navy report that catalogued contaminants near the Groton submarine base, a Federal Superfund site. Mr. Thatcher said the large report had information about highly toxic conditions in the Thames.
Mr. Rocque said he was familiar with the report. "Reports like that are used to inform us about what we should be looking for," he said. "But if you have a compound in the marine sediment that is chemically bonded to the sediment, the amount of the material is relatively irrelevant." He said many contaminants were bonded to sediments and remained so even when dredged up and dumped in the Sound.
Opponents have sharply different views. Mr. Thatcher said that the Navy made no tests for dioxin and that the cost of the samples, $2,000, limited the opponents to one test. But he said the tests showed that a number of the compounds were dioxin.
Dioxin is a highly toxic synthetic carcinogen that affects reproduction in fish, birds and mammals. "We found enough to show the Navy should have taken dioxin tests," Mr. Thatcher said.
He said the groups had spent nearly $100,000 for legal fees and expert testimony in the case in Uniondale.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS: Vox Populist;
Just Regular Ruling-Class Guys

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: BEDFORD, N.H.

 BODY:
THE most striking thing about Steve Forbes's rapid rise from the protected bubble of his corporate jet, the Capitalist Tool, to the turbulence of life as the hot Republican Presidential commodity is what his opponents are not saying about him.
They attack his flat tax plan as wacky. They attack his barrage of television commercials as mean-spirited and misleading. They attack him for lacking government know-how. 
 But they are more reluctant to fault Mr. Forbes for what may seem his most glaring vulnerability as the first official tests draw near: that this member of one of the wealthiest families in America has bought his way to the top of the field while touting as a panacea for the middle class a plan that cuts taxes for the rich.
That is because Mr. Forbes, of all people, has managed to acquire a label prized by contemporary American politicians: he is a populist.
Populist? America's original populists, those sharped-tongued champions of struggling farmers and silver miners, were enemies of wealth and power. Their political party of the 1890's favored Government ownership of railroads and telegraph lines and promoted the graduated income tax. Their attacks on big business helped inspire the Progressive movement, which contributed so much to the very New Deal liberalism that Mr. Forbes and his Republican rivals want to bury.
They were the tribunes of class conflict, the polar opposite of today's conservatives. "You will see arrayed on one side the great magnates of the country, and Wall Street brokers, and plutocratic power," a Kansas populist named L. L. Polk said in 1890, "and on the other you will see the people."
Now come the self-described champions of a new populism whose enemies are not New York plutocrats but Washington bureaucrats. They are a surprising lot -- wealthy or Washington insiders or both. Malcolm Stevenson Forbes Jr. Ross Perot, one of the world's richest men. Patrick J. Buchanan, son of Washington and member of its media elite. Senator Bob Dole, the ultimate insider. Senator Phil Gramm, another Capitol powerhouse. Lamar Alexander, businessman and corporate lawyer. Morry Taylor, the tire and wheel magnate. (Not to mention Bill Clinton of Hope, Ark., Yale and Oxford.)
Rush Limbaugh, who turned himself into a millionaire by playing Mr. Populist to his listeners and viewers, recently warned them against taking potshots at Mr. Forbes. "We're taking the whole issue away from our side," Mr. Limbaugh said, "if we're going to criticize wealth."
There is nothing new about rich people in politics. George Washington was rich. But the most successful politicians among the fabulously wealthy -- Roosevelts and Rockefellers and Kennedys -- appealed to poor and working-class people by promoting government programs for the disadvantaged. Now candidates are promoting economic conservatism as the new definition of populism. The circle has been closed -- Mr. Forbes has defined himself by attacking the graduated income tax that the first populists championed.
"The Government has fallen into such a state of disrepute that politicians want to pick up on an anti-statist feeling in the country," said Prof. Jamin B. Raskin of the American University law school, an expert on money in politics. "So populism becomes a catch-all label for anyone who challenges the political system. Every politician tries to pick up the chord of populism but in that sense the word begins to lose meaning."
Rich-guy populism does seem to require certain ritual obeisances to the lives of ordinary folk. George Bush made a display of eating pork rinds. Mr. Forbes stood out last week when he showed up at a black-tie Congressional dinner in a business suit. Mr. Buchanan sheds his starched white shirt (he shed his Mercedes when he ran in 1992) for down-home garb as he rails against the Washington establishment, upon which he built a lucrative career. Mr. Alexander campaigns in a plaid work shirt.
 
'Richie Rich'
 Despite their own hefty bank accounts, Mr. Forbes's opponents cannot resist digs: Mr. Gramm mocks him as "Richie Rich," and Mr. Dole calls him "Malcolm." But they don't suggest any contradiction between his background or program and his profession of the populist faith. "If I were going to go back and choose parents again, I might choose rich parents," Mr. Gramm said.
Mr. Gramm, like all politicians, is well aware that while middle- and low-income voters may be economically insecure, they don't blame the rich for their predicament. Many agree with the supply-side advocates that loosening Government restrictions on business is just what the nation needs to climb out of economic malaise.
Polls last week showed that Mr. Forbes is neck-and-neck with Mr. Dole in New Hampshire, the first primary state, and is popular among middle-income and independent voters. In dozens of random interviews in New Hampshire and Iowa, most voters, including Democrats, said they liked Mr. Forbes's outsider message and his willingness to spend his own money, since it showed he could not be bought by special interests.
"I'm more impressed because he's trying to do it with his own money," said Bruce Bowman, 38, a small-businessman from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, after a Forbes speech.
Even anti-Forbes voters see nothing peculiar about the confluence of wealth and populism. Barbara Bingham, a 61-year-old homemaker from Nashua, N.H., who plans to vote for Mr. Dole, said of Mr. Forbes, "I dislike him intensely." But when asked if he was trying to buy the race, Mrs. Bingham replied: "That doesn't bother me. I think he's sincere in what he says about populist things even if he has not experienced them."
That kind of sentiment was central to the success of Mr. Perot, who put $62 million of his own money into an independent run for President in 1992. Others followed suit.
"Michael was definitely running as a populist," said Arianna Huffington, an outspoken conservative whose husband, Michael, spent $29 million and came close to winning a Senate seat from California in 1994. "He had tremendous support from blue-collar workers, from Reagan Democrats."
Mrs. Huffington argued that voters have been more critical of wealthy Republicans than of wealthy Democrats. "Republicans spending their own money becomes a bigger issue because Republicans are supposed to be for the rich and Democrats are supposed to care for the poor," she said. "It's part of a stereotype the G.O.P. needs to shake."
There are similiarities between the populists of today and their 19th century counterparts. Mr. Buchanan comes closest, complaining about large corporations and warning of too many immigrants. Mr. Forbes sometimes sounds like an original populist when he attacks the financial takeover of the political parties by monied interests.
Still, it is hard to picture the scion of the Forbes publishing empire repeating what William Jennings Bryan said in a speech in Chicago 100 years ago when his Democratic Party embraced populism: "If I had behind me the great trusts and combinations, I know that I would no sooner take my seat than they would demand that I use my power to rob the people in their behalf."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Latest History of the Gulf War

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

 BODY:
EVEN at its best, as the late Phil Graham of The Washington Post said, journalism is no more than a first rough draft of history. And sometimes, as in the case of the war in the Persian Gulf in 1991, the draft is very rough indeed. Not surprisingly, the war's fifth anniversary last month prompted a series of revisionist retrospectives.
To a degree unprecedented in recent American history, reporters were limited in what they were permitted to see in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. A good deal of what they did see never reached print or got onto the air, at least in the brief period when the world was paying close attention. Some of what they were told by United States officials was untrue, either because the officials did not know the truth or because they did not wish it to be known. Finally, more than in most earlier wars, many reporters lacked the knowledge of the region and of military affairs to evaluate what was going on.
 
Unraveling Accounts
 Happily, some people have kept tugging at the sleeve of this history, long after the last shots were fired, and a lot of the official version of events is beginning to unravel. As ever, heroes are seen to be human as well as superhuman; villains are seen to have had a method in their villainy. Causes are seen to be complex, and so are results; victories are less than complete. It is a valuable corrective, if it does not go too far, and it is a process as old as war itself. If it does go too far, the pendulum of correction eventually swings back. Grant and Patton, to cite just two examples, have both been up, down, back up and back down again in the years since their feats of derring-do, and the books are not closed on either of them. 
 This ongoing revisionism is the very nature of history, especially where war is concerned. The confusion of combat is axiomatic, as is the difficulty of grasping the operations of a battalion from the vantage point of a squad or the operations of a corps from the vantage point of a battalion. Only after the controversy of political decision-making has cooled can the participants' stories be gathered, compared and evaluated. Only when secrecy is no longer an imperative can sensitive documents be declassified. Only with the perspective of time can cause and consequence be clearly seen. Changing the lens can reveal new insights and relationships, as has been the case with historians who in recent years have focused more on the manners and mores of ordinary people and less on the high and mighty, or (more controversially) those who have applied Marxist economic theories.
But academic victimology and intellectual political correctness has given the phrase "historical revisionism" a slightly gamy smell of late. Rightly so. The process cannot work if the new conclusions precede the search for new evidence or the reexamination of the evidence already on the record. Anti-American or right-wing or feminist or racial biases are not adequate, by themselves, to challenge widely accepted ways of looking at things.
In the case of the gulf war, the revisionism began almost as soon as the last shots were fired. "The gate is closed," General Norman Schwarzkopf famously declared in Riyadh as the fighting was ending, but it wasn't. It was wide open at Basra, as the whole world could see within a week when two-thirds of Saddam Hussein's elite Revolutionary Guard escaped back into Iraq. It took a little longer to see, in the postwar words of Maj. Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the commander of the 24th Infantry Division, that the whole end-game was flawed. With hindsight, it was evident not only that the cease-fire came before the trap had been sprung but that the trap itself was badly designed -- that the Marines attacking directly toward Kuwait City went off too soon and too fast, reaching their objective so quickly that the Revolutionary Guard divisions never moved south to help in its defense and could not be cut off by the allies' left hook across the desert.
 
A List of Failures
 That was one of the major conclusions of "The Generals' War" (Little, Brown & Co., 1995), the first really thorough account of the politics, the diplomacy and the fighting, written by Michael R. Gordon of The New York Times and Bernard E. Trainor, a retired Marine lieutenant general who now teaches at Harvard. Based on exhaustive interviews, equally free of hagiography and cynicism, the book won quick acceptance, even among many of the generals. It also documented American diplomatic mishandling of Saddam before the war; the failures as well as the successes of the Patriot missile defense system; General Schwarzkopf's temper, and General Colin L. Powell's extreme reluctance, born out of the shattering experience of Vietnam, to commit American troops to battle.
Last month, television documentaries moved the process along. In an interview with David Frost on the BBC, George Bush disclosed that he had worried that Saddam would pull back across the border at the last moment, making offensive action impossible for the allies but tying them down indefinitely in defensive positions. The correspondent Bill Kurtis on A & E suggested that some British and American soldiers' exposure to toxins unknown -- lead in the smoke from burning oil wells, nerve-gas pills, insecticides, poison gases released by allied bombing raids? -- had produced genetic defects in their children.
A pair of two-hour "Frontline" programs on PBS offered testimony from important figures -- Brent Scowcroft, Generals Powell and Schwarzkopf, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Margaret Thatcher and the former Iraqi foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, among many others -- and challenged a lot of conventional wisdom. Civilian officials like Mr. Scowcroft and his deputy, Robert M. Gates, to say nothing of President Bush, had far more stomach for battle than the top generals, by "Frontline's" account and their own, and even some of the ground commanders, such as Lieut. Gen. Fred Franks of the VII Corps, were timid when battle came. The programs demonstrated how ragged the ending really was, with American mistakes at the Safwan talks inadvertently aiding Saddam in suppressing Shiites, whom the United States had urged to rebel, and in clinging to power. (Mr. Bush admitted as much in the Frost interview.) Mrs. Thatcher, who played an important role in stiffening President Bush's resolve, noted that she and Mr. Bush soon lost power, while Saddam "the aggressor" stayed in office. "I wonder who won," she said.
The answer to that, of course, is still hotly debated. The Iraqis were thrown out of Kuwait, a message of international resolve was delivered and Saddam's wings were clipped. But Shiites and Kurds in Iraq were massacred by Saddam's troops all the same, the regime in Baghdad is as repressive as ever and its nuclear- and chemical-warfare capacities were not destroyed as claimed. Like all wars, this one was full of ambiguity. Vietnam and its lessons remain contentious to this day. Whether the struggle in the gulf was worth the candle --- the loss of life, the billions of dollars spent --- is a question for decades, and for revisions of history, still to come.

Life at the Top: Jerry Bailey Reflects on Cigar

BYLINE: By JERRY BAILEY 

 BODY:
Cigar, who went 10 for 10 at the races last year to establish himself as the obvious horse of the year and the best horse of the decade, will begin his 1996 campaign next Saturday in the Donn Handicap at Gulfstream Park in Florida. When he became a star last year, Cigar was already 5 years old. Now he's 6, and trying to do it again, with some expert guidance from his jockey, Jerry Bailey.
The 38-year-old Bailey is a star in his own right. He was inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame last year and also received the Eclipse Award as 1995's top jockey. He has been riding Thoroughbreds for two decades, long enough, as he makes clear in this article, to appreciate the once-in-a-lifetime experience that Cigar represents. 
 In recent months, many people have asked me what it's like to ride a horse like Cigar. I still have trouble responding, because the answer goes beyond stakes victories and purse earnings.
Frankly, I don't think I'll ever be around this situation again, because horses like this don't come around very often -- especially to the same jockey.
In fact, until Cigar, I never got too attached to horses because they come and go. I ride so many of them -- last year, I participated in 1,400 races -- that I simply don't have the time to develop any rapport.
I do remember riding Cigar for the first time in a grass race at Belmont Park in October 1994. He finished third, and didn't leave much of an impression.
After that, I watched him win a race on the dirt at Aqueduct, but I didn't ride him again until his next start: the N.Y.R.A. Mile in November 1994, his last race that year.
In that race, he won with complete authority and for the first time I had the feeling that he could be something special.
As it turned out, he was more than special. And in the course of his 10 straight victories in 1995, there were two incidents that really stamped him as a champion in my eyes.
The first came in the Oaklawn Handicap at Oaklawn Park on April 15, against the best group of handicap horses you could assemble at the time. As we were turning for home and approaching Silver Goblin, the rider on Silver Goblin, Dale Cordova, in an attempt to hit his own horse, struck Cigar right on the front of the face with his whip.
Most horses would have trouble dealing with that kind of a blow and would probably back out of the race at that point. The great ones turn it into something positive.
As for Cigar, he shook his head and pinned his ears, as if the whip had made him mad. He dug down, quickly opened up a couple of lengths on the field and won by two-and-a-half lengths.
The second incident took place in the Hollywood Gold Cup at Hollywood Park July 2.
As we were running around the first turn, tucked in behind five or six horses, a huge clod of dirt hit Cigar right in the middle of the head. He shook his head, grabbed the bridle in his teeth, nearly took the reins out of my hands and started running as hard as he could. I tried to hold him back and I was actually able to for about half a mile.
By then, the blood was gone from my fingertips, and my arms were exhausted. I had no choice but to let him run at that point, although I didn't think I would be able to hold the whip in my hand because my fingers were numb. The result? He won by two or three lengths.
Besides his mental toughness, Cigar is different from other horses because he is so efficient in his stride. His motion is so fluid, I don't ever feel him accelerating, except when he's leaving the starting gate.
And during the course of a race, he normally doesn't assert himself that hard at any one moment. It's a gradual flow. The only way you really know you're going fast is because you're whooshing by horses. With most good horses, you'll feel them go into another gear. And Cigar just doesn't do that.
With most horses, the pressure of running in all these top races would overtake them at some point, but with Cigar, I always knew in my heart last year that I could never get him into a situation, traffic-wise, that he wouldn't get me out of. That's how overwhelming he is.
In 1991, I won the Preakness and Belmont Stakes on a colt named Hansel. As good as he was, though, he hated to run inside horses so I was constantly trying to figure how to get him to the outside.
For a jockey, that's a nightmare, because any other smart jockey is going to pick up on that and try to trap you inside. Cigar does not have those idiosyncrasies: It is impossible for another jockey to find a chink in the armor. There is none.
Riding Cigar last year also gave me an appreciation for the average person who comes to the track and wants someone to root for. I noticed that when Cigar ran in the Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs in June.
I was on an all-sports radio station for a half an hour after the Massachusetts Handicap and again later in the year, and I can't tell you how many people called in who had gone out to the track that day to see Cigar run who don't normally go to the races. And that's what was really gratifying to me: that a horse like this can bring people out to racing. And believe me, racing needs it.
When Cigar came back to Belmont Park after that race, to his home base and mine, I really started to get to know him.
He had his routine: He'd go over to the track every morning and exercise -- whether it was a gallop or a work -- at around 7 A.M. and come back and get washed down. By a quarter to eight, he'd be taken out by Erma Scott, his hot walker, and be grazed in an enclosed area behind the barn of his trainer, Billy Mott, at Belmont.
I usually had some free time at that point in the morning -- there was track renovation from 8 to 8:30 and nothing much to do -- so I'd go and sit on the fence and watch Cigar graze and I kind of think he knew who I was. He'd come up, kind of sniff me and look at me and then go about his business.
In a sense, Cigar has more than one personality, depending on how close he is to a race. If it's within two or three days of a race, you don't want to get too close to him in front of the stall -- he might reach out and take a finger off. He's very aggressive and very focused. But in the weeks right after a race -- and he usually has a month between races -- he's a pretty docile horse. You can go up and pet him for two or three minutes and he'll be pretty submissive.
Actually, he's kind of a ham; he likes people looking at him and taking pictures of him. And he's the same way grazing.
I had never interacted with a horse the way I was interacting with Cigar. There were just too many horses and their careers were too fleeting. Just take the three other Breeders' Cup Classic winners I rode. I was on Black Tie Affair just one time and that was in the 1991 Classic right before he retired. As for Arcangues, the 1993 Classic winner from Europe, I merely saw him in the paddock, got on him, won -- and then he went overseas again. I'd ridden Concern, the 1994 winner, a couple of times, but he was an out-of-town horse, so I'd never really gotten to develop a rapport with him, either.
So my time with Cigar was a lot of fun for me. I was enjoying it. It wasn't like it was taking time out of my day; I really liked it.
When racing shifted to Saratoga, Cigar stayed behind at Belmont Park for a little rest, and I missed him. Then it got brutally hot down at Belmont Park for two or three weeks, so they brought him up to Saratoga, where it was a little cooler and I started going to see him again.
I had several people come up and stay with me during the Saratoga meet because I was being inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame and I'd say, "Want to come see Cigar? You've got to be real quiet and stay in the background, but come see him."
Billy Mott was very sporting about that, and so was Cigar.
As for this year, Billy has him prepared and where Allen Paulson, his owner, wants to run him, that's where he's going to go. So many people in the past have gotten a good horse and after one good year, he's off to stud for economic reasons. And that's not the case here.
As for me, I'm still driving the same car, living in the same places. The only thing I've done is put a little money in my 3-year-old son Justin's college fund.
If you ask Justin who his favorite horse is, he says, "Cigar." My wife, Suzee, has enjoyed the Cigar experience right along with me. She's probably the one who taught me the most about "appreciating the moment," and I'm grateful for that.
Two or three weeks after Cigar won the Breeders' Cup Classic, I went by Billy Mott's barn to see what was going on. And Billy said, "While you're here, I want you to do something for me."
Cigar was what they call walk-tacking, walking with a saddle on in the shed row as a way to let him cool down from training. And Billy said, "Get up on the horse."
And I got up one him, with no helmet on or anything, and I just walked around the barn on him for 30 minutes or so and I really enjoyed it. At first, when I got up on him -- because I think he knows the difference between a light rider like myself and a heavier exercise rider -- he thought he was going to go out and do something and he was kind of spunky. But after about 10 minutes, he settled down.
I was never one to just want to ride a horse. It was always the competition that got me going. But it was very enjoyable that morning walking around the shed row on Cigar, talking to him and reliving the memories.

HEADLINE: The Future of Taiwan

 BODY:
With the cold war over and the nations of East Asia booming, arguments over the status of Taiwan might seem the relics of another era. Sadly, they are not. A sudden surge of Chinese belligerence toward Taiwan has made the island one of the most volatile issues facing America and the world. Before the issue turns into a dangerous crisis, political leaders in Beijing, Washington and Taipei need to step back from confrontational policies and put Taiwan back into perspective.
For the better part of a year, China has been campaigning against attempts by Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, to win back some of the international recognition that Taiwan lost two decades ago when most of the world accepted Beijing's claim to be the legal Government of China. The mainland has conducted military maneuvers and missile tests off the island's coast to pressure Mr. Lee. 
 China should end this intimidation at once. Politicians in Taipei should stop indulging their voters and provoking the mainland with symbolic campaigns for international recognition and concentrate instead on building and protecting the freedoms and autonomy that Taiwan already enjoys.
Congressional Republicans, for their part, should refrain from inflammatory gestures like inviting Taiwanese leaders to Washington. Such official invitations call into question America's commitment to recognize only one China. The Clinton Administration must calmly, firmly and consistently remind Beijing that America's one China commitment is explicitly premised on the mainland's peaceful conduct toward Taiwan.
Taiwan is now neither an independent country nor a province governed by Beijing. After Chiang Kai-shek lost the Chinese civil war in 1949, he fled to Taiwan with his supporters and grandiosely proclaimed his administration the Government of all China. For cold war reasons, the United States went along with this fiction until 1979, when it shifted American recognition to the Communist regime in Beijing. That left Taiwan in diplomatic limbo, since Beijing insisted that any country recognizing the mainland regime break relations with Taiwan.
There increasingly is a case to be made for Taiwanese independence. Taiwan has not been ruled by China for most of the last century. It has a different political and economic system and its people enjoy a freedom and affluence many rightly fear could not survive under Communist rule.
But at least for now the costs of pressing for independence would exceed the potential gains. The most obvious cost is the very real risk of Chinese military attack. A showdown now over Taiwanese independence would also almost surely bring a rupture in relations between the United States and China. Given China's huge population, nuclear status and rapidly developing economy, such a crisis would have global implications.
Beijing, Taipei and Washington should lower the volume of the debate and avoid forcing issues that are best left alone for now. Beijing should stop flaunting its preparations for imminent military action. Taipei should stop pretending it can somehow redefine its international status without provoking a reaction from Beijing. The White House and Congressional leaders should agree to jointly counsel restraint on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
Such a formula would allow Taiwan to hold on to and develop what it cares about most -- its freer, more prosperous way of life. It would allow Beijing to coexist with Taiwan without forfeiting its claims to eventual sovereignty. It would give American political leaders of both parties a chance to help preserve Taiwan's freedoms without wrecking relations with Beijing.

HEADLINE: Word for Word/There You Go Again;
But Seriously, Folks, He Was Funnier Than Nixon

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV 

 BODY:
IT'S not every former President who has a chance to be a multimedia sensation, especially one who counted among his most humbling experiences a confrontation with a kindergarten computer class. "There they all sat in front of their computers," Ronald Reagan told a group of Republican women in 1984. "Finally, the one I was sitting beside said, 'Well, go ahead and push the button.' I was scared to death."
Democrats may be scared to death to push the button on a new CD-ROM, "President Ronald W. Reagan: Well, There You Go Again! The Humor That Shaped America, Volume One." The CD, compiled by N. R. Mitgang and Malcolm Kushner in conjunction with the Ronald Reagan Library, includes "every form of humor used by Ronald Reagan during his first Administration (covering over 500 different events as well as Ronald Reagan's philosophy and position on basic issues)." 
 The quips and anecdotes on the CD are delivered, as they originally were, with a studied cock of the head and a catch in the voice. Most of the material is offered in both text and audio forms, allowing this critical judgment: While Mr. Reagan's delivery improved the material, he benefited even more from that perquisite of the powerful -- a remarkably receptive audience. To mark his 85th birthday, on Tuesday, here is a sampling. ERIC ASIMOV
Mr. Reagan, the oldest President, had a zillion laugh lines about his age, but apparently only one joke:
To the Oklahoma State Legislature, March 16, 1982: "I appreciate having this opportunity to speak with you during the 75th year of your statehood. And it's not true that I was in the original land rush."
To the carpenters' union, Sept. 3, 1981: "This union has a proud history. Just 100 years ago, having only a few thousand members, you opened your first convention in Chicago. Now, it's not true that I attended that convention also."
State of the Union message, Jan. 26, 1982: "President Washington began this tradition in 1790 after reminding the nation that the destiny of self-government and the 'preservation of the sacred fire of liberty' is 'finally staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.' For our friends in the press, who place a high premium on accuracy, let me say, I did not actually hear George Washington say that."
And then there was the letter-from-a-child gambit:
First speech after assassination attempt, April 28, 1981: "I have a letter with me. The letter came from Peter Sweeney. He's in the second grade in the Riverside School in Rockville Centre, and he said, 'I hope you get well quick or you might have to make a speech in your pajamas.' He added a postscript. 'P.S. If you have to make a speech in your pajamas, I warned you.' "
To the National Governors Association, Feb. 24, 1981: "One letter that really moved me was from an 11-year-old boy who wrote and said: 'When you get there, don't look to the past; look to the future. You won't have time to look to the past.' And he said, 'Make up your mind that when you leave there you will be older, and tired, and there will be a few more gray hairs in your wise old head.' And then he said, 'Just get to the office, go to work, and be happy that you're only President, you don't have to be God.' Out of the mouths of children. . . ."
For someone followed by a phalanx of Boswells, repetition is inevitable. Mr. Reagan used pre-emptive strikes:
To the Nevada Republican Party, Feb. 7, 1984: "Life not only begins at 40, but so does lumbago and the tendency to tell the same story over and over again. So, if you've heard it, just be polite and pretend you haven't."
At this point, some of the jokes have lost resonance:
At Point Mogu Naval Air Station, Feb. 19, 1981: "I know the ladies know about inflation. Once upon a time you used to put some money in your purse and go to the market and buy a bag full of groceries. Now you take a bag full of money, go to the market, and bring the groceries home in your purse."
And now, back to an inexhaustable topic:
To the White House News Photographers Association, May 16, 1984: "As you record history in the making, you, yourselves, are a part of historic tradition. Ever since Matthew Brady took his stirring pictures of Abe Lincoln and the Civil War, photographs have been imparting immediacy to American news. And it isn't true that I carried Brady's camera."
To the Ohio Association of Broadcasters, Oct. 24, 1984: "Coming in here, I couldn't help but reminisce and think about my first job at WOC, Davenport, Iowa. I'm not going to tell you how long ago that was. But it's not true that I was hired by Marconi."
While Mr. Reagan's one-liners leaned toward the cornball, some of his longer stories displayed surprising edge:
At a reception honoring National Review magazine, Feb. 21, 1983: "You know, a fellow comes in, stands in front of your desk, hands you a memorandum, and he stays and waits while you read it. And so you read:
'Action-oriented orchestration, innovation, inputs generated by escalation of meaningful, indigenous decision-making dialogue, focusing on multilinked problem complexes, can maximize the vital thrust toward nonalienated and viable urban infrastructure.'
I take a chance and say, 'Let's try busing.' And if he walks away, I know I guessed right."
To the Knights of Columbus, Aug. 3, 1982: "There was a fellow riding a bicycle one cold winter day -- motorcycle, I should say. The winds coming in through the buttons of his leather jacket were chilling him, and finally he stopped, turned the jacket around, put it on backwards, took it off again. Well, that solved the wind problem, but he hit a patch of ice; his arms were kind of restricted; he skidded into a tree. And when the police got there and elbowed their way through the crowd that had gathered and they said, 'What happened?' They said, 'We don't know. When we got there, he seemed to be all right. But by the time we had his head turned around straight, he was dead.' "
Not surprisingly, there are references to people and events no longer topical:
Speaking by telephone to the White House Correspondents Association, April 25, 1981: "I hope you don't mind, but David Stockman is making me call collect."
Presenting a check for the Westway project to Mayor Edward I. Koch of New York, Sept. 7, 1981: "Secretary of Interior Jim Watt would have been here, but he's working on a lease for strip mining of the Rose Garden."
Perhaps Mr. Reagan's greatest strength as a raconteur was his ability to return to earth fast:
On his return from a trip to Japan and South Korea, Nov. 14, 1983: "Coming home from Korea and Japan, all of us bring with us renewed energy and renewed commitment to our fundamental goals, building a new era of peace and prosperity -- just as soon as we readjust our clocks."

HEADLINE: U.S. WARNS CHINA OVER VIOLATIONS OF TRADE ACCORD

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER with STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Despite concerns about Washington's already tense relationship with Beijing, the Clinton Administration has warned China that it risks the imposition of stiff economic sanctions in the next few months because Beijing has ignored previous warnings and continues to violate a key trade agreement signed a year ago.
The warning, made after a series of White House meetings in recent days to reassess the Administration's China policy, comes despite considerable concern from some officials that prompting a confrontation over China's piracy of American software, music and videos could harm Washington's effort to defuse growing tensions between China and Taiwan. 
 Those officials also fear that the trade dispute could hamper American efforts to convince Beijing that it must end its crackdown on dissidents and stop the sale of missiles and other military hardware in South Asia and the Middle East.
But in the end, Mr. Clinton's economic and trade advisers, led by Mickey Kantor, the Trade Representative, convinced the White House that American credibility with China and other trading partners around the world would be jeopardized if Beijing is permitted to flagrantly ignore its agreement to close more than 30 compact-disk factories -- some apparently controlled by the Chinese military -- that are exporting millions of dollars worth of illegal copies of American products.
Mr. Kantor has warned China that the sanctions could be as large as 100 percent tariffs on more than a billion dollars in Chinese imports. But White House officials, still nervous about how hard to press Beijing, say they will not determine the exact nature of the sanctions, or their timing, until completing the negotiations that begin in the coming week.
Three months ago, Mr. Kantor issued a less specific, public threat of sanctions against China in hopes that Beijing would act against the factories making the pirated copies. Unsatisfied with the response, he went back to the Chinese on Wednesday to insist that time was running out.
Some aides to Mr. Clinton concede that election-year politics may color the decision over how hard a line to take. There is growing concern in the White House that Mr. Clinton's policy of "comprehensive engagement" with China -- and the decision two years ago to extend China's favorable trade benefits independently of its human rights record -- has shown virtually no results. That would provide Senator Bob Dole and other Republican Presidential aspirants with an opening to tar Mr. Clinton with the same charge that Mr. Clinton made about George Bush four years ago: that he is coddling the Chinese Communist leadership under pressure from American business interests.
The issue of China's piracy is particularly potent in California, the most critical state in the November election. Hollywood has lost millions of dollars because of the illegal replication of movies and music, and many of the plants that once churned out compact disks have converted to much more lucrative products -- illegal copies of computer software. Mr. Kantor, a longtime political operative in Southern California and Mr. Clinton's former campaign manager, is close to many of the executives in that industry.
On Wednesday, in a speech carefully reviewed by the National Security Council and National Economic Council, Mr. Kantor declared to the U.S.-China Business Council, a private group that represents American businesses in China, that the United States will "take decisive action if China does not meet its obligations." And he warned, "We will not wait forever."
In other forums, Mr. Kantor has said Washington would impose a larger sanction than the one it threatened a year ago but suspended when China agreed at the last moment to sign an accord promising a crackdown on the piracy of American products. The new sanctions are justified, he said, because China "is not only selling these goods in its own market, it is beginning to sell them around the world."
The same day that he gave the speech to the Business Council, Mr. Kantor delivered a similar warning to China's ambassador to the United States, Li Daoyu. And it is to be repeated in coming days, when one of Mr. Kantor's deputies begins the 17th round of talks with Chinese trade officials in Beijing over enforcement of the accord.
China's Deputy Foreign Minister, Li Zhaoxing, is due in Washington from Monday to Wednesday for an as-yet-unannounced visit in which he is expected to meet high-ranking American officials from the State Department and the White House.
Some Asia specialists in the State Department disagree with Mr. Kantor's aggressive strategy, as does the Deputy Treasury Secretary, Lawrence Summers, who at a recent White House meeting questioned whether it was worth jeopardizing America's huge interests in China "over the copyright on Mickey Mouse."
Several China experts have warned that in China's view the threat of sanctions is an attempt by the United States to "contain" what is fast becoming the world's second superpower.
But Mr. Kantor has argued the opposite: that China will only respect American toughness -- on Taiwan, human rights and other issues -- if Washington does not back down when it comes to enforcing previously negotiated agreements.
Senior officials say Mr. Kantor's strategy has been approved by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. But at least one participant in the meetings recalled that "the issue has to be pursued with some balance," one reason that Mr. Kantor has not set a date by which China must destroy the factories or enter into licensing agreements to make their products legitimate.
"You hear the argument a lot that we should not be retaliating now," said Gregg Mastel, a China scholar at the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington trade and economics think tank. "But it is clear that the Chinese are testing our credibility on intellectual property. They don't want to crack down on this gravy train, but they will do it if they fear it threatens their lifeline: exports."
The piracy issue is expected to set the tone over the next few months for what American officials know will be a very difficult period for Chinese-American relations.
The annual State Department human-rights report will be released soon, having been delayed by the Government shutdown, and "we will tell it like it is about China," a senior American official said, while not expecting Beijing to like or react quietly to the report.
Moreover, China's threatening military exercises near Taiwan and explicit warnings to Taiwan ahead of the March 23 presidential elections there have left the United States in a delicate position. Traditionally, American forces have served to defuse potential conflicts in Asia.
The United States has warned Beijing "to cool it" around Taiwan, officials say, though they say there is no evidence of an imminent attack across the Taiwan Strait.
And American officials have done little to hide their anger at Taipei for its unrelenting efforts to seek a larger international status and role, pressing for "unofficial" visits and transit visas to the United States. The most recent downturn in American relations with Beijing came with the Administration's decision last year -- under Congressional pressure -- to allow Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, into the country for a reunion at Cornell University.
Also in March, the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva will decide whether to condemn China's crackdown on dissidents and other human rights abuses. The United States was hoping to avoid co-sponsoring a condemnatory resolution this year, but officials say there is now little alternative.
In May, Congress will have to review a Presidential decision to renew China's preferential trading status. "The concern is that unless we have the intellectual property issues resolved, Congress could refuse to go along," one of Mr. Clinton's top economic advisers said the other day.
Such threats -- that failure to comply with a trade accord could prompt a Congressional backlash -- have long been a staple of American trade-negotiating tactics with Japan.
But the mood in Congress is worsened by the growing evidence of human rights abuses and a soaring American trade deficit with China. While exports to China are booming, the overall deficit rose last year to about $37 billion, according to the Commerce Department. Mr. Kantor noted the other day that the deficit "is threatening to surpass our trade deficit with Japan."
Administration officials concede that their decision two years ago to "de-link" trade issues from other concerns, a step China insisted would create "a more constructive atmosphere," has largely failed. Instead, a senior American official said, "there has been no progress in human rights and even setbacks."
American officials also believe that their messages to Beijing are misunderstood as China's political leaders maneuver in preparation for the death of the country's supreme leader, Deng Xiaoping. The initial dispute over President Lee's visit to the United States was partly attributed to misunderstandings last spring during a meeting between Mr. Christopher and his Chinese counterpart. And there is a sense that Mr. Clinton's periodic meetings with Chinese leaders have been so stiff and formal that no real communication has taken place.
"Their view is that we're containing them and want to keep them weak," the official said, though he went on to say that while some Chinese leaders may believe that, others simply say it to put Washington on the defensive for tactical reasons.
The relationship is so odd, that "China is the only country in the world where we have an almost daily exchange of public views expressed through spokesmen," said the State Department's public voice, Nicholas Burns. "We'd like to get to the point where we're not debating transit visas in public."
But at times the American message has also been muddled by domestic politics. Given the demands of the American political debate in a Presidential election year, the supposed fire wall between economic issues and the political relationship will be hard to maintain.
For instance, the United States says it will accede to China's admission to the World Trade Organization as soon as Beijing agrees to meet the "commercial requirements" of the 120-nation treaty: lowering import barriers, loosening controls on foreign investment and trade, and abiding by international conventions, including those covering copyrights and patents.
But Chinese officials argue that the United States is blackballing Beijing to contain the expansion of China's economy, and thus limit its national strength. An argument that began over a trade accord has become an issue of national pride -- with billions of dollars riding on the outcome.
"There are a lot of mine fields out there," a senior Administration official said.

HEADLINE: Fears That Loss of a Math Ph.D. Program Figures in a Bigger Equation

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
The University of Rochester is scuttling its doctoral program in mathematics, a move that has surprised and angered scientists and educators nationwide, who worry it could signal erosion at America's research universities.
If Rochester could take such a step in tough financial times, they say, so could other leading universities. They are also concerned that it is a recipe for disaster at Rochester, a university respected for its strength in science and technology. 
 "This is not good for Rochester, for American science or for the country," said Arthur Jaffe, a mathematician at Harvard and president-elect of the American Mathematical Society, which condemned the decision last month.
Professors at other universities in the United States and abroad have urged Rochester to reconsider. Dr. Steven Weinberg, a Nobelist in physics, in one of the many letters sent to Rochester's president, Thomas H. Jackson, wrote: "It seems to me extremely unwise to eliminate your program in an area like mathematics, that stands at the intellectual center of a large part of modern science."
The physicist Herman Feshbach, a former president of the American Physical Society and a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technolgy, put it bluntly: "In one fell swoop you have reduced the University of Rochester to a second-class status," he wrote.
Rochester defends its decision as necessary and sound in a time of budget constraints, pointing to operating deficits and a math department of only modest distinction. University officials say Rochester is only facing up to what other universities will also increasingly be called upon to deal with, as universities face financial pressures because of declining Federal aid, tuition revenues and state support.
"This is an issue almost every university is going to have to wake up to," Mr. Jackson said. "Most universities are going to have to pick and choose. I'm very confident that as hard as this decision was to make, it was the right one."
But even as he reaffirmed the decision, he offered the mathematics department an opportunity to test whether science, engineering and other quantitatively-oriented departments really cared about the program by asking the other departments how much they would be willing to pay out of their own pockets to save the graduate math program. But where the university saw such a poll as a concrete measure of the interest of other departments, the math department saw "the tragedy of the commons," the classic problem described by the ecologist Garrett Hardin, who said that the problem of the overgrazing of a common meadow cannot be solved by asking individuals to limit their cows from grazing voluntarily but must be addressed by a central policy reflecting the interest of all grazers together.
Now that the mathematics faculty members have rejected the idea of the poll, Mr. Jackson says it is up to them to make their case to the other departments.
"The math department needs to start opening the dialogue with other departments," he said yesterday. "They need to listen to them and try to persuade them. If they make headway, we will pay attention."
Mathematics is one of five graduate programs the university is phasing out; university administrators say they have not heard similar complaints over cuts in anthropology, comparative literature, linguistics and chemical engineering.
While the university will suspend its Ph.D. program, it plans to keep 10 of its 21 tenured faculty members and use adjunct professors for entry-level math courses. The cuts in tenured faculty are to be made through attrition.
"I don't disagree that mathematics is a core discipline," said Mr. Jackson. "But does that mean you have to run a Ph.D. program? To me, that linkage is much more tenuous than people in the mathematics community believe it to be."
The furor over the decision has struck a nerve, though, among many academicians worried about who will conduct and pay for research -- particularly theoretical research in subjects like mathematics -- if Federal money for research and higher education is cut. Universities like Rochester have been a large and important part of America's research base for half a century.
So far, Federal financing for scientific research, including mathematics, has held up: According to the National Science Foundation, federally financed expenditures for research in mathematical sciences at colleges and universities grew to $206 million in 1994, up slightly from $203 million the year before.
But many universities, including Rochester, have other financial problems. And there is a broad consensus that too many Ph.D.'s -- including too many mathematics doctorates -- are being produced nationally. When it comes to making cuts, however, there are differences over what should go.
"One can argue that there should be cuts," said M. Salah Baouendi, a mathematician at the University of California at San Diego who headed a committee of the American Mathematical Society that studied Rochester's cutback in math. "But one hopes these cuts would take place at the weaker programs, not the stronger ones, like Rochester."
Few are suggesting that Rochester will lose its standing as a research university. "There is not a standard-issue model of what you have to have to be a first-class research university," said Cornelius J. Pings, president of the Association of American Universities, a by-invitation coterie of 60 research universities, including Rochester.
Still, by cutting back mathematics, Rochester has touched an area long considered sacrosanct -- an integral part of many other disciplines, from engineering and the sciences to the social sciences.
"It is clearly a blow to the status of mathematicians and to their princely egos," said David Breneman, an economist who is dean of the Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia. "But they're not killing off a premiere, top-10 program, and there are probably more institutions that should do something like Rochester has done."
When Mr. Jackson began as president of Rochester in July 1994, the university, like many others, had been running operating deficits for many years. An expert in bankruptcy law who had been provost at the University of Virginia, Mr. Jackson had a broad mandate to position the institution for the long term.
In November, he proposed a broad plan to give the university a new focus on undergraduate education. The plan called for cuts of 20 percent or more in undergraduates and graduate students, and a 10 percent cut in faculty.
To determine which departments to cut, administrators weighed factors that included departments' stature, their finances, their teaching skills and their interrelationships within the university.
The university deemed the math department one of only "modest distinction" (it tied for 58th among 139 departments in the recent rankings by the National Research Council), called its undergraduate instruction "less than optimal" and said that its interaction with other departments at the university was minimal.
The mathematics department contests many of the university's judgments. Not only are its national ratings higher than those of some of the graduate programs being retained, it says, but its teaching ratings have been better than average in the school of science, and its faculty has done better than those of many other math departments at winning outside financing and has more interaction with other departments than the university has recognized.
Joseph Neisendorfer, chairman of the math department, calculates that the annual savings from closing his graduate program, which does not have heavy laboratory and equipment costs, will come to less than $1 million, considering that the average faculty salary in his department is less than $60,000 and that the total annual cost of stipends for graduate students is about $180,000.
Professors have yet to tell him of any plans to leave, he said. But he -- like the university -- anticipates that the best ones, with the most mobility, will.
"I do think you can get a good mathematics education at a small college without graduate programs," he said. "No one would deny that. But they are devaluing the mathematics department in the context of Rochester remaining a research university with other graduate programs. Any mathematician who comes here will be a second-class citizen. How are we supposed to recruit good people in those circumstances?"

HEADLINE: Mexican Drug Gang's Reign of Blood

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MATAMOROS, Mexico

 BODY:
The drug trafficking suspect Juan Garcia Abrego and his men became so brazen, and the citizenry so terrorized, during a decade of bloodshed in this border town that a gunman said to be working for him once shot a municipal policeman dead on a downtown street for giving the gunman a parking ticket and local newspapers largely ignored the crime.
When a young reporter, Oscar Trevino Jr., revisited the murder in a year-in-review piece months later, his publisher ordered the story killed. And when the article made its way into print anyway because of a newsroom mix-up, the publisher called Mr. Trevino to a restaurant to apologize to Mr. Garcia Abrego personally. 
 Mr. Garcia Abrego, who was arrested last month in Mexico and expelled to the United States, is to be arraigned on Tuesday in Houston on charges of cocaine trafficking and money laundering -- but not homicide.
Yet his United States indictment charges that he ordered "the murder of numerous individuals." And residents of his hometown, across the border from Brownsville, Tex., said he had ordered scores of killings. Many of their accusations have been corroborated by court testimony.
"The history of Matamoros during the reign of Juan Garcia Abrego was painted in blood and shame," said Jesus Cruz Medrano, an editor at the newspaper El Bravo. "For years, we have all lived in enormous fear."
Those whose murders Mr. Garcia Abrego is accused of ordering include disloyal subordinates, commercial adversaries, crusading journalists, hostile witnesses and romantic rivals. Many victims, like the two-month-old baby killed by mistake when the reputed trafficker's gunslingers sprayed a Matamoros home with automatic rifle fire in 1991, have been complete innocents.
Eduardo Valle, a senior Mexican Government investigator who pursued Mr. Garcia Abrego in 1993 and 1994, said the reputed trafficker was careful to isolate himself from killings. "He never gave instructions personally to his triggermen," Mr. Valle said.
Killers in many cases included Tamaulipas state and federal police officers, Mr. Valle said. The policemen were among hundreds of Government officials, including a deputy attorney general, to whom Mr. Garcia Abrego is said to have paid millions of dollars in monthly bribes.Mr. Valle and others contend that the reputed trafficker's ties to the Government of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari went even higher.
Whether such matters will be discussed during his trial is not clear. During Mr. Garcia Abrego's first interview with Federal Bureau of Investigation agents in Houston last month, he said he "would be glad to answer any and all questions" the agents asked him, the F.B.I. says. But his lawyer, Roberto Yzaguirre, said his client was not cooperating with prosecutors and would plead not guilty.
Asked about accusations that Mr. Garcia Abrego had ordered murders, Mr. Yzaguirre's assistant, Michael L. Sinder, said, "We don't intend to discuss Mr. Abrego's life with anybody."
Mr. Garcia Abrego's reputation for brutality first emerged in 1984, when he was a 39-year-old multimillionaire, the head of one of Mexico's rising drug gangs. During a battle for control of the Matamoros border with a rival trafficker, Casimiro Espinosa, one of Mr. Garcia Abrego's aides ambushed and badly wounded Mr. Espinosa.
At dawn the next day, May 17, 1984, gunmen in camouflage uniforms burst into the Raya Clinic, a private hospital where Mr. Espinosa was convalescing. During their 10-minute attack, they fired off 300 rounds, killing a guard, a husband and son who were visiting their ailing mother, a bedridden 35-year-old woman, and Mr. Espinosa's sister.
Mr. Espinosa survived the mayhem, but died of his original wounds days later.
Two years later, Ernesto Flores, 48, the editor of El Popular, then the largest-circulation daily in Matamoros, and a reporter, Norma Morena, were slain. Gangsters waiting at the newspaper entrance blasted the journalists' car with gunfire, then killed them with shots to the face.
One of Mr. Garcia Abrego's assistants, who took refuge in the United States later, said publicly that Mr. Garcia Abrego -- irritated by El Popular articles -- had ordered Mr. Flores's murder.
In 1991, a hired gunman named Armando Barrera took refuge in Brownsville and in a sworn deposition accused Mr. Garcia Abrego of ordering the murder of his brother and 35 other people. Most of the victims were shot to death, but some were tortured, burned alive or tied up and hurled into rivers, Mr. Barrera said.
Months after lodging his accusations, Mr. Barrera was gunned down in Brownsville.
Despite the seemingly endless bloodletting in Matamoros, there has been little protest about Mr. Garcia Abrego's presence. Hundreds of millions of dollars in drug proceeds have filtered back into the local economy, and people associated with him own banks, farm machinery and auto dealerships, clothing and shoe stores, real estate and construction companies, hotels, restaurants, seed companies, gas stations and farms, according to court testimony and interviews here.
In a city that was at once so bloodied and so compromised, community leaders -- politicians, lawyers, journalists -- have largely remained silent about the narcotics violence, said a Matamoros lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"What do you do in a city like this?" the lawyer said. "You keep quiet."
But Mr. Garcia Abrego's arrest has encouraged some new candor. On the day after his expulsion from Mexico, the headline in PM, the afternoon newspaper in Matamoros, read: "An End to 10 Years of Narco Terror!"

HEADLINE: Needs of Poor Veterans Draw New V.A. Focus

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: PERRY POINT, Md.

 BODY:
At a time when the Federal Government is squeezing many social programs, the veterans medical center here, on a serene 400-acre campus on Chesapeake Bay, has opened a cozy new refuge for people like Stanford Avant.
After his discharge from the Marine Corps, with which he had served in Vietnam, Mr. Avant spent 25 tortured years "drinking and drugging," as he puts it, on the streets of Wilmington, Del. Now he is 46, and he has been at Perry Point since a sanctuary for homeless veterans opened here in September. 
 He gets free health care, three meals a day and a room with a desk, a chair, a chest of drawers and, on the bed, a bright fluffy quilt. He also receives psychiatric and job-preparation counseling. "I'm feeling like I'm worth something," he said.
The Department of Veterans Affairs is best known for its network of hospitals, which continues to expand despite a decline in the population of veterans and despite health care trends that are forcing many other hospitals to close. But now the department's insulation from the fiscal and political pressures confronting the rest of the Government has helped give it an important new role as an agency that cares for the poor.
And a poor veteran often gets assistance that a welfare recipient accustomed to nothing more than cash or food stamps might find lavish.
"If you're a vet," said Martha Burt, director of social service research at the Urban Institute, a Washington-based research organization, "you have a resource that a lot of other people don't have."
With the plunge in the number of war-maimed veterans treated at the agency's 173 hospitals, the V.A. has been turning more of its attention to veterans who are among the nation's drug-addicted or indigent, mentally ill or physically disabled. To qualify, most need only have put in some time in the service, in combat or not, in wartime or peacetime.
"If you serve 180 days on active duty," said one Republican Congressional aide who specializes in veterans issues, "and if for whatever reason you do not succeed in life, you get this complete safety net."
As a result, a department that is the nation's largest employer of doctors and nurses has also become the largest employer of social workers, with 4,241 on the payroll last year.
The cost of programs for homeless veterans, though still a minuscule part of all Veterans Affairs spending, has more than doubled in three years, to $75 million from $32 million, and much of that is used to support 94 centers like the one here. Such programs are often the sole source of help to a part of the population -- single men -- for whom access to other kinds of government aid is the most restricted because they generally do not have dependent children.
As for total spending, while many Federal agencies face cuts under White House and Congressional proposals alike for the still-unsettled 1996 budget, Veterans Affairs, supported as strongly as ever by a politically potent phalanx of veterans organizations, appears assured at least a small increase from the $37.7 billion of the last fiscal year. President Clinton has proposed adding $1.7 billion, and he has vetoed legislation that would have added $200 million.
Given Washington's tight-budget environment, Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown, a Vietnam veteran whose right arm was disabled in combat, has had to contend with a new skepticism from Congressional Republicans and the White House Office of Management and Budget toward a V.A. spending request that once would have gone unchallenged. "Everybody beat up on me," Mr. Brown said.
But in thwarting big budget cuts, he said, he has been supported by Mr. Clinton, whom many veterans berate for having avoided the Vietnam-era draft and who is sensitive to their political power.
Mr. Brown notes that the agency is required by mandate to provide free health care to only some 10 million veterans, about 40 percent of the nation's total of 26 million.
Fewer than half of the men and women it must serve are those, rich or poor, who are at least 50 percent disabled by "service-connected" conditions: illnesses and injuries that occurred during active duty or that, years after discharge, can be traced to active duty. The others whom the V.A. must serve are loosely defined as poor, those whose annual incomes are less than $20,469, which is close to the average earnings of an American worker.
Many members of both groups are covered by private health insurance or Medicare, however, and so those who actually enter a Veterans Affairs center for free care are often very poor. Twenty-seven percent of all new V.A. hospital patients are homeless, Mr. Brown says, and so the agency is becoming more attentive to their needs as a whole.
In addition to free medical care, many veterans receive monthly benefit checks. An indigent veteran who has a disability wholly unrelated to his years in the service can collect $650 a month. To qualify, he must have served at least 90 days (including at least one day during wartime, though not necessarily in a combat zone) and be unemployable because of the disability. Last year, that program supported 432,000 veterans.
Benefits for veterans with service-connected disabilities are more generous -- up to $1,800 a month -- and wartime service is not required. Under that program last year, 2.2 million veterans received checks that averaged $400 a month.
Perry Point specializes in psychiatric care but has added care for homeless veterans in "domiciliaries," a uniquely V.A. institution that once provided just meals and shelter for indigent veterans but has now expanded to treat various conditions that they bring in from the street.
The room, board and counseling in domiciliaries accommodate just 6,000 a year of the 250,000 former servicemen who the agency estimates are homeless. But through hospitals and clinics, alcohol and drug treatment centers, job training and rehabilitation, subsidized care for the house-bound and outreach offices in cities, Veterans Affairs reaches hundreds of thousands of other poor veterans.
Phyllis Osbun, acting chief of the domiciliary care program here, opened Perry Point's first domiciliary for the homeless in September and will add another this year, so that in all she will be able to serve 50 clients. To be admitted, a veteran may have an income of no more than $1,100 a month.
The common denominators among Ms. Osbun's clients are alcoholism, drug addiction and the mental disorders that can arise from either.
Reginald Marks spent his time as a marine in Japan and at Camp Lejeune, N.C., mostly as a clerk who was trusted with supervision of supply cages containing weapons and ammunition. After his discharge, he says, he took to drinking and drugs. Then, about three years ago, a girlfriend accused him of assaulting her. "I was drunk," Mr. Marks said. "I really don't know if I hit her."
He was convicted and spent two years in jail. Upon his release, he said, a V.A. counselor asked him whether he wanted to continue his life sober. "I said yes," the 39-year-old Mr. Marks recalled, "and they sent me over to the dom." After four months here, he said, "this is the first time in 20 years I've been sober for this long."
In defending against budget cuts those programs that help veterans like Mr. Marks, Secretary Brown, former president of the Disabled American Veterans, makes a distinction between veterans and everyone else the Government helps: veterans earned their care, he says, by volunteering, or being forced through the draft, to risk their lives in defense of the nation.
"When I think of veterans," Mr. Brown said, "I think of missing legs, missing arms. There's a moral obligation that the nation has to those who served it and served it well."
That obligation, he said, applies equally to peacetime veterans. "I have no problem providing that person with full medical care," he said, "because that woman or man was there for the nation if need be."
Veterans' advocates say the V.A. fills holes that have been torn in the safety net of nonveterans programs. In addition to helping ill, disabled and poor men, it is an important source of aid to drug abusers and alcoholics -- all people whom other Federal programs either reject or have made targets of spending reductions.
"We are the only ones out there that can actually respond to people like that," Mr. Brown said. "Society should say, 'Thank God for the V.A.' "

GRAPHIC: Photo: The Department of Veterans Affairs says 27 percent of all new V.A. hospital patients are homeless. So the department is devoting new attention to their broadest needs, partly by creating "domiciliaries" and expanding other programs at existing medical centers like this one in Perry Point, Md.

HEADLINE: With First Voting Near, Republicans Ask Who Can Win

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 3

 BODY:
In the final weekend of campaigning before the first actual votes are cast, candidates for President stormed around New Hampshire, Iowa and Louisiana today, each jousting for advantage in an atmosphere that is looking increasing volatile.
What was most notable about the dialogue on the campaign trail today, as in recent weeks, was that it had not evolved into a debate over the budget machinations on Capitol Hill or over one defining issue like the economy, as was the case here four years ago. 
 Instead, there seems to be no overwhelming issue other than the candidates' squabbling over whether a flat tax is good for America and what form it should take and over who has the best chance of beating President Clinton in November.
The first test is at the Louisiana caucuses on Tuesday. But that will be a showdown between Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and the conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan because most of the other candidates chose not to compete. They did not want to offend Iowa and New Hampshire voters who were threatened by another state's horning in on their tradition of holding the first contests.
After a year of sitting atop a commanding lead in the polls, Senator Bob Dole is struggling to keep his front-runner position in the first two important battlegrounds, Iowa and New Hampshire, as his rivals are fighting for the chance to take him on. Several have cast themselves as Washington outsiders and sought to outflank each other on the right.
Kicking off a three-day tour of Iowa, which holds caucuses on Feb. 12, Mr. Dole acted very much like the front-runner. "We are the front-runner," Mr. Dole told about 200 supporters gathered at the Holiday Inn in Dubuque this morning. "We know we're going to take a lot of heat. A lot of people are spending a lot of money. But we've got a message to tell the people in Iowa, and we're going to stick with that message."
Mr. Dole pointedly avoided mentioning the names of any of his opponents, particularly Steve Forbes, the publisher who has threatened to topple his lead in the polls in recent days. The majority leader left it to the other candidates today to keep up their attacks on Mr. Forbes, though later on at an event in Indianola his aides passed out news releases criticizing Mr. Forbes.
After a rather lackluster run-up to the primary season, in which the most excitement seemed to be over whether Colin L. Powell would run, the candidates were beginning to display signs of the excitement of a campaign in full force.
"We've had the warm-up now for some time," Mr. Dole said, "and we're ready to go."
While Mr. Dole had Iowa virtually all to himself today, the most frenetic stumping was here in New Hampshire, where voters in the nation's first primary, on Feb. 20, were courted not only by a handful of Republicans but also by the President.
Mr. Clinton, who has the luxury of being unopposed in the primaries, maintained such a posture of Presidential reserve that it was hardly possible to tell that he was a candidate. In appearances at a police substation and parish hall in Manchester and in a roundtable discussion on small business at a hydraulics company in Merrimack, he assured his listeners that the question was no longer whether big government was acceptable but how to make a small government work more sensitively and efficiently.
The President did engage in some real campaigning. He started his day at the Chez Vachon diner on this city's west side, which he visited twice in the 1992 campaign. He had a vegetarian omelet with no cheese but indulged in pan-fried potatoes.
"Here's where it all started," Mr. Clinton said as he walked around the restaurant. "It's wonderful. It's good to be back."
But campaigning just a few miles away, in hamlets and towns that were newly covered by an overnight snowfall, the Republican contenders eagerly engaged in bald political jockeying. They were spurred to press hard by recent polls that show Mr. Dole may not have an easy stroll to the nomination.
A daily tracking poll of 485 people released today by the American Research Group here in Manchester showed that as of Friday among likely primary voters, Mr. Dole had 23 percent. But it also showed that Mr. Forbes's momentum may be slowing. He has hovered in today's poll and earlier ones around 18 percent, while Mr. Buchanan was creeping up and is now also at 18 percent. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus five percentage points.
Speaking to an audience that packed the Town Hall in Nashua, N.H., Mr. Gramm hammered away at Mr. Forbes, whom he wants to knock out of the way before he can take on Mr. Dole, by portraying him as a liberal.
"Bill Clinton on many issues would run to the right of Steve Forbes," Mr. Gramm asserted. "Bill Clinton is the only liberal in this campaign. Let's keep it that way."
Nearby, a the Hesser College gymnasium in Manchester, Mr. Forbes ignored Mr. Gramm and others as he set his sights on the leading contender, Mr. Dole. He called on Mr. Dole to drop a television commercial that asserted that Mr. Forbes's flat tax proposal would raise taxes in New Hampshire.
"All of my advertisements have been issue oriented," said Mr. Forbes. But the targets of many of his commercials have accused Mr. Forbes of distorting their positions.
While most of the campaigning was in New Hampshire, Mr. Buchanan stumped through Louisiana today in a final push before the caucuses on Tuesday. He said that the competition was turning in his favor with the endorsement on Friday of Gov. Mike Foster, who chided Mr. Gramm for accepting donations from the gambling industry.
Like Senator Gramm, Mr. Buchanan also portrayed Mr. Forbes as a liberal. "I think the Dole campaign continues to implode," Mr. Buchanan said in an interview from a car phone on his way to the Sylvester Crawfish Processors in Whiteville, La. "At some point the voters are going to catch up that behind all the videotape of Steve Forbes's ads is a social liberal."
Unlike four years ago, when New Hampshire was in a slump and the economy was the prevailing issue, the candidates this year have been searching for issues that would hit home with the voters. Even before 1992, there seemed to be more dominant issues, like the cold war or inflation.
"The primary is very volatile right now and I would say every Presidential primary is volatile at this point," said Robert Craig, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire. "But with this one there are no clear anchors of issues. There are no clear points of view for voters."
Morry Taylor, the Michigan businessman, also campaigned in New Hampshire today, and Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana was due here on Sunday. Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee took a break and was home in Nashville today.
One voter, Henry Bertel, 54, a pipefitter from Somersworth, said the campaign was reaching an intense stage but less from actual campaign than from the saturation of television commercials.
"It's pretty intense right now," he said. "And it's because of that fellow Forbes and what he's done on television."

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Governor a Tough Rival for Senator Kerry

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
While it swept across most other parts of the country, the Republican revolution of 1994 spared Massachusetts. Not a single incumbent Democrat in Congress lost, leaving unchanged the state's reputation as one of the most left-leaning in the nation.
But this year, Republicans in Massachusetts are crowing. They not only see a chance to pick up a seat or two in the House delegation, where the Democrats outnumber them 8 to 2, but in Gov. William F. Weld, they also see a challenger to Senator John Kerry who might be popular and personable enough with his hybrid form of Republicanism to win a Senate seat for his party. The last time a state Republican did that was in 1972, when Edward W. Brooke was re-elected to a second Senate term. 
 At the same time, by leaving the Statehouse so soon after his re-election in 1994, Mr. Weld has catapulted the race into national prominence as a contest between two popular officeholders with opposing views on most issues, some that even set them apart in their own parties.
Mr. Kerry's supporters, many of them impressed with Mr. Weld's success in reducing the size of the state government and cutting taxes 11 times in five years, say that Mr. Kerry, who is seeking a third term and is one of the remaining moderate Democrats in the Senate, has never faced such a tough election. Calling Governor Weld "the strongest Republican in Massachusetts," Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Democrat from Lowell, conceded, "He's a threat, no question about that."
As Republican Presidential candidates like Bob Dole, Phil Gramm and Patrick J. Buchanan try to outflank one another on the right, Mr. Weld represents a more iconoclastic mix -- fiscal conservatism, social libertarianism and a strongly held view that "government ought to do less with less," as the Governor said today in an interview in his office.
That combination has played well around the state, supporting a notion that Massachusetts, which Bill Clinton won in 1992 with 48 percent of the vote, might not be so liberal as its national image suggests.
While registered Democrats outnumber Republicans about 3 to 1, Mr. Weld has been elected twice with support from moderates of both parties. He won in 1994 with 71 percent of the vote, while Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the standard bearer of liberalism, won a sixth term by his lowest margin ever, with 58 percent of the vote to 41 percent for his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney.
"Bill Weld is consciously trying to carve out a spot on the ideological spectrum," said David Osborne, a co-author of the book "Reinventing Government" (Addison-Wesley, 1992), "that is different from where gravity is in the national party. He is probably where Republicans need to go to be the dominant party in the future."
After winning the governorship by three percentage points over his Democratic opponent, John R. Silber, in 1990, Mr. Weld immediately set his views of minimalist government in motion. He balanced the budget in his first year in office, cut taxes seven times, reduced the growth rate of Medicaid from 20 percent to less than 3 percent and eliminated 8,000 state jobs. After his re-election in 1994, Mr. Weld passed the most stringent welfare legislation in the nation, cut taxes four more times and proposed further reductions in the size of state government.
Like many Republicans, he supports the death penalty, term limits and $245 billion in tax cuts that Republicans say will balance the Federal budget, all of which Senator Kerry opposes. But the Governor steps away from other party-line positions by supporting President Clinton's national service program and his 1994 crime bill. He also supports gay rights, abortion rights, environmental protection, student loans, grants for university research and development, and tax credits for low-income wage earners.
Mr. Weld has also tried to distance himself from his recent characterization of Speaker Newt Gingrich as "my ideological soul mate" by saying, "That was probably too strong an imprint for this state."
Many Massachusetts voters have suggested that Mr. Weld has grown bored with being Governor. But he assures them that is not the case at all.
"I've got this place running pretty well," he said. "I'm amazed that in Washington they have not been able to do what we are doing here. I am surprised to the extent Washington lets partisanship get in the way of results. I think I can make a difference there, a big difference."
Mr. Kerry argues that Mr. Weld's policies have failed to address the economic insecurities facing average citizens.
Mr. Kerry's solutions to those problems, a mix of public-private collaboration in which government would play a leading role in education and job-training programs, make him also appear to be something less than a cookie-cutter member of his party. While he shares concerns with other Democrats over tax breaks and subsidies for businesses, a policy that opponents call corporate welfare, he supports programs that he says will promote economic growth, like reduced capital gains taxes, and has questioned some aspects of affirmative action.
"This is the fight, one of the most important in a long time," the Senator said the other day over a bowl of clam chowder, echoing themes that Mr. Clinton raised in his State of the Union Message last week. "Not only do we have a fiscal deficit in this country, but also a cultural and spiritual deficit. These also need to be addressed, and I don't accept the view that government has no role."
Mr. Kerry cited the Works Progress Administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy's support for strengthening the economy through tax cuts and incentives as examples of government at his best. "I'm in favor of a smaller Federal Government," he said, "one that's less bureaucratic but also one that provides greater empowerment of communities."
Both candidates were born into wealthy families within 19 months of each other -- Mr. Kerry is 52, Mr. Weld 50 -- and they share similar pedigrees. Mr. Kerry is a lawyer from Yale, Mr. Weld a lawyer from Harvard. Both served as prosecutors before running for office. And both lost before they won.
By the late 1960's, however, they were headed down different political paths. Mr. Kerry served in the Navy in Vietnam and became a decorated hero, but when he returned he organized Vietnam veterans in 1971 to protest against the war. A bad back kept Mr. Weld out of the war.
Watching veterans struggle in their return to civilian life helped convince Mr. Kerry that government should play a leading role helping less fortunate people become productive citizens. Mr. Weld, meanwhile, became fascinated with the works of Friedrich A. von Hayek, an economist who warns against the increasing power of government.
With the campaign just beginning, each has already found the other an easy target. Mr. Weld said he planned to "hang the nanny state around my opponent's neck," a reference to the Democrats' softer line on welfare and Mr. Kerry's willingness to maintain a larger government than Mr. Weld.
Mr. Kerry said he would attack Mr. Weld as an aloof administrator whose policies abandoned people who most needed help to adjust to economic change. The Senator said he would question Mr. Weld's consistency on some issues, like his support for immigrants rights and his early endorsement of Gov. Pete Wilson of California, whose brief Presidential campaign highlighted anti-immigrant positions.
But the larger question is whether a popular Republican Governor can convince a largely Democratic electorate that his unusual mix of politics would better serve the country when Republicans and Democrats in Washington can agree on little more than the weather.
That is just the point that might scare away the Democrats Mr. Weld needs to win.
"To most people he's, hands down, superior to John Kerry," said Mr. Osborne, the author. "But my gut says he can't win. People in Massachusetts don't want to send another vote to Washington for Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich."

HEADLINE: Where Big Snowfalls Are No Reason to Moan

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Wyo., Feb. 2

 BODY:
Against the brilliant white landscape of a 10,450-foot summit here, a snow blower worked doggedly today, clearing a path to allow an aerial ski tram to pass without dragging through snow drifts.
"There was not enough room for the chairlifts to run," Scott Caplan, 21, of Philadelphia, said of the record snowfall that blanketed Jackson Hole this week. "Until now, I had never skied in powder up to my waist." 
 From the Tetons to the southern Rockies, ski boots are squeaking in freshly packed powder as skiers line up to take advantage of January snowfalls that were double and sometimes triple monthly averages.
For an industry haunted by stagnating ticket sales and by the aging knees of baby boomers, the January blizzards give the sport, in the par lance of mogul-jumping snow boarders, "free air."
The Rockies, the nation's dominant ski region, sold 50 percent more ski-lift tickets last year than either of its closest rivals, the Northeast or the Pacific West.
"If it snows, they will come," said Kelly Ladyga, spokeswoman for Colorado Ski Country U.S.A., a resort group for the state that attracts the biggest number of skiers. "We are like snow farmers. And without the snow, the skiers stay away."
Last winter, skier days across the nation were down by 3.6 percent from the previous season. With spotty snowfalls giving this season a bumpy start, Colorado's skiing days were down by 2 percent last November and December.
But today, much of the Rocky Mountains, from Wyoming to Utah to Colorado, looks as if it had been hit by a pastry chef who was overgenerous with icing. Fresh snow hangs from eaves, sometimes joining drifts on the ground in unbroken snowy arcs.
At Jackson's airport, where jets touch down daily with Eastern skiers, piles of snow bulldozed from the tarmac rise as high as the one-story terminal. In Breckenridge, Steamboat Springs and other Colorado ski towns, shoppers thread their paths through shoulder-high mazes created by unrelenting snowfalls.
In Frisco, another Colorado ski town, traffic accidents have doubled, crews have trucked 8,500 tons of snow from the business district, and workers have dug holes in snow mounds to uncover fire hydrants and stop signs.
"February and March are typically our big snow months," said Tim Mack, director of public works for this alpine town 75 miles west of Denver. "So now we are wondering where we will put all of this snow when we get more in the next couple of months."
With Colorado's high country disappearing under eight and a half feet of snow in January, 15 of the state's 23 ski resorts recorded record January snowfalls.
The champion was Steamboat Springs, which recorded slightly over 18 feet, nearly triple the normal January snowfall. Steamboat's January snowfall is the largest recorded for any month in Colorado in this century.
In a publicity coup for a publicity hungry industry, the Steamboat Ski and Resort Corporation happened to be the host of a six-day convention of television weather reporters in late January.
Mike Lane, the resort's spokesman, said: "With 20 weathermen from around the country, and 105 live shots from the area, once the snow dumped on us, people were seeing it in their hometowns all over the country. And then the calls started coming in."
Here in the Tetons, Seth Konheim, a 33-year-old New Jerseyite, disembarked from Jackson's ski tram this morning for his first run. Joining three friends from New York, he said, "We've been tracking the weather from New York for several days now."
Around the Rockies, resort operators report that bookings are heavy for the Presidents' Weekend this month, the industry's February high point.
After 8 feet of snow fell in 10 days on Crested Butte, resort operators sealed a deal with American Airlines to provide daily jet service for six weeks from Dallas to Gunnison, the nearest airport to the southern Colorado ski area.
For Vail, the nation's largest ski area, 14 feet of new snow in January was a blessing. With snow falling 26 days in January, Vail received almost triple is normal snow quota.
Here at Jackson Hole, the 10-foot snowpack has stunned skiers, amateur and professional, young and old.
"It's been awesome," Joni Madere, a 25-year-old Jackson waitress, said today as she clutched her snowboard, waiting for the aerial tram.
Pepi Steigler, an Austrian Olympic gold medalist who started the ski school here 30 years ago, preferred to call conditions "superb."
"The quality is unbelievably good," said Mr. Steigler, a veteran whose creased face spoke of a life on the slopes. "We haven't seen this kind of snow in over a decade. We used to have it in the '60's and '70's."
At the base of Jackson's tram, in an office adjacent to spinning flywheels, these words were confirmed by statistics kept by Larry Livingood, an avalanche hazard forecaster for the resort. Last Sunday, Mr. Livingood's sensors measured 24 inches that had fallen in 24 hours.
"In 30 years, that's the most snowfall we have ever seen," he said, running a finger down snow statistics recorded since the resort opened here in 1966. The ski area's total January snowfall of 140 inches was the highest January accumulation since 1970.
In the Rockies, this symphony in white also brought a few discordant notes.
In Idaho, Sandra Day O'Connor, the 65-year-old Supreme Court Justice and skiing enthusiast, broke her right shoulder on Tuesday while testing Sun Valley's new powder. She was reported to be recuperating well.
In Colorado, five small mountain passes were still blocked by snow avalanches.
On Friday, a ski patrol, concerned about skiers' safety, set off an avalanche that ended up burying three cars, two snowplows and a shuttle bus at the Loveland ski area. The site of the avalanche, which swept away 100-year-old trees on a quarter-mile path, might become a new ski run.
In Wyoming, road crews were only able to open today a mountain highway pass that had been blocked between here and Idaho since Sunday. With the road closed, many service workers who live in Idaho were unable to commute to work this week in this affluent community.
North of here, heavy snow forced officials to close Yellowstone National Park for two days. In recent years, snowmobile tours of the park have become a major contributor to Jackson's winter economy.
"The only way I can get out is by snowshoeing for two miles," said one of several snowbound residents here, Jean Weiss, managing editor of Jackson Hole magazine.
With frigid weather and a massive snowfall pushing pockets of the Rockies back in time, it seems fitting that Sunday will see the re-inauguration of an old pastime here.
With shouts of "yee" and "haw," parka-clad mushers from around Arctic North America are to drive their husky teams down Jackson's snow-covered streets for the first International Rocky Mountain Stage Stop Sled Dog Race.

HEADLINE: A DIRECTORY OF WORLD CRUISES;
Busy Seas, Exotic Ports

BYLINE: By VERNON KIDD; VERNON KIDD writes about ship travel and music festivals for the Travel section.

 BODY:
IN a wait-and-see economic climate, at least nine major new ships will be sailing this year, some of them having entered service in December, and others are planned for introduction as far ahead as 1999.
Two new ships, which together added space for 3,700 passengers at the end of 1995, are the Sun Princess, at 77,000 tons Princess Cruises' largest ship, which entered service in Fort Lauderdale, and the Century, Celebrity Cruises' first 70,000-ton ship, which made an elegant entry into New York after a storm-tossed Atlantic crossing. At the end of a week of festivities, she headed for the warm waters of the Caribbean. 
 Noteworthy among other new ships is the Destiny of Carnival Cruise Lines, the first cruise ship in the 100,000-ton category with a capacity of 2,600 passengers. More than half her staterooms will be suites with sitting rooms and balconies, and she will have a nine-deck-high atrium, a three-deck-high auditorium for Broadway-style shows and a three-deck-high slide to one of the pools. Before the Destiny arrives in November, Carnival will launch the 2,040-passenger, 70,367-ton Inspiration next month, and Costa Cruises will introduce the 1,950-passenger, 75,000-ton Costa Victoria in July.
Among others are the 1,750-passenger, 72,000-ton Galaxy of Celebrity Cruises due in December, the 1,266-passenger, 55,000-ton Veendam of Holland America Line, scheduled to enter service in May, and the 1,804-passenger, 69,000-ton Splendour of the Seas and the 1,950-passenger, 74,000-ton Grandeur of the Seas, both of Royal Caribbean Cruises. The Splendour of the Seas is expected next month, and the Grandeur of the Seas is scheduled to arrive in December.
On a smaller scale, Victoria Cruises is introducing its 154-passenger Victoria III this month for service on the Yangtze River, and Swan Hellenic will put its new 300-passenger Minerva, originally announced as the Okean, into service in the Mediterranean in April.
The Mediterranean is continuing to see an increase in ships sailing there on a year-round basis, and both Dubrovnik and Beirut have returned as ports of call. Interest in other offbeat ports like Tartus in Syria and Sousse and Tunis in Tunisia is also growing, and the Trimiti Islands off the Adriatic coast of Italy remain an alternative to ports in the politically tenuous eastern Adriatic. East African ports like Mombasa in Kenya and Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and the islands of Madagascar and the Seychelles are growing in popularity in the Indian Ocean, as is Zanzibar, where investors are seeking to turn the island into a free port that might someday rival Hong Kong.
A new port, Calica, in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, close to Tulum and Coba, will be visited by Norwegian Cruise Line later this year, and Holland America Line is planning to call there when the port is completed in 1997.
This directory covers sailings from March 1 to Oct. 31. Dates, ports of call and fares are subject to change. Unless otherwise noted, fres are for one person in double occupancy, excluding port taxes. More information is available from travel agents or the cruise lines.

HEADLINE: Long Island Q&A: Stanley Braginsky;
Why Olympus Decided to Keep American Headquarters on L.I.

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN 

 BODY:
WHEN Stanley Braginsky became president of Olympus America Inc. in Melville on Oct. 1, 1994, he became the first American to hold that post in the 26 years that the company has been a subsidiary of the Olympus Optical Company of Japan.
Mr. Braginsky, 58, joined the company in 1970. A graduate of Queens College, he first worked at the American Optical Company in Buffalo. 
 He and his wife, Sharon, have three children and live in Dix Hills.
Q. Why were you, an American, selected to head a Japanese-owned company?
A. I think the trend in Japan toward globalization has moved not only from a concept, but in many cases to a reality. The concept of globalization, at least in the Japanese context, is to localize and use as many local people to respond to local markets. And Olympus, being one of the more aggressive and the more optimistic companies, has chosen to go with an American.
Q. Like JVC?
A. So has Sony and some of the larger auto companies. But Sony did it much earlier than the other Japanese companies. It was much more progressive than the others, which did it within the last five years.
Q. Is there a difference in styles?
A. Yes. The concepts of how to do business and the decision making is quite different. Once a decision is made, the flexibility of accommodation is different. I think business generally transcends most cultural issues. Whether you are in business in Japan or the United States or Europe, everybody basically has the same ideas and aims. Customer satisfaction -- the customer is No. 1 -- doesn't vary very much. If you have that as your goal, the way you do business is basically the same. It's a matter of decision making and the inflexibility of the decision making that is different.
Q. Is decision making more of a cooperative venture here?
A. You try to get more of a consensus instead of being autocratic. At times it can be autocratic. But I think consensus is the more ideal procedure in getting things done.
Q. Is that in Melville?
A. No, I think it's general. I try to adopt what I think works in this cultural and social setting from what I've seen in Japan. In many cases it adapts well. In some it doesn't.
Q. What is an example?
A. When you have a staff meeting the style I've been using is that the staff can influence and is informed that it should influence decisions. They don't come from the top down, unless I finally lose my patience. Then you have to take the leadership that is necessary.
Q. Do you come in with a suggestion and ask whether they agree or just lay out the problem to be solved by everyone together?
A. Both ways. It depends on the type of problem. If it's a divisional problem, I ask them to please solve it and come back. If it's a corporate problem, I give them some ideas of how I would like it solved and then have their response. Not that there's a buy-in, but that there's an understanding of what the problem is and how we would like it solved. The style I think is one that fits the two cultures we have to work with, one in Japan and the other in the United States.
Q. Would you recommend it to American companies?
A. It depends on the company. I think it works in many cases. But again, you can't ever fail in leadership, whether you're depending upon a Japanese-based consensus business decision-making process or American autocracy. In all cases leadership management must be basically the same all over the world. The leader has to be perceived as the leader, and he must have a goal, and it has to be made very clear.
Q. So that the people buy into it more?
A. I don't like the word buy-in. Buy-in means you have more or less shifted responsibility. I believe in more of a consensus, where you have made your arguments, and it's more like a court of judgment. Everyone has heard the two sides, and the decision is made, each having an opportunity to sway the opinion. But it isn't a buy-in. Once the decision is made there is no buy-in. You must perform.
Q. What work goes on in the headquarters?
A. This is strictly a business office. We have a manufacturing facility in Albuquerque and a major repair facility in San Jose, Calif.
Q. This was a company that was established in 1968 and had offices in Lake Success and Woodbury.
A. That's correct and that's why we came together here. Consumer products was in Woodbury, and our scientific products were in Lake Success. We wanted to put the two organizations together, get management combined and get the synergies that you get when you can centralize.
Q. When did you start looking for a new building?
A.Over five years ago. We were turned down in Huntington by people who felt we may not be the neighbor they wanted.
Q. Why didn't you leave Long Island?
A. That was considered, seriously considered. But when you consider that a business runs on its people and we have 550 people and many, many of them are very competent, I didn't want to lose them. There would have been a total disruption.
Q. With the Melville site Olympus stayed in Huntington.
A. I live in Huntington Town. The Town of Huntington was in all cases very helpful. It was correct in responding to the concerns that the homeowners had. I don't think it is necessarily a good idea for industry to push its way into areas local residents feel is inappropriate. I have no problem with that. It was just very frustrating that it took so long. It started in 1992 and went through 1993, quite an extended period.
Q. Did the case go to court?
A. The community threatened to go to court. The problem, we felt, when you are dealing with the state against the community is that the courts would stretch this out to some indeterminate date, and our leases were being extended. We had to move. We considered moving off Long Island. The pressures of finding a facility were tremendous, and our expenses and rent all had increased.
Q. Where did you look?
A. We started looking in New Jersey and we were also considering going down to Maryland. We had an office in Columbia, Md.
Q. Had you looked at your present site before?
A. We had looked at this site -- which we moved into about five months ago -- in 1992 and we rejected it. It was a Grumman building, and we felt it was not the structure we wanted. Internally it was not appropriate for our business. But when Mutual of New York picked up the building it was gutted, and the only thing that was left were the girders, the windows and the floors.
Q. How big is the building?
A. Approximately 270,000 square feet.
Q. How many Of the 550 employees are from Long Island?
A. About 500 of them.
Q. Had you spoken to them about relocating?
A. No, we looked at it from a corporate need, and there were so many people that we would have needed that it would have been impossible.
Q. What did the people in Japan say or was it basically up to you?
A. It was up to us. But it's always best to have a consensus. They are very happy, although they think it's a little big. When you compare it to the expensive real estate in Japan, this would be a luxurious site in Japan. It's comparable if not better than the state site.
Q. How do you respond to people who say it is not economical to do business on Long Island because the cost of living, wages, taxes and utility rates are too high?
A. I think some of what you say is correct. Transportation is poor. There is still regional segmentation for schools. Taxes are too high. Our utility rates are too high, and there are too many police departments. What you have here is a redundancy that increases the tax base, and taxes on Long Island are just too high. But the productivity and the people are really what keep companies here. You have Computer Associates and Symbol Technology and other hi-tech companies on Long Island.
I wish the state would support the university at Stony Brook a little more, to give us a "world-class" university on Long Island. We draw and depend upon educated people here, and our university system is under a great deal of pressure. Generally we have a very good labor supply, and that is key to any company.
Q. Where do you hire from?
A. We try to use local people. We are an international company. We sell all over the United States, and our business really is not on Long Island. We also draw people from such places as California and Virginia.
Q. What are the plans?
A. We'll be expanding our product line. We'll be going into digital imaging and communications. But we will also support our four core businesses, our medical health-care group, endoscopes and microscopes, chemistry analyzers, and consumer products such as cameras and tape recorders.
Q. Do you plan to increase business in Latin America?
A.Right now we are in the $50 million range, and I'm planning in the next five years to see a 300 or 400 percent increase.
Q. Where are your products made?
A. Currently, I would say, 95 percent of our equipment is made in Japan. That will shift. Japan is a very expensive provider of equipment. It's of the highest quality, and at times pricing is not as competitive as it used to be. So we'll be looking at broadening our line with competitive products made in the United States, as well as Europe.
Q. Would you hire other companies?
A. That's correct.
Q. What proportion of the products will be made in Japan in the next 10 years?
A. Seventy-five percent or less. That's a major shift, but that helps the company stabilize and be less influenced by the fluctuation of currencies.
Q. As a board member of the Long Island Association, what would you like to see it concentrate on?
A. We would like to see it take the lead in fostering technology and technology companies on Long Island. There are very particular problems that these companies have such as manpower and government regulations. Sometimes there are government regulations that are eliminated that do not support American technology.

HEADLINE: A Church Asunder Awaits the Pope in Salvador

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR

 BODY:
Gunned down by a right-wing death squad in 1980 as he was celebrating Mass, Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero has been revered ever since as "the saint, prophet and martyr of Latin America" by the progressive wing of the Roman Catholic Church here and throughout the region.
But when the Vatican needed to name a new Archbishop of San Salvador last spring, Pope John Paul II chose to ignore that legacy. Instead of turning to a close associate of Archbishop Romero, as the clergy here had requested and the Pope had done on an earlier occasion, the Pontiff selected Bishop Fernando Saenz Lacalle. Bishop Saenz is a Spanish-born prelate who is a former Vatican liaison with the Salvadoran Armed Forces and a clerical member of Opus Dei, a conservative lay organization dedicated to promoting traditional Catholic doctrine. 
In a country still reeling from the dozen years of civil war in which Archbishop Romero and 75,000 other people were killed, most of them by the Salvadoran Army, Rome's decision came as a shock. And the impact of the move has reverberated far beyond this small Central American country named for the Savior, which John Paul II will visit as part of a trip beginning Monday that will also take him to Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
Perhaps more than any other recent development, the elevation of Bishop Saenz signals that the theology of liberation, the doctrine that has largely defined the character of the Roman Catholic Church in Latin America for more than a quarter of a century, has been forced into retreat. Wherever the Pope sets foot on his trip, he is likely to find a church divided along ideological lines and struggling to adapt to a new theological climate.
Across Latin America, dozens of activist bishops are being replaced by clerics who "toe the line very carefully on issues of doctrine, who you might say are yes-men" doing Rome's bidding, said the Rev. Joseph E. Mulligan, an American Jesuit who lives in Nicaragua and has written extensively on the church in Central America.
As a result, he added, the church is experiencing "a pulling back from the strong commitment to social justice and liberation that we saw in the 70's and 80's."
 
Mix of Catholic Dogma And Marxist Economics
The theology of liberation dates to the Second Vatican Council, which from 1962 through 1965 instituted reforms intended to make the Roman Catholic Church more dynamic in its service to "the people of God." As it has evolved over the years, liberation theology has blended Catholic teachings with Marxist economic analysis to provide the theoretical basis for what is called "a preferential option for the poor."
In practical terms, that has led to the creation of "ecclesiastical base communities" in which lay people and clergy analyze religious and political texts and seek to bring about social change. But adherents have clashed with governments throughout Latin America, and some members of base communities have, to the alarm of the Vatican and the local church hierarchy, joined left-wing guerrilla groups.
On his first visit to Central America, in March 1983, the Pope warned the supporters of liberation theology that they were going too far. In Managua, he publicly chastised the Rev. Ernesto Cardenal, a prominent liberation theology advocate who has since been suspended from the priesthood. The Pope was later jeered by leftist supporters of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, then in power in Nicaragua.
As a Pole who had long lived under Communism and worked to insure its fall, John Paul II was naturally suspicious of any school of theology that smacked of Marxism. But in the early years of his papacy, he also gave the Latin American church some leeway and showed himself willing to appoint bishops sympathetic to liberation theology, like Archbishop Romero's immediate successor, Arturo Rivera y Damas.
But over the last decade, the ranks of the liberal theologians have been thinned, at least at the more visible levels of the church hierarchy.
Some, like Jean-Bertrand Aristide in Haiti or the Rev. Fernando Cardenal in Nicaragua, a brother of the priest publicly criticized by the Pope, have been forced to leave the priesthood or resign from their orders.
Others, like six Jesuits who were taken from their residence here and executed by Salvadoran Army troops in 1989, have come to be regarded by many as martyrs.
The attrition has been stepped up by a process of favoring conservative bishops over those who identify with the theology of liberation.
"The fact is that the appointees are distant from social concerns and the Vatican is undergoing an ecclesiastical involution," said the Rev. Jon Sobrino, a Jesuit theologian who teaches at the University of Central America in San Salvador and is the author of books like "Jesus Christ, Liberator."
 
Purging 'Red' Clerics; Redefining 'the Poor'
Typical of the new generation is the 49-year-old Bishop of Esteli, Nicaragua, Abelardo Mata Guevara. In a recent interview with a Nicaraguan church publication, he spoke of "imposing order" after arriving in his diocese in 1988 and purging it of what he called "red clergy."
"Certain priests pushed the idea of a people's church, and thought the bridge for this people's church was in place in Esteli," he said. "They took Esteli as a laboratory for their pastoral experiments, which were nothing more than putting in practice the directives of the Sandinista Front."
A similar process has occurred in Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Colombia. As a result, the Latin American Episcopal Conference, the association of bishops that had twice endorsed the precepts of liberation theology at regional conferences, took a much less sympathetic stance when it last met, in the Dominican Republic in 1992.
With conservatives in control of more and more dioceses, the adherents of liberation theology have found it harder to operate. Bishops are reluctant to back them when disputes arise with civil authorities, there is less money available to support the programs they favor, and "radical" priests sometimes find themselves transferred from parishes where they have put down roots.
In an interview at his office here, Bishop Saenz said he had maintained "a close and sincere friendship" with Archbishop Romero. But he made no effort to mute his disagreement on doctrinal issues with followers of liberation theology who claim Archbishop Romero as their inspiration.
The theology of liberation is in reality based on "a Marxist rereading of the Gospel, with a tendency toward violence," said Bishop Saenz, who at the time of his appointment was an auxiliary to the Bishop of Santa Ana, El Salvador's second-largest city.
"Properly understood, the most orthodox and sound Catholic theology is the true theology of liberation," the new Archbishop said. "Jesus died for our sins, and if we free ourselves from sin, all injustices will disappear."
Furthermore, the "preferential option for the poor" endorsed at Vatican II has been subject to "a series of deviations," Bishop Saenz argued. It should not "transform the church into a church based on classes" nor "limit itself to an economic concept of the poor," but rather should seek to minister to all of those suffering from spiritual poverty, regardless of their social strata.
 
Rebuilding a Church: With Stones or Charity?
But the new Archbishop's critics here say he has gone too far in the other direction, cozying up to the Government, the upper class and the military. That marks a sharp break with the approach taken not only by Archbishop Romero, but also by his successor, Archbishop Arturo Rivera y Damas, and by Bishop Gregorio Rosa Chavez, who had been favored to succeed Archbishop Rivera y Damas, but was passed over.
"Under the three previous archbishops, we saw a separation of church and state," said the Rev. Miguel Ventura, a practitioner of liberation theology who spent much of El Salvador's civil war ministering to left-wing rebels. "Now we are surprised to see the hierarchy seek an alignment of the two."
To many in the church's "popular wing" here, the clearest symbol of that new relationship is Bishop Saenz's decision to resume construction of a Cathedral on a main downtown square here. Archbishop Romero is buried inside, but the structure had been left unfinished since his tenure because, as he once put it, "it is time to build the Church instead of building churches."
But Bishop Saenz has accepted more than $1 million for reconstruction from the Government, big businesses and wealthy families. That deeply offends many in the clergy, who say they can never forget that President Armando Calderon Sol is a member of the political party whose founder ordered the assassination of Archbishop Romero.
"This turnabout is scandalous, given the tradition of this Church," said one priest who considers himself a disciple of Archbishop Romero and spoke on condition that neither he nor his order be identified. "It is abhorrent and it is aberrant."
 
Pope Opts for TV Mass Over a Visit to a Grave
It is hardly surprising that the itinerary of the Pope's nine-hour visit here has also become the object of an intense struggle.
Advocates of liberation theology, as well as many other priests and lay people, want John Paul II to visit the grave of the six slain Jesuits, but Bishop Saenz said "technical reasons" make such a stop impossible.
Instead, the Pope is scheduled to pay a call on Mr. Calderon Sol and to celebrate a televised open-air Mass that is expected to draw one million people or more. "They are mounting a spectacle, as if it were the Rolling Stones or Michael Jackson who were coming," one priest complained.
No matter what the outcome of the papal visit, the advocates of liberation theology say they intend to continue their efforts here, working at the level of individual parishes and base communities. As they see it, the current situation of official hostility is just one more test of their faith.
"The true Church of God is going to have to bear this cross," Father Ventura said. "Christ too felt all of the temporal powers against him, but still managed to strengthen himself. So must we."

UNSHACKLING
Oh, Brave New World . . .
Call it the ultimate test of the benefits of competition. Congress finally sorted out its disagreements and passed a bill intended to promote a free-for-all among cable television and broadcasting companies, local and long-distance phone companies and who knows what from the realm of cyberspace. Each of them will be able to offer services now provided by the others. The bill's enthusiasts (only 16 members of the House and 5 senators voted against the bill) and the companies themselves say Americans will have more choices, and companies will compete through lower rates and better service. "We have broken up two of the biggest government monopolies left: local telephone service and cable TV," crowed Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of Virginia, who managed the bill through the House. Consumers Union, however, predicted that cable television rates would rise, and others worried about what impact the concentration of power in the broadcasting business would have on local ownership and program content.
 
DIGITAL COMMERCE
In the Name of Security
The fierce rivals Visa International and Mastercard made a rare agreement, and brought along to the peace table two battling software companies, Microsoft and the upstart Netscape. The glue that binds them all is a new technology called Secure Electronic Transactions, which, it is hoped, will mend holes in the pipeline of secure data transmission. The goal is to allow customers to transmit scrambled credit-card numbers to businesses in a way that shuts out snoopers.
 
M&A
A Week's Maneuvering
Baxter International offered $3.8 billion to W. R. Grace for its National Medical unit, which dominates the kidney dialysis market; Mattel abandoned its $5.2 billion bid for Hasbro after Hasbro refused to bargain, citing antitrust concerns, and I.B.M. agreed to pay $743 million for Tivoli Systems of Austin, Tex., a maker of software designed to keep client-server networks healthy.
 
THE ECONOMY
Once More, a Rate Cut
For the second time in six weeks, the Federal Reserve moved to stimulate the economy by nudging down interest rates. The decision to cut by a quarter point the Federal funds rate, to 5.25 percent, and the discount rate, to 5 percent, is likely to ripple through the economy, nudging down the rates charged for corporate borrowing, home mortgages, auto loans and more. And the data showing that economic growth is slowing continue to pile up: the Commerce Department reported that consumer prices rose just 2.5 percent in 1995, the lowest rate in nearly a decade, while the Labor Department reported that nonfarm payroll jobs fell by 201,000 and the unemployment rate rose to 5.8 percent. It all provided fuel for those who criticized the Fed's decision to raise interest rates seven times in 1994-95. Did stomping inflation, they ask, kick the economy in the ribs?
 
INQUIRIES
Study of Milken Intensifies
Taking its investigation of Michael R. Milken, the former junk-bond king, to a new level, the Securities and Exchange Commission assumed subpoena powers, which enable it to compel people to be interviewed and to produce documents. The agency is trying to determine if Mr. Milken, who pleaded guilty in 1990 to securities-law violations, breached an April 1990 order by advising Ted Turner, Rupert Murdoch, Ronald O. Perelman and MCI Communications on recent deals. A lawyer for Mr. Milken described the S.E.C. action as a routine step toward completing its investigation.
 
MUSIC
Standing at the Altar
How important are awards to the performers who generate very substantial revenues for the recording industry? Last week at the American Music Awards, which were created by Dick Clark 25 years ago and poll "a representative sample of record buyers" to pick the winners, Garth Brooks declined the top award of performer of the year. "I can't agree with this," he told the audience, then walked offstage, leaving behind the award.
 
THE NEWS BUSINESS
Is Four a Crowd?
Rupert Murdoch joined the bettors who think either that CNN is vulnerable or the audience can be greatly expanded. Mr. Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation and Fox Inc., announced plans for a 24-hour cable news service and hired Roger Ailes to run it. NBC and ABC previously announced plans for all-news services. Some people speculated that Mr. Murdoch was positioning himself for a long-term attempt to provide news on demand, an audience now being tested by the on-line services.

RETAILING
Another Chain Goes Under
Two years after it filed for bankruptcy protection, Merry-Go-Round Enterprises decided to liquidate. All its 536 stores will be shut. The company's management said it would no longer persuade vendors to keep up shipments and financial houses to provide more money to stay afloat. Another apparel chain, Today's Man, filed for bankruptcy protection.
 
NO-SHOWS
Hold That Table!
American Express has been experimenting with a service that imposes a fee on people who make a restaurant reservation and fail to show up. A handful of restaurants are testing the program, imposing a fee of $10 to $25 for each unused reservation, and they say it has sharply reduced no-shows.
 
HEALTH CARE
Cost Rise Again
The cost of employee health are climbed in 1995 and is continuing to rise this year, two surveys of businesses found after a dip in 1994. The increase reflects the higher cost of traditional insurance, the increased demand for new and expensive tests and the number of older and retired employees. The cost of care provided by managed-care networks fell for the first time.
 
PERSONAL COMPUTERS
An Antidote to Clutter
Compaq Computer retained first place among marketers of personal computers, and also rolled out a truly unusual option for PC's: a keyboard with a built-in scanner. The device, which takes up far less desk space than a typical scanner, is included with the Presario model 7232 ($2,199 without monitor) and is a $349 option on 10 other Compaq models. Based on scanner technology licensed from Visioneer, the keyboard will be sold for use with other companies' computers later this year.
 
TRAVEL
Afloat on the Road
The repressive military Government of Myanmar, formerly Burma, which took control in 1988, has not deterred Venice Simplon-Orient-Express Ltd., best known for its luxury train travel, to initiate a new luxury service. The 120-berth cruise ship Road to Mandalay sits in the Irrawaddy River at Pagan, from which it carries passengers to Mandalay and back. (Photo: Business Wire)

HEADLINE: Coming to a Theater Near You: the Latest Format War

BYLINE: By LAURIE FLYNN 

 BODY:
For movie theater owners, the digital revolution is proving anything but peaceful.
Digital sound systems are bringing resonance and clarity of the quality of compact disks to movies, making it possible to hear the quiet desperation in Oliver Stone's "Nixon" and the gritty mayhem of Martin Scorsese's "Casino." One in five American cinemas is now equipped to play digital soundtracks, and new theaters are being outfitted weekly. 
 The trouble for theater owners is that competing audio formats means that the digital equipment used for a film that drops audiences in the middle of an antiwar demonstration is not the same hardware used to imbue a soundtrack with the chaos of 1970's Las Vegas life.
Three companies -- the Sony Corporation, Dolby Laboratories Inc. and an upstart called Digital Theater Systems Inc. -- are battling to become the preeminent digital standard for movie soundtracks.
And with one system for a single screen costing as much as $11,000, "the competition is very strenuous," said James Fiedler, the president of Sony Dynamic Digital Sound of Culver City, Calif.
Digital Theater, or D.T.S., has its system in the most theaters, but no guarantee that its lead is more than temporary. So some exhibitors are gambling on one technology to eventually triumph over the others.
"Ultimately, one of the formats will win and the other equipment we have bought will be for naught," said Howard Lichtman, an executive vice president of Cineplex-Odeon Theaters, the Toronto company that operates one of North America's largest theater chains. "It's very difficult when you know some of your money will go out the window."
A few ambitious exhibitors, not wanting to risk an inability to screen the next box-office hit in its full aural glory, have armed themselves for all possibilities by cramming projection booths with the three competing types of digital sound systems.
"Theater owners that play movies from all the major studios have to buy equipment from all of us," said Bill Neighbors, vice president and general manager of D.T.S.
Four years ago, "Batman Returns" introduced moviegoers to digital theater audio with a Dolby Digital soundtrack. Since then, theater owners have not been the only ones grappling with the problem.
Film makers must also choose which format to use, in hopes of assuring that their films can play in the greatest number of digitally equipped movie houses. And to insure that the films can be played in the far larger number of movie houses that still use conventional sound systems -- converted screens remain just a fraction of the 25,000 theaters in the United States alone -- all movies must also include an analog track.
With digital audio, a sound is translated into computer code for precise recording and playback. The less precise analog audio technology uses an optical pattern along the edge of the film, in which flashes of light corresponding to actual sound waves are played back by the theater's speaker system.
Since the first "talkie" -- Al Jolson in "The Jazz Singer" in 1927 -- movie sound has generally lagged well behind improvements in color and special effects. But with advances in digital sound, moviegoers can now hear the trampling of rhinoceroses in "Jumanji" and the whistling of the wind in "Pocohantas" with all the clarity and crispness that the films' sound engineers intended.
The development represents a leap in sound quality similar to that delivered to home stereo systems when the CD replaced magnetic tapes and vinyl LP's. Dolby, which introduced stereo sound to theaters 20 years ago, had the advantage of being first with a digital system. But the company soon found that even this edge, and its brand recognition, did not assure market dominance.
In 1993, D.T.S., a company based in Westlake Village, Calif., with financial backing from the film director Steven Spielberg and the MCA/Universal studios, introduced a competing format with the release of Mr. Spielberg's "Jurassic Park."
Many other film makers apparently agreed with Mr. Spielberg's assessment that D.T.S. delivered audio superior to Dolby's. Today, D.T.S. has triple the presence in North America, with 3,305 screens to Dolby's 1,004 -- though Dolby has a greater hold on the international market, with 2,295 screens to D.T.S.'s 1,895.
But D.T.S. is hardly secure. In June 1994, Sony, the parent of Columbia Pictures and Tristar, introduced Sony Dynamic Digital Sound, or S.D.D.S. Despite its late entry into field, Sony's system has managed to gain considerable momentum, with the system installed at 1,502 screens in North America in just 18 months.
Exhibitors and at least some studios hope that one format prevails soon. With a system for a single screen costing from $5,900 to $11,000, buying more than one format for each screen can cost a theater multiplex tens of thousands of extra dollars. For studios, the cost of making a film playable in more than one digital format is smaller, though not insignificant, involving more mixing time and licensing fees.
"This whole industry is still searching for what's going to be 'it,' " said Alan Stokes, vice president of marketing for Metropolitan Theaters, a chain of 130 theaters in Southern California. "The problem is when certain film companies have allegiances to certain sound formats, and you want to be able to play the big films while at the same time keeping an eye on the economics."
Many films today are still produce with just an analog soundtrack, but the trend among many film makers is to introduce pictures in more than one format, sometimes in all three, despite the higher costs.
"Waiting to Exhale," for example, was produced in all three formats to give the movie the largest possible base of potential theaters. "Grumpier Old Men," was released only in Dolby and the Sony system.
In 1995, 67 movies were released in D.T.S. format, 76 in the Sony format and 122 in Dolby Digital. That includes films released in more than one format.
Not everyone cares which format wins in the end. Bruce Marko, a spokesman for MGM/UA, whose releases with digital soundtracks last year included "Get Shorty" and "Leaving Las Vegas," contends that any difference in quality among the formats is imperceptible to the typical moviegoer. A year and a half ago, MGM/UA struck a deal with D.T.S. to release all its films only in that format, but Mr. Marko said that the studio would re-evaluate the market when the contract expires.
"Some people feel one sounds better than another, but I disagree; they all give an enhanced experience," he said. "The technical differences between them are much less than the acoustical differences from theater to theater. The average audience would never be able to tell."


GRAPHIC: There are three systems for digital sound for theaters. Two have the digital signal on the film and the third has the signal on a separate CD-ROM. Traditional four-channel analog sound remains unchanged in each format.

HEADLINE: Media Business Now a Job Fair For Executives Once Removed

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER with GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
For someone who was just thrown out of work, Frank J. Biondi Jr. certainly acts like a busy man. On Thursday, two weeks after he was ousted as the president and chief executive of Viacom Inc., Mr. Biondi raced from one meeting to another before heading to a going-away party at La Grenouille, the venerable midtown restaurant, where his former colleagues toasted him over a lavish dinner of ravioli with lobster and rack of lamb.
"The only difference between this and working," he said in an interview at his temporary offices, "is that people used to come and see me. Now, I go to see them." 
 Mr. Biondi is the newest member of an elite but growing fraternity: top media executives who have been dismissed by their companies and have not yet landed another corporate perch. In the last six months, Viacom, Time Warner, Sony and MCA have all forced out top executives. Time Warner has dismissed the chairmen of two of its five divisions within the last year.
Executives and headhunters said that Mr. Biondi and his unemployed colleagues are the visible products of a wave of anxiety that is sweeping media companies, as consolidation creates a handful of giants and technological change forces relentless questioning of corporate strategy.
The intense coverage of the industry in the news media has added to the instability by turning even divisional executives into celebrities. Like the managers of professional sports teams, media executives now play out their problems under a spotlight, making simple disputes potentially explosive.
"This industry is more volatile and fast paced than most," said Gerard R. Roche, the chairman of Heidrick & Struggles, an executive recruiting firm. "That breeds restlessness on the part of boards and C.E.O.'s."
With Mr. Biondi and others looking for work, the media industry these days has taken on the characteristics of an elaborate job fair. Among the dismissed are Michael J. Fuchs, the former chairman of Home Box Office; Michael P. Schulhof, the former president of the Sony Corporation of America; Al Teller, the former chairman of MCA Music, and Richard E. Snyder, the former chairman of Simon & Schuster, Viacom's publishing unit.
Executives familiar with MCA said Mr. Biondi had lunch in Los Angeles last week with Edgar Bronfman Jr., the new owner of MCA, to explore Mr. Biondi's interest in becoming chief executive of that company. Mr. Fuchs was rumored to be a candidate for the top job at CBS, recently taken over by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, while Mr. Teller's name came up in industry speculation about a senior job at Sony Music Entertainment.
None of these rumors has proved true yet -- which may indicate that it is easier to get fired than hired in today's media industry. Indeed, Mr. Biondi, Mr. Fuchs and Mr. Teller were all producing solid results at their respective companies before they were forced out.
In dismissing Mr. Biondi, Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman of Viacom, said he believed the company needed to move more aggressively into overseas markets. Although Viacom has already become an $11 billion behemoth through its acquisitions of Paramount Communications and Blockbuster Entertainment, executives close to Mr. Redstone said that he was concerned that he was falling behind another billionaire, Rupert Murdoch, in the race for dominance of the global media marketplace.
Few industry executives hold Mr. Biondi responsible for Viacom's supposed sluggishness. Indeed, several headhunters said that Mr. Biondi's skills as a professional manager would make him more attractive to prospective employers than some of his out-of-work colleagues.
"Frank is the hottest of these guys," said Bill Simon, the managing director of the worldwide entertainment and media division at Korn Ferry in Los Angeles. "He lets the managers run their own businesses. He is also able to deal with the talent side."
The trouble is, as the executives have received more publicity, the line between managers and talent has blurred. People close to Viacom said that relations between Mr. Biondi and Mr. Redstone chilled noticeably after The New Yorker magazine published a lengthy profile of Mr. Biondi in 1994. Mr. Redstone complained to several people that Mr. Biondi had received too much credit for various Viacom deals, including its acquisition of Blockbuster and its sale of cable systems to Tele-Communications Inc.
"The publicity that anyone else got was of no concern to me," Mr. Redstone said yesterday. Then he added: "The fact is, the actual deals were made by me."
Robert J. Morgado, the former chairman of Time Warner's music division, who was ousted last May in a highly publicized power struggle with other music executives, said, "Making decisions in the vortex of such attention sometimes drives people to act perversely."
Mr. Morgado said that as the companies have grown, more of them were falling under the control of a single powerful leader, determined to operate the company like a proprietor. Mr. Redstone often refers to Mr. Murdoch, the News Corporation chairman and the prototypical proprietor, as his model of a chief executive.
Some executives are victims of the proprietor's desire for change. Mr. Teller lost his job at MCA shortly after the Seagram Company, which is controlled by Mr. Bronfman's family, took it over.
Even when they are not the biggest shareholders, some bosses are behaving more like owners. This is partly because the boards of media companies have become more pliable, said several industry experts.
At Time Warner, Mr. Fuchs was dismissed by the chairman, Gerald M. Levin, in a revamping that came on the heels of Time Warner's agreement to acquire the Turner Broadcasting System. In 19 years at HBO, Mr. Fuchs had turned the premium cable channel into a profitable global company. But executives familiar with Time Warner said that Mr. Fuchs opposed the Turner deal. That set him on a collision course with Mr. Levin, who later reorganized Time Warner so that Mr. Fuchs no longer had a place in it.
If Mr. Fuchs and his colleagues tire of searching for their next jobs, they can look to Mr. Morgado for an example of how one can seize the opportunity to chart an entirely new course.
After he was dismissed by Mr. Levin, Mr. Morgado took the estimated $60 million he received in severance from Time Warner and used it to finance a new charitable foundation and a media investment firm.
"What Jerry did was give me my next life, three years early," Mr. Morgado said with a smile, "and he underwrote the transition."

HEADLINE: The Wealthy Town That Has Fostered Forbes
<HEADLINE>Where Less Government Is the Rule

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

DATELINE: BEDMINSTER, N.J.

 BODY:
When Steve Forbes, on the Presidential campaign trail, talks about shrinking the government, his neighbors know where he's coming from: a private and pristine pocket of the country where government still knows its place.
Government's place here is a modest one. There is no municipal garbage collection; it is all done privately. As for water and sewer service, many families have their own wells and septic tanks. The fire and emergency squads are volunteer. When the town needed a library, it turned not to government but to citizens with dynastic names like Forbes and Merck. 
 Even the Department of Public Works is deferential. It posts the schedule for the Essex Fox Hounds on its bulletin board -- so road crews can stay out of the hunt's way and not frighten the horses.
In this election year, Bedminster is Forbes country. But it is not, perhaps, the most typical of American towns. It has produced more than its share of secretaries of the treasury. And it is not unheard of for girls headed to boarding school to take their horses with them.
Horse farms make up most of Bedminster's 27 square miles. Families have lived here for generations, attending the same colleges, going into the same businesses, occasionally marrying into one another.
Bedminster and four neighboring Somerset County towns are known collectively as "the Somerset Hills," and the roster of residents reads like the Social Register cross-indexed to a textbook of American economic history.
There is Mr. Forbes's family, of publishing fame; various heirs to the Mellon banking and Mars candy fortunes; John Z. DeLorean, the former auto maker, and descendants of founders of pharmaceutical-industry giants like Johnson & Johnson and Merck.
There's Jane Engelhard, the widow of Charles Engelhard, the platinum king. Jacqueline Onassis had a farm in the area. There's Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, former Gov. Thomas Kean and King Hassan II of Morocco.
Nicholas F. Brady, Treasury Secretary under President George Bush, lived here until recently. So did C. Douglas Dillon, another former Treasury Secretary and former chairman of the Wall Street investment firm of Dillon, Read & Company.
About an hour from New York City, most of Bedminster is still rural, and people work to keep it that way. About 80 percent of the township is zoned for private lots of 10 acres. The town spent a decade in court trying to defend its zoning against the charge that it discriminated against lower-income people. A developer argued, successfully, that New Jersey law required the township to change its zoning to allow construction of at least some "affordable" housing.
What has resulted is a kind of town within a town -- The Hills, 3,300 condominium units scrambling up the side of Schley Mountain, relatively packed at the rate of 10 units an acre into a corner of Bedminster. A town house begins in the $160,000 range; three- to five-bedroom homes are in the $400,000 range. Among them, 620 are earmarked for low- and moderate-income people.
Along with the development has come a shopping center, a fancy supermarket, a bookstore that sells "The Somerset Hills Landed Gentry Map." At night, the glow of hundreds of ersatz antique street lamps can be seen for miles around.
The development more than doubled Bedminster's population, to 7,800. So the police force has doubled, and the township has had to build a new school and make baseball fields out of open land.
Yet much remains the same. Seventeen miles of township roads are deliberately kept unpaved, dirt or gravel. The residents of Bedminster, and their horses, prefer it that way.
On most Saturdays, Sundays and holidays between Labor Day and Easter, the Tewksbury Foot Bassetts -- "foot," in this case, because the followers are not on horseback -- still roam the countryside pursuing the descendants of hares brought from Europe 100 years ago.
"It's amazing how little Bedminster Township has changed," said John Schley, whose family has been there as long as the hare. "When I drive through, it still appears to be the place I knew in the mid-1940's."
The campaign trail runs smack through the center of Bedminster. Store windows display "Forbes for President" signs. Bumper stickers and buttons abound. Locals lick envelopes at campaign headquarters in the middle of town.
Many people here say without hesitation that they support Mr. Forbes. Many know him, or his family, and like what they know. But many also say they like his ideas, that his brand of Republican thinking is their own.
Many say they are excited by the notion of a flat tax, though some are skeptical that it could be as simple as Mr. Forbes says it is. But even they seemed to be extending to Mr. Forbes the benefit of the doubt.
"Certainly, the old tax system is appalling," said Alice W. Lorillard, 76, who lives on an 80-acre farm and rides twice a week. "I think the capital gains taxes are too high and the inheritance taxes are absolutely ludicrous."
Others said they would welcome a businessman as President. They said they doubted that voters cared that Mr. Forbes has money. Many said they were not at all concerned that Mr. Forbes has never held elective office.
"Steve Forbes's views reflect, to a great degree, the views of people in our area," said Dean D. Porter, a corporate lawyer and father of five. "These are people who don't look to the government for help."
Many of their families first came to the area in the late 19th century, when wealthy Wall Street types started buying up small farms in the Somerset Hills and piecing together vast weekend and summer estates.
For 60 years, the area remained an almost private domain. But in the 1960's, two interstate highways came through -- I-78 running east-west, I-287 running north-south, intersecting in Bedminster.
Then AT&T, outgrowing its offices in lower Manhattan, moved into the area. It opened its headquarters in Basking Ridge in 1975, a division in Bedminster in 1977 and another office in neighboring Bridgewater in 1985.
Other companies followed, bringing thousands of employees with them. As land values rose, it became increasingly expensive to hold on to large tracts. Families began selling off pieces and were not always able to control how the land was used.
Kenneth B. Schley Jr. sold land on Schley Mountain to a group that he says intended to build a private recreation center. But the group couldn't find backing and the land tumbled into other developers' hands.
"I had no intention of selling it to the people who bought it," said Mr. Schley, now 78, who watched his grandfather's land become the development known as The Hills. "I feel terribly. But I don't feel it was my responsibility."
Fourteen years after the first house went up in The Hills, construction continues. For the last several years, the job of managing the development has fallen to a man from a family that has lived in the area for four generations.
Sitting in his office on the second-floor of the mall, Thomas H. Dillon pointed out that he had not been involved at the beginning. But he said he had long believed that growth in the area was inevitable.
"A lot of people think The Hills are a strain on local services and an intrusion into a way of life," Mr. Dillon, who is 43, said. "There were people that said, 'How can you do this in the area you're from?' "
Bedminster has never been a place that lavished money on public services. In a county with one of the highest average per capita incomes in the country, the township has prided itself on keeping taxes low.
In addition to the absence of municipal garbage collection and the like, the library is shared with neighboring Far Hills. The township has also signed several dozen agreements to share the cost of other services with its neighbors. For example, a half-dozen communities share a single public health department, a service required by the state.
And when George Mantz retired from the township's Department of Public Works on Dec. 31, there were six department employees -- just as there had been when he first went to work there 33 years before.
"I call it minimalization of services," said Joseph H. Metelski, a former Bedminster mayor. Mr. Metelski said it took him four years in the 1970's to persuade the township to convert his private street into a public road.
So it has not been easy for Bedminster to accommodate The Hills -- even though the development itself maintains nearly all of its streets and arranges privately for sewage treatment.
In fact, the question of whether to convert some township land into athletic fields proved so controversial last year that it became a campaign issue and helped cause an upheaval on the Township Committee.
"Local politics in Bedminster is a very closely followed event," said Mr. Dillon, who, like most people in the township, votes Republican.
Oddly enough, both sides of Bedminster seem to support Mr. Forbes.
Elizabeth Merck, who has a horse farm and spent 15 years on the Township Committee, said: "It would be a real treat to have someone who is not just a politician. And I say that having been 'just a politician' myself."
David Weiss, who is 22 and lives with his family in The Hills development, said he admired Mr. Forbes for using his fortune to get his views across to the public in defiance of what Mr. Weiss described as a closed political system.
One township resident, however, had little good to say about Mr. Forbes. G. Daniel Walker, president of the Somerset Airport, said he resented that Mr. Forbes, among others, had opposed his plans to improve his airport.
Mr. Forbes owns land adjoining the airport, a so-called private public-use airport started by Mr. Walker's father, George, 50 years ago. Mr. Forbes also lives near the airport, across Burnt Mills Road.
Though many people in town say they believe Mr. Walker's intention has been to expand the airport's operations, he says he only wants to improve it. He says the opposition has cost him thousands of dollars for permits and legal fees.
"He doesn't have ideas that I think are workable," Mr. Walker said of Mr. Forbes. "Like the flat tax. I don't think it's ever going to go through. It's a bag of wind."
But last week, Mr. Walker appeared to be in the minority in Bedminster.
Joseph B. Wiley Jr., a joint master of the Tewksbury Foot Bassetts and a retired engineer, recalled a recent conversation with an acquaintance who learned that Mr. Wiley was from Mr. Forbes's home town.
"He said, 'What makes him think anyone's going to vote for him for President?' " Mr. Wiley recalled. "I said, 'Last time I was in the post office, everyone was in favor.' "

Beware Smilo-Communism

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland

 BODY:
"Look at those businessmen dancing around that Communist," said an unemployed Russian at the World Economic Forum held at this ski resort every year. "Don't they realize he will doom their investments?"
Center of the executive fandango is the global man of the hour, Gennadi Zyuganov, who led the Communist Party to its victory in the parliamentary elections, and who now leads in the race for president of Russia scheduled for June. 
 A recent poll shows Zyuganov (accent on the "gan") ahead with 14 percent, trailed by the democrat Yavlinsky at 11, the fascist Zhirinovsky at 7, the military Lebed at 6 and incumbent Yeltsin at 5, with half the population too chilled to choose.
The balding, 51-year-old former mathematician and philosopher -- solid in private but stolid in public -- is here on a heavy-handed charm offensive, eager to show the West it has nothing to fear from resurgent Communism and thereby persuade Russians that his election would not dry up foreign investment. I caught him early Sunday morning just before he set out to work over George Soros.
If Communists take over, what becomes of newly freed markets in Russia? "We want a mixed economy, a stable balance of public, private and collective ownership. Privatization in the U.S. took a hundred years [sic] and ours took place in two years, which is barbarian. But what happened, happened -- if we turned back suddenly, all Russia would be in flames. If an enterprise is productive, and if collective rights are preserved, let it flourish."
That sounds like sweet reason, but when pressed Zyuganov made plain that the clock would be turned back: "The state should control basic industries, energy, railroads, defense production, education, medical care."
What about the robust free press, which says anything it likes while Yeltsin does anything he likes? That draws a chuckle from today's Communist boss: "We will insure the right of all legally recognized organizations to have access to the media. The previous muzzle on the media by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was fruitless."
Thus, government would order the media to print or broadcast officially "recognized" views. Would he purge and punish current and past leadership, as those around Yeltsin and other opponents fear?
"No. A purge is a dead-end street, a nightmare," he said reassuringly. "We will evaluate people by results, not by ideological beliefs."
The word is that Zyuganov is the nice-guy Menshevik, who would be pushed aside by the hard-line Bolsheviks soon after the Communists gained power. Not so, he smiled: "Communists agree that our candidate should present a program aimed at the whole population, not just at Communist followers: good jobs, respect to the elderly, education and medical care, personal and state security. A president must be leader of the whole nation."
Soothing answers are the name of his game. Even when talking at home about "integrating" the freed former Soviet republics, reconquest dear to nationalist hearts, he inserts the word "voluntary" for foreign consumption. Does he really expect Ukraine to "voluntarily" rejoin Russia? "We have no claims on the political sovereignty of Ukraine. Life itself will define the face of the new unity.
"This is not about conquering the world. Communism, in my interpretation, means collegiality, sustainable development, spiritual values, major investment in the human being."
His message: Relax. The only anger he showed was about the gathering of a million signatures from at least 15 regions to qualify for the coming election. Communists, with legions of loyal pensioners, are set to do that; to a lesser extent, so are democrats. Zhirinovsky will have to pay collectors, his money suspected as coming from Yeltsin, who wants to face him rather than Zyuganov in the runoff. But Yeltsin has his own cost-free signature-gathering technique: no pay to government workers until they sign.
"This is rampant, outrageous illegality," Zyuganov flashed. "The Duma has sent this to the prosecutors."
He then reached for the hot button of American hard-liners: "Nixon was able to conduct relations irrespective of ideological differences. I like that kind of conservative."
Smooth pitch from a well-briefed politician. No sale.

Sliding Pay Scale

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The buying power of the Federal minimum wage will soon reach its lowest level since 1955, when the minimum wage was 75 cents an hour.
Minimum-wage workers currently make $4.25 an hour, which is $170 for a 40-hour week. That enables them to live like peons. There are free marketeers who say they shouldn't even be guaranteed that much. The House majority leader, Dick Armey, a robust fellow who hasn't missed a meal in a long time, would like to get rid of the minimum wage altogether. With that trap door yanked open, he would offer tax benefits to those who fell through. 
 It has been a year since President Clinton proposed a modest 90-cent-an-hour increase in the minimum wage. The increase would come in two increments -- 45 cents immediately and another 45 cents a year later. It is not exactly a radical proposal and it has overwhelming public support. But it has gone nowhere. The Dick Armeys of the world have said "nyet."
Over lunch a few days ago, Labor Secretary Robert Reich cited the importance of even a modest wage increase to the families of low-wage workers. If President Clinton's proposal had been approved last summer, the $525 in additional wages could have provided food for three months, or 10 months worth of electric bills, or new clothing for several children.
Nearly 60 percent of the workers who would benefit from a minimum-wage increase are women. Nearly two-thirds are adults struggling to support families, as opposed to the stereotype of a teen-ager flipping hamburgers after school for movie money and other non-essentials.
Most minimum-wage workers lead very difficult lives. They skip meals. They defer medical care. They dream about vacations they can never afford to take.
"It is fundamentally immoral to expect people to work full time for $8,600 a year," said Secretary Reich.
An "additional level of absurdity" is reached, he said, by those who want to move large numbers of people off welfare but do not want to do anything about the sinking value of the minimum wage.
It has been nearly seven years since the minimum wage was increased. When that proposal was being debated, Bob Dole criticized those who were clamoring for a cut in the capital-gains tax while opposing the minimum-wage legislation. Said Mr. Dole, "I never thought the Republican Party should stand for squeezing every last nickel from the minimum wage."
Congress went on to vote overwhelmingly in favor of an increase of 90 cents, to $4.25 an hour. But much of that increase has already been eroded by inflation.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has prepared a chart that traces the value of the minimum wage, in 1995 dollars, since 1955. The 75-cent-an-hour minimum in 1955 was worth $3.92 in 1995 dollars. In 1956 the minimum was raised to $1 an hour, bringing its value to $5.14. In 1968 the $1.60 minimum wage was worth $6.45.
By 1983 the minimum was up to $3.35, but its value in '95 dollars had slipped to $5.11 and was heading steadily lower. By 1989, still at $3.35, it was worth just $4.11. Unless Congress steps in, the value of the minimum wage in 1995 dollars will soon slip below $4 an hour.
There are two basic arguments against raising the minimum wage. The first is ideological. The most fervent worshipers of the free market believe government should not interfere at all in the affairs of business. If that idea were pushed to its extreme, there would be no minimum wage, no workplace safety or environmental protection regulations, no prohibitions against child labor.
The other argument is practical. Opponents of an increase in the minimum wage say it would cost jobs, thus hurting the very people who are supposed to be helped. Secretary Reich counters that argument with a series of studies that have shown no such impact. Modest minimum-wage increases do not cost jobs.
On Saturday President Clinton repeated his call for an increase, a minor wage adjustment that would keep the purchasing power of hard-working men and women from sliding to a 40-year low.

If not for a few campaign banners and a box of blue "Forbes for President" buttons, it would have been hard to tell whether it was a campaign rally or halftime at a high school basketball game.
But there were elements of both today when Steve Forbes returned to his home county to receive the endorsement of local Republicans. Between 200 and 300 people, many casually dressed families with small children, crowded into the Somerset County Administration Building to see Mr. Forbes's first political rally in New Jersey. 
 Although the Forbes family has been well known here for years, Mr. Forbes's surge in the polls has brought him increased notice.
"I like his tax proposal," said Art Tropiano, 80, who owns a jewelry store. "He's a young guy, 48 years old. The big issue about Dole is his age. The thing is that the President can't do that much in one term, so he has got to be young enough to serve two."
The crowd cheered and flapped blue cardboard "Forbes for President" banners when the candidate entered. Meg Florio, 7, daughter of the county Republican chairman, presented Forbes with a small Somerset County commemorative pin in the shape of a balloon. "I promised to be here today so when the reporters ask you what I was like when I was a wee bit smaller, you will say nice things," Mr. Forbes told the crowd.
The crowd responded to Mr. Forbes's call for lower taxes and less government, applauding his repeated criticism of "our friends from Washington."
Mr. Forbes's insistence that economic issues should be the heart of this year's campaign drew the most support.
Tom Kotarsky, a draftsman who was laid off after 27 years with the Unisys Corporation, agreed.
"I hear President Clinton saying there are eight million new jobs, but I don't see the jobs they are talking about," said Mr. Kotarsky, who described himself as a lifelong Republican rather than a Forbes supporter. "What we need is for industry to put people to work. Let's see the statistics on how they will do that."

HEADLINE: Forbes's Positions Found in Early Writings

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

DATELINE: SIOUX CITY, Iowa, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Contrary to the impression left by his speeches and his television ads, Steve Forbes's flat-tax plan is not the only mantra that throws this Republican Presidential candidate into overdrive. Advocating Congressional term limits gets his adrenaline flowing, too.
"Term limits would break the grip of lawyers," he says. "People from different walks of life who don't wish to spend all their professional lives in politics could still serve effectively." 
 This particular version of his term-limits rationale is not Forbes Nouveau. It is, rather, vintage Forbes -- straight from the Nov. 9, 1992, Fact and Comment section of the business magazine that bears his family name and where, as editor-in-chief, he has opined for years.
When he gives a stump speech these days, Mr. Forbes flags his support for term limits. In fact, many issues he now mentions, as part of a deliberate strategy to show off a broader political portfolio, are riffs on his positions in the pages of Forbes. In effect, Fact and Comment is a de facto briefing book on what and how the magazine mogul thinks today.
While his candidacy until now has been largely defined by his laser-like emphasis on his 17 percent flat-tax plan, Mr. Forbes in recent days has been reminding voters that he has positions on a wide range of issues and causes. "We have a whole program, a number of ideas," he said in a recent campaign stop in Iowa, inviting questioners to ask him about something other than the flat tax.
The compendium of views Mr. Forbes is now reciting on the stump, like those he has been rehearsing in the magazine, reflect a variety of influences. On economics, he is bullish on supply-side theory and committed to reviving Ronald Reagan's upbeat, low-tax approach. So he is not only telling voters that he now wants to abolish the current graduated income tax system in favor of a single flat tax, but he also campaigns on issues like tying the value of the dollar to the price of gold, and eliminating the capital gains and inheritance taxes.
Mr. Forbes says he is interested in balancing the budget but thinks there is an overemphasis on bringing down the deficit. Instead, he promotes lowering taxes as a way to spur growth in the economy.
On social issues, Mr. Forbes's positions often parallel the so-called compassionate conservatism of Empower America, a Washington-based idea factory. The group serves as a base for Jack Kemp, the former Housing Secretary and an advocate of supply-side economics, who is committed to helping the inner-city poor, and for William Bennett, the Education Secretary in the Bush Administration, who now writes on family values and culture.
As a result, Mr. Forbes supports providing vouchers to parents, so they can send their children to the public or private secondary school of their choice. He also favors greater involvement by religious and nonprofit organizations rather than having the Government run programs for the poor.
But he does toe a tough line on crime, arguing, for example, that first-time violent offenders should serve their entire sentence, instead of being eligible for parole.
Mr. Forbes's foreign policy positions reflect an excitement about the power of high technology, an opposition to isolationism and a commitment to promoting freer political and economic institutions in other nations. In recent campaign appearances, he has warned against the nation turning inward as it did in the 1930's, and has strongly advocated a continuing American commitment to the defense of western Europe and democracy in the Far East and Asia.
On the campaign trail in Iowa last week, Mr. Forbes said: "It's still a dangerous world even though the cold war is over. We must stay involved. We have been a stabilizing influence."
Many of Mr. Forbes's ideas and arguments on the stump these days got their first airing in his columns. For example, he first took issue with what he described as the isolationist politics of Patrick J. Buchanan, one of his current rivals, in a column that appeared in March 1992.
On the stump, there usually is not a lot of ideological daylight between Mr. Forbes, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and their rivals. Like so many others, Mr. Forbes wants to reduce the size of the Federal Government, end race-based quotas, create "taking" legislation to compensate those whose property values drop because of environmental and other regulations, use vouchers to give parents a chance to send a child to a private school, set term limits, cap welfare benefits while making work a requirement.
Mr. Forbes is never strident about hot-button issues. He wants abortion "to vanish in America" but says that will be an incremental process. He has found some of his party's rhetoric about immigration divisive.
Michael Novak, Mr. Forbes's friend and a theologian at the American Enterprise Institute, says he believes the candidate's philosophy reflects the distant influence of the Scottish Enlightenment, an eclectic, 18th century intellectual movement that emphasized a kind of civic humanism. Among other things, the movement, whose adherents included Adam Smith, sought to preserve individual liberty in the face of the state, including limiting the state's authority to tax.
"Steve doesn't talk about this," Mr. Novak said. But factoring in the influence of the Scots' old-fashioned form of liberalism and freedom from government, helps illuminate how Mr. Forbes thinks, Mr. Novak believes. Both served on the Board for International Broadcasting, which oversees Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty.
"The economic system that allows individuals to make decisions that bring out the best in them" is always what his friend is drawn to, Mr. Novak said.
Mr. Forbes's economic and political thinking has also been strongly influenced by Friedrich von Hayek, the economist and author of "The Road to Serfdom," the 1944 work that helped sharpen conservative thinking about limiting the role of government in peoples' lives.
But Paul R. Krugman, a Stanford University economics professor and author of "Peddling Prosperity: Economic Sense and Nonsense in an Age of Diminished Expectations," takes a far dimmer view of Mr. Forbes's economic theology.
"The point is, he's a crank," said Mr. Krugman, who says that Mr. Forbes is weak on basic economics, and is, in essence, recycling shopworn 1980's supply-side views. "So this is once again crank economics posing as economic expertise," said Mr. Krugman, who said that Mr. Forbes's ability to talk "like a nerd" tends to create the impression that he knows what he is talking about.
William Kristol, a conservative theorist, who is editor and publisher of The Weekly Standard, said in an interview that Mr. Forbes's candidacy "is Kemp plus Perot and that proves to be a potent combination." He gives Mr. Forbes credit for blending the sentiments that fueled Perot to 19 percent of the 1992 vote with the impulses that helped Republicans take control of Congress in 1994.
In an editorial in the weekly's new edition, Mr. Kristol and John Podhoretz, the deputy editor, bemoan the decision by Mr. Bennett, Mr. Kemp and others to sit out 1996. While the editorial has great respect for Mr. Forbes and his ability to exploit the field's weakness, it concludes that voters will not gamble by sending someone without a record of public service to the White House.
Mr. Forbes, he said, "is an intellectual in politics. The irony is it is the left that has featured intellectuals in politics." The downside of intellectuals as candidates, he said, is that they often lack practical experience and do not have a good feel for the lives of ordinary Americans.

HEADLINE: Soothing Tone by Russian Communist at Business Forum

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Plutocrats of the world, you have nothing more to lose in Russia if a Communist is elected President than you do already under the unpredictable incumbent, Boris N. Yeltsin.
That was the message the Russian Communist Party leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, brought to business and political leaders from around the globe in this Alpine ski resort over the weekend. 
 Mr. Zyuganov's promises to safeguard private property and to continue a market economy in Russia if he is elected in June were vague, and he refused to say today whether he supported ratification of the Start II strategic arms limitation treaty with the United States.
Privatized companies, he said, could stay in private hands "if they work well and are being run properly."
"What we are going to do is create a climate of confidence," he promised, and since public opinion polls in Russia show he would get 14 percent of the vote, compared with 5 percent for Mr. Yeltsin, business leaders listened.
But some of them, at the annual privately sponsored World Economic Forum here, appeared to feel that Russia was on a slippery economic slope no matter who wins the election.
"Russia has a poor reputation," said Percy Barnevik, president and chief executive of ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., a Swedish-Swiss company that has invested $500 million there.
Grigory A. Yavlinsky, expected to be one of the leading anti-Communist candidates and also leading Mr. Yeltsin with 11 percent in the polls, was here fencing with Mr. Zyuganov. Their debates made clear that both men share the view that Mr. Yeltsin and his Government have bungled Russia's transition to a market economy and have strengthened the forces of nationalist reaction.
"In our country, it's the mafia and corrupt bureaucrats who have power," said Mr. Zyuganov, referring to the organized crime that has become endemic in Russia.
"We believe in a regulated market where every type of ownership -- state, collective, partial, private -- is allowed to have its place in the sun," he said.
Mr. Yavlinsky, who has been a leading proponent of economic change in Russia, said the Government had botched it by letting inflation run wild and then reining it in by simply not paying workers, coal miners and retirees for months at a time.
The Russian Minister of Economics, Yevgeny G. Yasin, was here reassuring potential investors that Mr. Yeltsin's recent replacement of important economic officials did not mean he was giving up on the market economy.
Mr. Yasin also pointed out that inflation had been reduced from 320 percent to 60 or 65 percent annually and was still going down.
That, Mr. Yavlinsky noted, was like saying the operation had been a success when the patient had died.
Mr. Yeltsin was not here to defend himself, but a battery of Government officials came for what has become an annual Russian invasion of Davos in answer to invitations from the conference organizers to meet with movers and shakers of the business world in informal surroundings.
Mr. Yasin had estimated the need for foreign direct investment in Russia at $12 billion to $15 billion for the next 20 years, 10 times more per year than foreign companies risked there last year.
Mr. Zyuganov interjected, "No serious investor is going to invest in a country like ours if you think that every three or four years the rules are going to change."
Mr. Yavlinsky dismissed Mr. Zyuganov as a mere figurehead controlled by a party yearning to bring back the old Soviet days of iron-fisted rule.
His audiences appreciated Mr. Zyuganov's wit but went away with little concrete indication of what policies he would pursue if he were President. In legislative elections in December, the Communists fell short of a majority but won the largest bloc of seats in the lower house of Parliament.
Some foreign investors have begun complaining that neither Mr. Yeltsin nor the staunchly independent Mayor of Moscow, Yuri M. Luzhkov, have made good on promises to treat foreign investors well.
"In the last 12 months, there is an atmosphere of real unfriendliness in Moscow," said Beat Curti, representing Sadco, a company that operates 16 Western food stories and 7 restaurants in the Russian capital.
"Tax inspectors from the city come and spend months in our offices looking over our books and then they come back and say, 'We forgot to tell you -- the liquor tax since January is double what you've been paying,' " Mr. Curti explained. He told Mr. Luzhkov, "We are considering withdrawing."
The Mayor promised to look into the matter, but Sadco's complaints are far from unique, other experts say.
With all the chaos, Mr. Zyuganov's Communists are being taken seriously. "There are many ways in which our party is different from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union," he told the business leaders. "That was not a party as such, but a power structure that ran the whole country. We recognize political pluralism, and we no longer put all our ships on atheism and all the other isms we used to subscribe to."
But Mr. Zyuganov said the possibility of NATO expansion cast a shadow of doubt over Russian ratification of the Start II treaty.
Mr. Yeltsin, under pressure from the powerful far-right nationalist bloc led by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, also opposes NATO expansion, and sent Deputy Minister of Defense Andrei Kokoshin to Munich, Germany, this weekend to tell a European security conference there that pressing ahead with it could backfire and turn Russia against the West.
Mr. Yavlinsky, asked about his attitude toward NATO expansion, replied: "Russia has no right to teach other countries what to do and what blocs they want to be in. Russia has enough problems inside."

HEADLINE: Charities Aiding Poor Fear Loss of Government Subsidies

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
While critics of Government spending on social services have been asking the nation's charities to take responsibility for the poor, sick and elderly who would be hurt by budget cutbacks, many of the cuts would force those groups to turn away people they now help.
Many large religious and other social service organizations get more than half of their budgets from Federal, state and local government support, as much as 40 percent from Washington alone. Dozens of executives of these organizations, who run everything from soup kitchens to hospitals, said in interviews that moves to cut spending in Washington and state capitals, including Albany, would endanger their programs. 
 From what is known of the latest Congressional and White House proposals for balancing the Federal budget in seven years, charity groups would lose $140 billion to $150 billion in revenues now earmarked for health, education, welfare, community development and overseas relief, according to a study by Lester M. Salamon, director of the Institute for Policy Studies at Johns Hopkins University and Alan J. Abramson of the Aspen Institute, a think tank.
The Federal ax has not fallen on most programs yet, with President Clinton and the Republicans in Congress still wrangling over a balanced-budget plan. And the full effects of many of the spending limits on the table would be put off until the end of the seven-year period, which could allow time for Washington to change its mind and for social service providers to seek other sources of money.
But the scope of the reductions being considered is immense. In New York City, they threaten to curtail programs ranging from the daily brown bag lunches for 80 homeless people at the Episcopal Church of Christ and St. Stephen's in Manhattan to the home-health-care programs for the elderly operated by the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. Nationally, they would drain billions from Medicaid and Medicare programs that keep hundreds of religious-affiliated and other nonprofit hospitals and nursing homes afloat.
Many critics of social programs say that private groups can pick up the slack. Speaker Newt Gingrich, for example, has said private orphanages could do a better job for troubled poor children than Federally financed welfare programs. And a Republican Presidential candidate, Steve Forbes, has called current programs a "monstrous system" that should be dismantled, making it "possible for private charity to become more involved."
For the most part, the mainstream religious charities, groups that provided much of the private charity in the United States, say that they have no contingency plans for maintaining their safety nets for the poor if the Government pulls back. The charities say private donations cover only a fraction of their costs and are growing slowly at a time of widespread economic uncertainty.
"Even before the welfare and other cuts go through, we are having a hard time," said Lisa Carr, a government affairs expert with Catholic Charities USA in Alexandria, Va. "More people are coming into our agencies for a meal," she said. "Some agencies have to triage."
The growth of government support for services provided by religious institutions has partly been deliberate and partly coincidental.
For certain kinds of aid -- for the homeless, mentally ill, immigrants and battered women, for example -- the Government turned to religious and other private nonprofit agencies on the theory that the services "could actually be better, more efficient and responsive, less tangled in red tape," said Martha R. Burt, a social services expert at the Urban Institute, a Washington-based research center.
But now, the rising tide of antigovernment sentiment is washing over these mainstream religious charities, whose liberal social agendas are under attack and whose political allies are in retreat. "They are being punished, in part, because of their ties to the Democratic Party," said Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard University.
By contrast, a number of conservative churches, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and many evangelical denominations, have shunned government aid, preferring to avert constitutional restrictions on the spiritual content of their social work. These churches often dispense a religious message along with food and shelter for the homeless or drug and alcohol counseling, said Paul Nelson, president of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability. The council, which includes 815 churches and television ministries, like Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network, raised $4.4 billion in public appeals last year.
In large measure, the growing reliance by church groups on government money simply reflects the runaway growth of spending on health care, a sector in which Jewish and Christian charities long have played a big role.
Nonprofit hospitals typically depend on government for 48 percent of their revenue from patient care, according to the American Hospital Association. Nonprofit hospitals and nursing homes were projected to get more than $130 billion in Government money last year, largely through Medicaid and Medicare, up from $60 billion in the late 1970's.
So the blow would be sharp if those programs were curtailed. On the seven-year road to a balanced budget, the nation's Catholic hospitals alone say they would lose $17 billion in reduced Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
The proposed Federal and state cutbacks would take an enormous bite from the budgets of big New York hospitals, for example: $2.5 billion over the seven years from seven Jewish-affiliated hospitals, $1 billion from the 15 Catholic hospitals and 9 nursing homes in the New York Archdiocese, and $200 million from the 4 hospitals and 3 nursing homes of the Brooklyn and Queens diocese.
For social services -- like soup kitchens, foster children's care, temporary shelters for the homeless, refugee resettlement, and training programs for unemployed youths -- the nation's charities will spend about $87 billion in 1996, almost half of it from Federal money, according to the Independent Sector, a nonprofit research group. And Congress is calling for 20 to 30 percent reductions in many of these programs.
Based on projections by Mr. Salamon and Mr. Abramson, Catholic charities across the country would receive about $200 million less from Washington, measured in 1994 dollars, for social service programs when the full effects of budget balancing would be felt in 2002, compared with what they would get under current law. Lutheran Social Services would be set back at least $200 million in 2002, and the Salvation Army would get about $50 million less in Federal money.
The religious-based charities insist that their services to the poor and elderly cannot help but be crippled amid a Government retreat. "We need partnerships between the Government and labor and business and the nonprofit and charitable organizations, so that our society as a whole embraces a sense of compassion and shares responsibility," said Major Paul Bollwahn, a national spokesman for the Salvation Army.
Mr. Abramson and Mr. Salamon estimate that to make up for lost Federal money, private giving would have to increase 50 percent by the year 2002.
"The Pollyanna-ish notion that churches will make up the difference is not serious," said Megan McLaughlin, executive director of the New York Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. "All the foundation grants across the nation could not fill the gap created in one of our big programs in the city."
The Federal cutbacks would be compounded in New York -- which, like other big cities, has a dense web of religious-based social service groups -- by reductions planned or already implemented by state and local governments.
In the budget he announced last December, Gov. George E. Pataki called for 26 percent cuts in welfare payments and other benefit reductions that the social-service agencies fear will increase the demands on their already overtaxed food and housing assistance programs. Mr. Pataki said on Tuesday that his overall budget plans could be devastated if Washington does not give the states the flexibility they anticipate in welfare and Medicaid spending.
In New York City, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has already cut many contracts with child welfare agencies in the current fiscal year -- reductions that have translated directly into job losses and diluted services. For example, 20 jobs were cut and the remaining caseworkers' loads increased in the Bedford-Stuyvesant programs operated by Miracle Makers Family and Children's Services, an offshoot of the Free Will Church of God and Christ.
In New York, the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies said that Federal, state and local spending cuts being considered would take $14 million from its child welfare services this year, along with $12.5 million from nursing homes, $6 million from home care for the elderly, and $5 million from mental health centers, said Stephen D. Solender, executive vice president.
Most other states already are strapped for cash, as well -- and are passing the squeeze on to the nonprofit agencies.
For example, the Lutherans, who operate one-third of the nation's nonprofit nursing homes, are losing an average of $15 a day on every Michigan nursing home occupant on Medicaid, said Kay Bengston, a spokeswoman in Washington for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

HEADLINE: Chinese Tiptoe Into Internet, Wary of Watchdogs

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Inside a gray six-story office building, a dozen young men gathered around a conference room table on Saturday evening to discuss the Internet. Only one was over 30, and all looked like computer nerds, the kind of people who prefer to spend a Saturday night talking about their favorite software, rather than venturing into one of the lively cafes on the street below.
Yet with the Chinese authorities tightening control over information networks, even something as innocuous as an Internet club is now suspect. So the participants met with an air of secrecy, engaged in a lengthy debate over lukewarm cups of tea on how to avoid Government interference, and wondered about the true identity of five latecomers who sat to one side of the room and said little. 
 "The Internet is still very sensitive in China," said a 24-year-old computer technician, who like the other participants asked not to be identified. "We're not trying to do anything illegal, but if the Government finds out about us, we're finished."
The Internet is just starting to grow in China, and the authorities are trying to keep it firmly within their grasp. Today, China issued a new set of rules to regulate Internet use, the latest in a recent series of moves to assert control over the flow of information here.
Rather than try to choke off Internet access, as some of the young men gathered around the table had feared, the regulations instead appear to be steering the flow of electronic information through officially controlled ports so that it can be better monitored.
The new regulations require that any network offering Internet service be subject to close supervision by the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications or one of three other designated Government agencies, the New China News Agency announced.
The new regulations are intended to insure "healthier development of the exchange of international computer information," the news agency said. But the rules were clearly also concerned with information the Government deems threatening.
"Neither organizations nor individuals are allowed to engage in activities at the expense of state security and secrets," the agency said. "They are also forbidden to produce, retrieve, duplicate or spread information that may hinder public order."
The transmission of pornographic or obscene material was also expressly banned.
The rules come at a time when Internet users in China have gained easy access to a wide range of politically sensitive material posted by dissident groups based outside of China.
Reports that were accessible within China via the Internet today were offered by Human Rights in China, a New York-based group; the Center for Modern China, run by the dissident writer Liu Binyan and based in Princeton, N.J., and China Spring, another New York-based dissident group.
China's security apparatus is widely believed to monitor an enormous volume of telephone and fax connections, and it is expected to do the same with Internet messages. It is an open question whether the authorities will try to block access to information they do not like, and whether they would succeed if they tried.
Access to the Internet, however, is still a privilege for relatively few in a country where few homes have a private telephone let alone a computer. Most who have access to a computer do so through their workplace.
About 4,000 people have registered for Internet accounts with the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications in Beijing and Shanghai since it began offering China's main commercial Internet service in mid-1995.
Zhang Shiyong, a computer science professor at Fudan University in Shanghai who directs the university's Internet operations and advises Shanghai's Post and Telecommunications on computer networks, estimates that fewer than 30,000 Internet users in China have an e-mail address, mostly university professors and students, and scientific researchers.
Others familiar with the Internet assert that 50,000 to 100,000 in China may be using it, many of them university students with irregular access because of limited computer time, and others who privately pay a registered user to share an e-mail address.
A main impediment to Internet growth is the high cost. While university professors and students get e-mail free, Shanghai's Post and Telecommunications office charges $75 a month for 40 hours of use, a sizable fee in a city where a typical office worker makes $250 a month.
For all the free speech potential that the Internet portends, Robin Munro, Hong Kong director of Human Rights Watch/Asia, said few if any dissidents within China had access to it, because of limited access to computers. He suggested that, with official monitoring, the Internet would not be an ideal route for transmitting politically sensitive information anyway.
Most professors who use the Internet focus on research, Professor Zhang said, while most graduate students he knows use it to get information on how to study overseas.
"We're not happy about that, of course, but we don't stop it," he said. "We want to encourage them to use the Internet as much as possible."
Proponents of the Internet hope that Chinese users will eventually send 70 percent of their electronic transmissions to other domestic users, Professor Zhang added. He estimates that only about 10 percent are domestic now, with an overwhelming majority of e-mail directed overseas.
Today's regulations were not the only recent effort to control information services in China. Last month, the Government announced that foreign news organizations selling economic information would now be supervised by the New China News Agency, which will have the final say over who can have access to the service and how much they pay.
President Jiang Zemin, in one of several efforts to assert wider political authority, recently called on the nation's news media to "pay special attention to politics." In less formal wording: obey orders.
In early January, the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications suspended all new subscriptions to the Internet indefinitely. The official reason was that this was necessary while the network's technical capacity was expanded, but officials of the Shanghai Post and Telecommunications said that authorities in Beijing suspended the system's growth while they formulated the new regulations.
Now that the regulations are out, new subscriptions will presumably resume soon.
As concerned as they are about the Internet's ability to spread undesirable information efficiently, China's leaders also recognize its benefits.
Shanghai's municipal government recently announced plans to link its tax offices and social security services via a local Internet connection, as well as to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in telecommunications infrastructure.
"Over the past few years, with the growth of a market economy and progress in spreading information, computer information networks have been playing an active role in accelerating China's economic, scientific, technological and educational development," the New China News Agency reported in January.
At the gathering on Saturday evening, nearly all of the participants voiced optimism that the expansion of Internet China would help businesses, in particular, because of the way it would expand their access to information.
All, that is, but the four conservatively dressed men and one woman who came late and sat in a clump to one side. None offered a name card when all others attending passed out their own, and none signed the e-mail address list.
They watched, they listened, they said little. One took notes. And everyone else was reminded that, Internet or not, best watch what one says.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Washington Confronts China

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Washington has chosen the issue on which it will at last acknowledge and confront Chinese Communist action detrimental to the United States.
There was a considerable list to choose from. China threatens daily missile attacks against Taiwan. Beijing sells missiles to Iran and other Mideast dictatorships. At home it increases arrests and jail sentences for dissidents. It allows Internet use to only a relative handful, and from now on only through government-controlled ports. 
 Each act involves the U.S. An attack on Taiwan would force U.S. involvement. Sales of missiles endanger Mideast peace and defy U.S. policy against proliferation of high-tech weapons.
Increasing repression and closing access to international information is a slap at the U.S. Washington had assured the world of the opposite -- that freedoms would increase in China after the 1994 Clinton Administration decision not to use economic pressure to ease oppression.
Well, enough is enough. Washington now says it will show its staunch determination to resist Chinese provocation -- about compact disks. If China does not stop counterfeiting these disks, the Administration will increase tariffs on Chinese goods by as much as $1 billion.
Any commercial piracy costs manufacturers and artists money and should be opposed. But to appreciate the CD episode fully it helps to have a taste for bitter comedy.
1. The Communists will not keep any new promise better than they keep existing ones -- or others, like ending slave-labor exports to the U.S.
2. If they do camouflage piracy better, they will demand concessions -- like even tighter zipping of the U.S. mouth on human rights.
3. The U.S. announcement accentuates the moral disaster of Clintonian policy on China. CD's yes, people no. Mr. Clinton broke his promise to use tariff pressure to persuade Beijing to treat its Chinese and Tibetan political victims less viciously -- maybe a mite less torture. Beijing answers by increasing, not decreasing, political oppression. He acts surprised.
Democrats and Republican politicians talk about the danger of cynicism. But they expect Americans not to see the cynicism of putting CD's above the blood of dissidents in China's gulags.
Worse, they may be right. I do not hear American university students or professors mobilizing against Chinese Communist cruelties, or consumers organizing a boycott like the one that helped kill South African apartheid.
If war comes to Taiwan, it will not be because Beijing believes its lie that Taiwan is preparing to declare its deserved independence. It will be because 100 miles off China's shore, Chinese people have created a society that is both prosperous and democratic. That so terrifies the perpetually insecure Politburo that it risks war -- not only against Taiwanese independence of government but Taiwanese independence of mind.
Beijing uses missile threats to intimidate Taiwanese into voting for a party that is running on a pro-China platform and against independent-minded opponents.
The Taiwan Relations Act, passed by Congress in 1979, says that U.S. recognition of Communist China rests on the expectation that Taiwan's future will be determined by peaceful means.
The law states that any effort to determine Taiwan's future by other than peaceful means -- which includes threats of daily missile attacks -- are of grave concern to the U.S. and should be "promptly" reported by the President to Congress.
The President has not done that, promptly or at all. Nor has Congress demanded it, despite some members' attempts. Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Dole, the agenda-setters, become accomplices in the President's decision to ignore U.S. law.
Restraint is needed, we are told by U.S. officials and some journalists -- we do not want a war over Taiwan, do we? Of course not. That is what facing the possibility is all about.
As long as Congress and President ignore their legal obligation to deal with China's threat to Taiwan, decide what steps to take and let China know, Beijing will believe it can attack Taiwan or keep terrorizing it, with no risk.
That is not restraint of confrontation that could lead to war. It is the blundering encouragement of both. How terribly many times must we learn?

HEADLINE: Space Probe Is Set to Visit Eros, An Earth-Grazing Asteroid

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
SPEEDING through the wastelands of space is a riot of rubble left over from the creation of the solar system, including lumps of rock up to hundreds of miles wide that orbit the Sun, mainly in a belt between Mars and Jupiter. These bodies, known as asteroids, are studied for clues to how the solar system formed more than four billion years ago.
Recently they have also been recognized as doomsday rocks that can stray away from their usual paths to mutilate planets, as suggested by craters on the Moon, Mars and Earth, and perhaps by the demise of dinosaurs and many other creatures 65 million years ago. Today some asteroids pass quite close by Earth and others cross its path. In the future, they might pose a threat to terrestrial life by smashing into the planet and kicking up enough dust to temporarily blot out the Sun and alter the climate, though scientists know of no killer rocks headed in this direction. 
 Later this month, an assault on the riddles of the asteroids is scheduled to begin as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration launches the world's first spacecraft meant to orbit one of these rocky interlopers. A three-year, 1.3-billion mile journey through space is to culminate with nearly a year of asteroid study. The car-size probe carries seven instruments and is to orbit within 20 or so miles of the rocky surface, and perhaps much closer during the mission's final days.
The target is an asteroid named Eros after the Greek god of love. Twice the size of Manhattan, the elongated rock passes relatively close to Earth on its chaotic sweep through the solar system and in the future may start crossing the planet's path, raising the possibility of a collision. Eros is representative of the dominant class of asteroids that roam near Earth, so its investigation is expected to answer a swarm of questions about the nature and hazards of asteroids as well as the origins and composition of the solar system.
"We've flown past asteroids but it was like taking snapshots of the Grand Canyon out the window of a car," Dr. Richard P. Binzel, a planetary scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an interview. "Now we're going to stop and look and study one in detail. I think the mission will challenge our understanding of small bodies and force us to relearn fundamental things once we're confronted with the detailed data."
In an important milestone for space science, given the shrinking Federal purse, the mission is the first of a new class of low-budget explorations that are seen as the wave of the future. The current Galileo mission to Jupiter, launched six years ago, cost $1.6 billion. But the bill for the asteroid rendezvous is less than $170 million, including its launching by a Delta rocket -- a pittance by traditional standards.
"This is a revolution," Dr. Wesley T. Huntress Jr., NASA's associate administrator for space science, said in an interview. "It's a whole new way of doing business."
So great is the change that the builder and operator of the spacecraft is not NASA. Instead, in a bid for thrift, the work was done by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., marking the first time an outside organization has run one of the agency's deep-space explorations.
"We took a planetary mission and did it better, faster and cheaper," said Dr. Stamatios M. Krimigis, head of the space department at the Applied Physics Laboratory, adding that the probe's design and building took a little more than two years, an unusually speedy pace.
Spacecraft have occasionally drawn close to some of the leftovers of creation, but none have orbited them for close scrutiny. A decade ago, an international fleet of probes flew past Halley's Comet, one within about 300 miles of the icy body. And the Galileo probe on its way to Jupiter photographed two asteroids a thousand or so miles distant, 12-mile-long Gaspra in 1991, and 34-mile-long Ida in 1993, the latter body turning out to have a small satellite, which was given the name Dactyl.
Eros was first seen by telescopes in Germany and France in 1898 and soon afterward was recognized as the first asteroid that could speed close to Earth. Today, after decades of surveillance with Earth-based telescopes and radars, the rocky body is thought to be about 25 miles long. And it is the second largest of the hundreds of known asteroids that approach Earth, many of whose orbits cross the planet's path.
The composition of Eros is an enigma that mirrors the general confusion about the nature and origin of the asteroids.
Many of the rocky bodies are apparently made of crude material that is thought to be the same primitive stuff that occasionally falls to Earth in the form of the stony meteorites known as chondrites, which contain lots of primitive silicate rock, as is found widely on Earth. Others were apparently once heated and transformed early in the solar system's history, separating into rock and metals, not unlike iron-rich meteorites that sometimes fall to Earth.
The former type of asteroid suggests primordial matter that never jelled into a planet. The latter implies debris from small planets or planetoids that formed and became geologically active, perhaps with volcanoes and hot cores, before they broke up in catastrophic collisions.
Eros is a kind of asteroid, known as an S type, meaning silicate bearing, that dominates the population of the inner asteroid belt. Yet scientists cannot agree on whether all S-type asteroids are made of primitive or melted material.
"Three decades of increasingly detailed telescope observation have not resolved the dilemma," Dr. Robert Farquhar and Dr. Joseph Veverka, project team members, recently wrote in The Planetary Report, a publication of the Pasadena-based Planetary Society.
The plan for an orbital mission to Eros has been aggressively promoted by Daniel S. Goldin, NASA's Administrator for nearly four years and a champion of doing things smaller, cheaper, better, faster, as he puts it. The flight is the inaugural mission of the Discovery Program, a NASA initiative for small planetary missions with a maximum three-year development time and a maximum cost of $150 million.
The Eros probe is known officially as NEAR, for Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous. It is scheduled to lift off on Feb. 16 from Cape Canaveral, Fla. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., is to navigate the craft on its journey of more than a billion miles through space, as the laboratory has done for all of NASA's deep-space missions.
The voyage to Eros is complex because the asteroid orbits the Sun at an angle 10.8 degrees off that of the disklike plane that the planets whirl through, loping down many millions of miles below that horizontal layer in its rush through the solar system. The probe, to achieve the rendezvous, must match this unconventional orbit.
After its launching, the spacecraft is to swing out far past the orbit of Mars, passing by the large asteroid Mathilde on this leg of the journey and possibly photographing it, and then come barreling back toward Earth for a close flyby in January 1998. At this point flight controllers will use the planet's gravity to increase the probe's speed and change its orbital plane to match that of the prime target.
Final maneuvers are to begin in January 1999. As the spacecraft approaches Eros, it will begin firing a large rocket engine to slow itself and match the asteroid's speed, making its first close encounter in February 1999 at a distance of about 300 miles.
If no dangerous satellites are discovered that would hamper a closer approach, the probe will slowly be maneuvered toward the asteroid until in March 1999 it reaches its optimal orbit for scientific study of 20 to 30 miles high. The detailed observations are to last until the end of the millennium.
The main scientific aims of the mission are to measure the asteroid's size, shape, volume, mass, gravity field, spin state, surface composition, geology, morphology, texture, mass distribution and magnetic field. To do so, the probe carries a camera, a gamma-ray spectrometer, a near-infrared spectrograph, a magnetometer and a laser range finder, among other instruments.
Scientists believe that clues to the nature of the early solar system are preserved on small bodies like asteroids. In contrast, the cosmic records of large, planetary bodies have been altered or destroyed over the ages by the traumas of planetary evolution. In particular, near-Earth asteroids are thought to hold clues to the nature of the building blocks of the inner planets, including Earth.
In addition to raw scientific insights, the mission to Eros is seen as possibly yielding findings that may help humankind wrestle with the possibility of killer rocks descending on the planet from space. First, a better understanding of asteroids would aid predictions of how the rocky bodies would interact with the atmosphere and Earth upon fiery impact. Second, it would aid in developing possible safeguards.
"The more knowledgeable one is about these objects," said Dr. Clark R. Chapman, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute, based in Tucson, and a member of the mission team, "the more we can figure what we'd have to do to move them or otherwise get out of harm's way."
In recent years, scientists have speculated about using bombs or rocket engines to nudge threatening asteroids out of Earth's path or to destroy them.
Scientists are closely watching the Eros mission not only for its insights but as a critical test of the space agency's new small-is-beautiful philosophy, which is sometimes viewed skeptically by a generation of experts that relied on large budgets to push the glory days of planetary exploration to the dim edges of the solar system and beyond.
"These things are being touted as a whole new way of producing science cheaply," said Dr. Joseph A. Burns, an astronomer at Cornell University who is a past chairman of the Committee on Planetary and Lunar Exploration at the National Academy of Sciences, a private group that advises the Government. "But it's not clear that the science return per dollar is going to be there. It's an experiment."
But the chief scientist of the rendezvous mission, Dr. Andrew F. Cheng, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, said no corners had been cut to develop the spacecraft, which relies on many more miniaturized components and innovative materials than did past probes.
"It's a full-science mission in the grand old tradition," Dr. Cheng said. "But it doesn't bust the budget."

HEADLINE: Helium Won't Fill Future Demands, Physicists Warn

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE 

 BODY:
IN the century since it was discovered as a trace ingredient of the uranium mineral clevite, helium, the second lightest of all elements, has become indispensable to science and technology. Scientists believe it could play a vital role in helping the world through future energy shortages.
But as Congress and the White House move to end Government participation in helium conservation, the American Physical Society, a professional society of physicists, warns that the most economically exploited source of this nonrenewable substance will be depleted in 21 years unless steps are taken to halt a growing helium hemorrhage. 
 The society calculates that although American producers recover about 3.3 billion cubic feet of helium from natural gas each year, another 3.2 billion cubic feet are thrown away because gas companies lack financial incentives to separate, refine and store it. The Federal Government operates a combined stockpile and buffer stock, into which commercial producers deposit helium when demand is low, for later withdrawal if necessary. Critics contend that Government involvement is unnecessary and interferes with the market's ability to match supply with demand.
A world shortage of helium a generation from now could obstruct the development of superconducting power lines, motors, generators, electricity storage systems, magnetically levitated trains and many applications not yet even imagined, the American Physical Society says. Helium is not only irreplaceable; it can also do things that no other substance can even approximate.
Helium is commercially recovered from certain natural gas reservoirs, mainly in the United States. Because it is a noninflammable gas with nearly as much lifting power as inflammable hydrogen, it was prized by airship builders and users following World War I, a conflict in which hydrogen-filled Zeppelin bombers had proved to be deathtraps. After the war, the United States banned the export of helium to deprive potential enemies of fire-resistant airships, and later created a strategic helium stockpile, a reserve that now contains 32 billion cubic feet.
But dirigible airships are no longer regarded as strategically important weapons and, in any case, many lawmakers opposes the continued maintenance of any Federal stockpiles. One of the present targets of Congress is the national helium stockpile, as well as Federal participation in the extraction of the gas.
In December, the American Physical Society deplored the projected liquidation of Government helium reserves and reported that 3.2 billion cubic feet of helium are being dumped into the atmosphere each year and are forever lost. Unless the Government creates economic incentives to private industry for extracting and storing the otherwise wasted helium, one of the world's most valuable resources will be squandered at incalculable cost to future generations, the group said.
"The present world growth rate in demand for helium is about 10 percent per year," the society's report said. "A simple calculation shows that if that rate were to continue, and if helium production could keep up with the demand, United States helium-rich reserves would be exhausted in only 21 years."
The United States has large reserves of helium mixed with natural methane in the gas fields of Texas, Wyoming and a few other states. America is virtually the world's only source of natural gas containing 0.3 percent or more of helium. In Russia and Poland, two of the other main sources of helium, natural gas generally contains 0.1 percent or less of helium, and such a lean mixture is much more expensive to separate, said Dr. Robert L. Park of the University of Maryland, spokesman for the physicists' society.
Helium is separated from the natural gas with which it is mixed either by adsorbing the natural gas in charcoal or other materials, or by compressing and cooling the methane and other gases until all but the helium are liquefied. Helium, which remains a gas unless it is chilled to minus 452 degrees Fahrenheit, is then pumped off.
The main obstacle to extracting and storing helium, experts agree, is the mismatch in market demands for natural fuel gas and helium. When demand for natural gas is heavy, as is normally the case in winter, large amounts of helium are withdrawn from gas wells along with the natural gas, but if there is little commercial demand for helium at that point, there is no economic incentive to extract and save it, said Dr. Park. Gas companies then generally avoid the expense of separating the helium, which consequently remains mixed with the natural gas and is lost when the gas is burned.
Congress has decreed the demise of the Bureau of Mines, and has ordered the shutdown of the bureau's helium separation plant near Amarillo, Tex., which produces about 10 percent of the nation's helium. (The rest is produced by commercial gas companies: Praxair Inc. of Danbury, Conn.; the BOC Group, a British company with American headquarters in Murray Hill, N.J.; Air Products and Chemicals Inc. of Allentown, Pa., and the Exxon Corporation are among the main producers.) In his State of the Union address last year, President Clinton also proposed closing down the Government's helium reserve program, including the closing of the Cliffside Dome storage well -- a depleted natural gas cavern near Amarillo -- which contains the national helium stockpile.
The Cliffside Dome, which is about one-third full, is connected by pipelines to other helium-rich gas fields, and when supplies of the extracted gas exceed demand, Cliffside serves as an overrun storage site, from which helium can be later drawn.
Even defenders of the maintenance of a helium stockpile acknowledge that the Bureau of Mines's Exell helium refining plant near the Cliffside Dome is outdated, inefficient and expensive, and they say it holds an unfair financial advantage over private competitors. All Government agencies that buy helium must by law purchase it from the Bureau of Mines, which sells the gas at $55 per thousand cubic feet, nearly 10 percent more than the price offered by commercial suppliers.
The bureau's helium operation, moreover, is heavily in debt. But the debt of $1.4 billion is misleading, said Dr. Philip C. Tully, a helium expert at the Bureau of Mines.
"Most of that money consists of interest we supposedly owe the Treasury Department for the $252 million they advanced to us to create the strategic helium reserve," Dr. Tully said in an interview. "It's just one Government agency in debt to another Government agency -- a paper debt -- and Congress could wipe it out with the stroke of a pen, at no cost to taxpayers."
But neither the Bureau of Mines nor helium conservation has many friends in Congress.
A key sponsor of legislation to end all Federal helium programs is Representative Christopher Cox, a California Republican, who believes the fears expressed by the American Physical Society are groundless.
"No matter who gains title to the helium in the Federal stockpile, the helium will still exist," Mr. Cox said in an interview. "It won't be wasted. The only real risk is that the Government might sell it off quickly to get cash to reduce the deficit. That's misleading accounting practice. But we are contemplating a gradual transfer of ownership, taking half a lifetime."
Market demand will determine how much helium commercial producers extract from the natural gas they sell, and as supplies of helium decrease, Mr. Cox believes, higher prices will create incentives to extract more helium. "The gas companies are already extracting 90 percent of the helium produced in this country, and they will certainly continue," Mr. Cox said.
Dr. Park says the American Physical Society takes no position as to whether helium conservation should be the responsibility of Government or of private companies. "Our grandchildren aren't going to give a damn who saves the world's richest supply of helium, as long as someone does it, and does it before supplies run out," he said. "Surely, our politicians should be able to devise some incentive system to encourage private industry to save the helium. Congress has created lots of incentives for other purposes."
But Mr. Cox rejects this approach, saying that "Government tinkering with future price structures would be very dangerous."
Helium was first discovered in the sun, not on earth. In 1868 while observing a solar eclipse, a French astronomer, Pierre Janssen, detected lines in the sun's light spectrum that did not match those of any known element. The presumed new element was dubbed helium after the Greek word for sun: helios. In 1885, helium was discovered to exist on earth as well. Helium is now known to be the second most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen. But when it escapes from underground caverns where it has collected over the eons chiefly as a decay product of radioactive minerals, it mixes with air, rises into the atmosphere and is lost.
Although American airships and balloons -- both the full-size versions and small weather balloons -- are still inflated with helium, that use of the gas accounts for only about 10 percent of its consumption. (The toy balloons popular at parties and political rallies consume such trivial amounts of helium that conservation advocates say they represent no significant drain.) Major American uses of helium are for purging and pressurizing the fuel tanks of NASA and Defense Department spacecraft, for high-temperature welding and in cryogenic applications like the magnetic resonance imaging machines used by hospitals.
About one-third of America's annual helium production is exported to foreign users, and foreign demand is increasing steadily.
Helium has special importance to scientists because its physical properties are unique among all the other 100-odd elements. It is the only element that remains liquid at even a tiny fraction of a degree above absolute zero, which is equivalent to minus 459.67 Fahrenheit. Liquid helium cannot freeze solid, no matter how close to the absolute zero it is chilled.
Because it remains liquid at ultralow temperatures, liquid helium is vital as a medium for chilling mercury, arsenic, niobium and other elements to temperatures at which they lose all resistance to electricity, becoming superconductors.
Although various compounds based on copper oxide become superconductors at much higher temperatures, warmer than that of liquid nitrogen (minus 320.4 degrees Fahrenheit), these compounds are difficult to incorporate into useful implements, and so far, their use has been limited.
Among the major users of liquid helium for chilling superconductors are the huge accelerator laboratories studying nature's fundamental particles. The Fermilab Tevatron accelerator at Batavia, Ill., is a four-mile ring of superconducting magnets, all of them continuously cooled by liquid helium. Fermilab operates the world's largest liquid-helium refrigeration plant, but it will soon take second place to a project under construction near Geneva.
On a smaller scale, astronomers are heavily dependent on liquid helium for cooling infrared and microwave sensors in their telescopes. Such sensors must be chilled to eliminate the heat "noise" that otherwise masks the faint heat signals from distant celestial objects.
"Sooner or later we're going to have to start husbanding our helium," Dr. Park said. "If we do it now, we can save the helium-rich supply before it goes up the chimney. If we wait, we'll still need helium, but it will be vastly more expensive to separate from helium-poor gas supplies. Have we the right to mortgage our future?"

Dollar Drops Against the Mark On Doubts of Further Rate Cuts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar weakened yesterday as expectations faded that Germany would soon push interest rates lower.
Germany yesterday reported a stronger-than-expected industrial output figure, showing a slightly stronger economy. In addition, Hans Tietmeyer, the president of the Bundesbank, the German central bank, reiterated remarks that the German economy was likely to improve this year. 
 The news dampened expectations that Germany would lower key interest rates, which typically hurt the mark's value.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar was trading at 1.4665 German marks, compared with 1.4823 on Friday. It finished at 105.10 Japanese yen, compared with 106.55 the previous session. The British pound rose to $1.5401 from $1.5235.
The dollar, drawing support from recent interest rate cuts in Germany, has been rising since late last year against the mark and yen.
But given that the dollar still has not recovered fully from post-World War II lows hit last spring, "the dollar's long-term trend is still down," said Dan Ascani, editor and publisher of Global Market Strategist, an advisory firm in Gainesville, Ga.
The dollar fell against the yen yesterday as an opportunity evaporated to borrow at low Japanese rates and buy United States Treasury bonds at higher yields. The dollar's recent strength made the tactic too risky, analysts said.
Traders had been borrowing yen at half of 1 percent and 1 percent, the prevailing Japanese interest rates, then converting the yen into dollars and buying American bonds for a higher return. That worked when the dollar was worth 100 yen to 101 yen.
But now, said John Ryding, senior economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, with the dollar hitting 107 yen last week, that equation was no longer worth the risk.
With the dollar down to 105 yen, that wipes out about 2 percent of the return.
So yesterday, some traders were "just cashing in some chips" and taking profits, Mr. Ascani of Global Market Strategist said.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday, were: 1.1960 Swiss francs, down from 1.2139; 5.0370 French francs, down from 5.0915, and 1,569 Italian lire, down from 1,574.

HEADLINE: The Arts Are Again Invited to the Budget Dance

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
The arts may be an economic engine driving New York City, as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has often said, but once again City Hall is threatening to cut back the fuel supply.
This time, in the face of an estimated $2.75 billion city budget gap over the next year and a half, the Mayor has proposed a reduction of nearly 17 percent from last year in the amount spent to maintain New York's major cultural institutions and to subsidize hundreds of local arts groups. The preliminary budget announced by the Mayor last week sought about $65 million for the major groups and $7 million for the smaller ones for those purposes in the fiscal year 1997, which begins July 1, compared with $84 million in the current budget. Other cultural appropriations bring the total to $98.1 million. 
 People in the arts say they know that when budget cuts are reaching the Police Department, the pain has to be spread around. "There's no question this is a bad year and the Mayor has to confront some hard questions," said Janet Schneider, executive director of the Cultural Institutions Group, which represents 32 museums and other organizations on city-owned land. But she said, "We stand to supply revenue to the city."
Thus the news that they were expected to take a harder-than-average hit alarmed them, coming as it did from a Mayor who has so frequently spoken out for the arts. ("Culture is to New York what steel was to Pittsburgh 30 years ago," he declared last April as he sliced the birthday cake at the 125th-anniversary celebration of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.) Many officials of cultural organizations appealed for help to Schuyler G. Chapin, Commissioner of Cultural Affairs, and to the City Council, which in the past six years has added about $45 million to the allocations proposed by the Mayor.
"We're tired of moaning and groaning," said Rochelle Slovin, director of the American Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens. "We've got to go forward and do our political best."
The truth is, moaning and groaning and doing one's political best is the way the budget game is played. Those with long memories know that the Mayor's preliminary budget is the first step in a ritual involving trial balloons, hand-wringing, staring matches and more often than not, compromises that ease the pain.
If past years are a guide, a good part of the money is likely to be restored by the time the budget works its way to final approval by the City Council, usually in June. "The Mayor looks to slash and the City Council looks to restore," said a former city official well acquainted with the process. "Right now they're all shooting across the bow, and nobody has the faintest idea what's happening."
Mr. Giuliani's preliminary budget, the rough outline of what the Mayor intends to present as his executive budget in April, calls for a 10 percent cut in spending for utilities and personnel for the Cultural Institutions Group, which includes many of the more prominent organizations, like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Carnegie Hall and the New York and Bronx zoos. It proposed cutting 42 percent from program grants to more than 400 arts groups large and small, including the Alvin Ailey Dance Company and the New York Philharmonic, the Bronx Arts Ensemble, the Thalia Spanish Theater in Queens and the Billie Holiday Theater in Brooklyn.
Because the Cultural Institution Group receives the bulk of the money, its 10 percent cut would equal about $7.2 million while the 42 percent cut for the arts groups would mean a loss of about $5 million of their current $12 million.
But at this stage of the budget process last year things looked worse than that, with program grants to be cut 80 percent. In the end the program groups received nearly as much money as they had the year before, and the major institutions lost only 5 percent.
Last year, $10 million (half of it from the state) of the city's cultural budget was distributed as matching funds, available only to recipients that privately raised $1 for each $1 of government money. This fiscal year, the city has allocated $4.5 million (with no state component) at a rate of $1 for each $1.50 raised on the outside. The program is renewed in the Mayor's preliminary budget for the coming year.
Over the last few days, representatives of arts groups have said they are looking to Mr. Chapin, the Cultural Affairs Commissioner, as their champion, although it may be putting him in a delicate position with the Mayor, who has not encouraged outspokenness by his commissioners. "If he tries to kick him in the butt or do an end run, he's out of a job," Harvey Lichtenstein, president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, said of Mr. Chapin.
Mr. Chapin, a former manager of the Metropolitan Opera and former dean of Columbia University's School of the Arts, does not deny some awkwardness. "The Mayor is facing a huge budget deficit and everyone is going to have to take his knocks," he said. But he added that "this is the first go," and "the budget business is never over until the final budget is put together."
Mr. Chapin also did not deny that he has had differences with John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, who oversees the Cultural Affairs Department. Even before the Giuliani administration took office in 1994, Mr. Dyson drew fire for suggesting that city money should be funneled to the large museums and performing arts companies that draw tourists and that subsidies to the smaller community based groups could be withdrawn.
"John and I have different interpretations of the purpose of cultural affairs," Mr. Chapin said. Such differences have led some arts representatives to conclude that Mr. Chapin's influence at City Hall is negligible. When representatives of the Cultural Institutions Group wanted to voice their concerns to the administration last year, they essentially bypassed Mr. Chapin and set up a meeting directly with the Mayor and Mr. Dyson. In what a participant described as an awkward gathering, Mr. Chapin essentially audited the session.
Calls to Mr. Dyson and a deputy mayoral press secretary, Deirdra L. Picou, were not returned.
While waiting for the Mayor to present a firm budget proposal in April, many people at arts organizations are taking a temperate view. Some express confidence that the Mayor expects the City Council to increase allocations in categories including the cultural affairs budget, and that the expectation of such increases is even part of the Mayor's calculations.
"The proposed cuts are not enough money to solve the budget problem and would have an extraordinarily bad impact on the arts communities and the economy as a whole," said Norma P. Munn, chairwoman of the New York City Arts Coalition, representing more than 200 smaller arts groups.
Still, this year could be different. The budget gap may be even worse than it already seems. Already the Mayor is talking about a new round of proposed cuts. The budget director could look at the Cultural Institutions Group and ask why the city is cutting the school budget while paying millions of dollars in electrical bills and maintenance services for large museums with multimillion dollar endowments. The legal answer is that it has to, up to a point: the city has a contractual relationship with museums and other cultural institutions on city land.
In any event, some arts representatives warn against demonizing an administration that has long been solicitous. "The Mayor and Deputy Mayor thoroughly understand what culture means to New York," said Ms. Slovin of the Museum of the Moving Image. "It may well be that the Mayor wants to see if we're out there." she said. "Well, we are awake."

HEADLINE: Job Trainees Support Whitman on Welfare

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: PENNSAUKEN, N.J., Jan. 31

 BODY:
Kathy Scott is a single mother of three who has been getting by on public assistance for more than a decade. Under Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's proposal to overhaul New Jersey's welfare system, Ms. Scott risks losing the only source of income she has known since the bridal shop where she worked shut down.
Yet Ms. Scott, 35, and several other aid recipients interviewed at a job training center here say they think Mrs. Whitman has the right idea. 
 "I think five years is enough to get your act together," Ms. Scott said. "I don't think I would have been on it as long as I was. It makes you dependent on a system that is not really working for you."
A five-year limit on benefits was just one of several proposals to revamp welfare that Mrs. Whitman presented to the Legislature, a package intended to enourage more welfare recipients to get jobs. Her first step to build support was to tour three job training sites, where she heard encouragement from beneficiaries, including Ms. Scott.
Of course, Ms. Scott has concerns. She lives in Camden, where the unemployment rate is 16 percent. More than two-thirds of the city's 87,400 residents depend on welfare as their main source of income.
She has heard that the state's economy is worsening and that Governor Whitman plans to eliminate 1,200 state jobs.
But Ms. Scott said she was hopeful that she would find a job, since she has completed eight months of training in medical billing at Future Works, a new program near her home that offers courses based on the local job market's needs. Ms. Scott has been making cold calls to prospective employers for a month and has some promising leads. "It can get a little discouraging," she said. "But I know I'm going to make it."
Mrs. Whitman proposed shifting the emphasis from education and job training that would permanently raise recipients' income levels to moving people quickly into entry-level jobs. Benefits would be limited to five years. Welfare recipients would be required to cooperate with efforts to collect child support. And teen-age mothers must finish their education and live with an adult to qualify for welfare payments.
In exchange for what Mrs. Whitman calls "personal responsibility," she promises incentives that will persuade beneficiaries to take the lower-paying jobs, including allowing them to keep 50 percent of their income while maintaining benefits, up to $850 a month.
She also said that she would double the state's investment to provide a "support system" to keep recipients employed by expanding child care, offering transportation and continuing a program that extends Medicaid for two years after a welfare recipient moves off the rolls.
"The change on emphasis is work," Mrs. Whitman said after touring Future Works. "You have to start somewhere. We want to move people off welfare."
But Mrs. Whitman, whose proposal must be approved by the Legislature and Federal Government, has not persuaded many advocates for welfare beneficiaries that minimum-wage jobs are the answer. "You need education," said Felicia Sallie, a case manager at the Anna M. Sample Family Shelter in Camden. "You need the skills to get the kinds of jobs that will allow you to support yourself. No one can live on $5.05 an hour."
Mrs. Whitman defended her plan, saying that previous state programs to wean beneficiaries off welfare "have failed." She also noted that a new Federal flexibility had presented more opportunity to the states.
"We need to keep trying," Mrs. Whitman said. "There is a revolution going on in Washington. I went to my Commissioner of Human Services and said, 'Design me the ideal welfare program if we had block grants."
There are now 35 states with Federal waivers for 50 demonstration programs around the country. Of them, 17 states have imposed some kind of limit on benefits. In Connecticut, Gov. John G. Rowland began imposing a 21-month limit last year. Fourteen states now require welfare recipients to cooperate in identifying parents who neglect to pay child support. Twenty states have parental responsibility programs, from requiring teen-age mothers to stay in school or risk losing benefits to demanding that parents make sure their children attend school.
The New Jersey Commissioner of Human Services, William Waldman, said that he had taken some ideas from other states and dismissed others. Unlike New York State, New Jersey is not seeking to reduce benefits for single men after 60 days. "Sometimes the people on general assistance may be family connected," Mr. Waldman said. "They may be fathers. You can't just ignore them."
The Whitman administration's goal is for 15 percent of recipients to move off the welfare rolls within five years. But Mrs. Whitman also said that she had not included any more money to pay for these expanded support programs in her new proposed $16 billion budget. She said the money for these programs would come from savings elsewhere in the state's $1 billion welfare system. She cited, as an example, consolidating welfare offices and slashing administrative costs. Counties now administer benefits that average $424 a month to 117,000 families; municipalities distribute benefits that average $140 a month to 35,021 single adults and childless couples. The administration estimates the state could save $25 million by shutting municipal welfare offices and turning that responsibility over to the counties.
Exactly what these changes mean for a training program like Future Works and its 118 participants is unclear. The year-old program has helped 41 of 44 people who completed training find jobs, with an average hourly wage of $8.05, but no one can say how many of those will return to welfare. It cost about $7,000 to train each person.
Unlike many training programs, Future Works designs its courses based on the needs of local businesses. So, when a local hospital recently laid off 31 billing clerks, the program dropped medical billing and offered medical office administration and customer service training.
Maryann Amore, vice president of the Work Group, the nonprofit organization that runs Future Works, said the group's $1.7 million budget was recently cut by $330,000. While she said Mrs. Whitman spoke favorably about the program, Ms. Amore said she worried about the state's commitment to offer the level of training that welfare recipients need to get that first job. "It is a concern because people need so many skills," she said. "If there were entry-level jobs for everyone, this would be less of a problem."
Elena Roman, 21, was sitting across the room from Ms. Scott, using the yellow pages to call businesses for a job as a receptionist. She had just completed an office automation and administration training course and her instructors said she was one of their best students. Ms. Roman has been receiving public assistance since giving birth three years ago. She said that she was able to participate in the program because of state-financed day care for her son. "He is learning there and this has been good for me," Ms. Roman said. "I have upgraded my skills. I believe there is going to be a job for me."
She worries, however, that a minimum-wage position, even with some benefits continuing, would not allow her to provide for her son. "I want to be able to afford to pay my bills, so I don't have to fall back into the system."
Of the more than 50,000 new jobs created in New Jersey last year, only 2,000 were in Camden County. This year, the Whitman administration is projecting that 10,000 fewer jobs will be created statewide.
Several women at Future Works who were interviewed after the Governor left said they agreed with limiting benefits, as long as decent-paying jobs -- and training to qualify for them -- were available.
"I am going to make it," Ms. Scott said. "I have fears and sorrows for those people who don't have the chance or who won't take advantage of the opportunities for training or for getting a job."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Refunding Dominates Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were mixed yesterday as the market is facing the task of absorbing a huge supply of new debt securities this week.
With market participants wondering if investor demand will be weak at this week's quarterly sales by the Treasury, primary dealers -- securities firms required to bid at all Government sales -- were setting up and busy discounting prices as they often do to raise yields and try to insure that the securities will be attractive to investors. 
 The yield spread between the 2-year note and 30-year bond widened in a sign that investors are betting that the Federal Reserve will continue to lower short-term interest rates. Two weeks ago, the spread was 102 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point; at the close of the New York session yesterday, it was 122 basis points.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 3/32 , to 10925/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.15 percent, from 6.16 percent on Friday. Traders said the long bond was bolstered by tumbling energy prices and a retreat in gold prices.
With a mountain of new supply coming to market, investors will likely wait out the dealers to buy at the lowest prices. The Treasury plans to sell a record $44.5 billion of notes and bonds in addition to yesterday's regular weekly auction of bills and a sale of cash-management bills on Thursday. Three-year notes will be auctioned today, and 10-year notes will be sold tomorrow.
Rates at yesterday's weekly bill auction fell to their lowest levels in about a year and a half, after last week's interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
The average rate for a three-month bills was 4.88 percent, down from 5.01 percent last week and the lowest since 4.79 percent on Sept. 26, 1994, while the average for a six-month issue was 4.79 percent, down from 4.90 percent last week and the lowest since 4.75 percent on Aug. 1, 1994.
In when-issued trading ahead of the Government's quarterly sales, the 3-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.06 percent, up 3 basis points since last week, while the 10-year issue was priced to yield 5.68 percent, up 11 basis points. The yield on the 30-year bond has gained 12 basis points, to 6.09 percent.
There were no big economic reports yesterday, and the only report scheduled today is the Johnson Redbook Service report on retail and chain store sales.
Yesterday's decline in gold prices and in the Commodity Research Bureau index of 17 commodities -- whose recent gains have raised inflation alarms -- did nothing to shake the market's uneasiness.
According to some economists, the movement in the price of gold has not always been a good indicator. "But since financial markets often fluctuate in response to changing perceptions instead of fiscal rigor," said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors, "the market may continue to exhibit overt signs of skittishness if the upward movement in the price of gold persists." Wayne Schmidt, a fixed-income portfolio manager with Mimlic Asset Management in St. Paul, said the market's biggest concern was supply. "There's not much in the way of economic numbers this week," he explained, "so everyone is zeroing in on supply. Right now, it seems as if it's just a waiting game, with the fear of getting supply placed into the hands of investors the greatest concern."
Dealers do not relish holding large inventories on their shelves, exposing them to losses if rates should surge higher.
In the corporate debt market, the Philip Morris Companies yesterday sold $400 million of 10-year notes due on Feb. 6, 2006, through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The noncallable issue is rated A2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. Given a 6.375 percent coupon, the notes were priced at 99.925 to yield 6.385 percent, or about 70 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity.
The low spread, market analysts said, confirmed that investors found the issue attractive.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.766	97.578	Discounted Rate	4.88%	4.79%	Coupon Yield	5.03%	4.99%	High Price	98.772	97.589	Discounted Rate	4.86%	4.77%	Coupon Yield	5.00%	4.97%	Low Price	98.766	97.578	Discounted Rate	4.88%	4.79%	Coupon Yield	5.03%	4.99%	Accepted at low price	90%	33%	Total applied for	$56,610,959	$61,014,222	Accepted	$16,210,440	$16,443,724	Noncompetitive	$1,626,472	$1,357,192	
 
Both issues are dated Feb. 8, 1996. The three-month bills mature on May 9, and the six-month bills mature on Aug. 8.

HEADLINE: The Doctor's World;
New AIDS Therapies Arise, But Who Can Afford the Bill?

BYLINE: By By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Shortly after AIDS was first recognized in 1981, activists demanded: give us new therapies. Now the latest worry of activists and many others concerned about the costs of health care is: who can afford them?
A five-day meeting on H.I.V. and related viruses here last week made it clear that the treatment of AIDS is entering a new phase, much more complex, perhaps more effective and certainly more costly. 
 The latest development is a class of drugs known as protease inhibitors. Short-term studies show the combination of these new drugs with standard older ones is the most potent therapy against H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. As Dr. David Cooper, a leading AIDS researcher from Sydney, Australia, put it, the new phase involves "the ascendancy of combination therapy" and "the demise" of single-drug therapy for H.I.V.
But the combination anti-H.I.V. therapy costs $12,000 to $18,000 a year. The many other medications that patients with advanced AIDS may need for related conditions could raise the bill to $70,000.
Many doctors expect heavy promotional pressure to treat more H.I.V. patients earlier in the course of the infection than is now the case. Since several hundred thousand Americans are infected, though many do not know it, the increased costs could be substantial.
Private health insurance plans will cover the drug costs for some AIDS patients. Medicaid covers the drugs for many others, although the number of individual drugs covered each month may be restricted. For others, the drug costs may be covered by the drug assistance program under the Ryan White act, the Federal program for treatment of AIDS patients. And many others may have to pay out of pocket if they can.
None of the new treatments are a cure for AIDS, although some of the initial results seem to show striking benefits. One study reported last week found that the combination of an experimental protease inhibitor and two older drugs, AZT and 3TC, suppressed the amount of H.I.V. in the body to levels that cannot be detected by the latest laboratory techniques. The effect is more powerful than many would have dreamed possible when the studies began only a few months ago.
The AIDS virus still remains in the body, but the hope is that if H.I.V. does not become resistant to the drugs and they can be given safely for many years, AIDS can be treated successfully as a chronic disease.
Increased cost is only one of the challenges that new treatments and new hope pose for researchers, doctors and patients. But there are others as well -- the ever present difficulty of squandering the effectiveness of new treatments by using them in a way that fosters resistant strains of the AIDS virus, and a related need to conduct controlled studies to know which combinations of drugs work best.
How much costs will increase is not clear. The Food and Drug Administration has so far approved only one protease inhibitor, Roche's saquinavir, for marketing. It costs about $7,000 a year. Merck and Abbott have asked the drug agency for permission to market their experimental protease inhibitors, indinavir and ritonavir, which they promoted heavily at the meeting. But they declined to say how much the drugs would cost. And the agency will have much more information to evaluate than was presented here before approving either drug.
As two of the meeting's main scientific organizers, Dr. Robert T. Schooley of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver, and Dr. Douglas D. Richman of the University of California at San Diego, both cautioned at a news conference, "The devil is in the details."
Nonetheless, costs will undoubtedly rise, and budgets may not. Dr. Harold W. Jaffe, an official of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who also treats AIDS patients at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, said, "just in the last few months in our clinic at Grady, we have gone from one to two drugs as the standard initial treatment" and may go to three. "But we have a fixed pharmacy budget, so what are we going to not supply in order to accommodate these new drugs?" he asked.
Other important studies show that a new test that measures the amount of H.I.V. in the body can provide a more accurate way to predict the course of H.I.V. infection. Researchers suggested that the test would allow them to establish categories of progression of H.I.V. infection, as is done with some cancers, in hope of making drug therapy more effective.
But that important development has raised further concern about the costs of the new AIDS care. The Food and Drug Administration has not approved the test for marketing, although it is used extensively in research. The test is expected to cost about $200, would need to be repeated about four times a year and, if approved, would be added to many others that are now used.
"Because of the patient advocacy for AIDS, there will be a lot of pressure to make the standard of care a very expensive one," Dr. Jaffe said in an interview. "It won't just be individuals asking questions. It will be organized community groups pushing for this higher standard."
After the meeting, the AIDS Action Council in Washington, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation in Los Angeles, and a group of 20 leading non-government AIDS researchers and clinicians warned that the costs of the new therapies might make them unaffordable for the vast majority of Americans infected with H.I.V.
Dr. Charles Farthing of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation said that while the range of treatments had expanded and the number of people needing treatment had grown, budget constraints had forced state and Federal programs to cut back on the number of drugs for which they would pay.
These advocates urged drug companies to lower the costs of protease inhibitors and private insurers to cover the new drugs and the monitoring tests that are required. And they called on the Federal Government to increase financing for the new drugs through the Ryan White act.
If the source of payment for the new drugs is not clear, the goals of their use are, to "lower the virus load as much as possible to undetectable levels as long as possible," said Dr. Emilio Emini, who helped develop Merck's indinavir. But that means determining which combinations are the safest, most effective and most economical -- something that is not known. And that raises the challenge of designing and conducting experimental studies, something that has been difficult in the past.
Early on in AIDS treatment, scientists pinned their hopes on single drug therapy. But AZT, the first licensed anti-H.I.V. drug, had an extremely limited ability to reduce the amount of virus in the body, and resistance quickly became a factor.
In infections like tuberculosis and some cancers, combinations of drugs overcame resistance and achieved cures. So AIDS researchers began looking to combinations of anti-H.I.V. drugs. The combinations now used against H.I.V. are numerous. There were at least seven in a study of ritonavir in which patients continued to take whatever licensed drugs they were taking. But that study was not designed to determine which combination was most effective.
Dr. Cooper, the Australian expert, said that "unless doctors cooperate, there is a serious danger that our patients will receive anecdotal combinations," meaning that doctors will rely on accounts of treatment of individuals or small groups rather than data from large clinical trials. In other words, doctors must be willing to refer patients to such trials and patients must be willing to enter them. Without such cooperation, Dr. Cooper said, "the renewed optimism in therapy shown in recent months will turn sour, as it has done in previous years."
Future studies need to address many thorny questions about when to start combination treatment. Should it be as soon as infection is detected? Are there groups of H.I.V.-infected people who would benefit from aggressive therapy and other groups who would benefit from watchful waiting? What should be done for those who have been taking one anti-H.I.V. drug for a long time and seem to be doing well? And will patients respond to a second protease inhibitor if they develop resistance to the first?
Answers to those questions can come only from well-designed trials, which the National Institutes of Health intend to help develop, Dr. William Paul, who heads the Federal office of AIDS research, said in an interview.
But AIDS activists have vigorously opposed such studies in the past because a controlled study inevitably includes a group that receives a new, supposedly powerful treatment, and, for comparison, a group that does not receive the new treatment. Thus, some patients may lose out in the short run. But without such studies, researchers argue, knowledge that is necessary for the long run is never gained. The benefits of valuable drugs, like those used to treat tuberculosis, have been lost through misuse, and many AIDS experts are determined not to add protease inhibitors to the list.
One priceless piece of information that careful studies would yield is exactly how much of each drug should be used in a combination. A danger in not gaining such information is that if protease inhibitors are given in amounts that are too small, they can lead to the emergence of resistant H.I.V. strains. Dr. Richman of San Diego, a virologist, said such strains might already exist. Scientists have learned that H.I.V. strains resistant to AZT and some protease inhibitors existed before the drugs were ever given to AIDS patients.
Thus, drug treatment can lead to the emergence of resistant strains.
To prevent the emergence of resistance in long-term drug therapy it is necessary to completely suppress the virus's ability to replicate, since continuous replication is what allows a viral strain to produce enough mutations so that some will be resistant and help it survive, experts say.
As such difficulties in developing treatments make clear, the best way to treat AIDS has always been to prevent it. In this area there are also reasons for cautious hope.
Dr. Susan A. Fiscus and her team from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University in Durham found that use of AZT among pregnant women and their infants significantly reduced the incidence of H.I.V. infection in those babies in North Carolina.
Two years ago, a study showed that AZT given to pregnant women and their newborns prevented AIDS in a significant number of the infants. But in part because it often takes a long time for doctors to put many new findings into practice, many questioned whether the benefits achieved in the study would apply to everyday medical practice.
Dr. Fiscus's team found that the proportion of H.I.V.-exposed children in North Carolina who were identified and tested increased to 90 percent in the last quarter of 1994 from 60 percent in 1993. The infection rate among babies born to infected mothers fell to 8.5 percent in 1994 from 21 percent in 1993. Babies born to mothers who took the drug had an infection rate of 5.7 percent, as against 18.9 percent in untreated babies.
Similar findings were seen among pregnant women in a federally financed study in several cities.
Another recent report in The Lancet of a randomized trial in six communities in rural areas of Tanzania showed that treatment of sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis and gonorrhea reduced the incidence of H.I.V. infection by about 40 percent. The study showed convincingly for the first time that the concept of controlling sexually transmitted diseases to control H.I.V. worked in the general population.
Ideally, the most effective anti-H.I.V. drugs would safely keep the virus in check for a lifetime and prevent development of infections that occur as complications of AIDS. It is these complications, which occur as a result of weakened immune systems, that usually debilitate and kill AIDS patients. The savings from the therapies and care needed to deal with these opportunistic infections would probably be greater than the high costs of the ideal drugs.
Although protease inhibitors can significantly raise blood levels of critical immune cells, like CD-4 and CD-8 cells, there was little talk of them as the ideal anti-H.I.V. drugs. Much discussion was about using the latest findings as a spur to develop additional drugs. And no one knew how the total bill would be paid.


GRAPHIC: The newest way of attacking the AIDS viurs is to use three drugs, one a new protease inhibitor that strikes at a late stage in the virus's life cycle. Intial tests of this combination therapy are encouraging.

HEADLINE: New York's Thin, Angry Blue Line

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
Since he began campaigning for the job he now holds, Rudolph W. Giuliani has modeled himself as a Mayor every police officer could be proud of. He made crime and "quality of life" central themes of the campaign and now considers among his greatest accomplishments a stunning drop in murders, car thefts and other offenses.
But these days, many police officers see the Mayor in a different light. Officer Luis Rivera, 37, of the Bronx, for instance, is angry that Mr. Giuliani is opposing legislation that would raise officers' salaries."Giuliani pays his managers raises to keep the best, but that doesn't hold for us," he said. "The honeymoon is over." 
 Another Bronx officer, Steve Mattioli, 32, also said he felt underappreciated. "I feel good work is not rewarded as it should be," he said, "unless it serves a political role or serves as good public relations."
And Lieut. Lawrence Hotaling, commander of the detective squad in Flatbush, Brooklyn, grumbled that recent cuts in overtime had hamstrung investigations. "If I disclosed which cases have been impacted I'd be back in uniform in no time," he said. "Sometimes I feel like I don't have enough fingers, and the dike is about to fall in."
While the Mayor's popularity among the city's police and their unions -- a solid base of support during his 1993 campaign -- appears to be falling fast, some police officials worry that the disaffection in the ranks has created significant morale problems that could affect officers' performance.
In interviews with more than 30 officers throughout New York City, every one criticized Mr. Giuliani, and many complained that Commissioner William J. Bratton was too concerned with attracting publicity.
While many expressed pride in their new dark blue uniforms and the innovative tactics Mr. Bratton is using to fight crime, the vast majority had complaints about pay. Many criticized the department's efforts to cut overtime, a move that amounts to an average annual loss of $2,500 for an officer with a base yearly salary of a little more than $30,000. Others complained about Mr. Giuliani's budget proposal to cut 1,500 of the force's 38,000 officers.
But officers reserved their most severe criticism for the opposition of Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Bratton to a state arbitration bill that many officers say would help narrow the broad gap between what they are paid and what officers make in the suburbs. A 10-year veteran of the city force makes about $43,600 a year, according to union figures; in Suffolk and Nassau counties, the same officer would make about $59,500.
The arbitration bill would shift jurisdiction over contract disputes involving police officers from the city's Office of Collective Bargaining to the State Public Employees Relations Board, which the police union believes would be more generous. Mr. Giuliani opposes the bill, known by the acronym Perb, which he says would cost the city more than $200 million a year.
"I thought everything was going fine until the Mayor came out against the Perb," said Officer Robert Crespi, who works in Harlem. "If they want us to act like professionals, they should pay us like professionals."
To be sure, none of the officers interviewed suggested that they wanted to return to the days of David N. Dinkins, who as Mayor won the enmity of many officers for his support of an all-civilian board to review complaints against officers and an independent panel to investigate charges of police corruption.
Moreover, many of those interviewed said they liked their jobs better today than before Mayor Giuliani took office, in large part because they believed their new anti-crime tactics were producing historic results.
But they still said that the Mayor and Commissioner had let them down.
Mr. Bratton said that labor complaints had become so powerful a distraction for his officers that when he visited two officers with bullet wounds in the hospital last week "they brought up the subject of Perb and pay."
"Money is definitely on their minds," Mr. Bratton said. "Their average salary is $30,000 to $31,000 a year. You can't live in the city on that. The Mayor is in a tough spot. The money is not there."
For his part, Mr. Giuliani said he could support police raises "in the same way that other unions have been given raises -- in exchange for productivity gains."
"I believe the police officer on the beat does not understand that the P.B.A. has been unwilling to negotiate raises in exchange for productivity gains," he said, "and that I cannot allow a union to wreak this kind of havoc on the city."
Several precinct union delegates and middle-level police managers, who spoke on the condition that their names not be used, warned that deteriorating morale could easily prompt a series of work actions similar to the 10-day slowdown in parking and traffic ticketing in December that cost the city several million dollars.
Even worse, they said, the grumbling is dampening enthusiasm within the ranks about a new anti-drug effort Mr. Bratton is planning.
Morale problems, Lieutenant Hotaling said, "definitely have an impact on crime fighting."
The work slowdown in December was a response to Mr. Giuliani's successful effort to convince Gov. George E. Pataki to veto a similar arbitration bill last year. The new measure is now on the Governor's desk, and the Mayor has warned that if it is signed he may be forced to cut thousands more officers. That has prompted leaders of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association to threaten to withhold support for the Mayor's re-election bid.
"He's not in our good graces now," said Louis Matarazzo, the P.B.A. president. "We're not endorsing anyone now."
Clearly, the union has helped stir up the emotions of many officers. Union delegates have pasted newspaper articles on the walls of nearly every precinct about how the Mayor and Police Commissioner have opposed the arbitration bill.
But Thomas A. Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, said he was concerned that the bad feelings ran far deeper than union-inspired badmouthing of management. "Officers would be less than human to think they did not deserve a substantial raise after accomplishing the great fall in crime over the last two years," he said. "That could translate into a morale problem."
As remarkable as the unanimity of opinion among the 30 officers interviewed was the sharpness of their language about their superiors -- an act almost akin to insubordination when spoken with the knowledge that their names would be published.
"We're supposed to be the backbone of this city, and they're paying us like we do nothing," said Officer Frank Frontera, 32, a member of a robbery squad in the 70th Precinct in Brooklyn.
"We're getting compared to people who clean bedpans," he added, noting that police salaries -- particularly the $350 rookies take home each week, after taxes -- have fallen behind inflation over the last decade.
Speaking of Commissioner Bratton, Officer Jim Bennett, a 30-year-old veteran of the 48th Precinct in the East Tremont section of the Bronx, said: "The guy is not getting on the cover of Time magazine for nothing. They want us to do the job so they can wave the flag."
Resentment toward the Mayor is palpable even in squads known for their diligence, like the community policing unit of the 84th Precinct, whose undercover burglary and anti-prostitution tactics have won widespread praise in Brooklyn Heights and helped improve the image of downtown Brooklyn.
Officer Leslie Richardson, 37, whose undercover poses as a jewelry thief have stung numerous Brooklyn fences and won her a Detective's Achievement Award last week, is a rising star in the department. But she expressed extreme disappointment in the city's leaders, even if she would not criticize the Mayor and Police Commissioner by name.
"If it were the politicians' own relatives on this job and they went through all the dangerous situations we do," she said, "don't you think we'd get a raise? We matter to them only if they can say rape went down 100 percent this week and it makes them look good."
But not all the concerns involved salaries. Officer Joseph Spicciatie, 35, who works undercover posing as a male prostitute in downtown Brooklyn, said he worried that cost cutting was also hurting crime fighting.
"They are so worried about the overtime," he grumbled. "If you have a current investigation, they make you stop and pick it up the next day. In the meantime, the person you're after may have left town. Or the apartment you want to search -- they'll have the time to clean it out."
Officer Frank Delaney, 38, is a hero among many merchants on Fulton Street after his mapping of a burglary pattern led to the arrest of two Fort Greene men who had committed 80 recent commercial burglaries. But he said he felt underappreciated by his superiors.
Divorced and paying child support, he said: "I can't live like this. I have to figure out what bills to pay this month and which to wait to pay next month. I risk my life day in and day out, and I have the same bills as anybody else, but I'm not paid like a policeman or fireman working in the other suburban counties."

HEADLINE: G.M., Sharing Some Profit, Lifts Dividend

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Deciding to share more of its record profits with shareholders, directors of the General Motors Corporation today raised the quarterly dividend on the company's common stock by a third to 40 cents.
Wall Street analysts had been expecting a dividend increase and said that the company could afford the additional $300 million annual outlay. 
 "It wasn't a big surprise, but it was a positive indicator that G.M.'s board would like to return some of the success of G.M.'s turnaround to the shareholder." said Kenneth A. Blaschke, an auto analyst at Dean Witter.
The dividend announcement came after the closing bell on the New York Stock Exchange, where G.M. shares closed at $52.875 a share, up 87.5 cents.
John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, said that the increased dividend "can be sustained over the long term thanks to the fundamental profitability improvements we've been able to achieve as well as the continued strengthening of our balance sheet and ongoing improvement in our cash position."
General Motors announced last Tuesday that it earned profits of $6.88 billion in 1995, including a fourth-quarter profit of $1.87 billion, both records for the company. But the company is also facing high costs as it introduces several new midsize sedans over the next year and a half.
The Ford Motor Company has found over the last six months that these costs, running into the hundreds of billions of dollars, can severely erode profitability.
G.M.'s cash reserves are large, but not remarkably so for a company with $168.83 billion in revenue last year that competes in an industry known for huge swings as the economy rises and falls. General Motors, the world's biggest auto maker, had $10.9 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand at the end of last year. The reserves are up from $8.8 billion at the end of last September and little changed from the end of 1994, when they were $11 billion.
The dividend increase by G.M. is likely to raise the pressure on Ford to raise its quarterly dividend, which is 35 cents a share. Although Ford sold 23 percent fewer vehicles last year, it held $12.4 billion in cash at the end of last year. Indeed, Mr. Blaschke said he expected Ford to raise its dividend later this year.
Officials at Ford have defended the size of its hoard as necessary protection for a recession, although they predict that the economy will continue to grow this year.
General Motors raised its quarterly dividend to the current level of 30 cents from 20 cents last spring.
The General Motors board also raised the quarterly dividend for the company's class E common stock, which is linked to the earnings of EDS, a General Motors subsidiary that provides computer processing and advice to governments and companies. The dividend rose to 15 cents a share from 13 cents.
The board also raised the dividend on class H common stock to 24 cents a share from 23 cents. The class H stock is linked to G.M.'s Hughes Electronics subsidiary.
All of the new dividends are payable on March 9 to shareholders of record on Feb. 15.
The company also said it was calling its series C preferred stock in a move related to G.M.'s plans to spin off its EDS subsidiary. The terms encourage series C owners to convert their shares to G.M.'s class E common stock, Mr. Blaschke said. G.M. said it would pay $52.42 a share for the series C stock. But each share is also convertible into 1.4078 shares of G.M.'s class E stock, and based on today's closing price, each would be worth $78.84. Investors have until Feb. 22 to choose, after which G.M. will automatically redeem the shares.

HEADLINE: Assembly Democrats Press for Records on Pataki's Inaugural Funding

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Setting the stage for a confrontation with the Pataki administration, Assembly Democrats threatened today to subpoena records from two former officers of the private corporation that raised at least hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Governor's lavish three-day inauguration last year.
Charging that the administration had repeatedly rebuffed their efforts to obtain the corporation's records, the Democrats also announced today that they planned to hold public hearings next month at which they would try to compel many of the Republican Governor's closest aides to testify about fund raising for the inaugural. 
 "Maybe they can't give us documents, but when called to testify, they could give us their view on how this corporation operated," said Assemblyman Paul Tokasz, a Buffalo Democrat and chairman of the Elections Committee, one of three Assembly committees investigating the inauguration.
The private corporation, called Inaugural '95, was formed just after Mr. Pataki's election in 1994 to raise money for his inauguration so that no taxpayer dollars would have to be spent. At the time, Zenia Mucha, the Governor's director of communications, said the corporation would abide by state campaign contribution limits and disclose the names of all donors.
But the corporation did neither, allowing many companies to give more than is allowed under state campaign laws and then, in November, announcing that it would not release a list of contributors or any accounting of its activities.
Last month, the three Assembly committees sent letters to over a dozen Pataki advisers and Republican officials requesting records relating to Inaugural '95.
Mr. Pataki's aides contend that the corporation, which was dissolved in November, raised about $600,000. But the Democrats, based on their conversations with some contributors, say the total was closer to $1.4 million.
In almost every case, the Pataki advisers -- including three state commissioners as well as the Governor's director of communications, counsel and chief of staff -- either said that they had none of the records or failed to answer at all.
In response, the Democrats today sent a second round of letters to Lawrence Kalkstein, the inaugural corporation's lawyer, and Charles J. Palombini, the corporation's former chief officer.
"It is imperative that you immediately comply with our requests," the Democrats' letter said. "Your failure to do so will render the issuance of a subpoena necessary."
Democratic officials said they would give the two men a week to comply before issuing the subpoenas.
In an interview today, Mr. Kalkstein declined to say whether he would fight a subpoena in court. But he said the Democrats had no right to the documents they were demanding. "I told them they are not entitled to anything," he said. "We didn't do charitable work or any work that would require public disclosure. There is no reason for the government to interfere with the operation of a private client."
But Democrats contend that the corporation served a fundamentally political purpose and should abide by state campaign finance laws.
Ms. Mucha called the Democrats' demand "beyond sad." Ms. Mucha herself has been asked for records and said that she had none.
"Both the Board of Elections and the Attorney General have said these committees have fully complied with the law, have paid their taxes," Ms. Mucha said. "It's time to move on."
Calls to Mr. Palombini's office were not returned.
In late December, Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco, a Republican, said he believed that the inauguration corporation and a second corporation, Transition '95, set up to help finance the Governor's transition to the office, had not violated any laws.
However, State Sen. Richard A. Dollinger, a Rochester Democrat who had requested Mr. Vacco's inquiry, criticized Mr. Vacco's findings as partisan and called on him to appoint an independent investigator. Mr. Vacco refused.
Ms. Mucha said in November that the names of contributors had been kept secret not just from the public but also from Mr. Pataki and his advisers so that they would not feel pressured to do favors for donors.
But Democrats charged that Mr. Pataki's aides were actually worried that disclosing donors' names would lead to embarrassing revelations about inaugural contributors receiving favorable treatment from the administration.
The Democrats also expressed doubts that Mr. Pataki's advisers had as little knowledge of Inaugural '95 as they have claimed, noting several links between the corporation and the administration.
Mr. Palombini is one of Mr. Pataki's chief campaign fund-raisers. Mr. Kalkstein is a partner in the Peekskill law firm that the Governor's chief counsel, Michael C. Finnegan, once belonged to. Robert Boyle, the corporation's original chief officer, was appointed by Mr. Pataki to be chairman of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. And state Commissioner of Economic Development, Charles A. Gargano, was chairman of the committee that arranged many inaugural events.
Mr. Gargano was also Mr. Pataki's chief fund-raiser in the 1994 campaign. Mr. Gargano said today that some of his fund-raising knowledge might have "rolled over" into his work for the inauguration. But he said he was not an officer of Inaugural '95 and had none of its records.

HEADLINE: POLITICS;
Looking for Mr. Outside

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: LE MARS, Iowa, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The tensions within the Republican Party that hindered its efforts to advance a legislative agenda on Capitol Hill last year are showing up in the struggle for the party's Presidential nomination this year. They provide one key to understanding the surge of Steve Forbes in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two often pivotal states that vote later this month.
All the Republican hopefuls describe themselves as conservatives, but these days that description conceals more than it reveals. Of course, they share some views -- notably the conviction that the bureaucracy in Washington is evil. In the post-cold-war world, the bureaucracy has replaced Communism as the enemy that pulls the party together. 
 But they differ sharply on such questions as a balanced-budget amendment, term limits, abortion, homosexuality and tax policy, and it is Mr. Forbes, in terms of issues as well as background, who stands apart from the crowd.
Mr. Forbes and Patrick J. Buchanan, the commentator, go much further than their rivals in picturing government itself as the principal problem. In his stump speeches, Mr. Forbes ridicules not only bureaucrats but lawyers, politicians, lobbyists and journalists. He said this morning in Sioux City that "the whole culture of Washington" works overtime to throw "obstacles, road blocks and barriers" in the path of "the desires, ambitions and dreams of the American people."
Lamar Alexander, the former Governor of Tennessee, sees Washington as a villain, but he thinks the answer is to transfer its responsibilities back to state governments, which he considers more efficient. Bob Dole and Richard G. Lugar, one a legislative craftsman, the other a policy wonk, are career insiders, and Phil Gramm, once an academic economist, has long since earned his inside-the-Beltway credentials.
So it is Mr. Forbes and Mr. Buchanan, neither of whom has ever held elective office, who can most credibly appeal to the broad group of Americans who think the answer to the country's ills is someone who comes to Presidential politics unsullied by the calculations and the compromises of a political career.
Many of them supported Ross Perot four years ago and voted for doctors and businessmen making their electoral debuts in the Congressional elections two years ago.
Emboldened by that constituency, many of the freshman House members have taken an extreme antigovernment posture, opposing all compromise. That brought them into conflict first with Mr. Dole and his Senate colleagues and eventually with Speaker Newt Gingrich and other senior Republicans in the House as well.
The old notion that expertise is as important for a President as it is for a surgeon or or a physicist is rejected by many voters. Disgusted with career politicians, Bill Thorpe, an 84-year-old retired architect, said he had come to hear Mr. Forbes "because he hasn't held any office, because he doesn't know his way around and he doesn't know the ropes."
Years in the trenches used to be the only apprenticeship for would-be Presidents. But television has made Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Forbes well enough known to run for President without first serving in lesser office -- years as a talk-show host and panelist for Mr. Buchanan, saturation television commercials for Mr. Forbes. Mr. Buchanan is the glowering outsider of this campaign, Mr. Forbes the smiling outsider, which may be why Mr. Forbes's approval ratings are higher.
Attitudes toward term limits, one of the reforms most popular with the new Republican majority of November 1994, offer a clue here. Mr. Alexander favors a part-time Congress; he wants to move the action to the state legislatures. Mr. Dole and Mr. Gramm favor term limits, but not retroactive ones. In other words, they would exempt themselves and their colleagues in Congress. Mr. Lugar opposes term limits outright; Mr. Forbes and Mr. Buchanan are unqualified supporters.
Mr. Forbes is an odd man out when it comes to economics, too.
Like Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, Mr. Forbes is a devotee of supply-side doctrines; they share an adviser in Jude Wanniski, an economic theoretician and unapologetic fan of Reaganomics. Alone among the major Republican candidates, Mr. Forbes opposes a balanced-budget amendment, arguing that the deficit can best be eliminated through economic growth spurred by lower taxes. Hence his flat-tax proposal, which has formed the centerpiece of his campaign.
Mr. Buchanan parts from his brethren in bitterly attacking the North American Free Trade Agreement, which they back. He and Mr. Gramm have flat-tax proposals of their own, but they are less flat than Mr. Forbes's. Only Mr. Forbes the nonpolitician has a tax so flat as to countenance the serious political heresy of ending the deductions for home mortgages and charitable contributions.
And then there is social policy, notably the abortion issue.
Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Gramm have dwelt at length on their fierce opposition to abortion, and Senator Bob Dole staged a special event in Dubuque Saturday, appearing with Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, an antiabortion crusader, to re-emphasize his antiabortion bona fides. Suspect in some conservatives' eyes because he has refused to sign a pledge to support the party's platform plank, he said he would reverse on his first day in office executive orders issued by President Clinton that are "forcing abortion even further into American life."
Mr. Forbes has sought to straddle the abortion issue. He said last September on the NBC program "Meet the Press" that he wanted "to help create an environment where abortion will wither away." To that end, he has opposed mandatory government funding for abortions and opposed abortion late in pregnancies or for sex selection. Unless underlying social attitudes change, he has been saying during his bus tour of Iowa, making abortion illegal would be no more effective than Prohibition.
Despite Mr. Forbes's best efforts to placate them, the national antiabortion organizations remain unimpressed. Colleen Parro, director of the Republican National Coalition for Life, said over the weekend that the millionaire publisher's position was "based on some nebulous reversal of the moral climate in America, which hasn't happened and isn't going to happen anytime soon."
And abortion-rights campaigners count him as one of them -- or almost so. After Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania dropped out of the Presidential race last November, Ann Stone of Republicans for Choice commented, "Our best person left is Steve Forbes, who's against any regulation in the first trimester."
Mr. Forbes's positions on homosexuality would also seem unacceptable to the Christian right. Asked last month by Armed Forces Journal what he thought of President Clinton's policy on gays in the military, he replied, "On the subject of 'Don't Ask/Don't Tell,' I say: Don't change." Asked last week in central Iowa whether he approved of same-sex marriages, he said he did not, but he added "If you want to live together, fine. If you want to have a life together, fine. But compassion is not approval."
Alone among the major Republican candidates, he has argued that the nation needs more immigrants, not fewer.
"Bill Clinton on many issues would run to the right of Steve Forbes," Mr. Gramm said in New Hampshire on Saturday, but his attempts to paint Mr. Forbes as an apostate, a Rockefeller Republican, appear to have had little impact.
Many potential voters and caucus-goers, including some prominent Christian conservatives, are in a highly pragmatic mood this year, more concerned about beating President Clinton in November than about the candidates' positions.
A measure of the pragmatism that has seized many Republicans here is the presence of Ione Dilley and Marlene Elwell in the Dole camp. Christian activists, both were instrumental in the successful effort several years ago to defeat the Equal Right Amendment in the state, and neither is a natural, died-in-the-wool Dole backer. But as Ms. Elwell said, "Our target is to beat Bill Clinton." Some leading evangelical conservatives were even willing to consider backing Gen. Colin L. Powell, a supporter of abortion rights, had he decided to run.
The rise of the religious right in Iowa has weakened, but not eliminated, moderate Republicans. Eager to strike back, they see an opening with the evangelicals split three or four ways. A number of women who came to hear Mr. Forbes in recent days said they were interested because he was the only candidate not beholden to the antiabortion forces.
In the end, though, it is Mr. Forbes's status as a political newcomer and his advocacy of a flat tax, driven home by $4 million in TV advertising, that has excited Iowans. Many of them know and care to know little else about him.

HEADLINE: 26 Members of Chinese-American Groups in Atlanta Indicted

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Federal law-enforcement officials today charged leaders of several Chinese-American fraternal organizations here with money laundering and drug trafficking, suggesting that these organizations, or "tongs," have been used as fronts for organized crime not only in New York and California but also in the South.
The officials said a primary purpose of the three-year sting operation that led to the indictments was to root out criminal activity before it became entrenched in the tongs. 
 "We don't want it to become what the La Cosa Nostra became in this country," said David W. Johnson Jr., the special agent in charge of the Atlanta office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. "We want to stop it now."
Tongs have been fixtures in the Chinatowns of New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles for much of this century. Organized like traditional secret societies in China, they serve as business and neighborhood associations that provide members with credit unions, social outlets, job referrals and other legitimate services.
But some tongs have also long been known as cover organizations for wide-ranging criminal activities, including gambling, smuggling, drug distribution, prostitution and murder.
The Asian population in the greater Atlanta region more than quadrupled between 1980 and 1990, to 51,820 from 12,529, according to the Census Bureau. Attracted by the warm climate and booming economy, Asians have moved here in large numbers from overseas and from other American cities. As the population has grown, so has membership in the tongs, some of which are chapters of groups based in New York, say leaders of Chinese business and community groups here.
"People go there to socialize," said Godwin Ku, the editor of Chinese Community News, an Atlanta newspaper with 5,000 subscribers in seven Southern states. "Every year they have a Chinese New Year's banquet. I think in New York these tongs are involved with crime maybe. But in Atlanta I don't think so."
Federal authorities emphasized at a news conference today that they did not regard the tongs themselves as criminal organizations. "We are not indicting the tongs as an organization," Mr. Johnson said. "However, some of these are criminal-influenced tongs."
But most of the 26 people whose indictments were announced today were leaders or members of the Hip Sing Tong, the Hung Mung Association, the San Gian Tong and the Fujien Fellowship Association of Southeast America, said Kent B. Alexander, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.
Although the investigation was based in Atlanta, some of those arrested lived in New York; Birmingham, Ala,; Boston; Denver; Ellicott City, Md.; Portland, Ore.; San Francisco; Washington and Wheaton, Md.
One of those arrested on Sunday night was Sui Long Ying, the president of the San Gian Association, whose headquarters are at 25 Division Street in New York's Chinatown. Mr. Ying was charged in both New York and Atlanta with operating an illegal casino in the association's building, and with money laundering.
Federal officials said the drug laundering charges stem from a lengthy undercover operation in which tong members agreed to "wash" more than $500,000 in cash that they were told came from Colombian cocaine trafficking. Drug traffickers typically must invest their profits in businesses, either real or fictitious, to circumvent Federal requirements that banks report deposits of more than $10,000.
Undercover agents, working under the guise of a dummy corporation in Atlanta named Jasmine Inc., invested the purported drug cash in illegal casinos and other gambling operations run by the tong members, Mr. Alexander said. He described how they later received checks and money orders from the defendants for the principal, interest and dividends on their loans.
"Once we advised that we had money available we literally had people knocking at our door seeking to get money from illegal drug trafficking to put into their gambling businesses," said James Deichert, an assistant United States Attorney in charge of the Organized Crime Strike Force here.

HEADLINE: U.N., Facing Bankruptcy, Plans to Cut Payroll by 10%

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb 5

 BODY:
The top financial official of the United Nations said today that the organization is sliding toward bankruptcy and will have to cut about 10 percent of its permanent staff of more than 10,000 people at its headquarters in New York City and in seven foreign cities during the next two years.
The official, Joseph E. Connor, Under Secretary General for Administration and Management, told a General Assembly working group dealing with the financial crisis that by the end of this year the organization is expected to be about $420 million in debt for regular budget expenses alone, not counting peacekeeping operations. 
 The personnel cuts, forced on the United Nations by a combination of reduced budgets and the failure of member nations to pay dues on time, would, for the first time, begin to shrink an organization that has been widely criticized for its bloated bureaucracy and the sinecures provided for underemployed political appointees from around the world.
Even before the cuts begin, the organization's harshest critics were saying they were not enough.
The United Nations secretariat, which includes the organization's permanent bureaucracy but not its independent agencies like Unicef or Unesco, employs 10,150 people, about half of them in New York. Worldwide, 53,589 people work for the United Nations and its related agencies.
More jobs outside the secretariat may be affected if voluntary contributions to agencies continue to be cut by the United States or other governments. Also, thousands of people from professional experts to secretarial support staff who are on fixed-term contracts may not have them renewed. Hiring already has been largely frozen and buyouts are being offered to senior officials.
The failure of the United States to pay its regularly assessed bills has been a major factor in pushing the United Nations into crisis, Mr. Connor said today. He called the American shortfall, now at about $1.5 billion, "very severe."
"The payment situation of one member state is of overwhelming significance," Mr. Connor, an American who was chief executive officer of the Price Waterhouse accounting firm, said today. He added that other nations were also in arrears and that "the total level of unpaid assessments has increased to unprecedented levels."
The total in annual assessments owed to the United Nations by members rose to $2.3 billion by the end of 1995, a jump of $500 million over the previous year. New assessments were levied at the beginning of this year, and American officials were not able to predict when and if these would be paid, Mr. Connor said.
In an interview after his report to the General Assembly working group, Mr. Connor said that how and where personnel cuts are made will be left to individual department heads. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is expected to say more on this subject when he speaks to the same working group on Tuesday or Wednesday.
An advisory panel had earlier suggested that at least 600 secretarial and other support staff should be cut this year, 480 of them in layoffs and the rest through attrition and retirement. The panel also recommended a reduction in 550 professional level jobs, a cut of nearly 14 percent.
A cut in staff may still not be enough to close the budget gap, diplomats say. Last fall, the secretariat asked the General Assembly to approve an operating budget of $2.8 billion for this year and next. The Assembly instead voted a budget of $2.6 billion and then asked the organization to find another $104 million in additional cuts and report back to member states by the end of March.
Last week, Mr. Connor said that the "tough" budget would lead to zero growth in expenditures by the end of 1997, a first for the United Nations.
In making further reductions, the United States is asking the United Nations to look into areas like publications and public information. In an electronic age, diplomats say, there may be too much paper and too many people doing work that could be done by computers. Americans have also suggested turning over some services like translations to private companies.
Looking for longer-term solutions, the European Union and Japan are proposing new methods of assessment that would better reflect changed economic patterns and reduce somewhat the dependency of the United Nations on the United States. Washington is assessed a quarter of the regular United Nations budget and 31 percent of the costs of its peacekeeping operations, a figure Congress unilaterally reduced to 25 percent last year.
The Clinton Administration has welcomed the staff cutbacks as reforms that can be held up to skeptical members of the hostile, Republican-led Congress when the Administration asks for the money to pay its United Nations arrears.
But among many Republicans, where there are occasional calls to withdraw from the United Nations entirely, staff cuts or other money-saving measures may not be enough.
Today Marc Thiessen, spokesman for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that a 10 percent staff cut was "a very, very small start." He said that the committee, chaired by Senator Jesse Helms, had demanded a 50 percent cut in the State Department, and would expect at least that large a cut in the United Nations.
The relationship between Congress and the United Nations -- with the Clinton Administration in the middle -- has recently been further complicated by the introduction of bills two weeks ago that would cut off all money to the organization if it tries to find alternate, independent sources of income.
The bills, among whose sponsors is Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate majority leader and a leading contender for the Republican Presidential nomination, were written after some Republicans heard reports that Secretary General Boutros-Ghali discussed in Britain in January the possibility of levying international taxes to avoid depending on national contributions. Mr. Dole characterized the Secretary General's comments as an example of the United Nations "out-of-control pursuit of power."
Transcripts showed that Mr. Boutros-Ghali, speaking at Oxford University and to the BBC, was referring to suggestions that have been made over several years to impose small levies on international currency transactions or arms sales.
In the interview, Mr. Boutros-Ghali said that only member nations had the power to change the way the United Nations is financed. "We are still an instrument in the hands of the member states," he said.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE CAUCUSES;
Ever So Quietly, G.O.P. Is Beginning to Choose

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: MANDEVILLE, La., Feb. 5

 BODY:
The fact that the first voting of the 1996 Presidential campaign takes place in Louisiana on Tuesday is as much a secret here as the ingredients of Chef Paul Prudhomme's signature debris sauce that graces his beef filet.
In random interviews today with dozens of residents in this Republican enclave on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, about 30 miles from New Orleans, almost no one had heard of the caucuses where voters will choose 21 delegates to the Republican National Convention, more even than in the first primary in New Hampshire. 
 The state's resurgent Republican Party had moved up the date to give Louisiana -- and the South -- more relevance in national politics. But there is little sign of activity: There are few television commercials, even fewer bumper stickers. In this morning's Times-Picayune of New Orleans, the state's dominant newspaper, there was not one word about the caucuses.
"I had no idea there was going to be an election," said Jan Land, 40, who was shopping at a strip mall here. "I've heard not a word. Not anything. You'd think I'd know: I'm a librarian."
Despite the lack of attention, and the fact that only a tiny fraction of registered Republicans are expected to participate, the voting here will be a closely watched showdown between two conservatives, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Patrick J. Buchanan.
"The process is not as important as the result," said Rhett Davis, a consultant to the state Republican Party. "Somebody's going to win and somebody's going to lose -- and the winner will establish momentum going into Iowa and New Hampshire." Louisiana will hold a more traditional primary in March in which eight additional delegates will be selected.
Mr. Gramm and Mr. Buchanan are vying to emerge as the favorite of the most highly charged conservatives who will endure unusually cold weather to make it to 42 caucus sites. Both contenders are looking for a lift before the more crucial competition among all nine candidates in the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 12.
The leading candidates in Iowa and New Hampshire, Senator Bob Dole and Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate, had chosen to boycott the caucuses here to avoid angering voters in those states who wanted to preserve their tradition of holding the first contests. Another candidate who is popular with conservatives, Alan Keyes, is also competing here, though he only qualified to contend for delegates at a limited number of caucus sites.
For months Mr. Gramm, who hails from a neighboring state, was seen as the favorite after assembling the most sophisticated organization here. "I've never seen anyone come in and organize the way he has" Mr. Davis said. "He came in nearly a year ahead of time."
Rather than dampen expectations, Mr. Gramm tells all who will listen that he will triumph on Tuesday. "The people in Iowa are going to look at the Louisiana caucuses as a sort of semifinal to decide who is the real conservative candidate," the Texan said at a campaign stop today in Muscatine, Iowa. "If we win convincingly in Louisiana, that process is going to turn into an avalanche."
But in recent days, Mr. Buchanan has become such a presence that local Republicans joke that he has bought a house in Baton Rouge and a summer home in New Orleans.
"It's the best decision of the campaign to come down here and have a one-on-one battle," Mr. Buchanan said tonight at a crawfish farm in Vinton, a small town on the border with Beaumont, Tex. "Gramm's behaving very overconfidently."
Mr. Buchanan's one coup here came on Friday, when he won the support of Gov. Mike Foster. The Governor's decision may have been influenced by the fact that Mr. Buchanan had hired Mr. Foster's top campaign aides for his campaign. Mr. Buchanan was also the only Presidential candidate to endorse Mr. Foster in the Republican primary last year.
While Mr. Buchanan has been campaigning here for days, Mr. Gramm is confident enough -- or is so concerned about placing well in Iowa -- that he has remained in Iowa and will not return to Louisiana until late on Tuesday for an afternoon of campaigning before voters attend the caucuses in the evening.
Religious conservatives are expected to be particularly active in the caucuses, which have become a testing ground more of social issues than economic ones. While Mr. Gramm has campaigned in most parts of Louisiana, a longtime Democratic bastion, Mr. Buchanan has concentrated on the west side of the Mississippi, particularly in the Catholic regions of southwest Louisiana, where his outspoken opposition to abortion might be especially well received. He has also emphasized his protectionist trade views.
Emile Peppi Bruneau, the Speaker pro tem of the State House of Representatives who backs Mr. Gramm, said that Mr. Buchanan's small core of supporters are enthusiastic but that the Senator has wider appeal. "The fewer people who vote, the better it is for Buchanan," he said.
What was most notable in the random interviews in Mandeville was that among those who said they planned to participate, virtually every person identified Mr. Forbes as his or her favorite candidate -- even though he is not even taking part.
Even the Republicans who know about the caucuses are not entirely impressed. Saying he had only a sketchy notion they were coming up, Wayne Cox, 43, a management consultant here said: "Isn't it something with Louisiana trying to be first? It sounds pretty ludicrous to me."

Firebombing: Putting Blame On Prozac

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
A 90's version of the Twinkie defense holds center stage in the plain, wood-paneled chamber that is Part 72 of State Supreme Court in Manhattan. That is where Edward J. Leary has been on trial for the last week, charged with attempted murder in two subway firebombings that burned and scarred 50 people in December 1994.
The Twinkie defense, you'll recall, was used in behalf of Dan White, a San Francisco Supervisor who killed Mayor George Moscone and a fellow Supervisor, Harvey Milk, in 1979. Psychiatrists for the defense argued that Mr. White's huge intake of sugar-laden junk food, like Hostess Twinkies, heightened his emotional distress to a point where he came unglued. To a degree, their testimony worked. The Supervisor was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter instead of first-degree murder. 
 Midway through this decade when olestra is in, sugar is most definitely out. In Part 72, the modern equivalent is Prozac.
Basically, the defense argument goes like this:
Mr. Leary, a gaunt, pasty-faced man of 50, fell into depression after losing his job as a computer analyst and went to a psychologist who prescribed Prozac together with other drugs. It was a reckless combination, the lawyers say, because it produced a volatile psychotropic cocktail that drove their client mad.
They do not contest that Mr. Leary caused the underground fires on Dec. 15 and Dec. 21, 1994. But they are telling the jurors to forget prosecution claims of a plot to extort money from the Transit Authority. Mr. Leary, they say, had no intention of harming anyone.
THAT includes the more severe incident of Dec. 21, when he boarded a downtown No. 4 train with a volatile cocktail of his own: two jars of gasoline, matches, flashbulbs and a kitchen timer. As it turned out, the device blew up in his face, burning him and dozens of others and turning a routine ride into a purgatory.
This is the latest of many prominent cases in which the defense has held that the accused was either not himself or had motives other than those alleged by prosecutors. To cite but two, Yigal Amir now says in Tel Aviv that he was not trying to murder Yitzhak Rabin last November but sought instead "merely" to paralyze the Israeli Prime Minister by firing three bullets into his back. And closer to home, Colin Ferguson's lawyers tried, though unsuccessfully, to create an argument of "black rage" for why Mr. Ferguson went on a shooting spree that killed six people on the Long Island Rail Road.
Now there's the Prozac defense.
For the most part, this sort of drug defense has not worked in New York, but it is too early to tell this time. While the strategy is at the heart of the case, psychiatric and pharmacological testimony lies ahead. Thus far, the jury has focused on the two subway incidents themselves, especially the one on Dec. 21 and Mr. Leary's flight that day through a tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn. They have heard from police officers, from paramedics and, most of all, from victims themselves, some of whose faces remain horrendously seared from the terror.
ONE of them, Winfield Edey, limped into the courtroom yesterday to recall for the jurors the burst of fire on that No. 4 train, followed by "the most horrible screams you can think of."
Mr. Edey, born in Barbados 61 years ago and living in Far Rockaway, was turned into a human torch, although he testified that in the confusion of the moment he was not even aware for a while that he was on fire. He suffered burns over 67 percent of his body, from head to toe. His face is now a chiaroscuro of browns and whites. His hands, splotched and blistered, may require surgery. He cannot straighten one, and the knuckles of the other do not bend. His feet, he said, were "burned to the bone."
"I don't know what I'm going to do," said Mr. Edey, who has not been able to work since that day. Unemployed truck drivers with hands and feet that do not function right are not in great demand.
"This was one of the most difficult days for me, having to see face to face the man who did this to me," he said after leaving the courtroom. But he bears Mr. Leary no malice, he added, an attitude that brought a frustrated sigh from his wife, Vadna. No, her husband retorted, "There's no point carrying around all that hate."
But that does not mean he accepts the Prozac defense. "If he doesn't come up with a defense like that, what other defense would make any sense at all?" Mr. Edey said as he hobbled out of the courthouse at 100 Centre Street. "When the chips are down, that's the one you use and hope you get away with it."
The only question now is whether the jury agrees.

HEADLINE: Clinton Meets Deadline With an Outline of 1997 Budget

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
With the Federal budget for the current year still far from settled, President Clinton today proposed a $1.64 trillion spending plan for 1997, sketching how he would balance the budget in seven years with a small tax cut. But the Republican-controlled Congress has already dismissed the plan as inadequate.
In contrast with the usual multivolume document of 2,000 pages, the budget that the President released today is a scant 20-page outline. It includes virtually no new proposals, instead repeating the last offer Mr. Clinton made to the Republicans when balanced-budget talks collapsed last month. 
 The White House issued the document today simply to comply with the legal deadline for proposing a budget and to keep pressure on the Republicans to resume negotiations over a broad plan to end the deficit and resolve current spending disputes. It promised to provide by March 18 the usual detailed proposal for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.
"I am very hopeful we can achieve a balanced budget this year," Mr. Clinton said at the White House today, meeting with the governors attending the winter meeting of the National Governors' Association. "I hope we can set aside partisanship and divisions, as you often do in the N.G.A., and provide a balanced budget plan to the American people in the near future."
Mr. Clinton would increase spending about 4 percent from the projected $1.58 trillion in the current fiscal year. Although the budget year is already four months old, many agencies are still operating on a stopgap spending measure that expires next month because Congress and the White House have failed to agree on regular appropriations, and Mr. Clinton did not spell out agency-by-agency plans in his proposal today.
The Republicans, who broke off negotiations last month, have said they will not resume talks until Mr. Clinton produces a more serious proposal, with greater specifics. They argued that his plan failed to force needed cuts in the rise of spending for rapidly growing benefit programs like Medicare and did not provide for adequate tax cuts.
The document released today had so little bearing on the state of the debate that Republican officials, whose fax machines would normally be busily spitting out reactions, barely bothered.
Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, issued a statement calling the proposal "warmed-over status quo." The House Republican leadership branded it "the deja vu budget."
For their part, Democrats have been divided over the President's approach, with liberals in Congress fearing that Mr. Clinton is too ready to compromise, while some moderates have complained that he is still skirting the tough choices.
"What is driving the White House is re-election," former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts said at a news conference of the Concord Coalition Citizens' Council, a bipartisan group he helped found to advocate fiscal discipline. Mr. Tsongas, who was Mr. Clinton's bitter rival in the 1992 Democratic primaries, said the President's plan failed to control spending for entitlement programs like welfare and Medicare and offered tax cuts in the early years while putting off most spending cuts until later years.
"It front-loads the joy and back-loads the pain," Mr. Tsongas said.
Mr. Clinton's document remains a starting point.
"This is not a budget that was ever meant to have a life of its own," said Stan Collender, a budget expert at the Price Waterhouse accounting firm in Washington. "I don't think anyone in the Administration is pretending otherwise. They probably would have been justified in taking more time, but rather than leave themselves open to rhetorical charges that they were late with the budget, they did this."
Under new economic assumptions released today, the White House projected that the gross domestic product would grow 5.1 percent this year and for the next six years, before taking inflation into account. That would compare with an estimated growth of 4.2 percent last year, without adjusting for inflation.
Joseph Stiglitz, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said the Administration believed that the current softness in the economy was the result of temporary factors like the recent Government shutdowns and winter storms and was not a sign of recession.
"We believe we will continue to see noninflationary growth with low unemployment," he said at a White House briefing. "The outlook for the economy is good."

HEADLINE: GOVERNORS GROUP FINDS AGREEMENT ON MEDICAID PLAN

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Leaders of the nation's governors said tonight that they had agreed on a bipartisan proposal on Medicaid, one of the major stumbling blocks in the budget impasse between President Clinton and Republicans in Congress.
The governors, at a conference of the National Governors' Association, said they had also made progress toward a compromise on welfare, another major issue in the budget debate. 
 By themselves, the governors cannot alter Medicaid or welfare policy now set by the Federal Government. But both the White House and Republican leaders in Congress have been looking to them for suggestions about how to overcome the current impasse.
Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, a Republican who is chairman of the association, said he hoped the agreement on Medicaid would be "the catalyst to break the deadlock and get everything else moving."
Under the bipartisan Medicaid proposal offered by the governors, each state would receive a lump sum of Federal money, known as a block grant, to finance health care for the poor. But the proposal would guarantee a package of medical benefits, to be defined in Federal law, to millions of poor people. The proposal thus strikes a compromise between the desire of many Democrats to keep Medicaid as an entitlement and Republican demands for block grants.
Governor Bob Miller of Nevada, a Democrat who is vice chairman of the association, said the negotiators "agreed not to use words that were politically divisive like entitlement and block grant."
Earlier today, the governors met with President Clinton, who said that he and Congress were close to an agreement on "sweeping welfare reform that is very consistent with what the governors have advocated for years."
Many Republicans in Congress have said they will give serious consideration to any proposal approved by their party's governors. President Clinton said in 1992 that he wanted to "end welfare as we know it," but he vetoed a Republican welfare bill last month on the ground that it was too harsh.
The Medicaid compromise, endorsed unanimously by a group of 26 governors this afternoon, will be put to a formal vote at a meeting of all governors on Tuesday, just before President Clinton speaks to the organization. Mr. Thompson predicted that it would be approved by the three-fourths majority needed for such action.
Medicaid finances health care for 37 million poor people, including many children and many residents of nursing homes. Governors have a huge interest in Medicaid because it is financed jointly by the Federal Government and the states, its cost has quadrupled in the last decade and it now accounts for about 20 percent of all state spending. If Republicans succeed in turning much of the authority for Medicaid over to the states, governors will have a larger role in running the program and deciding how to allocate money.
Governor Miller said the Medicaid compromise would give states "a lot of flexibility" to shape their own health programs for the poor. But he said it would also guarantee coverage for certain groups of people, with an assurance that states would get more Federal money if the number of needy people increased because of economic downturns or migration from other states.
Governors outlined their Medicaid proposal to Mr. Clinton at a meeting in the White House this morning. Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, a Democrat, said, "The President looks with favor upon the concepts we laid out, but he needs to see the detail." Mr. Miller said, "The President's reaction seemed to be very positive."
Republican leaders in the House have not seen the details of the proposal. But in the past, they have worked closely with Republican governors and indicated that they would probably support any reconfiguration of Medicaid recommended by those governors.
The Medicaid compromise was negotiated in the last two months by three Republican governors -- Mr. Thompson, John Engler of Michigan and Michael O. Leavitt of Utah -- and by three Democrats -- Mr. Miller, Mr. Romer and Lawton Chiles of Florida.
Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, a Republican, said: "There is an agreement in principle on Medicaid. If we can get it through Congress and the White House, it will have a very positive impact for New York."
In an interview, Mr. Pataki said, "A bipartisan consensus among the governors will go a long way to ending the Federal impasse."
But Medicaid is a notoriously complex program, and it may take weeks of work for Congress to translate the governors' conceptual agreement into legislative language. The legislation must then be evaluated by the Congressional Budget Office, which will assess its cost.
In his 1997 budget, issued today, President Clinton proposed savings of $59 billion in Medicaid in the next seven years. A proposal offered by Republican governors last week would have saved $85 billion. The bipartisan governors' proposal will presumably generate savings somewhere between those alternatives.
A detailed summary of the bipartisan proposal, circulated among governors tonight, says that Medicaid recipients would be assured of coverage for hospital services, doctors' services, nursing home care, family planning services and supplies, laboratory services and X-rays. But, it says, states would have "complete flexibility in defining the amount, duration and scope of services."
The summary of the bipartisan governors' proposal says it has these provisions:
*States would have to provide Medicaid for pregnant women with family incomes up to 33 percent above the official poverty level; for children under 6 in families with incomes up to 33 percent above the poverty line, and for children 6 to 12 in families below the poverty level ($11,821 for a family of three in 1994).
*States would have to provide Medicaid for disabled people. States could define disability, but their definitions would be subject to approval by the Federal Secretary of Health and Human Services.
*Welfare recipients would generally be entitled to Medicaid, as they are under current law.
*People improperly denied Medicaid could appeal to a state agency and could then file suit in state court, with a right of appeal to state courts and then ultimately to the United States Supreme Court.
*States would have "complete authority" to set Medicaid payment rates for health plans, doctors and hospitals, "without interference from the Federal Government or threat of legal action" by health care providers. States would no longer need Federal permission to require Medicaid recipients to enroll in health maintenance organizations, and they would no longer be subject to lawsuits by health care providers demanding higher reimbursement.
*Federal grants to the states for Medicaid would be adjusted for the rising cost of health care and expected changes in the number of poor people. The Federal Government would provide extra money for states with unexpected population growth.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, a Republican, predicted that the governors' agreement "will break the logjam" on Capitol Hill, and she declared that "the needy population is not going to be ignored" by state officials.

HEADLINE: Ford to Offer Cheaper Cars As Sales Sag

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company said today that it would begin selling a lower-cost version of its redesigned Taurus sedan as it reported that its sales of cars and light trucks dropped in January, pushing the pace of total industry sales into negative territory, compared with levels a year ago.
The cheaper Taurus -- which will be $605, or some 3 percent, less than the starting point for a Taurus now -- will be a new car called the Taurus G. It represents the latest retreat by Ford from its strategy of building ever-fancier cars and trucks and charging premium prices for them. Last month, as Taurus sales got off to a disappointing start for the year, Ford announced a $600 rebate through April 2. 
 Ford has poured billions of dollars into developing sophisticated engines, transmissions and suspensions that are costly to manufacture, only to find that it is introducing them when consumers are especially price sensitive.
With sales of Taurus and its sibling, the Mercury Sable, down last month, Ford said that its total sales of cars and light trucks fell 3.4 percent in January from a year earlier. That follows a report on Friday by the Toyota Motor Corporation that its January sales plummeted 17.3 percent from a year earlier. Toyota attributed the decline to a decision to offer fewer discounts this year.
But total-vehicle sales do seem to be holding up at the Chrysler Corporation and, to a lesser extent, the General Motors Corporation. Indeed, G.M. provided another sign of its continuing recovery today as its board voted to increase the quarterly dividend on common stock to 40 cents a share from 30 cents, effective Feb. 15. [Page D9.]
For the entire industry, the negative reports from Ford and Toyota mean that the overall sales rate fell 1.6 percent in January from a year earlier. Percentage calculations are based on a daily selling rate because showrooms were open one more day last month than in January 1995.
The latest data were a contrast to January reports from a dozen other auto makers last Thursday that showed a slight sales gain from a year earlier. Those reports had prompted Wall Street analysts to declare that sales seemed to be relatively resilient despite signs of weakness in the economy.
At Ford, the new Taurus G is scheduled for introduction on April 3, the day after the rebates are set to expire, and will have a base price of $18,545, including destination charges. That compares with $19,150 for the cheapest version of the Taurus GL, the best-selling car in the United States. Ford will also offer a less expensive version of the Mercury Sable, which is quite similar to the Taurus.
Even in the G version, the Taurus will remain more expensive than a Chevrolet Lumina sedan, but less expensive than the Toyota Camry or the Honda Accord. G.M. officials quickly pointed out today that the Lumina price starts at $16,895, which is $1,650 less than the Taurus G. The Lumina is "priced correctly for the marketplace," said William J. O'Neill Jr., a Chevrolet spokesman.
Many car shoppers have said that the new, bubble-shaped Taurus, which went on sale in September, feels smaller inside than its predecessor although Ford engineers insist that the vehicle has slightly more room.
Ford officials have scrambled in the last two months to come up with the Taurus G, which will be available only in white, red, gray, silver and green for the exterior, while all of the interiors will be gray, the most popular color. The mirrors and side moldings will be black only, instead of matching the paint color as they do in other Taurus models.
Some popular options will not be offered on the Taurus G, as a way to limit the number of buyers who choose the less expensive vehicle. Standard equipment will include an AM-FM stereo radio, air-conditioning, dual air bags and a 3.0 liter V-6 engine with automatic transmission.
Robert Rewey, Ford's group vice president for marketing and sales, predicted that the G version will account for only 5 to 10 percent of all Taurus cars sold. He said that the company had not overpriced the original vehicle but that public reaction had produced considerable concern among Ford dealers.
"We're responding to a lot of coverage in the press and elsewhere about where the Taurus is positioned," he said in an interview today. Ford's overall pricing strategy remains in place, he said, adding that the decision to offer the Taurus G and the decision last month to offer discounts on half of Ford's product line represented isolated responses to market needs.
The daily rate of Taurus sales fell by 3.5 percent in January from the previous year, still a better showing than that of many other Ford models. But Christopher W. Cedergren, a consultant at AutoPacific Group, in Santa Ana, Calif., said the Taurus sales were unimpressive in light of the incentives being offered.
"Given the $600 rebate, they probably should have done more," he said.
Mr. Rewey said that small-car sales were the weakest last month, while the F-150 pickup truck, the Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle and the Ford Contour sedan all sold well, as did the large Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars.
Ford dealers today played down the importance of the weak sales. January sales were "maybe a little softer than we normally have," said Larry V. Sexton, a dealer in St. Roberts, Mo. "It's not like the bottom fell out."

HEADLINE: Beijing's Public Relations Gambit Won't Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"China, Vying With Taiwan, Explores Public Relations" (front page, Feb. 2) states that Taiwan's Government, which has lobbied Capitol Hill for decades, "is paying $4.5 million over three years to the Washington lobbying firm of Cassidy & Associates." Cassidy & Associates is employed not by Taiwan's Government but by the Taipei-based Taiwan Research Institute. 
 A private, nonprofit study group, the Taiwan Research Institute is headed by Liu Tai-ying, an economist and former classmate of Taiwan's president who also happens to be the chairman of the business management committee of Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang.
The three-year contract with Cassidy & Associates, which was signed in 1994 to advance American "appreciation of Taiwan's history, culture and democratic development," is but one example of how vast sums are spent to have Taiwan's voice heard.

A Stock-Trading Seat Is More And A Gold-Trading Seat Less These Days

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
STANDING on the New York Stock Exchange floor costs more than ever before. But trading gold costs a lot less than it used to.
The Big Board reported yesterday that a seat sold for $1.25 million, up an amazing $200,000 from the most recent sale, recorded on Dec. 4, 1995, and $100,000 over the old record high, of $1.15 million, which was set on Sept. 21, 1987, less than a month before prices crashed. 
 The word "seat" is something of a misnomer; traders do a lot more running around and yelling than they do sitting, and in fact many of the 1,366 members lack a place to sit.
The price of a Big Board seat is up from a post-crash low, reached Nov. 27, 1990, of $250,000. The prices reflect the money that people think can be made trading stocks on the exchange, which in turn depends on an appraisal of the popularity of investing in stocks and on the New York Stock Exchange's competitive position with other stock markets.
Currently, both look good. Big Board volume is up sharply over the last couple of years, and the public interest in equity investing, both directly and through mutual funds, is also high. Those factors are related to share prices, but not completely, and as a result seat prices can be far more volatile than stock prices. The Dow Jones industrial average is more than three times as high as its post-crash low; the trading value of a Big Board seat has quintupled.
By contrast, investing in precious metals seems much less attractive, either to individual investors or to professionals. In 1984, a seat on the Commodity Exchange of New York -- the pre-eminent market for futures on precious metals -- sold for $200,000. Yesterday, such a seat (now on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange) traded for $115,000.
That price is down from a 1995 high of $149,000, indicating that despite the fact that gold prices have come alive in recent weeks, with gold leaping more than $20 an ounce, there is still no confidence that trading will rise enough to help profits of the brokers who execute public orders.
At other commodity exchanges, the picture is not quite as glum, in large part because many exchanges trade financial futures, which have done well. But the Chicago Board of Trade reports its last sale of a seat was for $625,000 last week, a price that is 12 percent below the peak of $710,000, reached just over a year ago. And at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the last sale was for $585,000, down 37 percent from a peak of $925,000, set in August 1994.
The interest right now, among those who want to trade and among those who want to collect commissions by executing those trades, is clearly in stocks. The number of seats on the Big Board has been fixed at the same 1,366 since 1953, and seats do not trade that often. Last year, total volume came to 11 seats. But it is unusual for prices to move by huge amounts, particularly in the absence of such major events as crashes or new laws that seem to radically change the outlook for stock trading.
Even in the heated market of 1987, when the stock market seemed headed for the moon, until it crashed, the largest single increase from one trade to the next was $150,000, another record that was broken yesterday.
Still, the ascent of seat prices over time is not quite as rapid as in 1987. When the 1987 peak was set, the price was up 132 percent over the last 12 months, with a seat having sold for $480,000 on Sept. 22, 1986.
A year ago, the most recent sale had been at $750,000. The increase since then is 67 percent, a lot more than share prices have risen but perhaps an indication that the seat market is not quite as overheated as it was in 1987.
Seat prices can come down quickly. On Oct. 15, 1987, the Thursday before Black Monday, a seat traded at $1,025,000. On Oct. 26, less than two weeks later, a seat sold for $625,000, a drop of 39 percent. And the price was destined to go lower until it bottomed amid widespread pessimism during the 1990 recession.
And now, everything looks lovely to those who want to trade on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: On Eve of Talks, Iraq Is Hopeful U.N. Will Let Oil Exports Resume

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Feb. 5

 BODY:
As Iraq and the United Nations prepare for talks that could allow the Baghdad Government to resume exports of oil, optimism has surged in the Iraqi capital, where the dinar is now seven times stronger against the dollar than it was at the start of the year.
But for the American military planners and others responsible for maintaining a cordon around Iraq, the prospect that Iraqi oil could begin flowing again through the Persian Gulf is seen as a new challenge. 
 With talks to begin in New York on Tuesday, it is not clear that the two sides can reach agreement on the United Nations plan, which would allow Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months, but only under conditions that Baghdad has previously rejected.
Yet Iraq has already announced that its oil terminals at the head of the gulf are ready to receive tankers. And commanders of the American-led flotilla offshore have had to begin planning for a possible easing of the United Nations sanctions -- a step that the official Iraqi press has heralded as "the beginning of the end for the embargo" that was imposed five-and-a-half years ago.
The Security Council imposed the sanctions after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and has stipulated that they will not be lifted until Iraq accounts for all its weapons of mass destruction and the United Nations can certify that they have been destroyed.
In recent weeks, the main preoccupation of the American vessels has been efforts by small dhows to smuggle out prized Iraqi dates. If Iraq is allowed to turn on its oil spigots, even under strict limits, enforcing the sanctions will become far more complicated.
In an unusual step, Vice Adm. Scott Redd, commander of the United States Fifth Fleet, briefed United Nations officials last week about the American-led operation in the gulf, which since 1990 has intercepted some 22,000 vessels in its mission to halt seaborne trade to and from Iraq.
Under Security Council Resolution 986, which would allow Iraq to sell a limited quantity of oil and use the proceeds to buy food and other goods for its civilian population, exports must be carried out under United Nations supervision.
But the form the supervision will take has not been worked out. While the resolution says Iraq is obliged to export the "larger share" through a pipeline to Turkey, Baghdad has expressed reluctance in part because the route passes through Kurdish-controlled areas of northern Iraq.
Iraq is demanding that it send much of the flow through the gulf from its ports at Mina al Bakr and Khor al Amaya. Oil traders and diplomats say that arrangement would be more difficult to monitor.
"I certainly wouldn't say that it's going to be easy," an American official in the gulf said of the Navy's likely involvement in policing oil exports.
Iraq, which has not been permitted to sell oil abroad except for limited sales to neighboring Jordan, is plainly eager to regain its place as one of the world's leading oil merchants. With a new confidence that has fueled the spectacular rise in its currency, Baghdad seems to think that it might at last be back on that track.
Diplomats and journalists in Baghdad have reported that the increased strength of the dinar means that essential items like sugar, rice, eggs and flour now cost at least 75 percent less than they did three weeks ago.
They have also reported a buying spree by residents suddenly able to afford dollar-denominated luxury goods, along with a rush to exchange hoarded American dollars at favorable rates. The dinar, valued at 3,000 to the dollar at the New Year, is now trading at 450 to the dollar.
On Sunday, after President Saddam Hussein met with his economic advisers, the Government issued astatement saying, "We expect positive results from the dialogue with the United Nations."
For nearly a year, Iraq has rejected the plan, and diplomats and officials at the United Nations remain skeptical that it is ready to accept their terms. Even in sending its negotiator, Abdulamir al-Anbari, for the talks in New York with Tono Eitel of Germany, who heads the United Nations sanctions committee, Baghdad has refused to refer to Resolution 986 by name.
Baghdad regards as one of the most nettlesome provisions the United Nations' insistence that some oil revenue be used to distribute food to rebel Kurds in the north and to Shiite dissidents in south. In a statement today, the Arab League made clear that it shared that concern "about the sovereignty, safety and sanctity of Iraq's soil."
The organization urged the United Nations and Iraq "to reach a compromise" that would allow the limited oil sales to begin. That sentiment has found support well beyond the Middle East among Western governments troubled by the toll the sanctions have exacted on the Iraqi population, one-fifth of whom may now be malnourished, according to a recent United Nations report.
But American officials led by Madeleine K. Albright, the chief delegate to the United Nations, have said there will be no negotiations about the resolution itself. 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 9, 1996, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about negotiations to let Iraq resume limited oil sales misstated the year of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. It was 1990, not 1989.
The article also misidentified the chief United Nations negotiator in the talks with the Iraqis. He is Under Secretary General Hans Corell; Tono Eitel is head of the Security Council sanctions committee.

HEADLINE: We Can't Afford Voodoo 2

BYLINE: By Herbert Stein; Herbert Stein, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, was chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The experienced Republican Presidential candidates are amazed at the surge of Steve Forbes. They shouldn't be. They prepared the way for Steve Forbes. Indeed, they made him inevitable. 
 At least since the time of Andrew Mellon, the idea that taxes are evil has been forefront in the Republican creed. Ronald Reagan refined the creed: Taxes are not only evil; they are also unnecessary. In the post-World War II era, the party's platform has had two main planks -- anti-Communism and anti-taxes. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the platform is down to one plank.
Of course, responsible Republican officials could not live by their own ideology. Once in Washington, they had to recognize that taxation is a legitimate and necessary function of government. So, President Dwight Eisenhower found himself repeatedly resisting calls for tax reduction. In 1969 President Richard Nixon resisted a drive for a big tax cut led by Senator Albert Gore Sr., a Democrat and father of the current Vice President.
President George "Read My Lips" Bush agreed to a tax increase in 1990. Bob Dole, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, took the lead in raising taxes in 1982. And every other veteran Republican Senator has agreed to a tax increase or resisted a cut.
This is now a problem for Republican candidates who have held office. They want to show their adherence to the Republican anti-tax creed. But their own records, and their appreciation of the realities of the budget, keep them for doing so unreservedly. So the way is clear for a candidate uncontaminated by prior contact with the Federal budget, who can sing that old sweet song, "Let Me Cut Your Taxes, I Just Love Your Vote." That gives us Steve Forbes and the flat tax.
Of course, the term "flat tax" is a diversion. What it means is "low tax." No one is trudging through New Hampshire trying to sell a 25 percent flat tax. It has to be a 17 percent flat tax or some other impossibly low number because the flat tax is terribly unflat in its impact on different people, depending on whether they have home mortgages or employer-provided health benefits, and so forth
To be attractive, the flat tax has to be low enough so that even those most disadvantaged by it get something. Such a low rate would lose a lot of revenue, but that doesn't bother Mr. Forbes, because he hasn't yet encountered the Federal budget. That is presumably what he means when he boasts of not being a Washington insider.
 Thus cutting taxes serves all purposes in the Forbes campaign. You want 4 percent economic growth? Cut taxes! You want 4 1/2 percent interest rates? Cut taxes!
You want foreign policy? Cutting taxes will make America such a model society that the Serbs, Croats and Bosnians will stop shooting one another and emulate us. You want anti-crime policy? Cut taxes on legal income and you will eliminate the incentive to engage in illegal activity. You want fewer single mothers? Eliminate the tax code's marriage penalty.
The "insider" candidates find it hard to deal with this. They can't say that the Forbes tax rate is much too low. There is no such thing in the Republican campaign lexicon -- or in the Democratic one either -- as a tax rate that is too low.
The political mythology that cutting taxes is the sure road to electoral success is an indication of how few politicians know history. After the Republican 80th Congress cut taxes in 1948, Harry Truman won an election that he wasn't supposed to win. After the Republican 83rd Congress cut taxes in 1954, Democrats took control of the House for 40 years.
Yes, there was one politically successful tax cutter: Ronald Reagan. Mr. Forbes's friends like to compare him to Mr. Reagan. But there are critical differences. For one thing, Mr. Reagan had spontaneous charm. Also, Mr. Reagan had two big issues on which to base his 1980 campaign -- Communism and inflation -- and he later deal with both successfully. And he even went on to raise taxes by his second year in office.
The country faces an entirely different fiscal situation today than in 1980. Then the Federal debt was 26.8 percent of the gross domestic product, only slightly above its postwar low. The ratio today is more than 50 percent, and without a radical change it will likely exceed 100 percent in the next generation. We could afford Ronald Reagan once. We cannot afford him again.
Meanwhile, I'm cool. As far as I can figure it out, the Forbes flat tax would save me a lot money.

HEADLINE: Celebrating Four Who Shaped American Tastes in Food

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT 

 BODY:
A SERIES of celebrations honoring individuals and establishments that have shaped the way Americans cook and eat is taking place this month in New York.
Tonight, a 12-course salute will be given at An American Place for Fannie Merritt Farmer, whose "Original Boston Cooking School Cookbook" was first published 100 years ago. The dinner, a daunting example of eating at the turn of this century, will be based on a typical "full course dinner" of those days. An abbreviated version, a mere six courses, will be available to the public tomorrow and Friday evenings. 
 On Feb. 23, a seven-course bicentennial dinner will be held at the James Beard Foundation based on recipes from "American Cookery," published in Hartford in 1796 by Amelia Simmons, said to be the first cookbook written and published by an American. And several Amelia Simmons dishes will be served at the restaurant Home through the end of the month.
Last Monday, a 10-course fish dinner was given to mark the 10th anniversary of both the Beard Foundation and Le Bernardin, the restaurant transplanted to New York from Paris by Gilbert Le Coze and his sister, Maguy. The complete dinner, which alternated dishes by Mr. Le Coze with more recent creations by Eric Ripert, the executive chef, can be ordered at Le Bernardin throughout the month.
These influential experts represented vastly different points on the evolving time line of American cuisine. But Amelia Simmons, Fannie Farmer, James Beard and Gilbert Le Coze all shared a passionate advocacy of the ingredients produced in the United States, insisting on only the freshest and best.
Mr. Le Coze died in 1994, but his approach to cooking fish continues to have a profound influence on American chefs. Though a native of France, he made a point of serving fish like halibut, pompano, black bass, monkfish and grouper from American waters, not the imported Dover sole his peers in top-flight restaurants tended to prefer. He went to the fish market at 2 A.M. himself, bought only what was sublimely fresh and prepared it with great delicacy, slightly undercooking it to create a silky richness.
"It's like a school, like painting," Mr. Ripert said. Because Mr. Le Coze never wrote a cookbook, his impact was far greater in restaurants than in homes.
Mr. Beard not only counseled chefs but was also an invaluable guide for cooks at home. And now the foundation that bears his name, through its dinners and awards, is helping today's professionals and keeping his legacy alive. In 1972, when Mr. Beard wrote "American Cookery," he understood that the cuisine of this country depended on "the products of the soil and native traditions," and also on "the gradual integration of many ethnic forms."
Miss Farmer's target was the housewife, not the chef. She is remembered, for better or worse, as the person responsible for introducing standardized measuring cups and spoons to American kitchens.
Nonetheless, there is more to Fannie Farmer than the soulless home economist with a scientific approach to cooking.
"I have trouble believing she was devoid of passion," said Japser White, the Boston-based chef, who owns eight editions of Fannie Farmer cookbooks and was instrumental in organizing tonight's din'er at An American Place. "She placed real focus on seasonality and taste." For the centennial, a new facsimile edition of the cookbook that was a bible for generations of Americans, and that was revised over time, has been published by Hugh Lauter Levin Associates.
She certainly insisted on fresh, local ingredients. "Summer vegetables should be cooked as soon after gathering as possible," she wrote. Unfortunately, she was largely ignored when she suggepted cooking lamb chops rare.
As for Miss Farmer's precursor, Amelia Simmons, it is possible to go back another 100 years and still find advice that resonates.
She recommended sending roast lamb to the table with "a nice salad, green beans, fresh peas or a cauliflower or asparagus." She wrote about blackfish, a type of fish caught in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New England, which is becoming popular again.
She also had the luxury of seven kinds of fresh peas and five of cabbage, more than are in American markets today. She was notable, too, as the first to publish recipes for some thoroughly American specialties like cole slaw, pumpkin pie and soft gingerbread, and to include recipes like Johnnycakes thap call for corn meal or "Indian meal," as it was known.
Barbara Shinn, the co-owner of Home restaurant in Greenwich Village, said Miss Simmons validated native American ingredients for her contemporaries. David Page, Ms. Shinn's partner and the chef, is interpreting Miss Simmons's recipes for dishes like shad roe, potted duck, stuffed veal leg and Indian pudding in their restaurant and at the James Beard Foundation.
Tonight's Fannie Farmer dinner will closely follow her recipes, Mr. White said, including oysters on the half-shell with Boston brown bread, oxtail consomme, puff-pastry turnovers filled with veal and cepes, halibut "sandwiches" with a stuffing of minced halibut, roast venison loin, a "cutlet" of lobster and chanterelles, a vegetable course, quail with salad, ginger sherbet, passion fruit and pineapple jelly, chocolate charlotte, cheese and nuts.
"The menu was designed to show the depth of what Fannie Farmer offered," Mr. White said. For Larry Forgione, the chef at An American Place, the best part of getting the dinner ready has been discovering how up-to-date many of Miss Farmer's recipes were. The lobster cutlet, for example, is not unlike a dish that David Burke concocted for Park Avenue Cafe.
At Monday's dinner at Le Bernardin, the mood was congratulatory and festive. But the focus was on the food, beginning with Mr. Le Coze's now-famous slivers of raw black bass with basil and coriander leaves.
This dish was followed by slices of rare tuna crusted with pepper, oysters anointed with truffled cream, poached lobster in a spicy bouillon, buttery baked sea urchins and Mr. Ripert's sublime sea scallops and foie gras wrapped in cabbage. Then came another Le Coze specialty, which was probably the star of the show, halibut simply poached and bathed in a warm, herb-flecked vinaigrette. Crispy red snapper with cepes in a rich port sauce followed. Like the main courses, the desserts, a plate of caramel variations and a delicate chocolate napoleon, were served in modest portions.
The 86 guests cleaned their plates. It was a deliciously defining moment for the restaurant that changed the American attitude toward fish.

HEADLINE: Borden Putnam, 73, Commissioner of Commerce

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Borden R. Putnam, New Jersey's first Commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development and a pivotal figure in the state's economic growth during the 1980's, died on Monday at his home in Franklin Lakes, N.J. He was 73.
The cause of death was complications of Parkinson's disease and recent surgery, according to his son, Borden Putnam 3d of Half Moon Bay, Calif. 
 From 1982 to 1990, in the administration of Gov. Thomas H. Kean, Mr. Putnam played a major role in shifting New Jersey's economic base from manufacturing to services and high technology.
"He presided over the largest growth in the state's history -- three quarters of a million jobs from the time I was sworn in as Governor till the time I left," said Mr. Kean, who is now the president of Drew University in Madison, N.J. "A lot of the corporations who came told me afterward that the kinds of efforts Borden Putnam made were directly responsible for their decision to locate in New Jersey. In other words, there are a number of people who have jobs today in New Jersey who really owe their thanks to Borden Putnam."
Guiding initiatives sponsored by his department, Mr. Putnam was instrumental in forming the New Jersey Commission on Science and Technology. He served as chairman of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, the Corporation for Business Assistance, the Urban Enterprise Zone Authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Development Advisory Committee and the Governor's Advisory Council on Minority Business Development.
In an interview in 1989, a year before his retirement, Mr. Putnam said he was hard pressed to enumerate the principal accomplishments of his office, but he pointed to three: "The development of our urban centers, our tourism commercials and our efforts in promoting international trade."
He said: "I start with our urban centers, because it is here that we have developed financial programs to help minorities find jobs and enjoy the benefits that go with employment. Remember, it's financial programs that move the world."
He added that the "New Jersey and You, Perfect Together" travel and tourism campaign had brought business into the state. "Although the ads are aimed at promoting tourism, they are seen by business people looking for a place to locate a plant or an office who start to think New Jersey might be a good place to make a capital investment," Mr. Putnam said.
With regard to international trade, he pointed out that New Jersey was 10th in the nation in gross dollars earned in international trade and seventh in the foreign investment it was attracting. He noted that the state had opened an office in Tokyo and was considering opening others. New Jersey now has offices in London and Israel.
Mr. Putnam came to state administration from two of New Jersey's major industries, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. A chemical engineer by education, he worked for the American Cyanamid Company of Wayne, N.J., for 35 years and was a senior vice president and member of the board when he retired in 1982 to join the Kean administration.
Mr. Putnam began his career with Cyanamid in 1947 as a chemical engineer, and served in various managerial posts with Cyanamid until 1965, when he was appointed assistant general manager of its Lederle Laboratories Division. He became general manager in 1968 and a vice president in 1971.
After his retirement from state administration, Mr. Putnam served on the boards of Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J., Montclair State College, the Silicon Technology Corporation of Oakland, N.J., and the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark.
Mr. Putnam, who was born in Washington, grew up in the Jackson Heights section of Queens and graduated in 1943 from Princeton, where he received a bachelor of science degree and a master's degree in chemical engineering.
During World War II, he was a Navy lieutenant (junior grade) in the Pacific.
Mr. Putnam's wife of 43 years, the former Jean Mason Woodside, died on Jan. 23. Besides his son, Mr. Putnam is survived by two daughters, Ashley Putnam of Piedmont, Calif., and Andrea Orchard of Middletown, N.J.; a sister, Mary Follette of Metuchen, N.J., his stepmother, Frances Wisenant Putnam of Plymouth, N.H., and seven grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Eating Well;
A New Goal Beyond Organic: 'Clean Food'

BYLINE: By Marian Burros 

 BODY:
A GROWING number of Americans are taking their health and well-being into their own hands, in part because they have lost faith in the institutions that are supposed to improve their lives.
Upper-middle-class and middle-class baby boomers who are facing their mortality, along with younger people who have grown up with a concern for the environment, are turning to food, dietary supplements and alternative medical treatments to enhance the quality and length of their lives. One of the most obvious manifestations of the movement is what Gerald Celente has christ'ned the "clean-food diet." 
 In the winter issue of The Trends Journal, Mr. Celente, the director of the Trends Research Institute in Rhinebeck, N.Y., describes the clean-food diet as something beyond organic -- "a new standard for health and reliability." The keys are "foods free of artificial preservatives, coloring, irradiation, synthetic pesticides, fungicides, ripening agents, fumigants, drug residues and growth hormones" and those that are "processed, packaged, transported and stored to retain maximum nutritional value."
Other trend watchers agree. Peter Stisser, a vice president of Roper Starch Worldwide, a marketing research company in Manhattan, says that one of the growing fears that may be driving the clean-food movement is biotechnology. "There is a backlash against technology, against bioengineering, a fear that technology will worsen people's lives," he said.
Although there is evidence that many people still view food as an indulgence, there is also ample data to support the contention that the clean-food movement is growing:
* Sales of organic produce nearly doubled in five years, from $3.9 billion in 1989 to $7.6 billion in 1994.
* Sales of bottled water have nearly tripled since 1984, from 933 million gallons that year to a preliminary figure of 2.87 billion last year.
* Sales of milk from organically fed cows are rising. For example, Horizon Organic Dairy, based in Boulder, Colo., opened in 1992, selling milk from about 300 such cows. Today, the company sells milk from 10,000 cows, and its sales reached $7 million last year, compared with $1 million in 1993.
* In 1991, there were 195 health-food supermarkets across the country, defined as containing more than 5,000 square feet; by the end of 1994, there were 650. Five years ago, there was not a single health-food supermarket in the Washington, D.C., area; today there are nine.
* Last year, a third of Americans made use of alternative medical treatments, spending $14 billion of their own money to do so.
* Sales of dietary supplements in grocery stores, drug stores and mass marketers like Wal-Mart rose 11 percent in each of the last two years.
Clean food is also becoming the new standard for quality. Although there is no nationwide definition for organic, the term generally refers to vegetables, grains and fruit that are free of chemical pesticides, herbicides, fungicides and fertilizers and to meat and products from animals that are raised without hormones or antibiotics.
Organic, once symbolized by a shriveled-up piece of fruit in a funky health-food store where customers bagged their own groceries, now stands for the highest-quality, freshest and best-tasting food. But clean food goes beyond organic, to include food and drink that is as pure as possible: water without harmful bacteria, chickens that are raised without antibiotics and that range freely on the farm, and fruits and vegetables not only grown without insecticides and pesticides but also picked and eaten at the peak of freshness and flavor when the nutrients are at their best.
Linda Walrafen, 57, of Washington, prefers the new health-food supermarkets like Fresh Fields to conventional supermarkets. "It's the quality I'm looking for," she said. "I like nice things, and it makes my cooking taste better."
For Clark Wolf, a food consultant in Manhattan, clean food means quality, in part because those who sell clean food have become more sophisticated marketers.
"Five years ago, health food came to the Fancy Food Show looking like hospital supplies and cleaning fluid and failed miserably," Mr. Wolf said. "Now, it has come back packaged as specialty food. It is pure and delicious food, not health food."
Distrust in the Government's ability to keep the food supply safe, the water pure and the air clean is growing. Despite Congressional efforts to weaken environmental laws, Mr. Celente said, "there's no mandate to reduce environmental regulations." Polls consistently show that most Americans support environmental laws. In a nationwide telephone poll of 1,000 adults conducted by the Wirthlin Group last summer, 72 percent of the respondents said the environment should be protected regardless of cost.
Increasingly, people are assuming more responsibility for protecting themselves from hazards. "The 80's were about control; the 90's are about self-reliance," said Mr. Stisser, the Roper research executive. "There is a growing number of people who see food not just as an indulgence, but as a way to protect against the future."
Today, perhaps 3 percent of the population is engaged in this effort, Mr. Celente said. In the next 20 years, he predicts, the figure will be about 30 percent.
Clean food is what some of the leading chefs across the country -- like Alice Waters at Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., and David Bouley of Bouley in Manhattan -- have been talking about for years, though that is not what they called it.
"Part of it has to do with health," said Ms. Waters, the first American chef to stress the importance of locally grown, organic food for its taste and its environmental soundness. "It's also a connection with the kind of food that is alive, fresh, seasonal and a connection with the people who are growing it. A deep and lasting sensual connection is made, and once you eat food like that, you can't turn back. Just the growth of farmers' markets is an indication of what is happening. There must be 50 or 60 in the Bay area."
This search for quality and health is generally a function of affluence. There are enough middle-class people, as well upper-middle-class people, to sustain and broaden it, says John Naisbitt, the author of "Megatrends 2000" (William Morrow & Company, 1990) and "Megatrends Asia," published last month by Simon & Schuster. A similar phenomenon, he said, is occurring in Asia.
Even though organic food costs less than it did a few years ago, it is still sometimes more expensive than conventional food. More people will buy organic food, Mr. Stisser said, when it is price-competitive. An increasing number of people are already willing to pay the difference.
Lynn Perlik, 40, a massage-therapy student from suburban Maryland who was recently shopping at the Fresh Fields in Washington, said she supported organically grown food because it was better for the environment. But she added: "I wish it could be within everyone's reach. The prices are kind of high and limit how much I can buy."
Jane Wiznia, 37, a clinical social worker who lives in Bedford, N.Y., said she was willing to pay a premium for more healthful, safer food. "More and more research points to the fact that nutrition and the environment play a role in disease and health," she added. She and her husband, Andrew, a pediatric immunologist, have a 14-month-old daughter and are "concerned about the environment and what we are going to leave for our kids," she said, adding: "I don't want irradiated strawberries, bioengineered food, milk with bovine growth hormones. Thank God I have the option."
Ms. Wiznia is among the 3 percent of the population that does 90 percent of its shopping in health-food stores, said Chris Hitt, the president of the natural-food supermarket chain Bread and Circus, a subsidiary of Whole Foods Market Inc. Another 10 percent buys a quarter to half of its food in these stores.
Whole Foods Market, based in Austin, Tex., is the largest health-food supermarket chain in the country, with 44 stores. "Our niche is growing 10 percent a year," Mr. Hitt said.
Six weeks ago, Lifethyme, a natural-foods supermarket, opened in Greenwich Village, at 408-410 Sixth Avenue, near Eighth Street, in a seemingly unlikely spot -- near Balducci's and Jefferson Market, two of Manhattan's best markets. But Paul Kralyevich, the owner of the new store, says business is better than expected.
"Balducci's does Italian very well," he said. "We do natural and organic very well. The products we sell they don't. People are scared of what's in their food, especially if they have kids." The store also sells household products that are supposed to be better for the environment, like recycled paper towels.
Natural-food supermarkets have been a long time in coming to New York because of high rents here. But smaller stores are opening. Fresh Fields, which has two stores nearby in New Jersey and one in Greenwich, Conn., is looking for locations in Manhattan, as is Bread and Circus.
Traditional supermarkets have heard the message. Karen Brown, the senior vice president of communications for the Food Marketing Institute in Washington, says the landscape is very different today than it was just a few years ago. 'Before, traditional supermarkets didn't feel they had to stock organic foods or make them visible, but new competition has shown it's needed," she said.
Barry Sher, the vice president of public affairs at Giant Food, a 165-store supermarket chain in the Baltimore-Washington area, said the chain tried organics six years ago but "they flopped miserably, in part because the price differential was so great." Today, the increasing affordability of organic food, and the concern for health, have had a big effect on what the company sells. A hundred Giant Food stores carry a line of organically prepared foods, and 12 of them also carry organic produce. "People write to us all the time saying they want healthier food and pesticide-free food," Mr. Sher said.
Mr. Celente said the people who are driving the clean-food movement would "perceive a genuine interconnectivity between land, water, air and life" in the next century. And, he added, they will "conclude they are not simply on the earth, but of the earth" -- a coming of age for the 1960's hippies.
Not everyone is joining in.
Other trends also point to more people who see food only as an indulgence. Steakhouses, with 24-ounce porterhouses, are also on the rise.

HEADLINE: THE NEEDEST CASES;
Donors Taking Up Government's Slack

BYLINE: By SARAH JAY 

 BODY:
Some people have had to reduce their annual gifts to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund this year, but others have gone in the opposite direction, intent on being more generous as the government becomes less so.
Berenice K. Cohen of Mount Vernon, N.Y., wrote, "As our Mayor and Governor try to cut all programs for the needy, I, as a middle-class benefactor of their programs, feel it is necessary to double our usual contribution to the fund this year as a way of compensating for the unfair budgets proposed for next year." 
 Mrs. Cohen, a retired New York City social studies teacher, gave $400 this year, money she earned by selling some of the pottery she makes. Along with her husband, Robert, who taught shop in New York City schools, Mrs. Cohen has been a regular contributor for several years.
"We feel fairly lucky and financially comfortable," she said in a telephone interview. "We have decent pension arrangements. The younger generation hasn't been as lucky."
Mrs. Cohen, who volunteers to help the homeless, said she is troubled greatly by the way the poor seem to be targeted by the politicians and by the way the middle class has been affected by the sluggish economy.
"So many of them are hurting," she said.
For the same reason, Helene Schoenfeld of Manhattan doubled her donation to $50 this year, as did Elizabeth Tom, also of Manhattan.
"I see a lot of poverty and people in need around me," Ms. Tom wrote in a note accompanying her $100 gift. "I feel there is a great need to help those who are down on their luck and lack the resources to help themselves," she said.
Since 1912, The Neediest Cases Fund has not only provided the poor with the basics, like food, clothing and medicine, but has also assisted middle-class families who may need one-time help with a utility check. The annual campaign to raise money for the fund ends on Feb. 29. Since The Times pays administrative costs, all donations go directly to the seven charities supported by the fund.
Some people, like Nancy P. Nemlich of White Plains, will snatch at any excuse to double their donations. "I am increasing my contribution this year from $50 to $60," she wrote, "and adding another $40, which represents a check from my cleaners for a ruined garment."
Others need no excuse at all.
"Every year I like to try and 'beat' what I gave the previous year," wrote Jody Saunders of Valley Cottage, N.Y. "For 1995, I'm fortunate to be able to do so, and am privileged to help my neighbors in the best city in the world, N.Y.C.!"

HEADLINE: Fed Survey Shows Banks Are Tightening Up on Loans

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Big banks are making it tougher for businesses and consumers to get loans, the Federal Reserve said today, at least partly because they fear a weakening economy will make it less likely that they will be repaid.
The Fed's survey of 59 American banks and 23 branches of foreign-owned banks suggested that lenders were less willing and borrowers less eager for loans than was the case late last year. 
 It fit with other signs of slowing in national economic activity as 1995 closed that has made consumers less willing to spend and more concerned about job security.
The bleaker outlook may be giving bankers the jitters about the creditworthiness of their customers.
"The survey results are consistent with a slight firming of credit standards over the past three months," said the periodic report from senior lending officers. The last report was issued on Nov. 21.
Bankers said lending standards for commercial and industrial companies of all sizes had been made more strict in the last three months, as have standards for real estate loans.
"This is the first survey to report a net tightening of standards on business loans in the past three years," the bankers said.
Though there was no reported change in standards for making home mortgage loans, about one-third of the bankers said there has been a slowdown recently in the growth of real estate loans on banks' books.
That was because bankers were packaging more loans into marketable securities as more people switched to fixed-rate mortgages and there were fewer new loans in many regions where the housing market was weakening.
Demand for loans was mixed.
The survey found little change from November in the numbers of large and midsized companies seeking to borrow, but small-business loan demand was up.
"Demand for consumer installment loans weakened, however," the bankers said in the survey. About one-quarter of banks raised their standards to qualify for new credit card accounts or to get a loan to buy a new car.
Banks attributed the tightening to "increased delinquency rates, increased household debt burdens, an increased willingness of households to declare bankruptcy and a less favorable economic outlook," the survey said.
The survey of senior lending officers was closely watched during the 1990-91 recession and in the period just after it ended because of concern that lack of credit was hampering the ability of business to borrow and expand.
In the latest survey, the bankers noted that notwithstanding an overall firming of standards for business loans, at least some lenders were making it easier for corporations to qualify.

Gold Is Lower Again on Signs High Price Is Curbing Demand

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Gold prices fell yesterday for a second consecutive session on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange on signs that six-year-high prices had begun to curb demand from retail buyers and jewelers.
"With gold inching toward $420 an ounce, we see people hesitating," said Murray Kirsch, a vice president of Ross Refiner Inc. in New York, which sells gold to jewelers and other retailers. "Consumers are comfortable with gold in the $390-to-$410-an-ounce range." 
 On other commodity markets, crude oil and wheat prices rose. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 17 commodities gained 0.77 point, to 246.61.
Gold for April delivery fell $1.30, to $414.60 an ounce in New York. Gold prices reached $420.20 an ounce on Friday, their highest since August 1990. Other precious metals also fell. The March silver contract fell 3.8 cents, to $5.777 an ounce, while April platinum dropped $2, to $431 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Traders expect demand for gold in Asia to slip even faster than demand in the United States. It was the surging demand for gold from India, China and Taiwan that drove gold consumption to a record 3,550 metric tons in 1995, outstripping supply by almost 700 tons.
"The Asian economies react much more quickly to price changes in gold," said Jim Steel, analyst at Refco Inc. in New York. "You can see the ups and downs clearly on a month-to-month basis."
Crude oil prices rose as Iraq and the United Nations began talks on a plan to allow Iraq to sell as much as $2 billion of oil every six months to pay for food and medicine.
Crude oil for March delivery rose 15 cents, to $17.69 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
An Iraqi negotiator said he expected a first round of talks to last up to 10 days, to be followed by another round of meetings.
Most traders said they expected prices to hover between $17 and $18 a barrel while the talks went on.
"The Iraq thing is hanging over us now," said Ed Kevelson, a broker at Paribas Futures Inc. in New York. "The market might sit a bit and wait for some news."
Wheat prices jumped after reports that too little rain and severe cold left the winter wheat crop in poor condition.

HEADLINE: Weekly Earnings Off Slightly in December

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Average weekly earnings of United States workers, after adjusting for inflation and seasonal factors, fell two-tenths of 1 percent in December after declining a revised seven-tenths of a percent in November, the Labor Department said today.
The department previously reported that real average weekly earnings fell four-tenths of 1 percent in November. 
 The December figures stem from a drop of three-tenths of 1 percent in average weekly hours, an increase of three-tenths of a percent in average hourly earnings and an identical increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers.
Real average weekly earnings in December were four-tenths of 1 percent above their level of December 1994, the department said. In constant 1982 dollars, weekly earnings for nonsupervisory private workers outside the farm sector averaged a seasonally adjusted $255.49 in December, compared with $256.01 in November and $256.94 in December 1994.

Prices Rise As Auction Is Success

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday as the Government's quarterly refunding began with a successful auction of Treasury notes.
The 30-year bond rose 13/32, to a price of 110 6/32 to yield 6.12 percent, down from 6.15 percent on Monday. 
 The Government sold $18.5 billion in three-year notes with an average yield of 5.043 percent, but analysts said yesterday's auction was the easy part of the refunding. The remaining $26 billion of securities is expected to be harder to sell, with $14 billion of 10-year notes scheduled today and $12 billion of 30-year bonds set for Thursday.
"The remaining two are usually harder auctions to complete successfully," said Gerald A. Guild, senior vice president of the taxable fixed-income department at Advest Inc. "But we still won't know if this refunding is successful; that will depend on whether the price of these securities at settlement on Feb. 15 will be at or above the average price at auction."
Mr. Guild said investors were worried about the heavy supply. There is a chance, he said, that the yield on today's 10-year note could be below the 25-year low of 5.69 reached in November 1993, and the 30-year bond below the more-than-20-year low of 6.33 percent in August 1993.
"The economic fundamentals, low inflation and the slowdown in economic growth are positives," Mr. Guild said, "while the big negative remains the impasse between Congress and the President on budget and debt ceiling. I personally do not believe the market will do well until the issues are resolved, which may not be until after the election. As a result short rates likely will decline more than long rates."
Traders said investors bid strongly for the three-year notes because they believed that the Federal Reserve would continue to lower interest rates to help the economy. The average yield on the three-year notes was down from 5.549 percent in November and the lowest since 4.83 percent on Feb. 8, 1994.
In when-issued trading, the 10-year notes in today's auction were being offered at a price to yield 5.65 percent, and Thursday's 30-year bond, 6.06 percent.
Last week the Fed lowered short-term rates for the third time in eight months, cutting the Federal funds rate a quarter-point, to 5.25 percent.
David Ader, managing analyst with Technical Data in Boston, termed yesterday an uneventful day, with buying interest at the note auction seen coming from central banks and retail investors. "Although today's auction went off without a hitch, the 10- and 30-year auctions will not be as easy," he said.
"The market is currently trading in the middle of a range," Mr. Ader added, "and players don't know if they want to buy or sell. I expect, though, that the market is setting itself up for a buy."
The economic reports issued yesterday were the Mitsubishi Bank/ Schroder Wertheim report on retail sales, which showed salesdown three-tenths of a percent for the week ended Saturday, and the Johnson Redbook report, which put retail sales for the first week in February up seven-tenths of a percent.
Elsewhere in the fixed-income market, Argentina plans to sell $1 billion in five-year bonds within the next several weeks, said an official at Merrill Lynch & Company, which will co-manage the sale with CS First Boston.
Argentina had planned to sell $750 million worth of bonds in January, with those bonds expected to be priced to yield about 425 basis points more than comparable United States Treasury securities. According to traders, Argentine bonds have rallied in recent months as investors bet that the country would emerge from a recession in 1996 and more money would flow into emerging markets.
Bloomberg Business News said the Argentine 8 3/8 percent global bond due in 2003 was trading around 89 1/2, up from 72 on Nov. 15, dropping the yield to 10.35 percent, 485 basis points more than comparable United States Treasury securities.
Slim pickings in higher corporate-grade issues brought investors out for yesterday's junk-bond sale by the El Paso Electric Company, which is emerging from bankruptcy.
Underwriters led by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette priced six maturities running from 3 to 15 years, with the longest maturity priced to yield 8.9 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
Average Price . . . 99.882
Average Yield . . . 5.043%

HEADLINE: Priorities at the Port Authority

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has declared war against the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for shortchanging New York City and favoring the interests of New Jersey. The Port Authority is a great regional resource, but unfortunately many of the Mayor's complaints make sense.
Mr. Giuliani's list of examples of the Authority's alleged favoritism to New Jersey is impressively long. Newark International Airport, for example, has a nifty new arrivals building while Kennedy Airport is still saddled with old, depressing and inadequate facilities that make visitors from abroad feel they are arriving steerage class. 
 Thanks to Port Authority subsidies, mass-transit systems that serve New Jersey commuters, from the PATH service to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, cost less than similar services in the rest of the region. In the same vein, the George Washington Bridge toll is $4 for a two-way ride, compared with $6 for the Triborough Bridge on the other side of Manhattan. Mr. Giuliani complains bitterly about shrinking payments from the city's airport leases, which dropped from $84 million to $3 million over a four-year period.
Mr. Giuliani contends that the Authority has cheated New York City out of $400 million in revenue from leases on the city's airports. He complains about "Hollywood accounting" and the fact that the Authority does not give the city a share of the $3-per-passenger facilities tax. The city is suing to get the money back. The issue will ultimately be decided in the courts or by arbitration.
Whatever favoritism may exist, the Port Authority is run by a board of directors equally divided between New York and New Jersey appointees. If the agency has been shortchanging New York City, it has been with both Governors' support. But New York has wasted its influence on trivial or short-sighted purposes. Gov. Mario Cuomo plundered Port Authority resources to balance his last budget, by getting the Authority to "buy" a parking lot at Aqueduct racetrack from the state. Gov. George Pataki insisted on appointing the executive director, and then used that power to make a weak but politically well-connected choice -- George Marlin, a favorite with the New York Conservative Party.
Right now, the Mayor should be pressing the Authority to complete Kennedy Airport's far-from-finished renovations. J.F.K. desperately needs a better international arrivals building, better transportation between terminals and a long-term solution to the problem of getting passengers to the airport. The Port Authority says it is moving on these projects. But it might be moving faster if it were not spending a disproportionate amount of its resources on the $186-million-a-year PATH subsidy.
The PATH train between Manhattan and New Jersey is a critical prop to the regional economy, like the subways and commuter railroads. But there is no reason the Port Authority should use its money to keep New Jersey commuter costs lower than those for city residents or workers from Long Island or Westchester County. If the Port Authority wants to demonstrate its evenhandedness, it can start by raising PATH fares from $1 to $1.50.
Mr. Giuliani can badger the Port Authority further by lobbying for expansion of the bridge capacity between Staten Island and New Jersey, and for serious thinking about rail freight delivery from the airports. He might even remind the Authority that it was formed in the 1920's to build a rail freight tunnel under the Hudson, a job not yet done.

HEADLINE: A Plan to Put Washington In Maryland

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Frustrated by the District of Columbia's fiscal crisis and the city's lack of representation in Congress, a new citizens group has begun a campaign to give most of Washington back to Maryland.
Under a plan that preserves the Capitol, the Mall and the White House as a Federal enclave, Maryland would get back the 70 square miles it donated for a national capital in 1791. Virginia had provided an additional 40 square miles but reclaimed the land in 1846. 
 "We're not saying it's the only solution," said Lawrence Mirel, a lawyer who was elected last month as president of the Committee for the Capital, a 30-member group promoting retrocession. "But any plan devised for the District must be economically viable and provide full and equal democratic rights. Ours is the only alternative that does."
For now, the idea has no known support beyond a suggestion by Speaker Newt Gingrich last year that District residents be allowed to vote in Maryland, a generous offer given the likelihood that Washington's population of 554,000 would give Maryland one more representative in the House, probably a Democrat. In Washington, the ratio of registered Democrats to Republicans is more than 10 to 1.
"I can't remember even a ripple of interest any time the idea has been raised," said John Allem, a spokesman for Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr.
Dianna Rosborough, a spokeswoman for Gov. Parris N. Glendening of Maryland, said Mr. Glendening would not consider retrocession until "a serious discussion of the issues" made clear what it would mean for the state.
District residents who once pined for statehood, now virtually a lost cause with a Republican-controlled Congress, view retrocession as "ultimate defeatism," as Mark Plotkin, a local political commentator and statehood supporter put it. "Sure, these are rough times," Mr. Plotkin said, "but this is a throw-in-the-towel group."
Still, something has to change, Mr. Mirel insisted, pointing to a local economic tailspin that has led to a decline in services, a shrinking tax base, a steady exodus of middle-class residents to the suburbs, hundreds of millions of dollars in overspending by the city government and, finally, a financial control board, which Congress created last year to restore order.
Progress has been slow. With Congress unwilling to increase the annual Federal payment the District receives in lieu of taxes, Mr. Barry and the control board remain uneasy partners in efforts to cut spending and the size of government. And while they now haggle over $150 million in spending cuts for the 1996 fiscal year, which began last October, streets in full view of the White House remain covered with snow more than three days after the last storm.
In recent years, a variety of solutions have been proposed to lift Washington out of its economic doldrums, but none has generated much support. They have included granting statehood, which Congress opposes; returning the city government to Congressional control, which local elected leaders oppose, and taxing commuters, which members of the Maryland and Virginia Congressional delegations say they will not allow.
But Mr. Mirel said none of those initiatives would solve the city's two most pressing needs -- lifting the local economy and giving local residents voting representation in Congress. Currently, the District has one nonvoting member of the House.
Mr. Mirel said that for Maryland, the economic benefits of retrocession would be enormous, raising the state's population to 5.5 million, or to 15th place from 19th, according to 1992 Census data, and creating a strong Baltimore-Washington market that could compete more effectively with Pennsylvania for new businesses.
The political advantage for District residents would be full representation in Congress, where Maryland has eight representatives.
Mr. Mirel, a 35-year resident of the city, acknowledged that gathering support for retrocession will be difficult. But he predicted that within a year or so, more people will view it as the logical way to proceed.
"Eleanor Holmes Norton told me I'm dreaming," Mr. Mirel said of the District's delegate in Congress. "And none of the elected leaders in Maryland have endorsed or embraced the idea. But fairly soon, I think, people will begin to realize this is it. This is the only answer."

Tagliabue Summons No Support for Antitrust Exemption

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Twice, Paul Tagliabue, the National Football League commissioner, has testified before a United States Senate committee to the need for legal protection to keep teams from hopscotching the country. Twice, he got a favorable reception.
But yesterday, in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, Tagliabue met resistance to his pleading that only an exemption from Federal antitrust laws would provide the league the power to block franchise movement. 
 The hearings were originally called in the aftermath of the Browns' planned move from Cleveland to Baltimore. But since then, the Houston Oilers said they would move to Nashville, and last week, the Seattle Seahawks said they want to start football life anew in Southern California.
With legislation providing an antitrust exemption, Tagliabue believes the N.F.L.'s house would be back in order and owners would not be preparing to vote on the Browns' move Friday.
"I am not certain that legislation is necessary or justified in this case," said Rep. Henry Hyde, Republican of Illinois and chairman of the committee. "What is the compelling public interest here?"
Said Rep. George Gekas, Republican of Pennsylvania, who objects to Government interference, "I come to this hearing with a closed mind."
Even Rep. Martin Hoke, an Ohio Republican who is sponsoring pro-exemption legislation that would let sports leagues enforce their franchise relocation bylaws, parried with the commissioner, saying at one point that Tagliabue had "colossal power" but was unsatisfied without "omnipotence."
Hoke said that the exemption is not enough. "It is not that leagues can't restrict team movement -- it is that they refuse to -- and they refuse to because it is clearly against the owners' economic self-interest to do so," he said.
He accused the league of accruing economic power that has been used in the franchise relocation crisis "as a bludgeon to beat even more money and greater benefits from cities, taxpayers and fans."
Tagliabue said the league stands to suffer great financial loss without Congressional protection and has "become powerless because of exposure to treble damage litigation," that is, the tripling of financial damages in the event of a verdict against the N.F.L. Tagliabue added that an exemption "would allow a sports league to exercise its reasonable business judgment."
Arguing for the exemption was Gary Locke, the King County (Wash.) Executive, who said, "If we let this team leave Seattle with 10 years left on a valid lease, what is to stop any other owner from betraying any other community?"
In an emotional moment, John (Big Dawg) Thompson, a Browns fan clad in a brown team jersey, orange shoes, white pants with a brown and orange stripe and a "dawg collar," choked up as he described his devotion.
"I'm just one fan," he said. "There are hundreds of thousands of N.F.L. fans across the country that have the same investments that I do and also the same feelings."

Asian Markets Start the Year With a Bang

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Asia's stock markets, those darlings of 1993 and the dogs of 1994 and 1995, have come roaring back to life.
Since Jan. 1, stock markets in Southeast Asia are up, up, up. Hong Kong -- which is considered a level above an emerging stock market -- rose 13.7 percent in January. Among the emerging markets, Indonesia climbed 13.1 percent and Thailand 11.6 percent. 
 Is it just the new year's money from fund managers in the United States and Europe, betting that their rallies at home won't last? Or is it something more fundamental? Probably a bit of both.
The immediate cause, fund managers and analysts say, is an influx of cash from overseas. Portfolio-wielding investors sated with their gluttonous gains in the United States over the last year started looking outside the United States and trained their sights intensely on market laggards, namely ones in Southeast Asia.
Although no one tracks international cash flows accurately, some telltale signs point to the proclivities of calendar-conscious fund managers.
"It happened on Dec. 31, and was concentrated on big, liquid, blue-chip stocks," said Richard A. Schmidt, a director at Jardine Fleming Investment Management in Hong Kong. "But is it all U.S.? Maybe not. Is some from Japan? Probably. Is it locals getting in on it? It's that, too. It's a little bit of everything."
The money, sloshing in, tagged almost every Asian market with increased liquidity and daily trading volume. In Hong Kong, for example, daily turnover on that maturing market leaped in January to $794 million worth of stock, up from the 1995's daily trading average of $432 million.
"Prices were not cheap, not expensive," said Elizabeth Tran, chief investment director of IDS Fund Management in Hong Kong. "But the 'little tigers' are supposed to be outperforming everywhere else. And even Hong Kong, the region's best performer last year, didn't do as well as Wall Street."
In Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng index is heavily weighted by property companies, the stock market is extra-sensitive to interest rate changes and their long-term effects on mortgage rates. Recent indications that American interest rates will continue to fall are being interpreted as a thumbs-up.
"When the property companies do well, that knocks right on to the banks," said Roland Bruce, associate director of research at Standard Chartered Securities in Hong Kong. "More managers are starting to reallocate their funds."
The positive effects of lower interest rates, Mr. Schmidt said, will not be limited to Hong Kong, and may actually offer a more fundamental reason for the surge in Southeast Asian stock markets.
Countries throughout Asia are affected by interest rates in the United states, especially in places where the local currencies follow, in varying degrees of closeness, the value of the dollar.
"And guess what? There is, almost in exact order, a correlation between the top-performing markets and how closely their currency is pegged to the dollar," Mr. Schmidt said.
The stock market in Hong Kong, where the currency rises and falls with the dollar, has performed best this year. Indonesia, next closest in dollar linkage, is a close second, followed by the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore.
Even China, where the stock markets open to foreign investors remain tiny, has bounced up this year. Shanghai's B market index jumped 7.9 percent in January.
And at the low end of the scale, Mr. Schmidt pointed out, the progression is the same: the worst-performing market in Asia, the Bombay Stock Exchange, is the least affected by the dollar. It is down down 5 percent as of Monday. Taiwan's stock market is also down nearly 10 percent, and South Korea's market is flat. All of these calculations are in dollar terms.
Politics played heavily in each of those three markets -- Taiwan's stock market took a dive after reports that China had drawn up fresh plans for a possible invasion -- but the trend that Mr. Schmidt noticed held up.
For a dose of pessimism, Ms. Tran suggested a look at economic fundamentals in the region.
Growth rates in Southeast Asia, which have been high, may be hard to sustain. And inflation may be equally difficult to keep under control because world food prices are rising and, in developing countries, account for a large portion of an overall price index.
And anyway, Ms. Tran added, it may soon be time for the money that has sloshed to Asia to slosh in another direction.
"The consensus expectation, worldwide, is extremely optimistic," Ms. Tran said. "That is always troubling."

HEADLINE: Pretoria to Lose U.S. Aid

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The United States will start phasing out aid to South Africa beginning in fiscal year 1997, J. Brian Atwood, Administrator for the United States Agency for International Development, said today. He said that aid cuts were inevitable once a three-year, $600-million-program expires after fiscal year 1996.
Any additional aid will continue to focus on easing the transition from white minority rule to a multiracial South Africa, Mr. Atwood said. 
 South Africa has the world's largest gold reserves, controls the global diamond market and has the most advanced industrial, transport, and communications sectors on the continent. Yet an estimated 40 percent of the work force is unemployed.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Revolt of the Wannabes

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland

 BODY:
As a barometer of global affairs, the annual Davos World Economic Forum is as good an indicator as you can find. The meeting brings together top industrialists and political figures from every corner of the world. Each year, one or two individuals stand out as trend-setters. One year it was Nelson Mandela, then Shimon Peres and Yasir Arafat, then Russian reformers. And that is why this year's Davos Forum was so interesting. Because this year the star -- the man everyone wanted to interview -- was a Communist: Gennadi Zyuganov, head of Russia's resurgent Communist Party.
Think about that. The Davos Forum is the ultimate capitalist convention. It is an annual celebration of globalization -- that loose combination of free-trade agreements, the Internet and the integration of financial markets that is erasing borders and uniting the world into a single, lucrative, but brutally competitive, marketplace. And who is the star but this dinosaur from the Jurassic period of the cold war. How come? 
 It is because the business and political leaders here seem to intuitively understand that Mr. Zyuganov is the cutting edge of a new global trend -- the backlash against global integration and free trade arrangements, which have created many winners but also many losers. The losers are now asserting themselves, whether it is labor unions in France, Pat Buchanan supporters in America or pensioners in Russia.
The Economics Minister of a leading developing country confided to me that his Government was desperate to become part of this new global marketplace. He and his colleagues at the top understand that in order to survive economically and attract foreign investment they have to open up their markets and upgrade their telecommunications, airports and commercial laws. But, he added, "Half the time I am dealing with bureaucrats who don't understand this new game, and half the time I am dealing with workers who are not prepared to compete. We will join in, but it is going to be very painful for some of our people. The cost will be a lot more social unrest and fanaticism. We all have our Zyuganovs."
Another sign of the times was the fact that the day the Davos conference opened, The Herald Tribune ran an essay by Klaus Schwab and Claude Smadja, respectively the founder and managing director of the Davos Forum. It was entitled: "Start Taking the Backlash Against Globalization Seriously." Messrs. Schwab and Smadja are two of the most renowned advocates of global trade and integration. Their essay is the equivalent of the presidents of Ford, G.M. and Chrysler writing an article in the 1960's entitled: "Start Taking Ralph Nader Seriously."
Messrs. Schwab and Smadja wrote that: "Economic globalization has entered a critical phase. A mounting backlash against its effects, especially in the industrial democracies, is threatening a very disruptive impact on economic activity and social stability in many countries. The mood in these democracies is one of helplessness and anxiety, which helps explain the rise of a new brand of populist politicians. This can easily turn into revolt."
It is now clear, they added, that global integration and free trade are not necessarily win-win propositions. Technological advances and productivity increases at corporations don't automatically translate into more jobs at higher wages. Unless countries can help their people adjust to this new world, globalization is going to become synonymous with "a brakeless train wreaking havoc."
When I asked him what prompted him to write the essay, Mr. Schwab said: "In the 19th century people thought the machine was going to destroy their life as they knew it, and today many people think that globalization is going to destroy their life as they know it. We have gotten accustomed to the idea that globalization will inevitably succeed. But I am not so sure anymore. Those of us who believe in globalization need to be more pro-active."
He's right. And the successful governments will be those able to design the right formula of worker training programs, tax policies that create jobs and preserve resources, population controls and sustainable social safety nets to deal with globalization. The good news is that many world leaders are beginning to understand this challenge. The bad news is that no one has found the formula yet.

HEADLINE: Technology Stocks Lift The Market

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
A recovery in technology stocks accelerated yesterday, lifting the market broadly higher.
Confident that technology companies will buck a sluggish economy, investors drove up shares of I.B.M., Intel and Micron Technology. 
 "There's a lot of hope out there that their profit growth is still strong," said Steven Zenker, money manager at McCabe Capital Managers in King of Prussia, Pa.
The Dow Jones industrial average surged 52.02 points, to a record 5,459.61. It was the ninth record so far this year for the Dow, which has risen 5.2 percent in the last two weeks. The Dow gain was led by I.B.M., which touched a 52-week high of 115 1/8 before retreating.
Technology also drove the Nasdaq composite index, which is rich with technology issues. The index gained 5.74 points, to 1,089.08. Since hitting a low of 988.57 for the year on Jan. 15, the Nasaq has risen 10 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 4.90 points, to a record 646.33.
The records came even as one prominent market strategist advised investors to cut their stock holdings. Charles Clough of Merrill Lynch & Company, the nation's largest securities firm, recommended that clients lower the amount of American stocks in their model portfolio to 45 percent from 50 percent. He warned that the economy "is nearing recession conditions."
I.B.M. closed up 2 1/2, to 114 3/4, bringing its gain for the year to 26 percent. I.B.M. contributed more than 7 points to the Dow's gain. Intel led the Nasdaq advance, rising 1, to 59 1/2.
Among other makers of computer chips, Micron Technology jumped 4 1/4, to 41 7/8. CS First Boston raised its opinion on Micron to "buy" from "hold."
Smith Barney raised its opinion on Texas Instruments, which makes both chips and computers, to "buy" from "neutral." The stock rose 1 1/2, to 54 5/8.
Inso surged 2, to 47, a day after reporting fourth-quarter profit of 34 cents a share, surpassing analysts' estimates by 10 cents. The software company's stock has risen 14 percent in the last two days.
Broderbund Software tumbled 7 1/8, to 46, after the company, which makes entertainment and educational software, said it expected earnings for its second quarter ended Feb. 29 to fall below analysts' estimate of 58 cents.
Airline stocks soared and helped push the Dow Jones transportation average up 36.59 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1991.75. In the last few days, USAir Group; UAL, the parent of United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines increased fares for the second time in two weeks.
Delta shares jumped 1 3/4, to 71 7/8; UAL climbed 1 1/2, to 163 1/4; AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose 2 7/8, to 81, and USAir advanced 1/2, to 15 3/4.
Bank shares were among the best performers, as falling bond yields and the prospect of still-lower interest rates improved the outlook for earnings. When borrowing costs fall for banks, they are able to keep more of the money they take in on personal loans, credit cards and mortgages.
Chase Manhattan climbed 1 1/8, to 68 5/8; Nationsbank jumped 3/8, to 69 1/2, and Banc One rose 7/8, to 37 7/8.
Hershey Foods led the advance in food issues after the company announced that it would buy back as much as $200 million of its common stock in three years. Hershey rose 2 3/8, to 73 5/8; Sara Lee gained 1 1/2, to 34 1/2, and H. J. Heinz climbed 1 3/8, to 35.
American International Group added 3 1/2, to 99 3/8, after Dow Corning said it had reached a tentative settlement with the insurer over reimbursement for claims stemming from silicone breast implant lawsuits.
Knight-Ridder gained 2 3/4, to 68 3/8, after Investor's Business Daily reported that the company's financial unit could be bought by the Thomson Corporation.

HEADLINE: Haitian Taking Office, With Daunting Job Ahead

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The task facing Rene Preval beginning Wednesday is one no Haitian envies. As the successor to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, he inherits what one diplomat here calls "the hardest job in the Americas": trying to lead a country that historically has been the poorest and most blatantly misruled in the hemisphere.
As if that were not enough, Mr. Preval will be governing in the shadow -- and many believe under the thumb -- of the charismatic, popular and dominant Mr. Aristide. Indeed, there is widespread suspicion that the new President is merely keeping the office warm until Mr. Aristide can return in five years. 
 Add to that Mr. Preval's need to maintain good relations with the United States, which in the past has viewed him as something of a dangerous radical, and with the United Nations-sponsored military force that has been here since September 1994.
He also takes on vital unfinished business, including economic reforms that even Mr. Aristide, with his great popularity and moral authority, was unwilling to carry out.
All of this will temper the joy of the transition, the first peaceful hand-over from one democratically elected President to another since Haiti's independence in 1804.
"The situation is difficult," Mr. Preval, a slight, bearded and reserved figure, conceded in an interview here this week, his first since winning 88 percent of the vote in an election in December that saw more than two-thirds of the electorate stay home. "My mission is to bring everyone together and create confidence so a social partnership can emerge."
Mr. Preval, 53, is to be sworn in Wednesday amid signs the United States and other countries that have supported the restoration of democratic rule here are scaling back their commitment to Haiti. As a result, Mr. Preval, who served as Mr. Aristide's Prime Minister in 1991 but has never before held elective office, will be forced to rely on his own wits and resources to an extent his better-known predecessor has not, even as he struggles to establish an identity independent of Mr. Aristide.
In the interview, the President-elect said that his two top priorities would be protecting the people from political violence and rebuilding the economy. He said he recognized he must make a quick start on both fronts to win popular support.
Unwilling to risk his popular standing by demanding popular sacrifice, Mr. Aristide made little effort to set a direction in either area since Prime Minister Smarck Michel resigned four months ago, and popular nervousness over the shape of the post-Aristide era has been growing.
Mr. Preval said recent outbreaks of violence, including lynchings in the slums of the capital, indicate that the country's new police force still needs help from the United Nations to do its job. He said he welcomed an extension of the United Nations presence here, scheduled to expire at the end of the month, through the summer, but hesitated to ask for a longer commitment.
"Let's go with six months, and afterward we will evaluate the situation," said Mr. Preval, who spoke mostly in French, with an occasional foray into English. "After all, the United Nations also has financial problems."
The Clinton Administration, which sent more than 20,000 soldiers to Haiti in September 1994 to restore Mr. Aristide to power, has decided not to continue as part of that smaller United Nations force. Instead, all American troops are scheduled to be withdrawn by spring, to be replaced largely by Canadians.
Even many of his countrymen have regarded Mr. Preval as a shadowy and secretive figure whose beliefs and policies have largely been unknown. He has worked closely with Mr. Aristide for more than a decade, but until now has always preferred to remain out of the limelight.
Unlike the humbly born Mr. Aristide, who in the past has described their relationship as "so close, people say we are twins," Mr. Preval comes from an urban, middle-class background. His father was a government minister in the 1950's, but the family was forced into exile in 1963 during the dictatorship of Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier and Mr. Preval later studied at a university in Belgium.
As an exile, Mr. Preval also lived for about five years in New York City in the 1970's. "I was working in a French-language book store, in Queens first and then in Manhattan," he recalled. He returned to Haiti in the early 1980's and opened a bakery.
During his brief tenure as Prime Minister, he and Mr. Aristide planned a dramatic social transformation based on redistributing Haiti's scant wealth from the privileged mulatto elite to the impoverished majority. The alarmed rich encouraged the military to overthrow Mr. Aristide, and Mr. Preval accompanied the President to exile in the United States.
He was Mr. Aristide's closest confidant in Washington and after the President was restored to power became the director of his patronage operation, rewarding supporters with development projects and jobs.
Lacking any independent constituency, Mr. Preval has derived all his power from Mr. Aristide. In office, it is generally believed that he will still depend on Mr. Aristide to prod the party faithful and rally the public behind whatever initiatives he undertakes.
Mr. Aristide, who under the Constitution may not succeed himself, has not discouraged speculation that he intends to return to office after Mr. Preval's term expires.
In the past, Mr. Preval has had a somewhat edgy relationship with American officials. But he said he was not offended by the American decision to pull out and does not regard it as a lack of confidence in him, arguing that the make-up of the United Nations force is less important than its resolve.
"I understand that they have some difficulties and that because of those difficulties they will not be able to participate," he said of the Clinton Administration. "But the essential thing is a force with good equipment and training to help our police do this job."
An equally pressing piece of unfinished business is the privatization of state enterprises, which Mr. Aristide proved unwilling to carry out and which led to the disintegration of his first Cabinet. As a result, foreign aid to Haiti has slowed to a trickle and the Government now appears likely to run out of money by the spring if progress cannot be made.
Mr. Preval has had a reputation as a man of the left, deeply suspicious of private enterprise and foreign investment. But in the interview he said he intended to "modernize the state" in order to satisfy international lending agencies, a process he said included "not spending money on public enterprises that lose money" and "making sure the private sector participates in the management" of such companies.
"How do you define man of the left?" he responded when asked about his image as an economic nationalist. "Is it that we have nationalized the resources of the country? I ask them to see the relationship we have with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank during the next six months."
By training, Mr. Preval is an agronomist, and he indicated that he would promote land reform to improve prospects for the 70 percent of the Haitian population that still lives in the countryside.

HEADLINE: No Salvation From the Governors

 BODY:
The nation's governors voted unanimously at their conference yesterday for reforms of welfare and Medicaid that are harsher toward the poor in key respects than anything Congress has passed or that the Republicans privately negotiated with President Clinton in their ill-fated budget talks. This unfortunate outcome is the price for achieving the governors' primary goal of protecting state treasuries. What they did not achieve is a proposal that would guarantee essential security for the impoverished. A civilized, wealthy society should do no less.
On Medicaid, the governors said their plan would split the difference between turning the health insurance program over to the states to run, as the G.O.P. wants, and preserving the existing entitlement that poor families have to medical coverage. But the entitlement has shriveled. The governors' plan would guarantee undefined medical benefits to a diminished group of recipients. 
Under current law, families receiving Federal welfare assistance automatically qualify for Medicaid. But under the governors' plan, states would not have to cover adults or children over age 12, no matter how poor. Worse, the loosely worded requirement would allow states to skimp on hospital and other benefits, making an entitlement of questionable value even for those eligible.
The governors propose giving themselves plenty of room to reduce state Medicaid funds. Gov. George Pataki of New York, for example, would "win" the right to reduce state contributions by 20 percent without sacrificing any Federal money. Nationwide, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that states could cut their own spending on Medicaid by about $200 billion over seven years under the plan. The governors did improve the Congressional plan in one respect by agreeing to spend more Federal money in states whose Medicaid rolls rise. But whether the formula would truly protect states from soaring Medicaid enrollments is unclear.
The governors' welfare proposal rips away the Federal guarantee of additional money for states experiencing rising welfare rolls, as the President unwisely invited the Republicans to do. It puts a five-year cap on benefits even for adults who can find no job. The proposal would also allow states to make huge cuts -- up to 30 percent -- in the money they spend on welfare. The Federal Government would have little ability to force states to treat their poor residents fairly.
Nor would the plan provide enough money for states to maintain cash and other assistance while also putting recipients to work. The governors would make unacceptable cuts in food stamps and, borrowing the worst planks from the Congressional plan, would allow states to opt out of the Federal food stamp program and cut off childless adults after four months who cannot find work. If that happens, Americans -- who might, under the plan, be losing cash assistance and medical insurance -- would no longer be guaranteed a minimal, federally defined food benefit.
Many Americans held out hope that the bipartisan National Governors' Association would succeed in welfare and Medicaid reforms where Congress and the President miserably failed. But the governors proved parochial. They made sure that Federal law would let them do pretty much as they please when taking care of the poor. That might be a terrific solution for those who believe that states, left alone, would have the will and ability to act generously. But several governors, including Mr. Pataki, are already planning to slice welfare benefits. Over the past two decades, many states have allowed benefits to wither under the force of inflation.
It is not that state legislatures or governors are mean-spirited. States are simply the wrong place to set benefit levels for the poor. They are under tremendous pressure to balance budgets and cannot do so if they take care of the poor in ways that attract more poor families and repel taxpaying families and corporations. The governors say it is unfair to think they would shortchange the poor. The plan they passed overwhelmingly says the opposite.

HEADLINE: Moderating Path, Rowland Aims At Healing of Connecticut Cities

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Riding the Republican wave to scrap the Great Society programs of the 60's, Gov. John G. Rowland last year won bipartisan approval to remove families from welfare after 21 months -- the nation's strictest time limit -- and to cut their checks 7 percent.
Now, with the next session of the Legislature opening on Wednesday, Mr. Rowland has rejected additional cuts in welfare for families and embraced an issue rarely associated with the Republican Party: revitalizing the state's ailing cities. 
 Mr. Rowland's new focus has caught both Republicans and Democrats here off guard, but as Democrats nationally are trying to cast Republicans as too extreme, it is one in a series of moves that Republicans nationwide have taken to soften their conservative images.
To be sure, Mr. Rowland's budget proposal is expected to include cuts in social service programs and other state operations. Yet in touting his concern for cities and vowing to protect programs for the elderly and for children, he has joined a number of Republican governors who have steered a more moderate path, as the conservative agenda in Washington has met with growing opposition.
Last month, Gov. John Engler of Michigan, known for his deep cuts in welfare, has proposed higher spending on child care services and transportation for welfare recipients. Gov. Pete Wilson of California focused his State of the State address last month on teen-age pregnancy, not mentioning the affirmative action and illegal immigration issues that have divided his state. And in New Jersey, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has rejected cuts in welfare benefits, instead emphasizing programs that encourage welfare recipients to take jobs.
"They're not going soft and mushy, but they're trying to cast their policies in such a way that they will be broadly popular, not just popular among the most conservative of their constituents," said Mark Rom, a political science professor at Georgetown University. "That's much different from the Republicans in Congress who are much more hard-edged conservatives."
Many Democrats view Mr. Rowland's urban agenda, focusing on economic development, as a political strategy to broaden his base in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a ratio of roughly 3 to 2, and they caution that it may provide cover for further cuts in state government.
Mr. Rowland dismisses such critiques and says he has steered a steady course. He complained that he was wrongly cast as a conservative, and claimed the mantle of a moderate, citing his support for state financing for the arts and culture, among other programs.
"In the Northeast," Mr. Rowland said, "the interesting thing is if you took, for example, Weld, Rowland and Whitman, and throw in Pataki" -- a reference to the Republican Governors William F. Weld of Massachusetts, Mrs. Whitman of New Jersey and George E. Pataki of New York -- "I suspect Pataki would be the most conservative of the four of us."
"Weld might even be tougher than we are on some of the fiscal issues," Mr. Rowland said. "He's really hard-nosed. I would say Christie and I are really close."
Over the last few months, Mr. Rowland surprised Republican state senators by rejecting their plan to cut welfare benefits for families even further. He rescinded cuts in rental subsidies to the elderly and promised not to touch a program that helps them buy prescriptions. He also unveiled legislation to strengthen the Department of Children and Families, which oversees 30,000 children, and promised to hire more employees there. In an interview, he also talked about improving drug prevention and treatment programs.
Mr. Rowland said he never intended his budget cuts to affect the elderly, though last February he proposed phasing out the rental assistance program that serves the elderly and the poor. His welfare program is intended to help people break a cycle of dependency and find work, he said, and the deeper cuts sought by Republican senators were not needed in a program that he described as the "most aggressive in the nation."
Mr. Rowland also said his action on behalf of children transcended any political label, with the state aggressively intervening in a way that officials of all parties once shied away from.
And Mr. Rowland, who comes from the blue-collar city of Waterbury, sees his urban agenda as a continuation of his effort to correct problems caused by the Great Society programs of the 1960's.
"My urban agenda is to tear down the mess that we've made in our cities," he said in a interview on Sunday on a Sharon radio station. "The Federal solution has been let's go to Waterbury, New Haven, Hartford, Bridgeport and we'll build a massive warehouse called public housing, put all the poor people there. The developers get rich, the people in those houses become drug dependent, welfare dependent.
"All the social service problems exist in one community, and unfortunately, we drive out everyone else."
Now what needs to be done, he said, is "to tear down the buildings, to tear away the infrastructure that has maintained welfare dependency," create more opportunities for home ownership and use public-private partnerships to pursue economic development.
The plan to help the cities is, to some extent, a logical follow-up to last year's changes in the state welfare law. If Mr. Rowland's plan is to succeed, he must find work for roughly 50,000 welfare recipients. To do that, jobs must be created in the cities where most of them live.
At the heart of the plan are "neighborhood revitalization zones," a Democratic initiative passed last session, that would waive environmental and zoning regulations to give cities more flexibility to redevelop blighted areas.
But Mr. Rowland may take this idea a step further. In an interview, he said he was interested in creating tax-free zones in certain cities to attract businesses there, an idea that Governor Engler championed in Michigan.
Mr. Rowland's urban proposals are likely to complement the urban agenda that the Speaker of the State House of Representatives, Thomas D. Ritter, a Democrat, released last week, and some Democrats see political motives for the Governor's stand.
"His focus on cities, while it may not turn out to be more than talk, is a way of saying we're not what they're about in Washington," Kevin B. Sullivan, the Democratic minority leader in the State Senate, said. "How far it goes, in terms of actually making a difference, remains to be seen. If nothing else, it shows that the Governor is a gifted politician."
Betty Gallo, a lobbyist in Hartford for welfare advocacy groups, said: "I think what we've seen nationwide is a realization by leaders that the American public thinks they've gone too far, that the cuts have been dangerous, particularly to older people and children. That is what Governor Rowland is responding to."
She warned against seeing the move as evidence of a "kinder and gentler John Rowland," and with the state facing a deficit in next year's budget, Mr. Rowland will present more cuts on Wednesday, including substantial reductions in General Assistance, a welfare program for single adults.
In his own party, Mr. Rowland's urban agenda has the support of legislative leaders but runs the risk of alienating suburban residents who have traditionally been the heart of the state's Republican Party.
"It doesn't turn me on," said Representative Raymond V. Collins, a Republican of West Haven. "There are those of us here who say the suburbs have been hosed for years by Democrats, and now its our turn."
In turn, Mayor John DeStefano of New Haven questioned whether it could have any impact if state spending, which he said was weighted to the suburbs, was not adjusted.
And Mr. DeStefano, a Democrat, said he was surprised by the Governor's sudden focus on the issue. "He didn't talk a lot about it in his campaign, though it's less important to me how he got here than where he'll go," he said.
Still, Mr. Rowland's supporters say that his concern with cities is long held, dating from his first election to the State House of Representatives in 1980, and that he is charting a new course for his party. He recently appointed a state party chairman, State Representative Chris DePino, a New Haven Republican known for breaking with the party line, to add more of an urban slant.
In an interview, Mr. Rowland insisted that helping the cities did not mean taking from the suburbs. The residents of the cities do not want handouts and are sympathetic to the conservative messages that he has made the centerpiece of his administration, he said.
"I won Bridgeport in 1990," he said, referring to his previous, unsuccessful run for office, "and I came within about 900 votes of winning it this time. I didn't win Glastonbury, I didn't win Simsbury," two well-to do suburbs that Mr. Rowland described as havens for "limousine liberals."
"My point is that people don't understand the cities," he continued. "The cities are much more conservative than you think they are. These people want the death penalty. They want welfare reform."
Mr. Rowland said that he had always planned to pursue an urban agenda, but that it did not make sense to do it his first year.
"I had to look at what were the immediate problems, where was the sense of urgency," Mr. Rowland said, "and that answer was the biennial budget, welfare reform, which is the backdrop of urban redevelopment, improving the business climate and certainly the crime issues. You can't help the cities until you've addressed those other problems."

HEADLINE: Apple Computer Talks With Sun

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Despite widespread public speculation that Apple Computer Inc. had broken off merger talks with Sun Microsystems Inc. last week, executives from the two companies met secretly at a Palo Alto, Calif., law firm over the weekend, people familiar with the discussions said today.
It could not be determined whether the meetings indicated that the companies were considering a merger, or other types of strategic alliances. 
 Apple and Sun have been reported to be discussing a merger, and Apple's board has considered several offers from Sun, people familiar with the negotiations said. Last week, however, Apple's board decided to accept the resignation of Michael Spindler, its chief executive, and replace him with Gilbert F. Amelio as chairman and chief executive.
Many industry analysts have said that the move indicated that Apple was going to try to solve its financial crisis independently. However, some people familiar with Apple's financial situation have suggested that it may be more severe than is publicly known.

HEADLINE: A BILLION AT RISK: A special report.;
Public Money Foots the Bills For 'Privatized' Foreign Aid

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Business does it better. That is the rallying cry on Capitol Hill and in statehouses across the country, where legislators are turning over to private companies traditional government functions ranging from running jails to exploring outer space.
But an experiment in "privatizing" foreign aid has shown that the private sector does not offer a guaranteed cure for problems that critics say have plagued traditional foreign assistance programs: mismanagement, ineffectiveness, political infighting and conflicts of interest. 
 All these have cropped up at the Czech and Slovak American Enterprise Fund, part of a program that now involves more than $1 billion of taxpayers' money and some of Wall Street's biggest names. Similar funds have suffered from some of the same -- though less severe -- problems.
Congress started the enterprise funds in 1989 to foster capitalism in Poland and Hungary, and the program soon spread to other formerly Communist countries. The funds were to invest in Eastern European companies, much as Wall Street's venture-capital funds finance start-up or struggling businesses. There was one big difference: taxpayers, not investors, put up the money.
And it is the taxpayers who face the losses in the Czech and Slovak fund. Government documents obtained by The New York Times under the Freedom of Information Act and from both critics and supporters of the program -- as well as interviews with United States officials, former fund employees and American executives familiar with the program -- draw a picture of failure at the fund:
*Bad investments appear to have eaten up a third to two-thirds of its$26 million investment portfolio.
*The costs of running the fund are surging, to $3 million last year.
*The fund has made few loans to small businesses.
*It has not developed and trained local people.
*It has had little, if any, effect on government policies in either the Czech Republic or Slovakia.
The fund "is failing to achieve either commercial success or developmental impact," according to an independent evaluation done last year by Development Alternatives Inc. of Bethesda, Md., for the United States Agency for International Development, which provides the money for the program. "The investments are suffering major losses, and are generally marginal both in market and in development terms," the evaluation said.
Furthermore, the fund's longtime chairman was ousted from its board in November after a Federal investigation involving procurement problems and accusations of conflicts of interest. The United States Attorney's office in Washington says it is considering whether to bring charges in the matter, at the heart of which is the former chairman's personal relationship with his assistant and payments for computer work that the fund made to a third person who is part of their household.
Also, a key member of the fund's volunteer board, who pushed to remove the chairman and improve the fund's performance, was himself forced out in December by directors loyal to the old chairman -- and a second board member quit in protest. The Clinton Administration is expected to decide in the next few weeks if the fund can be salvaged or should be closed.
The Czech and Slovak fund's experience, critics say, shows that trying to meld business practices and government policies can lead to the worst of both worlds: a program that is vulnerable to political meddling, but lacks the accountability that businesses have to their investors as well as the rules and regulations that government uses to keep its employees in line and programs on track.
The problems at the fund have emerged at a time when the program as a whole is growing rapidly in size and importance, even as traditional foreign assistance falls victim to tight Federal budgets and doubts about its effectiveness. And the program is expanding to some countries that have almost no experience with capitalism.
Today there are 10 funds with total capital of $1.3 billion that can invest in more than a dozen countries, including Albania, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. And more are probably on the way: Croatia and Macedonia are lobbying for funds of their own, for example.
Doing business in these countries is clearly difficult, which obviously accounts for some of the funds' troubles. And venture-capital investing always involves a lot of risk.
To be sure, many of the funds are too new to have track records, and at least one, in Poland, is widely regarded as a big success.
But some people who have investigated the funds say that problems stem from the very nature of the program. "I think you can say there is potential for abuse," said Robert R. Chapman, an assistant United States attorney in Washington.
Because the funds would be venturing into terra incognita, the so-called SEED Act of 1989 (SEED stands for Support for Eastern European Democracy) did not specify any targets for them to meet. Instead, it set two broad mandates: to help develop the private sector and to promote policies and practices necessary for capitalism. What would happen if the funds lost all their money -- or even made a profit -- was left unclear.
To insure that they have enough flexibility to do their work, the funds are subject to little control from Washington. Instead, each is run by an unpaid board originally picked by the President. The boards vote to approve new members suggested by the White House, and can vote out current members, making the boards almost completely autonomous.
The boards have included some of the best-known names on Wall Street and in Washington: E. Gerald Corrigan, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; W. Michael Blumenthal, former Secretary of the Treasury; John C. Whitehead, former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company; John Train, the investment adviser and author, and John P. Birkelund, chairman of Dillon, Read & Company.
But as the number of funds has grown, finding and keeping strong directors has become more difficult. "There are not enough good people," said one longtime Congressional aide who insisted on anonymity.
At the Czech and Slovak fund, two of the most experienced directors -- David O. Maxwell, former president of the mortgage giant known as Fannie Mae, and former Representative Charles A. Vanik, an Ohio Democrat -- resigned in 1994 and 1995, respectively, and were replaced with friends of the chairman.
 
Central Figure
A Banker but Not A Venture Expert
From the fund's inception in 1991, that chairman was John R. Petty, an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Nixon Administration who retired in 1988 as chairman of the Marine Midland Bank of New York.
Mr. Petty is not a venture capitalist, however, and that may partly account for some of the problems with the fund's investments.
One measure of those problems is the amount of money the fund shows as reserves, basically the amount it expects to lose on its investments. In the year ended September 1995, those reserves more than doubled, to $9.6 million from $4.3 million. The 1995 figure represents 37 percent of its investments.
The two board members who recently left, Joseph S. Fichera and Robert M. Rubin, suggest the level of reserves should be much higher; one investment professional familiar with the portfolio has suggested 65 percent. While the other funds also have reserves, they are far lower; the Polish fund's expected losses amount to about 8 percent, but that is almost matched by projected gains.
Among the troubled investments of the Czech and Slovak fund are bakeries that went broke, a joint venture with an American company that was supposed to produce fertilizer and cattle feed, and companies that make everything from charcoal briquettes to motorcycles.
"It was the blind leading the blind," said Harvey M. Schuster, an American who runs the Corus Funds, a mutual fund company in Prague. "The Czechs didn't know how to manage and the Americans didn't know how to invest."
Mr. Petty was interviewed in November and again last week. In a brief telephone interview Thursday from Hawaii, where he was vacationing, Mr. Petty said that the main issue was risk and that the fund's original board "did not believe Congress created the fund to do transactions that would compete with private funds." He canceled a longer interview scheduled for Friday and could not be reached for further comment but later provided extensive written material.
 
Managing Risk
Hands-On Way To Run a Fund
In the past, Mr. Petty has said that the fund's problems date from its early days, when he said it was under pressure from the State Department and the Agency for International Development to make investments more quickly than he would have liked, according to several people with whom he discussed the matter. Executives of other funds have made similar complaints.
While the fund's investments have performed poorly, the Czech economy has been booming and its entrepreneurs thriving. Indeed, international aid organizations are so confident that the Czech Republic will prosper without further help that they are pulling out of the country.
Not surprisingly, the State Department has suggested that the fund wind down its Czech operations and focus on Slovakia, where the economy is faring poorly.
Despite difficult circumstances, most of the fund's problems "are related to management," according to a report by the Institute for East West Studies, a New York research center that is generally a big fan of the fund program.
At the successful Polish fund, the board sees its job as "finding the right people to run it and supporting them," said the chairman, Mr. Birkelund. "If I tried to run it myself, that would be impossible."
But Mr. Petty, who is 65, took a different approach. Unlike other fund chairmen, he did not have a substantial job in the private sector. Instead, he had his own office at fund headquarters, in Washington, and was involved in daily operations. At times he also served as chief executive, again in an unpaid capacity. Even after he stepped down as chairman last August, he remained a director and chief executive.
In a memo he wrote last October to the new chairman, Lawrence McQuade, Mr. Petty said that in the beginning he served as a hands-on executive to get the fund up and running quickly, as the State Department had requested. He intervened later when various people did not work out, according to the memo. The fund has gone through several chief executives in its brief history and is now searching for a new one.
But former employees, including Stephen L. Wald, who served as the fund president in Prague in 1992, and Karel Kosman, former head of the Prague office, complained that Mr. Petty's involvement amounted to interference. Mr. Petty says he was simply trying to enforce accountability. Both men resigned under pressure from Mr. Petty within a year.
 
Questions Arise
Mixing Business And the Personal
Mr. Petty probably could have continued as chairman and chief executive except for two developments. One was the arrival on the board of two Wall Street executives unconnected to him: Mr. Fichera, a former investment banker at Bear, Stearns who is now a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson School of International Studies at Princeton, and Mr. Rubin, executive vice president of the AIG Trading Group, which trades commodities and currencies.
The other development was complaints made in December 1994 by some fund employees in Prague that led to an investigation by the inspector general of the Agency for International Development.
According to a report of the investigation obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, in 1991 Mr. Petty put his longtime assistant on the fund's payroll, and soon got her a raise of more than 50 percent, to $85,000. They became romantically involved and in October 1992 he moved in with her but did not formally inform the board of this until last March.
The assistant, Alexandra Ossipoff, resigned last July after admitting that in 1991 she had fabricated documents in an effort to get the fund and its sister Hungarian American Enterprise Fund, with which it shared an office, to pay $1,500 for computer consulting work, according to the inspector general's report. The work was done by another member of her household in McLean, Va., named Judy Shaw.
Mr. Petty, the report said, ordered the chief financial officer of the two funds to pay the $1,500 in a memo that included the fabricated documents, which were supposed to make it look as if the funds had obtained competitive bids on the computer work. The inspector general's report says that Mr. Petty approved other bills and signed checks to the consultant even after they were living in the same house.
Over all, Ms. Shaw received about $100,000 from the two funds while living with Ms. Ossipoff, according to several people familiar with the transactions. In an interview earlier this week, Ms. Shaw said that while she could not confirm the exact figure, $100,000 was "in the ball park"; she said that it included not just several years' worth of consulting services, but also hardware she purchased for the funds.
Describing herself as an expert in Eastern European telephone systems and noting that the Czech and Slovak fund's staff "felt free to call me 24 hours a day," Ms. Shaw said "they certainly got their money's worth." She also said that no one raised concerns about the fact that she shared a house with Ms. Ossipoff or complained to her about the computer system she installed. (Among the grievances expressed by Mr. Wald and Mr. Kosman, the former fund officials, however, were problems with the computer system, according to the inspector general's report.)
Repeated attempts over the last week to reach Ms. Ossipoff were unsuccessful. There was no response to messages left at her house and with Mr. Petty.
In his memo to Mr. McQuade, Mr. Petty defended Ms. Ossipoff's salary as proper given her experience, responsibilities and hard work, and said that the fund's chief executive at the time was aware of their relationship.
He described Ms. Shaw as "an unusually reliable, experienced, favorably priced, first-rate supplier." He said he did not know at the time that Ms. Ossipoff had fabricated bids, an action he called "stupid and pointless in the extreme," but stressed that the work was performed at a fair price and that taxpayer money was not misused.
 
Road to Resignation
An Official's Visit Brings On an Exit
In various letters and documents, Mr. Petty repeatedly said that the inspector general's report found no evidence of wrongdoing. And he suggested that the Agency for International Development might be looking for problems at the fund to justify the agency's existence at a time when Congress is considering cutting its budget.
The inspector general's report said its findings had been discussed with prosecutors, who were described as saying that Federal criminal statutes had not been violated because the fund is not a Government agency. But the United States Attorney's office said recently that it had not reached a conclusion and that the matter remained open.
The development agency did not see the inspector general's report as an exoneration of Mr. Petty, Michael D. Sherwin, the agency's procurement executive, told the fund board's audit committee at a meeting in October. In a memo he prepared for agency files, Mr. Sherwin said that he explained to the directors that the inspector general did not make recommendations in its investigations and that that fact should not be taken to mean it believed there had been no wrongdoing.
"I went on to tell the committee that had these matters involved Federal employees, these employees would indeed be facing criminal indictments and immediate administrative action to remove them from their jobs," wrote Mr. Sherwin, who said he attended the meeting at the request of the White House.
He then told the committee that if it did not do something about Mr. Petty, the Government might close the fund, according to his memo.
Mr. Petty, who has denied all wrongdoing, could not be reached for a specific response to Mr. Sherwin's memo.
In an interview, Mr. Sherwin said that he appeared before the committee, a highly unusual action in the fund program, because of "the nexis of the relationship of the woman doing the phony bids, the woman who got the job and the chairman." While such links might be acceptable on Wall Street, he added, "these were things we could not tolerate."
After Mr. Sherwin left the committee meeting, Mr. Petty agreed to resign, although he did not do so for another month.
 
Change of Command
Longtime Ally Steps Into Post
The board's new chairman, Mr. McQuade, did not press for the resignation. Mr. McQuade, a former Assistant Secretary of State who recently left Prudential Mutual Fund Management, joined the board at Mr. Petty's request. The two have been friends "since we were Young Turks on Wall Street," Mr. McQuade said, adding that he was "much more sympathetic to John than some people are; after all, he gave of his life to build the fund and was not getting paid for it."
Shortly after Mr. Petty left, Mr. Fichera, his chief critic, was voted off the board and Mr. Rubin quit.
Mr. McQuade said that Mr. Fichera's dismissal had nothing to do with Mr. Petty's departure; rather, he said, it was because of a personality conflict. But both Mr. Fichera and Mr. Rubin said the dismissal was an attempt to direct blame for the fund's problems toward the very person who was trying to fix them.
As a result of all this turmoil, the fund's future is unclear, although the Clinton Administration seems likely to recommend changes and may try to merge the fund with a more successful fund or close it down. A lawyer for the fund's audit committee, Robert C. Odle of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, said that the issues raised in the inspector general's report were "examples of the fund's serious corporate-governance problems." He said other funds would be able to avoid such problems by separating the chairman and chief executive functions, as the State Department recently suggested.
Nonetheless, the debacle at the Czech and Slovak fund calls into question the autonomy of the funds as a whole, and the power that is vested in their boards.
"The funds should move more into being government-type things or pure private sector -- to inject some accountability," Mr. Rubin said. As it is, he added, "they are neither fish nor fowl."

HEADLINE: GOVERNORS RAISE HOPES FOR ENDING BUDGET DEADLOCK

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The nation's governors endorsed bipartisan proposals today for overhauling the Federal Medicaid and welfare programs, prompting optimistic talk of breaking the monthslong impasse over balancing the Federal budget. But the proposals also drew questions from the White House and Congress and criticism from advocates for the poor.
President Clinton, Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, and Speaker Newt Gingrich praised the governors' ideas -- adopted unanimously at the winter meeting of the National Governors' Association here -- as steps in the right direction. Mr. Dole and Mr. Gingrich promised prompt hearings on the proposals, which seek a middle ground between the White House wishes for guaranteed benefits and the Republicans' insistence on more autonomy for the states. 
 But the White House raised several objections to the specifics of the proposals; Congressional Republicans said it was still unclear whether the President was prepared to negotiate in good faith, and advocates for the poor said they would vigorously contest limits on benefits in the welfare proposals that, they said, could hurt the needy. [Article, page 14.]
Moreover, senior White House officials made it clear that they saw no possibility of serious negotiations with Congress until after the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary later this month sorted out the Republican Presidential field, and Mr. Dole's prospects, a bit more.
Still, in a speech to the governors this morning, Mr. Clinton said their idea of preserving a Federal guarantee of medical benefits for needy people, and of broad new flexibility for states to administer such programs, had "contributed immeasurably" to resolving disputes between the White House and Congress. He made similar comments about the governors' proposals for overhauling welfare.
Mr. Dole praised the governors as "honest brokers" and added, "We're prepared to act, and we believe the President will be prepared to act, too." Mr. Gingrich promised prompt hearings on the proposals. His spokesman, Tony Blankley, described the Speaker as "ecstatic" at the governors' efforts.
Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, a Republican who heads the governors' association, described the Medicaid proposal as "the break that they're looking for."
Mr. Dole said this afternoon that the Senate would move quickly to consider the governors' recommendations in hearings conducted by the Senate Finance Committee.
"I think they've done an outstanding job," he told reporters. "And we believe it puts a lot of good pressure on Congress and President Clinton to come together on the rest of the balanced-budget package."
Indeed, the governors' recommendations carry some moral and political weight, not only because they come from a diverse group but also because the governors are the public officials most immediately concerned with delivering the health and welfare services at stake.
Their proposals sought to reconcile the tensions between the states' growing insistence that they have more freedom and flexibility to administer such programs and their concern for protecting their residents and their own budgets from fluctuations in the economy.
Broadly put, the Administration and many Congressional Democrats want to maintain Federal guarantees of, and supervision over, assistance to poor people in the Medicaid and welfare programs, while Congressional Republicans want to turn money over to the states in lump sums to distribute as the states see fit.
The governors' proposals, and the carefully supportive but noncommittal reaction to them, showed both the extent and the limits of their effort to reconcile such conflicting demands.
"It's more evidence that there's momentum out there for a deal," said a senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity. "But while the candidates are trooping through the frozen snows of Iowa and New Hampshire, the prospects for a deal are frozen, too."
The White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said that among the Administration's concerns about the Medicaid proposal was just what standards would be set for a nationally guaranteed package of medical benefits and how to set eligibility guidelines to preserve benefits for all those currently entitled to them -- the elderly, the disabled, children and pregnant women.
And while the White House praised one major aspect of the governors' proposal on welfare -- the call for more money for child care -- and commended Senator Dole for embracing it, Mr. McCurry raised questions about other aspects of the plan. In particular, he said it called for guaranteeing that states maintain their welfare efforts at only 75 percent of current levels, not the 80 percent that the President has previously suggested was the minimum he would accept.
Mr. Clinton, who once headed the governors' association as Governor of Arkansas, was more effusive than his spokesman, calling the governors' proposal on Medicaid "a very impressive accomplishment." And he singled out Mr. Dole for praise, saying he had shown a "genuine spirit of cooperation."
The Kansas Senator was equally magnanimous, though he could not resist a gentle dig at the President.
"Now the biggest parlor game in Washington, besides trying to figure out who wrote 'Primary Colors,' is trying to decide whether or not President Clinton wants a real balanced-budget agreement," Mr. Dole said, referring to the new, anonymously written novel about the 1992 Clinton campaign.
"I think he does," the Senator continued. "Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm willing to take him at his word. We spent 50 hours together in different meetings -- most time I've ever spent at the White house. I hope to be there longer later."
It has long been clear that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole would be willing to cut a deal, if not for the objections of more conservative House Republicans led by Mr. Gingrich. White House officials said they were surprised and pleased that Mr. Dole, a front-runner in the 1996 Republican Presidential race, had not struck a more partisan note in his speech.
White House aides also said they took it as a given that the Senator's ability to force a compromise with the House side would be enhanced, or diminished, depending on his showing in the Iowa and New Hampshire contests.
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Human Resource Subcommittee, said that panel would conduct the House hearings on the governors' recommendations. But in announcing this, he fired off one of the few partisan shots of the day.
"The President has vetoed two welfare bills and we have become frustrated with his inaction on this issue," Mr. Archer said, adding that with the governors' proposal, "welfare reform is back on track in spite of the President's obstinateness."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Truth and Shades of It as Dole and Forbes Fight On

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 6

 BODY:
The Presidential candidates have mostly withdrawn from New Hampshire this week to concentrate on the battle for Iowa. But on television here, the warring commercials of Senator Bob Dole and Steve Forbes are more pervasive than ever.
Late last week, the Dole campaign began broadcasting a commercial in which Gov. Stephen Merrill of New Hampshire, standing outdoors, dressed casually and looking straight at the camera declares: "Steve Forbes's income tax plan increases the deficit and raises our taxes. The typical New Hampshire household will pay $2,000 more in taxes. And we lose our property tax deduction and mortgage interest deduction." 
 The commercial had two main purposes: to call attention to the endorsement of Mr. Dole by the Governor, probably the most popular politician in New Hampshire, and to raise doubts about Mr. Forbes's flat-tax proposal, the issue that has unexpectedly propelled the publishing executive out of the pack and into a close race with Mr. Dole.
Mr. Forbes responded this week with two advertisements in which an off-screen male voice essentially calls Mr. Dole a liar. One begins, "Bob Dole is misleading homeowners about Steve Forbes's flat tax and the mortgage deduction." The other begins, "The Concord Monitor reports Bob Dole is running a negative ad, with Steve Merrill in it, that is not accurate."
The Forbes commercials offer numbers on screen illustrating how the "average" home-owning family would see its Federal income tax cut under Mr. Forbes's plan for a flat tax of 17 percent, no deductions and personal exemptions of $13,000 for adults and $5,000 for children.
Campaigning in Iowa, Mr. Forbes challenged Mr. Dole to a debate on the flat tax. Mr. Dole declined but said Governor Merrill would be happy to debate Mr. Forbes. Mr. Forbes declined.
Then the Dole campaign released a new television spot. It labels as false and misleading a Forbes commercial that accuses the Senator of voting to "tax our Social Security benefits." The Dole commercial then goes on to reproach Mr. Forbes as planning to end Social Security and supporting forced retirement at 65.
The truth, according to Internal Revenue Service figures from tax returns in 1993, is that the Forbes flat-tax plan would probably lower the income taxes of homeowners with modest incomes. Those figures are for the last year for which complete data are available.
A rough calculation shows that a home-owning family of two adults and two children with an income, all in wages, of $45,000 and taking the average deductions such families claimed nationwide in 1993 for mortgage interest, property taxes and charitable contributions (the only deductions that most New Hampshire families that own homes can claim) would owe about $3,900 in income taxes under the existing law and about $1,500 under the Forbes plan.
But Mr. Dole is on solid ground when he maintains that the Forbes plan would increase the Federal budget deficit. The Treasury Department has estimated that a flat tax would result in a loss of revenue that would raise the deficit by $200 billion a year. Private forecasters using conventional computer models of the economy mostly agree with that estimate. Most economists believe that it would take a flat tax of 25 percent to increase the Treasury's revenue. And even at that rate, the four-person family earning $45,000 would owe only $2,250 in income taxes.
The Forbes commercial accusing Mr. Dole of voting to increase taxes on Social Security benefits is only partly true. The Senator did vote for legislation that, among many other provisions, would have raised taxes on Social Security benefits of upper-income retirees.
The Forbes campaign acknowledges that Mr. Forbes settled out of court an age-discrimination suit filed by a former secretary. But it denies that Mr. Forbes wants to end Social Security or favors forced retirement at age 65.

HEADLINE: Governors' Welfare Plan Seeks to Close Gap on Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The welfare legislation endorsed today by the nation's governors would give states vast new power to design their own cash assistance programs and to devise ways of moving poor people from welfare to work.
The governors proposed giving each state a lump sum of Federal money to run its own welfare program. Like Congress and President Clinton, the governors would impose a five-year limit on payment of Federal welfare benefits to any family. 
 But under the governors' proposal, low-income people would still be entitled to food stamps if they met Federal eligibility criteria, and there would be no statutory limit on the cost of the food-stamp program, which is financed entirely by the Federal Government.
The governors supported most of the welfare bill that President Clinton vetoed last month, but they recommended numerous changes in the bill to address his concerns. For example, they suggested adding money for child care, rewarding states that find jobs for welfare recipients and increasing the size of a contingency fund for states with high unemployment.
Nevertheless, the proposals drew criticism from some advocates for the poor. Mr. Clinton thus finds himself once again in a ticklish political position, trying to show voters that he can "end welfare as we know it" without alienating an important bloc of supporters.
At its winter meeting here, the National Governors' Association also formally approved a policy statement on Medicaid that was informally endorsed on Monday. The proposal would give state officials new authority to design and operate health programs for poor people, but the Federal Government would still guarantee coverage for certain groups of people and certain benefits.
In a speech to the governors today, Mr. Clinton said their proposals would help break a deadlock between the Administration and Congress on welfare and Medicaid.
"I believe we're going to pass welfare reform legislation," Mr. Clinton said, telling the governors: "You have contributed immeasurably to helping us to resolve the impasse over Medicaid. You have contributed to the impulse to move to genuine welfare reform."
While he commended the governors for their effort, Mr. Clinton said he had a few reservations about their proposals. Administration officials later amplified those concerns. Democratic advocates for children and the poor were even more negative.
Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, a longtime friend of Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, criticized the governors' welfare proposal on the ground that it would not preserve a Federal guarantee of assistance for needy children. She said it would "leave many children poorer, hungrier, sicker and at greater risk of abuse and neglect."
Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a frequent adviser to Democrats in Congress, expressed alarm.
"The governors are a special-interest group, trying to maximize Federal aid and increase their ability to withdraw state money from welfare and Medicaid," he said. "Their proposal is, in many key areas, harsher than the Senate-passed welfare bill, which would have added more than a million children to the ranks of the poor."
House Republicans, rejecting such criticism, said they were delighted with the proposals and would try to pass legislation doing what the governors want.
"I hope the President won't derail it this time," said Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Florida Republican who heads the Ways and Means subcommittee responsible for welfare legislation. Another Republican said the governors' welfare proposal merited a grade of "8 or 9 on a 10-point scale, with 10 being everything the Republicans want."
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said he welcomed the proposals. "I think that the governors have done an excellent job of holding on to the principles that the Democratic Party represents in both welfare and Medicaid reform," Mr. Gephardt said. But he cautioned that "the devil is in the details."
The governors' broad conceptual agreements could come apart as Congress specifies the details needed to write legislation. Members of Congress said they had no idea what the governors' proposals would cost. Governors said the proposals would save money, but the Congressional Budget Office will not be able to estimate the savings until the proposals are reduced to legislation.
Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, a Republican who heads the governors' association, said, "This is a very fragile package, very, very fragile."
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader and a Republican candidate for President, said the governors' agreement "puts a lot of pressure on the leadership in Congress and the President of the United States, a good kind of pressure."
In a speech to the governors, Mr. Dole said, "The fact that you've come together ought to be an inspiration to us," and he predicted that it would be "a big, big plus in our efforts to get a bipartisan agreement" in Congress.
The governors said Congress should increase the money available for child care, adding $4 billion to the $18 billion that would be provided under the welfare bill in the next seven years. They would offer bonuses to states that exceed Federal goals for putting welfare recipients to work. The governors took no position on whether Congress should restrict welfare, food stamps and other types of assistance for legal immigrants who have yet to become citizens.
Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, a Democrat, said: "The welfare policy had problems, in my view, but I'm a team player. I was not trying to throw my body in front of it. Government is the art of compromise."
Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, both Republicans, said the policies endorsed by the governors would be immensely helpful to their states.
Medicaid is financed jointly by the Federal Government and the states. One of the changes recommended by the governors would significantly reduce the fiscal burden of Medicaid on states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, where per-capita income is relatively high.
Under current law, the Federal Government pays 50 percent of Medicaid costs in these states. Under the governors' proposal, the Federal share would be increased to 60 percent, so the states would be responsible for no more than 40 percent.
In her budget message to the New Jersey Legislature last week, Mrs. Whitman offered numerous proposals to move people from welfare to work. But many are subject to Federal approval. Under the policy recommended by the governors' association, New Jersey could make those changes by itself, without seeking permission from the Government.
Under the governors' proposal, state Medicaid programs would be required to guarantee certain services, like physician and hospital care, laboratory tests and X-rays. But the proposal said states should have "complete flexibility in defining the amount, duration and scope of services." Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services said that as a result, states could restrict benefits so severely that the guarantee of Medicaid coverage would become virtually meaningless.
The governors' proposal would guarantee Medicaid for poor children through the age of 12. Stan Dorn, director of the health division at the Children's Defense Fund, said the governors' proposal would also repeal a 1990 law that eventually guarantees Medicaid coverage for poor children from age 13 through 18. This change, he said, would deny Medicaid to three million children who would otherwise be entitled to Medicaid in 2002.

U.N. Chief Urges Reducing U.S. Dues

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said today that he favored reducing the United States contributions to the United Nations budget from 25 percent to 15 or 20 percent.
He said a reduction would lessen the dependence of the United Nations on Washington and "better reflect the fact that this organization is indeed the instrument of all nations." 
 The United States now owes the United Nations at least $1.5 billion, and Washington's failure to pay has contributed significantly to the most serious financial crisis ever faced by the organization.
European nations stepped up their criticism of the United States today. After the Secretary General's speech, Francesco Paolo Fulci, Italy's representative, spoke for the European Union when he said that "the organization should get serious about imposing penalties on members who are consistently late and in major arrears."
American officials do not want the assessment cut below 20 percent because of concerns about a lessening of Washington's influence.

HEADLINE: We Can't Afford Voodoo 2

BYLINE: By Herbert Stein; Herbert Stein, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, was chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The experienced Republican Presidential candidates are amazed at the surge of Steve Forbes. They shouldn't be. They prepared the way for Steve Forbes. Indeed, they made him inevitable. 
 At least since the time of Andrew Mellon, the idea that taxes are evil has been forefront in the Republican creed. Ronald Reagan refined the creed: Taxes are not only evil; they are also unnecessary. In the post-World War II era, the party's platform has had two main planks -- anti-Communism and anti-taxes. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the platform is down to one plank.
Of course, responsible Republican officials could not live by their own ideology. Once in Washington, they had to recognize that taxation is a legitimate and necessary function of government. So, President Dwight Eisenhower found himself repeatedly resisting calls for tax reduction. In 1969 President Richard Nixon resisted a drive for a big tax cut led by Senator Albert Gore Sr., a Democrat and father of the current Vice President.
President George "Read My Lips" Bush agreed to a tax increase in 1990. Bob Dole, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, took the lead in raising taxes in 1982. And every other veteran Republican Senator has agreed to a tax increase or resisted a cut.
This is now a problem for Republican candidates who have held office. They want to show their adherence to the Republican anti-tax creed. But their own records, and their appreciation of the realities of the budget, keep them for doing so unreservedly. So the way is clear for a candidate uncontaminated by prior contact with the Federal budget, who can sing that old sweet song, "Let Me Cut Your Taxes, I Just Love Your Vote." That gives us Steve Forbes and the flat tax.
Of course, the term "flat tax" is a diversion. What it means is "low tax." No one is trudging through New Hampshire trying to sell a 25 percent flat tax. It has to be a 17 percent flat tax or some other impossibly low number because the flat tax is terribly unflat in its impact on different people, depending on whether they have home mortgages or employer-provided health benefits, and so forth
To be attractive, the flat tax has to be low enough so that even those most disadvantaged by it get something. Such a low rate would lose a lot of revenue, but that doesn't bother Mr. Forbes, because he hasn't yet encountered the Federal budget. That is presumably what he means when he boasts of not being a Washington insider.
 Thus cutting taxes serves all purposes in the Forbes campaign. You want 4 percent economic growth? Cut taxes! You want 4 1/2 percent interest rates? Cut taxes!
You want foreign policy? Cutting taxes will make America such a model society that the Serbs, Croats and Bosnians will stop shooting one another and emulate us. You want anti-crime policy? Cut taxes on legal income and you will eliminate the incentive to engage in illegal activity. You want fewer single mothers? Eliminate the tax code's marriage penalty.
The "insider" candidates find it hard to deal with this. They can't say that the Forbes tax rate is much too low. There is no such thing in the Republican campaign lexicon -- or in the Democratic one either -- as a tax rate that is too low.
The political mythology that cutting taxes is the sure road to electoral success is an indication of how few politicians know history. After the Republican 80th Congress cut taxes in 1948, Harry Truman won an election that he wasn't supposed to win. After the Republican 83rd Congress cut taxes in 1954, Democrats took control of the House for 40 years.
Yes, there was one politically successful tax cutter: Ronald Reagan. Mr. Forbes's friends like to compare him to Mr. Reagan. But there are critical differences. For one thing, Mr. Reagan had spontaneous charm. Also, Mr. Reagan had two big issues on which to base his 1980 campaign -- Communism and inflation -- and he later deal with both successfully. And he even went on to raise taxes by his second year in office.
The country faces an entirely different fiscal situation today than in 1980. Then the Federal debt was 26.8 percent of the gross domestic product, only slightly above its postwar low. The ratio today is more than 50 percent, and without a radical change it will likely exceed 100 percent in the next generation. We could afford Ronald Reagan once. We cannot afford him again.
Meanwhile, I'm cool. As far as I can figure it out, the Forbes flat tax would save me a lot money.

HEADLINE: Priorities at the Port Authority

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has declared war against the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for shortchanging New York City and favoring the interests of New Jersey. The Port Authority is a great regional resource, but unfortunately many of the Mayor's complaints make sense.
Mr. Giuliani's list of examples of the Authority's alleged favoritism to New Jersey is impressively long. Newark International Airport, for example, has a nifty new arrivals building while Kennedy Airport is still saddled with old, depressing and inadequate facilities that make visitors from abroad feel they are arriving steerage class. 
 Thanks to Port Authority subsidies, mass-transit systems that serve New Jersey commuters, from the PATH service to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, cost less than similar services in the rest of the region. In the same vein, the George Washington Bridge toll is $4 for a two-way ride, compared with $6 for the Triborough Bridge on the other side of Manhattan. Mr. Giuliani complains bitterly about shrinking payments from the city's airport leases, which dropped from $84 million to $3 million over a four-year period.
Mr. Giuliani contends that the Authority has cheated New York City out of $400 million in revenue from leases on the city's airports. He complains about "Hollywood accounting" and the fact that the Authority does not give the city a share of the $3-per-passenger facilities tax. The city is suing to get the money back. The issue will ultimately be decided in the courts or by arbitration.
Whatever favoritism may exist, the Port Authority is run by a board of directors equally divided between New York and New Jersey appointees. If the agency has been shortchanging New York City, it has been with both Governors' support. But New York has wasted its influence on trivial or short-sighted purposes. Gov. Mario Cuomo plundered Port Authority resources to balance his last budget, by getting the Authority to "buy" a parking lot at Aqueduct racetrack from the state. Gov. George Pataki insisted on appointing the executive director, and then used that power to make a weak but politically well-connected choice -- George Marlin, a favorite with the New York Conservative Party.
Right now, the Mayor should be pressing the Authority to complete Kennedy Airport's far-from-finished renovations. J.F.K. desperately needs a better international arrivals building, better transportation between terminals and a long-term solution to the problem of getting passengers to the airport. The Port Authority says it is moving on these projects. But it might be moving faster if it were not spending a disproportionate amount of its resources on the $186-million-a-year PATH subsidy.
The PATH train between Manhattan and New Jersey is a critical prop to the regional economy, like the subways and commuter railroads. But there is no reason the Port Authority should use its money to keep New Jersey commuter costs lower than those for city residents or workers from Long Island or Westchester County. If the Port Authority wants to demonstrate its evenhandedness, it can start by raising PATH fares from $1 to $1.50.
Mr. Giuliani can badger the Port Authority further by lobbying for expansion of the bridge capacity between Staten Island and New Jersey, and for serious thinking about rail freight delivery from the airports. He might even remind the Authority that it was formed in the 1920's to build a rail freight tunnel under the Hudson, a job not yet done.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Revolt of the Wannabes

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland

 BODY:
As a barometer of global affairs, the annual Davos World Economic Forum is as good an indicator as you can find. The meeting brings together top industrialists and political figures from every corner of the world. Each year, one or two individuals stand out as trend-setters. One year it was Nelson Mandela, then Shimon Peres and Yasir Arafat, then Russian reformers. And that is why this year's Davos Forum was so interesting. Because this year the star -- the man everyone wanted to interview -- was a Communist: Gennadi Zyuganov, head of Russia's resurgent Communist Party.
Think about that. The Davos Forum is the ultimate capitalist convention. It is an annual celebration of globalization -- that loose combination of free-trade agreements, the Internet and the integration of financial markets that is erasing borders and uniting the world into a single, lucrative, but brutally competitive, marketplace. And who is the star but this dinosaur from the Jurassic period of the cold war. How come? 
 It is because the business and political leaders here seem to intuitively understand that Mr. Zyuganov is the cutting edge of a new global trend -- the backlash against global integration and free trade arrangements, which have created many winners but also many losers. The losers are now asserting themselves, whether it is labor unions in France, Pat Buchanan supporters in America or pensioners in Russia.
The Economics Minister of a leading developing country confided to me that his Government was desperate to become part of this new global marketplace. He and his colleagues at the top understand that in order to survive economically and attract foreign investment they have to open up their markets and upgrade their telecommunications, airports and commercial laws. But, he added, "Half the time I am dealing with bureaucrats who don't understand this new game, and half the time I am dealing with workers who are not prepared to compete. We will join in, but it is going to be very painful for some of our people. The cost will be a lot more social unrest and fanaticism. We all have our Zyuganovs."
Another sign of the times was the fact that the day the Davos conference opened, The Herald Tribune ran an essay by Klaus Schwab and Claude Smadja, respectively the founder and managing director of the Davos Forum. It was entitled: "Start Taking the Backlash Against Globalization Seriously." Messrs. Schwab and Smadja are two of the most renowned advocates of global trade and integration. Their essay is the equivalent of the presidents of Ford, G.M. and Chrysler writing an article in the 1960's entitled: "Start Taking Ralph Nader Seriously."
Messrs. Schwab and Smadja wrote that: "Economic globalization has entered a critical phase. A mounting backlash against its effects, especially in the industrial democracies, is threatening a very disruptive impact on economic activity and social stability in many countries. The mood in these democracies is one of helplessness and anxiety, which helps explain the rise of a new brand of populist politicians. This can easily turn into revolt."
It is now clear, they added, that global integration and free trade are not necessarily win-win propositions. Technological advances and productivity increases at corporations don't automatically translate into more jobs at higher wages. Unless countries can help their people adjust to this new world, globalization is going to become synonymous with "a brakeless train wreaking havoc."
When I asked him what prompted him to write the essay, Mr. Schwab said: "In the 19th century people thought the machine was going to destroy their life as they knew it, and today many people think that globalization is going to destroy their life as they know it. We have gotten accustomed to the idea that globalization will inevitably succeed. But I am not so sure anymore. Those of us who believe in globalization need to be more pro-active."
He's right. And the successful governments will be those able to design the right formula of worker training programs, tax policies that create jobs and preserve resources, population controls and sustainable social safety nets to deal with globalization. The good news is that many world leaders are beginning to understand this challenge. The bad news is that no one has found the formula yet.

HEADLINE: No Salvation From the Governors

 BODY:
The nation's governors voted unanimously at their conference yesterday for reforms of welfare and Medicaid that are harsher toward the poor in key respects than anything Congress has passed or that the Republicans privately negotiated with President Clinton in their ill-fated budget talks. This unfortunate outcome is the price for achieving the governors' primary goal of protecting state treasuries. What they did not achieve is a proposal that would guarantee essential security for the impoverished. A civilized, wealthy society should do no less.
On Medicaid, the governors said their plan would split the difference between turning the health insurance program over to the states to run, as the G.O.P. wants, and preserving the existing entitlement that poor families have to medical coverage. But the entitlement has shriveled. The governors' plan would guarantee undefined medical benefits to a diminished group of recipients. 
Under current law, families receiving Federal welfare assistance automatically qualify for Medicaid. But under the governors' plan, states would not have to cover adults or children over age 12, no matter how poor. Worse, the loosely worded requirement would allow states to skimp on hospital and other benefits, making an entitlement of questionable value even for those eligible.
The governors propose giving themselves plenty of room to reduce state Medicaid funds. Gov. George Pataki of New York, for example, would "win" the right to reduce state contributions by 20 percent without sacrificing any Federal money. Nationwide, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that states could cut their own spending on Medicaid by about $200 billion over seven years under the plan. The governors did improve the Congressional plan in one respect by agreeing to spend more Federal money in states whose Medicaid rolls rise. But whether the formula would truly protect states from soaring Medicaid enrollments is unclear.
The governors' welfare proposal rips away the Federal guarantee of additional money for states experiencing rising welfare rolls, as the President unwisely invited the Republicans to do. It puts a five-year cap on benefits even for adults who can find no job. The proposal would also allow states to make huge cuts -- up to 30 percent -- in the money they spend on welfare. The Federal Government would have little ability to force states to treat their poor residents fairly.
Nor would the plan provide enough money for states to maintain cash and other assistance while also putting recipients to work. The governors would make unacceptable cuts in food stamps and, borrowing the worst planks from the Congressional plan, would allow states to opt out of the Federal food stamp program and cut off childless adults after four months who cannot find work. If that happens, Americans -- who might, under the plan, be losing cash assistance and medical insurance -- would no longer be guaranteed a minimal, federally defined food benefit.
Many Americans held out hope that the bipartisan National Governors' Association would succeed in welfare and Medicaid reforms where Congress and the President miserably failed. But the governors proved parochial. They made sure that Federal law would let them do pretty much as they please when taking care of the poor. That might be a terrific solution for those who believe that states, left alone, would have the will and ability to act generously. But several governors, including Mr. Pataki, are already planning to slice welfare benefits. Over the past two decades, many states have allowed benefits to wither under the force of inflation.
It is not that state legislatures or governors are mean-spirited. States are simply the wrong place to set benefit levels for the poor. They are under tremendous pressure to balance budgets and cannot do so if they take care of the poor in ways that attract more poor families and repel taxpaying families and corporations. The governors say it is unfair to think they would shortchange the poor. The plan they passed overwhelmingly says the opposite.

Big Dawg Barking Up Wrong Tree

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW 

 BODY:
IN the formal chamber of the august House Judiciary Committee Tuesday, a beefy man in a brown football jersey, wearing orange shoes and a dog collar took his seat, placing on the witness table before him a big orange bone and a dog-faced hat.
This was John Thompson, a k a Big Dawg because he is the founder of the Cleveland Browns' rooting section in Cleveland Stadium known as th' Dawg Pound. He is one of those who, among other things, on cold Sunday afternoons barks at opponents. 
 On Tuesday, Big Dawg No. 1 appeared out of his customary canine element to testify as, he said, "basically a nonelected representative of the Cleveland Browns' fans" on just how important a sports franchise is, and the grief specifically it would cause the fans of the Cleveland community if Art Modell, the owner of the Browns' football team, is allowed to carry out his plans to move the team to Baltimore.
"I'm just one fan," Thompson, a season-ticket holder for 18 years, said emotionally. "There are hundreds of thousands of N.F.L. fans across the country that have the same investments that I do and also the same feelings."
In fact, the only financial investments Thompson has in the team are his Browns jersey and the dawg accouterments that accompanied him into the halls of Congress. There is a substantial emotional investment by many fans into their local teams, to be sure, and it is a meaningful point.
But aver all, Thompson's major investment is his romanticism for the team that in actuality should be named the Modell Browns. It is clear that they are not Cleveland's, since Modell could have moved them to Shanghai if he had wanted to -- whenever he wanted to -- and no amount of growling by Big Dawg could have changed it.
The same is true for the Steinbrenner Yankees, the Mara-Tisch Giants, the Paramount Knicks and Rangers. As well, of course, the O'Malley Dodgers.
Now the lawmakers are looking into a proposal by the National Football League to give it an antitrust exemption so it could prevent a franchise from just up and leaving a community, as Houston will, to Nashville; as the two Los Angeles teams recently did, to St. Louis and Oakland; as the Seattle team is threatening to do, to L.A.
The N.F.L., which will ta'e up the Browns' proposed move at an owners meeting in Chicago today and tomorrow, shouldn't have it. Why should the Government intervene in a private entertainment business? It is highly doubtful, for example, that it would put its foot down if Hollywood studios decided to move to Cleveland. And from a purely economic standpoint, such a move would be of greater financial loss to a community because of the jobs it provides.
"When the Dodgers left Brooklyn," said Neil Sullivan, professor of public administration at Baruch College, and author of "The Dodgers Move West," "the economy of Brooklyn did not collapse. No more than the economy of the South Bronx revived when the Yankees stayed to renovate Yankee Stadium with $120 million of New York City taxpayers' money. The kinds of jobs lost by the departure of a ball club -- ushers, vendors, and so forth -- may hurt a relatively few families, and that should not be minimized, but those kind of jobs do not determine the economic future of a community the size of Brooklyn or the Bronx."
It hurts to have a sports franchise, which one has grown up with, move. It is a symbol, a totem, in many ways of the community. But it is often little more than t'at. In fact, many of the people who lament the leave-taking, say, of the Dodgers, had themselves left Brooklyn for the suburbs, in some cases even before the ball club did.
Flabby politicians often buckle to the extortion demands of sports franchise owners. But when referendums are put to the public to ask if they want to pay for stadium improvements which, naturally, include the building of luxury boxes for the rich, they have often said no. Twice voters in San Francisco and twice in San Jose rejected recent referendums to build new ball parks.
Now George Steinbrenner is seeking more than $600 million for a new ball park in the area. What if that money was put into the schools, the police and fire departments, the housing and the transportation system of the South Bronx?
That would go a longer way toward making the area "major league" than gilding Steinbrenner's luxury boxes.
All big cities suffer similar living problems. Cleveland included. And bread ought to come before circuses, even for Big Dawgs.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Who's Losing Russia?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT

 BODY:
The lights are going out all over Russia. Because believers in democracy -- not a majority, but a plurality backed by a free press -- are split into sullen factions, they may deliver Russia back to Communist or some other form of tyranny.
The enemy of reform is its hero of yesteryear. Because Boris Yeltsin and his Kremlin clique fear personal punishment from left or right should they lose power, they are making it impossible for the center to hold. 
 Yeltsin maintains the pretense of reform but has given it a bad name. His need to hold protective office prevents real reformers from presenting a single candidate against the Communists and fascists.
Western governments foolishly abet this division of the democrats by trying to boost Yeltsin's chances of clinging to power. Publicly, we support the $9 billion loan to Russia by the I.M.F., to be construed as a vote of confidence in Yeltsin -- though many Russians believe the money will be diverted to armaments and add to inflation.
Privately, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany passed along to Washington a Kremlin request that statements calling for NATO expansion to Poland be downplayed through June, to save Yeltsin embarrassment after he announces next week.
Such overt and covert propping up of the sclerotic regime is foolish. Just as Western governments' taking sides in Russia's election would backfire, aiding the Reds and browns, we should not intervene by encouraging Yeltsin to hang on, thereby dividing the democrats.
But individual Westerners -- from investors to pundits -- should not hesitate to urge Russian reformers to cut the squabbling and get their act together.
The name of the presidential game is to get into the two-man runoff. One finalist is likely to be the Communist Gennadi Zyuganov. The other could be Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the nationalist wild man; Gen. Aleksandr Lebed, nationalist but not wild, still popular though his party failed in parliamentary elections; Yeltsin, or Grigory Yavlinsky, the only reformer to win a base in Parliament.
Many of the other reformers are sore at Yavlinsky because he rejected unity last year. His strategy was to dissociate himself from the way that Yeltsin's economic aides -- Yegor Gaidar, Boris Fyodorov and the privatizer Anatoly Chubais, fired last week -- botched the transition to a market economy. Yavlinsky could truthfully say "I told you so," and avoid the Yeltsin taint. By going it alone, he survived politically, while voters rejected the others.
Now they're in deep sulk because Yavlinsky is the only reformers' game in town. Gaidar is muttering about supporting Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, who's not even in the race, and Chubais dreamily wishes Yavlinsky would abandon hope and support Yeltsin because "otherwise the Communists will win and Grisha [Yavlinsky] will be in prison along with me."
That dog-in-the-manger attitude is understandable but unrealistic. The parliamentary election centered on economics; the presidential will decide between freedom and tyranny.
In the runoff, Yeltsin is sure he could beat Zhirinovsky, which explains why he is surreptitiously helping his campaign now; But Yeltsin would likely lose to the Communist Zyuganov. Yeltsin might not even make it to the runoff; even if he did, and dramatically changed his mind on Chechnya and won in an upset, his election would spell doom for free-market democracy.
That leaves Yavlinsky. Yes, he's a long shot, but so is everybody else. If democratic reformers quietly united, that would push him into the high teens, within striking distance of the 25 percent or so needed for the runoff, and a sure bet if Yeltsin steps aside or falls ill again. There is talk in Moscow of a reformers' coalition with Lebed, who is anti-Communist and anti-Yeltsin, and might find attractive the Defense Ministry and later a reconstituted vice presidency.
The Communist vote, mainly pensioners and former apparatchiks, is solid but far from a majority; if the runoff posed a plain choice between Communist past and democratic future, the democrat could surprise.
But nothing is possible without reformist unity. That might persuade Boris Yeltsin -- the man now "losing Russia" -- to once again play the patriot and stop splitting the movement he betrayed.

HEADLINE: Yale Clerical Workers Strike as Talks Stall

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Clerical workers at Yale University went on strike this morning, setting up picket lines that led many professors to hold classes off campus in churches, movie theaters and private homes.
The walkout came less than a month after graduate teaching assistants abandoned a job action involving the withholding of students' grades. They had begun the action in an attempt to win recognition for their union, but they did not succeed. 
 Union leaders said that nearly 2,000 workers, who handle much of the paperwork on campus, had set a one-month deadline for the first phase of the strike. If the contract dispute is not resolved in that time, they said, maintenance, dining hall and custodial workers will follow. All belong to locals of the Federation of University Employees. The average salary of the clerical workers is $25,000 a year; the other workers are paid an average of $30,000.
The unions are seeking raises, better pension benefits and an end to subcontracting with nonunion labor, but their major concern is job security.
"People don't go on strike for a quarter-an-hour raise," Deborah Chernoff, a union spokeswoman, said. "They feel their livelihood is being threatened."
The unions today offered to submit the dispute to binding arbitration, but university negotiators refused.
For its part, the university, which has been running an operating deficit for five years, is seeking changes in the contract to help hold down costs by means of what a spokesman, Gary Fryer, calls "greater freedom to manage its work force." That might entail the hiring of outside workers and the creation of a two-tier pay scale so that new employees would earn less and have less costly benefits than present staff members.
Student opinion about the strike was mixed. Ramzi Zein, a fifth-year economics student, said: "I fully sympathize with the strikers. What they're doing is necessary to keep the administration in check."
Other students seemed indifferent. Kevin Shertzer, a junior majoring in history, said: "It's like the O. J. Simpson trial. You hear so much about it, you turn your ears off."
Craig Yacks, a sophomore majoring in American Studies, spoke for many students when he said, "As long as it doesn't affect me, I'm not interested."
Yale has a long history of labor disputes. Although the last two contracts were settled amicably, in 1984 a 10-week strike closed campus dining halls, and in 1977, the university endured a 13-week labor dispute. There were also walkouts in 1971 and 1974.
Ms. Chernoff charged that Yale was "more interested in the bottom line than in living up to its lofty ideals."
But Mr. Fryer contended that union demands for improved benefits were farfetched since Yale already provides "the most generous benefits package" of any competing university in the country, including free health insurance and up to $8,400 a year in scholarship aid per child for the children of workers.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
California propositions are antilawyer, and no joke.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
MANY people talk of cutting lawyers down to size. The Alliance to Revitalize California has a plan to do it.
This unusual coalition of politics-shy Silicon Valley executives and seasoned consumer advocates has declared war on civil litigation they consider excessive. Should the three propositions they managed to place on California's March 26 ballot pass, thousands of lawyers may be looking for new jobs. 
 Of the three initiatives, the one that has galvanized support from Intel, Intuit, Seagate, Symantec and Cypress Semiconductor is Proposition 201 -- "shareholder litigation reform" aimed at curtailing class-action suits that end in greenmail for plaintiffs' lawyers. But Proposition 202, the "lawyer contingent fee limitation" prohibiting lawyers from taking more than 15 percent of an easily negotiated settlement, would affect more people. And Proposition 200, "pure no-fault auto insurance," would radically alter the legal landscape.
Indeed, the no-fault initiative, which would virtually eliminate litigation over auto accidents, is so revolutionary that it deserves a closer look. "We've finally found a way to bullet-proof auto insurance from the greed of the trial lawyers," argues Jeffrey O'Connell, a professor of law at the University of Virginia who has spent much of his career promoting no-fault.
The logic is simple: when someone is injured in a car accident it is costly to assign blame, and the contest creates uncertainty for those injured. With no-fault, insurers simply pay for the medical care and lost income of their own customers.
But no-fault has never fully delivered on its promise to slash litigation because plaintiffs' lawyers have managed to write loopholes into state laws. Where injuries exceed a threshold, usually set by the cost of medical treatment, the injured party can sue for "pain and suffering" as for economic losses. And in states without no-fault, practically anything goes: 20 cents of the auto insurance premium dollar in California ends up in lawyers' pockets.
Proposition 200 would bar suits, except when drunken driving is a factor. The standard policy would provide $1 million in coverage against economic losses. Drivers who want the option of collecting for pain and suffering could insure themselves, much the way they can now buy coverage for uninsured motorists.
The Rand Corporation estimates that pure no-fault costs half as much as current auto liability insurance. Since collision and theft losses would not be affected, the savings on premiums in California would average about 25 percent.
Part of the savings would come from reduced fraud: 99 injury claims are made for every 100 auto accidents in Los Angeles -- triple the national average. As important, says Andrew Tobias, a financial writer and liberal crusader who helped write the initiative, Proposition 200 would sharply improve the odds of receiving compensation. "Who are you going to sue," Mr. Tobias asks, if you are injured by an uninsured driver (28 percent of all motorists in California), or if you injure yourself (16 percent of accidents)? Pedestrians, by the way, would automatically get $1 million coverage from an insurance pool.
The lawyers will not be pushovers. Last year they persuaded the Governor of Hawaii, a former trial lawyer, to veto pure no-fault legislation that would have required insurers to lower liability premiums by 45 percent. And they are not watching from the sidelines in California. In November the Consumer Attorneys of California, a trade association, warned members that "your future as a lawyer is at stake" and sought $99 contributions for its political action committee since only gifts "over $100 are a matter of public record."
More surprising -- and more ominous from the prospective of the sponsors -- consumer organizations are divided on the initiative. Bill Westenmeyer, director of the group that drafted the proposition that rolled back auto insurance premiums in California in 1988, is on the board of the Alliance. So is Mike Johnson, formerly on the staff of Public Citizen, Ralph Nader's lobbying group.
But Mr. Nader opposes no-fault, arguing that it deprives Americans of their right to a day in court. And his long shadow has apparently influenced the view of others. Consumers Union, which for a quarter-century has supported less radical no-fault, is fighting Proposition 200. "The notion that somebody could run a red light, wipe out a family and not pay would lead to frontier justice," argues Harry Snyder of Consumers Union.
Mr. Tobias acknowledges the emotional power of the day-in-court argument, but wonders why the best has become such a potent enemy of the good. He says that Rand found that the most seriously injured -- those with economic losses exceeding $100,000 -- now get an average of just 9 percent in compensation. "Californians would be better protected than they are today, and still save a bundle," he concludes.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Sears Shows Strength in 4th-Quarter Earnings Amid Slowness in Retailing

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
In a quarter expected to be dismal for retailers, Sears, Roebuck & Company proved to be an exception yesterday, reporting a strong improvment in fourth-quarter results.
For the quarter that ended Dec. 30, Sears earned $455 million, or $1.13 a share, down 33.6 percent from $685 million, or $1.74 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. 
 But the quarter a year ago included gains of $134 million from the spinoff of Allstate Insurance and the sale of the Homart Development Company and $195 million from the early repayment of debt. Without those gains, earnings from continuing operations rose 28 percent, from $356 million, or 90 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
The results were slightly higher than estimates of $1.11 a share, according to a survey of analysts by First Call. And the results were especially strong, analysts said, given that the holiday shopping season was one of the worst in 25 years, depressing the profits at most other retailers.
"You'd be hard pressed to find anybody that grew earnings at this rate in the retail industry," said Philip Abbenhaus, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Company in St. Louis.
Shares of Sears surged $1.625 yesterday, to $44.25, on the New Stock Exchange
Sears said sales rose 7 percent, to $10.85 billion from $10.19 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 5.8 percent.
Sales at its 800 Sears stores were strong in both the hard lines, such as home electronics and exercise equipment, and the soft lines, including apparel and cosmetics. Sears said sales were also strong in its 1,200 stores outside of malls, which include Homelife furniture and Sears hardware.
Sears's strong sales and earnings come as other retailers have struggled to gain sales from consumers worried about their job security and the economy. Still, Sears posted a healthy 6.8 percent increase in December's same-store sales.
"Sears was one of the few that had a good Christmas," said Joseph Ronning, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
Its January same-store sales, which will be reported today, are expected to rise about 2 percent, dragged down by severe winter weather throughout the month. Even that small increase is better than what is expected for many of its competitors.
Analysts credited Sears's recent successes to a revamping by the chairman and chief executive, Arthur Martinez, who joined the retailer three years ago and took his current post in August.

Japan Trade and German Report Help Dollar vs. Yen and Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most major currencies yesterday on the strength of improved trade numbers with Japan and a newspaper report that the German Government was about to report higher unemployment figures.
The dollar's rise against the Japanese yen came on the back of a United States report that showed the trade deficit with Japan dropped in November to its lowest level since May 1993. Figures issued in Japan earlier in the day showed its overall trade surplus narrowed last year. 
 Traders pushed the dollar higher against the German mark on new speculation that Germany would have to lower interest rates to spur its economy. Lower rates devalue a country's assets and currency.
"The fears about Germany not easing have been almost completely unwound because of the unemployment report," said John Rothfield, an international economist at the Chicago office of Nationsbanc-CRT.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar was trading at 1.4770 marks, compared with 1.4710 marks on Tuesday. It finished at 106.10 yen, up from 105.20 yen the day before. The British pound slipped to $1.5368 from $1.5415.
The dollar began its rise against the yen as the Japanese Government announced that its trade surplus in goods and services fell 15 percent in 1995, the second straight annual decline. Later, the Commerce Department reported that the United States deficit with Japan had dropped.
That led traders to realize that the United States trade imbalance with Japan, a sore point between the two countries, "would not be with us forever," Mr. Rothfield said.
The improved trade numbers were seen as a sign of encouragement that Japanese policy to weaken the yen by cutting the trade imbalance was working.
In Germany, a newspaper reported that the Government would announce today that unemployment jumped to 10.8 percent in January, from 9.9 percent in December.
The numbers show "that the German economy really stopped in the second half of last year," Mr. Rothfield of Nationsbank-CRT said. The dollar will benefit, he said, now that the Bundesbank "has a vested interest for the dollar to go higher," particularly through continued interest rate cuts.

HEADLINE: Belgrade Journal;
Scathing 'Conscience' of Balkans Spares No One

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia

 BODY:
During the Balkan war, most artists and writers in what was once Yugoslavia used their talents to glorify the ideologies that fuel violence or have found themselves silenced.
But amid the cacophony there has been one artist with enough stature in all six republics of the former Yugoslavia to continue to ridicule the nationalism and triumphalism that comes out of Belgrade, Zagreb and Sarajevo. 
 Dusan Kovacevic, a quiet, reclusive figure, was Yugoslavia's best-known playwright and screenwriter before the war. One of his plays, "The Professional," which has been running in Belgrade since 1989, was staged by Circle Repertory Company in New York last year and his film "Underground" won the Palme d'Or at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. Within the former Yugoslavia his movies have achieved cult status. And the often cynical new generation, which has paid in blood for the nationalist dreams of its leaders, recites lines from his work like mantras.
"Don't let them kill you until we've won," taken from the play "Radovan III," is, like dozens of other lines, part of the vocabulary here.
"He has become our conscience," said Boba Durovic, a leading Belgrade theater director, "although there are a lot of people who would rather not listen."
Mr. Kovacevic sat on the edge of a couch, smoking a cigarette, in a small coffee shop in downtown Belgrade recently. He rarely appears in public, remaining at home with his wife, who is a lawyer, and two children.
"Look across the whole of the former Yugoslavia," he said sadly, "and all you see are works that glorify the nationalist ideologies that have crept up. There has been a terrible corruption of the arts. It reminds me of the Communist rule under Tito. We filmed some 800 movies in the old Yugoslavia after the end of World War II and about 500 of them were about the war. Not a single one was any good. We made stupid movies for 50 years.
"It is happening all over again, only now we have six states producing them. War is a great opportunity for mediocre writers and artists. Art cannot be motivated by hate."
Mr. Kovacevic, a 47-year-old Serb, began exploring the violent and self-destructive nature of his society long before it burst onto the world's television screens four years ago. "Radovan III," for example, focuses on a character who is so obsessed with the destruction of his enemies that he ultimately destroys himself.
In "The Professional," his 12th play, he strikes this familiar theme. The two main characters are divided by age, ideology, ethnicity and social circumstances. Teya was a dissident who is now flourishing with the collapse of Communism. Luke, a former secret policeman who spied on Teya, has had to deal with the destruction of a world that gave him meaning. He now drives a cab. The two are drawn together by their past relationship, although the men have changed roles. The oppressed has become the oppressor, and the new power structure is as corrupt and immoral as the old.
Like Louis-Ferdinand Celine and Edward Albee, Mr. Kovacevic insists on plumbing the depths of human despair and depravity with black humor. It is humor, he says, that best points out the incongruity of a people living in economic and political decline but clutching at fantastic myths of past glory and achievement.
He rarely raises political themes directly, writing instead about the intimate relationships between individuals.
"The war that never ends is the war between the parent and the child, the father and the son," he said. "The only solution is love and compassion. In our families we have fought too often over ideologies. Private wars have led to real wars. This is our fate."
Mr. Kovacevic is fascinated with the powerful criminal underworld that has risen from the wreckage of Communism across Eastern Europe and in Russia. He is now working on a play about the gangsters who he says control the theaters, along with nearly everything else, in Serbia. He describes Belgrade as "like Chicago in the days of Al Capone."
"In Belgrade we have a better class of criminal than we do artist," he said. "We suffer from primitive capitalism and this means we also suffer from primitive art. It all reminds me of Woody Allen's 'Bullets Over Broadway,' where petty mobsters have been handed the control of everything from our factories to our cultural life."
"Power has not changed that much," he went on. "The old Communist bosses are now the new capitalist managers. These old bosses just work for Mafia dons instead of the party."
Although he is a practicing member of the Eastern Orthodox Church, he has a deep distrust of authority. And he worries that Serbs, Croats and Muslims in the former Yugoslavia have embraced a pattern of self-destruction that, if left unexamined, will lead again to bloodshed. He says the NATO-led troops deployed to separate the rival factions in Bosnia will have to stay 20 years if they want to prevent another war.
"The main theme of all of my work is the insecurity of the individual before the system," he said. "It does not matter what the system is called, what ideology it embraces, the distortion done to the individual, the violence carried out by the system against the individual, is always the same and so is the result."

HEADLINE: North Korea Tells Groups To Halt Drive For Flood Aid

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Retreating from a landmark policy decision to seek international assistance, North Korea has told foreign relief agencies not to organize new appeals for flood victims who by some accounts are on the verge of famine.
Relief officials in New York, Geneva and elsewhere say they believe that conditions in the North Korean countryside remain desperate. But they have set aside plans for new appeals, while hoping that North Korea will reconsider. 
 North Korea's Foreign Ministry blamed army leaders in part for the change in policy, the relief officials said. Deputy Foreign Minister Choe Su Hon reportedly explained that some military leaders had opposed the policy decision, made last year, to seek outside help, and that these critics had capitalized on the problems that arose in the attempt to open the country.
The request for aid last year was an extraordinary step for North Korea, and an acknowledgement of its economic problems. The appeal was widely regarded as a milestone in the effort to ease North Korea's isolation in international affairs.
It is unclear whether the decision marks a complete reversal of policy, or something much milder, and the North Korean Government has not clarified its position.
"We just have to wait and see," said Simon Missiri, deputy director of the Asia-Pacific Department of the International Federation of the Red Cross in Geneva. "One way or another, aid has to come. Otherwise, there will be a big crisis for sure."
A United Nations official in New York said, "They haven't completely closed the door." North Korean diplomats at the United Nations in New York and Geneva did not rule out resuming aid later in the year.
The North Korean Foreign Ministry suggested to the aid organizations, however, that if they do not now have assistance in the pipeline, they might as well go home.
If the change in policy proves to be a lasting one, it is likely to lead to a further increase in nervousness along the heavily-armed border between North and South Korea. Tension is already higher this winter, partly because North Korea moved some fighters and bombers closer to the frontier. Any sign that North Korea is retreating into greater isolation or that its army is gaining influence will add to fears in the south.
The first hint of the latest development came on Friday in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. Mr. Choe addressed the heads of a half-dozen relief groups, reportedly going out of his way to express gratitude for the aid. But he noted that North Korea has said that although last year's floods caused $5 billion damage, the United Nations opened a $15 million appeal and raised only $5 million.
In an unusual acknowledgment of splits within the North Korean Government -- and one of several references to the army -- Mr. Choe reportedly said that the decision to ask for aid had been a very difficult one, achieved over military objections. He said that problems also had been seized upon by forces both within North Korea, which he identified as the army, and outside the country, by which he apparently meant South Korea.
Mr. Choe emphasized that North Korea would continue to accept aid already in the works -- including, although he did not mention it, a $2 million package from Washington.
Washington agreed to give the assistance to North Korea, with which it does not have diplomatic relations, after recent consultations with Japan and South Korea. Both are irritated that North Korea seemed ungrateful for food assistance sent last year, and said that they would not give further aid.
The significance of Mr. Choe's references to military hard-liners, which echo similar comments made by other officials, is unclear. Many experts believe that the army may indeed be taking a tougher line, but Foreign Ministry officials would not mention the split unless they had approval from those same hard-liners in the military leadership.
Thus it may be that the Government is in part using a good cop-bad cop approach as a way of explaining its twists and turns of policy, officials and scholars say.
Over the past year, North Korea has been unusually accommodating to relief agencies, allowing them unprecedented access to rural areas and to information. Based on what their staff members have seen, the agencies are unanimous in saying that the shortage of food is extremely serious and that North Korea risks a major famine later this year.
The latest reports indicate that for the first time schools have no heat or electricity this winter, and that because of sub-freezing temperatures, schools were closed throughout the country for January. Schools have reopened, but are still unheated and attendance is said to be down 20 to 30 percent because of sickness.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues End Day Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended mixed yesterday, as the market showed its disappointment with a sale of new 10-year notes.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 13/32 , to 10924/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.15 percent, from 6.12 percent on Tuesday 
 The sale of the 10-year notes was the second leg of the Treasury's three-part, $44.5 billion quarterly refunding. Although the $14 billion offering was sold near expectations, bids at the auction were a little softer than expected and retail interest was thin.
The average yield at auction for the 10-year note was 5.649 percent, down from 5.9 percent in November and the lowest yield on record.
"Typically one out of three auctions goes poorly, said Doug Burtnick, a managing analyst at Technical Data, a market research and analysis firm in Boston, "and it seems that the 10's were the refunding's sacrificial lamb."
As a result, market participants said yesterday that they expected that securities dealers might have to make additional yield concessions for today's auction of $12 billion in new 30-year bonds.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the long bond was being offered at a price to yield 6.09 percent, up about three-hundredths of a percentage point from the previous trading day.
Gary Thayer, senior economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, said while yields were at historic lows, they were not as attactive to investors as they would like.
He said that while the auction of 10-year notes was not a disaster, the soft demand raised concern in the market.
In addition to the long bond, the Treasury plans to sell $8 billion in seven-day cash management bills.
Bond prices received some support yesterday from the third consecutive decline in gold prices, whose recent rally had troubled the Treasury market over the last week. Surging gold prices are typically an indicator of inflationary pressures, and while supply and demand factors had been behind the metal's rally, the rise still disturbed many market participants. Yesterday, gold for April delivery fell $3.20, to $411.40 an ounce at the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, its largest one-day drop since Nov. 22.
Economic news is sparse this week, and the only reports out yesterday were the November trade deficit report, which showed the nation's trade gap narrowing by 13.5 percent.
Imports fell seven-tenths of 1 percent and exports rose nine-tenths of 1 percent. The trade deficit with Japan shrank to $4.13 billion, lowest since $3.7 billion in May 1993.
Consumer credit for December came in near expectations, economists said, with borrowing rising by $7.9 billion but at a slower pace.
Today, the market will get a look at initial weekly jobless claims for the period ended Jan. 27. Analysts expect the numbers to be off slightly to 385,000, from 388,000.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 10-year notes:
