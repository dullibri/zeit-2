HEADLINE: Why South Africa Has to Privatize Now

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A great disservice to public understanding of South Africa's economic situation is done by Adam Hochschild's article on privatization in South Africa ("A Fire Sale in South Africa," Op-Ed, Nov. 2).
The motive behind privatization, be it in England, the Soviet Union or South Africa, is to encourage efficiency and economic growth, and to disengage the state from activities not central to government's essential responsibilities, i.e., administration of justice, public safety, foreign affairs. Mr. Hochschild would keep these enterprises in the hands of the state to facilitate affirmative action four or five years from now. He ignores that the South African economy desperately needs the revitalization privatization can assist. Even more disturbing, he forgets that the economy is the economy that will serve all South Africans, black or white. It will serve them well if it is healthy and growing, badly if it stagnates.
The South African economy has been stagnant for years and will probably grow less than .5 percent this year, while population growth continues at 2.4 percent and unemployment is at 15 percent. As the country looks forward to majority rule, it will need not only to create employment, but also to equalize per capita expenditures in health, education, welfare and housing. It also needs to begin land redistribution with fair compensation, and with financing for the purchasers. Both programs involve massive funds. The only significant budgetary offset will be a reduction in military expenditures. Increased taxation will be a very limited source of funds for a country seeking a dramatic increase in economic growth.
President F. W. de Klerk's mandate expires in 1994, when a majority elected government is expected to come in. South Africa cannot wait four years to liberalize an economy that has nearly stopped growing. Liberalization must go ahead full speed. Also, the world's economic powers should study massive economic aid for South Africa, because in the short run the country cannot generate the wealth to meet the growing but reasonable expectations of its population. Mr. Hochschild's assumptions obscure this, and so does the equally incorrect assumption that removing sanctions will revitalize the South African economy.

HEADLINE: Albanian Exile Writer Sees Reform

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Ismail Kadare, the pre-eminent writer of Albania, says he sought refuge in France a month ago because of "the conviction that more than any action I could take in Albania, my defection would help the democratization of my country."
Albania is Europe's last Communist-ruled country, and Mr. Kadare, whose novels and poems have been published in about a million copies, has been a national figure there comparable in popularity perhaps to Mark Twain in the United States. His works have been translated into 15 languages. 
 In response to written questions, the 54-year-old author, in his first interview since defecting, said he had been subjected to "threats from the Sigurimi," Albania's ubiquitous secret police. This, together with his disappointment over the Government's rough handling of some 5,000 asylum seekers at foreign embassies in Tirana last summer, prompted him to leave, he said.
"In the case of democratic processes in Albania, the pace of change is a matter of life and death," he said, referring to President Ramiz Alia's seventh-month-old program of cautious political and economic change. "If I had any doubt that accelerating such processes would cause unrest and anarchy and thus hurt the Albanian nation, I would never raise this issue. But I am convinced the contrary is true. I am convinced that a delay in this direction will be fatal."
 
Sees End of Dictatorship
 He also said he was "deeply convinced" that despite more than four decades of Stalinist rule, the 3.3 million people of Albania would be able to shake off dictatorship.
"This is a people with a rich internal resource," he said, "a strong tradition and a great sense of justice. The Albanian people will be able to take the right step in these difficult times. The evil has not penetrated this country to the extent it is commonly thought."
Like other literary works created under a Communist dictatorship, Mr. Kadare's writing may be read in different ways and on different levels. He has, in the words of Arshi Pipa, an Albanian-American critic, "a double-entendre way of writing, allusive and analogical and often allegoric, punctuated by insinuating hints."
Mr. Kadare has been as much a source of controversy at home as he is in literary circles abroad. His novels and verses both criticized and praised the regime of Enver Hoxha, the Communist tyrant who died in 1985. For instance, his "Chronicle in Stone," published in 1971, portrays life in Gjirokaster, where both he and Mr. Hoxha were born, in a series of sketches. Some of these obliquely cast Mr. Hoxha in a lurid light.
But in "The Great Winter," a novel about Albania's break with the Soviet Union in 1960, Mr. Kadare depicts Mr. Hoxha as a national hero for defying Nikita S. Khrushchev, the Soviet leader at the time, as he had also done in a long poem called "The Sixties."
 
No Repudiation
 Asked whether he might revise his views of the Hoxha era, which lasted 40 years, Mr. Kadare replied: "There is no need for me to change. Moreover, I will never repudiate what I have written. I have no intention of throwing mud on some 50 years in the life of my people."
He denied that he had enjoyed the protection of Mr. Hoxha, saying: "For 20 years they have attacked me continually. Do you believe that someone in Albania could have been attacked especially in such a harsh manner, if he had the real protection of Enver Hoxha?"
The writer said that if anyone had protected him, it was "the entire Albanian nation" by its overwhelming approval of his works. Indeed, there is hardly an Albanian household without a Kadare book, and even foreign visitors are presented with volumes of his verse as souvenirs. "Had it been up to dogmatic officials, my work would have been buried a long time ago," he said.
He mentioned an incident in 1975 when he had submitted a poem called "Red Pashas" attacking the Communist bureaucracy. Saying the poem amounted to a call for an uprising, the party bureaucracy prevented its publication, forced Mr. Kadare to express self-criticism and barred him from publishing for a time. "No one came to my defense," he said.
Earlier this year, he said, the secret police had fabricated statements charging that he had condemned the Tirana asylum-seekers. He called this "a cynical lie."
"The final thrust," he continued, "was the direct or indirect threats from the Sigurimi, which wanted to settle old scores. The Sigurimi would have used the first signs of unrest to settle those scores."
 
Police Arrest List Reported
 Mr. Kadare was alluding here to a purported list of about 100 Albanian intellectuals to be arrested by the security police. The existence of the list was rumored in Tirana last spring and summer as an apparent attempt to intimidate the intellectuals. The author was reportedly on this list.
Mr. Kadare acknowledged that he had met and discussed his views on Albania's future with President Alia -- most recently in August -- and that, "although my dialogue with him has been interrupted, I still believe one can talk to and have a dialogue with him."
He also said it was evident that the Alia regime was not as harsh as that of Mr. Hoxha's. "The regime in the current phase is much less dictatorial," he said.
The author had already been in France for several weeks when he announced that he was seeking political asylum on Oct. 25. Some 28 hours passed before the official Albanian press agency issued a brief statement on "this ugly act," saying Mr. Kadare had placed himself "in the services of the enemies of Albania."
In the interview, Mr. Kadare said: "Dogmatic officials have always done things like this. Those who are so vigilant to protect a criminal and enemy of Albania, like Stalin, are ready to reject, even with pleasure, national values. But it is now too late. Their time is running out."
 
Other Writers React
 The immediate reactions from leading Tirana writers mixed regret with friendship and admiration for Mr. Kadare. "I continue to have great respect for his work," said Dritero Agolli, a poet who heads the Albanian Writers' Union.
"I feel abandoned." Nezhat Tozaj, a novelist, commented. "I am still his friend."
Since his defection, Mr. Kadare has remained in seclusion, his whereabouts kept confidential by his Paris publisher. The interview questions were transmitted to him in French through the publisher. His responses were provided in Albanian two weeks later.
He said his defection was "inadvertently" prefigured last spring in a poem titled "Insufficient Time," his last to be published in Albania. In it he speaks of approaching his grave, and he said in the interview, "Departure from this world has been identified with fleeing the motherland."
The final stanza is:
Tormented until the last moment
By the silence and by being a tragic hostage
Perhaps with an incomprehensible signal
I will take leave of all and escape.

HEADLINE: William Hall Wendel Dies at 76; Former Head of Kennecott Copper

BYLINE: By ALFONSO A. NARVAEZ

 BODY:
William Hall Wendel, the retired president of the Carborundum Company and the Kennecott Copper Corporation, died on Monday at his winter home in Savannah, Ga. He was 76 years old and lived in Savannah and Buffalo.
He died of a heart attack, a spokesman for the family said.
Mr. Wendel joined Carborundum as an assistant to the president in 1947 after serving with the Army and Navy Munitions Board, the War Productions Board and as an assistant to the president of United Engineering Company. 
 In 1948 he was promoted to manager of the coated products division. He was named executive vice president in 1959 and president in 1962, and directed the company through its greatest period of growth, including 10 major acquisitions.
In 1977 Carborundum was sold to the Kennecott Copper Corporation for about $560 million, and Mr. Wendel became president of Kennecott, which has since been acquired by Standard Oil (Ohio). He stepped down in 1980. In retirement, he served for five years as chairman of Polaris Industries, a Minneapolis company he and others acquired. It manufactures all-terrain vehicles and other transportation equipment.
 
Promoted Niagara Area
 Mr. Wendel was a leading spokesman for the economic, cultural and social concerns in the Buffalo-Niagara Falls area. He helped found the Society for the Promotion, Unification and Redevelopment of Niagara, an organization to spur business development in the area.
He worked to rebuild the city of Niagara Falls and was responsible for the construction of a $4.5 million downtown headquarters for Carborundum. He also served on the board of the Roger Tory Peterson Institute, which preserves bird sanctuaries, and on the boards of Allegheny International, the Dunlop Tire & Rubber Corporation, the Energy Reserves Group, the New York Telephone Company and the Norfolk & Western Railway Company.
Mr. Wendel graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1936 and the Harvard Business School in 1940. He was a member of the American Society of Corporate Executives, a commissioner of the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, and chairman of the State University of New York College of Environmental Sciences and Forestry at Syracuse.
He is survived by his wife, Louise; two sons, William Jr. and Jeffrey, both of Minneapolis; a daughter, Christine Longyear of Baltimore, and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Australian to Become Head of BTR of Britain

BYLINE: By Marion Underhill

 BODY:
BTR P.L.C., the British conglomerate, has named Alan Jackson as managing director and chief executive, effective Jan. 1. Mr. Jackson, a 54-year-old Australian, succeeds John C. Cahill, who steps down at the company's retirement age of 60.
Mr. Jackson joined the BTR group in 1977 as managing director of what became BTR Nylex Ltd., one of Australia's most dynamic international companies, which is 62 percent owned by BTR. After a period of development and local acquisitions, BTR Nylex expanded in the 1980's by acquiring large international enterprises, including the China General Plastics Corporation of Taiwan, ACI International Ltd. of Australia and Feltrax of New Zealand. 
 BTR P.L.C. is a London-based global corporation comprising more than 500 companies operating in five business sectors: industrial, control systems and electrical, construction, transportation and consumer.
In April, the company began a $1.64 billion hostile bid for the Norton Company, the abrasives group in Worcester, Mass., but lost out to Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, the French glass manufacturer, which topped the offer at almost $2 billion. A month later, BTR said its wholly owned subsidiary, the Schlegel Corporation in Rochester, had agreed to buy the United Technologies Corporation's Global Automotive Sealing Systems group for approximately $200 million cash.
Commenting on the appointment, Sir Owen Green, BTR's chairman, said: "Alan Jackson has an outstanding record, evidenced by the dramatic growth of BTR Nylex over the past 13 years. He now takes on the most challenging role within our group, following the sterling achievements of John Cahill."
Mr. Jackson is married with four daughters. He is a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia and an active contributor to the Economic Planning Advisory Council of Australia. He was voted Australia's Businessman of the Year in 1985 and 1989.

HEADLINE: FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;
New York State Offering Pollution-Control Bonds

 BODY:
The New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation is offering $68.1 million in tax-exempt revenue bonds to finance water-pollution-control projects. The offering is through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The maximum yield is 7.20 percent for an issue due 2011. Shorter maturities offer yields ranging from 5.45 percent for securities due in 1991 to 6.05 percent in 1995, 6.55 percent in 2000 and 6.90 percent in 2004.
Underwriters said the financing was rated Aa by Moody's Investors Service and A+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Money from the bonds will provide low-interest loans to eight municipalities in the state to finance pollution-control projects through the state revolving-fund program.
Three of the loans will finance new construction, four will refinance continuing projects and one will be used for both new construction and refinancing. The Governor's office said the loans would save the municipalities more than $15 million in interest costs, helping to hold down their charges for sewer service.
The state agency selects the municipalities based on a rating system that gives priority to projects that address the most pressing needs.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls on Indications That War Tension Is Easing

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell on world currency markets yesterday as the prospects for war dimmed after the offer by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to release all foreigners detained in Iraq and Kuwait.
The market interpreted his offer "as a sign war tensions were easing, and the dollar fell sharply," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the firm IDEA. The dollar is typically viewed as an investment haven during world turmoil. 
 But as the session wore on, Mr. Chandler said it became clearer to traders that Saddam Hussein was actually prepared for war and made the offer because his troops were now fully deployed in Kuwait. That assessment helped the dollar firm a bit around midday, but it then languished for the remainder of the session.
"The market was supporting the dollar on a war premium and took it down on a peace premium," said Michael Malpede, a senior analyst at Refco Group Ltd. in Chicago.
Also putting pressure on the dollar was anticipation over the release today of November unemployment data. Analysts expect the Labor Department report will show an increase in initial jobless claims and a higher overall unemployment rate for the month.
"That will further confirm the slowdown of the U.S. economy and add pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates," Mr. Chandler said. Lower interest rates erode the value of dollar-denominated securities and therefore decrease investors' need for the United States currency.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 134.05 Japanese yen, from 133.42 yen on Wednesday. Later in London, it fell to 132.35 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 132.14 yen, down from 133.63 yen on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.9390, from $1.9225 late Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.9400 to buy one pound, more expensive than Wednesday's $1.9260.
Against the German currency, the dollar fell to 1.4885 marks, from 1.4993 on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.2710 Swiss francs, down from 1.2795; 5.0510 French francs, down from 5.0770; 1,122.25 Italian lire, down from 1,127.68, and 1.1621 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1630.
Silver prices showed a decline. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.121 a troy ounce, down from $4.148 on Wednesday. In London silver was unchanged at a late bid price of $4.16 a troy ounce.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
'Phantom Income' Created by Swaps

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
JUST when "junk bond" investors might have thought things could get no worse, Congress has voted to raise taxes on companies that issue such high-yield bonds and get into trouble.
The new law threatens to force companies, and in some cases bondholders, to pay taxes on "phantom income" created when troubled companies restructure their debt to survive. 
 Depending on how the Internal Revenue Service interprets the law, it could mean the death of the public junk bond market by offering companies a big tax advantage if they keep their bonds out of the public market.
The law will be most severe on companies that try to restructure their bonds without going into bankruptcy court. Those that seek Chapter 11 protection from their creditors can escape the law's most severe restrictions, but they face a provision that reduces the flexibility of choosing bankruptcy.
In essence, the law changes the tax treatment when companies swap new securities for old bonds. Those swaps are typically made by companies that are in financial distress and cannot meet the terms of their old obligations. Under the old law, it was easy for the company in question to avoid paying tax on the phantom income that was, in effect, generated when a loan was forgiven. Under the new law, that will remain the case only if the bonds in question are not publicly traded; if they are, much harsher rules will apply.
"Congress has imposed a tax on the theoretical income of companies which have fallen on hard times," said Joni L. Nelson, a partner in the New York law firm of Rogers & Wells. "This blow to restructuring seems particularly inappropriate foran economy on the precipice of recession."
The new law "really is biased in favor of non-publicly traded situations," said Robert Willens, an accountant and tax analyst at Lehman Brothers. He said many on Wall Street hoped the I.R.S. would impose a strict and restrictive definition of publicly traded, confining the category to bonds traded on an exchange, not to bonds traded over the counter with prices quoted on what are known in the trade as yellow sheets.
But if a broader definition is established, the result could be to force many companies to remove the bonds from the public market altogether by no longer filing information with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That step could save taxes, but at the cost of depriving investors information and possibly making it harder for current bondholders to find buyers for their bonds.
The new law, which took effect on Oct. 7 but did not cover exchange offers under way then, can be most easily viewed through an example of a troubled company that originally sold a publicly traded $1,000 bond at face value, with a coupon of perhaps 16 percent. Suppose the company reaches an agreement with bondholders to exchange that bond for a similar one with an interest rate of 12 percent, and with most of those interest payments deferred. The new bond begins trading at $700.
Under the old law, there would have been no tax effect. But under the new law, Mr. Willens said, the company would owe tax immediately on the $300 "profit." If the company has sufficient losses tooffset that gain, it will not have any immediate tax to pay, but that phantom profit will effectively reduce the operating earnings that can be sheltered from taxes by loss carry-forwards.
Over the life of the bonds, the company may be able to recoup that $300 through deductions from taxable income, but those tax effects will be delayed. And to add insult to injury, the holder of the bonds, like an individual or a junk bond mutual fund, will have to report phantom income each year totaling $300 over the life of the bond.
That is the treatment if the company's bonds are publicly traded. But if they are not, and there is no trading price, the I.R.S. will assume the bond is worth face value, so long as the new bond has an interest rate at least as high as Treasury rates, now below 9 percent. The result is that a company with publicly traded bonds would pay taxes on phantom income, whereas an identical company with bonds that are not publicly traded would not.
Bond swaps in bankruptcy proceedings have always been exempt from taxation, so long as a significant amount of stock was included in the package. The new law changes that by saying that certain types of preferred stock -- those with a specified maturity price and a required redemption date -- do not qualify as stock for that purpose. The result is likely to be that different kinds of stock will be used in restructurings, with more reliance on common stock.
Nonetheless, the bankruptcy exception will remain. In the earlier example, where a bond worth $700 was issued in exchange for a bond that had cost $1,000, there would be no tax penalty for the company if stock that had more than a "nominal" value was included in the package. That term has never been exactly defined, but the I.R.S. said yesterday that it was considering a rule that would require the stock to be worth at least one-tenth of the value of the debt being canceled.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A 'Happy Ending' In Gulf Is Doubted

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE greatest uncertainty hanging over the economy and the financial markets is whether the confrontation in the Persian Gulf will end in war or peace. Markets got a shot in the arm this week when President Saddam Hussein of Iraq accepted President Bush's proposal for discussions in Washington and Baghdad with their respective chief foreign officers. And yesterday word came that Mr. Hussein said he would allow all hostages to leave Iraq and Kuwait.
However, the end game of this affair is tricky -- and could take a lot longer than the Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations resolutions calling for full Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, restoration of the Kuwaiti Government and release of all hostages. President Hussein will doubtless seek to escape from some of those terms. 
 President Bush said he was not convinced that Mr. Hussein had yet got the message from the U.N. that "all means" would be used against him if he did not get out. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said that as a "reward" for full Iraqi withdrawal and release of all hostages, the United States was prepared to offer assurances that it would not take military action.
Does all this mean that peace is about to break out? Not necessarily. A high-ranking Western diplomat, just back from discussions in Iraq, said in a not-for-attribution interview this week that he still thought the resolution of the crisis would be by war. He said President Hussein, in his talks with Mr. Baker, might agree to full withdrawal from Kuwait and release of all the hostages -- but that he would delay and delay, offering one pretext after another, while holding on to parts of Kuwait and to some hostages. In the end, he said, warwould come. Similarly, Robert D. Hormats, a former State Department official and now vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, said this week that "the probability of war is increasing" because "Saddam Hussein thinks President Bush does not have the support of the United States people on a commitment to war." Mr. Hussein's belief in American irresolution could force the United States into war.
What Mr. Hormats fears most is the so-called 80 percent solution, with Mr. Hussein giving up 80 percent of Kuwait and keeping the other 20 percent -- including oilfields, two islands, and "the knowledge that he had stood the United States down." Such a "solution," Mr. Hormats said, "could be worse than war," since it would cause the coalition to fragment and would leave Iraq in a position to earn enormous profits from oil, which it would use to buy advanced military technology, dominate the gulf and become a far more dangerous enemy. With Mr. Hussein's instructions to his parliament to release all hostages, the 80 percent solution looks even more probable as his basic ploy.
If war comes, will it be quick or protracted?Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist of the Midland Bank in New York, said the Bush Administration was counting on a quick solution that would bring oil prices back to pre-crisis levels, raise consumer confidence and stimulate economic recovery.
"They have blamed the Middle East situation as the key factor causing the present economic downturn and are stressing that the resolution of the Middle East crisis will be the principal salvation for the economy," he said. Mr. Fabbri considers this a falsely optimistic view and contends that "the massive financial problems of the economy must be worked out before a meaningful expansion can emerge."
Most oil experts believe, as Charles L. Schultze of the Brookings Institution said this week, that if war broke out and ended quickly it would temporarily raise oil prices sharply and depress financial markets, but "sustained disruptions to oil supplies would not occur."
Oil prices would then fall back below today's levels, and financial markets would soon recover, Mr. Schultze said. But two "low probability" outcomes, he added, might confound the experts and disrupt this rather optimistic assessment: first, a long-lasting, high-intensity war and, second, substantial damage by the Iraqis of oil installations in the gulf.
The talks with Iraq may well give a lift to spirits, and markets, in coming weeks. But a true resolution of the conflict may remain out of reach. The tougher the United States stance, the greater the hope of a lasting settlement. But the chances of miscalculation are great.
At this point, as Prof. M. A. Adelman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology observes, it is hard to envision a "happy ending," for if President Hussein goes before his people as a "discredited C.E.O. with two big, failed investments, Iran and Kuwait," he himself may be liquidated. But if he escapes with some gains in the gulf, he will live to make even bigger trouble another day.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Securities Ease

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dipped slightly, and interest rates moved up a bit in light trading yesterday, as dealers awaited this morning's release of November employment data.
"It's a very quiet market," said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. "Caution and profit taking are the watchwords of the day. The market has come a long way, and there is a big number on Friday. At this point people are unwilling to make purchases." 
 Most economists are expecting the employment numbers will show that economic conditions deteriorated further last month. A sharp decline in non-farm payroll employment and a fairly sizable increase in the unemployment rate are anticipated.
A survey of economists about the employment report by MMS International, an economic information service company, shows that most are projecting a decline of 75,000 in nonfarm payroll employment and a rise in the unemployment rate to 5.9 percent, from 5.7 percent in October.
"The employment numbers will be important," said Michael R. Englund, a vice president and director of research at MMS, "but a lot will hinge on what happens in the Middle East. If there was a significant move in Iraq, that would likely overshadow the employment report."
Mr. Englund and others said that a news report stating that a news conference had been scheduled by Iraq for early this morning accentuated the possibility that additional important news might be forthcoming.
 
Gulf Report Affects Oil
 Reports that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq may release the remaining hostages held in Iraq helped push oil prices lower yesterday, sending prices of fixed-income securities up at first. But later in the session prices in the credit markets fell back.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered in late trading at a price of 104 19/32, down 6/32, to yield 8.32 percent, compared with 8.31 percent late Wednesday.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 7/ 32, down 1/8 point, to yield 8.16 percent. And the 7 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 26/32, down 1/32, to yield 7.47 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates rose slightly.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.99 percent, up one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point. And six-month bill rates rose by three basis points, to a late offered rate of 6.87 percent.
New issuance remained strong in the investment-grade corporate bond market yesterday, as five companies offered a total of $875 million worth of securities.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade bonds said that the heavy flow of new securities over the last few weeks was having a salutary effect on the overall market.
"We are getting a reprieve from all the nervousness that has been in the market," one corporate bond trader said.
He said that prices of a General Motors 10-year issue that was priced on Wednesday at $100, or par, improved by about half a point yesterday. Bonds issued by major commercial banks also rose in price.
In general, traders said that prices of most intermediate-term corporate issues rose by about1/8 point, while longer-dated securities slipped by about 1/4 point.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt bonds, prices of most widely quoted issues fell by 1/4 point to 1/2 point, dealers said.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Nov. 26.
The money report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: Gephardt Says G.O.P. Trades on Racial Divisions

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, accused Republican strategists today of "following a new trail of racial resentment" and seeking political gain by dividing whites and blacks over the issue of affirmative action.
In a strikingly partisan speech that set out lines of attack for the new Democratic Congress, Mr. Gephardt also scoffed at the notion, advanced by some Republicans, of a "new paradigm" for Federal programs. Advocates of the "new paradigm" describe it as a new approach to government that emphasizes less bureaucracy, more individual choice and the operation of free market forces. 
 Mr. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, suggested that it was simply a Republican dodge. "David Stockman admitted that the supply-side economics of the 1980's was nothing more than a Trojan Horse for the old, discredited trickle-down theory," Mr. Gephardt said, alluding to President Ronald Reagan's first budget director.
 
'A Trojan Polo Pony'
 "By that standard, the New Paradigm may be nothing more than a Trojan polo pony, providing attractive cover for yet another assault on working families and another giveaway for the privileged," he asserted in an address before the Center for National Policy, a Democratic-oriented policy group in Washington.
Mr. Gephardt, who sought the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1988 and who is mentioned as a potential future contender, has often helped frame the Democratic debate in recent months and notably in last fall's budget negotiations.
He delivered a biting counterattack on quotas, an issue that many Democrats assert is being used by Republicans to polarize the races and peel white voters away from the Democrats. The next chairman of the Republican National Committee, William J. Bennett, has said that quotas were worthy of debate and he has defended the use of the issue by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina in his successful campaign against Harvey Gantt, a Democrat who was the first black mayor of Charlotte.
In that race, a Helms campaign advertisement showed white hands crumpling a rejection letter while an announcer declared, "You needed that job, and you were the best qualified. But they had to give it to a minority because of a racial quota." The commercial echoed a charge by Republicans that the civil rights bill vetoed by President Bush this year would have led to the adoption of quotas by employers.
"The ideologues on the right are following a new trail of racial resentment and recrimination blazed by David Duke, then trod successfully by Jesse Helms, and now given a tarnished patina of intellectual respectability by William Bennett," Mr. Gephardt said, alluding to the politics of Mr. Duke, the Louisiana State Representative who is a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan.
 
Some Are Said to Seek Divisions
 Mr. Gephardt, noting that many "conscientious Republicans" supported the civil rights bill, asserted that "certain Republican strategists seek to divide white working people from black working people, and thereby distract them from their common interests and concerns: that under Republican rule, the system works for the rich, but not for them."
Mr. Gephardt repeated the Democrats' stated intent to move quickly on the civil rights bill when the 102d Congress convenes in January.
Charles Black, chief spokesman for the Republican National Committee, today countered, "The whole theme he's representing is nonsense, and it's a cheap shot to inject David Duke into this debate since David Duke is out of the mainstream and has been vigorously opposed by Republicans and Democrats."
Mr. Black added, "It's obvious that Congressman Gephardt is hiding from discussing the merits of this issue. The President wants a civil rights bill. The Democrats want a quota bill."

HEADLINE: Slow Start For Holiday Retail Sales

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
The Christmas shopping season that began last month started off more slowly than last year's, bearing out pessimistic forecasts for the holiday period as a whole, according to reports yesterday from a number of the nation's leading retailers.
The downtrend is most evident at stores that have been open at least a year, a measure considered more important than sales including new stores. 
 Retailers with a wide variety of merchandise and price levels generally reported declines in November from the level a year earlier by the "same store" measure. Among them were Sears, J. C. Penney, May Department Stores, Neiman Marcus, Venture, Carter Hawley Hale and Mercantile Stores.
 
An Important Month
 November is an important month in retailers' calendars, traditionally ranking second only to December. In women's apparel, for example, December's share of yearly sales is 13.9 percent and November's is 9.3 percent, according to the National Retail Federation.
The disappointing sales results added another indication that the nation was in a recession.
"The overriding issue in the retail business is the economy," said Janet Mangano, research director at Jesup, Josephthal & Company in New York. "People's jobs are less secure and income isn't rising as much."
The buying malaise seemed to spread across department stores, specialty stores and discounters. Even Wal-Mart Stores, the Sun Belt discounter that is the country's fastest-growing retailer, registered only a 7 percent rise in same-store sales in November, smaller than its normal double-digit gain.
 
Delays in Purchasing
 Both retailers and analysts said yesterday that it appears that the last, frantic days will make or break the season. One reason for the delay in buying is the public's perception that shoppers can get lower prices if they wait, they said.
"It is clearly a more competitive and more promotional holiday season," said Kenneth A. Macke, chairman and chief executive of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, in Minneapolis.
In many cases, the reporting companies gave two sets of figures for the month the ended Dec. 1. This was because the retail accounting calendar adds an extra week every few years. This year, the Christmas selling season contains the extra week, so that the monthly sales figures reported yesterday were arbitrarily higher than in the period last year. For this reason, the retailers also reported sales figures that were adjusted as if the number of weeks were equal in both the 1990 and 1989 periods.
Other than Dayton Hudson, which operates not only department stores but promotional apparel and discount stores, the industry's department store segment was battered in the month, according to results computed on the adjusted basis.
Dayton Hudson had a 15.1 percent rise in November sales over all, to $1.55 billion, and a rise of 3.4 percent in same-store sales. But May Department Stores' sales slipped two-tenths of 1 percent in November, to $964.5 million, with a 5 percent drop in same-store sales in the month. Carter Hawley Hale's sales in November dropped 5.4 percent, to $272.7 million, and same-store sales fell 7.4 percent.
 
Discounters Fared Better
 As a group, discounters like Hills Department Stores and Jamesway Stores fared better in the month than traditional department stores or large, mass-volume retailers like Sears.
Some retailers, including R. H. Macy & Company and Montgomery Ward & Company, do not report their sales on a monthly basis. Reporting periods vary slightly and not all retailers have the same fiscal year.
Here are the domestic sales reports for November and for the 10 months from Feb. 1 to Dec. 1, 1990, released yesterday by some of the nation's largest retailers. Figures, except for those of Dayton Hudson, are adjusted so that this year's selling period contains the same number of weeks as last year's.
Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.: Down 5.4 percent for four weeks ended Dec. 1, to $272.7 million; down one-tenth of 1 percent for first 10 months, to $2.2 billion.
Dayton Hudson Corp.: Up 37.4 percent for four weeks ended Dec. 1, to $1.55 billion; up 16.5 percent for first 10 months, to $11.25 billion. (If results were adjusted, sales would have risen 15.1 percent in November.)
J. C. Penney Co.: Down 3.1 percent for four weeks ended Dec. 1, to $1.51 billion; up nine- tenths of 1 percent for first 10 months, to $11.98 billion.
K Mart Corp.: Up 5.1 percent for four weeks ended Nov. 28, to $2.87 billion; up 11 percent for first 10 months, to $25.2 billion.
Limited Inc.: Up 24 percent for four weeks ended Dec. 1, to $508.5 million; up 15.6 percent for first 10 months, to $4.02 billion. (1989 includes results of the Lerner Woman division, which has been sold.)
May Department Stores Co.: Down two- tenths of 1 percent for four weeks ended Dec. 1, to $964.5 million; up 6.3 percent for first 10 months, to $7.72 billion.
Melville Corp.: Up 17.1 percent for four weeks ended Dec. 1, to $886.3 million; up 13.2 percent for first 11 months, to $7.34 billion.
Sears, Roebuck & Co.: Down 1.6 percent for four weeks ended Dec. 1, to $3.1 billion (comparing continuing lines only); up 2.1 percent for first 10 months, to $27.48 billion.
TJX Cos.: Up 10.4 percent for four weeks ended Dec. 1, to $247.5 million; up 12.8 percent for first 10 months, to $2 billion.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.: Up 22 percent for November, to $3.22 billion; up 25 percent for first 10 months, to $25.46 billion.
Woolworth Corp.: Up 4.9 percent for four weeks ended Dec. 1, to $476 million; up 7.4 percent for first 10 months, to $4.33 billion.

HEADLINE: After Brief Hope, New Trade Snag

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Another crisis erupted in the 107-nation trade talks late tonight, dashing hope that had been raised earlier in the day when both the United States and the European Community made concessions that allowed the deadlocked negotiations to continue. The talks are aimed at lowering barriers on the nearly $4 trillion of annual world trade.
The latest crisis resulted from a continuing failure to resolve farm trade issues. The new trouble revived earlier fears of a conference collapse that could bring trade wars and a general worldwide economic decline.
"It's back to ground zero," said John C. Crosbie, Canada's Trade Minister.
 
'Brutally Torpedoed'
 Australia's Minister for Trade Negotiations, Neal Blewett, said he had "never before been in a meeting in which there was a promise of getting a breakthrough and it was so brutally torpedoed." 
 Charges and countercharges have dominated the four days of this conference that aims both to free trade and write rules to govern trade relations into the 21st century.
What caused tonight's breakdown of the agricultural talks was the community's unwillingness -- at the insistence of France -- to negotiate on the basis of a working paper prepared by the community's agricultural negotiating group.
The paper proposed that the community nations make 30 percent cuts in their direct subsidy payments to farmers, their subsidies to promote farm exports and their border protection over five years beginning Jan. 1, 1991. The community had orignally proposed 30 percent cuts in the direct subsidies going back to 1986 and continuing to 1996.
The United States has offered to cut its protection and direct subsidies by 75 percent over the 10 years beginning in January and wants subsidies on exports slashed by 90 percent.
Japan and South Korea, which want to protect their farmers, joined France, the community's principal farm exporter, in vigorously objecting to the compromise formulations, and the meeting broke up in discord.
It was unclear how the crisis would be resolved. Senior ministers are to meet on the agriculture issue Friday morning. One possibility -- suggested by the chief American trade negotiator, Carla A. Hills -- would be to suspend the conference for three to four weeks to give time for political leaders of the United States, Europe and other regions to try to revive the momentum for a trade agreement.
Mrs. Hills called for such a cooling-off period to give the Europeans time to rethink their policies on trade protection for farm products.
 Britain's new Prime Minister, John Major, offered today in London to mediate the agricultural dispute.
Julius L. Katz, the deputy United States trade representative, told reporters that "unless there is a miracle overnight, which doesn't seem likely," the talks would be suspended.
But the European position could be modified Friday at a meeting of the community's Council of Ministers, its highest decision-making authority. The European side in the talks is being led by Frans Andriessen of the Netherlands and Ray MacSharry of Ireland, both Executive Commissioners of the community.
Wednesday night the talks also seemed on the verge of breakdown. The mood shifted after a council meeting today that the Europeans said allowed for greater negotiating flexibility. That was viewed as the community's first expression of willingness to negotiate limitations on farm export subsidies.
The United States showed a more conciliatory approach on the market access it would offer countries willing to cut barriers in tourism, financial services, accounting and other services.
The community is a relatively new food exporter, and the longtime food exporters here have been sharply critical of Europe's subsidies. European producers get billions of dollars of subsidies for dairy, wheat, beef and other products, enabling them to sell below cost in world markets.
The practice affects the trade of many nations, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and many countries in Latin America and the Pacific Basin.
"If this conference fails," said Owen Jennings, president of the Federated Farms of New Zealand, "my message to New Zealand farmers is: 'Batten down the hatches. There are going to be trade wars, and we're going to get trampled.' "
Commenting on the community's earlier show of flexibility, Mats Hellstrom, Sweden's farm minister and the chairman of a negotiating group on agriculture, said this was "the first real negotiation in agriculture" in the four years of the current trade liberalization effort, known as the Uruguay Round because it started in that nation.
The Europeans' refusal to ease protection for their 10 million farmers, 30,000 of whom demonstrated here Monday, has created most of the problems for the conference. But in the end the community may be less intransigent than it now seems to non-Europeans.
Ministers from its 12 member nations meet frequently to reconcile conflicts. Indeed, the community's usual negotiating pattern is crisis followed by small concessions to keep people at the bargaining table until there is a resolution.
 
Source of Frustration
 When other countries negotiate with the community, they often become frustrated by such tactics, which create tensions and sometimes ill-will, both of which have been volubly expressed at this conference.
For example, a high-level negotiating session that started at midnight Wednesday was cut off after about 90 minutes by the chairman, Hector Gros Espiell, Uruguay's Foreign Minister, after some sharp exchanges between the American and European sides.
The community's position has been that it would not move in agriculture until the United States backed off the position on trade in services that it adopted shortly before the conference began. Washington said it would refuse to allow nondiscriminatory access to the United States market to be the starting point for an agreement on services.
The American proposal, strongly backed by the private sector, stunned most other countries. Nondiscriminatory access, otherwise known as "most favored nation" treatment, is one of the hallowed principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 43-year-old international trade charter. The Uruguay Round is being held under the aegis of GATT.
American officials contend that the United States has the most open services market in the world and that by granting most favored nation status as a general principle it would be giving access to foreigners without getting any concessions in return.
But the United States modified that position today, after a strong attack from the Europeans and other negotiators.
"We will work on the basis of unrestricted M.F.N., on condition that all countries make commitments, and we adopt formulas to secure those commitments," a senior American trade official said.
The Uruguay Round seeks to bring agriculture under the GATT trade rules for the first time. The sector was originally excluded at the insistance of the United States.
Although the conference may break up without the political agreements that had been sought, it is likely that officials will search for a way to preserve some of the considerable gains in the other sectors and try later at resolving the farm trade imbroglio.
Many of the American executives and trade group representatives who have accompanied the delegation from Washington said these gains are of real substance for the United States.
For example, many developing countries, eager to attract investment from industrialized countries, made commitments to accept new rules on services and intellectual property.
Brazil, for one, has accepted the principle of equivalent competitive opportunities in financial services that could mean new foreign licenses for insurance companies.
"The key is to cement the gains that have been made here and create a more constructive climate to finish the job," said a former United States trade representative, William Brock, who is here representing a coalition of companies supporting the liberalization effort.

HEADLINE: Transit Cuts Called First Of Many Painful Moves

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
New York City transit officials said yesterday that service cuts proposed on Wednesday are part of a new budget-driven strategy of tailoring service more closely to the fluctuations in ridership.
For decades, the Transit Authority has provided subway and bus service to all New Yorkers, at all hours of the day and night, including weekends, without regard to their destinations or the number of riders on any one line. 
 But now the Transit Authority must operate more like a private business, the officials said, cutting service where riders are scarce. That is because the agency faces record revenue shortages of $272 million for 1991 and about $500 million for 1992.
 
Half-Mile Walks
 "In the past, we have operated under the philosophy that all subway stations on all lines would be served all the time," said Millard Seay, the authority's senior director of scheduling for bus and rail service. "But given the bad economic times and the drop in ridership, we are changing the way we do business."
The cuts proposed Wednesday would save $38 million a year by elminating or shortening bus and subway routes and cutting token-booth service after midnight. Fares would be collected on some trains and a few riders would have to leave trains at elevated stations and wait at the curb for buses to finish the route.
Transit officials said yesterday that the majority of the proposed cuts, which must go through a public hearing process, are expected to go into effect starting in July.
Officials said the cuts would inconvenience riders to an extent unseen since the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. And they acknowledged that, barring unforseen increases in state or Federal subsidies, more service reductions would be necessary.
Under the agency's new strategy, New Yorkers who now use subway and bus lines that have low ridership, particularly in the early-morning hours, could see service on those lines cut drastically or eliminated altogether, transit officials said. In some corners of the city at some hours, people will have to walk as much as a half-mile to find a subway station or a bus stop, Mr. Seay said.
Consumer advocates criticized the agency's new approach, predicting it would alienate customers and reduce ridership at a time when new riders are needed to persuade state legislators to approve a much-needed $12 billion rebuilding plan.
While the agency has not decided where all the service cuts will be made, certain subway and bus lines are particularly vulnerable. Service on the F line, for example, has been scheduled for elimination from midnight to 5 A.M. between Church Avenue and Coney Island in Brooklyn. But parts of other lines have even lower ridership. The Belle Harbor end of the C line in the Rockaways carries only an average of 200 riders from 11 P.M. to 6 A.M. And the No. 3 line along Lenox Avenue in Harlem carries 325 riders in the same period from 145th Street to 148th Street.
 
'Government by Press Release'
 The Transit Authority's new strategy comes as the regional economy is slumping and transit officials are considering raising the $1.15 subway and bus fare for the second time in less than a year and are seeking legislative approval for new operating subsidies and the rebuilding plan.
Some state legislators said yesterday that transit officials are using the proposed service cuts to help make the case for larger subsidies, a fare increase and a new capital budget. The legislators said, though, that if the proposed cuts are put into effect, the transit agency will face an uphill battle in obtaining any increase in financing.
"It's government by press release," said Assemblywoman Catherine T. Nolan, a Democrat of Queens. "It makes me think that this is all a posture to shake the Legislature down for more subsidies. But the authority should realize that this is the kind of thing that doesn't generate a lot of support for them statewide."
Half of the Transit Authority's $2.5 billion-a-year operating budget comes from fare revenues and the other half from government subsidies. About 6 percent of its subsidies come from the Federal Government, 13.9 percent from the state, 13.9 percent from the city, 55.6 percent from taxes on real estate, telephone service and corporate profits, and 10.5 percent from the operating surplus of certain bridges and tunnels.
Gene Russianoff, a lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a consumer group representing New York subway riders, said, "The enactment of this strategy would be the most radical change in subway service since World War II."
Mr. Russianoff predicted that there would be strong opposition from the public and politicians to the Transit Authority's plans to eliminate some subway service altogether. "It's one thing to reduce the frequency of trains to every eight minutes from every six minutes," he said. "But it's quite another to make people get off a train and wait 40 minutes in the cold for a bus."

HEADLINE: American General Halts Auction of Unit

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 6

 BODY:
The American General Corporation said today that it had rejected two offers for its insurance subsidiary, which specializes in marketing policies door to door, and that it would halt its attempt to auction the unit.
The company, the nation's fourth-largest publicly owned insurer, with $34 billion in assets, said it would resume a stock buyback program begun three years ago. It also reduced the annual dividend to $2; it had been increased to $3 a share from $1.58 a share last May. 
 With more than one million shares traded, American General stock fell by $1.50 today, to $28.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
American General's full retreat from the decision last May 2 to auction the entire company underscores the troubles investment bankers are facing in their attempts to raise money to finance large takeovers.
When American General's directors voted to auction the company, Harold S. Hook, chairman and chief executive, forecast offers of more than $7 billion, or $59 a share. The Houston-based company had turned down a stock-and cash offer from the Torchmark Corporation valued at $50 a share.
Torchmark, a smaller insurer based in Birmingham, Ala., said today that it had offered $3.65 billion for American General's home-service unit, which markets life and health insurance policies primarily among middle- and low-income customers in the Southeast.
The deal included $1.05 billion in Torchmark shares and $800 million in cash, and Torchmark would have taken on $1.8 billion of debt in the American General unit. In a brief statement, Torchmark said it was disappointed, but still regarded American General's home service unit a good match for it.
Torchmark's shares rose by $1.375 today, to $48.75, on the New York Stock Exchange. Other companies rumored to have made competing bids for the American General unit were the Capital Holding Corporation, based in Louisville, Ky. and Nationale-Nederlanden, a large Dutch insurer, analysts said.
American General narrowed the auction to its home service unit in late summer, as the weakening economy and weakening stock markets in Europe, Japan and the United States made it unlikely that a bidder could meet American General's price.

HEADLINE: '91 BUDGET DEFICIT WILL SET A RECORD, CONGRESS IS TOLD

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Driven by the weakening economy and the savings and loan bailout, the Federal budget deficit will set a record this year and be even higher the next, despite the budget agreement reached in October, the Congressional Budget Office said today.
Among members of Congress, the mood ranged from sober to grim as Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, reported that the deficit, $220 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, would increase to at least $253 billion in the current fiscal year, 1991, and $262 billion in 1992. 
 Those estimates assume that Congress takes further action to keep military and domestic spending within the limits set in October.
 
Persian Gulf Costs Excluded
 The estimates presented today at a hearing of the House Budget Committee do not incorporate the costs of United States military operations in the Persian Gulf, which some economists say could increase spending by as much as $1 billion a month.
Moreover, these estimates of the deficit include Social Security. If the surplus in the Social Security trust fund is excluded from the calculations, as many people say it should be, the budget deficit would exceed $300 billion this year and next, the budget office said. In theory, money in the trust fund can be used only to pay Social Security benefits and related administrative costs. But the surplus is invested in Treasury securities, which help finance all operations of the Government.
Without the savings achieved in the budget agreement six weeks ago, the deficit would be $35 billion higher in the current fiscal year, Mr. Reischauer said.
 
Difficult Choices Ahead
 The combination of a weak economy and the need for "massive spending to resolve insolvent savings and loan institutions" will push the deficit to record levels, Mr. Reischauer said.
The new numbers strongly suggest that the political and fiscal choices facing Congress and President Bush will be just as difficult in 1991 as they were in the struggle to reach the budget deal this year. The largest deficit to date was $221 billion, in 1986.
The giant budget measure passed in October was widely described as a "deficit-reduction bill." Sponsors were successful in selling it partly because of their determined effort to focus attention on its savings, rather than on the bottom line.
 
Playing Down the Deficit
 Congressional leaders and Administration officials who negotiated the deal talked of the savings in terms of what the deficit would have been in the absence of an agreement. They did not emphasize that the amount of the deficit, in absolute terms, would increase, although that fact could have been inferred from a close reading of the deficit targets set by the legislation.
Realizing that earlier deficit-reduction goals in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law would be impossible to meet, the negotiators proposed goals for savings. They originally sought $50 billion in savings in 1991 and said later they would accept $40 billion, a figure now reduced to $35 billion. Estimates of the deficit varied in that period.
Representative Leon E. Panetta of California, chairman of the Budget Committee, said at the hearing: "We have completed a major landmark agreement, the largest deficit-reduction package in the history of the budget process. It was by no means the solution to the problem, but at least it was the beginning of an effort to try to find an answer and to get some control, some discipline over the deficit."
 
'The Deficit Is Growing'
 Now, he said, with the nation apparently at the beginning of a mild recession, people ask, "Was the agreement too little too late?" Despite the agony of this year's budget negotiations between Congress and the White House, "the fact is that the deficit is growing," Mr. Panetta said.
Representative Jerry Huckaby, Democrat of Louisiana, sounded frustrated as he said, "Even with so much political capital put into the budget agreement, the deficits are increasing rather than decreasing."
No one at today's hearing suggested that the savings envisioned in the budget deal were a sham. Indeed, Mr. Reischauer said they were genuine and would total $496 billion over five years. The savings result from tax increases and from Congressional action to reduce military spending and slow the growth of domestic spending compared with what they otherwise would have been.
Mr. Panetta said that the Pentagon and the State Department were asked and refused to provide testimony at today's hearing about the costs of United States military operations in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Reischauer said Defense Department officials were "having a difficult time" calculating the costs. "We have tried to extract the information from them," he testified. "We have not received what we wanted."
Mr. Reischauer said the spending limits in the new budget law "do not allow appropriations to grow as fast as inflation." If the Government continued services and operations at current levels, he said, military spending would exceed its limit by $9.4 billion in the fiscal year 1992 and domestic spending would run $4.3 billion over the limit. The domestic category includes many popular health and education programs, public works and scientific research.
 
Officials Project Trims
 To comply with the limits, Mr. Reischauer said, Congress would need to trim projected Federal spending by $14 billion in 1992 and by $23 billion in 1993.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the cost of Federal deposit insurance, for savings and loan associations, banks and credit unions, would rise to $91 billion in 1991 and $107 billion in 1992 from $58 billion in the last fiscal year. "Most of this spending is required to close or subsidize the sale of hundreds of insolvent thrift institutions," Mr. Reischauer said.
In 1994 and 1995, he said, the sale of real estate and other savings and loan assets should bring the Government more than the Treasury would spend on insolvent institutions in those years. But Mr. Reischauer said those estimates were not firm. Asked how confident he was about those estimates, he said, "I can assure you they won't change for a month."
The economy was deteriorating even as Congress passed the budget bill in October. Estimates of savings at that time were based on economic assumptions made by the Congressional Budget Office in June. The new estimates are based on assumptions adopted by the budget office in October.
The changes, reflecting sharp increases in oil prices after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, "increase the projected deficit by $41 billion in 1991 and by about $60 billion per year thereafter," Mr. Reischauer said.
A partisan dispute broke into the open at the start of today's hearing. Republicans and Democrats clashed over who should be designated as the official scorekeeper in computing the cost of new legislation: the Congressional Budget Office or the President's Office of Management and Budget. Such calculations may sometimes lead to automatic cuts in Federal benefit programs.
Republicans charged that the Democrats were reneging on an agreement reached in October to expand the role of the Office of Management and Budget. However, Democrats said the Congressional Budget Office had been more reliable and less partisan over the years.
The hearing today was an educational session to lay the groundwork for the next Congress, which convenes in January.

HEADLINE: Japan Import: School Blends Two Cultures

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PURCHASE, N.Y.

 BODY:
Junko Yamamoto's social studies class at Keio High School looks and sounds as if it had been packed in a massive crate and shipped from home: all of her students are of Japanese descent, they study a Japanese textbook, and Ms. Yamamoto lectures in rapid Japanese
But in the cafeteria after class, the same students eat clam chowder and ham on rye and watch MTV on a big television set. Of course, on each table there is a bottle of soy sauce next to the salt and pepper. 
 These conflicting scenes are integral to the daily routine at Keio (pronounced KAY-oh), an experimental private high school where a prominent Japanese university is trying to educate the children of Japanese executives living abroad in a way that will serve them as well in Cambridge, Mass., as it would in Tokyo.
School officials hope to combine the basic elements of two very different high schools -- one Japanese, the other American -- under the same roof in this Westchester County village. But the mix is delicate.
Though all of the school's 120 students are of Japanese descent, they hail from 10 countries and at least 25 percent need tutoring in Japanese. Most of the 16 teachers are from Japan and lecture only in Japanese.
 
Hampered on Examinations
 Some students fear they are being pushed too hard in two very different directions, and worry about preserving their identities. The high school is the first international venture by Tokyo's Keio University, which also runs schools in Japan.
Most of the students are here because they hope to return to Japan for university study but fear that their years away might hamper them on the rigorous entrance examinations to Japanese universities. Keio High School eases those fears by guaranteeing admission to Keio University -- without the examinations -- as long as they keep their grades up.
They will have another edge many of their fellow students will not. "By the time they graduate, I hope all of them are reasonably bilingual and correspondingly bicultural," said Dr. Yasumitsu Nihei, the school's 57-year-old headmaster.
But some of his students worry that, by being both, they will be neither.
Over lunch with friends a week ago, Yumi Terahata, a 14-year-old whose arents live in Seattle, said the workload is frustrating.
"We're going to be half and half, and that's too much of a balance," she said. "I want to be in broadcasting in America. If my English goes down, I won't be able to compete."
Keio University spent $40 million over the last year building the school on 27 acres bought from neighboring Manhattanville College. In September, it opened its doors to 120 10th graders, each paying $12,000 tuition. Eighty-five pay an additional $5,000 to board.
Most of their fathers are businessmen working overseas for up to five years. Sixty percent of the students live in the New York aread.
 
'No Spoonies and Milksops'
 In one classroom a week ago, about 20 students were watching a tape of a Japanese news program describing the nation's failure to cope with overpopulation and provide decent pensions. In another, they were reading: "Here in this young, vigorous country we want no spoonies and milksops . . . ." -- Walt Whitman's reluctant paean to boxing when he was writing editorials.
As Ms. Yamamoto, book in hand, lectured her social studies class on the mechanics of commodities pricing, her students repeatedly nodded their understanding but remained generally quiet. They were not rigid, though: two girls ventured a brief moment of gossip, one boy twirled a pen aimlessly.
They were even more respectful -- and, to judge by the nods, just as comprehending -- in the algebra class of Richard Marx, one of the three American teachers, who scribbled furiously on the blackboard, unlocking the mysteries of rational equations.
All told, the students must sit through a dizzying array of classes: mathematics, science, social studies, music, art and home economics, high-level Japanese and English and a comparative culture course.
To get into Keio, according to the guidebook, they will be judged on their "hope and aptitude," grades, extracurricular activities, community service, American SAT tests, attendance, "reward and punishment," and recommendations.
"The students are complaining that they are suffering from a heavy load of studying," Dr. Nihei said sympathetically. "Maybe some of the teachers are asking too much."

HEADLINE: In Florida, a Private Company Will Operate a Public School

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH, DEC. 6

 BODY:
The half-finished construction project a few blocks from the Art Deco hotels and restaurants at the south end of Miami Beach gives little hint of the educational gamble that will occur there next year.
But when 550 students enter the gates of the South Pointe Elementary School in September they will become subjects of a bold experiment in which the local school board will virtually turn over control of the school to a private, for-profit company. 
 For five years, beginning next fall, the company, Education Alternatives Inc., will help select and train the teachers, design the curriculum and provide educational materials. Teachers will use the same expensive techniques and equipment used at two private academies the company operates in affluent suburbs of Minneapolis and Phoenix -- where the annual tuition runs from $5,000 to $6,000.
The idea of hiring a private company to help run South Pointe began percolating two years ago, when some Dade County schools were filled to twice their capacity and the dropout rate was nearly 30 percent. Heeding the pleas of Superintendent Joseph A. Fernandez, county voters approved a $980 million bond referendum to build 49 schools and renovate 250 existing ones. Mr. Fernandez, who became School Chancellor for New York City this year, then advertised in national newspapers and education magazines for ideas on how the new schools should be run.
 
A School for the Future
 "Rather than having schools designed and operated in same way schools have in the past, we invited proposals from anyone in country who is interested in education on how they would design, plan and operate a 21st century school," said Dr. Frank Petruzielo, an associate superintendent who heads the school system's Bureau of Professionalization. The invitation drew dozens of responses, among them Educational Alternatives.
The school will get about the same financing from Dade County as any other new elementary school, around $1.1 million for salaries and $500,000 for materials and supplies. Extra costs will be borne by the company.
Officials with the Dade County Public Schools say they hope the experiment will not only boost the performance of children at South Pointe but also produce a prototype that could be used in other schools. And if that model is expensive, school officials say, that could provide a lesson to the public in what a good education costs.
"We might be able to come forth with a specific model that will require people to make choices," said Dr. Petruzielo. "We might be able to say, 'This works. You want it? Pay for it.' "
 
Hoping to Breed Success
 Education experts say they believe this is the first time a public school district has hired a private, for-profit company to run a school and the first time a private-school company has tried to duplicate its methods at a public school. Even if the experiment succeeds, it is unclear whether the method would work in other school districts, since it can only be tried in a system that gives much autonomy to individual schools and works with flexible unions.
The performance of Education Alternatives is to be reviewed each year, and the district can choose not to renew the contract if it is dissatisfied.
The methods of the company's private schools, called Tesseract Schools, include extensive use of computers, telephones in every classroom and a ratio of 12 students to every teacher. To replicate them, Education Alternatives has pledged to raise $2.2 million over a five-year period to supplement South Pointe's budget, which has not yet been determined by the school district. The money will be contributed by private foundations and corporations, and part of it will be used to pay the company's annual fee, from $200,000 to $275,000 a year.
"We have gotten several verbal commitments and expect to have hard dollars in before the year is out," said John T. Golle, chairman and chief executive officer of the company. "But we are looking for more."
He added that he does not expect to turn a profit from the Miami venture. He said he wants to use South Pointe as a marketing tool to demonstrate that his company can produce quantifiable improvement in academic performance regardless of the students' educational or economic background.
 
Using Graduate Students
 "I'm not ashamed to admit that if our system works, the world is going to beat a path to our door," he said by telephone from the company's headquarters in Minneapolis.
To achieve the desired student-teacher ratio while keeping costs down, the school will employ first-year graduate students from the University of Miami as part-time teachers. The aides will be paid $7 an hour and will get credits towards a master's degree in education. This use of graduate students required a waiver of a provision in the contract between the school board and the teachers union. Other exemptions from the labor agreement are anticipated before the school opens.
"The union's commitment and the school board's are identical: quality education and improved education," said Yvonne Burkholz, director of labor for The United Teachers of Dade, explaining why the union agreed to change aspects of its contract. "We thrive when the public perceives that we are willing to take risks."
Officials at Education Alternatives caution that their methods are not a panacea for all public schools.
 
Some Districts Too Daunting
 "We're not looking to do an impossible task," Mr. Golle said. "There are some districts in the country we won't go in, because the challenges are too great."
The task facing Mr. Golle is daunting. South Pointe will draw its students from two overcrowded elementary schools; new zoning lines will be drawn so that its students will come from a geographic area, and not from families applying to send children there. More than 85 percent of the students at one school and 79 percent of those at the other are eligible under Federal law for free or reduced-cost lunches. Reading scores at both schools are well below the national average. More than 80 percent of the children are Hispanic, many of them recent immigrants from Central America who speak little or no English.
Moreover, the neighborhood is known as a temporary way station that many families leave when they can afford higher rents. "That's what scares me the most," said Linda Lentin, who will be South Pointe's lead teacher, supervising other teachers in lieu of an assistant principal. "We have a transient population there. I hope we will have enough time to make a difference in their lives and prove what Tesseract can do."
Tesseract is named after an imaginary corridor through which the main characters travel in the children's book, "A Wrinkle in Time," by Madeline L'Engle. The concept was developed by a subsidiary of the Control Data Corporation, which designed an education model that could be used in a chain of private, for-profit elementary schools. Mr. Golle formed Education Alternatives and bought the subsidiary for $10 million in 1986.
 
A Plan for Each Student
 Dade County school officials also hope South Pointe will attract children of the growing number of middle class residents who have moved to the southern end of Miami Beach in the last few years, but who have placed their children in private schools.
"This excites me, because I think private schools get better attention than do public schools -- more money, newer equipment, computers," said Jana DiConstanzo, the office manager of a restaurant, who plans to send her son, Francis, 5, to South Pointe next year. Francis currently attends a parochial school in downtown Miami.
South Pointe will be divided into four mini-schools of 125 to 150 students, and the pupils and teachers will remain together from kindergarten through sixth grade. Mr. Golle said this encourages a sense of community and belonging among pupils, which he feels is necessary for children to be successful in school.
Instruction is to be tailored for each student. Each year teachers, in consultation with parents, will draw up a "personal education plan" setting goals for individual students. Students will work at their own pace and will be encouraged to help each other. There will be no grades, although the students will take the same standardized tests other Dade County pupils take.
Teachers will not lecture in front of a classroom; they will move about, helping students as they work individually or in small groups. Computers will be used not only as learning aids but also to allow teachers to track a student's progress.
 
Calling Parents From Class
 Periodically, an audio tape in the student's native language will be sent home so parents can keep up with their child's progress. To reinforce a feeling of accomplishment and to involve parents, students will be encouraged to telephone their parents from the classroom after successfully completing a task, to share the experience with them.
"We try to avoid the situation where a parent asks his kid what did you do in school today, and the answer is, nothing, or I forgot," Mr. Golle said.
Those who have been pressing for reform of the nation's school system will be watching the South Pointe experiment closely.
"I think it's a terrific innovation, well worth trying, and I'm glad they're doing it," said Chester E. Finn Jr., professor of education and public policy at Vanderbilt University. "Will it work? Who knows."

Deal Reported on Settlement Payments in Collusion Case

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROSEMONT, Ill., Dec. 6

 BODY:
Major league club owners will pay the players' union $120 million Jan. 2, then complete their $280 million collusion settlement payment in four installments of $40 million each over the next 15 months.
Under terms of the settlement, details of which were disclosed today by a lawyer familiar with the negotiations, the $40 million payments, plus accrued interest, will be made next July 15, Sept. 15, Nov. 15, and April 15, 1992. The owners will invest the money in Federal Government-backed securities until the payments are made. 
 The payment schedule is a chief feature of the terms of the settlement. Another is the granting of free-look free agency for 15 players from the 1987 group of free agents. Those players could be free as early as Friday to seek contracts with other teams.
Some details remain to be worked out before the settlement is completed, but the owners, at their meeting here Wednesday, and the players' executive board, at its meeting in Orlando, Fla., today, adopted similar resolutions authorizing their negotiators to agree on a settlement that included terms stipulated in the resolutions.
 
Competition May Be Spirited
 The resolutions noted that "both parties will make their best effort to get a comprehensive settlement by Dec. 13."
Some of the new free agents could command immediate and heavy attention. The Atlanta Braves, for example, can hardly wait until they can legally approach Brett Butler, then make him a large offer to become their center fielder. Butler, who began his career with the Braves, lives in the Atlanta area and is a favorite of Ted Turner, the Braves' owner.
But the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego Padres are also interested in the leadoff hitter, and the competition could become spirited and expensive.
Butler is certain to command the kind of contract (four years, $13 million) that the San Francisco Giants gave Willie McGee, leaving Butler with no alternative but to leave them. Butler, as an initial approach, asked the Giants for $15 million, but that was because Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell had $15 million contracts.
 
Attention Likely for Clark
 Jack Clark, who has been bumped from first base in San Diego by Fred McGriff, is another impending free agent who will attract instant attention. The suddenly active Toronto Blue Jays and the Boston Red Sox are prepared to compete, among others, for his services as a power-hitting designated hitter. Several teams need a third baseman, which should make Gary Gaetti a popular free agent.
While the 15 players seek to improve the economic status that an arbitrator said was damaged by the owners' collusive practices, the Players Association will attend to more general matters.
The union, according to the terms, will have the "sole and exclusive responsibility" of developing a plan for the allocation and distribution of players' individual claims on loss of salary. The union must recommend the plan to the two arbitrators who decided the collusion cases, and the arbitrators have to approve it.
When other arbitrators hear salary arbitration cases in the first three weeks in February, they will be given statements regarding the amounts by which aggregate player salaries were reduced in five seasons, 1986 through 1990, because of club violations.
 
May Affect Arbitration
 The arbitrators will also receive a statement regarding the amount by which average salaries in service groups were reduced in 1989 and 1990 because of the collusion.
Armed with those figures, the arbitrators may award higher salaries than they might have the past several years. Players would certainly be expected to seek higher salaries, arguing that their previous salaries had been depressed under the weight of collusion.
The settlement also addresses major league service time. Thirteen free agents who missed the early parts of seasons because they had not signed with anyone will be given credit for full seasons of service.
The union can also ask the arbitrators to award additional service for other players who missed time, but the Player Relations Committee can take the opposite position, leaving it for the arbitrators to decide.

HEADLINE: How to Choke Iraq

 BODY:
Saddam Hussein certainly seems to be budging. Last week, in a trivial gesture, he sent a few cases of food to the embattled American Embassy in Kuwait. Now he offers a noteworthy gesture: release of all the foreign hostages Iraq has held since the Persian Gulf crisis began in August.
These steps, immediately following a forceful United Nations Security Council resolution, suggest that he has come to appreciate just how unified the world is in its outrage at his aggression. Now the coalition arrayed against him can turn its full attention to larger purposes -- getting Iraq out of Kuwait and assuring stability for the nations around the Persian Gulf. 
 It is conceivable that President Bush's recent bellicosity has speeded things along, but that's speculative. What has all along seemed certain is that the best way to squeeze Iraq is by economic pressure and diplomacy.
In Senate testimony, William Webster, the Director of Central Intelligence, has given new support for that posture. He said what the Administration must have known all along but has refused to concede: that the economic embargo is quietly but surely strangling Iraq's economy and will soon start sapping its military strength.
The embargo has shut off more than 90 percent of President Hussein's imports and 97 percent of his petroleum export revenues. He has been forced to forfeit $1.5 billion in foreign exchange earnings every month for four months now. And his hard currency reserves, essential to pay for smuggling, are running out.
Denied critical inputs like fuel additives, Iraq's economy is slowing down -- and much sooner than anticipated. Well-informed experts like James Schlesinger estimate civilian production declined some 40 percent in three months. Soon the embargo will hurt where it counts, in military capacity. Already the army and air force have curtailed training and reconnaissance to reduce wear and tear on equipment and conserve on fuel.
The longer the embargo lasts, the less able Iraq will be to defend its army in Kuwait. That's an important counterpoint to those who say that time is on Iraq's side, and that the allies must strike soon.
The Administration worries about the coalition's willingness to sustain the embargo over the long haul. But that strain cannot compare to the strains war would impose.
It's also true that some holes may open in the embargo. But they won't be large enough to satisfy Iraq's growing needs. Indeed, the siege can be tightened. Air traffic through Jordan can be curtailed. Shipping can be subject to more intrusive inspection. Smuggling via Jordan, Iran and Turkey can be interdicted more effectively.
Granted, economic embargo can't guarantee Saddam Hussein's departure from Kuwait. But neither can a limited war, certainly not the friction-free air strike dear to so many armchair strategists.
War is as likely to erode as restore security and stability in the region. Indeed, in the long run only economic and diplomatic means can check Mr. Hussein's expansionist ambitions and keep him from getting his hands on critical materials for manufacturing chemical and nuclear weapons.
President Bush quickly, wisely and boldly put a firm chokehold on Iraq. It remains a shrewder policy than impatiently grabbing for his gun.

HEADLINE: Agreement, at Last, on Police

 BODY:
This autumn's financial crisis followed last summer's crime crisis, forcing New York City officials to decide just how much more they are prepared to pay to improve public confidence and public safety.
The criminal justice program emerging from negotiations between the Mayor and City Council gives an answer: $450 million a year. Some aspects of timing and financing remain dubious, but on the whole, the plan deserves support. 
 Mayor Dinkins came down from a $650 million proposal while the City Council Speaker, Peter Vallone, came up from $300 million. The compromise calls for 5,797 new police officers on patrol duty -- 743 fewer than in the original Dinkins plan. There is also money for courts, jails and schools.
An increase in the property tax would pay for $150 million of the program. Extension of an income tax surcharge set to expire in 1992 would eventually add $184 million more. The balance would come from a new city lottery.
Because the Council balked at even higher property taxes before the 1992 election, only a third of the new police would be hired before 1993. And another regressive lottery is hardly an attractive financing source.
But the plan at least establishes a firm schedule for bringing the police force up to adequate strength. The lottery and the income tax surcharge extension require Albany's approval, and city officials are lobbying hard for it during the current special session.
New Yorkers need to know that fiscal austerity hasn't paralyzed government. Swift approval of the Dinkins-Vallone compromise would provide that reassurance.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
'A Broken Dream'

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Yuval Neria looks like a romantic vision of an Israeli poet: dark eyes, curly black-and-gray hair. In fact he is a war hero. As a 21-year-old lieutenant in the 1973 Middle East war, he twice jumped to another tank when his was destroyed. He won Israel's highest decoration, the Medal of Valor. "I was quite meshuginah," he says -- crazy.
Now he is a clinical psychologist and the author of a best seller on the 1973 war, "Fire," something between autobiography and fiction. He also helped to found the organization Peace Now, and he is in the United States at the moment conveying its message. 
 But what is Peace Now's message at such a time? The organization has favored Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories and negotiations with the Palestinians. But the Persian Gulf crisis and Palestinian support for Saddam Hussein have made the prospects for Israeli-Palestinian peace even more remote than they were.
"Separation," Mr. Neria said when we met the other day. By that he meant physically separating Israel within its 1967 borders, to the extent possible, from the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
"We are flooded with traumatic events," he said: "the murder of three Israelis in Jerusalem a month ago, this week the Palestinians attacking with knives on a bus, the incidents on the borders. The people are so angry. There is no negotiation, no hope -- none for us, none for the Palestinians.
"We need some time to let us regain a little quiet, to reduce the anxiety. It's an immediate necessity. I don't want to enter into a paranoiac state where everyone is suspicious of everyone, and we are very close to it now."
If the 1967 border were actually closed, I asked, how would the Palestinians in the occupied territories survive? They are heavily dependent, especially in Gaza, on work in Israel. Mr. Neria said international economic aid would be necessary, but he confessed that he had no detailed solutions. He only wanted to prevent the situation from getting worse.
The official position of Peace Now is more complex. It still calls for negotiations and a political settlement with the Palestinians. But a statement last month called for "gradual economic separation between Israel and the territories," by promoting economic self-sufficiency in the West Bank and Gaza.
Prime Minister Shamir and his Likud bloc have always favored a Greater Israel including the West Bank and Gaza. But curiously, events seem to be pushing them toward increasing emphasis on the 1967 borders. Events are confirming Peace Now's view that holding onto the occupied territories harms Israel's security.
The events are violent attacks by Palestinians, especially since the police killing of 17 Palestinians in Jerusalem on Oct. 8. In the last two months more than 20 Israelis have been stabbed by Arabs; 5 died of their wounds. Some of the incidents have occurred far from the borders, one in Tel Aviv, and many more Israelis have taken to carrying weapons.
To try to prevent such attacks, the army and the police have sharply restricted Palestinian entry into Israel across what had been an open border. This week a new network of roadblocks was set up along the border, and the police were ordered to check Palestinians closely, including the use of metal detectors.
"Shamir cannot admit the end of Greater Israel," Mr. Neria said. "But those who advise him -- the army and so on -- know it is a myth, a broken dream.
"I'm not in politics, I can't say. But the younger people in the Likud must not be able to deny reality."
Mr. Neria's parents were both professional soldiers: his father a colonel, his mother "a lieutenant colonel like me," Mr. Neria said. (That is his rank in the reserves.) His parents were in the Palmach, the elite unit of the Haganah, the Jewish underground army before the state was born in 1948. They fought in the War of Independence that year, then in the wars of 1956 and 1967.
"They had the dream that after 1948 their world would change," Mr. Neria said. "I remember my mother telling me that the War of Independence would be the last war; after that nothing would happen to the Jewish people.
"I think the only hope for them is that there are still young people who have enough energy to fight for peace. They are very supportive of Peace Now, which is important for me."

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
The Planes of Change

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

DATELINE: TEL AVIV

 BODY:
The plane landed at 4 in the morning. Ten minutes later, the passengers walked eagerly down the ramp to begin a new life in a country that exists perpetually in condition of war, siege or danger.
A small crowd of Israeli youngsters waited to deliver huge hugs, homemade sponge cake, coffee, plastic flags and the national anthem, in that appropriate order. Other planes came in later and for every one the kisses and the cakes were fresh. 
 Every day about 1,000 Soviet Jews land in Israel. In a few years, at least a million immigrants will arrive, one-quarter of Israel's present Jewish population. It is something like trying to fit all the people of France into the United States -- and make them happy, too.
The threat of war in the Persian Gulf, which could bring bombs on Israel, has frightened tourists off -- but not the immigrants from the Soviet Union. More and more of them, instead of fewer and fewer, line up in Moscow for visas, preferring the risks of the Middle East to life in any Soviet Union they can conceive.
They will change the face and future of Israel, change its economy, its politics, the way it thinks and acts. Israelis are sure of this: absorbing these many new citizens will be one of the most difficult jobs Israel has ever faced, and the migration will be the best thing that has happened to this country since independence -- if. If the voters force Israeli leaders to reform their country's political and economic systems.
The people who come off the plane every day are a gold mine of talent, energy and desire. It is a migration proportionally richer in skills than the existing Israeli population. Richer in university graduates, engineers, physicians, scientists and musicians. Right now they will do anything at all -- carpentry, street cleaning, construction work, anything. That startles some Israelis who see "menial" work as not quite fitting for the intelligentsia. But one day not too far away, Israel will have to create enough new enterprises to find enough new jobs to make the newcomers feel fufilled professionally and economically.
For the next year or so, many of the new Israelis are doubling up with relatives or friends who were able to get out of the Soviet Union a few years ago. But the supply of cousins is running out. With every planeload, the pressure for homes increases on a Government already a year behind in building them.
The pressure to absorb Soviet Jews quickly and decently may finally force Israeli politicians to cut apart the net of government ownership and control, an outdated legacy from Israel's early days. It discourages foreign investment, and is a leg iron on Israeli domestic enterprise and initiative.
These immigrants become citizens the moment they land. They will vote. Logically, the newcomers' rich, full detestation of anything that smacks of socialism should bring them to the conservative Likud rather than Labor. But the chances are that like a lot of other Israelis, they will vote in the next national election for the party that will actually do what Israeli politicians keep promising and keep failing to deliver.
That is to reform an election system that makes electing a strong majority government almost impossible. The system hands tiny extremist or splinter parties a blackmail role -- give us ministerial jobs or we swing to the other side. It guarantees confusion, corruption and weakness in any government that manages to put together a patchwork majority.
Without government reform and economic modernization, the absorption will falter. The treasure of talent will lie untapped. The pressure for change is the biggest gift the new Israelis are bringing to this country.
At the airport, strange thoughts crossed my mind. Could it be that these people, these doctors, engineers and architects so full of life's juices that they accept privation and danger for the chance to work, will one day be allowed to make the rest of the Middle East a better place to live?
Enough doctors will be coming to Israel over the next few years to give succor to the sick of the whole Middle East. Will the day ever come when a Jewish doctor from Israel can tend the Muslim sick as immigrant Muslim doctors make the rounds in New York hospitals, caring for Jew or non-Jew without question from physician or patient?
Is it a useless dream to think of this? Or is it a nightmare not to think of it? I take a piece of cake while I examine that thought. Both are delicious.

HEADLINE: Israel Frays Its Tie With America

BYLINE: By Harold H. Saunders; Harold H. Saunders, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs from 1978 to 1981, is a Brookings Institution fellow.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Israelis fear that because of the Persian Gulf crisis America is moving away from Israel and toward the Arabs. But they are wrong. The U.S. commitment to Israel is not that shallow.
The Israelis' concern should form the starting point of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's meeting with President Bush in coming days. Mr. Shamir should appreciate that the real danger to the U.S.-Israeli relationship is political, not strategic. Israel, by its hardline control over all Palestine, has been heightening that danger. 
 Responding to violence, the Israelis have considered greater separation between themselves and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Such permanent action could lead to apartheid, which would shake the foundations of the U.S.-Israeli relationship.
The U.S. remains committed to a Jewish state -- but to one sharing Palestine with its Arab neighbors, not dominating all of it.
Will Israel address the violence by further control, repression, separatism? Or, more sensibly, will it talk with the Palestinians about how they could, in freedom, run their own body politic? The choice is Israel's, although the Palestinians must demonstrate that Israel can make that choice without jeopardizing its security.
Some Israelis say the unprecedented U.S. security collaboration with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria to counter Iraq's seizure of Kuwait is undermining the strategic foundations of the Israel-U.S. relationship. In addition, Israelis have interpreted U.S. support for sharp U.N. resolutions voted after Israeli police killed at least 17 Palestinians at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem as placating the new strategic partners.
Israel should not forget America's consistent support since Israel's founding in 1948. Nor should both sides misread the human and political foundations of that commitment: No President could sit still while Israel suffered serious harm.
Israel's desire to be described as a U.S. strategic asset against the spread of Communism was an argument of convenience that served Israel. Today, the Soviet-U.S. relationship is changing, and Israel is improving its relations with the Soviet Union.
But the human commitment endures and transcends strategic concerns -- so long as both sides remain committed to the deepest values of our common tradition, among them human rights principles. Israeli acts that erode that compact threaten the relationship.
That compact was forged at the U.N. when the U.S. voted on Nov. 29, 1947, to partition Palestine between a Jewish and an Arab state. Concern for fairness in an unfair situation made the U.S. reject a solution in which one people might annex or suppress the other. Even the Balfour Declaration in 1917 spoke of establishing a national home for the Jewish people, while doing nothing "which may prejudice the civil and religious rights and existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine."
The U.S. has faithfully kept its commitment, from Security Council Resolution 242 in 1967 through the Camp David Accords and Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. That commitment has always been to an Israel sharing the land fairly with its Arab neighbors.
While the U.S. position has remained solid, since 1977 Israel has sought permanent control of all the land west of the Jordan River. All these years, even after 1977, the U.S. has protected Israel from a hostile world at the U.N., and through large-scale aid it has helped Israel defend itself and buttress its economy. The U.S. designed the peace process of the 70's to move one careful step at a time so that Israel could test its neighbors' readiness for new relationships.
Just yesterday, Secretary of State James Baker reiterated opposition to a premature Middle East peace conference by rejecting an effort by a group of neutral nations to persuade the Security Council to approve a resolution calling for such a conference to discuss Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
In promoting its interest in protecting global access to Middle East oil and resisting Iraqi aggression, the U.S. has consulted with Israel even has it has cooperated with key Arab countries. Similarly, for years the U.S. has walked a fine line between its Arab and Israeli interests without damaging Israel, despite Israeli alarms.
In the gulf crisis, the U.S. is hotly debating a delicate balance between political and military pressure on Saddam Hussein. Foreign Minister David Levy has entered that debate, apparently advocating U.S. military action, by warning against "a situation in which all the Western armies will leave the gulf and Saddam Hussein will emerge with certain advantages." If Israel, by so intruding itself in the debate, undercuts the U.S. effort to contain Iraq, it will harm the mutual relationship.
After the gulf crisis subsides, an effort to reconstitute the peace process -- involving honest attempts at reconciliation in a shared land -- will be essential. This should not be linked to a solution to the Kuwait problem. But it will be necessary because it will be right, vital to Israel's survival, critical to sustaining a strong U.S. position in the Middle East (which serves Israel's interests) and essential to the health of the Israeli-U.S. relationship. Until the crisis is over, Israel's treatment of the Palestinians could open - or close - doors to the peace process.

HEADLINE: When It's a Recession

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Greenspan Says Nation's Economy Is in a Downturn," (front page, Nov. 29), on the Congressional testimony of the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, asserts that the "official definition of a recession is a decline in the gross national product for two consecutive quarters." That is just one popular definition of a recession.
As I understand it, the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, whose recognition of a recession is what makes it official, looks not just at the duration of a downturn, but also at its depth and diffusion, and the committee looks at output, income, employment and trade, in making that determination.
Thus, two successive quarters of decline in G.N.P. are neither necessary nor sufficient for a recession to occur.

HEADLINE: Daily News Fights for Present and Future Economic Survival;
Management's Weapon

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Striking Out at Public Order," on The Daily News strike (editorial, Nov. 2), ignores fundamental facts about labor relations in the United States. When Congress passed the Wagner Act, giving workers the right to form unions and protection for concerted action, the country was on the verge of industrial warfare. The act established a peaceful process for workers and employers to solve disputes by negotiation. The process worked with Government support. 
 In 1981, Government support was withdrawn when the Reagan Administration fired striking air traffic controllers and dissolved the workers' voluntary organization. This told management it was acceptable to wage warfare on employees and unions. Employers permanently replaced workers striking over economic issues.
The law says you cannot be fired for striking, but you can be permanently replaced. The effect is the same. Many employers started to see the strike as their weapon, not the unions'. They learned that by forcing workers to strike, they could replace them forever with nonunion employees and eliminate having to negotiate wages, hours and working conditions with employees.
Violence cannot be condoned in a strike, but the sword cuts both ways. Is it not a violent act to deprive a worker of a job forever for exercising the right to strike?
As a union organizer I have worked with employees throughout the country seeking to form unions. Their frustration is real. It is, I am sorry to say, reaching the point where if Congress does not act to reform labor law, and prevent striking workers from being permanently replaced, the violence occurring today in New York will be repeated across the country.

HEADLINE: Oil Price Down Again on Hostage Decision

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The decision by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to free all hostages helped send oil prices plummeting at the opening yesterday, adding to the sharp drop the day before on hopes for peace. But the market began rising later in the day, as traders wondered exactly how far the crisis stands from peaceful resolution.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for delivery next month fell 89 cents a barrel, to $26.40, the lowest close since Aug. 29. The price of oil has dropped $4.26 a barrel over the last two days. 
 At one point in the morning yesterday, oil was trading as low as $25.25 a barrel. On Aug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait, the similar contract closed at $21.54. Analysts differ on exactly how low the price would be without the threat of war but agree that most of the "war premium" is gone.
In a separate action, the New York Mercantile Exchange said yesterday that it had formulated new rules to deal with extreme volatility in prices. Under the proposal, trading would cease for the day if the price of oil moved $15 a barrel in either direction on the contracts for the nearest two months, and it would close for one hour if the price moved $7.50.
The change must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and market experts pointed out that both of the new proposed limits were far larger than even the biggest move this year, which was a $5.41-a-barrel decline, on Oct. 19.
Analysts attributed the move over the last two days to the perception of a sharply lower risk of war.
"People have been taken to the brink of peace and looked in -- and it's concentrated their minds," said Michael C. Lynch, a senior research associate at the Washington International Energy Group.
But referring to a possible visit to Washington by the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, Mr. Lynch warned that the price could shoot up again. "If Aziz comes to Washington and says, 'If the Israelis get out of the West Bank we'll be happy,' and then Bush says, 'Go home,' then the war premium goes back up to $10," he said.
Some people noted that Mr. Hussein had not said exactly how and when the hostages would be leaving. "One has to give a lot of credit to Saddam Hussein for his deft manipulation of our psyches," said Peter C. Beutel of Pegasus Econometrics in Hoboken, N.J.
 
'All the Good News Is Out'
 Shahrokh Nikkhah, vice president for futures at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said the market had descended a little too low this morning in its expectation of peace. Explaining the turn back up in price he said, "I think today people looked at the substance of the differences between Iraq and the United States and realized there is still a big difference."
Of the price between now and Jan. 15, the deadline set by the United Nations Security Council resolution for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, he said unhappy surprises were possible.
"All the good news is out now," he said. "Any news that could come up now, unfortunately, is that there are differences between the United States and Iraq."
Another trader, Tom Bentz of United Energy Inc., said: "People are reading a lot in between the lines of what's actually being said. I personally don't think we're that close to a peaceful solution." He said that the market could turn around and move up today.
 
The Merc's Proposal
 Under the details of the rules announced today by the Mercantile Exchange to curb price volatility, if the price moved $7.50 a barrel, or 20 cents a gallon for oil products, and trading was halted, then when it resumed, movement would be limited to another $7.50 a barrel in the same direction. There would be no time out, however, if the limit was reached in the last two minutes of a trading session. There would also be no limits in the last half-hour of the day of the contract's expiration.
A pause, said Z. Lou Guttman, chairman of the exchange, would allow opportunity "for additional information dissemination, the review of margins and other financial considerations, consultation between Government officials and the exchange board and staff," and for consultation by traders with customers.
The most prominent of the exchange's critics, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, said yesterday in a statement that "a $15-per-barrel increase in one day is still huge and unacceptable." He pointed out that some analysts had predicted a price of $100 a barrel in case of war. "Still," he added, "I appreciate the fact that Nymex has the foresight to announce its plans, however modest they are, in advance."
Mr. Bentz of United Energy praised the proposed rules. "Markets sometimes have a way in panic situations of overdoing things," he said. A break in trading, he added, would be a chance to pause "until the market can get ahold of what's really going on and people can calm themselves."
But Mr. Beutel said the limit was unlikely to be reached in all but the most extreme circumstances.
"You'd have to catch everybody by surprise with something humongous in terms of news," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 20, 1990, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Dec.7 about a rule change proposed by the New York Mercantile Exchange to curb volatility in oil trading misstated what would happen if the price moved by the daily limit, $15 a barrel up or down, on the contracts for the nearest two months. If that limit was reached, trading could continue, but only at prices within the $15 limit. It would not be halted.

Vice Chairman Named At Salomon Brothers

BYLINE: By H. J. Maidenberg

 BODY:
Salomon Brothers Inc. yesterday announced the appointment of Deryck C. Maughan as its fifth vice chairman, effective Jan. 1. The 43-year-old British-born executive is chairman of Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd.
Mr. Maughan will also become the seventh member of the office of chairman, which is the investment banking firm's management group. 
 Mr. Maughan joined Salomon in 1983 and became a managing director in 1986. Shortly after joining Salomon, he went to the firm's Tokyo office where, a company spokesman said, he developed an expertise in Japanese economic and financial affairs.
That interest in Japan's economic development led him to become a founding member of the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange. He is also active in the America-Japan Society.
After his position in Japan, Mr. Maughan became Salomon's corporate and international fixed-income product manager in New York.
Before joining Salomon Brothers, Mr. Maughan worked in the London office of Goldman, Sachs & Company for four years. Before that, he served with the British Treasury as an adviser on global economic and financial affairs for 10 years after graduating from King's College at the University of London in 1969. He also earned a master's degree from the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University.
In addition to Mr. Maughan's appointment, Salomon announced it had added 14 new managing directors, also effective Jan. 1. The new appointments will raise the number of Salomon's managing directors to 164.
The new managing directors are: Joseph Anastasio, domestic support-operations; Christopher Baine, Tokyo sales management; Victor Haghani, domestic fixed-income arbitrage; Gregory Hawkins, domestic fixed-income arbitrage; Robert Huffman, domestic fixed-income sales; Toshiharu Kido, Tokyo fixed-income sales; Richard Lampen, domestic investment banking; William McDonald, domestic investment banking; David Shulman, domestic research/real estate; Rick Singer, domestic investment banking; Robert Smith, domestic investment banking; Richard Stuckey, domestic hedge management; Scott Wilson, domestic investment banking, and Gary Wolens, European equities.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
Saudis and U.S. Aides Wary Over Iraqi Move

BYLINE: By JAMES LeMOYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Saudi and American officials here are reacting with some wariness and concern to the generally welcome news that Iraq will release its Western hostages.
While the release of the hostages was a major objective, both Saudi and American officials here have long worried that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq would release hostages not as a prelude to a complete withdrawal from Kuwait but as a shrewd gambit to weaken the international coalition against him. 
 A senior American military commander said this idea raises the prospect of a prolonged Iraqi presence in Kuwait, continued American deployment in Saudi Arabia, declining support for war and a long, exasperating political confrontation with Iraq in which Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations would probably feel increasingly vulnerable.
"This means the war is over," said a worried Saudi official who deals in foreign affairs. "It's going to be almost impossible to keep the pressure up if Saddam releases the hostages."
 
Saudis to Redouble Efforts
 The official said Saudi Arabia feared that it would eventually be left to face a still armed and agressive Iraq. He added that Saudi Arabia would redouble efforts to keep the United Nations embargo against Iraq as severe as possible and to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait and pay to rebuild what it has destroyed.
Senior American officials here have long expressed concern that Iraq would use the hostages as part of an extended confrontation aimed at breaking up the embargo.
American officials often seem torn between a desire to avoid war and a desire to seize the moment to destroy Iraq's military might.
Speaking a few days before the surprise announcement that Iraq would release its hostages, a senior American commander here said American military planners had visualized what they call a nightmare scenario in which Mr. Hussein avoids war, maintains his military strength and keeps part of Kuwait.
The scenario, the commander said, begins with the Iraqi release of all hostages, a move aimed at calming passions. Then Mr. Hussein begins a gradual withdrawal from Kuwait, while opening negotiations.
 
Sagging of Will Feared
 As talks drag on, and international and American will sags, and Mr. Hussein announces that he will give up all of Kuwait except perhaps a few islands in the Persian Gulf and a major oil field next to the Iraqi border.
American military and political strategists say they fear that such a series of steps will make it impossible to force Mr. Hussein to leave Kuwait entirely, or to pay for the damage and death he has caused. It will also be difficult to strip his army of chemical and biological weapons, and perhaps the nuclear ability that he appears to be trying to build, the senior American commander said.
Saudi officials fear a similar outcome at a moment when a quiet debate here has brought contradictory statements from influential Saudis. There is a fear that the United States will lose resolve, and there is equal concern that the costs of war will destabilize the region and make Saudi Arabia a sort of pariah in the eyes of other Arabs.
The two views share a profound sense of vulnerability that many Saudis seem to feel at a moment of crisis.
"We're completely exposed," a well-connected Saudi businessman said. "Other Arabs are going to blame us for years for bringing in the Americans and attacking Iraq. It's a bad feeling for us."
 
'We Aren't Safe' From Iraq
 But in the next breath, the same businessman said he hoped the United States would attack immediately because, "we know we aren't safe so long as Saddam has these big weapons and his army."
Other influential Saudis are more cautious.
An influential Government administrator who is a private adviser to the royal family said in an interview this week that he and several of his closest friends were counseling against war for as long as a year, to see if economic sanctions will cripple Iraq.
"War is easy to start, but few can know how it will end," the administrator said. "I think war will destabilize the region for years at endless cost."
"Why is it necessary to rush to war so quickly?" the official continued. "The embargo has cut off Iraq's income. I think within a year, Saddam will be severely weakened and his military will be out of parts. If he still won't withdraw from Kuwait, attack him then."
 
Worried About Support
 Both American and Saudi officials said, however, that they are deeply worried by the difficulty of maintaining international support and the embargo against Iraq, while winning political backing from several countries for a continuing military buildup here to be ready to wage war if necessary.
Saudi and American officials said the hostage release would force them to reconsider previous assumptions on the duration and nature of the military deployment under way against Iraq.
A central consideration, they said, will be the question of a long confrontation that never quite reaches the point of war, but that lasts for another year or more.
"All kinds of things are possible, but I don't think anyone came here thinking they were going to spend a year in the desert," an American military commander said. "It's very hard to predict the outcome of that sort of standoff."

HEADLINE: Waiting for the Zapping of Nintendo

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Will Nintendo, the world's biggest maker of computer games, be zapped this increasingly bleak Christmas? Many stock analysts think so. Nintendo competitors hope so.
Nintendo says, dream on. 
 More than the dominance of games like Super Mario Brothers 3 and the Legend of Zelda is at stake. Nintendo, the toy sensation of the last three Christmases, remains the best-selling toy in the industry, and its fate may signal whether consumers will continue to pay high prices for toys.
Of every dollar Americans spent on toys last year, 16 cents went to Nintendo. That was $2.7 billion out of a total $16.8 billion that Mom and Dad did not spend on Barbie dolls, Hulk Hogan "action figures," licensed merchandise like Batman soap or Scattergories board games.
While Nintendo's rivals, like Sega of America and NEC Technologies , say their sales are better than expected, they remain tiny blips on the radar screen of Nintendo, which has more than 90 percent of the game market.
Even so, Nintendo has had to scale back its sales projections. Looking at a looming recession and continued tensions in the Middle East, some toy industry experts are predicting that consumers will cut back on expensive Christmas toys like Nintendo. But even with slow third-quarter sales, Nintendo and its licensees will see a sharp sales rise this year, said Peter Main, vice president for marketing for Nintendo of America, the subsidiary of the Japanese company that is based in Redmond, Wash.
Retailers love Nintendo because it is a large profit sitting on a little shelf space. Nintendo's dictionary-sized plastic game console, which hooks up to a television set, sells for $99. Its hundreds of microchip-stuffed game cartridges, the size of a slice of bread, sell for up to $50. Game Boy, the hand-held Nintendo game console the size of a Sony Walkman, sells for $89.95; its tiny game cartridges cost a hefty $29.99.
If Nintendo slips, said Paul Valentine, a toy-industry analyst for Standard & Poor's, then makers of more traditional toys and board games will benefit. "We can put our hands on hard evidence that Nintendo is faltering," he said. Toy retailers are already sharply discounting Nintendo games. And 70 percent of American households with children 8 to 15 already have Nintendo, signaling market saturation.
Mr. Valentine estimates that when sales of Atari video games, Nintendo's predecessor, collapsed, traditional toy sales rose 50 percent in 1984 alone.
Despite such strong sellers as Playmate Toys' Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles, Hasbro's World Wrestling Federation action figures and Tyco's My Pretty Ballerina, many traditional-toy companies have reported earnings declines or losses in recent quarters. Cautious ordering and financial weakness at highly leveraged retailers exacerbated problems for the Nintendo wallflowers.
 
Aiming for Adults
 But Nintendo is not dying, according to Mr. Main. "There is a sense of whipping boy when people talk about Nintendo," he said. "Are we old news? Yes, we are. Are we continuing to show strength? Yes, we are."
Just about every youngster does have Nintendo, Mr. Main said, but that is why the company's new marketing pitch is aimed at adults, who already make up a third of Nintendo players. Even with its lower sales expectations and marked-down software, Nintendo will still sell significantly more units than last year. Mario, the little Italian plumber who stars in the most popular line of Nintendo games, gives the company a brand-name recognition that competitors like Sega and NEC do not have, he said.
If Nintendo seems to be everywhere, it is because about 29 million American homes are now noisy video arcades filled with Nintendo invalids. Five of the top 10 toys, according to the latest survey of Toy & Hobby World magazine, are Nintendo. The game console is still the nation's best-selling plaything.
But Atari had also emptied the wallets of millions of parents only to become a kind of metaphor for disaster gone ballistic. Immensely popular in the early 1980's, Atari reported huge losses in 1983 when a nation of temperamental tykes said suddenly, "Masters of the Universe, please." This year, several analysts see Nintendo but think Atari.
Nintendo's direct competitors are making headway with technologically advanced games and equipment. But Nintendo says it has a 93 percent share of the game market, Sega 3.8 percent, NEC 1.3 percent and Atari Games, 1.1 percent. Nintendo's rivals acknowledge that Nintendo has more than 90 percent of the software market. But they say Nintendo underestimates their shares and overestimates how many Nintendo games and consoles that retailers, heavy with inventory, will actually sell.
Nintendo has prospered, in part, by keeping tight control over its game software by manufacturing its own cartridges. In a move interpreted by some analysts as a response to slowing sales, Nintendo earlier this year said it would allow some licensees -- the scores of independent companies that write the hundreds of Nintendo game titles -- to make their own cartridges. Talks are still under way with licensees, and Nintendo has not cleared any cartridges in what it calls an "experimental" program.
Using the lowest of Nintendo of America's unit sales projections, the company and its licensees could post 1990 retail sales of $3.8 billion, up 40 percent from the level a year ago. That compares with perhaps a 47 percent rise projected earlier this year.
Nintendo of America did reduce its sales projections for its Nintendo game cartridges, which bring in about two-thirds of the company's revenue. But it raised projections for the Nintendo Entertainment System, the video game console, signaling more game cartridge sales in the future. Nintendo expects to sell 8.2 million consoles, up from its earlier estimate of 6 million, but down 11 percent from the 9.2 million a year earlier.
The company had expected to sell 70 million game cartridges, but revised that estimate to between 59 million and 65 million. That compares with 53 million unit sales in 1989.
The wide range for cartridges is due in part to uncertainty over old inventory, which has led to widespread discounting of Nintendo games. Like day-old bread, slower-selling Nintendo games have accumulated on store shelves. But that does not mean, Mr. Main argues, that customers are rejecting Nintendo, just as supermarket shoppers are not rejecting bread as a category when they pass over day-old loaves.
Since Nintendo's introduction in the United States in 1985, dozens of slower-selling titles have accumulated every year. There are now nearly 300 Nintendo video game titles but just 30 of those account for 50 percent of sales.
Even so, big chain stores, like Toys "R" Us, the world's largest toy store, have bought many slow-selling titles from distributors and smaller retailers. Nintendo studies, perhaps self-servingly, show that the more titles a store carries, the more it will sell for every game console.
Much of Nintendo's expected 1990 increase results from surging sales of Game Boy and its software. Nintendo expects to sell 4.4 million Game Boys, down from 5 million, projected earlier, but quadruple the level of a million last year, when it was introduced.
 
'You Could Get Old'
 Although Nintendo has reached market saturation among youngsters, especially boys aged 8 to 12, it finds that girls and young adults are becoming fans. From small percentages in the late 1980's, women and girls now make up 25 percent of all players. Even more striking is the percentage of players over 18, more than 32 percent.
Nintendo hopes to capture adults, both men and women. Game Boy's television commercials aim directly at this market. A recent commercial, by Foote Cone & Belding, San Francisco, shows suspendered professionals in their 30's playing Game Boy in their offices while vaguely classical music plays in the background. The tagline is: "You don't stop playing because you get old. But you could get old, if you stop playing."
As Game Boy this year stimulated lagging sales of its previous years' products, Nintendo hopes new machines from its Kyoto-based parent will raiset 1991 sales. Nintendo game consoles are 8-bit machines, a measure of computer memory and power, while new consoles recently introduced in Japan are 16-bit computers, with improved graphics and sound but at a hefty $169 price tag.
Whatever happens this year, Mr. Main said, Nintendo will live up to its name, which in Japanese means "Good things come from hard effort." Perhaps more appropriately, in view of this uncertain season, Nintendo can also be translated as "Leave it to heaven."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Steep Decline; Interests Rates Are a Factor

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar registered a sharp decline yesterday, shaken by an unemployment report from the United States that was worse than expected and by falling interest rates.
The dollar declined overseas and opened on a very weak note when trading shifted to domestic markets. The report that unemployment jumped two-tenths of a percentage point in November, to 5.9 percent, "got the market moving," said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.
The report offered virtually indisputable evidence that a recession has begun and prompted the Federal Reserve and a handful of banks to act to ease interest rates.
Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable and therefore reduce investors' need for dollars.
There were unconfirmed reports that the Federal Reserve had stepped in to support the dollar against the German mark, Mr. Flanagan said, adding that the dollar did move up after the rumors of intervention.
Traders are expecting interest rate differentials to become more unfavorable for the dollar, as United States rates decline while some important foreign rates hold steady. That would put further pressure on the dollar.
Also pushing the dollar down was an easing of tensions in the Persian Gulf conflict after the offer Thursday by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to release all hostages.
"The war premium was wiped out this week," said Kevin Lawrie, a vice president at the Bank of Boston in New York.
In New York, the dollar closed at 130.70 yen, down from 132.14 yen on Thursday. Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 132.17 yen, from 134.05 yen at Thursday's close. In London, it fell to 131.05 yen.
The British pound rose to $1.9510 in London, up from $1.9390 late Thursday. In New York, it cost $1.9535 to buy a pound, up from Thursday's $1.9400.
In New York trading against the German currency, the dollar fell to 1.4720 marks, down from 1.4885 on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.2532 Swiss francs, down from 1.2710; 4.9975 French francs, down from 5.0510; 1,110.00 Italian lire, down from 1,122.25, and 1.1580 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1621.

HEADLINE: U.S. Needs More Help in Gulf, Cheney Tells NATO.

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today that he had told the NATO allies that the United States would welcome more troops, supplies and help in transporting American forces to the Persian Gulf.
In response, NATO defense ministers meeting here made no promises to send more forces to the region, but agreed to continue giving the assistance they were already providing. 
Mr. Cheney said he had told the allies that the United States would welcome additional assistance, including heavy combat units, materiel and help in transportation. He said he had made no specific requests and received no specific promises.
"I made a general statement that we would be happy to have additional support," he said. "I did not come with specific requests and I am not now in a position of waiting for a response.
 
Deployment to Continue
 "I would expect that some governments would go back and say we'll reconsider."
Mr. Cheney also said that the news that Iraq might soon release all its foreign hostages would not hold up the deployment of 200,000 more American troops to the gulf by the end of January, or lead to any lessening of American resolve.
And, he said, even if the allies sent no more forces to the gulf, the United States would have enough to drive Iraq out of Kuwait if the decision was made to go to war.
NATO's Secretary General, Manfred Worner, said the response to the American invitation to continue or increase help was "basically favorable."
 
'Self-Sustaining' Combat Units
 The heavy combat units the United States would welcome are "units that are self-sustaining, and would add ground combat power, or additional air defense, or artillery," Mr. Cheney said. They would have to be prepared to operate under American command in the event of a decision to use force to drive Iraq out of Kuwait if it has not pulled out by the United Nations deadline of Jan. 15.
Mr. Cheney said he had not made any additional requests for money from the allies to help the United States meet the costs of the planned deployment of a force of over 400,000 Americans by the end of January.
Asked specifically if the Administration was satisfied with the contribution of Germany, which has sent no ground forces to the gulf, Mr. Cheney said:
"The United States clearly is playing the lead role, because we're able to. We have been very pleased with the support we've received from other countries. In particular, Germany has been very helpful in providing equipment, and is now helping to transport additional equipment and troops to the gulf."
 
New Kinds of Threats Seen
 Britain, which last month announced plans to bring its total deployment to the gulf to more than 30,000 troops by the end of January, and France, which has about 15,000 troops in the area, are the only NATO countries besides the United States to have sent significant numbers of combat soldiers.
The NATO communique after the two-day defense ministers' meeting acknowledged that, with the cold war over and the Warsaw Pact dying, the alliance had to be prepared to respond to new kinds of threats.
"The risks that allies now face in Europe arise principally not from the likelihood of deliberate aggression against allied territory, but rather as unforeseeable consequences of instabilities that might emerge in a period of rapid and widespread political, social and economic transformation," it said.
"Risks to alliance security can also arise from instability in East and Central Europe and from elsewhere," it said. NATO has not acted as a unit in the gulf crisis because its original charter, the Treaty of Washington, defined its area as the North Atlantic and Mediterranean.
 
Drafting a New Strategy
 The defense ministers discussed the progress of their alliance's attempt to draft a new strategy and design new tactics and force structures to preserve itself now that it has lost its traditional enemy, the Soviet Union, which no longer poses a threat of direct aggression. It is expected that the new strategy will be approved at a NATO summit late next spring.
As Mr. Worner put it, "NATO doesn't need a counterpart, or a foe, or an enemy. There are risks, there are instabilities, so you need insurance."
After the signature of the treaty on reduction of conventional arms in Europe in Paris last month, and despite plans to make "dramatic" reductions in the number of NATO nuclear warheads in Europe, the allied defense ministers still insisted today that they needed to maintain "for the foreseeable future an appropriate mix of nuclear and conventional forces, based in Europe, and kept up to date where necessary."
President Bush bowed to German wishes earlier this year and canceled the planned modernization of American short-range Lance nuclear missiles based in Germany. Gerhard Stoltenberg, the German Defense Minister, said at the meetings that he expected the alliance to give negotiators a mandate to eliminate all land-based nuclear missiles and nuclear artillery weapons in Europe in talks with the Soviet Union that are to start next year.

HEADLINE: Growth Rate Of Consumer Debt Slows

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Growth in consumer credit slowed to a seasonally adjusted $1.47 billion in October, the Federal Reserve reported today. Analysts said it was another sign of a weakening economy.
"That is minuscule, a very, very small increase," said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, a Washington management consulting firm. "It mostly reflects that we have a real softening in the kinds of purchases that people usually use credit for -- cars, furniture, appliances." 
 "Consumer spending is weak, and it's not surprising that consumer credit is weak," she said. "Consumers are much more leery about using credit given the business and economic environment."
The Federal Reserve said consumer credit grew at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, down from a revised 4.6 percent rate posted for September. The September rate was even slower than the 4.9 percent advance originally reported.
"Growth in revolving credit slowed in October from September," the central bank said. "Auto loans outstanding declined further in October as did loans for mobile homes."
Revolving, or credit card, debt increased $1.56 billion, at an annual rate of 8.6 percent. That was down from a 12.9 percent gain in September and a 13.3 percent advance a month earlier.
Automobile loans declined $785 million, at a 3.3 percent annual rate. Auto loans, which fell one-tenth of a percent in September, have declined every month this year except for January and March.
Ms. Shaber said the auto loan component provided more evidence that relatively strong car sales in October were attributable more to fleet sales than purchases by ordinary consumers.
Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose $880 million, a 5 percent rate, which was up slightly from 4.9 percent the previous month.
Borrowing for mobile homes fell $188 million, or a 10 percent rate, after declining 15.8 percent in September.
The various changes left total consumer debt at the end of October at $736.7 billion.

HEADLINE: New Zealand Media Move

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WELLINGTON, New Zealand, Dec. 7

 BODY:
The New Zealand Government said on Thursday that it would allow foreign companies to increase their holdings in radio and television companies.
The Communications Minister, Maurice Williamson, said legislation providing for up to 49.9 percent ownership by foreign companies in New Zealand broadcasters would be introduced in Parliament before the end of the month. The current ratios are a maximum of 15 percent foreign ownership in television companies and up to 25 percent in radio concerns. 
 The primary beneficiary of the move is expected to be the financially troubled TV3 network, a private company now in receivership. The network, begun a year ago as the first private competition to the two stations run by the state-owned Television New Zealand, attracts 15 percent of the viewing audience.
NBC of the United States owns 7.5 percent of TV3. It had reduced its stake from 15 percent. TV3 reported a $28 million loss for the year ended on March 31.

Fleet-Norstar To Cut 500 Jobs

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., Dec. 7

 BODY:
Fleet-Norstar Financial Group plans to cut about 500 jobs by the end of the year, an official of the banking company said today.
The layoffs will be scattered among Fleet's 1,000 offices in 40 states but will primarily affect workers in New England and New York, a bank spokesman, Robert W. Lougee Jr., said.
The cutbacks "range from the top to the bottom of the organization," he said. Some workers have already been notified.
Fleet posted a small profit in the third quarter and has been profitable for the first nine months of the year. The Providence-based bank-holding company attributed most of the layoffs to the recession in the the Northeast.
Other reductions were part of a continuing consolidation since Fleet Financial Group merged with Norstar Bankcorp of Albany in 1988. Shortly after the merger, Fleet-Norstar employed 19,500 people. Today, it employs 18,000, Mr. Lougee said. The work force reduction was expected to save the company about $25 million.

HEADLINE: Crude Up 18 Cents, to $26.58, But Is Down $2.27 for Week

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices showed little change yesterday as traders paused to wonder what crude might do next, after a dramatic weeklong slide based on hopes for peace in the Persian Gulf.
"When the market moves like this one has, it tends to get a little bit overdone and then moves back," said Brian Tagler, an oil broker with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. 
 Crude for January delivery rose 18 cents, to $26.58 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
For the week, oil was down $2.27 a barrel for next-month delivery. After a big fall of $4.06 a barrel on Nov. 30, this week's losses dropped oil into a price range it had not seen since August, the month Iraq invaded Kuwait.
Crude's fall also brought unleaded gasoline futures down to August levels. The dive began last week when President Bush offered to hold top-level diplomatic sessions with the Iraqis.
Oil kept falling this week, first when Iraq accepted the offer, and later when President Saddam Hussein of Iraq announced plans to free all his hostages.
 
A Little Correction
 Oil traders said the market seemed due for its its slight bounce up yesterday, and some were surprised it did not rise even more.
"We came down awfully fast over the past couple of days and this is a little bit of a correction," said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an energy analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J. "Even though there's new peace hopes, you have to look at them with a grain of salt."
Futures contracts for home heating oil and unleaded gasoline were mixed, though none of them moved by as much as a cent a gallon. Some traders were selling heating oil contracts and buying unleaded gasoline contracts just because gasoline seemed like a relative bargain at about 12 cents a gallon cheaper than the heating oil, Mr. Blakeslee said.
Heating oil closed down 0.54 cent at 79.17 cents a gallon for January delivery. Unleaded gasoline was down 0.13 cent at 66.47 cents a gallon for January delivery.
For the week, unleaded gasoline fell 11.11 cents a gallon for next-month delivery, while home heating oil fell 6.70 cents a gallon.
Natural gas, which is not directly affected by fears of war in the Persian Gulf, also showed little direction yesterday. The January delivery contract fell 0.1 cent, to $2.350 per 1,000 cubic feet. For the week, gas dropped 9.5 cents for January delivery.

Platinum Prices Off Sharply After Unemployment Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Precious metals continued their slide on the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, paced by a sharp drop in platinum prices that was caused by a jump in United States unemployment.
Silver prices were also hard hit, at one point tumbling to contract lows. Both platinum and silver are heavily used in industry. 
 The selloff in platinum came after the release of unemployment figures by the United States Labor Department showing joblessness in November reached a three-year high of 5.9 percent.
 
January Platinum at $413.40
 Platinum settled $7.90 to $8.50 lower, with the contract for delivery in January at $413.40 an ounce.
Peter Cardillo, an analyst with Jesup, Josephthal & Company in New York, said the silver market was also sharply affected by the decline in employment.
Platinum is used in the catalytic converters of automobiles and in jewelry. Silver is a luxury item and is used in the photography industry.
"If you have a recessionary atmosphere, it dampens the future prospects of the metal," Mr. Cardillo said.
The unemployment figures gave some support to the gold market. Gold is usually an investment haven in times of economic uncertainty. But the imminent release of hostages in Iraq and the resulting perceptions of peace weighed on gold futures, analysts said.
Gold was $1.10 to $1.90 lower, with the active February contract at $372.10 an ounce. The near-month December contract fell $1.40 an ounce, to $370.30. Silver was 6.2 to 7.8 cents lower, with December at $4.055 an ounce.
Recessionary fears also forced copper prices lower on the Comex.
Copper was 1.45 to 3.10 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in December at $1.1015 a pound.
Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower on the Chicago Board of Trade as a lack of news on United States aid to the Soviet Union took its toll on the market.
The market has been awaiting an announcement that the United States will extend about $1.2 billion in export credits to the Soviet Union so that nation can buy United States farm products. But nothing has come of talks between Soviet officials and the United States Agriculture Department.
Analysts also noted that the market was hurt by the failure of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks in Brussels.
Wheat futures showed gains on aggressive buying by commercial houses and by Egypt's purchase of 200,000 metric tons of soft white wheat under the export bonus program, said Paul Sylvester, an analyst with Gerald Inc. in Chicago.

HEADLINE: 1-900-I-LOVE/I-HATE-FLORIO-MAKE-ME-RICH

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNION CITY, N.J.

 BODY:
A 16-year-old high school student has found a way to channel some of the heated public debate over Gov. Jim Florio and his $2.8 billion tax program into a money maker: a 900 telephone number for people who want to say whether Mr. Florio should be recalled, or given a chance.
The $2 it costs each caller to dial the number and select one of two extensions that registers the votes for or against the Governor's program pays for the call and yields about $1 to Lorraine Buschhoff, a junior at St. Aloysius Academy in Jersey City. 
 "I'm going to save some of the money for college, and donate the rest to a local homeless charity," she said. "I haven't figured out how much will go to each."
More than 200 callers have registered votes in the 10 days the number has been available. "So far, the sentiment is running 3 to 1 for a recall," Miss Buschhoff said.
 
Clothing for Homeless
 In June Miss Buschhoff was among 324 young people across the state to receive a Young Citizen's Award from Senator Bill Bradley for making "significant contributions to their communities."
Miss Buschhoff and her parents collected clothing three years ago from the more than 400 families who live in their apartment building in Union City and given it to the homeless at the Journal Square PATH Station in Jersey City and at Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan. She has also sold candy and stuffed animals to raise pocket money and funds for organizations for the homeless and the blind.
"I don't get an allowance, so I had to find ways to raise money," she said. "The clothing distribution and the donations also give me a warm feeling because I am able to do something for others."
Jon Shure, Mr. Florio's communications director, said he was glad she had found a way to raise money from the debate.
 
We Said It Would Help
 "We said our program would be good for the economy," he said. "But from the consumer's standpoint, it would make more sense to spend 25 cents for a stamp and write to the governor directly."
He also said 900-number telephone surveys do not really measure public sentiment on important issues. "People who are against it are much more likely to spend the $2," he said.
Using 900 numbers to tap the emotion generated by taxes appears to have become almost a cottage industry.
Last month, after a complaint by Mr. Florio's office, a number run by a Cranford resident was shut off. Mr. Shure said the call cost $6 and callers "were told the money would help impeach Mr. Florio, when it can't, and the message contained gross misinformation that approached fraud."
 
Father's First Customer
 The message said Mr. Florio was planning to raise the current 7 percent sales tax to 10 percent and to disarm police departments.
Miss Buschhoff got the idea to start the telephone poll when her father started a new business leasing 900 numbers.
The phone number, (900) 321-0001 (she was her father's first customer), is available 24 hours a day. Callers are told to press one extension if they agree that "Governor Florio should be recalled for his tax increase," and another extension if they believe "Governor Florio had no choice in raising taxes and should be given a chance."
Sister Joan Repka, principal of St. Aloysius, said Miss Buschhoff's latest venture has brought reporters and a cable television crew to the school. "Everyone is aware of the telephone poll," she said, "although the students ask her, 'Why are you doing this?' and 'Who's Florio?' -- as sophisticated as high school students are."

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
Democrats Say Iraqi Move Won't Turn Debate

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Congressional Democrats who have been critical of President Bush's Persian Gulf policy said today that their views had not been altered by President Saddam Hussein's decision to release the foreign hostages in Iraq and Kuwait.
"It doesn't affect the debate," said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee. "Democrats like me are not going to stop questioning the soundness of his policy." 
 Mr. Biden and other prominent Democrats in both the House and the Senate have argued that economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after Mr. Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in August should be given more time to work before any resort to military force.
Both Mr. Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d insisted on Thursday that the Iraqi decision to free the hostages proved that the threat of imminent war was finally beginning to produce concessions from Mr. Hussein.
 
Hostages 'Becoming a Liability'
 But many Democrats said today that the decision was more likely the result of a combination of factors, including the sanctions, and that in terms of the future course of gulf policy, it probably did not matter much any way.
"I think it became clear to Saddam Hussein that there was no more mileage in having hostages and that they were becoming a liability," Mr. Biden said. "I think he became convinced that they would not slow the momentum for a siege against him, whether it was military or economic."
Senator Sam Nunn f Georgia, who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee, echoed that view, saying, "To me, it doesn't matter why he's done it."
Mr. Nunn, who has been critical of the President's decision to send additional American forces to the gulf, said the military option has been credible since October, when the initial contingent of 230,000 American troops sent to Saudi Arabia reached full strength.
He said that while it was impossible to determine Mr. Hussein's motivations for deciding to free the foreigners, the most important factor may have been Mr. Baker's statement that there would be no war if the Iraqi leader complied fully with a resolution adopted last week by the United Nations Security Council. That resolution authorizes the use of force after Jan. 15 if Iraq does not leave Kuwait.
"I at some point will support the use of military force in Kuwait," Mr. Nunn said. "I have said that all along. The question is whether that is wise at this time. I don't think it's vital that Kuwait be liberated with 95 percent American forces and 95 percent American casualties between now and February."
"If there is a war, we ought to be able to look at the family member of somebody who gets killed and say it was worth it, and we exhausted all the other options," he said.
The split over gulf policy has taken on an increasingly partisan tone in Congress over the last several weeks, highlighted by the angry exchanges between liberal Democrats and Administration officials during hearings conducted by Mr. Nunn's panel and the Foreign Relations Committee. But there are also divisions within Democratic ranks.
Representative Stephen J. Solarz, a Brooklyn Democrat who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that while party colleagues who are critical of the President's policies had received most of the attention, he and at least half a dozen other House Democrats had serious doubts about the effect of economic sanctions on Iraq or their utility in dislodging Mr. Hussein from Kuwait.

HEADLINE: Prime Rate Is Cut to 9 3/4% By a Few Regional Banks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
A few regional banks cut their prime lending rates yesterday to 9 3/4 percent from 10 percent, a move that is expected to spread to other banks, although analysts are not sure when.
The cuts are a sign that the Federal Reserve's recent moves to ease monetary policy and reduce short-term interest rates in the financial markets are beginning to spread through the economy. 
 The prime rate, which has been stable at 10 percent since January, when it fell from 10 1/2 percent, is a benchmark for rates charged on loans to small and medium-sized businesses. It is also used at some banks to determine rates on home equity and credit card loans.
 
'Little Beneficial Impact'
 "So far the Fed's moves to lower rates have had a relatively little beneficial impact on rates at which individuals and smaller businesess can borrow, which is one reason why I expect further easing by the Fed," said Dana Johnson, an economist at the First National Bank of Chicago.
To stimulate the economy, and encourage further cuts in the prime rate, Mr. Johnson expects the Fed to reduce the interest rate for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market to 7 percent by the year's end, and that it might also cut the discount rate it charges on loans made to banks. Since July, the Fed has reduced the overnight loan rate in the Federal funds market from 8 1/4 percent to 7 1/4 percent but has left the discount rate unchanged at 7 percent since February 1989, when it was raised from 6 1/2 percent.
 
 Move by New Jersey Bank
 The largest bank to reduce the prime was the First Fidelity Bancorporation, Lawrenceville, N.J., the 23d-largest banking company in the country. Officials at First Fidelity declined to comment, but analysts noted that the lower rate would surely be noticed by large New York banks that compete with the New Jersey bank for loans to midsized businesses in the New York area.
Robert G. Wilmers, chairman of the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, a Buffalo bank that also reduced its rate, said the lower rate was justified "by growing indications that the economy is soft, and the continued moves by the Fed to push rates down."
Large banks have been slower than normal to reduce the prime rate because they are trying to earn as much interest as possible to compensate for heavy losses on bad real estate loans and a need to pay higher than normal interest rates to large depositors who are worried about the health of the banking system.

The holiday season has arrived in Albany, and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo wants to give everyone in the state work force some extra time off. But little joy has greeted the news: These vacation days would be mandatory furloughs, without pay, a move proposed by the Governor to help close a $1 billion state budget deficit for the current year.
 Legislative leaders, meanwhile, are promoting an alternative plan under which many workers would still work, but not collect some of their pay until the 21st century. Under this plan, known as a lag payroll, state employees would be required to defer a week's worth of their wages until they retire.
Either way, state workers are feeling squeezed. 
 "People are in an uproar," Richard Waterhouse, a keypunch operator for the Department of Taxation and Finance, said on his lunch hour recently outside the department's sprawling headquarters. "They can call it whatever they want, but this thing basically amounts to a pay cut."
Some state workers are getting even worse news. Pink slips have already been sent to about 700 Department of Correctional Services employees, and the Governor plans to lay off up to 10,000 people within the next year and a half and eliminate thousands of other jobs through attrition.
Beyond the people most immediately affected, the budget plan has set off alarms throughout Albany, which so far has been spared the worst effects of the Northeast's economic downturn. That insulation has stemmed in large part from the state government's steadiness as an employer; but now there is wide concern here that layoffs of thousands of people in the Albany area could throw the city into an economic tailspin.
"The city of Albany has been about as recession-proof as you could get," said Albany's Mayor, Thomas M. Whalen 3d. But Albany is still something of a company town, the Mayor noted, "and the company is in trouble."
 
 The Mood at Ground Zero
 The various budget cuts proposed by Mr. Cuomo recently would affect every level of state government, and have stirred wide resentment.
"We're the backbone of the state," Roger Stevens, a 50-year-old highway equipment operator for the Department of Transportation, said as he helped ready a snowplow for winter duty the other day at a maintenance shop in an Albany suburb. "They should cut at the fat cats, not at us -- but this plan goes after everybody."
But while the cuts will be felt across the state, ground zero for any attempt to pare the state bureaucracy may well be the Gov. W. Averell Harriman State Office Campus, a huge cluster of squat office buildings a few miles west of the Capitol that houses everything from the State Troopers' Academy to the Department of Civil Service.
Governor Cuomo has repeatedly emphasized that the furloughs are the best possible way to "share the pain" of tough fiscal times and that the alternative would be even more layoffs.
But some state workers at the complex see other factors at work.
"Who's kidding who?" said 61-year-old John Birnbach, who has worked in the state printing plant for 23 years. "The Governor's doing this because he's running for President of the United States. He's trying to show he can be a big tough guy."
Others acknowledge that the state is in fact facing dire fiscal problems, but they are resisting the furloughs and the deferred-pay plans anyway. "There's a feeling that by going along you will just be setting yourself up for a sucker punch," said Isaac Bracey, a compensation analyst for the Department of Civil Service. "First they furlough you, then they'll lay you off anyway."
 
 No Laughing Matter
 Bob Mason has started going easy on his state-worker jokes, a sure sign of the sensitivity of the budget cuts.
Mr. Mason, a WPYX-FM radio announcer who hosts the Albany area's most popular morning show, usually peppers his program with skits and jokes that poke fun at the state work force. One long-running segment features a "900" party line for fictitious state workers, who spend much of the day calling in to complain that they were stumped by the day's "Jumble" puzzle or a crosssword.
The jokes (What's yellow and blue and sleeps six? A Department of Transportation truck. What did the state unions use for a float in this year's Thanksgiving Day parade? A giant loafer.) are largely gone these days, replaced instead by skits that liken Mario Cuomo to a George Steinbrenner figure, blaming the players for his team's problems.
"We've been giving state workers the business for years," Mr. Mason said in an interview. "Usually people just take it all in fun. But it's a tough time right now."
 
 Less Cheer for Holidays
 The Governor and legislative leaders are still huddling over the budget-cutting proposals, but officials here say that either the furloughs or the lag payroll will almost surely wind up as part of the final package. Sensing the inevitability of losing a week's pay this year, and knowing that banks and utility companies are not in the habit of letting their own bills "lag," many state workers said they were already holding back on holiday gifts.
"There's a lot of window-shopping going on this year," said Rick Eaglestone, the manager of the Northway Mall in the Albany suburb of Colonie. "What we're seeing is people coming in and looking at something, then coming back and looking again, then coming back and looking some more. It seems like last year, they'd just come in and buy."
State workers aren't the only ones caught in a budget crunch here. The gleaming 15,000-seat Knickerbocker Arena, built by Albany County to help revitalize the downtown area and perhaps even lure a major-league sports franchise someday, recently got stuck with a $250,000 bill from the state for chilled water that it uses for air conditioning and icemaking. That figure, included as part of the Governor's deficit-cutting plan, is about three times what the arena managers said they had agreed to pay. State officials said the initial cost estimate the state provided had simply been too low.
The higher bill adds to the county's anticipated debt payment for the arena, known as the Knick, of about $5.3 million this year, or $1 million more than anticipated revenues.

HEADLINE: Sears Reduces Prices Amid Lagging Sales

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Two weeks into a disappointing holiday season and two years after introducing a discount pricing policy, Sears, Roebuck & Company is cutting prices again, starting its after-Christmas clearance sale now.
Reacting to sales chilled by a possible recession and tensions in the Middle East, the nation's largest retailer is slashing prices on apparel and durable goods like washers and offering zero percent financing on some product lines including home electronics and furniture. 
 The latest Sears sales strategy follows by nearly two years the introduction by the company of a brand-name "everyday low price" strategy to compete with large discounters like K Mart and Wal-Mart. That strategy, of course, implied that there would be no sales.
Some analysts have said the move confused consumers and did nothing to address a more fundamental Sears problem: that it is a high-cost retailer that tries to sell too many product lines to too many kinds of customers.
"We are moving as quickly as we can to deal with conditions right now," Perry D. Chlan, a Sears spokesman, said about the pre-Christmas sale.
Some marketing consultants expressed doubt about the move, saying it would further cloud the Sears image and would not help in the retailer's struggle to regain customers.
"They are undermining their image for quality," said John Morton, senior vice president of the Total Research Corporation, a market research firm that analyzes consumer perceptions of brand names.
"Oh boy, it tends to communicate that they're in a lot of trouble," said Jack Trout, president of Trout & Ries, marketing consultants in Greenwich, Conn. "Every other retailer has a pencil and they can mark down stuff, too, if they have to."
Securities analysts, quickly revising their earnings estimates for Sears, project that 1990 profit may be off by as much as two-thirds from last year's $1.45 billion, or $4.12 a share. Sears said earlier this week that store sales dropped 1.6 percent in the four weeks ended Dec. 1. Other large retailers like Carter Hawley Hale, J. C. Penney and May Department Stores also reported sales declines in November.
At all its 850 stores, Sears is moving up its traditional after-Christmas sale on apparel to the period between now and Christmas Eve, reducing prices 20 percent to 40 percent.
On certain days, Sears will reduce from $5 to $500 the prices on brand-name merchandise like washers and driers, vacuum cleaners and microwave ovens. On Dec. 11-12, the company will offer zero percent financing on goods like home electronics, furniture and jewelry.
To encourage early shopping, Sears today will begin to offer 10 percent discount coupons to shoppers who buy between 8 and 10 A.M. as well as other "bonus bucks" coupons at other times.
The new sales strategy will be heavily promoted in print and on broadcasts with the slogan "After-Christmas prices just in time for Christmas." But Mr. Chlan, the Sears spokesman, said the company would not increase ad spending.
When Sears initiated discount pricing two years ago, it also switched from emphasizing its private-label brands like Craftsman hardware and Kenmore appliances to a "Brand Central" theme with national brand-name merchandise.
Some analysts say that for years Sears confused consumers by being a full-price merchandiser of unglamorous goods like refrigerators and children's clothes. Then it switched to being more of a discount merchandiser of prestige goods from Sony, RCA and General Electric.
Mr. Morton of Total Research said his consumer surveys indicated shoppers ranked Sears with Goodyear tires and Holiday Inn hotels. They did not associate Sears with names like Sony or Cuisinart. "Those images are just not compatible," he said.
Like other department stores, Sears was hurt by being a high-cost general merchandiser at a time when specialty retailers, like the Limited apparel stores and Circuit City consumer electronics stores, offered more variety at lower prices.
In addition, the modern shopping mall became another Sears competitor. With its range of specialty stores, it became a kind of extended department store.
Securities analysts, who have been slashing Sears earnings estimates throughout a weak retailing year, were quick yesterday to cut their projections further.
William N. Smith of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company reduced his estimate to $3 a share for the year, down from a November estimate of $3.25. He said profits could go as low as $2.80 if real estate profits from the Coldwell Banker unit did not materialize.

HEADLINE: Rates Fall After Move By the Fed

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Interest rates plunged yesterday after the Federal Reserve loosened credit by injecting funds into the banking system. The central bank's action came a few hours after the Government reported that unemployment in November had surged to a three-year high of 5.9 percent.
The yield on the Government's benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue due August 2020, plunged to 8.17 percent in response. This was the lowest yield on the long bonds since mid-January of this year, and compared with the 8.32 percent of the day before and 8.39 percent of a week ago. The bonds, which are the most sensitive to inflation, were offered late in the day at at 106 10/32, up an extraordinary 1 21/32.
A few regional banks reduced their prime lending rates to 9.75 percent from 10 percent, a move that is expected to spread to other banks, although analysts are not sure when. The largest bank to act was the First Fidelity Bancorporation in Lawrenceville, N.J. [Page 37.] 
 Credit market analysts said they did not expect bigger banks to fall into line anytime soon. Philip Braverman, senior vice president and chief economist at the DKB Securities Corporation, the domestic arm of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Tokyo, the world's largest bank, said, "The bigger banks are hurting too much to do anything that would reduce their profit margins, certainly not before they are to issue their year-end reports in a few weeks."
 
Effect on T-Bills
 Changes in Fed policy have their most immediate impact on 90-day Treasury bills, and by late in the day the discount rate on those bills had dropped 11 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 6.90 percent, its lowest level since early August 1988. The rate on six-month bills fell 12 basis points, to 6.79 percent, and the one-year bills lost 12 basis points, at 6.69 percent.
Because any economic developments that reduce the likelihood of a rise in interest rates and inflation benefit the fixed-income market, prices of all Treasury debt issues began to advance soon after the Government reported the unemployment data at 8:30 A.M. Three hours later the Fed added $1.5 billion of reserves to the banking system.
This caused the bedrock cost of credit, the funds rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans, to fall to 7 1/16 percent, from 7 1/4 percent at the time of the Fed's action. The funds had traded at 7 3/8 percent the day before. It was the third time the Fed had intervened to reduce this key interest rate since late October, when the funds traded between 7.75 percent and 8 percent.
"What provoked the Fed to act was the November numbers were far worse than they appear at first glance," Mr. Braverman of DKB Securities said. "A truer and sadder picture emerges when one looks at the household tally of jobless and not just the non-farm payroll numbers."
The payroll data showed that 267,000 non-farm jobs were lost in November, worse than the drop of 178,000 in October. These figures include those holding one or more part-time jobs, Mr. Braverman noted. The household tally put the loss of jobs last month at 405,000, almost double the 218,000 jobs lost in October.
 
 Doubt on Major Banks
 Although Mr. Braverman expects the Fed to ease credit further this month, probably after the central bank's policy-making Open Market Committee meets on Dec. 17, he said that he doubted that the major banks would cut their prime rates in the foreseeable future.
Eugene J. Sherman, senior vice president and chief economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, said: "There will only be a cut in the prime at the majors after the Fed cuts its discount rate, which is now 7 percent. Even then, most banks will be reluctant to cut their prime because so much of their consumer lending, including home equity loans and credit cards, are linked to their prime. And consumer lending is the brightest area of the banking business today."
Mr. Sherman noted that the Fed's discount rate to member banks was no longer the powerful tool it was a decade or so ago because banks have developed other sources of funds. Still, he pointed out, "the Fed has to make a bold statement to revive both consumer and business confidence, and cutting the discount rate would be a good way to do this."
William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, said: "The Fed usually prefers its discount rate to be at least 50 basis points below the funds rate. Regardless of what one may think of the discount rate in today's environment, the Street still thinks the Fed would like it that way. But it is doubtful a discount rate cut would affect the prime. The major banks have too much riding on their prime's linkage to consumer credit, including mortgages, to want to lower it."
 
Another Move Discounted
 As for the current consensus in the credit markets, Mr. Sullivan said that "the Street has already discounted another Fed easing in the next few days, largely because of the Fed's dramatic reversal in posture between Thursday and today."
Among domestic issues competitive with those of Japan and Germany, the yield on the Treasury's 8.5 percent long notes of November 2000 rose a full point, or $10 for each $1,000 of face value, to 103 8/32, while the yield dropped to 8.01 percent, from 8.23 percent a week ago. The yield on Japan's 10-year long bonds fell to 7.21 percent, from 7.43 percent a week ago, and the yield on Germany's comparable long bonds slipped to 8.77 percent from 8.82 percent.
The Treasury announced that its regular monthly auction of one-year bills would be held next Thursday. The amount offered was set at $11.75 billion.

HEADLINE: A Ford-VW Mini-Van for Europe

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company and Volkswagen A. G. of Germany are nearing agreement on a joint venture for European production of mini-vans. The vehicles' popularity is growing rapidly in Western Europe.
Volkswagen's supervisory board approved plans for the factory on Nov. 16, and the tentative agreement will go to Ford's board of directors next week. The British newspaper The Financial Times said the plant was expected to have a production capacity of 150,000 to 200,000 vehicles a year and could involve an investment of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Ford and Volkswagen would not comment on those figures. 
 A leading choice for the plant's site is Portugal. Its Government has promised to provide financial support for the project, but such assistance would require the approval of the European Community.
 
 Earlier Latin Venture
 In 1987, Ford and Volkswagen merged their operations in Brazil and Argentina to form Autolatina, 51 percent of which is owned by Volkswagen and 49 percent by Ford.
About 82,000 mini-vans -- small vans that handle like cars -- are expected to be sold in Western Europe this year, or 18.8 percent more than were sold in 1989, according to DRI/ McGraw-Hill. The economics forecasting firm said annual sales could increase to 320,000 in 1995.
Ford predicts that the market could grow to 475,000 by 1998. It currently sells about 1,000 Aerostar mini-van imports a year in Europe.
Mini-vans were introduced in the United States by the Chrysler Corporation in 1983. This year industry sales in the United States will total about 800,000, predicted David B. Healy, a New York-based analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities, the British brokerage.
In a telephone interview from Wolfsburg, Germany, Ortwin Witzel, a Volkswagen spokesman, said: "We saw what happened in the United States. It gives you an idea of what could happen in Europe." Although Volkswagen does not currently sell a mini-van, it does sell a passenger version of its Transporter commercial van. Known as the Caravelle, it is being introduced in Europe.
 
 Production Limits
 Carol Thomas, an analyst at DRI/ McGraw-Hill, said current industry sales of mini-vans would probably be larger in Europe if more were available. She noted that there was limited production capacity in Western Europe, and several countries have quotas on Japanese imports, which hold 29 percent of the mini-van market.
Renault, the French company, has been the pioneer in mini-vans in Western Europe, and its Espace mini-van is the market leader with a 43 percent share. Factory expansions this year increased its production capability to 55,000 units a year.
Other companies are following suit. Earlier this year, Chrysler formed a joint venture with Steyr-Daimler-Puch Fahrzeugtechnik, an Austrian company, to build mini-vans in Austria. The plant is to go into operation next spring, with an initial annual output of 25,000 vehicles. That is eventually expected to rise to 125,000. Chrysler expects to sell 15,000 Voyager mini-vans imports in Europe this year, up from 8,800 last year.
 
 Peugeot-Fiat Venture
 France's Peugeot and Italy's Fiat have a joint venture and hope to begin mini-van production in their countries by late 1993. They expect to make 50,000 to 60,000 units a year by the mid-1990's.
The General Motors Corporation is considering plans for mini-van production in Europe, where it now has no mini-van sales, a spokesman said.
Ford has no joint ventures in European car manufacturing, although Nissan has agreed to produce a four-wheel-drive vehicle for Ford at the Japanese company's plant in Spain beginning in the spring of 1993.
Ford and Mazda, the Japanese company in which Ford has a 25 percent stake, had been talking about a European joint venture in compact cars. But in an interview in October, L. Lindsey Halstead, chairman of Ford of Europe, said, "We aren't at the stage where we've got any kind of firm proposal or even a glimmer of one." Analysts believe that Ford is not eager to help Mazda establish a manufacturing presence in Europe.
 
 VW Is Market Leader
 In the first 10 months of 1990 Ford of Europe sold 1.3 million cars in Western Europe and had 11.6 percent of the market, ranking fifth, just behind General Motors, whose share was 11.9 percent. The market leader was Volkswagen, with 15.2 percent, followed by Fiat and Peugeot.
Last year, Ford's European automotive operations had a net income of $1.19 billion on sales of $21.23 billion. They accounted for 37.5 percent of the company's worldwide automotive earnings and 25.6 percent of revenues.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
Returning to Cash In Uncertain Time

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
For uneasy investors, it may make sense to lighten up on portfolio holdings before the end of the year, combining tax and market strategies.
"With the continued uncertainties over war and recession and job stability, a lot of people are interested in cash right now," said George E. L. Barbee, executive director of personal financial services for Price Waterhouse. "We're finding that mindset." And comments from market professionals show there is good reason for that view. 
 Edward A. Taber 3d, director of T. Rowe Price's taxable bond division, said at his firm's briefing this week on the 1991 investment and economic outlook, "The more risk you took, the less reward you got" in 1990, and that could continue early next year. So far this year money market funds have had a 6.5 percent return, he noted, while high-yield funds have lost 11.5 percent, and long Treasury funds have returned only 1.3 percent.
Paul W. Boltz, the firm's economist, saw a mild recession, beginning in this quarter and lasting two or three quarters, with a slight drop in short-term interest rates. He expects the Fed to tighten credit as recovery sets in, but he sees an outside possibility of a severe recession, should war break out in the Persian Gulf or a major bank fail.
John H. Laporte, president of Price's New Horizons and New America Growth funds, concurred, saying, "We think the bear market has farther to go." But he added, "The stock market as usual will begin to recover well before the economy." He added that small growth stocks, which have been battered this year, could lead a cyclical recovery in 1991, so he advised investors to focus on growth companies with high financial returns and assured earnings growth.
Investors should inventory their portfolios,determining paper losses and gains, and identify candidates for sale, Mr. Barbee said, and then decide whether to move into a cash position like a Treasury bill or C.D. or to reinvest in the market.
If a portfolio has both losses and gains, an investor can use the losses to offset the gains, so that cash is raised without incurring tax liability on the gains. Also, net capital losses of up to $3,000 can offset ordinary income, so from a tax standpoint, he said, "it makes sense to admit to yourself you were wrong and sell."
"It is paramount to run some calculations before the end of the year and see if there is an A.M.T. situation," Mr. Barbee added, referring to the alternative minimum tax, which is intended to make sure that no taxpayer with substantial income avoids taxation.
The rate is 21 percent, compared with a normal 28 percent or 33 percent, but a number of tax breaks that are allowed in regular tax calculations are taken away. As a result, those who are snared have a larger taxable income and fewer deductions than they would have under regular rules.
The reason to see if there is an alternative tax liability is that the three things most likely to subject a taxpayer to it are commonly considered inyear-end planning. They are: sizable state and local taxes, the exercise of incentive stock options and the donation of appreciated property to charity. The timing of these items is often the opposite for regular taxpayers and those subject to the alternative tax.
For regular taxpayers, appreciated securities, for example, may be deducted at market value -- and making such a contribution at year-end can be an effective way to help a favorite charity and lower one's tax bill. But for those subject to the alternative tax, the deduction is based on the original cost. Therefore, if a taxpayer were to be subject to the alternative tax this year but not next year, it might be a good idea to delay the donation until January.
As for gifts of valuable artwork, the new tax law provides a one-year window in 1991 in which donors will not be subject to the alternative tax.
Sam Radin, president of the National Madison Group, which advises lawyers on tax and estate planning, noted that for regular high-income taxpayers it might be advisable to wait until early January to fulfill a 1990 charitable pledge because the deduction will be worth more in 1991, when it will be taxed at 31.93 percent after the phase-out of all exemptions, compared with 28 percent in 1990.
"The value of a $100,000 charitable deduction in 1990 is $28,000; in 1991 it is $31,930," he said. The difference "represents a 14.04 percent net after-tax return -- with no risk."
 
'What If' Tax Strategies
 Probably the fastest way to try "what if" tax strategies is to use income tax software in a personal computer. Turbo Tax from Chip Soft, which has been the best-selling program for I.B.M. and compatible machines in recent years, has also introduced a Macintosh version this year.
Headstart versions are now on retail shelves. A big plus for this program is that it has 1991 tax rates as well as 1990's, so that in the planning mode users can see what the effect would be of recognizing income or taking a deduction this year versus next year, for example.

Bed-Stuy, Do or Die. For Real. 911.

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
The Bedford-Stuyvesant Volunteer Ambulance Corps officially began on Feb. 23, 1989. Within 24 hours, its president, James Robinson, and a colleague spotted a fire in an abandoned building and saved 10 people. Within 48 hours, volunteers had delivered a baby.
The pace never slackened. Drug-related violence devastates this poor Brooklyn neighborhood. People living here are particularly susceptible to hypertension and resultant heart problems. Medical care, at best, is patchy. 
 "We're like an oasis in the middle of the desert," said Mr. Robinson, a gruff, bearlike man known to one and all as Rocky. Like all volunteers, Mr. Robinson, 50 years old, wears a beret decorated with the corps patch of red, green and black, the colors of black liberation.
He tells astonishing stories in the tone of a jaded veteran chronicling a ruthless war. Once he intercepted a man running wildly down a sidewalk. His carotid artery had been cut and blood spurted out. Mr. Robinson applied pressure and the bleeding abated.
Just then, the man who had cut him walked brazenly past. The wounded man jerked away and charged the attacker. He beat him soundly, then turned to Mr. Robinson. "Please finish saving me," he said.
Mr. Robinson thinks the man lived only because his blood pressure remained strong because he was so agitated and high on crack. "Me and you would have been dead," he said.
In a city where services have so deteriorated, citizens feel compelled to take matters into their own hands. Volunteer ambulance corps are a case in point: there are now 32. The idea is to augment, not replace Emergency Medical Services.
 The Bedford-Stuy vesant effort began because the need was so immense. Re search by Mr. Robin son and Joe Perez, vice president and co-founder of the corps, had shown that three-quarters of all emergency calls for medi cal assistance in New York City came from predominantly minority communities.
 But an overburdened Emergency Medical Services was taking as long as 15 minutes to arrive. The corps has cut its own response time to an average of four minutes. It answers an average of 350 calls a month. Mr. Robinson, who like Mr. Perez is an E.M.S. supervisor, said a salutary spinoff is that city ambulances, sparked by competition, now arrive almost as fast.
In a community where unemployment is vast, another benefit is that scores have been trained as emergency medical technicians and found jobs with the E.M.S. or private ambulance services. This has begun to solve a problem that began in the mid-1970's when E.M.S. made service in a volunteer corps a hiring requirement. There were none in minority neighborhoods until the Bedford-Stuyvesant corps.
Mr. Robinson recoiled at the inequity, but knew the time for self-help had come. "We should stop blaming the other guy for our problems," he said. "A lot are self-inflicted."
An uphill fight. The corps began in an abandoned apartment building without electricity or running water. It didn't even have an ambulance. Members listened to the police, fire and E.M.S. radio bands and raced to respond first in a car carrying first-aid equipment.
The original ambulance was a gift from the Williamsburg Volunteer Ambulance Corps, which also sold the corps a 55-foot trailer for $2,500. The new corps placed it on an abandoned lot and made it their headquarters. On the lot were two shacks from which crack was sold. Gunfire sometimes shattered the trailer's windows.
The crack dealers and their lines of clients have left. A local businessman is paying to renovate the trailer. It will have an enormous sign on top: "The Pride of Bed-Stuy." Three shiny ambulances are parked beside it.
The group established a corps for youths between 12 and 17. They learn basic medical skills and are given a chance to help heal the ravages of drugs and violence that are decimating a generation.
"The average kid wants to be a hero," Mr. Robinson declared. "We teach them how to be a hero and get a job at the same time."
Money for the corps has always been hand-to-mouth. A basketball team, the Shockers, plays benefit games. There have been bake sales and dances. A New Jersey businessman donated $15,000. A private ambulance company came up with a $1,500 insurance payment in February, when the end appeared near.
Foundations have pitched in, particularly the Robin Hood Foundation, headed by Rolling Stone's publisher, Jann S. Wenner. Next Tuesday, he will present Mr. Robinson and Mr. Perez with a check for $25,000.
Mr. Robinson, in turn, plans to donate an ambulance to a new corps forming in Brownsville, East New York and Flatbush.
"We're going to help them like somebody helped us," he said. "That's what it's all about, right?"

HEADLINE: In California, Era of Plenty Fades to Fear

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Standing in the unemployment line today, a cross section of Americans, from a beautician to a film editor to a sales manager to a corporate vice president, voiced a shared sense of insecurity about the future as jobs disappear and companies close.
They said their hunt for work had taken on new urgency as they watched the economy worsen and opportunites dry up. Gathered at an unemployment office in West Los Angeles, they listened with a very personal concern to the news that the unemployment rate in California had climbed today to its highest point in four years. 
 "The hardest thing is to see how panicked people are," said Bill Williams, a part owner of a small marketing company in Huntington Beach that recently went out of business. "Right now, I don't have a dime. I'm worried about buying things like sugar. I'm that close to losing my home. Now is when the nerve systems are really going."
 
A New Line of Work
 Mr. Williams, a 43-year-old man in a worn leather jacket, set down his briefcase and held out his hands, roughened by his new line of work.
"After being an executive," he said, "I'm cleaning toilets now. See my hands? I'm glad to have a $5 job."
Grace Clayton, a 56-year-old hairstylist and home-health aide from Santa Monica, said she had lost clients during a nine-month illness and was finding now that "the competition has gotten so much greater and I just wasn't able to bounce back."
"People are cutting back," she said. "They aren't spending money anymore. They are doing their own hair."
In California, a state that had come to believe in its own economic myth of boundless growth, unemployment jumped last month to 6.7 percent, from 6 percent in October and 5.1 percent in November 1989. California was among the states with the biggest jumps in unemployment.
The aerospace and military contracting industries have already laid off thousands of workers in Southern California, reflecting cuts in Pentagon spending. The real estate market has cooled off dramatically, eliminating construction jobs.
Tax revenue for the first four months of this fiscal year, which began July 1, fell $400 million below previous estimates, contributing to predictions of a $4.3 billion imbalance in the state's budget next year unless strong measures are taken.
"In the longer term, California will continue to outpace the nation" in economic growth, Robert K. Arnold, chairman of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy, a research organization in Palo Alto, said in a telephone interview. "But as far as short-term cyclical economic fluctuations, California flows with the national economy. As goes the nation, so goes California when it comes to recession."
 
'It's a Depression'
 That analysis was echoed today by a corporate vice president in bow tie and tasseled loafers who sat at the unemployment office filling out an application for the first time.
"Recession -- I think it's a depression," snapped the executive, who spoke on condition that his name not be used because he was actively searching for a new corporate job. "The R word: What a joke that is."
He said California's economy had been in a slump for months and that the entire region had been affected by layoffs in the aerospace industry.
"I'm working with a head hunter now and he tells me that the hunting process is taking two to three times longer than it used to," he said.
"I think people are scared here, actually," he went on. "I'm very highly thought of in my field. Normally I wouldn't even bother applying for unemployment insurance. But I need every penny I can get now."
The unemployment line is not new for John Ganem, a 30-year-old assistant film editor in Hollywood.
"Lately I've been working on some really big movies," he said. "I just got done working on 'Godfather.' "In my line of work, it's usual to come down here between jobs."
But he said he was beginning to feel a new uneasiness. He said some friends were finding that the gaps between jobs were growing.
"There is a pretty prevailing air of uncertainty, and I'm not so content to live on my savings now," he said. "I'm not so sure about the future, and that's why I'm much more actively pursuing my next film."
That feeling of uncertainty was also affecting Mary Cibic, 32, who recently lost her job as an account sales manager for an international video company. It was only a few years ago that the concern expanded from Chicago to Los Angeles to take advantage of the growing economy. Now, because of competition from a Taiwanese firm, she said, her company was cutting back again. "Everyone's going now," she said, "the sales manager, the vice president, the president." 
When she looks for work, she said, "it's the old story: either you're overqualified or you're underqualified."
"There's so much competition out there," she said.
What might seem a truism was a deeply felt statement for her, as for the other people waiting on the unemployment line: "I'd rather be working. I love to work. Being unemployed is not advantageous to me."
She said her unemployment benefit of $200 a week was not enough to cover her monthly rent and car payments. The average weekly benefit in California is $120, lasting an average of 14 weeks.
 
Similar Mood in San Francisco
 A similar unsettled mood was evident today in an unemployment line in the Mission District of San Francisco, where Esther Rossen said she was going to have to depend on her savings to support herself and her child. Mrs. Rossen, who recently lost her job when the art gallery where she was working closed, said, "It's going to make it very tough."
Manuel Lago, a 48-year-old immigrant from Cuba, has faced the problem from the opposite perspective. As the manager of a small restaurant that closed three weeks ago, it was part of his job to interview applicants.
"As a manager I saw so many resumes, it was almost pitiful," he said. "I saw so many people who were qualified, who could have done a good job, but I had no openings."
He said the unemployment line set the tone of the holiday spirit of 1990. "Christmas is a headache," he said. "You have to put up the decorations whether you're in the mood or not."

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
Relief, Tears and Hope At the Hostages' Hotel

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 7

 BODY:
First the armed guards disappeared from the lobby. Then the plainclothes secret policemen abandoned their checkpoint in front of the elevators.
Baghdad's hostage hotel, the transit camp for the human shields President Saddam Hussein sought to place between his military-industrial installations and the threat from America's strategic bomber force, was suddenly transformed this week into an emancipation hall after Mr. Hussein announced on Thursday that he had decided to set all foreign hostages free. 
 For some of those gathered at the Melia Al-Mansour Hotel, joy over their anticipated freedom was tempered with doubts about the Iraqi Government's promises.
"No Iraqi official has said anything to me," said Charles P. Keegan, 57 years old, an American who was the chief investment strategist for the Kuwait Investment Company when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. "I'm very vague on just exactly how this is going to unfold," he added.
For months, Iraqi security forces had used the hotel, a well-known downtown landmark, as the way station where some hostages got a few days' access to diplomats from their home country before heading to detention at Iraqi military and economic installations.
 
Slightly Surreal Scene
 The hostages were confined to the hulking, brown concrete structure that overlooks the Tigris River. Foreign reporters were barred from entering.
But this week, with the arrival of dozens of hostages' relatives invited by the Iraqi Government for holiday visits, and then Mr. Hussein's surprise announcement on Thursday, the hotel became a scene of poignant relief, tearful reunions and the expectation that a long and frightening captivity was coming to an end.
In this slightly surreal scene, where journalists freely circulated today with hostages and relatives in the lounges and restaurants and corridors of the hotel, there was still an eerie lack of clarity about the status of those who had been held, their schedule for leaving and the intentions of the faceless security officials who were controlling their lives.
This morning, Joseph C. Wilson 4th, deputy chief of mission at the United States Embassy in Baghdad, met with Mr. Keegan and a large group of hostages to tell them that the embassy was seeking to bring a charter flight into Baghdad to evacuate them as soon as possible.
 
Looking Back at the Ordeal
 In this pause before freedom, and with the anticipation that they will soon return to careers and the normal rhythms of life, many of the hostages spoke about their ordeal.
Mr. Keegan, who is from Des Moines and was reunited with one of his daughters and a son-in-law on Thursday, was arrested on Sept. 19 at the apartment complex where he lived in Kuwait and was held for more than two months near a munitions plant 60 miles southwest of Baghdad.
"At first, I thought about hiding in the air-conditioning ducts like some people," he said. "Ironically, it was a relief to be picked up because while no Iraqi ever threatened me, I would get warning calls from friends in the middle of the night -- that was the most frightening thing, the anticipation of what it might be to be caught."
"I had my bag packed by the door, ready to go" when the Iraqi military police came on Sept. 19, he said.
 
'We Waited Too Long'
 Mr. Keegan also said that he and several other Americans had laid careful plans to escape Kuwait by driving a four-wheel-drive vehicle through the desert to Saudi Arabia with the help of a Bedouin guide. But that the plan faltered as the occupation forces clamped down on escape routes.
"I think the biggest thing is that we waited too long," said Mr. Keegan, who said that upon reflection, the psychology of the unfolding crisis led to procrastination and misjudgments.
"Your mentality is not prepared to cope," he said, "you have a myopic view of your circumstances, and your decision making is clouded by personal wishes." He said he remembered thinking that he would not escape in one car because it was a company vehicle. "That seems ridiculous now in hindsight," he said.
Mr. Keegan related the tale of a Kuwaiti friend who said he was tortured by Iraqi officials who found a pistol in his possession. The man showed Mr. Keegan burn marks on the soles of his feet, which he said were received from Iraqi interrogators who also pushed his head into a toilet and placed a gun to his head and pulled the trigger while the chamber was empty to frighten the man into disclosing whether he was a member of the Kuwaiti resistance.
 
Betrayed by Manager
 Mr. Keegan's whereabouts in Kuwait were betrayed by a Palestinian manager of the apartment complex, but he said he harbored no resentment because he was sure the manager had been threatened with death.
"When the Iraqis came through, they scared the living daylights out of them," he said, "I would not have expected them to lie for me -- I would have done the same thing."
Passing by Mr. Keegan's lunch table today was Hamid el-Hiloudi, 46, an air-conditioning contractor from Chatanooga, Tenn., who took refuge in the American Embassy in Kuwait on Aug. 18 and remained there until Nov. 21.
Mr. Hiloudi, who was born in Morocco, became the "Mr. Green Jeans" of the embassy compound when he decided in October to plant a large vegetable garden to help sustain the 6 or 7 diplomats and 19 others who remain there. The title was bestowed on him by Barbara Bodine, the embassy's deputy chief of mission.
 
Food for About 60 Days
 He estimated that when he left the embassy had enough food to sustain its refugee population for about 60 days, with about 3,000 cans of tuna fish and mackerel remaining, along with supplies of rice and sugar.
In November, Ambassador Nathaniel Howell was forced to cut back his communications to Washington to three scheduled sessions a week, Mr. Hiloudi said, to conserve fuel that powers the embassy's satellite communications link.
Mr. Hiloudi spoke with pride about his association with the effort to keep the American flag flying over the compound and said he now regretted leaving his comrades in November, when Iraqi officials promised him a safe exit because of his Arab origins, then reneged.
"With all the beans and peas I planted, they'll make it," he said, before American officials announced in Washington that Ambassdor Howell, his staff and the refugees there would abandon the mission.
 
'Created Our Own World'
 Joining Mr. Keegan at the lunch table today were Stuart Williams, 58; his wife, Charlene Coutre, and Mr. Williams's daughter, Jennifer, 21, a student at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
Mr. Williams and his wife, who have a home in New York, took an assignment last summer to manage Gulf Bank's operations in Kuwait. They were taken captive when the Iraqis invaded and held along with dozens of British nationals at the Mina Al-Ahmadi oil refinery just south of Kuwait City.
"We created our own world where we shut out what was around us," Mr. Williams said. When Iraq announced in September that it would allow women and children to leave, Mrs. Coutre refused to abandon her husband. She was the only woman among the 64 hostages brought by bus from the Kuwait refinery two weeks ago.
Mr. Williams's daughter said she traveled to Baghdad this week over the objection of Bush Administration officials, thinking she had a slim chance to help free her father by making a special appeal to Mr. Hussein during the holiday season. She was surprised by the sudden turn of events that freed him.
"I hated waiting, being passive," she said. "My life had come to a stop."
Mr. Williams said: "Men are brought up learning how to be in control, how to manage things, but in this situation I was totally helpless and I had to look to the women in my family to bail me out. When they did, it felt marvelous."

HEADLINE: TRADE TALKS END WITHOUT MENDING RIFT OVER FARMING

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 7

 BODY:
A four-year round of talks to establish new rules for world trade broke off in disarray today as the United States and the European Community remained deadlocked over the issue of reducing subsidies to farmers.
Trade ministers had set today as a deadline to reach an agreement to liberalize rules governing $4 trillion in annual world trade. The goal was an accord that could increase economic growth and living standards worldwide by removing government rules that restrict trade not only in agriculture but also in a wide range of manufactured goods, financial services and technological expertise. 
 But instead, after marathon negotiations throughout the week, the trade officials gave up, disbanded and suspended the talks after failing to overcome their impasse on farm trade.
 
Some Talk of Resuming
 Trade officials tried to put the best face on the failure. The chairman of the 107-nation talks, Hector Gros Espiell, the Foreign Minister of Uruguay, expressed confidence that the ministers, after additional reflection and consultation with the heads of their governments, would resume the talks in Geneva in a month or two.
John Crosbie, the Trade Minister of Canada, said, "It's a failure that leaves a ray of hope."
But many officials said that unless the wide gulf between the American and European positions on farm trade could be bridged, the breakup in Brussels might signal that the talks had collapsed permanently, ending the effort to set international trading rules for the 21st century.
American officials say the lack of success in the talks could have significant effects on American consumers, farmers, workers and businesses. For example, with many countries subsidizing exports of their grain, a failure to reduce agricultural protection could make it harder for American farmers to export wheat. For American pharmaceutical companies, the deadlock means they will have to wait longer to get third world nations to agree to respect their patents.
For American consumers, a trade agreement could mean lower prices for many goods, from peanuts to pants, since an agreement could result in lower tariffs and import barriers. At the same time, an agreement might bode ill for the jobs of American textile workers because an accord would probably reduce quotas on clothing imports from the developing world.
Conversely, many governments in the third world hope for an agreement because it would probably mean new markets and more jobs for their textile industries.
'We Have Failed'
"We have tried to improve the economic situation in the world, but we have failed," Helmut Haussmann, the Economics Minister of Germany, said today.
The round of talks, known as the Uruguay Round because it began in that country in 1986, aims to set liberal new rules in 15 broad areas of trade, including farming, patents, financial services, telecommunications and textiles.
This week's talks were dominated by a bitter clash between the European Community on one side, and the United States, Canada, Argentina and more than a dozen other nations on the other. The community was reluctant to move nearly as far as the other side wanted in slashing farm subsidies. The Europeans, who pay the most generous farm subsidies, said the opposing side was asking for cuts that were too deep to be politically acceptable in Europe. The French, in particular, resisted big reductions in payments to farmers.
Business representatives attending the talks were alarmed by the suspension of the negotiations.
 
A Businessman Reacts
 "The astounding failure of political will has not only risked throwing away the progress made during four years of hard work, it has placed a major question mark over the future of the existing multilateral trading system," said Peter Wallenberg, a Swedish businessman who heads the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce.
Trade officials fear that without an agreement trade wars could erupt as nations erect barriers to protect domestic businesses and farmers from imported goods. Such beggar-thy-neighbor policies are economically counterproductive, eventually hurting industries, farmers and consumers throughout the world, trade officials say.
Many officials predicted that without an overall agreement there would be more and more bilateral and regional pacts in which the most powerful countries or blocs, like the United States or the European Community, would have the upper hand.
After two nights of attending negotiations and meetings until 4 A.M., Carla A. Hills, the chief American trade negotiator, was dismayed today. Nonetheless, she said it was better to have the talks suspended than to accept an agreement that would make only minor changes in the international trading system.
 
Disappointment and Optimism
 "I am very disappointed, but I think it's much more important that we stand on our position of opening markets," she said. Nonetheless, she was optimistic that all sides would make the necessary compromises to reach an agreement because they recognize the importance of liberalizing and modernizing world trade rules.
Agriculture has become the key to success of the Uruguay Round because the United States and a group of 14 food-exporting countries, known as the Cairns Group, have said they would not accept an overall pact unless it included large cuts in farm protection.
Washington and the Cairns Group -- which includes Canada, Argentina, Brazil and Australia -- say paying subsidies to farmers results in overproduction that drives down prices, while paying special subsidies to promote food exports robs the most efficient producers of markets.
 
Payments to Farmers
 Agricultural subsidies come in many shapes and sizes, and one of the most common is government payments to farmers when the price of their crop falls below a certain target price.
The United States and the Cairns Group, named for the Australian town where the group was formed in 1986, proposed a 75 percent cut in such internal supports over 10 years and a 90 percent cut in export subsidies. In contrast, the European Community proposed reducing internal supports by 30 percent over 10 years retroactive to 1986, when the community made some subsidy cuts. At the same time, the community refused to make specific commitments on reducing export subsidies and barriers to farm imports.
Negotiators said that on Thursday morning it seemed that a longstanding logjam in the talks had finally become unblocked, when the European Community indicated it would offer to reduce export subsidies and import barriers. The talks became deadlocked again late Thursday night, however, when American and Cairns Group officials concluded that the community's offer was too imprecise and inconsequential.
"There was no official offer from them," Mrs. Hills said. "They don't have anything on the table."
To push the talks along, the Agriculture Minister of Sweden, Mats Hellstrom, who led the agricultural negotiations, had offered a compromise proposal for discussion, suggesting 30 percent cuts in internal supports, import barriers and export subsidies from 1991 to 1996. Although Britain and the Netherlands found the proposal interesting and worth discussion, the community negotiators, bowing to France's insistence, refused to negotiate on the basis of the Hellstrom proposal.
 
The Europeans' Defense
 Community officials denied that they were inflexible, saying they had agreed, for example, not to raise soybean tariffs as part of a much-criticized proposal under which they would increase import barriers in some areas as they lowered them in others.
Speaking about Washington and some of its allies, Raymond MacSharry, the community's Agriculture Commissioner, said, "Unless and until they reduce the expectations they have had for quite some time now, there will not be an agreement on agriculture."
In the view of some American officials, the key to breaking the deadlock is to get agreement to concessions from President Francois Mitterrand of France, the community's leading food-exporting nation. That is not expected to be easy, however, because French farmers, who staged several large demonstrations last summer, are already suffering severely from drought and falling prices for beef and lamb. The French Government, which barely survived a no-confidence motion last month, is not eager to offend the two million French farmers.
 
Consultations Planned
 Under the terms of the meeting's suspension, Arthur Dunkel, the Director General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based organization sponsoring the talks, is to consult with leaders from different nations over the next few weeks. If he concludes that they will be flexible enough to make it possible to reach a final agreement, then he can summon back the negotiators.
One GATT official suggested that Mr. Dunkel might reconvene the negotiations in late February. American negotiators must submit a fiinished agreement to Congress by March 1 if Congress is to give it "fast track" consideration. This means Congress would have to vote the whole agreement up or down, rather than examine it line by line, which might allow the lawmakers to pick apart a carefully balanced agreement.

HEADLINE: Buenos Aires Journal;
An Army Revolt One Day, an Invasion the Next

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 7

 BODY:
On the morning this week that President Bush awoke in Buenos Aires, a local newspaper carried a front-page cartoon showing a crowd of tall men in dark glasses surrounding an almost invisible Mr. Bush, protecting him from the slight figure of President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina.
The dialogue went this way: "Mr. President, there's a guy here who says he's the President of the natives. Has a Latin aspect, is between five and six feet tall and weighs about 130 pounds." 
 "Does he have sideburns?"
"Yes, sir."
"What's his name?"
"He says it's Menem."
"Let him through."
For a people who had experienced the rise and collapse of an army rebellion on their way to and from work on Monday, Mr. Bush's visit on Wednesday sometimes gave them the sensation that they had subsequently fallen victim to foreign occupation.
 
Menem's New Book Released
 But if Argentine journalists and spectators were a bit put off at being ordered around in English by hundreds of big, blunt-spoken men, Mr. Menem and his aides appeared to think the payoff in backing for their embattled policies and Government had been more than worth it.
Mr. Menem, in fact, in the glow of the aftermath, today introduced his new book, "The United States, Argentina and Carlos Menem." It details how he has brought about a 180-degree shift in Argentine relations with the United States in his 17 months in the presidency.
In countries of the region where a warm embrace and endorsement from President Bush were less crucial than they were for Mr. Menem at this particular time, the sheer might and seeming arrogance of the traveling American Presidency made the visit a mixed blessing. Mr. Bush's five-nation South American tour continued today in Venezuela.
Hundreds of advance people showed up in each country several weeks ahead of Mr. Bush. Giant C-5 Galaxy aircraft landed and unloaded fleets of sophisticated helicopters and unknown quantities of marines. And hundreds of telephone lines were installed in each country, including one for each of the more than 200 White House correspondents.
 
Great Mobile Phone Service
 This meant, for example, that you could call a direct number at the Hotel Sheraton in Buenos Aires and hear an American voice respond "Buenos Aires White House," explain that he was manning the A.T.&T. telephone system brought intact from the United States and ask if you were calling "from Stateside."
Cultural and linguistic sensitivities were reflected in many of the reactions that people expressed to all of this.
"I wouldn't say there was a reaction against Bush, but the extent of the security certainly drew people's attention," said Danilo Arbilla, a newspaper editor in Uruguay, where Mr. Bush stopped the day before he came to Buenos Aires.
Mr. Arbilla said irritated members of the Uruguayan Parliament had refused instructions from the White House security people to wear the lapel insignia issued to the legislators for the Mr. Bush's speech. And he said the security people had ordered President Luis Alberto Lacalle's press secretary, who has an office next to his, to leave the area before Mr. Bush arrived. She resisted and was waiting at the door when the meeting began.
 
English Is Irritating
 Further, said Mr. Arbilla, the efforts of the multi-lingual Mr. Lacalle to accommodate the visiting White House press corps by answering their questions in English drew criticism from some listeners in Uruguay, who thought he should have responded in Spanish and left the English to the interpreter.
"It wasn't so much the security that bothered people here as the White House press corps," said Maria Elena Ipinza, who works with the foreign press in Chile, where Mr. Bush stopped after leaving Buenos Aires on Thursday morning.
She said that while President Patricio Aylwin of Chile, who stands six feet tall, is up in Mr. Bush's stratosphere enough so as not to be lost standing beside him at a news conference, the White House press corps dismayed Chileans by asking all their questions of Mr. Bush and by focusing them on the expected release of hostages in Iraq and Kuwait.
To top that, she added, none of the White House press corps attended a news conference offered by Alejandro Foxley, Chile's English-speaking Finance Minister and the Government's point man in the dynamic, free-market economy that Mr. Bush himself said had made Chile "the center of economic activity in Latin America," even if it is "at the end of the world."
 
Visited Despite Rebellion
 Aides to Mr. Menem, in their morning-after assessment of the visit to Argentina, were convinced that nothing but good had come with it because of the strong backing and praise Mr. Bush gave to the Argentine leader for his efforts to rebuild the economy along free-market lines and his success at controlling the rebellion by some 300 army dissidents.
They said that while Mr. Bush gave a "slap" to the Brazilians on his first stop for their failure to reach agreement with foreign creditors, there had been no similar "scolding" here -- maybe because of the trauma Mr. Menem had undergone with the rebellion.
They were especially grateful for the fact that Mr. Bush had declared his willingness to come even while the bullets were still flying here.
Neverthless, Pagina 12, the irreverent but respected newspaper that carried the cartoon about the Bush security, gave its own opinion in a banner headline on his departure: "Alone at Last."

HEADLINE: JOBLESSNESS RISES TO A 3-YEAR HIGH; FED EASES CREDIT

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
In a report of almost unrelieved gloom, the Government said today that the economy lost more than a quarter of a million jobs in November. The unemployment rate climbed two-tenths of a point to 5.9 percent, the highest since October 1987.
The number of goods-producing jobs skidded by 255,000, far more than expected, with downturns in every durable-goods industry. Factory jobs accounted for 200,000 of the loss. Almost 800,000 factory jobs have disappeared since the beginning of 1989. 
 Service employment, which has been sputtering after a long expansion, fell by 12,000 last month.
 
Action on Interest Rates
 Today's report, which seemed to remove any remaining doubt among most economists that the economy had slipped into recession, clearly worried the Federal Reserve Board. Shortly after the report was released, the Federal Reserve moved for the second time this week to make money more available. To stimulate the economy, it injected money into the banking system, pushing down by about a quarter point the rate banks charge each other for temporary loans. [Page 33.]
A few regional banks cut their prime lending rates to 9 3/4 percent from 10 percent, the first drop in nearly a year. But credit market analysts said large banks would be reluctant to follow the lead because it would reduce their depressed profit margins. The analysts suggested that the Federal Reserve would have to loosen credit further before most borrowers would see lower interest rates on home mortgages and home equity and other consumer and business loans. [Page 37.]
 
'Unambiguous' Figures
 The unemployment figures released today are "unambiguous," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. "Now the question is how are you going to get out" of the downturn.
Today's figures painted "a dismal picture" of the job market, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, Janet L. Norwood, said during her monthly appearance before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. She said they warranted "an extremely pessimistic view" of business activity in general.
The committee chairman, Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, asked Dr. Norwood whether the economy was now in a stage of "cumulative unwinding," using the phrase Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has adopted as his shorthand definition of recession. She replied, "We are certainly beginning to see signs of that."
As a rule of thumb, the economy is considered to be in recession after two consecutive quarters of declining national output of goods and services, adjusted for inflation. But the economists who make the official determination scrutinize a downturn for severity and breadth as well as duration. A recession could, in fact, be confined to a single quarter.
The President's chief economic adviser, Michael J. Boskin, was clearly disappointed with the figures reported today. "While the modest rise in the unemployment rate was expected because of the recent sluggishness in the economy," he said, "the reduction in employment, especially including the October revision, was larger than expected."
He acknowledged that the economy was now almost certain to contract during the fourth quarter but said "it's too early to tell" whether it would continue to decline into the new year.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat who is the House majority leader, issued a statement asserting that since the middle of the year the "army of the unemployed has swollen by nearly a million unwilling enlistees." He urged President Bush to shift his attention to dealing with "the recession which is now surely upon us."
Recessions can have major political consequences, affecting voters nationwide. The Federal budget deficit has already worsened because of the economy as well as the rising cost of bailing out savings and loan institutions, and a continuing economic downturn would cut tax receipts and increase Government expenses in relief efforts like unemployment compensation.
 
Grim Nature of Report
 There was virtually nothing to soften the grim nature of the first comprehensive report on the November economy apart from a new increase in jobs in health services and a small gain in oil drilling jobs, In addition, the call-up of military reserves may have exaggerated the severity of job losses.
One particularly sobering note was the fact that practically all the people added to the ranks of the unemployed were dismissed or laid off rather than people who quit their last jobs or who were entering or re-entering the labor force.
The number of jobs, as determined by the Labor Department's survey of business payrolls, tumbled 267,000, a fall that was more than triple many private estimates. Furthermore, the decline for October was revised to show a loss of 178,000 jobs instead of the 68,000 initially reported.
This was the worst two-month decline since late 1982, when the latest declared recession was ending.
The automobile industry, which had announced production cutbacks in the face of slumping sales, shed 55,000 jobs, and many other jobs were lost in industries that supply auto plants, with fabricated metal products and rubber and plastics products each down about 15,000, and apparel and other textile products down 10,000.
But there were also large declines last month in the number of jobs producing industrial machinery, equipment, lumber and furniture.
Moreover, people who kept their factory jobs worked fewer hours: The average workweek fell by 12 minutes, to 40 1/2 hours. Factory hours had fallen by 18 minutes in October.
The construction industry lost 60,000 more jobs last month, bringing the total to 250,000 over the past six months.
 
In Retail, Below Expectations
 In the service sector, the figures were also bad. For the retail trade, seasonal hiring for Christmas meant a gain of more than 200,000 jobs, but after allowing for statistical expectations, there was a decline of 70,000. Employment in wholesale trade fell by 10,000, and job losses continued in the finance and real estate industries. Business services lost 20,000 jobs.
These losses overwhelmed the growth in jobs in health care. Health care employment rose by about 60,000, while another small gain in oil drilling jobs brought the two-month total to almost 10,000.
The unemployment rate in the oil-producing state of Texas, however, surged to 7 percent from 5.7 percent, the biggest change by far among the 11 biggest industrial states. The jobless rates in California and Massachusetts each rose seven-tenths of a point, to 6.7 percent and 7 percent, respectively.
In New York, however, the rate dropped two-tenths of a point, to 5.4 percent, while the jobless rate in New York City fell to 7.4 percent from 7.7 percent, the department reported. New Jersey's jobless rate was unchanged at 5.5 percent.
Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner for the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that while New York and New Jersey had avoided an upswing in the unemployment rate, "Basically, there's very little cheer in the November numbers." He attributed the figures partly to a lack of growth in the labor force. "People are just not entering the labor market," he said.
Because of smaller samples, changes for individual states of less than half a point are considered statistically insignificant. But the state figures do give a general indication of how state economies are faring.
According to the Government's separate survey of households, the number of civilians employed dropped by 450,000 last month, while the number of civilians working or actively looking for work fell 168,000. As a result, the ranks of the unemployed jumped by 282,000, to a total of 7,355,000, for an unemployment rate of 5.9 percent.
The overall jobless rate, which includes about 1,615,000 military personnel stationed in the United States, rose two-tenths of a point in November, to 5.8 percent.
Most of the increased joblessness occurred among adult men, whose rate of unemployment rose by three-tenths of a point, to 5.4 percent, up from 4.7 percent in June. This population group tends to be hit hard in a recession since men dominate factory jobs, which are most susceptible to contraction.
The unemployment rate for all factory workers climbed nearly a full point last month, to 6.6 percent, while the rate for those in durable-goods manufacturing soared to 7.1 percent from 5.8 percent. For construction, the jobless rate rose to 13.6 percent from 13.2 percent.
 
Rise in Job Losers
 The number of job losers, including those who expect to be recalled from layoff, rose nearly 300,000 last month, bringing the total to nearly 700,000 since June. Last month 3.1 percent of the labor force had either been dismissed or laid off, up from 2.8 percent in October and 2.5 percent in July. Re-entrants who could not find jobs represented 1.5 percent of the work force, those who quit their latest jobs accounted for eight-tenths of a point and new entrants accounted for five-tenths of a point.
The ranks of both the newly unemployed -- those jobless for less than five weeks -- and those out of work for 27 weeks or more, a group whose basic unemployment compensation had run out, both swelled last month.
And the number of people who wanted to work full time but were employed only part time because of slack work rose by 170,000, the department reported.
The proportion of the working-age population with jobs fell to 62.1 last month from 62.4 in October, and that was down from about the 63 percent level during 1989 and the first half of 1990. The ratio for adult women, at 54.5 percent, is now a full point below its June peak.

HEADLINE: Regional Defense Plan Urged for Europe

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Backing plans to turn the European Community into a powerful political bloc, France and Germany proposed today that the 12-nation group develop a regional foreign and security policy with a view toward adopting a common defense policy.
Debate about the need for the community to take an independent security role has intensified over the last four months since the Persian Gulf crisis exposed Western Europe's continued reliance on the United States to protect its vital economic interests. 
 The two countries nonetheless stressed that a common defense policy would not affect the region's commitments to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and they argued that a "European pillar" would serve to strengthen the 16-nation NATO alliance.
Coming just one week before an important summit of community leaders in Rome, however, the move today by France and Germany seemed principally inspired by a desire to set the agenda for coming negotiations on what is described as the future "political union" of Western Europe.
 
New European Powers Proposed
 Urging the community to act increasingly as a bloc in international affairs, President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl also proposed giving new powers to the European Parliament, creating a common European citizenship and expanding areas subject to community control.
They said the community's authority should eventually embrace the environment, health, social policy, energy and consumer protection, while the entire question of border controls, including immigration, drug trafficking and terrorism, should be handled by a new 12-nation body.
Political experts said that by going public with their ideas now, Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Kohl appeared anxious to forestall any efforts by Britain's new Prime Minister, John Major, to limit the scope of the debate on political union, above all as it relates to foreign, defense and security questions.
Final decisions on further European integration will be made by two inter-governmental conferences on economic and monetary union and on political union that are to be inaugurated in Rome after next week's summit, but community leaders will instruct negotiators on what they should discuss.
 
Major Eager to Break Pattern
 At their last summit in late October, issuing guidelines on economic and monetary union, European Community leaders overrode the objections of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and called for the creation of a regional central bank and adoption of a single European currency after 1994.
British officials have said that, when taking part in his first European summit next week, Mr. Major is anxious to break the pattern of British isolation, but they said he was determined not to be rushed into surrendering any additional British sovereignty before the intergovernmental conferences.
The political experts said that the initiative today by Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Kohl was of special significance to France because it signaled that longstanding cooperation between Paris and Bonn on European affairs had survived the test of German unification.

Far From Mudville

BYLINE: By Russell Baker

 BODY:
Recession? What recession?
 The Boston Red Sox have agreed to pay Matt Young, a pitcher, $6.35 million for the next three baseball seasons. 
 Down the pay scale a notch, Rob Deer, who used to play the outfield for the Milwaukee Brewers, has agreed to accept $6.05 million for working three seasons with the Detroit Tigers.
 In letting Mr. Deer go to Detroit for his multimillion-dollar payday, the Milwaukee Brewers were not tightening their belts, however, or whatever baseball people tighten now that their pants are already so tight that belts are unnecessary.
 To the contrary, as the players' agents say when a team owner says $2 million is too much for a catcher who can't hit .225, to the contrary -- are you ready for this?
The Milwaukee Brewers have agreed to pay $6 million to Franklin Stubbs, a hitter formerly employed by the Houston Astros, to do his hitting in Milwaukee for the next three years.
 The Brewers have also contracted with a pitcher named Edwin Nunez, to pitch two seasons for them at a salary of $1.9 million.
 Even this didn't deplete the Brewers' bank vat, so they were also able to persuade Ted Higuera, a left-handed pitcher, to continue working in Milwaukee for four more years.
 Remember days and days of everybody shouting "Four more years! Four more years!" when the Republican Convention re-nominated Richard Nixon in 1972? Nixon lasted only two more years until Watergate got him. Watergate for baseball pitchers is torn rotator cuff, or bone chips in the subcutaneous fat, or something equally incomprehensible to everybody but sportswriters, yet terribly common.
 Nevertheless, the Brewers have put up a $13 million contract that says left-handed-pitcher Higuera can give them four more years. As Gordon Gekko might have said, "Eat your heart out, Carl Hubbell."
 You don't know who Gordon Gekko is? Don't worry. It speaks well of you. It proves you had the good taste to pass up the 1980's.
 Everybody, though, surely knows who Carl Hubbell was. Just about the best left-handed pitcher ever to have a sportswriter refer to his business arm as "the old soupbone," that's who Carl Hubbell was. And what was his salary? About $35 a week probably.
 The Kansas City Royals have agreed to pay Mike Boddicker, a pitcher, $9.25 million to leave Boston and play three years in Kansas City.
 They have also agreed to pay Kirk Gibson, who used to play the outfield in Detroit, and then in Los Angeles, $3.4 million to come work two seasons in Kansas City.
 What about New York, the home office of big bucks? The Yankees have snared a pitcher, name of Steve Farr, at $6.3 million for three years' work in pinstripes. They have also persuaded one of their not-so-terrible pitchers, Tim Leary, to continue to be a Yankee three more years for a consideration of $5.95 million.
 Not to be outdone in the competition to prove that New York is a jock's bonanza, the Mets have persuaded Vince Coleman (base stealer, infielder) to leave St. Louis and spend the next four years in Queens. The persuader: $11.95 million.
 This sum may make you goggle if your sport is chess hustling in Times Square, but it's not in the same league with the five-year, $20.25 million contract the Los Angeles Dodgers gave Darryl Strawberry after he lost his zest for playing in Queens. There's something possible here about Queens gambit declined being the road to checkmate, but you'd have to be named Karpov or Kasparov to get it, so let's move on to Atlanta.
 That's where Terry Pendleton, formerly of the St. Louis Cardinals, has agreed to move on to, and you probably would, too, if the Atlanta Braves offered to treat you the way they promise to treat Pendleton: namely, by paying him $10.2 million over four years for playing third base.
 Atlanta is also bringing in Sid Bream, a pitcher, to work three years for $5 million.
 Fort Knox, however, is not in Atlanta but in San Francisco, and the Giants -- those same cheapskates who once paid Carl Hubbell no more than $35 a week probably -- have the keys to the treasure and a generous heart for wandering ballplayers.
 The wanderers who will be walking in the great Hubbell's footprints -- and with sufficient taste, one hopes, to feel just a little inadequate -- include:
 Bud Black, pitcher, at $10 million for four years; Willie McGee, outfielder, at $13 million for four years, and Dave Righetti, pitcher, at $10 million for four years.
 Boys, you've come a long way from Mudville.

HEADLINE: Hortense W. Gabel, 77, Ex-Judge And New York City Official, Dies

BYLINE: By ALFONSO A. NARVAEZ

 BODY:
Hortense W. Gabel, a former New York State Supreme Court justice who was a longtime advocate for housing and civil rights and whose career was shattered when she was accused in the Bess Myerson case, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 years old.
She died of heart failure, her daughter, Sukhreet, said. 
 Mrs. Gabel served on the Civil Court and State Supreme Court for 17 years. In December 1988 she was acquitted of charges that she had abused her powers by improperly reducing the alimony payments of Ms. Myerson's companion, Carl A. Capasso, in exchange for a job for her daughter in the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, which Ms. Myerson headed.
Mrs. Gabel had a long and distinguished career in government before assuming the Civil Court bench in 1970. That career began after Mrs. Gabel, already active as a reform Democrat, attended a dinner party in 1948 given by Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, the founder of the American Jewish Congress; discussion at the party centered on the formation of a group that would champion the cause of blacks discriminated against in housing.
 
Enforced Rent Laws
 By the mid-1950's, as a director of the Committee on Discrimination in Housing, she was involved in trying to expose abuses in the urban renewal program in New York City and helped draft a report that was highly critical of Robert Moses, the builder who reshaped much of the city.
As head of New York City's Rent and Rehabilitation Administration, she dreamed of a slumless New York, and her enforcement of the rent-control laws uncovered overcharges and conspiracies, saving tenants millions of dollars. She also developed rehabilitation programs for sections of Harlem, the Lower East Side and Brooklyn.
Later, as a consultant to and vice president of the Center for Community Change, Mrs. Gabel helped develop housing programs in cities and states across the country.
In her several decades of public service, she served as an assistant New York City corporation counsel, general counsel and first deputy administrator of the New York State Temporary Housing Rent Commission and assistant to the mayor for housing and New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Commissioner, a position she held from 1962 to 1965. Mrs. Gabel was also a consultant to the Federal Housing and Home Finance Agency and to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
She served as an acting justice of the State Supreme Court in 1973 and as an acting Family Court judge in 1974. She was appointed to fill a vacancy on the State Supreme Court by Gov. Hugh L. Carey in 1975. She was known as a compassionate judge who supported civil rights and women's causes. In 1986, she was named judge of the year by the National Association of Women Judges, an organization she helped found in 1979.
The organization's president, Justice Christine Durham of the Utah Supreme Court, said in a 1987 interview that Justice Gabel was revered as "one of the grand dames of the New York legal community, who has been a mentor and supporter of women in the profession for decades."
Justice Gabel resigned in 1987 under the cloud of criminal and misconduct investigations that led to the Myerson indictments.
A jury in Federal District Court in Manhattan found Mrs. Gabel, Ms. Myerson and Mr. Capasso not guilty of charges of conspiracy, fraud and bribery. The central issue in the case was whether Mrs. Gabel, who was the judge handling preliminary motions in Mr. Capasso's divorce case in 1983, had received a bribe from Ms. Myerson, then New York City's Cultural Affairs Commissioner, in the form of a job for Sukhreet Gabel as a special assistant to Ms. Myerson.
The hiring, the prosecution said, was an inducement to reduce Mr. Capasso's weekly support payments to his wife to $500 from $1,500. Mrs. Gabel had been seeking a job for her daughter.
 
Family Drama
 The case was full of bizarre twists and personal dramas. The two-month trial was dominated by the nine days of testimony against her mother by Sukhreet Gabel, the prosecution's star witness, who also taped two telephone conversations with her mother without her knowledge and provided prosecutors with some of her mother's documents.
Mrs. Gabel and her husband, Dr. Milton Gabel, were portrayed during the trial as the protective parents of a troubled woman, and seemed torn between wanting to support her in her moment in the spotlight and hoping that her testimony would not sway the jury.
After the verdict, an exuberant Mrs. Gabel held hands with her daughter outside the courthouse and shouted, "Hooray, we won!"
"This is the best judicial experience I have ever had," she said.
Hortense Wittstein Gabel, known as Horty to her friends, was born Dec. 16, 1912, in the Bronx. She attended public schools in the city and graduated from Hunter College in 1934. Three years later she graduated from Columbia University Law School and worked in her father's law firm. She left in 1944 to marry Dr. Gabel, then an army dentist, and in the war years was a reporter at Fort Hood, Tex., before returning to New York.
In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Sybil Phillips. They both live in Manhattan. Dr. Gabel died in July.

 BODY:

STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND
By Robert A. Heinlein.
525 pp. New York:
Ace/G.P. Putnam's Sons. $24.95. 
 IN London in October, at a dinner party in the home of the publisher Tom Maschler, head of Jonathan Cape, our host asked a question that was primitive but deep. "What is the best novel ever written?" I nominated "Madame Bovary." A majority went for "Anna Karenina." Anna had glamour, Emma didn't. That was that. We hastened on to gossip about Salman Rushdie and so forth.
Afterward, though, as I sat alone in my room at Brown's Hotel, I marveled that none of us had celebrated a story that took place in the world at large rather than in a stratified and codified little society. And Tom Wolfe a few months earlier had told the rest of us in the fiction trade to either do deep-dish reportage on members of little groups, right down to the name of the manufacturers of the shoes they wore, or take up macrame.
Yes, and now Putnam has published for the first time the full text of "Stranger in a Strange Land," by Robert A. Heinlein (1907-88), an abridged version of which has sold 100,000 copies in hard cover and nearly five million in paper since its debut in 1961. An enormous number of readers have found this book a brilliant mind-bender, and yet I doubt that Heinlein's name was ever uttered at a meeting of PEN or in the halls of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. Despite his having written this book and about 40 others ("The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress," "I Will Fear No Evil," "Methuselah's Children," "The Puppet Masters" and on and on), this remarkable man, whom I never met, was included only in "Who's Who in Science Fiction," and died without having been considered worthy of an entry in the more inclusive annual "Who's Who." The president of the American Poultry Association is sure as heck in the big 'Who's Who" somewhere.
How could this have happened? My goodness, the name of the leading character in "Stranger in a Strange Land" is as familiar to millions of literate persons as Oliver Twist or Holden Caulfield. He is Valentine Michael Smith. But he was raised by Martians on Mars, without ever having seen another human being. And to those who get to say which novels are serious and which are not, professional critics and teachers of literature in the company of authors of novels about the rise or fall of ordinary people in provincial societies, he is absolutely intolerable. He is far more dismaying to them, say, than a character found when an infant in an overnight bag in Victoria Station. And I say that their rejection of not only Valentine Michael Smith, but his creator, too, is an act based on social prejudices, and that intellectual and esthetic standards have nothing to do with it.
The great critic H. L. Mencken confessed as much without shame, saying that he could not appreciate the works of Willa Cather since he simply wasn't interested in people from Nebraska. That isn't criticism. That is snobbery. In the Soviet Union before glasnost the Writers' Union regularly said that some writers weren't really writers, no matter how much and how well they had written, since they were politically incorrect. In this country the same thing is done to writers like Robert A. Heinlein because they are socially incorrect, because their stories are about places members of the literary establishment do not care to visit and about characters, many of them not even human or humanoid, they simply do not care to befriend.
Truth be told, the establishment, on the same grounds, isn't all that fond of "Candide" or "Gulliver's Travels," either, both of which I should have championed at Tom Maschler's house. I should have at least mentioned "Stranger in a Strange Land" as well, a wonderfully humanizing artifact for those who can enjoy thinking about the place of human beings not at a dinner table but in the universe.
We are approaching the 30th birthday of "Stranger in a Strange Land." Valentine Michael Smith is the stranger. Raised by Martians on Mars, he is brought to Earth where he must adapt not only to our social prejudices, but to our strong gravitational field and rich atmosphere. Some 60,000 words that were cut from Heinlein's manuscript for reasons of economy back in 1961 are at last taking their rightful place in the body of world literature. There is a preface by the author's widow, Virginia Heinlein, which speaks not at all of the neglect of her husband's work by the establishment. It tells the history of the uncut manuscript, which, if it weren't for her, might have remained in total darkness forever in a vault in the library of the University of California at Santa Cruz.
Is the story much improved by the restored passages? I leave it to someone else to compare the two versions line by line. The thought-provoking premise is unchanged and could scarcely be enriched. Nor did the consequences of that premise as extrapolated by Heinlein seem to me garbled or anemic or whatever in the abridged edition I read years ago. So I say of the restorations, "Icing on a cake which for people who like that kind of cake was already quite satisfactory."
Am I arguing that "Stranger in a Strange Land" is anywhere near as good as "Madame Bovary"? Good heavens no! No novel has come within a kilometer of the greatness of Flaubert's masterpiece. Not even "Anna Karenina." Not even "The Bonfire of the Vanities."

 
 
THE BIGGEST, FATTEST SACRED COWS

"I believe that I have dreamed up a really new S-F idea, a hard thing to do these days," Robert Heinlein confided to his agent, Lurton Blassingame, in 1952. His idea (which had emerged in a discussion with his wife, Virginia) used the picaresque adventures of a young human, brought to Earth after having been raised from infancy by Martians, to probe human prejudices and foibles. "Absolutely everything about Earth is strange to him . . . its orientations, motives, pleasures, evaluations. On the other hand, he himself has received the education of a wise and subtle and very advanced -- but completely nonhuman -- race." No stranger to controversy, Heinlein saw the novel as an opportunity to launch frontal assaults on "the two biggest, fattest sacred cows" of Western society, "monotheism and monogamy."
The book had a long, uncertain evolution. There were many drafts. The final version, 220,000 words long (down from the 600,000 he had once envisioned), was finished in two feverish months and submitted in 1960 to G. P. Putnam's Sons. Putnam accepted the book but requested that it be trimmed. Heinlein reluctantly complied, deleting 60,000 words and, in the process, some of the more provocative passages lampooning American attitudes toward sex and religion.
Even in its pared-down form, the book was intensely controversial. Some reviews were descriptive rather than judgmental. Others shared the ire expressed by Orville Prescott in the pages of The New York Times. The reviewer described the novel as a "disastrous mishmash of science fiction, laborious humor, dreary social satire and cheap eroticism."
Despite such responses the book sold well. It quickly went into a book club edition, appeared in paperback, and eventually became the first science-fiction title to appear on The New York Times Book Review's best-seller list. In 1989 Virginia Heinlein approached Putnam with the suggestion that the complete work, based on Heinlein's working manuscript, should be published. While the restored version does not present a radically new work, it does offer readers a chance to watch Heinlein working out his ideas at greater length, and challenging society's "sacred cows" with unexpurgated zest.
Heinlein was bemused by those who claimed that the work provided a blueprint for a new society. The novel was not written, he explained to one fan, to promulgate any set of beliefs. "I was not giving answers. I was trying to shake the reader loose from some preconceptions and induce him to think for himself, along new and fresh lines. In consequence, each reader gets something different out of that book because he himself supplies the answers. . . . It is an invitation to think -- not to believe." -- RICHARD E. NICHOLLS

 IN 1891, Abdul Rahman, the nominal governor of Riyadh, fled with his family from the city, then under the control of a hated rival. His son, the future King of Saudi Arabia, Abdul Aziz ibn Saud, made part of that journey in a bag hung on a camel. The Saud family wandered in exile until invited to the city-state of Kuwait, ruled by the Sabah family.
A hundred years later, the Sabahs fled across the same desert in their helicopters and Mercedes-Benzes just ahead of Saddam Hussein's Iraqi hordes. And the Sabahs, not reputed for their largeness of spirit, do not hesitate to remind their hosts of the old debt.
It would be totally out of character for the low-key present Saudi rulers, however, to say they expect assistance of a similar kind from their current American protectors. Yet as we learn in "The Prize," Daniel Yergin's timely book, long before the assurances of the Carter and Reagan Administrations, President Harry S. Truman virtually committed the United States to the defense of the Saudi realm. In 1950, he wrote to King Ibn Saud that Washington "is interested in the preservation of the independence and territorial integrity of Saudi Arabia," and that threats to the kingdom would be "a matter of immediate concern to the United States."
These are among the roots and cycles recaptured by Mr. Yergin in a work that deserves to become the standard text on the history of oil. Half historian and half energy expert, Mr. Yergin, the president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and the author of "Shattered Peace," is almost uniquely qualified for the task. "The Prize" exceeds in comprehensiveness and care the only comparable effort, a study (and a good one) about the major oil companies entitled "The Seven Sisters," by Anthony Sampson.
Historians will point out that Mr. Yergin essentially retells familiar stories. Economists will quibble about his failure to provide a theoretical apparatus to guide the reader through the various rounds of expansion and consolidation in the oil industry. Partisans will lament his avoidance of the charged debate over whether the oil barons and their political allies have been greedy devils or mostly instruments of market forces.
But Mr. Yergin's clear aim is not to break new ground, to theorize or to blame. It is to pull together a heretofore indigestible mass of information and provide a much-needed historical map. And he has done so with an eye toward the colossal personalities and forces that have drawn and redrawn that map.
There are, of course, the familiar figures, like John D. Rockefeller, the founder of Standard Oil, and J. Paul Getty and Armand Hammer, the famous independent oil tycoons. Very early in the tale of oil, a critical role is played by the Nobel brothers, Robert and Ludwig. Robert turned out to be instrumental in the development of the Baku oil fields in the Russian Caucasus, long before his guilt over being the dynamite king inspired his Nobel Prizes.
Not the least of the characters was Mohammed Mossadegh, chosen as Prime Minister of Iran in 1951, when the Shah was pushed aside and the oil fields nationalized. Truman dispatched Averell Harriman to explain to Mossadegh that he couldn't expect more for a barrel of oil than the oil companies earned. When told by Mr. Harriman that nothing can be larger than the sum of its parts, the Prime Minister responded, "That is false." Consider the fox, he continued. "His tail is often much longer than he is." And the Prime Minister laughed uproariously. He later explained to the American envoy that he could not survive if he compromised on oil pricing because of the power of the Ayatollah Seyed Kashani. Harriman, ever determined, visited the Ayatollah, who told him all foreigners were evil, and that those who interested themselves in oil could find themselves butchered.
Perhaps the most colorful of all the oil lions was Calouste Gulbenkian, a financier and deal-maker from Istanbul who played a pivotal role in bringing together money and oil before the turn of the century in Russia, and thereafter in the Middle East. His shrewdness earned him the sobriquet Mr. Five Percent. But for Mr. Yergin, his most endearing quality was his reputation for being "totally and completely untrusting."
Untrusting and, Mr. Yergin could have added, with a clearsighted understanding of the power of oil. Some of our most untrusting leaders never seemed to have grasped the point. After the outbreak of war between Israel and the Arabs in 1973, President Richard Nixon warned Arab oil producers that they wouldn't be able to sell their black gold at exorbitant rates. "We and Europe are the market," he said, and "if they continue to up the price they will lose the markets." A month later, the Arabs initiated their oil embargo and prices jumped to a historical high.
THE point was, and remains, that oil and not man has been in the saddle -- ever since man discovered it could be used to make light and fuel modern society. The point was, and is, that oil has meant more than fabulous wealth and power; it has created an umbilical dependency. Modern transportation, factories and food production feed on oil. Almost nothing that makes modern man and society go round can work without oil. In this way, it surpasses gold and coal and all the other precious resources that have driven history.
From this central insight, Mr. Yergin constructs his three themes. First, oil has been at the heart of "the rise and development of capitalism and modern business." Seven of the top 20 companies in the Fortune 500 are oil conglomerates. Since 1973, Saudi Arabia alone has earned over a trillion dollars from oil.
Yet Mr. Yergin does not say enough about why a nation like the Soviet Union has failed economically, though it remains the single largest oil producing country. Nor does he take full note of why Germany and Japan have thrived despite their enormous dependence on oil imports. The most disciplined nations manage quite well regardless.
The second theme of "The Prize" is the intimate relationship of oil with "national strategies and global politics and power." Here again, Mr. Yergin fails to explore how Germany and Japan were able to make themselves mighty militarily without oil. But the fact remains that the Allies defeated Germany in both world wars in no small measure because of German oil shortages. Japan went to war against the United States in 1941 in good part to establish secure oil supplies in Southeast Asia, and failed when Allied naval power cut off those supplies. And oil is so potent that a nation of 17 million like Iraq can support a force of a million men and the fourth most powerful military establishment in the world. Still, a much smaller country and one without oil, Israel, has been able to withstand the forces of the oil-rich Arab nations, including Iraq. Nonetheless, the theme generally holds.
It holds because of the truth of the third theme, that we have become a "Hydrocarbon Society," peopled by "Hydrocarbon Man." It is so in almost all things material. The interminable gas lines for autos during shortages, and the spiraling inflation and insuperable poverty of developing nations as oil prices rise, testify to the all-pervasive dominance of oil.
Mr. Yergin worries about this terrible dependency that so distorts our foreign policies and destroys our environment in an all-too-cursory concluding chapter. To the end, he does not want to step out of his role as historian and undermine the balance and integrity of his work. But he has left the reader with enough to take the next step.
There is the matter of the oil mentality and the matter of choice. The oil mind, with rare exceptions, has been marked with arrogance. It has taken the gift of the modern gods and turned it to power -- for windfall profits, against most kinds of government regulation and against the causes of conservation and environmentalism. It has inspired demons in the forms of the deposed and dead Shah of Iran, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya and Saddam Hussein.
For the United States and other nations to have mortgaged their environmental heritage to oil has been inexcusable. For the United States and others to have grown so dependent for their well-being on a part of the world that is politically unstable and enthralled by religious fanatics and terrorists has been an act of gargantuan irresponsibility. The very telling of the oil story as well as Mr. Yergin does it creates a sense of inevitability. But there have been alternatives, and there are alternatives -- nuclear power, solar power -- even now, especially now.
 
THE LONG ARM OF SADDAM HUSSEIN
 Daniel Yergin wrote out every word of "The Prize" in longhand. When typed, the first draft ran more than 2,500 pages (eventually cut by half), and Mr. Yergin read every chapter aloud to himself twice. Then, three days after he finished the epilogue, Saddam Hussein reached out for a prize of his own -- Kuwait.
For Mr. Yergin, Iraq's invasion four months before his book's publication meant a hectic end to a project that had consumed more than seven years and had become, in its author's eyes, a "narrative history of the 20th century."
"Oil and energy excite passions and animosity in our society like no other commodity," Mr. Yergin said during an interview over lunch in midtown Manhattan.
Despite the promise of alternative technologies that would decrease dependence on oil, Mr. Yergin predicts that "we will be an oil society much longer than we thought. If we weren't, we wouldn't have 400,000 troops in Saudi Arabia."
Mr. Yergin is the author of "Shattered Peace," a history of the origins of the cold war, and the co-author, with Robert Stobaugh, of the best seller "Energy Future." As an undergraduate at Yale, he studied English literature, with particular attention to the 19th-century novel, an influence that is apparent in "The Prize." But Mr. Yergin also flirted with new forms, and in 1967 he founded The New Journal in the wake of the New Journalism championed by Tom Wolfe and others. Later, he found himself sharing pages with Mr. Wolfe as a contributing editor at New York magazine.
Torn between journalism, business and the academic life, Mr. Yergin chose the academy when he won a Marshall Scholarship to Cambridge University, where he received his Ph.D. He has been a lecturer at the Harvard Business School and the John F. Kennedy School of Government. He has since returned to the business world, as president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an international consulting company that he started in 1982.
Mr. Yergin, whose two children were born during the writing of "The Prize," is now searching for a subject for his next book, about which he makes this promise, only half in jest: "It will be short." -- JOSEPH A. CINCOTTI

MISSION TO MARS
By Michael Collins.
Illustrated. 307 pp. New York:
Grove Weidenfeld. $22.50. 
 THE mission to Mars that Michael Collins foresees in his latest book would last almost two years: a two-month visit on the red planet would be sandwiched between an 11-month voyage there (via Venus) and a nine-month return. Mr. Collins, the Apollo 11 astronaut who orbited the moon while Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on it, reminds us that a trip to Mars "won't be the same as a lunar voyage, where home is still large enough and beautiful enough to act as a strong magnet for the eye and the mind." For months the crew would see "the same black velvet dotted with unblinking stars." And such isolation could "create frustration and hostility, perhaps followed by incapacitation, violence, or even insanity."
How should planners select people for such an ordeal? Should the crew include both sexes? Married couples? How can the spacecraft transport 65,000 pounds of food, drinking water and oxygen for the crew? Mr. Collins offers possible solutions to these and other problems that face humans bound for Mars. He does this by detailing a hypothetical mission, complete with a fictional international crew, that would take off in less than 14 years. His narrative allows even those who are not so interested in space travel to appreciate the complexity and the grandeur of the undertaking.
Mr. Collins has long been the articulate astronaut. In two previous books, "Carrying the Fire" and "Lift off," he described space flight in an energetic style that contrasted sharply with the monosyllabic utterances of many of his colleagues. Similarly, "Mission to Mars" is evocative of a real mission because he incorporates not only his own past but also the experiences of American and Russian astronauts, sailors on nuclear submarines and residents of Antarctica.
Unfortunately, this imaginary voyage takes up only half the book. The rest is a tepid polemic on why the great nations of the world should send people to Mars. It includes a brief summary of the scientific arguments for such a trip. (Anyone interested in a full account should read John Noble Wilford's recent book, "Mars Beckons.") But Mr. Collins's obsession with Mars stems less from an interest in science than from a desire to see the National Aeronautics and Space Administration win back the prestige it enjoyed when he himself played a starring role. A Mars trip, he writes, would be "the salvation of the agency."
Mr. Collins understands that "the decision to go to Mars will be made for political reasons," not economic ones. But he doubts politicians will back such a mission. He remembers attending a picnic on the White House lawn after listening to a speech by President Bush commemorating the 20th anniversary of Apollo 11: "Munching on a hot dog, I tried to digest what the president had said -- and not said." President Bush had endorsed NASA's plans to return to the moon and go on to Mars. "But what was missing," Mr. Collins says, "might be even more important: some indication of how high a priority his administration would put on space when the inevitable budget crunch came."
After offering that insight, which has been borne out by the recent budget decisions of Congress and the Administration, Mr. Collins returns to his hypothetical journey to Mars. As he sees it, twin spacecraft built by the United States and the Soviet Union would be flown by four married couples -- American, Soviet, French and Japanese. He explains that "an element of stability, of old-shoe comfort, would be introduced by having one's husband or wife to fall back on. Certainly a singles-bar atmosphere, a charged mixture of sexually unattached competitors, would be a disaster." (By contrast, the crew chosen to spend two years in Biosphere II, a closed ecological system in Arizona that, in many ways, is a model for a Mars mission, is four men and four women, all single.) As for the issue of command, Mr. Collins's desire to keep NASA in charge is so strong that he even allows a Soviet commander in exchange for keeping mission control in Houston.
On the oh-so-long voyage to Mars and back, Vladimir, Elena, Henri, Marina, Wesley, Heather, Sachi and Mariko encounter problems ranging from the deaths of loved ones back home to backups in the sewage and water-recycling systems. The intended high point, of course, is the landing on and exploration of Mars. But it struck me as ho-hum -- more people bounding around in a desolate environment with about one-third of Earth's gravity, another Apollo in a more distant place. Nonetheless, even a space cynic like me found Mr. Collins's descriptions of the challenges of a Mars mission fascinating.

HEADLINE: SCIENCE FICTION

BYLINE: By Gerald Jonas

 BODY:
Early on, one of the central characters in Kim Stanley Robinson's PACIFIC EDGE (Tor/Tom Doherty Associates, $18.95) declares, "There is no such thing as a pocket utopia." What he means is that an elitist paradise cannot survive for long as an island of perfection in an imperfect world. This sounds like a truism, yet Mr. Robinson spends the rest of the book bringing to life an appealing and perversely believable pocket paradise.
Most utopian visions make boring reading. Despite some attempt (typically in the opening chapters) to disguise philosophy as fiction, authors with an ax to grind tend to scant storytelling in favor of polemics. Ursula Le Guin's 1974 novel "The Dispossessed" is a modern exception that speaks to our emotions as well as our intellect. Ms. Le Guin placed her utopian society in jeopardy in a way that challenged the wider applicability of that society's ideals; Mr. Robinson engages our attention by focusing on the day-to-day labor of putting ideals into practice. 
 If the residents of El Modena (in late 21st-century southern California) live in paradise, it is only because they work so hard to defend their way of life. Like all Californians, Kevin and Doris and Hank and Gabriela and Alfredo and Ramona worry about economic development and land use and water rights; they know where their water comes from -- mostly far away -- and they understand the political arts of compromise and give-and-take. Mr. Robinson tells us just enough about their cooperative, town-meeting type of self-government to make it sound plausible without reducing it to a bloodless formula. The issue that splits the town is what to do about Rattlesnake Hill, the last unspoiled hilltop in the area.
What distinguishes Mr. Robinson's treatment of this conflict from dozens of overheated ecological-disaster scenarios is his sense of scale. He never equates the fate of a particular hill with the fate of civilization. Instead, through a blend of dirt-under-the-fingernails naturalism and lyrical magical realism, he invites us to share his characters' intensely personal, intensely local attachment to what they have. The result is a bittersweet utopia that may shame you into entertaining new hope for the future.
The membership of the Science Fiction Writers of America once voted Isaac Asimov's "Nightfall" the best science fiction short story of all time. Now, a half-century after the story's publication, we have the novel NIGHTFALL (Doubleday, $19.95), a collaboration between Mr. Asimov and Robert Silverberg.
The original story, written when Mr. Asimov was 21 years old, took off from a line of Emerson's: "If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore, and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God!" The whole point of the story was to invent a scientifically plausible solar system in which such an event could actually occur, and then turn Emerson's prediction on its head. The inhabitants of the planet Kalgash, whose system is blessed with six suns and who have no way of imagining a dark night, much less a sky emblazoned with stars, react to the periodic "nightfall" with a worldwide panic that all but obliterates civilization.
It was not only Emerson who took it on the chin in the original; the cocky scientists of Kalgash who thought they understood the universe were reduced to whimpering idiots by the immensities of time and space revealed when the last veil of sunlight dropped from their eyes.
Continuing the story into the days and weeks following the terrifying nightfall, Mr. Silverberg and Mr. Asimov have altered the trajectory of the narrative out of all recognition. Instead of a fable about intellectual pride that ends in a thought-provoking blackout, this novel offers a rather pedestrian chronicle of the efforts of the surviving scientists and their religious adversaries to put the eggshell of society back together again. Unfortunately, we have read something like this a hundred times before, in the subgenre of science fiction known as the post-collapse novel. In such novels, which have proliferated in recent years, the collapse of civilization is typically triggered by a nuclear holocaust or some ecological catastrophe like global warming. By a curious alchemy, the new ending has transformed the appearance of the stars that made the original story so memorable into what might be called a retroactive cliche.
WINTERLONG (Bantam Spectra, $4.95) by Elizabeth Hand is a post-collapse novel with a vengeance. The environment is shot to hell. Nuclear explosives and virus bombs have scrambled genes to produce some bizarre variants on the human standard. Remnants of warring governments still duel over the devastated terrain. And in the ruins of the City (Washington) a strange new civilization, cobbled together out of bits and pieces of the old, struggles to survive.
The overgrown Mall is now a "Narrow Forest," haunted by "lazars" and "geneslaves." The cavernous buildings, which have grown "heavy kudzu beards," now house Curators who preserve, with some degree of success, the old scientific knowledge. But the real center of this world, and of Ms. Hand's novel, is the houses of pleasure where all the technology that has not yet been turned into instruments of destruction has been placed in the service of lust.
The plot, which has as many twists as a mutated chromosome, deals with the re-emergence of magic (white and black) in a world familiar with the worst that science can do. The characters include several mad scientists, a military commander of surpassing maleficence, doomed decadents of every stripe, some not-so-innocent innocents and a few enigmas whose true nature may be revealed in the promised sequel.
Ms. Hand's style tends toward the ornate: "At the sound I start to turn, to break the reverie that binds me to this place, this tree stirred by a tainted wind riven from a bleak and noiseless shore." But her vision of children used and abused by malign forces is so strong it keeps bursting through the language to evoke not just horror and disgust but outrage and even -- a word much bandied about by inhabitants of the City -- empathy.
If Rod Serling ever came back from the Twilight Zone to take up his career where he left off, the result might be HER PILGRIM SOUL: And Other Stories (Tor/Tom Doherty Associates, $17.95) by Alan Brennert. Here are all the master's tics, recycled for today's brave new world. The title story (which was in fact adapted from a script for CBS-TV's recent revival of "The Twilight Zone") strikes just the right tone of stylistic and conceptual pretension. A brilliant computer scientist who has trouble connecting with flesh-and-blood people gets a lesson in love (complete with many pregnant ellipses, italicized emphases, stunned dashes and a dynamite tag line by W. B. Yeats) from a long-dead woman who haunts his holograms.
In another retread from "The Twilight Zone," a group of space explorers approaches a "sad, wounded" planet shrouded in pollution. A technician asks, "There was a name for this one, in one of the old languages, wasn't there, Professor?" The professor (quietly): "Earth. They called it Earth." After discovering that the dead world is haunted by its former inhabitants, the explorers somehow trigger a planetary rebirth, which they recognize as scientifically impossible: " 'It's as if something is . . . accelerating evolution, somehow,' Archer said. 'As if -- ' " Two more dashes, one italicized exclamation and an ellipsis later, the truth is suddenly apparent: "The oceans are swarming with . . . cyanobacteria," the precursors of all higher organisms. "For the Earth, the long night was over; and if she knew what strange dawn was about to break, she kept her counsel, and remained silent, silent as the dead."

STREETWISE
Race, Class, and Change in an Urban Community.
By Elijah Anderson.
276 pp. Chicago:
The University of Chicago Press. $19.95. 
 IN 1975, Elijah Anderson and his wife moved innocently enough into the gentrifying Philadelphia neighborhood that he calls the Village. The young black sociologist was drawn to the area for personal reasons of an ordinary kind: the attractive houses, central location and rising property values. Only after he moved in did he realize that he was also strangely fascinated by the integrated neighborhood and by its relationship with the nearby ghetto.
He found himself studying the two linked neighborhoods, informally at first and then in a professional way -- photographing, videotaping, frequenting bars and shops and precinct houses. In the 14 years that followed, he conducted scores of interviews -- with cops, drug dealers, street kids, middle-class homeowners and community leaders. He also participated actively in local affairs, giving up any pretense of scientific objectivity. The result is an excellent portrait of two communities. Mr. Anderson, who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania, calls it an ethnographic study -- and he has framed his perceptions with some sociological theory about the "underclass" -- but the sharpness of his observations and the simple clarity of his prose recommend his book far beyond an academic audience. Vivid, unflinching, finely observed, "Streetwise" is a powerful and intensely frightening picture of the inner city.
Mr. Anderson's observational skill serves him well wherever he goes, and his portrait of the gentrifying Village is wonderfully lifelike: one-time hippies turned into landlords, yuppies braving the city streets only when protected by their dogs. But by far the strongest chapters in the book, the newest no doubt for many readers and the most searing, are those set in the black community he names Northton. Mr. Anderson is able to make himself at home on the ghetto street corner, hanging out with a gang or chatting with middle-aged workmen who once served as role models for local youths, but no longer do. He interviews churchgoing ladies who are now afraid whenever they venture out of their apartments. He shows us the thinking of a teen-age mother and explains what it feels like to be an adolescent male on a dark street at night, waiting for a chance to prove one's toughness by assaulting the next passer-by. Most memorable and appalling is the section in which he takes us inside a filthy crack house and talks at length with a pitiful "coke whore."
The neighborhood that emerges from these vignettes is an utterly hellish place. Hemmed in by poverty, unable to find jobs, largely without hope for the future, the inhabitants of Mr. Anderson's inner city have sunk into a desperate and vicious way of life. Northton is a Hobbesian world where the predator is king and the most admired people are those who are most ruthless in exploiting others. Teen-age boys with no other way to prove their manhood pride themselves on how many girls they can impregnate and abandon. Drug dealers live by ensnaring others, enlarging their pool of customers by addicting friends and lovers. Wolf-pack attacks on whites are justified as sport. Common decency seems to have no hold on people; duplicity and trickery are a way of life -- even inside families and young couples.
Mr. Anderson's most telling description is of the typical drug dealer, now the role model for many ghetto teen-agers. He is "making money fast and scorning the law and traditional values. If he works, he does so grudgingly. . . . He is out to beat the next fellow. . . . To his hustling mentality, generosity is a weakness. . . . Self-aggrandizement consumes his whole being."
Mr. Anderson is a scrupulous guide, and he whitewashes nothing in his picture. And yet, for all his honesty, at times he seems to shy away from the moral conclusions indicated by his evidence. His theories about the ghetto poor lean heavily on the sociologist William Julius Wilson. Like Mr. Wilson, Mr. Anderson believes that the root of the problem is largely economic: a lack of dignified, well-paying jobs. This, combined with the weakening of traditional values (caused largely by the black middle class's departure), has so demoralized inner-city blacks that they cannot resist the temptations of the drug culture. Thus, for Mr. Anderson, it is the economy that is to be blamed for teen-age motherhood, crack-addicted babies and the endless crime that ravages both Northton and the Village.
TO a degree, certainly, he is right. Most young people in the ghetto probably cannot help themselves, cannot ignore peer pressure or pass up the crack pipe. Clearly there is little point in blaming them, and society ought to do all it can to help -- both economically and in other ways. But to rule out blame should not mean banishing any hope for choice or personal responsibility. And at times one can't help wondering whether Mr. Anderson does the poor a service by insisting that they have so little choice. In the same way, one asks oneself, is it fair to impute racism to those Village whites who have come to associate young black males with crime? Which side of the problem needs more urgent attention -- the whites' undoubtedly overgeneralized fear or the reality of high crime rates among black youths?
Much of the power of Mr. Anderson's portrait grows from his obvious personal anguish. He paints a tragically dislocated world, poignant above all because of the waste of life. His sympathy is not misplaced, but he sometimes seems distracted from the truth it reveals.

 BODY:
"HE'S REACHING way upscale," wrote Jay Cocks in Time magazine recently about today's fashionable male, "to Armani and Ralph Lauren and the heady heights of bespoke tailoring."
"You have to show up in Bond-age style," Paul Hirshson of The Boston Globe wrote about a promotional party for a James Bond film, "meaning bespoke tailoring for men and something slick and sexy for women." 
 "Times are tougher, flamboyance is out," Newsweek wrote, following the trend toward Duke of Windsor styling. "The suits are available 'off the peg,' but there is even a growing interest in made-to-order, 'bespoke' tailoring."
My interest is growing in whatever happened to cus tom, a word fading from our fashion vocabulary in a blizzard of British usage. Don't give me any of those non-U made-to-order suits; get away from me with that bottom-of-the-line custom blazer; to be suitably trendy, bespeak to me of bespoke tailoring.
No, I may not say "bespeak to me." One old sense of bespeak is "to foreshadow, foretell," as in "The President's move bespeaks action in the gulf." Another sense means "show, indicate." In a New York Times book review, John Maxwell Hamilton notes the paradox of the frequent theft of the Bible, the most stolen book of all: "The Good Book apparently bespeaks a merciful God."
Yet another sense of this offbeat word is "to ask for in advance" ("to bespeak the reader's patience") or the similar "to reserve, or book, seats before a performance." The seats that are taken, like the person betrothed to be wed, are said to be spoken for.
Now we are zeroing in on the meaning of bespoke, an adjective that means "ordered in advance" (I'll hear from the Squad Squad about that).
"The shoemaking trade," Chambers's Encyclopedia wrote in 1866, ". . . is divided into two departments -- the bespoke and the ready-made." A half-century later in London, the bespoke tailor was born (probably on Savile Row, famed home of tailoring establishments; the present Japanese term for a Western-style suit is sebiro).
Why are there so few linguistic customers for cus tom? That word, from the Latin consuescere, "to accustom," is akin to suus, "one's own," as in suicide, a form of which a political candidate wearing a bespoke suit in a working-class district commits.
The Custom Tailors and Designers Association of America claims to be the oldest trade association in the United States, and its executive director, Irma Lipkin, insists that custom is here to stay: "Bespoke is British for what Americans call custom."
But usage by usage, stitch by stitch, the Britishism is patching over our word. We may be left with customized -- "altered to fit" -- or with made to measure -- "tailored to specific measurements but not made on the premises for a specified customer." This bespeaks a victory for the Brits. (Is "Brits" an ethnic slur? I'd like to hear from Britons about that.)
 
Fluffya Slang
 PHILADELPHIANS ARE proud of their regional dialect, which is based on a pronunciation of compression; a "Fluffya Inkwire," for example, is what outlanders call a Philadelphia Inquirer.
A competing publication, The Fluffyadailynooz, has come up with an interesting slang usage unrelated to pronunciation. "Ex-Prosecutor's Plea Stalemated," goes a July headline of an article that was read with dread at the Department of Justice in Washington, where droves of Pennsylvania prosecutors recused themselves in the case. Then followed this subhead: "Won't Dime Drug-Using Pals, Feds Say."
What is the meaning of dime as a verb? "Since pay phones required 10 cents per call for many years," explains Francis J. Hanssens Jr. of that city, "the phrase to drop a dime on came to mean 'to inform on.' The Daily News apparently believes that, even standing alone, dime can be used in that sense."
I salute the headline writer; it's good to see a colorful bit of slang hang in there in the face of inflation. To stop on a dime is still with us, because the 10-cent coin is our smallest, and the phrase means "to stop short"; however, the dime store, or five-and-dime, is Old Slang. So is "Suddenly the dime dropped," said by one who was illuminated by understanding, as if the inserted coin finally operated the pay phone and the dial tone came on. (If anybody calls about this, I'll hit him with Really Old Slang: "It's your nickel.")
 
Rich Soak
 IN OUR ETYMOLOGICAL dig for the coinage of the phrase soak the rich, one member of the Nitpickers' League argued that only words, not phrases, could be the object of etymology.
More helpful were two Lex Irregs who nailed down the coinage. Joe Klein of New York magazine cites Thomas Kessner's book "Fiorello H. La Guardia and the Making of Modern New York," which reports that on March 10, 1932, the fiery Congressman from New York took the floor of the House to blast a tax bill and to add his own formula: "I am simply going to say, 'Soak the rich' "; he was denounced in The New York Times for those "wild and whirling words."
David Shulman, an avid phrasedick, comes up with the earliest known citation of the phrase as the compound adjective that populist politicians came to know and love, with this headline from the April 2, 1932, Literary Digest: "The 'Soak-the-Rich' Drive in Washington."
 
Mickey Mouse
 "THE LINES BETWEEN children's television and the Federal Government are blurred," Anna Quindlen wrote in The New York Times, ". . . and if people get the government they deserve, are we all Mickey Mouse?"
Whence Mickey Mouse as a symbol of childishness, and its use as a slang adjective with a meaning ranging from "cockamamie" to "rudimentary" to "unsophisticated"? The Oxford English Dictionary defines the Americanism as "something small, insignificant or worthless," but that misses the nuance of dismaying oversimplification.
The cartoon character with the alliterative name was created by Walt Disney in the late 1920's, and George Orwell turned the name into an adjective in 1936, writing of "a sort of Mickey Mouse universe where things and people don't have to obey the rules of space and time."
Mickey was a mouse, and mice are small; a Mickey Mouse spot became the smallest spotlight in a motion-picture studio. The phrase was used in World War II British military slang to describe complicated machinery, but this sense soon atrophied; the use of the cartoon character on inexpensive children's wristwatches gave it an added meaning of cheapness.
To go to the mouse's mouth about the source for the current sense of simplism, I shot a query to Dave Smith, the archivist for Disney Studios in Burbank, Calif.
"Carl Nater, who worked on our educational films during World War II, had an explanation," said Mickey's historian. "He said the Government once sent its accountants to the studio, and they were dismayed by the way we kept the books -- they found overhead charges for the office in New York, scribbled notes, that sort of thing. One of the accountants exclaimed, 'What a Mickey Mouse way of bookkeeping!' and that's how that sense of the phrase was born."

Mideast Crisis Makes Cruises Alter Course
Enthusiasm for taking cruises to the eastern Mediterranean has all but disappeared because of tensions in the Middle East. Two deluxe cruise lines, Crystal Cruises and the Seabourn Cruise Line, have responded by canceling their plans to operate ships in the region next year.
Duncan Beardsley, president of Seabourn, said, "People are still interested in the Mediterranean, but not the eastern part."
Seabourn, based in San Francisco, said it had rerouted six cruises of the Seabourn Pride, a 204-passenger ship, which had been scheduled to embark from Venice and make stopovers in Istanbul between May and August. Instead of Istanbul, Seabourn said the ship will make stopovers in Lisbon, Nice and other western Mediterranean ports.
Crystal, based in Los Angeles, said its 960-passenger Crystal Harmony, which was to make seven cruises in the eastern Mediterranean between August and November, would be recalled to the United States. Crystal said the ship would likely operate between New York and Montreal, with stopovers in New England. Before the tensions arising from Iraq's seizure of Kuwait, the ship's destinations were to have included Istanbul, Odessa and Alexandria.
"We are responding to our guests' requests," said Darlene Papalini, a Crystal spokeswoman. "There is just a reluctance to travel to the eastern Mediterranean." Both companies said passengers who had booked passage on the canceled cruises were being offered alternative routes or their money back.
 
Polar Voyage On Soviet Ship
Western passengers can travel aboard a nuclear-powered Soviet icebreaker when she sets off July 26, 1991, from Murmansk to Nome, Alaska, via the North Pole. After the voyage -- said to be the first complete transpolar voyage on any vessel -- the ship, the Sovetsky Soyuz, will depart from Nome (pending United States Government approval) on Aug. 19 and return to Murmansk through the Northeast Passage, bound for remote towns in northern Siberia, offshore islands and the North Cape of Norway.
The two 21-day voyages, offered by Salen Lindblad Cruising, will cost from $25,000 to $32,000 a person, depending on the choice of cabin.
The 500-foot vessel has 48 twin cabins, two lounges, a dining room, pool and sauna and lecture theater. The ship attains a cruising speed of 18.8 knots at sea and 10 knots through ice five feet thick.
The ship has two lounges as well as a dining room, two saunas, gymnasium, indoor pool and a 100-seat tiered lecture theater with stage. Information: Salen Lindblad Cruising, 203-967-2900 or 800-223-5688.
 
Eurailpass for Car and Trains
Eurailpass will introduce three programs for 1991 and expand its destinations. For the first time, the pass -- allowing unlimited train travel in 17 countries -- will be valid throughout unified Germany, including Berlin. Eurailpass also has introduced a EurailDrive Pass, which offers travelers the combined use of rail and rental car in 16 countries.
The program allows four days of rail travel and three days of Hertz car rental within a 21-day period. The per-person rate, when two or more people travel together, is $269 for an economy car, $289 for a small car and $299 for medium size. In this plan, the rental car may be returned to any city in the country where the car was picked up.
Eurailpass has also expanded its Youthpasses for next year. Travelers under the age of 26 may use the rail system for 15 individual days of second-class travel during a three-month period for a cost of $340; 30 days of travel during that period costs $540.
The declining value of the dollar has led to price increases for most other Eurailpasses. In 1991, the consecutive-day price structure will be: $390 for 15 days of first-class travel; $498 for 21 days; $616 for a month; $840 for two months, and $1,042 for three months. Fifteen days of first-class travel between April 1 and Sept. 30 will be $298 a person, for travel by three or more people. Further information may be obtained by writing: Eurailpass, Post Office Box 325, Old Greenwich, Conn. 06870.
 
Club France Offers Benefits
Francophiles can help the new American Center in Paris (opening in 1992) as well as earn benefits related to travel in France by joining the new Club France formed by the French Government Tourist Office. The annual membership of $65 includes a $15 contribution to the American Center. Membership benefits, which the tourist office says begin Jan. 1, include entry in monthly drawings for round-trip air tickets to Paris and for FrenchRail and rail-and-drive passes. Members also receive a subscription to the quarterly France Magazine, a newsletter and a Michelin Red Guide to France. Members also get reductions at certain hotels in France, room upgrades, or free breakfast or dinner at some establishments and shopping and car-rental discounts. To join, send a check for $65 payable to the French Government to the French Government Tourist Office, 610 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10020
 
A $6 Dinner In Prague
 PRAGUE -- The kosher restaurant in Prague's Jewish Town Hall, long a lunchtime haunt of tourists and local people, Jews and non-Jews alike, recently began serving evening meals. The dinnertime ambiance -- tablecloths, low lights and a pianist -- is more sophisticated than the clamor at lunchtime.
One simple set menu, changing daily, is available at lunch, which costs about $3.50. In the evening, there is a more ambitious choice of three set menus ranging from $2 to $6 and, unlike at lunch, alcoholic beverages are served. The $6 dinner, called the supermenu, includes appetizer, soup, fish, vegetables, main meat course, dessert and fruit, coffee or tea.
The restaurant, in a high-ceilinged, ground-floor hall of the bright pink Old Jewish Town Hall on Maiselova Street, is around the corner from the Old-New Synagogue and the various parts of the Jewish Museum, including the Old Cemetery. The Town Hall, originally built in the 16th century and still the headquarters of the Prague Jewish community, is a five-minute walk from the Old Town Square. -- RUTH GRUBER
 
Diversions For Children
For children who ask "Are we there yet?" the American Automobile Association offers a "Travel Activity Book," which includes pictures to color and a variety of puzzles and games. Most items in the 144-page book, which is organized by state, are related to travel and help introduce youngsters to geography, nature and history. The book can be purchased at many bookstores and at most A.A.A. offices. The list price is $4.95.
 
REPAIRING STORM DAMAGE TO VERSAILLES GARDENS
 PARIS -- A stroll through the gardens of Versailles as winter approaches reveals the results of efforts by gardeners who, with the help of volunteers, soldiers and Boy Scouts, have restored some of the beauty after a devastating storm last February. Winds of 100 miles an hour took 1,300 trees, including 39 along the Tapis Vert, the main axis of the garden between the chateau and the canal.
Gaps in the walls of trees that define the major areas of the garden designed by Andre Le Notre, the landscape architect, are to be found throughout the park, but the most serious damage was done to the bosquets, openings in the wooded parts containing fountains, statues and benches. The Room of the Chestnuts was left with no chestnuts at all.
However, the debris has been carried away and 40 new trees planted. A mix of other, faster-growing trees and some hardwood varieties have been set out. These new plantings allow one to feel something of the effect of the young Versailles, evoking the appearance of the garden under Louis XIV. The restoration work on the north side has proceeded more slowly than on the south. A substantial area is still closed to the public, and many fallen trees remain on the ground. Both Trianons also suffered important losses.
An informational exhibit has been set up by the staff of the chateau around the Basin of Apollo near the canal. It points out that this is the third time that Versailles has lost most of its old trees.
 The gardens are open until dusk every day; admission is free. -- GUY WALTON

HEADLINE: WINTER IN THE SUN;
A Guide to Island Water Sports

BYLINE: By STANLEY CARR

 BODY:
DEMANDS for more active vacations, spurred by the drive for fitness, have encouraged the growth of sports facilities for visitors to the Caribbean. The trend has helped develop water sports on all the islands. Most have dive shops, with beginners' and certification courses, as well as centers that put visitors on rented windsurfing boards and give them lessons, and organize sailing, snorkeling and water skiing.
How busy these enterprises are during the high season, which begins next weekend, will probably reflect the health of tourism generally in the islands this winter. Last season was disrupted by Hurricane Hugo, which caused extensive damage in the eastern Caribbean in September and dissuaded many vacationers from going anywhere in the region. The chilly economy in the United States threatens to discourage visits again, though tourism officials hope that high prices in Europe and the crisis in the Middle East may impel travelers to substitute the Caribbean for a trip across the Atlantic and help produce a good season. "We're safe," said Marcella Martinez, the spokeswoman in New York for the Caribbean Tourism Organization, "and we're nearby." 
 Despite the slower economy, American Airlines and the San Juan Port Authority in Puerto Rico are cooperating on plans to expand American's San Juan hub at the Luis Munoz Marin Airport, which the airline made the focal point of its Caribbean route network, starting in 1986. The hub, established in 1986, has allowed American to add Caribbean flights from cities other than New York and has increased the number of flights from San Juan to many of the islands.
Robert Crandall, president of American, said last month that the hub would be enlarged to about four times its current size. Plans range from a new passenger concourse and more wide-body gates to new customs facilities. The Port Authority has announced it will build a new control tower, a new hotel and a parking lot for 4,000 cars.
Connections from Puerto Rico or from St. Martin are vital to islands like Montserrat, Dominica, St. Eustatius, Martinique and Guadeloupe, which do not have direct service from the United States. Martinique and Guadeloupe will have a direct flight once a week from Kennedy International Airport starting next Saturday, on Minerve Airlines, a French charter company.
The following review of some of the water sports facilities in the Caribbean and the Bahamas ranges from the haunts of dedicated scuba divers on Bonaire in the Netherlands Antilles and windsurfing lessons in Antigua to chartering fishing boats on French St. Martin and sailboats in the British Virgin Islands. The hotels and resorts listed generally have water sports or beaches or both to offer.
Unless otherwise stated, their room rates are for a double room per day. Many hotels also offer M.A.P. (Modified American Plan), providing breakfast and dinner at an additional daily cost.
Throughout the Caribbean room taxes imposed by island governments are added to hotel bills and these vary from 5 to about 12 percent. Many hotels also add a service charge that theoretically absolves the visitor from tipping and is usually around 10 percent. In the Dominican Republic, for example, hotels add a service tax of 10 percent and a Government tax of 11 percent (and restaurants generally charge 10 percent service as well as a 6 percent tax).
But the republic's all-inclusive resorts usually include taxes and service, as the all-inclusive resorts do elsewhere, including Jamaica (where there are 11 of them). Vacationers should check on taxes and service when they make reservations.

Overview
 Three wrecked ships that were aground at Sandy Ground and a fourth that was lying on its side in shallow water -- and obstructing the view -- in Road Bay were refloated and sunk as artificial reefs in the reef system this year. The four vessels, which are now dive sites, were cleaned of oil and other environmentally damaging material and sunk in waters 60 to 110 feet deep. They have already atracted schools of fish. The 35-square-mile island has several other wrecks and walls as well as reefs that serve as dive sites. One site, Prickly Pear, is an underwater canyon with ledges and caverns at from 30 to 70 feet. At Grouper Bowl, at 25 to 50 feet, larger groupers are found among the overhangs and small caverns.
Most of the hotels on this island near St. Martin offer water sports, although the Mariners at Sandy Ground has more equipment and is more water-oriented than most. Meads Bay, site of the Malliouhana and the Carimar Beach Club, is favored by sailors and windsurfers. The Coccoloba Plantation resort's beach is rated excellent for snorkeling, and so is Shoal Bay, home of Shoal Bay Villas and the Fountain Beach Hotel, and Rendezvous Bay, because of its point jutting out to deeper water. The Cinnamon Reef Beach Club is noted for its windsurfing.

Hotels
 The 50-room Mariners provides snorkeling equipment, Sunfish sailboats and Mistral windsurfers for guests, and a Mistral instructor is available. For daytime and sunset sails, the hotel has a 49-foot catamaran, the Princess Soya, which was used recently for a marriage ceremony. Room rates at the Mariners are $215 to $250 a day for a double. Breakfast and dinner costs another $45 a person a day.
Other rates, for two: Malliouhana, from $450; Carimar, $285 for a one-bedroom apartment; Coccoloba, from $360 with full breakfast; Shoal Bay Villas, $195, and Fountain Beach, $210.
 
Transportation
 From New York on American or Pan American to San Juan and St. Maarten (Dutch), then on American Eagle from San Juan and on Windward Island Airways from St. Maarten. From Antigua on L.I.A.T., from St. Thomas with Air B.V.I. and Windward, from St. Kitts on L.I.A.T. Daily boat services from Marigot (St. Martin); $8 one way.

Overview
 Sailing, windsurfing, snorkeling, scuba diving, water skiing and deep-sea fishing are all available on this 108-square-mile island, the largest in the Leeward Islands. The island says it has a beach for every day of the year, and describes itself as the sailing capital of the Caribbean. Antigua Sailing Week, held at English Harbour in late April, is the Caribbean's largest regatta and attracts some of the world's fastest yachts. Several of the island's many hotels offer a variety of craft for rent, with or without crews. The Antigua School of Sailing has lessons for beginners and the experienced; its programs include a six-day course aboard a ship.
A number of cruises, most of which last several hours and include lunch and sightseeing, ply the island's jagged coast. One of the boats is the Falcon, which does sunset and day cruises to Barbuda, Antigua's small sister island.
For windsurfing, the sheltered west coast is right for beginners, while the Atlantic rollers that come in on the east shore challenge advanced surfers. Lessons are available at some hotels, including the Jolly Beach Resort and Lord Nelson's Beach Hotel (Patrick Scales Water Sports).
Scuba diving and snorkeling enthusiasts find accessible shallow reefs as well as deep coral canyons, caves and wrecks. Among the many sites around the coast are Thunderhead, a wreck-strewn site in only 35 feet of water with sloping hard corals, and the Chimney, a small cave 60 feet down with sponge-filled gullies descending to 80 feet. Among several dive shops offering lessons, equipment rental and guided dive trips are the Aquanaut Diving Centers at the Galleon Beach Club, the Ramada Renaissance Royal Antiguan and the St. James Club; Dive Antigua at the Halcyon Cove Hotel, Dive Runaway at the Runaway Beach Club and the Long Bay Dive Shop at the Long Bay Hotel.
Water skiing, jet skiing and parasailing are available at a number of hotels and such sports centers as the Wadadli Watersports Center at Buccaneer Cove and Unlimited Hydro Sports at Dickenson Bay and Jolly Beach. Nicholson Yacht Charters is one of the charter boat companies that arrange deep-sea fishing for grouper, snapper and other fish.
 
Hotels
 Antigua has a large selection of accommodations and most have water sports programs. Some water sports are complimentary at Antigua Village, a Mediterranean-style condominium resort amid palm trees and bougainvillea at Dickenson Bay. One- and two-bedroom villas sleep up to six people. Reservations: R.S.I, 212-661-4540.

(212-246-3030)
 
Overview
 This originally Dutch island 15 miles north of Venezuela has increased its number of visitors for five consecutive years. Swimming and sightseeing on foot or with rental scooters are the main daytime activities.

THE BAHAMAS
 
BAHAMAS TOURIST OFFICE
150 EAST 52d STREET, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10022
 (212-758-2777)
 
Overview
 The real beauty of the Bahamas lies not in its history or its mix of island architecture, food and folklore but in its waters. Most of the water is very shallow with a sandy bottom (the word Bahama comes from the Spanish baja mar, meaning shallow waters), making the colors of the sea breathtaking hues of green and blue. In general, the farther north in the chain of 700 islands you go, the deeper the water is, making it safer for charter boat cruising, while the farther south, the more dramatic the colors of the water.
The capital, Nassau, is on the island of New Providence, a major tourism and offshore banking center with three principal resort areas: Cable Beach, known as the Bahamian Riviera, Paradise Island, and on the south side of New Providence, Divi Bahamas, which attracts sports enthusiasts. Visitors who want a quiet vacation might prefer to stay in a smaller resort or inn on one of the Family Islands. They won't find casinos and night life on the Family Islands, but they will discover the fun of trying to catch a slippery bonefish. Almost all the resorts have a variety of water sports activities including snorkeling, water skiing, sailing (most have Sunfish, Hobie cats and sailboards or similar boats for rent). Parasailing, banana boat rides and jet skis are available along the Bahamian Riviera and Paradise Island, where boats, kept at a safe distance from swimmers, pick up visitors who want to venture to a reef or island nearby.
 
Hotels
 New Providence. Each of the hotels along the Bahamian Riviera is quite different, from the razzle-dazzle Carnival's Crystal Palace, home of the world's most expensive hotel suite, a $25,000-a-night fantasy complete with Ursula the robot who passes you a towel as you step out of the bath. Regular room rates are $175 to $315, depending on room and time of week. Two meals are available at $36 a person a day. Crystal Palace has 13 restaurants, fitness center and sports including snorkeling, water skiing, banana boats, jet skis, parasailing and sailing. Nearby, but much quieter, is the Meridien Royal Bahamian Hotel, where tea is served in the lobby of the Manor House at 4 P.M. The hotel has a smallish beach, but a complete water sports program. Room rates range from $165 a day to $380; villas are $500.
Divi Bahamas is a sprawling 220-acre resort with the most complete scuba diving program on New Providence. Rooms are $280 a day. Except for dive trips, water sports are included.
On the Family Islands. On Windermere Island, Eleuthera, a guard raises the gate over the single-lane bridge to admit you to the Windermere Island where the private club awards temporary membership to stay in the hotel. This is where Prince Charles and the Princess of Wales spent their honeymoon. The island is five miles long and no more than a half-mile wide. On one side lies the Atlantic Ocean trimmed in five uninterrupted miles of pinkish-white sand. On the leeward side is another beach, a dock and full water sports facilities. Except for a private bonefishing guide ($40), water sports are included in the room rate. There is sailing, kayaking, canoeing, snorkeling, windsurfing (12 new sailboards), six tennis courts.

Overview
 The sheltered west coast is ideal for water sports ranging from Hobie Cat and Sunfish sailing, jet skiing, parasailing and scuba diving to riding the banana -- a plastic tube pulled by speedboat -- deep-sea fishing and windsurfing. Windsurfing has really caught on in Barbados because of the constant breezes offshore, although it's necessary to go a good distance out on the west coast to catch a good breeze. The south coast, especially as one moves southeasterly, becomes choppy with a stiff breeze and is also favored by many small-boat sailors and windsurfers. The big waves of the east coast provide good opportunities for wave surfers, many of whom like an area called the Soup Bowl at Cattlewash that's noted for surfing, boogie boarding and body surfing.
Scuba divers examine the marine life in the island's coral reefs and in three sunken wrecks, including the freighter Stavronikita near Folkestone Underwater Park, a marine reserve just off the St. James coast devoted to research and protection of marine life as well as recreation.
Most hotel beaches and other beaches on the west and south coasts -- but not east and north -- offer good swimming. Recommended beaches for picnicking and swimming are: Brandons at Brighton in St. Michael; Rockley Beach, Enterprise (also known as Miami) Beach in Christ Church, and the Crane Beach and Long Bay in St. Philip.
On the south coast at Silver Sands, the Silver Rock Windsurfing Club charges $15 for use of a windsurfer for an hour and also rents wave skis at $5 an hour. Windsurfing lessons -- only in the high-performance category because of the lively waves here -- are $30 an hour; contact Brian Talma (809-428-2866).
Grand Barbados Beach Resort (809-426-9947) runs a scuba diving school where the rates are $50 for a resort class and one dive ($20 for class only), $350 for a certification course, $40 for daily dive trips (or $35 for divers with own equipment), $40 for night dives and $140 for a six-dive package, with all equipment supplied.
The Club Mistral (809-428-7277) is a windsurfing club for intermediate to advanced sailors that also operates at Silver Sands Hotel (809-428-6001). Deep-sea fishing trips are arranged by Jolly Roger Watersport at both the Colony Club, St. James (809-422-2335), and at Sunset Crest (809-432-7090).

Hotels
 The 130-room Grand Barbados at Carlisle Bay on the west coast charges from $220 for a double room. Sailing, scuba instruction and snorkeling equipment are provided.

Its remarkable coral passages and large variety of sea life, coupled with availability of equipment, has been attracting experienced divers for four decades. Almost any area of Bonaire is ideal for diving. Three good swimming sites are Pink Beach, Playa Dachi and Dac Bay.

Overview
 Diving, snorkeling and other water sports are major attractions on the Caymans, a British colony of three islands, which are circled by coral walls and feature a variety of marine life. Shallow water surrounds the islands and the coral walls mark the dropoff into deep water about 500 yards off shore. From the walls, divers can share sightseeing with eagle rays, turtles and other sea creatures.

Overview
 Windsurfing sailboards, invented in 1969 by two Californians, have given this southern Caribbean island its national sport. Curacao's larger resort hotels offer guests windsurfing along with other water sports and one is host to two annual pro-amateur windsurfing competitions attracting entrants from Europe and Asia as well as the Americas. The best place to windsurf is in the Marie Pompoen area near the Seaquarium.
A Dutchman, Freek Born, who runs Top Water Sports Curacao at Seaquarium Beach (telephone, 617343), teaches windsurfing to beginners at $20 an hour -- and believes the island has become the Caribbean capital of the sport. He rents Sunfish boats at $10 an hour and stocks snorkel gear, Hobie Cat craft, catamarans, paddle boards and floating mats.
The island has eight good beaches for swimming: Santa Marta Bay, Sherami, Kenapa, Caracas Bay, West Punt, Jan Thiel, Rif (Reef) and Spanish Water.
The Curacao Underwater Park, established in 1983 to safeguard hundreds of acres of coral reef and inner bay, includes 16 dive sites.

Overview
 The 29-mile-long mountainous island between Guadeloupe and Martinique is very different from the Dominican Republic, with which it is often confused. It attracts nature lovers to its hiking trails, waterfalls, rivers and a 16,000-acre rain forest set aside as a national park. Underwater, it boasts hundreds of varieties of reef fish, masses of black coral, hard and soft corals and deep seafans. Diving must be undertaken through one of the island's registered operators or with written permission from the Fisheries Division. Dive centers are at the Castle Comfort Dive Lodge, Picard Beach Cottage Resort, Portsmouth Beach Hotel, Anchorage Hotel and Castaways Beach Hotel.

Overview
 The United States dollar remains strong against the Dominican peso. Tourists are cautioned, however, not to exchange currency with street hawkers. Tourism is the country's largest industry.
In the capital, Santo Domingo, the most popular beach with local people is Boca Chica, about 30 minutes southwest of the city, and when they want a picnic lunch they buy fresh fried fish, fried plantains and johnny cakes (a fried, thin dough) from the women merchants who cook on the spot. Some Santo Domingo hotels offer transport to Boca Chica Beach.
In the capital area, a group called Actividades Marinas del Caribe (A.M.C.) offers scuba diving packages. You would have to provide your own air travel and hotel. A.M.C. plans dives in the National Marine Park in La Caleta, where visitors explore the coral reef bottom and see two colonial-era wrecks and cannons. A four-day scuba diving package at $400 includes dives at La Caleta, La Romana and Bayahibe. A.M.C. can be reached at Post Office Box 21449, La Caleta National Park, La Caleta, Dominican Republic (809-530-1837).

Overview
 Grand Anse Beach, a mile long, 10 minutes from the capital, St. George's, and heart of the island's hotel development, is the best beach for swimming, snorkeling, water skiing, wind surfing and other water sports. Grand Anse is also ideal for scuba excursions to the wreck of the ocean liner Bianca C one mile offshore in about 100 feet of water.
Several other beaches on the southern tip are within easy reach by car and good for swimming, snorkeling and picnicking. Among them are La Sagesse and the Morne Rouge. The Atlantic beaches on the north and east coasts offer surf bathing and a greater seclusion for picnics. All beaches are open to free use. The sister island of Carriacou, an 18-minute flight away, has unspoiled bgeaches and good opportunities for snorkeling.
Yachts may be chartered from Grenada Yacht Services (809-440-2508), Spice Island Marine Services (809-444-4342) or The Moorings (809-444-4449).

Overview
 The most popular scuba dives are at Pigeon island off the west coast, which Jacques Cousteau has called "one of the world's 10 best" diving areas. On the beach at Malendure, facing the island are three schools with licensed instructors: Les Heures Saintes (98.86.63), Chez Guy (98.81.72) and the Nautilus Club (98.85.69). Scuba schools are also based at some of the large hotels, including Aqua-Fari at La Creole Beach (84.26.26). The Centre Nautique des Saintes is on the small island of Terre de Haut just off the southern coast of Basse-Terre, one of the two islands making up Guadeloupe; the other is Grande-Terre.
Sailboats, crewed or bareboat, are plentiful. Full-day picnic sails on the trimaran Grande Voile are organized by local tour operators, as are trips on glass-bottom boats, such as the Tamarin, with morning and afternoon departures, and the Papyrus, offering day and moonlight sails. Snorkeling is especially rewarding at St. Francois reef and the Ilet du Gosier, offshore from the Gosier hotels. Glass-bottom boats are used for snorkeling trips to Pigeon Island.
Deep-sea fishing: The season for barracuda and kingfish is January to May; for tuna, dolphin and bonito, it is December to March. Hotel desks will recommend such deep-sea fishing boats as the Thalassa, based in Bas du Fort at the Port de Plaissance Marina (82.74.94). The best spots for surfing are at Moule, Port Louis and Anse Bertrand. Contact: Philip Caze, Comite Guadeloupeen de Surf (91.77.64.).
Three marinas have been added to the facilities already available at Pointe-a-Pitre's Carenage and at Deshaies on Basse-Terre. Largest is the Bas du Port de Plaisance, with 700 berths, 55 of which are available for visiting boats. The winds and currents of Guadeloupe tend to be strong and it's a true sailor who worships these waters.
There are many beaches, from the dark sands of western Basse-Terre to the long white stretches encircling Grande-Terre. Public beaches are generally free, though some may charge for parking. Unlike hotel beaches, they have few facilities. Hotels welcome non-guests but charge for changing facilities.
 
Hotels
 The Hamak Beach Hotel in St. Francois offers free water sports, except water skiing, in a seven-night package that costs from $1,540 to $2,380 for two people (not including air fare) through Caribbean Inns, Box 7411, Hilton Head, S.C. 29938 (803-785-7411).

Overview
 A general election in Haiti is scheduled for Dec. 16. Political unrest since 1985 has devastated the tourist industry, but the country's deserted beaches remain beautiful and service continues to be friendly and courteous. Haiti is for the independent, adventurous traveler, not for those who want constant planned activities and entertainment.
The Macaya Beach Hotel has closed; Club Med's 350-room Magic Isle facility has been closed since August 1987. In Port-au-Prince, the famous Hotel Oloffson and the Holiday Inn-Le Plaza have a steady flow of guests. United States dollars are acceptable everywhere, but change will most likely be given in local currency.
Divers find a vast variety of sponges, coral and fish, and there are spectacular wall dives at Amani'y and La Gonave Island.

Overview
 Jamaica has a wealth of beaches and water sports to match the size of its coastline -- the island is 146 miles long and up to 51 miles across at its widest. Visitors intrigued by fine beaches for swimming and picnicking should spend time at Bloody Bay at Negril on the west coast, the Doctors Cave and Cornwall Beaches in Montego Bay, Mallards Beach in Ocho Rios, Puerto Seco in Discovery Bay, all on the north shore, and San San Beach in Port Antonio in the northeast. Kingston has Hellshire Beach. While no charge is made at Bloody Bay or Hellshire, entrance fees of around 50 cents and 25 cents for children are charged at the others.
The all-inclusive resorts -- those where the rates include all meals and sports -- offer some of the best scuba-diving facilities for beginners or those wishing to experiment for a day. For the experienced, offshore diving is best along the north and west coasts, particularly Negril. The Negril Scuba Center (809-357-4425) at the Negril Beach Club offers a variety of diving packages for the novice and certified diver. Prices, as at most diving centers, include tanks, weights, boat ride and guide, and on average range from $30 to $50 for a single dive to from $95 to $400 for dive packages. The Airport Reef near the Montego Bay airport, with its mass of coral caves, tunnels and canyons, is considered by some divers to be the best site. Port Royal, near Kingston, the capital, has sunken ships that are a haven for tropical fish and an objective for divers.

Morgan's Harbour Hotel in Port Royal on the south coast is favored by some divers because of its proximity to the site of an old port that was a haunt of buccaneers before its destruction by an earthquake in 1692. Many lives were lost and much of the town disppeared beneath the sea. Today the remains of buildings and other relics can be seen underwater. In addition to diving, snorkeling and other water sports, the hotel has a marina for 85 boats. Room rates are from $90 to $165. A number of packages are available, including a seven-night diver's plan that costs $975 a person, double occupancy, and includes five offshore dives with an instructor as well as three meals daily.

Overview
 There are scuba facilities with licensed instructors at Bathy's Club in the Meridien, at Oxygene Blue in Le Bakoua, and on the Planete Bleue boat, all in Pointe du Bout. The U.C.P.A. diving operation is installed on the beach behind the Christophe Colombe Hotel and at Club Marouba, both in Carbet on the northwestern coast; and Tropicasub operates out of the Hotel La Bateliere north of Fort-de-France, as well as next to La Guinguette restaurant in St.-Pierre. In the south, there are scuba operations at Club Mediterranee (for guests only) near Ste.-Anne and at the Diamant-Novotel's Sub Diamond Rock.
Memorable dive spots include Ilet la Perle and the shipwrecks off St.-Pierre in the north, Cap Salomon and Anses d'Arlets on the southwest coast, Diamond Rock and Ste.-Anne in the south. Individual dives average about $50 but most places offer full scuba packages.
Sunfish, sailfish or hobie cats can be rented by the hour from hotel beach shacks; yachts that come bareboat or equipped with a full crew can be chartered by the day, week, or month. Daylong sailing excursions set out from the Marina Pointe du Bout, the Meridien, the Hotel La Bateliere, and other spots, for St.-Pierre in the north and Diamond Rock in the south. A sample full-day trip on the catamaran Micaline, the three-masted schooner Toumelin (telephone, 66.02.85 for either) or the schooner Captain Cap (66.00.00) might include a stop for snorkeling or swimming and a beach picnic lunch and cost of $55 to $60 a person. Affaires Maritimes (71.90.05) is a good source for nautical information, including trips on typical Martinique fishing yawls.
Martinique's capital, Fort-de-France, is a favored harbor with yachters and a point of origin for charter yachts sailing to St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Among outfitters with yacht charters and boat rentals are: Avimer, Le Bakoua Hotel, Pointe du Bout, 97229 Trois-Ilets (66.05.45); A.T.M., Port de Plaisance du Marin, 97290 Le Marin (74.98.17), which offers the largest fleet, more than 100 boats, and Caraibes Evasion, Pointe du Bout, 97229 Trois Ilets (66..02.85), with Zodiacs, cabin cruisers and sailboats, crewed or uncrewed for 6 to 60 persons.

Overview
 Montserrat lost most of its greenness to the devastation of Hurricane Hugo in September last year. The growth on this mountainous, 39-square-mile island has almost completely recovered, but repairs to smashed homes and tourist accommodations are still going on. Most visitors' rooms -- limited at the best of times -- are expected to be ready this month. Meanwhile, unchanged are the opportunities for windsurfing, sunfish sailing, water skiing, snorkeling, body surfing, board paddling, scuba diving and deep-sea fishing. Rendezvous Bay, with its white sands, Lime Kiln and Woodlands are the best beaches for snorkeling, diving and picnics; Foxes Bay and Little Bay are used for for spearfishing. The most popular beach is the sheltered Old Road Bay, which sports a small jetty, and offers everything from diving lessons to day sails. It has a beach bar, as well as a tennis court and is close to the golf course.
Danny's Watersports (809-491-5645) offers rentals and lessons in windsurfing, snorkeling, sailing and water skiing from $5 to $10 an hour. Its scuba-diving instructor teaches and rents equipment at from $35 to $55 a dive.
Visitors this month can be a part of the island's annual carnival. Throughout December there are calypso contests, pageants, masquerade dancers and parades with floats. The recently opened disco called Uprising presents reggae and calypso artists from other islands.
 
Hotels
 The Vue Pointe overlooking Old Road Bay offers the best opportunities and facilities for those who want to swim, dive, ski, surf, sail and fish. Room rates range from $75 to $200. The more modern Montserrat Springs Hotel on the edge of Emerald Isle Beach and within walking distance of Plymouth lends itself well to picnics and beach parties, has good snorkeling and spearfishing and can arrange windsurfing and water skiing. The hotel added some rooms as it carried out repairs and plans a Dec. 15 opening with 22 rooms. By March it hopes to have 46 rooms. Rates range from $110 to $280 a night.

PUERTO RICO
 
COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO TOURISM COMPANY
575 FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10017
(212-599-6262)
 
Overview
 With the Atlantic on its north coast and the Caribbean on the south coast, Puerto Rico has hundreds of miles of sandy beaches. The surf in the north tends to be rough while the waters in the south are usually smooth. The temperature of the water is normally the same as that of the air, which from November to March varies from about 76 to 85 degrees, making it ideal for water sports.
The island suffered billions of dollars in damage from Hurricane Hugo in September last year, but none of the major hotels were so badly damaged that they had to close. The island is now almost fully recovered. Suffering greater devestation were the little islands of Vieques and Culebra off the east coast, which have miles of beaches for snorkeling, scuba diving, fishing and sunbathing and swimming. The hotels were damaged but are open for business, and the rebuilding of the destroyed and damaged homes is about 80 percent complete.
Puerto Rico has some of the world's best beaches for surfing. Beginners would do well to stick to the beach at the foot of Condado Avenue in the Condado hotel district. More accomplished surfers may want to drive out to Tubos, a beach off Route 685 north of the town of Vega Baja, about an hour's drive from San Juan. Expert surfers might prefer Puntas, called the Hawaii of the east, outside Rincon on the westernmost tip of the island. Surfers go there for months at a time staying in ramshackle rooms rented from families with homes near the beach. Rooms at the nearby Villa Cofresi (809-823-7045) go for $75 in the winter season.
Most visitors to Puerto Rico stay in hotels in the San Juan area which also includes those in the Isla Verde section. All the luxury hotels have water sports concessions offering skin diving and scuba diving lessons that include excursions to diving beaches. Castillo Watersports (809-791-7195), near El San Juan Hotel in Isla Verde, offers a 40-hour scuba course with ocean dives for $275. Castillo also offers a snorkeling picnic, with lunch and drinks, from a native sloop for three costing $60 a person. The same trip for scuba divers costs $85 a person.
At the Condado Plaza Hotel and Casino in the heart of the Condado hotel area, San Juan Watersports rents water scooters for use in the Condado Lagoon for $40 a half-hour and water skis and tow boats for $25 for 15 minutes. Windsurfers are rented for $20 an hour.
Coral Head Divers (809-850-7208), at the sprawling Palmas del Mar resort in the southeast coast town of Humacao, rents Sunfish and windsurfers for $20 and kayaks for $10 an hour. It also offers a variety of scuba and snorkeling trips and an open-water scuba certification course for $375. Coral Head also has a combination snorkeling and fishing trip to the island of Vieques on a cabin cruiser for $79 a person.
At the Hyatt Regency Cerromar, in the town of Dorado about 30 minutes west of San Juan, windsurfers, paddle canoes, ocean kayaks and water trikes are free to guests in season. Lisa Tenfield, a world-champion windsurfer, offers a 90-minute beginner's windsurfing course for $45 and an eight-hour certification program for $139.
Vieques is good for snorkeling and scuba diving but divers have to take their own gear: there are no rental facilities on the island. At Esperanza, a little fishing village on the south coast, you can snorkel for lobster and fish right off the Villa Esperanza Hotel. Windsurfing boards and other gear may be rented at the hotel.
Well known for deep-sea fishing charters is Mike Benitez (809-724-6265), who sails out of the San Juan Yacht Club just off the Condado hotel district. A half day for six on his 45-foot boat costs $366 while a full day is $650. A half day for six on his 61-footer is $625; a full day, $1,200. At Palmas del Mar, Bill Burleson (809-850-7442) can take six passengers on his 48-foot boat for $795 for a full day and $595 for six hours.
In Vieques, the Villa Esperanza Hotel (809-741-8675) arranges for a fisherman to take a party of six out for a half day for $250 and a full day for $350.
 
Hotels
 El San Juan Hotel and Casino (809-791-1000 or 800-468-2818), one of the island's veteran hotels, underwent a major face lift that included gardens designed by Edward Durrel Stone Jr. You don't have to leave the hotel for a varied night life or a far ranging choice of restaurants, of which there are five, the latest being the Don Juan. Rates start at $275 daily.
In addition to their water sports, the Hyatt Regency Cerromar (809-796-1234), in Dorado, and Palmas del Mar (809-852-6000), near the southeast coast town of Humacao, are resorts with several golf courses, tennis courts and horseback riding facilities. The rates at the Hyatt start at $225 and at Palmas del Mar at $120 for a room up to $520 for a villa accommodating six people.
Villa Esperanza Hotel in Vieques charges $96 a day for a room, with two children under 10 permitted in the room at no additional cost.

(800-344-4606)
 
Overview
 The five-square-mile island 20 miles south of St. Maarten, having no permanent beaches, draws more than 20,000 tourists a year to its dive sites and mountain hiking trails and simply to the island itself as a day trip from neighboring islands. A marine park was established by the Government of Saba in 1987 to protect a zone along the coast and to regulate its use by fishermen and water-sports lovers. There are 14 designated dive sites. Shallow water near shore mirrors the steep sides of the island above the surface and dropping near vertically into the ocean. Coral reefs, dropoffs, walls and pinnacles are a short boat ride away.
Saba is the only island in the Eastern Caribbean with a recompression chamber, acquired from the Royal Dutch Navy last year. The island has three dive shops and the hotels offer package deals for divers. The dive shops are Wilson's (599-5-22167), Saba Deep (599-4-63347) and Sea Saba (599-4-62246). Single-tank dives are $45. An example of packages available is Sea Saba's six nights and eight dives at $528 a person, double occupancy, including accommodations, guided boat tours, tanks and weight belt, refreshments, hotel service charges, room tax, marine park fees and airport and diving taxi service.

ST. BARTHELEMY
 
FRENCH WEST INDIES TOURIST BOARD
610 FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10020
(212-757-1125)
 
Overview
 St. Bart's popularity in the world of yachting is due in part to its being about midway between Antigua and Virgin Gorda, two major sailing centers. Gustavia's harbor, 13 to 16 feet deep, has mooring and docking facilities for about 40 yachts. There are also fine anchorages at nearby Public, Corossol and Colombier. For anything connected to yachting, Loulou's Marine in Gustavia (27.62.74) is the place. The stock is extensive, the staff speaks English and the bulletin board is a trove of yachting information. Other good sources include the tourist office (27.60.08), La Marine Service (27.70.34) and Yacht Charter Agency (27.62.38).
Deep-sea fishing expeditions are run by Pierrot Choisy on his Bertram, and he can be reached through the College Mireille Choisy in Gustavia (27.61.22). Charter boat possibilities are posted on bulletin boards near the quay in Gustavia or can be arranged through Yacht Charter Agency and La Marine Service.
Suba Diving: Guy Blateau is a licensed, accredited divemaster who operates from La Marine Service. His Diving Center has scuba gear and gives free initiation in hotel pools. There is also a branch at the Hotel Guanahani. Dive trips are priced at about $50 a person, gear included. Night dives are also offered.
Windsurfing is particularly good at the beaches of St. Jean, Grand Cul de Sac, Lorient and Flamands. At St. Jean, rentals and lessons are available at the St. Bart Wind School in front of the Tom Beach Hotel; at Grand Cul de Sac from Wind Wave Power at the St. Bart's Beach Hotel and from Atlantis next to the Gloriette restaurant. Rentals average about $14 an hour. A great spot for windsurfing pros is Washing Machine on the southeast coast between Toiny and Grand Fond. Waterskiing can be arranged with the Marine Service at about $42 an hour.
Few of the 14 beaches are crowded, even in peak season. All are public and free. Nude bathing is prohibited, but topless sunbathing is quite common. For beaches with hotels, restaurants and water sports, Grand Cul de Sac on the northeast shore fits the bill, as does St. Jean, which is actually two beaches divided by the Eden Rock promontory. There are also tiny hotels and restaurants at Flamands to the west, a stretch of white sand fringed with lantana palms.

Hotels
 Among resorts with good beaches are El Sereno, which has bungalows in walled gardens with double rooms starting at $245; Guanahani, where some of the 80 rooms and suites have private pools, from $375; and Manapany, consisting of hillside cottages overlooking the sea, $340. Less expensive and with the best water sports is St. Bart's Beach Hotel and its companion, Grand Cul de Sac. The Wind Wave Power water-sports center lies between the two. At the 36-room St. Bart's, rates are from $211, and at Grand Cul de Sac, from $132.

(800-344-4606)
 
Overview
 St. Eustatius has three beaches each quite different in character. Oranje Beach has interesting sand colors -- areas of light beige and black. Waves are lower on this leeward side: no strong current, undertow, sea urchins or dangerous fish. The two-mile-long Zeelandia, with black and tan sand, has Atlantic surf, fresh invigorating trade winds and a dangerous undertow. Swimming is not recommended, but it is good for wading with a partner, sunbathing and beach hiking. Lynch Beach, on the Atlantic side, is small with light brown sand. Stay near shore and watch out for undertow. There are no lifeguards at any of these beaches.
Some of the best dive sites on this island of nine square miles are Crook's Reef, Double Wreck, Jenkins Bay Reef, the Wall and Supermarket, where many wrecks lie on the ocean floor about 1,200 yards offshore. There is one dive shop, Dive Statia, in Lower Town Oranjestad (599-3-82435) with rates starting at $35 for a single dive; six dives or more cost $22.50 each.
Walkers come across abandoned forts, old sugar mills and ruins of plantation houses. They can also hike up the mountain to the Quill, the crater of an extinct volcano containing a rain forest.

1270 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10020
(212-582-4520)
 
Overview
 Much of St. John lies within a national park, and the park includes many of the island's most beautiful beaches. Trunk Bay is among the best. Snorkelers can swim a short distance from shore and explore a small cay. Snorkeling equipment may be rented at Trunk and Cinnamon Bay beaches. Trunk is a favorite for picnicking as are Honeymoon and Hawk's Nest beaches.
Tropical Isles Yacht Charters (809-776-6922) offers just about everything for the vacationing sailor and water sports enthusiast.

Instead of divers carrying an air tank, the tank floats on a raft while the diver is tethered below. Cost for a three-hour tour is $80 a couple or $50 a person.

Hotels
 St. John did not suffer severe damage from Hurricane Hugo and all hotels are operating. A 7.5 percent room tax is added to all rates on the island.
Caneel Bay (809-776-6111 or 800-223-7637), the beachside resort that incorporates ruins of a 17th-century plantation, includes seven beaches, some secluded as well as some that attract residents. Caneel's divemaster can arrange lessons and tours for those interested in scuba diving and snorkeling. Windsurfing is also available.

The sea can become cloudy near the hotel, so snorkelers are encouraged to visit Trunk Bay or other spots, and the resort provides an ice chest for those excursions. The water is fine for swimming, and the resort provides guests with windsurfers, paddleboats and kayaks. Toobies -- motorized innertubes -- are available at no charge. The divemaster can arrange day charters and fishing trips that leave from the hotel's dock.

ST. LUCIA
 
ST. LUCIA TOURIST BOARD
820 SECOND AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10017
(212-867-2950)
 
Overview
 St. Lucia's water sports activities are getting a boost this year as close to 130 yachts from all over the world end a 2,700-mile journey across the Atlantic by sailing into the island's Rodney Bay Marina. The winners of the event, the Atlantic Rally for Cruisers, are expected to cross the finish line this week. Most of the yachts are due to arrive by Dec. 23. The rally began last month at Las Palmas in the Canary Islands.
The day after completion of the Atlantic event, the St. Lucia Yachting Association holds its own Christmas yachting regatta, a series of three races along the island's west coast. Several yachts in the rally will also sail in the regatta.
Most of the hotels are virtually on the seashore and place great emphasis on water sports: windsurfing, water skiing, parasailing and others. Dive shops offer snorkeling and scuba diving, and deep-sea fishing can be arranged. Most hotels offer their guests complimentary masks, fins and snorkels. Scuba St. Lucia at the Anse Chastanet Hotel in the town of Soufriere, 26 miles from the capital, Castries, is one of the best bets for water sports, offering beach and boat dives as well as resort courses for beginners and certification courses. Single dives cost $25; packages are available at discounted rates. Here, too, equipment can be rented (mask, fins and snorkel costs $4 daily or $20 weekly), including cameras for underwater photography.
 
Hotels
 There are more than a dozen good hotels on St. Lucia, all of which have direct access to the beach. Anse Chastanet has views of the Pitons, the two conical mountains that rise more than 2,400 feet above sea level. Most of the hillside rooms are octagonal gazebos. Deluxe suites are either hillside or beachside and include outdoor living room and refrigerator. Rates, with two meals a day, range from $240 to $300 for two. Weekly packages with two meals a day start at $2,080 for two. Anse Chastanet offers a seven-night scuba package with room, two meals daily, 12 dives from boat or beach, other water sports and transfers from $1,240 a person.
At Cunard La Toc Hotel and Suites, most suites have their own private plunge pool. Room rates at the hotel range from $230 to $265 nightly and from $375 to $525 for one- and two-bedroom suites, some with private pools. La Toc is offering two additional free nights when five nights are booked -- in the rooms, not suites -- through April 20.
While Le Sport, an all-inclusive resort, concentrates on seawater treatments and aerobics at its spa, called Oasis, it also offers windsurfing and other water sports. Daily rates of $220 to $300 a person in double occupancy include sports facilities, the spa's activities, three meals a day (based on a light style of cooking) and refreshments and bar drinks. Guests who stay at least seven nights get a rebate of $349 on their air fare.

Almost every hotel on or close to the beach is involved with windsurfing, sailing and other water sports. There are many beaches. Some local snorkelers say Dawn Beach is best for exploring the reefs and marine life just offshore. Others generally favored are Maho, Little Bay, Oyster Pond and Mullet Bay.
A number of water-sports centers offer lessons, equipment rental and tours. Among them are Maho Watersports at Mullet Bay Resort, Watersports Unlimited at St. Maarten Beach Club and at Holland House Beach Hotel, Beach Bums on Simpson Bay, Red Ensign Watersports at the Dawn Beach Hotel, Little Bay Watersports at the Divi Little Bay Beach Hotel, Ocean Explorers on Simpson Bay and St. Maarten Divers and Watersports at the Great Bay Hotel.
Ocean Explorers (45252) charges $45 for a scuba diving lesson; a certification course lasting five days costs $318, and there are various other packages. Snorkeling trips lasting two and a half hours are $30. Maho (52801) offers a similar program. A three-hour resort course is $45, separate dives can be had for $45, and the one-week certification course costs $350.
Places for windsurfing include the Little Bay Beach Hotel, Mullet Bay Resort and the Dawn Beach Hotel, where the water-sports centers provide rentals and instruction. Jet skiing, water skiing, parasailing, sailing and deep-sea fgishing are available on St. Maarten and generally can be arranged through hotel activity desks.
 In Philipsburg, a new restaurant with a view of Great Bay Harbor is San Marco on Front Street (22166). Linguini salsa caraibi (lobster and shrimps in red or white sauce) is among the specialties, and there is an Italian wine list.

 The big Mullet Bay Resort, which has golf course, tennis courts and several restaurants, charges $225 for a twin room with kitchenette; rates rise to $890 for a suite sleeping six people. The hotel also includes a casino, nightclub and shopping arcade. Divi Little Bay Beach Resort has rates of $247 rising to $815 for suites.

(212-757-1125)
 
Overview
 By official count, St. Martin -- the French side of the island shared with Dutch St. Maarten -- has 36 white sand beaches, ranging from the small and secluded to broad expanses of untouched sand. Beaches are seldom crowded, even in peak season; public beaches are reached by tracks off the highway. There is a nudist beach at Orient Bay (and a hotel, the Club Orient Nudist Resort). Ilet Pinel, a tiny offshore island, is a favorite of beach recluses.
All diving -- reef, wreck, night, cave and drift -- is done from boats, since most sites are some distance offshore, and depth of dives is 30 to 60 feet. Off the northeast coast of the French side, dive sites include Ilet Pinel, for good shallow diving; Green Key, a barrier reef, and Flat Island (also known as Ile Tintamarre), for sheltered coves and sub-sea geological faults. The shallow reefs and coves offer some intresting snorkeling; equipment can be rented at hotels, and trips are available to a 15-foot coral reef. The area around Orient Bay, Green Key, Ilet Pinel and Flat Island are recommended.
Moorings favored by sailors include Baie Rouge; Nettle Bay near Marigot; Marigot Bay, for taking on stores from the Port la Royale Marina, and Grand Case Bay, a fishing village with dock, grocery, pharmacy, and an array of restautants. For charters, the Moorings, with 45 yachts, is based at Oyster Pond (Clearwater, Fla. 34624; 800-535-7289), as is Sun Yacht Charters, with 30 Centurions (Camden Me.; 800-772-3500). A.T.M. Yachts, the Newport Beach, Calif., charter company, has 20 yachts at Port Lonvilliers (800-227-5317).
Dynasty Yachts, based in Marigot, has a fleet of Dynamique Yachts, 47 to 80 feet, housed at the Royale Marina (590-87.85.21). Sample weekly rates for a 47-foot yacht sleeping eight, unskippered: $3,800 through April 29, then falling to $2,910. Other yacht charter companies include Caraibes Boat Sport, Star Voyage and Sun Ride Charter.
Good fishing boats ply the waters around St. Martin and can be chartered by the hour, half-day, full day, or week. Charters usually include tackle, bait, light lunch, and drinks. Dolphin, kingfish, sailfish, blue marlin, big eye and wahoo are the catches. Sailfish Caraibes, based at Port Lonvilliers (contact Capt. Jean-Pierre Goetz at 81.31.94), has two 33-foot Bertrams equipped with Fenwick rods, Penn International reels, and similar top deep-sea fishing material. Both half-day trips ($400 with open bar) and full-day trips ($700 with open bar and lunch) leave at 6 A.M. Maximum of 11 people a boat.
 
Hotels
 The outstanding beach resorts -- and with the best beaches -- are L'Habitation and La Samanna. L'Habitation has a 60-slip marina and offers water sports facilities, including canoes, snorkeling and water skiing. There are 250 rooms and suites and Le Privilege fitness center with six lighted tennis courts. Double rooms start at $300 and suites at $395 and rates include buffet breakfast. At La Samanna, which overlooks a long white sand beach, snorkeling gear, windsurfing, sailing and water skiing are complimentary. Rooms are from $400. A less expensive choice is the Grand Case Beach Club, within walking distance of the noted cluster of restaurants of Grand Case. Rates begin at $230 for two, with Continental breakfast.
 
Transportation
 From New York on B.W.I.A. (via Antigua), A.L.M., American, Continental and Pan Am; from Miami on Pan Am. Planes land at Queen Juliana Airport in the Dutch sector and visitors transfer to the French side by hotel car or taxi.

Overview
 While all of the United States Virgin Islands offer a wide selection of water sports, St. Thomas is the center for everything from sailing to lounging on the beach. For windsurfing, snorkeling and swimming, Sapphire Bay beach at the east end of the island is recommended.

Overview
 The Grenadines, part of the nation called St. Vincent and the Grenadines, are some 30 islands and cays stretching south from St. Vincent, home of the group's capital, Kingstown. Bequia, Mustique and Palm are among the larger ones. All the Grenadines have soft white coral sand beaches and clear water, ideal for sailing, diving and snorkeling. Dive sites around St. Vincent include the Garden, a spot with coral terraces conducive to underwater photography; New Guinea Reef, with its black coral, and the Forest, noted for gorgonian corals 6 to 10 feet tall waving in the current. Bequia has seven miles of fringing reefs, many of them virtually undived.
Instruction and equipment are available wherever the diving is good. On St. Vincent, for example, Mariners Watersports and Yacht Charters (809-45-84228) offers all water sports, day trips to Bequia and to the Falls of Baleine on St. Vincent's northwest coast. There are several other water sports outfits. Some hotels provide snorkeling equipment and some have sailboard equipment. On St. Vincent, swimming on the rocky windward coast is not advisable because of rough seas.
The sailing is renowned around the world, and yachts may be chartered from a number of outfits, including Mariners, Frangipani Yacht Services on Bequia and Anchorage Yacht Club on Union. A string of sources for windsurfing equipment and instruction stretches from the Windsurfing International School on St. Vincent to Sunsports on Bequia and Basil's Bar, Mustique. Basil's is also one of the places to rent water skis along with the Plantation House Hotel on Bequia.
 
Hotels
 Among less expensive lodgings on the islands is the 27-room Friendship Bay Resort on Bequia where oceanview rooms for two, with two meals a day, are $175 and oceanfront rooms, $225. In New York, Friendship Bay is represented by I.T.R. (212-545-8469 or 800-223-9815). One of the most exclusive hotels is the Young Island Resort, 200 yards off St. Vincent's south coast. Guests at its cottages and suites pay from $365 a day, with two meals. Two 44-foot yachts are available for guests' use. The resort is represented by Ralph Locke at 914-763-5526 or 800-223-1108), who also acts for the Cotton House.
The Cotton House is the only hotel on Mustique, and it's expensive, but you don't have top spend a great deal to stay on the island. Firefly House (809-45-84621), a private villa overlooking Britannia Bay, charges $80 for a double room with Continental breakfast. The Cotton House rate is about $500 a day for room and three meals.

370 LEXINGTON AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10017
(212-696-0400)
 
Overview
 Beaches range from popular hangouts with bars, restaurants and equipment rental to quiet stretches affording solitude. All beaches, including those bordering private property, can be used by the public from the ocean to the highwater mark. Among notable beaches is Cane Garden Bay on the northwest coast, offering swimming and snorkeling as well as bars and restaurants.
Smugglers Cove between Long Bay and West End is quiet, with excellent snorkeling and basic accommodations offered by the couple that run the restaurant there. Each of four guest rooms costs $98 for two (809-495-4234). Elizabeth Beach on the northeast coast is one of Tortola's best kept secrets -- no facilities, just miles of crashing waves, palms and white sands. Brewers Bay offers the island's only campground at the edge of nearly a mile of remote beach and some of the best snorkeling. The campground (809-494-3463) provides 20 two-person tents at $20 a night and tent sites for $7 nightly. Ruins of an old distillery are at the camp's edge.
 
Hotels
 Nestled between steep green hills and nearly a mile of beach, Long Bay Beach Resort has 20 hillside studios and 42 beachfront units with four-poster beds and patios.

Overview
 Calls by cruise ships to the two islands and flights to Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, from Europe, which were suspended because of the attempted coup July 27 and the resulting state of emergency, have resumed. Tourism, disrupted by the political crisis, has begun to recover. However, at this writing a curfew remains in effect between 1 and 5 A.M. on Trinidad; there is no curfew on Tobago.
Tobago, rather than the larger island of Trinidad, provides the majority of facilities for snorkeling, diving, water skiing, sailing and other water sports. Its trump card is the Buccoo Bay and Reef, where millions of coral creatures swim in submarine gardens, and coral sparkles in the clear water. The marine life can be viewed in glass-bottom boats. Fine beaches include Castara, Charlotteville, Lambeau, a tiny bathing spot near the chief town, Scarborough, and Pigeon Point.
For scuba divers Tobago has two major dive shops: Tobago Dive Experience, operated by Sean Robinson and Derek Chung, from the Blue Waters Inn at Speyside, and the Crown Point Beach Hotel (809-639-8781); and Tobago Marine Sports, which can be reached at the Crown Reef Hotel, Store Bay (809-639-0291). Dive Experience gives various courses, including one of five days for $285. Its teaching programs are done at the newly opened Grafton Beach Resort (809-639-0191) and Crown Point, while advanced work takes place at Speyside, noted for its manta rays that span some 30 feet.
Marine Sports is run by John Darwent, whose specialties are night diving, deep diving, search and recovery. His dive courses start at $65; five days of open-water instruction cost $180. Both operations also provide snorkeling trips and rent equipment.
Although only a short drive from Port-of-Spain, the capital, the trip to Maracas Bay, Trinidad's most popular bathing resort, offers visitors great views of mountains and tropical forest during a high, winding climb to the North Coast road before the descent to the bay. The tourist board has installed modern facilities for bathers and picnickers. Farther along the same coast road is Tyrico Bay, with surfing on high waves. On the east coast is Manzanilla Beach, which has a picnic area with snack bar, changing rooms and a paved parking area.
Preparations are under way in Trinidad for the Parang season leading up to Christmas when singers, guitarists and tambourine players gather to perform Christmas songs. After the holidays comes the calypso season when steel bands take part in competitions before the Carnival parade of bands taking place next Feb. 11 and 12, the Monday and Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday. Hotels and guest houses are often heavily booked during this period.
 
Hotels
 The hotels that offer good water sports facilities are on Tobago. One is the new Grafton Beach Resort (809-639-0191 and 809-639-9444), which has 108 air-conditoned rooms and charges $120 for a double room and $30 for a third person sharing. Another is the 29-room Blue Waters Inn, at Speyside (809-660-4341 and 809-660-4077), where rates for two are from $90 to $150; children under 12, $15. Sandy Point Beach Club at Sandy Point (809-639-8533) has 42 rooms with rates of $70 for a double room.
 
Transportation
 From New York and Miami on B.W.I.A., Pan Am and American. An air bridge service between Trinidad and Tobago is operated by B.W.I.A., with several daily flights from 6:15 A.M. to 7:15 P.M.
 
VIRGIN GORDA
 
BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS TOURIST BOARD
370 LEXINGTON AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10017
(212-696-0400)
 
Overview
 The nearly deserted white beaches are enough reason to visit the island, but along with them are good snorkeling, diving and sailing opportunities. Certainly the most popular site is the Baths, a curving beach interrupted by large round boulders that seem to have dropped from the sky by the handful. The clear, blue water washes around the rocks, the tops of which form a rough ceiling and shelter from the blazing sun. The waist-deep pools are safe for wading. Climbing over the smaller rocks leads to the open sea and snorkeling.
Nearby, Spring Bay offers shade, picnic tables and swimming. Both the Baths and Spring Bay are a short walk down narrow trails from a parking area. Novice snorkelers should try Savannah Bay, where they can see an expansive reef while wading through knee-deep water.
The island's annual festival around Easter is a weeklong celebration ending in a day of dancing, parades and music.

Hotels
 North Sound, along the eastern tip, is protected from surge and storm and is teeming with activity from anchored yachts and the Bitter End Yacht Club. The resort, named for being the last point of land before the open waters of the Atlantic, is one-of-a-kind in the area. Guests who stay in one of 50 cottages will have a tough time deciding between the water sports available. Windsurfing and sailing lessons are given at every level; fees range from $50 to $100. Sportfishing and scuba diving are available at extra cost. The Admiral's package (seven nights) includes unlimited use of several types of sailboats, windsurfers and Boston Whalers, daily island excursions, airport transfers, all meals, snorkel fins and free beginners' sailing course, and starts at $2,240 for two people; call 800-872-2392.
Although it's but a short distance from the Bitter End, Biras Creek feels as if it's miles from anyone. Its 100 acres are laced with trails to the beach, which offers guests use of several types of boats, windsurfers and snorkeling gear. There is a fee for water skiing, scuba diving, deep-sea fishing and excursion charters, but water sports lessons are free. There is a freshwater swimming pool and bicycles at each cottage. The 34 private cottages are surrounded by sea grapes and an occasional six-foot iguana. Daily rates for two, from $415. 800-223-1108.
North Sound is accessible only by boat. The taxi ride from Spanish Town to Gun Creek is well worth the time, and both hotels offer boat service from there to their shores. Or, the North Sound Express ferry travels from Trellis Bay, Beef Island (Tortola), to North Sound several times a day.
 
Transportation
 Flights daily from San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Tortola-Beef Island on Air B.V.I., American Eagle and Eastern Metro; from St. Thomas, U.S.V.I., on Air B.V.I and Eastern Metro. Daily ferryboat service from St. Thomas.

HEADLINE: WINTER IN THE SUN;
Growing Pains in the Caribbean

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH; HOWARD W. FRENCH is the Caribbean correspondent of The New York Times.

 BODY:
After years of seeking ever greater numbers of tourists, many Caribbean island nations are debating whether they are becoming victims of their own success.
From less-developed St. Lucia to tourism-dependent Barbados, the more-is-better approach to tourism is being questioned as it conflicts with fundamental issues such as protecting local environments and the islands' economic independence. 
 Some islands have long been or are rapidly becoming saturated with hotels, beach resorts and duty-free shopping centers, which they have relied upon to draw visitors from the United States. While this development succeeded in fueling years of growth, the resulting traffic jams, crowded beaches and jumbles of concrete buildings are now making it more difficult to attract American visitors interested in fitness vacations, wilderness and solitude.
"We still have a core product of sunshine and sea that people want and I think will continue to want," said Jean Holder, director of the Caribbean Tourism Organization, the regional industry's principal research and promotion group. "But many of the established countries are having to work much harder to maintain occupancy rates and the level of interest, and there is certainly a change in our market in relation to the whole 'green' movement."
On the Atlantic island of Bermuda, there has been strong opposition to the construction of a 400-room Ritz Carlton Hotel on the south shore. Opponents of the planned seven-story hotel have warned against breaking with the island's gentle low-rise construction style and building so densely as to create unmanageable traffic jams.
In Barbados, economic reliance on tourism, which brings a half-million visitors to the 166-square-mile island each year, has had other costs. Government engineers have estimated that the island's white sand beaches on its more developed west coast are washing away at the rate of a foot each year. The suspected culprit is untreated sewage, which kills the coral reefs that have long acted as a natural wave barrier.
Barbados, which derives about a third of its income from tourism, is now scrambling to build more sewage treatment plants to supplement the one it already has, and has borrowed $7.3 million from the Inter-American Development Bank to combat the erosion problem.

OTHER islands are beginning to show concern. The United States Virgin Islands, for example, which include some of the most heavily developed areas in the Caribbean, began a $3 million international publicity campaign last summer focusing on images of underwater life, flowering plants and migratory birds to emphasize its commitment to protecting the environment.
Indeed many travel publications have begun grouping islands according to density of development. Islands like New Providence (where Nassau is situated) in the Bahamas, St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands, the Dutch side of St. Martin, Barbados and Aruba -- all places that have invested heavily in tourism -- are now frequently described as mass-market destinations, best suited for package tour and cruise visitors, rather than discriminating individual tourists.
An economic model that ranks the islands' degree of tourism "penetration" and predicts its impact on their environments and economies has been devised by Jerome L. McElroy, chairman of the business and economics department at St. Mary's College in Notre Dame,Ind., whose academic specialty is Caribbean tourism and who taught in the Virgin Islands for 10 years. The model uses a variety of data, including population, land area, hotel capacity, visitor arrivals and spending per visitor.
Rather than building more hotels and straining to increase the number of visitors, Professor McElroy asserts that the best way for Caribbean countries to attain sustainable rates of growth and preserve their environments is to find new ways of encouraging guests to stay longer and consume more locally produced goods and services ranging from furniture and fruit to crafts and cultural activities.
"If you want a durable tourism that will remain profitable and won't overrun the island, you have to plan for a lower-density style that will get away from the major international enclave-style hotels," Professor McElroy said in an interview.
Islands that encouraged the growth of Club Med and other all-inclusive resorts, he said, have seen dramatic increases in visitor volume but relatively small gains in their local economies. Most of the earnings, he said, remain with the resort owner and the airline. And relatively few goods and services are supplied locally, he said.
"Each resort has self-contained economic activity with few links outside its own boundaries and little spillover," he said. "Everything from shopping to sailboating is provided at the site."
Moreover, he said, the volume of visitors may mean cumulative environmental damage to the fragile peninsulas and beaches where the big resorts are situated.
According to his studies, a number of islands, including the British Virgin Islands, Antigua, the Caymans, Turks and Caicos and Anguilla, have reached or are near the point where their governments must make major decisions about further growth if they wish to avoid becoming slump-prone and environmentally damaged.
One country where the Government is wrestling with such questions is St. Lucia. On this island, 28 miles long and up to 12 miles wide, forested volcanic peaks rise from the Caribbean to create striking vistas that invite comparison to Tahiti.
Only recently has St. Lucia begun to draw tourists in significant numbers. While the number of arrivals has doubled since 1980, with more than 130,000 last year, and quadrupled receipts from tourism, concern has spread, even among those involved in promoting the island, about the possibility that it could eventually become overrun.
"There is almost a schizophrenia between public discourse and public policy on tourism development," said one St. Lucian tourism official who asked not to be identified. "Everyone goes around saying that they stand firm on protecting the environment and the charm of the island, which they promise will stay green forever. Then they come back from a trip abroad with their eyes opened wide and say they want Singapore- or Hong Kong-style development. And I'm afraid that if we err, it will be on the side of overdevelopment."
With only about 2,000 hotel rooms and large expanses of virgin rain forest and pristine beaches, St. Lucia is still by most measures far from being overrun. But given the political imperative to produce jobs for a rapidly growing population, it is none too soon, advocates of gradual, controlled growth say, to begin planning limits.
Nicholas Thomas, director of the St. Lucia Tourist Board, said, "If we begin destroying the natural beauty here we are really going to be in a crunch because we don't have the experience of some of the other islands in managing things." He has advocated, among other limits, a moratorium on building more all-inclusive resorts until the issues are studied.
Jamaica, one of the region's most popular islands, has been able to avoid the stigma of beachfront saturation by virtue of its size and by its emphasis on attractions away from the beach, from its distinctive culture to its wooded and mountainous interior.
 And although its tourism industry has grown rapidly in the last decade, the Dominican Republic, another large country, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, has similarly avoided the image of saturation because of its size. To serve growing numbers of tourists and avoid congestion, the country has spread its construction over a variety of regions and established separate, modern airports to ease access.
Smaller Caribbean islands are the most vulnerable. Several of these, including Dominica, Montserrat, Saba, St. Eustatius and St. Vincent, remain for a variety of reasons relatively untouched by tourism. On some, island leaders have been ambivalent about opening doors to the tourist industry; on others, the infrequency of airline connections, or in the case of mountainous Dominica, the lack of white-sand beaches, have been inhibiting factors.
Nowadays, however, these less developed islands are being increasingly sought out, particularly by ecologically aware or active vacationers interested in hiking, sailing and other sports.
For this group of islands, Professor McElroy says, late arrival in the tourism game allows flexibility in planning, the opportunity to learn from the experience of the region around them, and time to decide exactly what sort of tourism they wish to encourage.
While no country seems ready to declare that it has reached a definitive limit with tourism, officials in some islands, like St. Lucia, St. Vincents, Grenada and Dominica, are planning to develop a collaborative marketing plan to advertise themselves as one destination. The aim is to avoid oversaturation and clutter.
Under this scheme, which is similar to one being used by the Bahamas, some Windward Islands will be marketed as resort centers with beach-based activities, while others will be promoted as quiet havens, for yachting and fishing or as centers for climbing and other land-based outdoor activities. Such plans reflect the growing realization that it is no longer desirable, economically or environmentally, to try to be all things to all tourists.

HEADLINE: Toll of Troubled Conversions Is Rising

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
A YEAR after the first reports of defaults by sponsors who converted rental buildings into cooperatives, the number of troubled buildings has risen sharply and thousands of middle-income New York City apartment owners are caught in a financial squeeze.
Having assessed the extent of the problem, public officials are questioning the viability of noneviction conversions in which only a minority of the apartments are bought, leaving the rest occupied by rent-regulated tenants who have lifetime tenures guaranteed by state law. 
 Once regarded as the savior of deteriorating rental housing, conversion now is considered the real estate analogue of Wall Street's junk bonds, with some sponsors' having piled debt on debt, which they now cannot sustain.
"Cooperative ownership is not fundamentally flawed, but the conversion process is," said Frederick J. Mehlman, who heads of the Attorney General's Real Estate Finance Bureau, where 28 lawyers have devoted nearly full time this year to sorting through the fallout.
 Most of those affected are people who bought apartments during the real estate boom of the 80's, when conversions spread from the most affluent sections of Manhattan to middle-income neighborhoods across the city, from Brighton Beach in Brooklyn to Kingsbridge in the Bronx.
Since 1981, enough rental buildings have been converted to house almost a million of New York City's 7 million residents.
Only a small minority of these buildings are under financial strain. Indeed, most of the converted buildings, particularly those where more than half the apartments were sold to tenants or to outside buyers, face little or no risk. Nor are financial problems expected in either the long-established or the newly built co-ops, where there are no rental tenants.
But the problems are spreading. Defaults by sponsors were virtually unknown before 1989, and began to emerge last December, when Time Equities, a major converter, reported to New York State that it was behind in mortgage payments, taxes or maintenance charges at 88 co-ops.
Since then, disclosure statements to the Attorney General show that the sponsors of at least 300 buildings -- nearly 10 percent of the number converted during the 80's -- have fallen behind on their obligations to the co-ops and condominiums. Some arrears have been paid, but many remain past due.
The problems have arisen in buildings where sponsors still own large numbers of rent-regulated apartments whose tenants elected not to buy when the buildings were converted. Most of these tenants pay rents that fall far short of the monthly maintenance charges required to cover their apartments' shares of the operating costs of the co-op. These costs typically include payments on the building's underlying mortgage as well as taxes, insurance, utilities and staff wages.
Unable to make up the monthly shortfalls, the sponsors have been defaulting and their obligations have been falling on the tenant-shareholders who own a minority of the apartments in their buildings. Although a few of Manhattan's most fashionable upper-income buildings are caught in such binds, state records show that most of the troubled buildings are in middle-income neighborhoods.
In some of the buildings, lenders have foreclosed on the sponsors' unsold, rent-regulated apartments and are trying to sell them at distressed prices that could undercut the value of the other units. At other buildings, the apartment owners are threatening to foreclose to take over the sponsors' apartments and collect the rents themselves.
Most banks and thrift institutions, fearing problems in the future, are refusing to extend individual mortgage loans in co-ops where a majority of the apartments are occupied by rent regulated tenants, even if the co-ops show no immediate signs of financial strain. That is making it harder for apartment owners to sell in an otherwise weak real estate market.
As a worst case, lawyers say lenders could foreclose on entire co-ops where mortgage payments are in arrears, a devastating move that would take the apartment owners' homes away while leaving them deeply in debt. No co-op building has been taken over in a bank foreclosure since the Great Depression of the 30's.
In a related problem that could threaten rent-regulated tenants, Federal officials presiding over the savings-and-loan bailout have said they may try to evict the renters from apartments that have been taken over from insolvent lenders. Attorney General Robert Abrams, who has promised to fight the evictions in court, said 515 rental apartments in 10 buildings are now at risk and the number is certain to grow.
"This has turned into a disaster," said Claire Shulman, the Borough President of Queens, where 77,000 apartments were converted from rentals to co-ops and condominiums during the 80's. Ms. Shulman, like many other officials, said she had welcomed those conversions, thinking that they would stabilize neighborhoods and bring much-needed investment in building improvements. Now, she said, 14,000 Queens apartment owners are threatened because their sponsors are in default.
"We are small people, and we don't deserve this," said Barbara Rooney, a part-time data processer who, with her husband, Patrick, a fuel-truck coordinator at La Guardia Airport, was among 247 middle-income renters who bought their apartments in Hyde Park Gardens, a complex in Kew Gardens Hills that went co-op in 1986.
The Rooneys' problems are typical of those in troubled co-ops. Five hundred rent-regulated tenants in the complex, which has 747 garden apartments, elected not to buy. Most pay rents below the $500 to $700 a month that is assessed in maintenance on each apartment by the co-op, and some pay less than $300 a month.
ALTHOUGH the shortfall should be covered by the sponsor of the conversion, Herman I. Krauss, he stopped paying maintenance, taxes and mortgage payments more than six months ago and his banks have foreclosed on his unsold rental apartments.
The wave of co-op and condominium conversions during the 80's was unmatched in New York City history. State records show that conversion plans for 3,762 rental buildings with 311,819 apartments were accepted by between January 1981 and last July.
Most were conversions to co-ops, in which buyers became corporate shareholders in their buildings and shared the financial liabilities of their sponsors. A co-op sponsor's debts almost always include an underlying mortgage on the building, which his fellow shareholders help pay off as part of their monthly assessments for maintenance; they also usually include additional layers of bank financing.
Those who bought apartments that were converted to condominiums are less vulnerable because they own title to their apartments instead of corporate shares, but they are not immune to problems. Although there is no underlying mortgage to carry in a condominium building, sponsors may default on common charges on their units for the building's labor, utility and insurance costs. If that happens, the other apartment owners must cover the costs.
Typically, a sponsor in the mid-80's took a loan to buy a rental building for conversion, then used the unsold rental apartments in the building as collateral for other loans. Often, he also offered "wraparound financing" to buyers in the co-op, meaning that he became a lender himself, extending mortgage loans to fellow shareholders.
Some real estate experts say the problems at co-ops resemble those of Wall Street and its corporate clients, who entered the 1990's under too much debt. Some refer to recent co-op conversions as the junk bonds of New York City real estate. Others, though, maintain that the conversions benefited New York, protecting it somewhat from the flight of middle-income professionals during economic downturns.
"The city's dependence on rental housing has always been its fault line," said Emanuel Tobier, a professor of economics and urban planning at New York University. "To whatever extent the conversions of the 80's reduced the mobility of the middle-class, it has stabilized New York."
Nor is the outlook for all the troubled conversions entirely bleak. Some lenders, who have foreclosed on recalcitrant sponsors, are offering to transfer ownership of unsold apartments to their rental tenants at rock-bottom prices.
"THE obvious goal is to sell these apartments, and it is the tenants that have the greatest opportunity to benefit," said James Kerr, a spokesman for the Crossland Savings Bank, New York City's largest thrift, which has foreclosed on the unsold rental apartments in more than a dozen buildings. The apartments were used as collateral for $25 million in financing by Time Equities.
Crossland, with little desire to become a landlord, said it would offer its rent-regulated tenants in Time Equities buildings the opportunity to buy their apartments at low prices, but it declined to say how low.
The terms have been spelled out more clearly at Hyde Park Gardens, where the sponsor's apartments have been taken in foreclosure by a consortium of New York lenders, including the Bowery Savings Bank and EAB. In a preliminary offer, which must be approved by the Attorney General, the banks said their rent-regulated tenants could buy their apartments for $4,000 a room, or under $20,000 for a two-bedroom apartment.
Still, because many of the tenants' monthly rents are now below what they would be paying if they bought their apartments, there is no assurance the bail-out plan will work.
Many critics of the current conversion process have been lobbying legislators in Albany for changes. Most important, they say, is to amend the current law that allows sponsors to convert their buildings after selling only 15 percent of the shares or apartments in them.
For more than three years, Mr. Abrams and his staff have been seeking a new law to require that at least 25 percent of the apartments be sold in a conversion. The measure has been passed repeatedly in the Assembly but has so far failed in the Senate. It is to be introduced in each house again early next year.
"A lot of the problems we have seen in recent conversions are being worked out, but there may come a point where not all of them can be," said Mr. Melhlman of the Attorney General's office.
Lawyers say that foreclosing on the underlying mortgage of a co-op would be devastating to its shareholders. Since buyers in a co-op own shares a corporation -- giving them a different legal status from most homeowners -- their shares would be taken away and their apartments would revert to rental units. Although they could stay on as rental tenants, they would also retain responsibility for paying off their individual mortgage loans.
Some real estate lawywers say that such foreclosures, although possible, are at most a remote threat.
"I'm willing to bet it just won't happen," said Stuart Saft of Manhattan, an attorney for several troubled co-ops. He added that one defense available to the co-op shareholders is to seek protection for their buildings under Federal bankruptcy laws, a recourse that would mean added delay and legal expenses in trying to recover money owed by recalcitrant sponsors, but that would prevent lenders from seizing their homes. However, the ongoing operating costs of the building would still have to be carried by the shareholders.
Other complex legal questions have emerged. One is the role of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency charged with disposing of the assets of failed thrift institutions, including several that have financed New York City co-ops and condominiums. The agency, which has been ordered by Congress to seek the highest prices it can for its assets, threatened in September to evict nine rent-regulated tenants who had declined to buy their apartments in an expensive condominium on East 57th Street in Manhattan.
Resolution Trust, which had seized the apartments from insolvent lenders, reasoned that the apartments would be more valuable if they were vacant and that it could invoke Federal authority to bypass state rules. After protests from many New York officials, the agency withdrew its eviction threat temporarily in October and said it would conduct a review of how to handle rent regulated apartments. Two Representatives -- Eliot L. Engel of the Bronx and Yonkers and James H. Scheuer of Queens, the Bronx and Nassau County, both Democrats-- said they will introduce a bill in January that would require Resolution Trust to abide by any state or local law protecting renters from eviction.
LAST week, the Federal agency said through a spokesman in Washington that it was still studying the legal ramifications and might try to evict some New York City renters.
The consequences loom large. Mr. Mehlman said he knew of 515 rent- regulated apartments in 10 co-op and condominium buildings that have already fallen into Federal conservatorship this year because of the failures of the Nassau Federal Savings Bank in Brooklyn, the Ensign Savings Bank of Manhattan and other lenders. The list would grow if other thrifts fail in New York's troubled banking environment.
Real estate experts say the conversion wave of the 80's can be traced to the rent-control laws adopted during World War II and the rent-stabilization laws extended to postwar apartment buildings in 1974. Landlords, limited in how much they could raise rents, struck upon conversion as a way of turning a low-performance investment into a rich source of profits.
In many cases, the conversions also benefited tenants, who were able to buy their apartments at below-market prices and then sell them at a profit.
During the 50's and 60's and most of the 70's, conversions were governed by "eviction plan" rules imposed by the city and New York State. Landlords could convert their rentals to co-ops and evict tenants who did not buy, but they needed to first sell at least 35 percent of their units.
But the rules began to change in 1982 with the advent of state laws allowing "noneviction" conversions. Under this approach, sponsors were compelled to honor the rights of rent-regulated tenants but could convert their buildings by selling only 15 percent of the apartments or co-op shares. Federal tax laws made the conversion business more attractive because of generous real estate deductions, which enticed many investors to buy the occupied rental apartments from converters as long-term tax shelters.
Thus, the experts said, the stage was set in 1982 for the wave of conversions that lasted through the decade, even after changes in the Federal tax code in 1986 pushed most investors out of the market and left sponsors holding thousands of rent-regulated apartments.

Rent-Control Increases
 
Question: I am a rent-controlled tenant in a building that also has rent-stabilized tenants. I am now paying 7.5 percent increases and fuel pass-along costs while rent-stabilized tenants are paying only 9 percent increases on two-year leases. Some tenants in rent-controlled apartments pay more rent than tenants in rent-stabilized apartments, some of which have new sinks, refrigerators and gas ranges. Can anything be done to equalize the rents in our building? . . . Alfred Soled, Long Island City, Queens
 
Answer: No. Even though both forms of rent regulation are administered by the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, their rent increases are based on different criteria.
In New York City, a maximum base rent is established for each rent-controlled apartment and owners who show they are providing essential services can raise rents by 7.5 percent each year until the maximum is reached. In the last few years the 7.5 percent increase has been higher than increases set for rent-stabilized apartments by the Rent Guidelines Board.
As part of a plan to put all rent-regulated housing under the same system, rent control is being phased out, with vacated apartments going to rent stabilization.
 
New Windows
 
Question: The management of our Mitchell-Lama complex recently started replacing the windows with ones of a different size. The problem for some tenants is that the old shades, blinds and air-conditioners do not fit. Is the landlord responsible for reimbursing us for the expense of having these things replaced or reinstalled? . . . Diane Christiansen, Manhattan
 
Answer: No. There are no rules in Mitchell-Lama housing that require landlords to reimburse tenants for blinds, shades or fixtures if these no longer fit after new windows have been installed. In Mitchell-Lama units under the jurisdiction of the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, if the reinstallation of fixtures or air-conditioners involves no extra expense or effort, the landlord is responsible. Otherwise, the tenant must do it.
Roz Post, a spokesman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said tenants in city-sponsored Mitchell Lama projects are responsible for replacing their own air-conditioners and other fixtures after window work has been done.
 
Security Deposits
 
Question: I am trying to recover the security deposit my sister made when she rented her apartment. She vacated when it became necessary for her to live in a nursing home. I understand that under such circumstances tenants can break leases without penalty. But what about the security deposit? Is there a law or rule that says it must be returned? . . . Raymond Laughlin, Manhasset, L.I.
 
Answer: No. Samuel Himmelstein, a lawyer who specializes in real estate matters, said there are no statutes that would automatically require a landlord to return a security deposit under the circumstances you have described. Mr. Himmelstein said that a tenant would probably be entitled to a return of the security only if a landlord caused a breach of the lease by failing to maintain an apartment in good condition.
Mr. Himmelstein said that making a strong case for the return of your sister's security deposit would depend on the wording of the lease. The security deposit clause in many leases, he said, states that the landlord has the right to retain the security if the tenant vacates before the end of the lease.

HEADLINE: Stamford Scrambling To Resurrect Office Boom

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
FOR most of the past two decades, Stamford has been a magnet to New York City corporations weary of rising rents and crime rates. Stamford was so desirable that it never created an economic-development office to help lure Fortune 500 companies, like the Olin Corporation, Xerox and GTE, that found their way there.
In the past year, though, Stamford's office boom has been brought up short by overbuilding, the slumping Northeast economy and the city's own high housing costs and growing congestion. To compete for what prospects remain -- like Jersey City and areas of neighboring Westchester County -- the city has begun aggressively courting corporate headquarters and financial services companies now in Manhattan. The campaign's centerpiece, a 16-page advertising supplement that was published in The Wall Street Journal last month, extols Stamford's virtues: economic stability, declining cost of housing and office space, proximity to Manhattan and the lack of a state or municipal income tax, which can mean an automatic raise of up to 12 percent for some employees leaving New York City. "Stamford is late in getting into the game, and has rested on its laurels for a long time," said David E. Anderson, president of the Stamford Partnership, a nonprofit alliance of business, government and community leaders involved in civic action and research. "Two years ago, no one would have dreamt of putting an 16-page insert in The Wall Street Journal." 
 More important, perhaps, is Mayor Thom Serrani's new role as a de facto director of economic development, holding strategy sessions, seminars and pep talks with commercial brokers battered by the city's chronically high office-space vacancy rates.
He has also stepped up his personal contacts with officials from companies considering moves to his city, like Morgan Stanley Group, a securities concern with 4,200 employees. "Until recently," Mr. Serrani said, "Stamford didn't have to sell itself. It was a natural. But because of the economy and the vacancy issues, I feel it's more incumbent upon me to change my role as Mayor.
"My job is to be the city's No. 1 salesman. And that's something I'm spending a lot of time doing."
Local real-estate brokers said that as a prelude to a possible move, Morgan Stanley will soon take an option to buy or lease an 11-acre site north of the Metro-North Commuter Railroad station in downtown Stamford.
Morgan Stanley officials, who have been exploring a move out of Manhattan for months and have looked at several locations in Connecticut, have denied that they have made a decision to move. The company's lease at 1251 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan expires in 1998.
Neither Mr. Serrani nor a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, Jeanne D. Andrews, would comment on a story published recently in The Advocate of Stamford that cited anonymous sources who said the company would shortly announce plans to relocate to Stamford.
"A lot of people feel they are very close to an announcement," said Joseph A. Ercolano, vice president of economic development for the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association, a private business-advocacy organization based in Stamford.
If Morgan Stanley does move to Stamford, city officials said, they hope that would spark other corporate relocations. They noted that Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, a brokerage house that employs almost 3,500 people in Manhattan, is reportedly considering a move to property in Greenwich owned by its parent company, Primerica.
Such a migration into Connecticut would be a smaller version of the wave that helped rebuild Stamford in the 1970's and early 1980's from a decrepit manufacturing town into a center for the reinsurance industry, accounting firms and corporate financial services.
That period virtually ended by the mid-1980's, when both residential and commercial real-estate costs rose so high that companies balked at moving to the area. Mergers and acquisitions also forced businesses, like the Singer Company, to leave Stamford.
Office-space vacancy rates in Stamford have been hovering around 25 percent. The glut has been especially troubling for the F. D. Rich Company, which built many of the high-rise towers that have become synonymous with the city's reputation as a new corporate capital. The company, pinched for cash, has been attempting to reorganize.
 
Problems Become Selling Points
 Stamford also has had to fend off efforts by other cities, including some of its Fairfield County neighbors, like Norwalk, to steal away the corporations that arrived 10 and 20 years ago. Although company officials have denied any move is in the works, people familiar with Stamford's real-estate market said a rumor had long been circulating that GTE would move its corporate headquarters to Texas.
The city's problems, however, have turned into selling points, as commercial rentals have fallen to about $25 a square foot from the high of $30 to $40 a square foot.
While still high, Stamford's residential real-estate prices have remained flat over the past 18 months. Many sellers, though, are offering lease options and other creative deals that make owning a home in the area easier. The average price of a single-family house in Stamford is about $295,000.
"The tremendous disparity between Fairfield County and other places doesn't exist anymore," said Richard E. Schwartz, vice president at Prudential Relocation Management in White Plains. "People who just a year or two ago never thought they could afford a house in lower Fairfield County now are finding out that they can."
So far, Stamford's campaign to snare large corporations disenchanted with New York has not yielded any tangible benefits, although Mr. Serrani said he soon expects to make "a major announcement involving more than one company."
No concern on Fortune magazine's list of the nation's 500 largest companieshas moved its headquarters from New York to Stamford since General Signal did so in 1976, although several corporations, like American Brands in 1986, have moved just across the border in Greenwich. Other large companies that have moved to Stamford, like Cadbury Schweppes in 1989, appear on the magazine's roster of the top 500 service companies or have dropped off the Fortune 500 list since their move.
Most city officials and real-estate brokers in the area agreed that Stamford's future lies with attracting smaller companies, like International Masters Publishing, a 150-employee direct-mail company that moved to the city from Los Angeles last year.
"If Morgan is the first to announce, others will follow," Mr. Ercolano said. "But someone has to make a first move."

HEADLINE: Towns Facing Service Cuts Under New Law

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
AS local officials begin their annual struggle to balance rising municipal budgets, many say that a revised municipal spending law signed by Gov. Jim Florio last August will result in a substantial reduction in local services.
The law, commonly called the "municipal cap law" because it sets an annual 4.5 percent limit on increases in municipal budgets, was revised to eliminate exemptions from the cap that had been allowed under the prior law. Local officials say the revisions make an already bad law even worse. Limiting increases in municipal budgets, the officials say, contributes only marginally, if at all, to lowering property taxes. 
 Municipal services, they say, account for only a small portion of the total tax dollar paid by residents. Public education and county taxes, which are not limited by the law, account for as much as 75 percent of local tax bills, they say.
In addition, local officials say, eliminating exemptions for rapidly increasing solid-waste disposal and employee health benefit costs will result in cutbacks in other areas and may necessitate employee layoffs.
 State legislators, however, say the limitations are necessary to contain increases in local property taxes and to force local officials to eliminate unnecessary expenses. The elimination of exemptions to the law, they say, was necessary because as much as 50 percent of some municipal budgets had been exempted under the old law.
The budget cap issue arises as state and local officials, faced with an electorate angered by increases in state taxes and the threat of a statewide recession, attempt to achieve a balance between the rising cost of government and antitax sentiment.
"I think the whole cap law is basically a sham," said Robert A. Roth, chief financial officer of Middletown Township, a Monmouth County municipality with 70,000 residents.
"The law is designed to benefit state politicians at the expense of local government," Mr. Roth said. "It gives the impression that the legislators are doing something about taxes when in reality they're not."
Mr. Roth, like many municipal financial officers across the state, said the law failed to address the problem that it was intended to solve -- a steady rise in property taxes.
Inasmuch as the law limits increases in spending for most ordinary municipal services, he said, it only serves to hamstring officials who are faced with spiraling expenses over which they have no control. At the same time, Mr. Roth said, insofar as the law fails to place effective limits on public education expenses and county taxes, which together often account for as much as 75 percent of a municipality's total tax bill, the law does little to prevent municipal property taxes from increasing.
As a result, he said, the law effectively shifts the blame for rising taxes from state legislators and local school board officials to municipal government.
"Let's face it," Mr. Roth said. "The municipality sends out the tax bills, and it's the local tax collector sitting in a municipal office who ends up taking the wrath of the public."
 Mayor Patrick W. Parkinson of Middletown said, for example, that the Middletown Board of Education recently awarded teachers an 8.5 percent raise and clerks a 9.5 percent raise for each of the next three years.
The Board of Education's $70 million annual budget, which is double the municipal budget of $35 million, is not limited by the municipal cap laws, he said.
But with salaries and benefits accounting for 80 percent of the school budget, and with the school budget accounting for almost 60 percent of the total municipal tax bill, Board of Education salaries and benefits account for 48 percent of Middletown's property taxes, Mr. Parkinson said.
At the same time, Mr. Parkinson said, Middletown is now in salary negotiations with other municipal employees, including the police unions.
"When they see the teachers getting 8 and 9 percent, then they want it too," he said. But with a 4.5 percent limit on non-education municipal expenditures, Mr. Parkinson said, it is impossible to give employees a raise in excess of the limit without cutting services somewhere else.
"If the state wants us to adhere to the 4.5 percent, then fine," Mr. Parkinson said. "But keep the playing field level. As it is, we feel that the taxpayers are being taken to the cleaners on this."
The municipal cap law was first enacted in 1976 and provided for a 5 percent limit on almost all non-education municipal expenditures. Over the years, however, certain expenditures were exempted.
Solid-waste disposal costs, liability and health insurance costs and the purchase of police vehicles, for example, were exempted. In all, the original law was amended 46 times. But as a result, by 1990, exempted expenses in some municipalities accounted for almost half the budgets of those municipalities.
 
Exemptions Taken Back
 In August, Gov. Jim Florio signed a revised law that brought all the exemptions back under the spending limitation and reduced the statutory ceiling to 4.5 percent, with a provision allowing the municipalities to apply for an increase to 5 percent. Limits on public education expenses are not included in the law, but are governed by a complex formula contained in the Quality Education Act of 1990.
"This is the only way we can get a true picture of what the municipalities are required to spend," said State Senator Richard Van Wagner, Democrat of Middletown and sponsor of the revised legislation.
"The original cap law was useless," Mr. Van Wagner said. "The Legislature kept excluding things, and when you exclude things, you are in effect mandating property tax increases. We essentially went back to ground zero."
But that, municipal officials say, is just the problem.
After managing their municipalities for years with certain expenses outside the cap, they say, it is impossible for them to now absorb increasing costs for those expenses within the 4.5 percent limitation.
 
'Just Not Going to Work'
 "This is just not going to work," said James Pascale, township administrator of Princeton. "Tipping fees for solid-waste removal have increased several hundredfold in the last several years. And health insurance is not going up 5 percent; it's going up a whole lot more than that."
Both those expenses, he said, which had previously been exempted from caps, must now be included within the spending limit, thereby reducing available capital for other programs or services. "Something has got to give," Mr. Pascale said.
Another anomaly associated with the law, he said, is the fact that municipalities fortunate enough to have a budget surplus are prohibited from spending it without placing a referendum on the ballot requesting authorization.
"A community can have literally millions of dollars in surplus," Mr. Pascale said, "but because of the arbitrariness of the cap law, they can't spend the money, even if they have a high demand for certain municipal services."
But the most troubling aspect for local officials is that by enacting such a restrictive law, the Legislature has essentially pre-empted municipalities from establishing their own spending restraints.
 
'Arrogant and Presumptuous'
 "My opinion is that it's arrogant and presumptuous of the Legislature to think that local officials have no self-control," Mr. Pascale said, adding that "the fact of the matter is they're taxpayers in the community, so they're not going to spend a thin dime more than they have to."
The problems associated with the new law are not limited to sprawling suburban communities like Middletown or those fortunate enough to have surplus funds.
"In the past, the city never had a problem because of the exemptions," said Arthur Bunting Jr., Atlantic City's director of finance and revenue. "But insurance costs and solid-waste disposal costs have doubled and tripled and quadrupled."
What that means, Mr. Bunting said, is that "it's impossible to stay within the caps without reducing staff."
Experts on municipal government agree that many municipalities may have a difficult time operating within the new spending guidelines.
"They've got good reason to be concerned," said John Moran, a legislative analyst for the New Jersey League of Municipalities. "This is the tightest cap law that municipal governments have had to operate under since 1976."
Mr. Moran said, however, that some expenditures still remained outside the cap and could be increased as necessary. They include capital expenditures, amounts required to finance the previous year's deficits, public library support and affordable housing costs.
 
'Escape Clause' Provided
 In addition, experts say, there is an "escape" clause contained in the legislation that allows the state's Local Finance Board in the Department of Community Affairs to make exceptions to the law.
"They can get out from under the caps if they prove a case," said Dr. Ernest Reock, director of the Bureau of Government Research for Rutgers University in New Brunswick.
The law provides, however, that any exception made by the state's Local Finance Board must then be granted to all the state's 567 municipalities, a provision that would constrain the board from making decisions based upon strictly parochial needs.
But even with that provision, Dr. Reock said, he is opposed to the idea of legislative restraints on municipal budgets. "It does hold down expenditures," he said, "but I think that it's a terrible way to do it."
Dr. Reock said legislation establishing strict spending limitations took part of the responsibility for governing a municipality away from local officials. "What this really means is that you don't trust the political process to work within the community," he said.
And that, Dr. Reock said, weakens the concept of home rule in that it diminishes the right of the municipality to tax and spend as it sees fit.
 
Flying 'Flag' of Home Rule
 But Mr. Van Wagner, sponsor of the revised law, disagreed.
"There's no such thing as home rule," he said. "Home rule is a flag that flies when the municipalities want to do what they want to do."
Local officials, he said, would be wise to consider consolidating services and finding other ways to trim expenses. "There's a revolution going on in this state," he said, "and part of the anger is a great frustration with the growth of property taxes."
Municipal officials, however, appear to be well aware of that frustration.
At a recent League of Municipalities convention in Atlantic City, organizers scheduled a seminar on the expected impact of the caps.
As members entered the Grand Ballroom at Convention Hall, which had been curtained in half, it soon became apparent that more space would be needed. The curtains were drawn, and more than 1,000 members filled the hall -- the largest crowd that had assembled in the three days of meetings.

Faculty Broadens University Policy On Harassment

DATELINE: NEWARK, Del.

 BODY:
In the wake of a series of racial and anti-homosexual incidents on campus, the Faculty Senate of the University of Delaware ratified a proposal last week that strengthened the university's policy on sexual, racial and other forms of harassment.
In October, racial and anti-homosexual slurs were written on residence-hall doors, and a black student found her black doll hanging by its neck in her room. 
 In response to the incidents, the Black Students Union and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Student Union joined other university groups in a rally to voice their concerns and vowed not to tolerate such acts.
The university's president, David P. Roselle, told the protesters: "We need to be vigilant. We need to be more aware. We need to have better policies."
 
 Additions to List
 Acts prohibited under the old policy included intimidation by threats of violence and personal vilification of students on the basis of their race, sex, sexual orientation, age, religion or disability.
The new policy adds to the list vilification on the basis of national or ethnic origin, veteran's status, creed or color and defines more explicitly what constitutes harassment.
"Basically, we improved the definition of harassment by clarifying it," said Daniel D. Shade, an assistant professor in the Department of Individual and Family Studies and chairman of the faculty's committee on student life. Referring to the characters in the original "Star Trek" television series, Professor Shade said, "McCoy's calling Spock an ugly, pointy-eared Vulcan is an example of personal vilification."
Earlier this semester, Leslie Goldstein, a professor of political science and the Faculty Senate's president, charged the committee on student life with reviewing and clarifying the student handbook's policy statement on harassment. Professor Shade said the recent incidents of harassment on campus based on race and sexual orientation had increased the need for a policy change.
 
Possible Penalties
 Timothy F. Brooks, the dean of students, said there was a concern that the old policy would not pass a legal review, since it "was vague and flawed and could be misinterpreted."
Dean Brooks said harassment violations, heard by administrative hearing officers on a case-by-case basis, could result in probation, suspension or expulsion.
The president of the Delaware Undergraduate Student Congress, Michael E. DiFebbo Jr., said the old policy was ineffective because there was no clear definition of harassment. "It basically said harassment is harassing people," said Mr. DiFebbo, a senior business major from King of Prussia, Pa.
Farley Grubb, an associate professor of economics and a faculty senator who voted against the policy, said, "The new statement is in too much detail and loses control of how harassment is defined."
Professor Grubb added that the new policy would not have any effect on students. "It was an extreme attempt to codify a policy that was not codifiable," he said.

HEADLINE: A Heritage of Giving: Remember the Neediest Cases Fund;
Proud but Suddenly Poor, Elderly Reach Out for Help

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
Two months after Esther S., a former accountant and grade-school teacher, came to New York City from the Soviet Union last year, she found herself homeless and contemplating suicide. Lilian F., who lived a privileged life on the Upper East Side for many years, found herself penniless and almost homeless after the death of her husband.
Like countless other elderly men and women who face economic setbacks, failing health and family problems each year, Esther and Lilian reluctantly set aside their pride and turned to charities for assistance. 
 It was an emotionally wrenching step.
"I always used to have my own piece of bread," Esther said through an interpreter. "Here I am at 69, in a strange country with a strange language, where everything is different, abandoned by my daughter, and I still don't know why."
Lilian, describing how she felt about having to ask for help, said: "It was horrendous. It was like I wanted to jump out of the window."
In New York City today, an increasing number of elderly residents find themselves ineligible for government assistance but "still too poor to make it on their own," said Prema Mathai-Davis, the city's Commissioner for the Aging. For many of them, she added, the only option is a private social-service agency.
 
Arguments About Money
 When Esther arrived in this country from her native town in the western Ukraine, she moved in with her daughter and grandchildren in a two-bedroom apartment in Forest Hills.
"Everything was perfect for the first two months," Esther recalled.
She helped with the cleaning and other household chores, tutored her 13-year-old granddaughter in mathematics, and made embroidered items that she sold to supplement the family's income. But there were arguments, mostly about money.
Earlier this year she fell ill with digestive problems and was hospitalized for 10 days.
When she returned to her daughter's apartment, she said, the atmosphere was different. There were arguments that she said were initiated by her daughter's boyfriend over such questions as whether she ate too much of the family's food.
Finally, she said, her daughter kicked her out.
 
A Place to Live
 "It was a cold, rainy day, the end of March," Esther recalled. "For a moment there in the street I got the idea it would be good to be hit by a car."
But a 90-year-old Russian woman passing by convinced Esther to move in with her for a few days. Then Esther got a temporary job as a live-in babysitter on Long Island.
As that job was about to end last May, Esther contacted the Metropolitan New York Coordination Council on Jewish Poverty. The council, which maintains an emergency housing fund with Neediest Cases Fund contributions it receives from the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, got Esther a room in a private shelter and is paying her rent.
"Esther could have gone to a city shelter, but I don't think she would have survived," said Peter Fine, director of special projects for the council.
 
Doing Things for Friends
 At Respite House, on Manhattan's Lower East Side, Esther is one of 14 residents, who are assisted by two full-time social workers.
A petite woman with white hair, dark, questioning eyes, and a strong, husky voice, Esther is the kind of person who needs to be doing things for others. These days she spends most of her time in her room doing needlework, embroidery or alterations for her new friends in the shelter.
At other times, Esther, who knows almost no English, can be found sitting in the smoking corner of the shelter's lounge, conversing in Yiddish with several other residents or in Romanian with a couple who live in the building.
 
Losing Everything
 Further uptown, Lilian lives near Beekman Place, surrounded by the bric-a-brac of better days: Thai prints, Italian Renaissance pottery, an onyx table and crystal figurines.
A native New Yorker, Lilian has youthful skin and a youthful figure that belie her 74 years.
She was married to the senior partner in a Wall Street brokerage and had everything: a 6 1/2-room apartment in a building on East 57th Street, two Cadillacs and yearly trips around the world.
Then, in 1973, her husband died and the bottom fell out of her world. Soon after his death, the firm went out of business.
Lilian lost her apartment and rented a one-bedroom apartment near Beekman Place for herself and her son, who is developmentally disabled.
"I sold the stocks, the antiques, the furniture, the silverware and most of my jewelry, one piece at a time," she recalled.
 
Son Out of Work
 She now lives on Social Security, no longer entertains or goes to the theater and has taken "little jobs," with the Board of Elections and the Census Bureau. But the rent has more than doubled in the last year and there is nothing more to sell, "just bric-a-brac," she said.
Her 54-year-old son has been out of work for more than two years, and their financial situation continued to deteriorate. So did their relationship: Her son refused to leave when she tried to evict him. So the two of them continued to argue.
"I just couldn't manage anymore and needed help," she said in an interview.
 
Rebuilding Self-Esteem
 Lilian turned to the Jewish Association for Services for the Aged, a social-service agency, which also receives Neediest Cases funds through the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. The agency is providing Lilian with a rent supplement until she can find permanent affordable housing.
"I'm trying to help Lilian cope with the terrible assault on her self-esteem," said Doris Solomon, the social worker who now meets regularly with Lilian and her son.
Ms. Solomon has also helped Lilian's son get into a state job training program.
"JASA has been a big help, helping with the rent and easing the tension with my son," Lilian said. "But life is not the way it used to be."

HEADLINE: A Heritage of Giving: Remember the Neediest Cases Fund;
Catholic Charities Fill Gaps Families Can't

BYLINE: By NOAM COHEN

 BODY:
Charles Dickens once observed that the difference between happiness and misery is the difference between being a penny over budget and a penny under budget.
The Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of seven charities that receive money from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, assist the poor when budgets become unbalanced. 
 Often providing money at times of crisis, the charities can keep a family in its home while a dispute over government benefits is being settled, provide the means for a pregnant teen-ager to see a doctor or tide over the family of a recently laid-off worker with supplies from a food pantry.
As a major social-services contractor of the City of New York, the Catholic Charities send staff workers called homemakers to see families, many of whom have histories of neglected children. Money donated to the Neediest Cases allows the workers the discretion to give diapers or baby formula to families that need them.
 
Food, Diapers and Bunk Beds
 A typical reason families fall behind, said Kenneth Kimball, the director of family and children services, is a father who fails to provide child support.
"We use the money to fill in the gaps when the city can't react fast enough," Mr. Kimball said as he opened a closet on the sixth floor of the charities' offices in the headquarters of the Archdiocese of New York at 1011 First Avenue, near 55th Street.
Inside were packages of food and a three-foot high container of diapers. In Mr. Kimball's office were receipts for bunk beds and cribs.
The importance of the everyday products becomes telling when one realizes that families are hungry and children sleep on the floor, Mr. Kimball said.
 
Part of a Last-Ditch Effort
 And the needs are growing. Father Kevin Sullivan, director of the charities' department of social development, said, "We see people coming to the pantries earlier in the month."
Since most of these families are being monitored by homemakers because a court suspects trouble -- particularly drug abuse by a parent -- the supplies are part of a last-ditch effort to keep a family intact.
Last year, the midtown Manhattan office spent $32,133 for diapers and the like, and much of that money was provided by the Neediest Cases. Similar purchases were made in five other offices from Staten Island to East Harlem.
Founded in 1917, the Catholic Charities spend more than $15 million a year operating hospitals, shelters and nursing homes. Most of that money comes from parishoners' donations.
 
Society's Most Fragile Members
 The Neediest Cases gave the organization $561,442 after last year's drive. That amount was part of $771,911 that the charities spent on direct relief and staff services that assist the poor.
In recent years, the charities have seen more and more resources used to combat the effects of drug addiction and AIDS.
With the goal of smoothing over crises, the charities focus on society's most fragile members: teen-age mothers, illegal aliens, the homeless.
The bulk of the archdiocese's direct assistance is used to care for pregnant women and young mothers and children. Last year, $337,392 went to the charities' Maternity Services Ministry, which operates three shelters in the Bronx and Manhattan.
 
Back to Independent Living
 The newest shelter, which opened in May of 1989 in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, serves 18 women and their newborn children.
There is also a shelter for 19 pregnant homeless women on the Lower East Side and another for 12 women with newborn children in the Bronx.
The goal of the shelters is to lead the women back to independent living with their children, said Sister Una McCormack, executive director of the Catholic Home Bureau, which supervises the Maternity Services Ministry.
"We have been very successful in moving women out to their own apartments," she said. "Thank God, none of their children have gone into foster care."
Sister McCormack said that in some of the shelters, women who have moved into their own apartments return to talk to the current residents.
The people who run the charities say they have not seen a drop in donations from individuals, but know that their services are being particularly taxed when more and more families are facing crises related to the health of the economy.

HEADLINE: Awaiting the Call of the Big Leagues, Young Socialites Party on Their Own

BYLINE: By GEORGIA DULLEA

 BODY:
On the charity circuit, they are the not-ready-for-prime-time players. They have the evening clothes, the social connections and the philanthropic impulses. But they are not old enough or rich enough for serious galas at $500 to $1,000 a ticket and so, increasingly, they are running benefits on their own, on the cheap.
The juniors, as they are called, have a certain style. No gilded hotel ballrooms for them -- clubs are less expensive, more lively venues. No sit-down dinners -- only old people need to sit down. No society orchestras -- a deejay will do. And forget the fancy decorations -- the crowd is decorative enough. 
 The top ticket price for a junior party is $150, with many events around $100. Guests are mostly in their 20's and 30's, although some powers behind the benefits are in their 40's and musing about moving into the big time.
 
Reluctant Graduates

 
 Alfred (Chappy) Morris, who at 40 still gets invitations to debutante parties and bachelor balls, recently graduated to the list for $1,000 benefits. "I guess that's one way to tell you're a senior," he said.
He and other leaders of the Lobby Gallery Associates of the Whitney Museum have been pondering their status. One of them, Christine Mortimer Biddle, said, "With the economy, a lot of juniors can't afford to be seniors and yet they still want to support the charities."
Invitations to junior parties sometimes list members of the younger generations of old society families like the Rockefellers and the Phippses. But the names of fashion models, designers and musicians also draw juniors. And they love titles, no matter how questionable the lineage.
"You'll find a lot of committees headed by His Royal Highness So-and-So or Princess Whoever," said Polly Onet, who handles junior benefits for Gustavus Ober Associates, a public relations concern.
For Ms. Onet and other juniors, charity parties have become the place "to make connections, professional and social," she said. "With everything that's happening -- crime, AIDS -- people are leery about going to night clubs and staying out till 2 in the morning. They want to dress up, go out at a civil hour and, for $75 or so, meet attractive people."
 
Repaying Debts

 
 Juniors without the time or space to entertain at home pay back social debts with benefit tickets. "They'll buy a $1,000 table, invite 12 friends and that's their entertainment for the year," Ms. Onet said. "It's for a good cause and it's tax deductible."
Anyone who has done time on the charity circuit can remember when juniors amounted to "window dressing," as Lewis Ufland put it. He and other charity-event planners would set aside junior tables for committee members' children because "older people love to look at young people." "In the past, juniors were not treated as grown-ups," Mr. Ufland said. "Now they're doing their own parties and they're being taken seriously."
Juniors emerged as a fund-raising force in the mid-1980's when charity balls blazed and waves of young people got rich on Wall Street. As the decade ended, virtually every cause from the New York Public Library to the Guardian Angels had a cadre of young supporters.
 
'A Tough Year'

 
 Like seniors, juniors are scrambling these days to attract corporate donors and underwriters while holding the line on ticket prices. As Tav Berry, head of the junior committee of the Girl Scouts Council of Greater New York, put it: "Everybody's having a tough year. Asking $300 a couple is not the easiest sell."
Juniors do not deliver the big bucks as seniors do. Juniors' benefits that raise $30,000 are considered blockbusters. Charities see junior committees not only as fund-raising groups but also as training grounds for the next generation of Pat Buckleys and Nan Kempners.
"They have to start somewhere, " said Joanne de Guardiola, chairwomen of the Associates of Memorial Sloan-Kettering.
Mark Gilbertson, chairman of the Winter Ball at the Museum of the City of New York, said his group was grooming "future leaders of the museum, trustees and donors." He added, "A lot of people are from old New York families."
People from new New York families are on the Boys Harbor junior committee, though. For example, a co-chairwoman is Odette Cabrera, whose parents were born in the Dominican Republic and who attended prep school on scholarship.
Her group raised $25,000 at a recent $40-a-ticket black-tie benefit. "We could have charged $100," Ms. Carera said. "But we kept it low so everyone could join in, not just the elite and the affluent."
 
To Some, Older Is Better

 
 Not all juniors stick to their own circuit. Christopher Mason, the songwriter who twits both generations at society parties, prefers going to senior parties and paying junior prices.
He was among a throng of young people who paid $125-a-ticket to dance at a recent Metropolitan Museum of Art benefit after the $900 crowd had had dinner. "Frankly I find it much more interesting to have a good mix of the ages," he said. "I always liked being around old people, anyway."
Junior parties may be "tiresome even though one's getting a deliciously cheaper ticket," he said, adding that one cannot very well social-climb among one's peers.
"All of the juniors at the museum were zeroing in on people like Ivana and Nan Kempner, " Mr. Mason said. "Pat Buckley was surrounded by adoring young men. It was a very funny sight seeing the juniors and the older group mix."

 BODY:
The history of American numismatics would be incomplete without mentioning the notes of Norton I, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico.
The Imperial notes were issued from 1871 to 1880 and give testimony to one of the United States' most benevolent rulers. 
 Born in London in 1818, the future emperor accompanied his plebian parents to South Africa in 1820 where his father farmed and opened a ship's chandelry.
With the death of his father in 1843, Joshua Norton was left with a failing chandelry and by 1849 he joined the gold rush, which was heading for San Francisco. But Norton never left for the mines.
Instead he began provisioning the miners from his base in San Francisco. Joshua Norton & Co. bought and resold flour and coal, coffee and tea, liquor, bricks and rice. He took in a partner, but then dissolved the partnership. His warehouse burned down in the fire of 1851 and he rebuilt it.
Norton sold hides to London and speculated in mine stocks and real estate. By 1852, he was a respected member of San Francisco's business community and he was well on his way to becoming a millionaire.
Then he heard a rumor that China had prohibited the export of all rice and so he formed a syndicate to corner the rice market. He signed all the contracts himself and when shipment after shipment of rice was unloaded in San Francisco harbor, Norton was ruined.
His partners vanished and Norton was liable for all payments. He tried to get relief in the courts and failed.
By 1855 his $15,000 of remaining assets were sold to relieve his debts. In the middle of a recession, Norton found no way to recoup his losses. He disappeared.
Mythlike, however, Joshua Norton rose again. In the San Francisco Bulletin of Sept. 17, 1859, Norton proclaimed himself Norton I, Emperor of the United States.
His imperial residence was the Eureka Lodging House on Commercial Street, his trusted counselors and Praetorian Guards were his two dogs, Bummer and Lazarus. The imperial robes were an old donated army coat and navy trousers and boots.
His tall crown was a white beaver hat with a large plume. As one set of clothes wore out, new ones were donated. Gold epaulets appeared on the imperial shoulders and imperial walks were aided by a new cane.
Each day, Norton I wandered the streets of San Francisco, surveying his empire. He rectified all social ills by decree. The Emperor's proclamations appeared from time to time in San Francisco's newspapers, each a studied cure for the nation's ills.
Norton dissolved both the Democratic and Republican parties in the name of peace and he called for an end to the Civil War.
He also called for the abolition of Congress and then abolished it himself. The Emperor attended synagogue each Saturday and a Catholic or Protestant church each Sunday.
His business friends from his more successful years supported his few needs and the British Consul is thought to have paid many of the bills of the imperial household.
But by 1870, Norton's old friends were dying. So on Jan. 15, 1871 the printing firm of Cuddy & Hughes printed the first of a series of notes, which were tendered by The Imperial Government of Norton I.
Those first notes were for $5 each. But the Emperor must have had a difficult time passing them because he immediately started issuing notes for the imperial sum of 50 cents.
Each note promised to pay gold coin to the bearer in the amount of the listed sum plus 7 percent interest. At the maturity date of 1880, the bearer could convert each note into one payable in 1900.
This was probably a wise course as no notes were ever known to be redeemed. Instead they were kept as souvenirs and pasted in cafe windows as advertisements of imperial patronage.
The imperial treasury would generally issue just one or two of the 50 cent notes per day, paying for food and lodging.
By 1878, the bonds were so well received that the interest rate fell to 5 percent and by 1879, Emperor Norton I was issuing notes for $10.
Emperor Norton I died while walking the streets of San Francisco on Jan. 8, 1880. The police had to control the crowds at his funeral and today his notes are quite rare and valuable.

Bouncing Along Above the Low

 BODY:
IN a rough week, the dollar held up pretty well. That means it didn't set another record low, even though there were plenty of reasons for it to do so. The dollar started the week on a note of strength, having pierced the 1.50 level against the German mark. But then Saddam Hussein said he would release all of his hostages, defusing fears of a Gulf war and lessening the dollar's attraction as a safe harbor. The Government reported November employment data, which showed an economy falling even faster than expected with a loss of 267,000 non-farm jobs. And the Federal Reserve eased the Fed funds rate another quarter of a point, to 7.25 percent. The dollar fell under all this weight, but only to 1.4725 against the mark, a smidgen above its latest record low of 1.4705.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
When a Weak Dollar Is Useful

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
World stock markets have not been very kind to American investors this year. But the dollar has.
A sharp fall in the dollar in 1990 has shielded American investors in European markets from sharp losses. In Britain, for example, the dollar's drop against the pound turned a 11.2 percent stock market decline into a gain of 7.47 percent when translated back into dollars, according to the Financial Times World Indices. 
 And now that the dollar has also weakened against the yen, after rising sharply earlier this year, the losses in the Japanese stock market, the sharpest of any major market this year, have been trimmed by 14 percent.
Despite all that, "investing overseas is not a pure currency play," said John Ford, a director at Rowe Price-Fleming International in London, which manages several global mutual funds. "You should not move in and out on a pure currency view."
He is right. A currency forecast, just like any other, can be off base. The dollar was expected to decline this year, but few economists saw it falling to the depths it actually reached; some even thought it would be rising by now. And worrying too much about currency can rob an investor of nice stock gains over time.
Yet the dollar has played a key role in the last several years in overseas returns and it could do so again next year. Indeed, looking at overall returns for foreign markets without acknowledging the dollar component can be deceiving.
So what lies ahead? According to several current forecasts, the dollar will decline further at the beginning of the new year from the new lows that it reached this year against the mark and the Swiss franc. But it is expected to rise again by the end of 1991. If a dollar rally does occur, it would eat into what are already expected to be modest gains in many stock markets.
"It may not be a bad year for stock markets," said Geoffrey Dennis, chief international economist at James Capel Inc. in London. "But a rise in the dollar will really cut into those gains."
Analysts and economists generally agree that the dollar will continue to fall in early 1991 because the American economy appears to be in a recession, the Federal Reserve (as it did Friday) is expected to push interest rates lower, the German central bank is expected to raise interest rates in that country and the Japanese, at the least, will hold them steady. All this spells a lower dollar since higher rates abroad favor other currencies, and world capital will generally flow to growing economies, like Germany's.
But if the American recession is short-lived, the stage could be set for a dollar rally later in the year, say some forecasters, including those at Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and James Capel. Under this scenario, interest rates in the United States would stop falling, the stock market here would rally and foreign capital would flow in to reap the gains in the American market.
James Capel expects the dollar to reach the 1.70 range against the mark by the end of 1991, or a 15 percent increase from current levels, and nearly $1.68 against the British pound, an increase of 16 percent. Goldman Sachs forecasts slightly higher gains.
These increases, mirrored by the dollar's advances against other European currencies, would sharply curtail the gains -- or accentuate the losses -- in the European stock markets. As for the yen, the experts are divided. James Capel thinks the dollar will remain weak against the yen, meaning an investment in Japan could face little currency risk. But Goldman sees the dollar rising about 7 percent, which adds to the risk in this already turbulent market.
There is a haven abroad from this problem. It is Hong Kong, where the currency is closely tied to the dollar and there is almost no currency risk. Rowe Price-Fleming International predicts that Hong Kong and other Southeast Asia markets, excluding Japan, will be the fastest-growing next year. But as good as Hong Kong might be, it is too small a market in which to concentrate investments.
So a diversified investor cannot avoid the currency risk. But focusing on that risk, along with prospects for the foreign stock markets, means fewer surprises.

HEADLINE: The Tables Have Turned on Gambling

BYLINE: By N.R. KLEINFIELD

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
The cards slapped down on the baize blackjack tables in mind-numbing regularity. The roulette wheels spun, and the slots chattered incessantly, occasionally coughing up cups full of winnings, mostly just eating up dreams. Down at the Copacabana, Barry Manilow was singing. Billboards promised that Joan Rivers would be coming to Caesars. Outside, the air was brittle and the ocean waves were choppy. At Boardwalk Roger's Famous Hot Dogs, hot dogs twirled on their heating rollers, but only one customer came.
A middle-aged man with chiseled features and a thin mustache climbed out of his seat at one of the blackjack tables at Bally's. He gave a wave of disgust. A short-skirted hostess asked him if there was anything he would like. He said, "How about some more chips? They busted me." 
 He paused a moment to talk. "Last year, I used to come twice a month," he said. "If I blew a hundred, two hundred, I racked it up to bad cards. Now, I can't handle that. My car is eating money with these high gas prices. I'm worried about heating oil bills; I've got four bedrooms and a den. No way I stop coming to play the games. But it's once a month now. My wife said she'd get an ax after me if I came more often. My wife has a bit of a temper."
Masses of traffic still rush into Atlantic City, transporting the hopeful. But not as many, and not as often. Gloom has enveloped Atlantic City along with the entire casino industry.
In the past, gaming has been a business that has bragged that recessions couldn't touch it. No matter what bumps the economy hits, casino operators have insisted, people will always find the extra dollars to take a chance at the tables and the slots, the high rollers will still gravitate to the baccarat games. It is a tune that sounds flat these days. Throughout the glitzy gaming halls of Atlantic City, business is dwindling, evident most vividly in the grave turn in the fortunes of Donald Trump. And the problems of Atlantic City have begun to disturb Nevada, too, albeit to a much smaller extent. Depending on what happens with the cost of oil and the sagging economy, the problems could worsen with great rapidity.
"Everybody is getting hurt right now," said Raymond Neidl, a casino analyst with Dillon, Read & Company. "The whole industry is in trouble."
 
Failing a Test
 Earlier in the year, the feeling was that the crucial test for the industry would be midsummer. But July and August were bad; business hasn't improved much in the fall, and with the end of the year typically inconsequential in terms of generating high levels of play, the books are pretty much closed on what has been a despondent 1990 for casinos.
According to figures compiled by the New Jersey Casino Association, the 12 casinos in Atlantic City together lost $4.3 million in the second quarter, which marked the first time that had happened since gambling was allowed here in 1978. They managed to register a profit of $35.2 million in the third quarter, but that was less than half the $83.6 million earned a year ago. Las Vegas, which doesn't report complete numbers for its casinos in the same way Atlantic City does, has been faring better, though quite a few properties in both cities are heavily in debt and not well poised to sustain themselves in a protracted downturn in play.
"Three months from now you'll read that Las Vegas has the same problems that Atlantic City has because there's oversupply," said Jack Galloway, president of TropWorld, a casino in Atlantic City. "There are a lot of operators in Las Vegas who are real worried."
The problem is not so much that there isn't adequate business, but that too much debt has been strapped to many casinos. "The banks are really pulling in their horns now," Mr. Neidl said. "So debt maturations are becoming more important than ever."
Sheila O'Connell, a gaming analyst at Duff & Phelps in Chicago, estimates that Las Vegas casino revenues will grow about 7 percent this year and Atlantic City's will be flat. The last time Atlantic City had any big growth in gaming revenue was 1988, when revenues rose 9.6 percent. Next year she thinks Atlantic City's gambling revenues could fall and, although she is more pessimistic than some, that Las Vegas's might improve by no more than 4 to 6 percent.
Whether any casinos will actually silence their rackety one-armed bandits and close up remains unclear. But many casino operators express bitter disillusionment toward their prospects over the next year, should a bad recession set in.
 
Where It's Darkest
 Without doubt, the mood is darkest for the gambling parlors in Atlantic City. September was the first month since Donald Trump's much-ballyhooed Taj Mahal opened in April that total table drop -- the amount of chips bought at casinos -- fell from the prior year. Every casino in the city suffered a decline. October's drop was up just a little over 1 percent, and was down significantly if the Taj Mahal is not counted.
"The casinos will not be helped unless an actual casino floor is closed," said Harold Vogel, a media and gaming analyst at Merrill Lynch. "But I think the state of New Jersey will do everything to keep people employed. It will not be the first thing they would let happen."
If the casinos can ride out the sour economy, they could gain some curative benefits. "Maybe this pause is good, because it's made everyone look inside their organizations and cut costs," said Al Glasgow, a gaming consultant in Atlantic City who publishes Atlantic City Action, a newsletter tracking the casinos, and who occasionally consults for Donald Trump. "The big question is, 'Can the operators adjust to cut their costs or will they keep spending money to draw customers?' The old dilemma is coming into play for everyone: Is it better to lose market share and make money or is it better to lose money and hold on to market share?"
It is instructive to examine which sort of gambler has accounted for the bulk of the decline here. During the months of July, August and September, according to Mr. Glasgow, the table drop tumbled by some $55 million. Of that, $53 million was in chips paid for by credit. Generally speaking, lower-level gamblers acquire their chips for cash, while high rollers employ credit.
"The person who's a high roller, who gambles discretionary income, has cut back," said Mr. Galloway. "The person who has his own business, who gambles some of his extra income, he's cutting back. That's maybe 20 to 25 percent of the market. On the other hand, the bread-and-butter slot customers, the retired people on fixed income who come every other week for entertainment, are still coming down."
Casino operators worry that they are chasing a dwindling number of high rollers. But it is also vital that they attract enough "grind" play to cushion any losses to big players.
Among casino owners, the man in the deepest trouble is undoubtedly Donald Trump. He and his Trump Organization have been scrambling for most of the year to restructure the heavy debt on his three casinos. The opening of his glitzy Taj Mahal, by far the biggest casino in Atlantic City, has drained business from virtually every other casino in the city, while failing to attract enough business to cover its own debt payments.
Both the Taj Mahal and the Trump Castle had losses in the quarter ended Oct. 31, normally the strongest period of the year, while the Trump Plaza's income detriorated sharply.
 
Shallow Pockets
 Unable to come up with the cash to meet a $47.3 million interest payment due on Nov. 15 on the high-yield "junk bonds" sold to finance the Taj Mahal, Mr. Trump was forced two weeks ago to agree to a short trip to bankruptcy court and to give bondholders 50 percent of the equity in the gambling parlor, though he retains control.
His woes aren't over. On Dec. 15, a payment is due on Trump Castle junk bonds, and it is highly questionable whether he has the money to pay.
Being short millions of dollars in interest payments is not an uncommon malady going around Atlantic City and Las Vegas. The Chicago-based Bally Manufacturing Corporation, which owns three casinos in Nevada and one in Atlantic City, knows the symptoms all too well. Steeped in debt, it reported a third-quarter loss of $84.7 million and missed an $18.4 million payment to its bondholders.
In early October, Robert Mullane, Bally's chief executive, even told the board he would quit if that was what they wanted. They kept him -- for two weeks. By mid-October, he was gone.
Casino operators are confronted with a deft juggling act. They are fearful of deep reductions in marketing expenses for they don't want to lose market share. But they must trim expenses wherever they can.
Many of the casinos are cutting back on chartered bus excursions, trips in which casinos dole out chips and meal vouchers in advance to get people to visit their gaming floors. People who come to town by bus do not bet as much as those who arrive in their own cars. Any number of bus riders, in fact, do nothing more than waltz into the casino that provided them with chips, cash them in, and stroll off to the boardwalk.
All in all, the casinos would dearly love to move their client base more heavily toward people in cars.
According to an analysis done by Mr. Glasgow, the consultant, the number of people bused to Atlantic City in October dropped by nearly 107,000, or 10 percent, from the level of October 1989, before the Taj Mahal had opened. The drop followed a 7 percent decline in September.
At the same time, analysts say, many casinos have been reducing middle management. John Giovenco, president of the Hilton Nevada Corporation, the Hilton Hotels subsidiary that runs four Nevada gaming properties, said that its back-of-the-house personnel has been cut about 6 to 7 percent. Mr. Galloway of TropWorld has required all casino employees to take a week's vacation without pay between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Mr. Galloway himself is down for Dec. 13. His wife and he are talking about going skiing.
 
Save It or Make It?
 Cost cutting will save money. However, casinos still need to build revenues to make money. As Mr. Glasgow put it in a recent newsletter: "The theme of the day for Atlantic City operators is cost containment. However, you only save money by cutting costs -- you must have revenues to make money. It is truly the day of the hands-on operator."
While winnings at the Nevada casinos rose more than 13 percent during the first eight months of the year, there is widespread concern about what will happen if the bad economy heads west. Higher fuel prices are a particular worry, since more than 40 percent of visitors go by plane.
Hotel rooms and casino space have grown enormously in Nevada, and plenty of debt exists. "There are a lot of operations in Las Vegas that are substantially leveraged, which puts a lot of pressure on them to be competitive," said Henry Gluck, chairman of Caesars World Inc., which owns Caesars Palace, long one of the most successful casinos in Las Vegas. "And there's been a lot of capacity added in the last year and a half."
In Las Vegas, the November 1989 opening of the Mirage, which cost about $615 million to build, followed by the Excaliber, the world's largest casino hotel, in June, have injected the city with a tremendous amount of new capacity. Together, the two facilities added 7,000 hotel rooms to the 69,000 already there.
The 3,100-room Mirage, which is next door to Caesars Palace, likes to characterize itself as a resort rather than a hotel, and has tried to lure the young, well-off family crowd who might enjoy such things as bottlenose dolphins and the volcano outside that spews steam and fire into the air. It is a marvel to visit. Throngs have.
As the Mirage celebrates its first anniversary, Steve Wynn, chairman of the parent Golden Nugget Corporation, said that, with revenues of $600 million to $650 million, it has well exceeded his expectations.
But the Mirage has forced other casinos to spend money to keep up. Caesars Palace has refurbished its rooms, though it did not build any new ones as a number of analysts felt it should. "It's more important," Mr. Gluck said, "that people come and play the games than actually stay at the hotel." Caesars, like other casinos, has had to hand out more complimentary rooms and meals, he said. It has also told its three "people movers" to be more aggressive in bringing people in. "They almost act like vacuum cleaners," he said.
Many of the Vegas hotels have chopped their room rates to try to stimulate business. At some hotels, rates have fallen to as low as $35 to $60 a night, from $45 to $100 a year ago, and guests can also often pick up free meal and show tickets. Regular patrons who gamble heavily are usually accorded free rooms.
A big question mark hanging over Las Vegas is the prospect of ground being broken next year on the MGM Grand Hotel & Theme Park. If it opens, as planned, in 1992, it will bring another 5,000 rooms to the city.
In Reno, another large gambling city in Nevada, business has been worse than in Las Vegas. Casino revenues have flattened out, and were down in October. Just weeks ago, the owners of two Reno casinos -- Harold's Club and the Nevada Club -- said their properties were for sale because they couldn't afford the renovations needed to stay competitive.
Still, because Nevada attracts a wide base of customers, gaming analysts expect it to ride out a bad economy.
 
Storms in the East
 Atlantic City faces a murkier future. It has yet to develop as the full-fledged family resort and convention center that Las Vegas has. It is also a tawdry city, riddled with social ills. Most people come to Atlantic City just for the day or the weekend, whereas visitors linger much longer in Las Vegas.
Casino owners hope that what appears to be a warming regulatory attitude will enable it to get some of the treats -- longer gambling hours and permission to offer new games -- it feels it needs to spark future growth. There is the promise that the city will get parimutual horse betting, which exists along with sports betting in Las Vegas, and some additional casino games.
Meanwhile, casino operators cross their fingers.
"While the gaming industry is not recession-proof, it is more recession-proof than most businesses," said Mr. Gluck. "A lot would have to happen for people to stop going to conventions. And when people are under a lot of pressure, they still want to go on vacations and sit down at the tables and take a shot."
 
A LONG SHOT CALLED LAUGHLIN
 Being watched with considerable curiosity among casino operators is a town 90 miles south of Las Vegas that has emerged in the last few years as a hotbed of gambling. This is Laughlin, a dusty town where the rooms are cheap, the food is simple and the gambling is free of assertive electronic gadgetry.
For the most part, this has been a gambling den for the blue-collar crowd. But the town is being transformed at a frenzied pace. Huge new projects have sprung up, intended to draw younger and more affluent customers. The population has gone from 95 in 1984 to more than 5,000.
"It's small and low key and has the ambience of an Old West city," said Sheila O'Connell, a gaming analyst at Duff & Phelps. "Until recently, it was kind of a secret. They're getting great occupancy rates there, but if they keep putting up building after building, it could lose its ambience. The people investing there have to be careful. They don't want to go crazy on growth."
There have been some signs of stretched debt in Laughlin, too. An interest payment was missed a couple of weeks ago on Sam's Town Gold River Hotel & Casino. The owner, a partnership called John Midby & Associates, said it is hopeful that a suitable arrangement will be worked out. The partnership is currently putting up a second casino on a new golf course it built in Laughlin.
Hilton Hotels, which opened a 2,000-room, $190 million resort in Laughlin in August, admitted that it misjudged the depth of the market, and caused occupancy rates to drop throughout Laughlin. John Giovenco, who oversees Hilton's casinos, said that occupancy rates have fallen to 75 percent or so, from 90 percent and up.

 
 
TRIPPING ON THE BONDS
 Want fantastic yields? Don't mind big risks? It's not necessary to catch a bus to Atlantic City or a plane to Vegas. Buy some casino bonds.
The high-yield bonds that have financed many of the gambling parlors have recently been one of the worst-performing groups in the high-yield market. Since the beginning of June, according to Richard Byrne, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, the average prices of casino bonds have fallen more than 32.7 percent.
Yields on some bonds -- such as those of the beleaguered Trump Castle -- have been running as as high as 50 percent, and many are yielding 20 to 30 percent. Yields, of course, don't mean all that much if the issuers don't make the payments, an increasingly common habit among casino owners.
"The average yield for casino bonds is about 35 percent," said Raymond Neidl, an analyst with Dillon, Read. "That tells you something about the interest in them right now."
Though Mr. Byrne acknowledges that many casino bonds seem to be undervalued at their current prices, he thinks that continued softeness in the casino industry will keep those prices from improving for a while.
"I'm not ready to call the bottom of this market yet," he said.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
What Brokers Are Pushing

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
For many investors, picking a mutual fund from the 3,000-plus funds available is like finding a needle in a haystack. So many turn to stockbrokers for guidance. Which funds are they pitching?
Dalbar Financial Services, a Boston-based research firm, asked nearly 500 top-selling stockbrokers for their recommendations among the independent fund groups. These groups account for about 45 percent of the $538 billion invested in stock and bond funds today, according to Avi Nachmany, an analyst with Strategic Insight, mutual fund consultants in New York. They exclude funds sold directly to investors, like Fidelity's, and fund groups, like Merrill Lynch and Shearson, sold through their own brokers. 
 What are the favorites? The top broker pick is the $800 million Oppenheimer Global Fund. Its biggest holdings are in health care, said Ken Oberman, the fund's manager, because "as a country's per capita income rises, a bigger percentage of its gross national product goes to health care." Three favorite drug companies: Astra, in Sweden; Novo-Nordisk, in Denmark, and Schering in Germany. He also likes energy companies, particularly Saga Petroleum, in Norway, and the Moeller Companies, in Denmark.
How well has the fund done? A performance measure devised by Morningstar Inc., Chicago-based mutual funds consultants, ranks funds compared to all others of their type. A 1.0 rank is average and a 1.20 rank means a fund performs 20 percent better than its peers. All the broker favorites have solid ratings, reflecting performance in the past 3, 5 or 10 years (depending on the fund's age). Oppenheimer Global, for example, had a 1.21 rating. Besides performance, however, brokers also look at other factors, such as service provided by the fund group.
 Two funds tied for the No. 2 spot among brokers. One was the $4.9 billion Washington Mutual Investors Fund (ranking: 1.33), sponsored by Capital Research and Management, in Los Angeles, a growth-and-income fund that invests in conservative, dividend-paying stocks. About 15 percent of its holdings are in telecommunications. Two favorites: Southwestern Bell and Pacific Telesis. The fund also invests heavily in banking stocks. Many of its holdings "are undervalued, and well-diversified banks that follow prudent investing standards and will have an above-average return over the next five years," said Stephen E. Bepler, the fund's co-manager. His picks: Banker's Trust and Wells Fargo.
The other No. 2 fund was the $1.2 billion Oppenheimer Equity-Income Fund (1.16). It has moved nearly one-third of its assets into cash. Among its stock holdings (53 percent), manager Susan Wilder likes the electric utilities. She says the group is "boring," but adds, "in the environment I see for the next six to nine months, boring may be beautiful." She likes Texas Utilities and the FPL Group.
Another favorite was the $5.3 billion Investment Company of America (1.20), a Capital Research growth-and-income fund that invests in "large, strong, well-diversified companies," said Peter Langer, the group's senior vice president. Its biggest holdings: Phillip Morris, Merck and I.B.M.
The $2.1 billion American Capital Pace Fund (1.31), sponsored by American Capital Asset Management, in Houston, is betting the biggest chunk of its portfolio on the energy sector. S. Peter Hidalgo 2d, the fund manager, likes Texaco and Schlumberger, a French company, and has nearly doubled his financial services holdings since the beginning of the year, to 6 percent. Two favorites: NCNB, the Charlotte-based banking company, and BancOne, in Columbus.
The $1.45 billion GT Europe Growth Fund (1.45) invests in blue-chip stocks, with its biggest holdings in Britain (23 percent), Germany (20 percent) and France (14 percent). John Legat, the London-based fund manager, says British stocks "have underperformed for some time now and those stocks look relatively undervalued." He expects "a good runup in a select group of stocks in the next six to nine months." Two of his picks: British Gas and Northwest Water.
That said, a few provisos: All the recommended funds have a sales charge because that's how brokers earn their living. And some are quite steep. When there are so many funds without fees around -- the 100% No-Load Mutual Fund Council, a New York City-based trade group, counts 130 funds among its members that have no sales charges and represent $25 billion in assets -- why should anyone pay fees? People who are short on time or energy to manage their investments find them an easy solution. A good broker will do the legwork and monitor performance. You get some handholding, too.
While the commission that brokers earn clearly is a factor in their recommendations, it is not the overriding one. The brokers who survived the shakeout after the 1987 crash are a sturdy lot. "They take a more sophisticated, risk-conscious and long-term point of view," said Don Phillips, vice president of Morningstar. "They're selling funds with good track records, because they recognize that success is measured by keeping clients satisfied, not by this month's sales."
 
JUGGLING THE SHORT-TERM OPTIONS
 People tend to flee to short-term funds when the market gets tough and they are usually good bets because their prices tend to fluctuate less than long-term investments. But there is potential risk. Yields are high, but the principal-only return -- reflecting changes in the value of fund shares, without yield -- can drop. That risk is always there, but short-term investors seem to pay less attention to it because their investments fluctuate less than long-term ones.
What's more, all short-term funds are not alike. Money-market funds are relatively safe investments. But world income funds are riskiest -- and their yields reflect that -- because of the currency plays involved. If you don't choose carefully, "the price movements may be more than you bargained for," said Stephen A. Schoepke, an analyst with Lipper Analytical Services. You must decide how nimble you can be and how much risk you can live with.

Europe Can't Heal Britain's Economy

BYLINE: By STEVEN RATTNER; Steven Rattner is a general partner at Lazard Freres & Company.

 BODY:
With a speed astonishing to most Americans, Britain has selected John Major as its new Prime Minister. But changes in Britain's economic policies or in the parlous state of its economy may be much slower in coming.
At the moment, Britain is in the midst of classic stagflation: double-digit inflation, rising unemployment and declining gross national product. And, while Britain's economic forecasters are holding out hope of an orderly recovery, the expectations for that upturn are more often attributed to the natural economic cycle than to any particular policy prescription.
Mr. Major appears likely to reject one popular notion -- that greater economic integration with Europe will somehow smoothly restore Britain's economy to good health. In principle, economic integration is a good thing: classic theory suggests that freer trade should benefit all participants. But economic integration in and of itself is no more likely to cut inflation and increase output in Britain than Massachusetts' could escape its difficulties by unifying with California.
The British fascination with European integration manifests itself in the notion of linking the pound with other European currencies and eventually creating a single currency to supplement or even replace the traditional units of exchange. But such a return to fixed exchange rate policies -- and it was Mr. Major who pushed Mrs. Thatcher into entering the current European exchange rate mechanism -- carries at least as much baggage as benefit.
Because Britain's economy is not competitive with countries like Germany, maintaining the pound's assigned position in the constellation will take high domestic interest rates or direct intervention in foreign exchange markets or both. The first, which amounts to giving the Bundesbank a major voice in British economic policy, almost insures a continued slow domestic economy. That could well prove as politically hazardous for Mr. Major, who must face a general election by June 1992, as it did for Mrs. Thatcher. The latter tactic has been proved in many other countries to be extremely costly and of little efficacy for anything other than correcting short-term imbalances in foreign exchange markets.
When it comes to matters like the poll tax, change will come quickly from Mr. Major -- and the betting is that the tax will be scrapped. Imagine an American leader deciding to abolish the property tax -- which at least bears some relationship to individual wealth -- and to substitute a per capita charge that would not vary regardless of whether one's income was $10,000 or $10 million. It took extraordinary arrogance and insensitivity to believe that such a policy would be politically acceptable. Mr. Major will inevitably move toward raising revenue based on ability to pay.
Peculiarly, Britain's real difficulty is the same root problem Mrs. Thatcher found, albeit to a far lesser degree: an extraordinarily rigid and uncompetitive economy unable to produce goods and services as efficiently as trading partners. Mrs. Thatcher's biggest misjudgment was her belief that five years of monetary discipline would be enough to bring a period of strong economic growth after those policies were relaxed in 1986.
But after relaxation, inflation immediately shot up, to its current peak of more than 10 percent. In response, the Thatcher Government began to increase interest rates in late 1988, ultimately more than doubling the base rate to 15 percent and bringing economic growth to a halt. Now the country is mired in recession. The Confederation of British Industry recently forecast that the economy would contract by 1 percent in 1991. Unemployment is now expected to rise into 1992.
When the British economy was stimulated, the result was not higher domestic output but higher imports and higher inflation. For while productivity jumped in the 1987-88 boomlet, the most recent results on output per head in manufacturing showed only a 0.2 percent increase compared with a year earlier. Meanwhile, average earnings grew by 10.25 percent.
How John Major will address these most important problems remains to be seen. He emphasizes his opposition to inflation and his commitment to a classless society. He surrounds himself with bright young economists like Mervyn King and Gavyn Davies. He emphasizes that he is his own man, not a Thatcher clone or stooge. But success will depend on finding the path to freeing up Britain's economy, not only through strict macroeconomic policies and free markets, but through other avenues like education and training.
It's fine for Britain to welcome Mr. Major as part of a needed change. But it is an economic illusion for Britain to believe that its problems resided with Mrs. Thatcher or the rest of Europe or anywhere but with Britain itself. To proceed on any other foundation risks merely returning Britain to the unappetizing economic state in which Mrs. Thatcher inherited it.

Trading an Ad for a Bucket of Bolts

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
There were lots of things the McDonnell-Douglas Helicopter Company could do with the $16 million worth of nuts, bolts, washers and screws cluttering up its warehouses. It could keep them, at a huge carrying cost. It could sell them to liquidators, for maybe 3 cents on the dollar. Or it could trade them for goods and services.
"We went over every possibility for getting the most out of these excess materials, and trade was by far the best," said Gary Pacific, McDonnell's manager of countertrade. He struck a deal with a so-called reciprocal trade company, which gave him credits to use on hotel rooms, airline tickets, car rentals -- even telecommunications consulting services -- in exchange for the hardware. 
 With recession looming large, more companies are seeking new ways to turn excess capacity or materials into assets. The result is that barter, long common in international trade, is getting popular domestically, too.
Paul E. Suplizio, executive director of the International Reciprocal Trade Association, in Alexandria, Va., guesses that the various forms of barter specialists handled trades worth more than $5 billion this year, and that the number is about to soar. "I'm getting a lot more calls from people who hope that barter will help them move excess inventories during the coming recession," he said.
Some companies are doing the trades themselves. Some are going through barter exchanges that, for a flat annual fee plus a 10 percent per-trade commission, serve as middlemen for companies that want to trade. Others, like McDonnell-Douglas, deal with reciprocal trade companies that will themselves take possession of excess products, pay for them in trade credits, then try to sell them elsewhere for cash.
 There are plenty of reasons to barter even aside from the current economic malaise.
Broadcasters, cruise lines and other companies with high fixed costs but low costs of delivering excess products use barter as a crucial source of financing, particularly when they are starting up. For example, when ESPN Inc. was still a fledgling cable sports channel, Icon International Inc., a New York "barter finance" company, provided it with some expensive broadcasting equipment in exchange for a stream of 30-second commercial time slots.
"We loved the concept of acquiring needed equipment without any out-of-pocket costs," said Robert M. Jeremiah, ESPN's vice president of advertising sales. For its part, Icon was able to resell the blocks of commercial time at such a nice profit that it got a four-fold payback on its investment in equipment, said Lance B. Lundberg, Icon's president.
Manufacturers of tangible goods use barter to keep production on an even keel, so that neither machines nor workers sit idle in sluggish times. "When we've got a mill that can make 11 million cases, but our marketing people think we can only sell 10 million, it's nice to know we can barter any excess," said Robert J. Monusky, manager of advertising services at the James River Corporation, which routinely trades surplus Dixie cups or paper towels for advertising space.

FOR others, barter is a competitive tool. Susan Groenwald, president of the Chicago Barter Corporation, a barter exchange, tells of a pest-control company that landed a huge hotel-chain account by agreeing to take part of its payment in room credits. "To my mind, the most important thing about barter is that it brings new customers," she said.
She gets no argument from Jerry Markbreit, trade and barter manager for the 3M Corporation's advertising services group, which sells advertising space on some 30,000 outdoor billboards. He recently traded space on one of them to a cash-strapped airline in exchange for air-freight credits, which he then "sold" to 3M's traffic division for use in shipping 3M products.
"The traffic department saved about 50 percent on its cost for freight, we got to sell billboards we would otherwise have been stuck with, and most important, we were able to service a customer," Mr. Markbreit said.
When barter is timed right, it can help a supplier, too. Alfred Eisenberg, president of Creative Industries, a Chicago manufacturer of insulated packaging material, trades excess packaging for such perennial needs as advertising space. But his favorite deals are those that let both partners capitalize on each other's slow times. Recently he traded packaging for a new driveway, put in by a contractor during his slow season. "If you plan your needs to coincide with other people's down times, you get really good deals through trade," he said.
 
 
WHY IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK
 Barter's contraints are as considerable as its benefits. Among them:
* Desired goods may not be available for trade. That's why the Xerox Corporation, for one, has all but stopped bartering. "We could not find things that we wanted to trade for," said a Xerox spokesman.
* It can cut into cash sales. ESPN Inc. maintains a constant vigil to ensure that ESPN air time is not being bartered to any company that is buying time for cash, or that an ESPN salesman is trying to cultivate.
* It can alienate distributors. The 3M Corporation readily barters space on its billboards, but will not trade any of its tangible products. "We don't want our products showing up somewhere at a discounted price because some liquidator got hold of them," said Jerry Markbreit, 3M's barter specialist.
* It can cause tax problems. Tax laws require companies to pay taxes on the value of credits from a barter exchange at the time the credits are issued, even though the company may not book them as income until they are used. And, the Internal Revenue Service still insists on being paid cash.

HEADLINE: California Showing Hopeful Signs of Political Regeneration

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I think recent events in California might be interpreted differently from "California Tried Democracy, and Look What's Happened Now" (The Week in Review, Nov. 18).
You state that in California "the end of politics has begun" and point out, for example, that Californians rejected 22 of 28 initiatives while passing an initiative that limits legislators' terms and expenses.
You also note that a movement to limit the power of initiatives is growing in California, a movement that one of those 22 failed initiatives attempted to counter -- the one that would have required voters to approve any change in the state's initiative and referendum process.
Upon these and a few other events suggesting governmental gridlock seems to rest your pessimism about California politics.
Yet we might find signs of hope for the regeneration of the political process in California -- and perhaps (just perhaps) a harbinger of change in the country itself.
In the long run, the results -- especially the limited terms of office -- might suggest an invigorating, maybe even vital spirit of regeneration in California politics. Without doubt, some senior lawmakers will have to start looking for a new job. But the space they create as they seek work elsewhere could offer California an opportunity to create a resurgence in representative democracy as new candidates vie for political office without the promise of long-term careers in the Legislature. That Californians were unwilling to pass bond and tax measures in this election might suggest a concern by citizens about fiscal responsibility, about growing state indebtedness and about a possible future economic slowdown.
Perhaps the earlier passage of Proposition 13, which limited property tax increases, and Proposition 103, which was intended to roll back insurance premiums, indicates similar worries about where money goes to work. Californians have passed initiatives that control the growth of government spending or the direction in which tax revenues should flow.
Most important, the burden of success for lawmaking and policy shaping in California may now lie more squarely on the shoulders of each voter -- where it should in a working democracy. What may be needed, rather than pessimism about the demise of politics, is a call for a more involved, educated and informed electorate to detect the shenanigans of initiative salesmen and to think more frequently about the qualities of the men and women they give the power to shape and manage government.

HEADLINE: Buying Groups Can Lower Fuel Costs

 BODY:
The informative article "Does a Switch From Oil to Gas Heat Make Sense?" [Oct. 28] fails to describe how Long Islanders who may not have the capital to switch from oil to gas can immediately start saving. Joining a fuel-buying group is the short-term answer to the escalating home-heating-oil prices.
Long Islanders are currently forced to pay wartime prices for home-heating oil. Nassau and Suffolk residents can start saving money immediately by joining a not-for-profit fuel-buying group whose price is tied to their regional wholesale price. The savings from increased economics of scale and decreased marketing costs are passed directly to the consumer.
The New York Public Interest Research Group Inc. Fuel Buyers Groups pools the purchasing power of its more than 12,000 members to negotiate discounts on No. 2 home-heating oil with reputable oil dealers on Long Island and nearby.
Nypirg's analysis shows that spot crude prices have increased about 34 cents a gallon, while wholesale home-heating oil has increased 35 cents a gallon and retail prices 45 cents a gallon between Aug. 19 and Oct. 30. Therefore, today due to the instability in the Middle East, Long Islanders are paying an additional 45 percent on their home-heating-oil bills.
Wholesale has dropped about 10 cents a gallon since its peak on Oct. 12, while retail home-heating oil has not dropped a penny in the same period.
At current price levels, the average consumer can expect to pay an additional $200 to $500 on their home-heating-oil bills this winter.
Nypirg asks oil companies to pass along decreases immediately. However, consumers are now experiencing the "sticky pricing phenomenon."

HEADLINE: The Role of Demand in the Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Hidden Pep in the American Economy" (Oct. 7) argues that the ability of various industries to expand supply determines economic growth. The article gives almost no attention to the role of demand.
In some instances inability to increase supply does limit growth, but I believe lack of demand is the main reason. Ask anyone of our automobile companies or anyone in the steel industry, for example.
Consumption expenditures make up 65 per cent of our gross national product. They provides the gas that fuels our economy. A major reason we have had eight years without a recession is the Federal deficit and the fact that consumers have maintained their buying by borrowing large amounts of money.
Because of the size of our national debt, we must reduce the Federal deficit. But because of the recessionary character of our economy, this must be done without reducing consumer spending.
The important role consumers play is graphically illustrated by what happened before the Great Depression. In the late 1920's, productivity and production increased rapidly. Organized labor was weak, so wage increases were too slow to enable workers to buy the increased output. These conditions led to depression.
The New Deal helped get us out of the depression, but Congress was unwilling to vote enough money to do the job. By 1933, almost 13 million people were unemployed, roughly 25 per cent of the labor force. In 1940, 8 million people still were out of work. We then began to prepare for World War II. Restrictions on spending vanished. Unemployment was rapidly reduced, reaching the almost unbelievable level of 640,000 by 1944.
If Congress passes legislation that seriously reduces consumer spending, and it seems they are determined to do this, we are likely to have a serious depression. Let us hope it doesn't take a war to get us out of it.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Supports New Game To Aid City's Police Hiring

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said today that he would push for quick passage of New York City's anti-crime plan, but insisted that any new city lottery game created to generate money for the plan not siphon revenues from existing state lotteries.
The compromise plan, unveiled by Mayor David N. Dinkins and Speaker Peter F. Vallone of the New York City Council earlier this week, would result in the hiring of nearly 3,500 new police officers over the next six years. It would rely for financing on a property-tax increase of up to $25 for every homeowner in the city, extension of the city income-tax surcharge and creation of a new city lottery game. 
 While the Mayor has urged passage of the plan during the Legislature's special session here this month, top lawmakers have said the package will be difficult to put together and may have to wait until the Legislature begins a new session in January.
Mr. Cuomo, whom some Dinkins administration officials have criticized for not helping to promote an earlier, more expensive anti-crime plan offered by the Mayor, cast himself today as Mr. Dinkins's chief supporter for speedy passage of a plan.
 
 Do It Quickly, Cuomo Says
 "The timing is critical," the Governor said in a telephone interview. "If you push it off to January, it may get lost in a maze of other problems." The city is scheduled to revise its revenue forecasts then, and some officials fear that worsening economic news could deflate support for speedy approval of the plan.
Still, some top officials here appeared to see less urgency than the Governor did in getting the plan passed right away. "If it gets done, it gets done," said Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat. "If not, we'll do it when we come back in January."
It remains unclear whether the package can be worked out this month. Several upstate lawmakers have expressed concerns that the city lottery could take money away from existing lotteries, whose profits go into a fund for public schools across the state, while lawmakers from throughout New York have insisted on legal guarantees that most of the money be used for hiring police officers.
Given the wide support from city officials for higher property taxes and the extension of the income-tax surcharge, whose rate varies by income level, few state lawmakers here have described the taxes themselves as objectionable.
The Governor's comments on the lottery, which came at a morning news conference in the Capitol, appeared intended to allay fears that the city would be allowed to shift money from the general state education fund to its crime program.
 
 Scratch-Off Lottery Game
 City officials publicly thanked the Governor for his pledge to help secure passage of the anti-crime plan, but appeared noncommittal on guarantees that the state's own lottery revenues would be protected.
"We are confident that we can work out a plan that addresses the city's needs as well as the state's concerns about its own fiscal picture," Mr. Vallone said in a prepared statement. A spokeswoman for Mayor Dinkins, Jennifer Kimball, said it would be "very difficult to analyze" the Governor's lottery plan until Monday.
Under the Governor's proposal, outlined today by the state lottery director, Peter D. Lynch, the city could create a new scratch-off lottery game for the crime plan to market along with an existing scratch game that lottery officials feel is widely underused.
 
 Buffalo Bets Differently
 Buffalo residents, Mr. Lynch noted, spend about twice as much per person on the current scratch game as New York City residents do; they in turn widely outspend Buffalo residents on the Lotto jackpot contests.
Any revenues from the new scratch game could go to the city's crime fund as long as total net revenues from the existing scratch-off game sold in the city remained at its present level of about $25 million annually, Mr. Lynch said. If not, revenues from the new game would have to go to the state. Mr. Lynch said he "could not conceive" of the new scratch game's cutting into revenues for the separate Lotto jackpots.

HEADLINE: Suit Dismissed on Pine Barrens Construction

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIVERHEAD, L.I., Dec. 6

 BODY:
In a victory for builders in Suffolk County, a State Supreme Court judge has dismissed an environmental group's lawsuit that sought to block all development within the environmentally sensitive Pine Barrens region of Long Island.
Judge Paul J. Baisley ruled that more than 230 construction projects in the Pine Barrens, 100,000 acres of fragile land crucial in replenishing the Island's underground water supply, would be allowed to go forward without any study of their cumulative environmental impact. 
 The Long Island Pine Barrens Society had tried to block the projects by arguing that state environmental laws required all of the proposed developments be studied together before any could proceed. But in denying the group's request on Wednesday, Judge Baisley said that no specific provision required such study.
Richard L. Amper Jr., executive director of the society, said the ruling had been anticipated and would be appealed. "These matters are never resolved in the lower court, and we'll take it to the Appellate Division," he said. "I would be very surprised if we saw asingle project built as a result of this ruling."
But Walter M. Conlon, a partner in Mars, Sloane & Conlon, a firm representing some of the builders, said the decision was a victory for property owners and meant that development throughout the Pine Barrens could proceed.
"This decision has clarified a very important aspect of the environmental process," he said. "It has cleared the air to enable people to make freer decisions with their property. It means that there is a definition as to how far a municipality has to go with its environmental impact statement." It is not known how many of the 230 projects on Long Island -- where, as elsewhere, the weak economy has hurt development -- will be renewed because of the judge's decision. Some of the projects were in the initial planning stages when the suit was filed; others were ready for permits to break ground.
Under the State Environmental Quality Review Act, builders are required to prepare environmental impact statements of proposed projects. In an earlier case the Pine Barrens Society cited in its legal argument, the State Court of Appeals had ruled that a cumulative impact study had to be done of more than 10 projects in a 295.5-acre section of the Albany Pine Bush. But a cumulative study involving hundreds of projects in three different towns, which is what the Pine Barrenslawsuit had sought, was unprecedented.
Lewis B. Oliver Jr., the lawyer for the environmental group, said that Judge Baisley had misread the Pine Bush decision by construing that there were three criteria to be met to require a cumulative impact statement. Mr. Oliver said there are two criteria -- that the land be environmentally sensitive and that development threaten to endanger it -- and the Pine Barrens met both.
 
A 'Chill' on Development
 "The Pine Barrens Society should have won the case because the judge made all the findings that the court made in the Pine Bush case and more," Mr. Oliver said.
Mr. Conlon said the decision would help the economy in Suffolk County,where building, already suffering because of the weak economy, has been curtailed by the lawsuit. "What this did in the Pine Barrens was create a chill on the preparation of property for ultimate use," in which developers did not want to spend money on preliminary work and banks did not want to commit money, he said.
The Pine Barrens' lawsuit also sought to stop the projects by claiming that the county and town agencies charged with granting permits should have considered publicly acquiring the land, rather than letting it be developed. Again, Judge Baisley ruled that there was no such provision in state environmental law.

HEADLINE: Trash Department Recycling Effort Criticized

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
Public officials and environmental groups assailed the New York City Sanitation Department on Friday for failing to aggressively pursue recycling.
At a City Council hearing, department officials were criticized for poor management, excessive recycling budget cuts, favoring incineration and not supplying information required by the city's 20-month-old recycling law. 
 "The Sanitation Department has simply reneged on its legal and public obligations to pursue recycling," City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman said. "The only thing the Department ofSanitation consistently recycles are its excuses."
Steven M. Polan, Sanitation Commissioner, responded that the law had unrealistic timetables and goals. He acknowledged, as he has before, that the program has major problems concerning collection costs and the ability to process recyclables.
Residents are separating about 6 percent of the city's garbage. Twenty-nine of 59 community boards, or almost 2 million households, are involved.
The recycling law, passed in April 1989, calls for separating 25 percent of the city's trash by April 1994. The law was passed to reduce the amount ofgarbage dumped at the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island.
The city's financial problems have forced the department to cut its $79 million annual operating budget by about 15 percent and delay until July 1 expanding recycling into 11 community districts in Brooklyn and the Bronx.
Mr. Polan said on Friday that the delay could help the department refocus attention on neighborhoods that have started recycling but are lagging in participation. A delay of more than six months would be "counterproductive," he said.
Sheldon S. Leffler, a City Councilman from Queens and one of the recyclinglaw's authors, said that nearly two years after the program began, an effective management team was still not in place. He said 25 of 70 people in the recycling division had left.
Mr. Polan, who became Commissioner in June, responded that "the fundamental problem is not management; it's economics."
"We have to bring down the cost of this program to make it successful," he said.
The department had expected recycling collection to cost $65 a ton when operating fully in a few years, Mr. Polan said, but if collection did not become more efficient, the cost could be $300 a ton.
One way to reduce costs would be to modify work practices of unionized workers, he said. Council members on Friday criticized those workers for notcooperating with attempts to increase productivity.
Mr. Polan said that because recycling had reduced the amount of garbage left on the street, collection trucks were finishing early. He has proposed extending the collection routes to increase productivity, which will be addressed in ongoing contract talks.
"This is a heck of a state of affairs," said Enoch H. Williams, chairman of the Council's Environmental Protection Committee. "We're paying people and we're not doing anything."
A spokesman for the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association, Jim Grossman, said, "They're not back there loafing around."

HEADLINE: STATES TRY TO CUT COST OF INSURANCE FOR MEDICAL CARE

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Eight states, from Florida to Washington, have recently changed their laws in an attempt to encourage private insurers to sell low-cost policies to working Americans who have no health coverage.
The new policies cost less because they provide less coverage and are exempt from laws that all states have requiring insurers to pay for various kinds of care. 
 At least 33 million Americans do not have health insurance, two-thirds of whom are workers or dependents. Insurers, worried about proposals for an insurance system run by the Government, say many owners of small businesses and people who are self-employed might pay for cheaper, less extensive plans.
 
Requirements Raise Costs
 Requirements for health-care coverage vary by state and now often include the services of chiropractors, therapy for alcohol and drug abuse or mental health problems and, in three states, acupuncture treatment. While such treatments can be enormously important to those who need them, they increase the cost of health plans.
The states hope that small employers and working people will buy the less-expensive plans, which cost as little as $60 a month for an individual, or about 25 percent to 40 percent less than policies with broader coverage.
Fewer uninsured patients would mean fewer unpaid bills, for which hospitals and doctors usually compensate by raising prices for other patients. Indeed, the main backer of the stripped-down health plans is the insurance industry, which is trying to placate large employers, who resent having to pay for uninsured patients.
The insurers are worried by the increasing support of employers and labor unions for more Federal regulation of health insurance, as well as for a system run by the Government, which could threaten the private insurance business.
 
Opponents Speak Out
 But the changes in state insurance laws are opposed by consumer advocates who favor national health insurance and those health-care professions whose services would not be paid for under the new insurance.
"Depending on how limited the package is, you can end up with health care being rationed for whole portions of the working population and their families," said Maryann O'Sullivan, executive director of Health Access, a California coalition that advocates a Government-financed health system.
Dr. Terry Rondberg, president of the World Chiropractic Alliance, a professional group, said chiropractors were considering bringing lawsuits challenging the new laws. "The costs that are driving up medical bills come from high technology, neo-natal care and drug rehabilitation programs, not chiropractic care," he said.
The eight states where new laws waiving some of the requirements have recently been enacted are Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington State. The idea is expected to catch on quickly elsewhere.
"Virtually every state is going to look at this approach in 1991," said Greg Scandlen, director of state research with the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, whose member groups provide coverage to 70 million people.
 
Still Too Costly for Some
 But it remains unclear how many uninsured people will end up obtaining coverage under the new laws. Many small employers and low-income individuals might find even these basic policies unaffordable, particularly because rising overall health costs might quickly wipe out any savings from the stripped-down insurance. The cost also makes it unlikely that the unemployed or those with part-time jobs would buy the policies, although they would be eligible to do so.
The number and kinds of required treatments vary widely by state. In states like Maryland, which requires coverage for 33 types of treatment, insurers say the requirements add 15 to 20 percent to the cost of premiums. In Florida, with 19 requirements, the cost and the potential saving is 5 percent to 7 percent, said Trevor Smith, the assistant state treasurer and assistant insurance commissioner.
Among the most costly requirements are those for treatment of drug abuse, which insurers are required to provide in 13 states, and mental health treatment usually including out-patient care, required in 11 states.
The waiver laws have been in effect only a few weeks in Virginia and Washington, and the six other states are still working on the change, so it is too early to tell what effect they might have.
The changes in Washington are typical of those in the other states. Washington now allows insurers to offer a lower-cost, lower-benefit plan to individuals and groups of fewer than 25 employees who do not have coverage. The new law is vague as to what treatments must be included in the basic coverage, but it says that the plan need not cover treatments like mental health care that the state requires for all larger employers who are not self-insured.
 
One Small Business's Plan
 Jim Weston, who owns Marty's Food Center in Puyallup, Wash., said he pays $226 a month to cover three employees under the new Blue Cross basic-coverage plan. Blue Cross will pay their covered medical expenses, after a $200 annual deductible for the two employees who are unmarried and a $600 deductible for the employee who has a family.
"If this hadn't come along, I doubt I would have been able to afford it," Mr. Weston said. "I pay the whole thing. The employees don't have a lot of bucks or they would have their own health insurance."
Nearly half the nation's uninsured employees work in businesses with fewer than 25 employees. Small businesses in Virginia had been paying $95 to $135 for each employee, on average.
Blue Cross groups say they are absorbing the costs of overhead, like paperwork, and hope to break even on medical costs in the new plans.
 
Differences in Virginia
 In Virginia, the law on basic coverage applies to groups of fewer than 50 who have been without coverage for at least 12 months. It requires that the plan cover 30 days of hospitalization a year, prenatal and obstetrical care and checkup visits to a doctor for children and adults. The Blue Cross version costs about $76 a month in Richmond for a person under age 40, with at least half being picked up by the employer.
The Edwards & Harding Petroleum Company, a gas exploration company with seven employees based in Abingdon in southwestern Virginia, was one of the first to sign up for the basic-coverage plan. "We were shopping around for insurance; we never had it," said Karen Edwards, a vice president of the company. "It fit us perfectly."
Ms. Edwards's company decided to have extra coverage for the care of healthy infants and for the maternity expenses of an employee's spouse. The monthly cost, half of which is paid by the employee, ranges from $60.55 for an unmarried employee under age 40 to $245.40 for an employee, 40 or older, with a family.
Insurers have been urging all state legislatures to waive the requirements and approve other changes to make health coverage more affordable. The 50 state insurance commissioners recommended last week that all states change their laws to slow the growth in rates that has forced many small employers out of the market.
"The problems of small groups are the No. 1 issue that the association needs to be working on," said Jim Long, the North Carolina insurance commissioner, who is the president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
 
'First-Priority Issue'
 John Sloan, president of the National Federation of Independent Business, an advocacy group in Washington for small businesses, said the cost of health insurance was also "the first-priority issue with our members." Among small employers, 40 percent do not provide health insurance.
Some experts say eliminating mandates is only one of a number of needed changes. "You need a comprehensive program that tries to deal with the problems of access to health insurance and cost together," said Alain Enthoven, a professor of political economy at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. He wants to limit Federal tax deductions on employee health benefits, while requiring all employers to pay for coverage, either directly for their employees or through new taxes to pay for the care of people who are not insured.
The insurance industry wants to keep the tax breaks but proposes state laws that would make coverage available to all small businesses regardless of the health of employees. "Getting rid of the mandates by itself is not enough to make coverage affordable to small employers," said Mr. Scandlen of Blue Cross.

Trying to Resurrect Shades of the Old South

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BURNSIDE, La.

 BODY:
The avenue of oaks leads from the bank of the Mississippi River to the white Doric columns of the Houmas House plantation, a shaded path through the history of battle and blood, dreams and dust at what was once Louisiana's largest sugar plantation.
But missing from this quintessential Southern scene of wealth derived from sugar cane and the sweat of 1,000 slaves is the curtain of Spanish moss that once draped these elegant trees in extravagant abundance. 
 All over Southern Louisiana, from the silent swamps of the Atchafalaya basin to the green marshes west of Lafayette, the plant that is a symbol of Southern pain and mystery has vanished from its former range.
"It used to hang off the oaks in folds," said Helene Crozat, the manager of the 160-year-old plantation house that is now a tourist stop 25 miles south of Baton Rouge. "Our landscape architect told me that leaded gasoline had an effect on it, and since we went to unleaded gas things were improving. It's hard to tell. There still isn't much moss here."
Although Spanish moss is not nearly as economically important as soybeans or sugar cane, and has been largely ignored by the plant research community, its decline in Louisiana has stirred years of popular speculation about the causes, most of it focused on air pollution. Scientists dispute this, citing a loss of habitat -- the oak trees on which the moss thrives -- and a destructive fungus.
Whatever the reasons, the loss of Spanish moss has compelled people to take unusual action to re-create its allure and re-establish the plant in some of its traditional habitats.
It is now common for movie directors shooting films in Louisiana's bayous to pay thousands of dollars to have boatmen collect moss from the deepest swamps where it still thrives and carefully hang it from cypress and oak. To establish the unsettling and obsessive mood of his 1987 film "Angel Heart," the director Alan Parker had to drape trees with harvested moss. "We go moss gathering for almost everything shot in Cajun country," said Tesa Laviolette, the director of the Louisiana Film Commission, which promotes movie making in the state.
Around the state, it has become routine to see homeowners gingerly tying or placing moss in their trees, hoping to establish new parental lines. Tree surgeons say they are often directed to save moss pulled from sick limbs and hang it on healthy ones. Along St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans, Louisiana's grandest boulevard where trees were once thick with Spanish moss, Allen and Marnie Borne completed the renovation of their historic home by gathering moss in Mississippi and Louisiana and paying two men to hang it in their 40-foot oak. Out back, the Bornes established an above-ground nursery by hanging moss in five crepe myrtle trees.
"We just liked the history of it, the quaintness of it," said Mrs. Borne. "It's the only tree on St. Charles Avenue that has moss. We put sprigs of it on our neighbor's tree, hoping it will catch on there too." The Bornes say it has.
It was not terribly long ago that Spanish moss was valued for more than its visual charms. Between 1900 and 1940, Spanish moss was ginned in Louisiana and other Deep South states into long dark fibers that felt like horsehair and had the strength of cotton cord. In 1936, the peak year of production, 10,000 tons of moss worth $2.5 million were ginned in the South and used to stuff upholstery and repair fishing nets.
Just one moss gin is left. In Labadieville, La., it turns out 100,000 pounds of material a year that fish hatcheries use to collect and preserve eggs from spawning females. Several other businesses in Louisiana collect Spanish moss from the swamps to sell to nurseries and flower shops, which use it to preserve moisture in potted plants and as a decorative bedding in floral arrangements.
 Despite the name, Spanish moss is neither moss nor Spanish. According to Howard William Rickett's authoritative study for the New York Botanical Garden, Tillandsia usneoides is a flowering plant and a member of the Bromeliaceae family, which makes it a distant cousin of the pineapple. Legend has it that Spanish moss (once called gray moss or Florida moss) acquired its name because someone thought it hung like "a Spanish beard."
Spanish moss is an epiphyte: it takes all its nutrition from the air. Botanists say Spanish moss prefers to dwell in live oaks because the craggy bark gives seeds a secure hold, and the long, stout limbs, which never lose their leaves, afford adult plants protection from wind and the drying effects of the sun.
Before the Civil War, Spanish moss was believed to harbor evil spirits and deadly diseases, especially malaria. The same kind of mythology has grown up in Louisiana to help explain the plant's declining ability to thrive in its traditional habitats.
Thousands of Louisiana residents point fingers at the toxic clouds of pollution from the state's mammoth chemical and oil plants. The first signs of the decline of Louisiana's Spanish moss in the mid-1970's coincided with the rapid industrialization of the bayous by the petrochemical industry. Residents who lived close to the new chemical plants also noticed that vegetables in their gardens were weakened by exposure to toxic chemicals and became susceptible to killing diseases.
But a more likely cause of the moss's retreat in Louisiana, say biologists, is Fusarium solani, a fungus that struck Florida, Georgia and South Carolina in the early 1970's. Moss in those states has since recovered.
In 1979, Dr. Ken Whitam, a plant pathologist at Louisiana State University, was summoned to the Tezcuco plantation, another antebellum home down the road from here, to take samples of sick and dying Spanish moss. After analyzing the samples in his laboratory, Dr. Whitam concluded that the fungus had finally reached Louisiana.
"Everybody wants to hear that air pollution is the problem," said Dr. Whitam. "I think that's so much hype. We're losing forest land that used to be this plant's prime habitat. We're losing some of our live oaks, probably from old age. We identified fusariam in moss in this state.
"You know," said Dr. Whitam, "it's been 10 years since we did this work, and I get more calls about Spanish moss than I've ever gotten about my work with soybeans."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC PULSE: Texas -- A special report;
Slow but Steady Revival After Going Bust in Texas

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Three years ago, with Texas mired in its worst post-World War II recession, Kim Dawson was not sure how long her modeling agency, the state's largest, could survive.
"A lot of good studios closed in 1987 and the photography work had just about dried up," she said, recalling the dreariest months of her career. 
 But like many Texans, Ms. Dawson now sees those days as part of the past. Thanks in part to the added business that came in when the J. C. Penney Company moved its headquarters from New York to the Dallas area, Ms. Dawson's agency is having one of its best years ever.
 
A Renewal of Optimism
 And for Christmas she and her husband are buying expensive art works for each other, something they have not done for a couple of years.
"I may be too optimistic," she said, "but I'd rather feel this way."
Ms. Dawson's optimism is emblematic of a tentative confidence that has emerged in the nation's third most populous state, with consumers' increased spending evident at car dealers, restaurants and department stores. Even the construction industry, which thrived in the oil boom of the early 1980's and sank to perilous depths as oil prices collapsed in the middle of the decade, is again hiring.
The state's recovery has been spotty but growing, aided largely by efforts of state officials and business leaders to diversify the economy. The energy industry now accounts for 10 percent of the state's economic activity, or half the level of a decade ago. The newly ascendant electronics and telecommunications industries, as well as a growing service and retail trade, have contributed to the recovery.
And although Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August has slowed the progress in recent months, many economists say the high oil prices and crumbling consumer confidence that threaten the nation's economy with recession are unlikely to drag Texas down, too. In fact, if oil prices remain high, the state would clearly benefit by next summer.
"We see Texas being one of the four or five strongest states over the next year in employment growth," said Clair Asklund, director of regional research at DRI/McGraw-Hill Inc., an economic research company in Lexington, Mass. "Right now, they have a cost advantage as a result of the hard times they went through in the middle 80's."
Bain & Company, the large corporate consulting firm based in Boston, opened an office in Dallas last month, choosing it over sites in New York and Chicago.
"Dallas was not even on our radar screen," said Mark A. Gottfredson, managing director of the new Dallas office. "But as we started to look around, it looked to us like the Texas economy would do extremely well over the next several years."
 
Help From Government
 Analysts cite several factors for Texas's relative strength in the face of a national recession. Beginning in 1987 the largest banks here, after years of staggering losses and reductions in lending, were bolstered by more than $7 billion in rescue money from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the federally managed fund for insuring deposits in banks. New owners, most from out of state, control eight of the state's nine largest banks.
The construction and real-estate industries, at a standstill since 1986, when the office-building boom collapsed, are showing slow improvement. Foreclosures and bankruptcies are down, too. Also, Texas, California and other border states stand to benefit more than other states if negotiations on a free-trade agreement between the United States and Mexico succeed.
"It's true that we are no longer insulated from the national economy, so we will be affected" if there is a national recession, said Michael Levy, publisher of Texas Monthly magazine. "But so much of what happens in a recession is psychological. The threat of a national recession is nothing to a state that has been through a depression."
Some bankers in the state see a mood of optimism. Timothy P. Hartman, chairman and chief executive of NCNB Texas, the state's largest bank, said his loan officers had noticed an increase in inquiries from owners of small businesses in the last three months.
"These are companies with sales in the $2 million to $10 million range, thinking about how they are going to attack the market in 1993 and '94," Mr. Hartman said. "That attitude was missing up until late August. The Texas economy has been at low tide for probably three years."
After lagging behind most other states in job growth the last five years, Texas has edged nearer to the top. The state added 110,000 jobs from September 1989 to September 1990, according to the Texas Comptroller's Office. The unemployment rate, averaging 6.2 percent for the year through November, seems certain to be the lowest since 1985.
The November figure jumped to 7 percent, from 5.7 percent in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Analysts said that manufacturing jobs declined in November, and that, unlike most years, retailers added few workers in anticipation of the Christmas season.
 
 The Oil Industry
A Shrinking Role, But Still Vital

Because Texas is far less dependent on the energy industry than a decade ago, the surge in oil prices that followed the invasion of Kuwait has not been an immediate boon, as it was in 1979 after the Islamic revolution in Iran.
This time around, higher oil prices have slowed job growth and rattled Texas consumers, said Harvey Rosenblum, senior vice president and head of economic research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. The health of the telecommunications, retailing and electronics industries that expanded or moved to Texas, like Compaq Computer in Houston and J. C. Penney, are more attuned to the nation's slowing economic pace than the weekly count of oil drilling rigs.
Yet if the price of oil remains above $25 a barrel, and the price of natural gas rises as well, Texas and other energy-producing states like Oklahoma and Louisiana would get a boost from the resulting increase in drilling. Oilmen said the increase would be apparent by the middle of next year.
While a sustained period of high oil prices would deepen a national recession, it would bolster the Southwest's economy.
The Federal Reserve in Dallas estimates that with every $1 increase in the price of oil over a year Texas gains 15,000 jobs while New York State loses 11,000 jobs, as the higher energy prices increase operating costs for businesses, especially manufacturers. The nation as a whole loses 78,000 jobs for every $1 increase, according to the Federal Reserve Bank.
Although many independent oil producers voiced skepticism about the current surge in prices, expecting them to fall as low as $20 a gallon once the Persian Gulf crisis passes, the large oil companies appear confident that the long-term trend is toward rising prices. In the last few weeks, several, like Shell Oil Company and Conoco Inc., have announced major increases for their 1991 spending plans, with most of the money designated for drilling additional wells.
More than half of the industry's spending on drilling last year went to projects outside the United States, but much of the drilling equipment is still made in Texas.
A large drilling-services company based in Dallas, the Halliburton Company, announced a 12 percent increase for its 1991 capital budget, to $442 million. Its chief executive, Thomas H. Cruikshank, said he anticipated rising demand for the company's products.
The number of active drilling rigs in the nation was 1,175 last week, compared with 1,062 a year ago, according to Baker-Hughes Inc.
 
 Signs of Revival
A Budget Surplus And Port Records

Several statistical barometers suggest how far the Texas economy has recovered in the last four years.
Apartment occupancy rates in Houston climbed above 90 percent this year for the first time since 1982 and in Dallas for the first time since 1984. The average monthly rent in Houston last spring was $372, as against $401 in 1982, according to M/PF Research Inc., a private research organization based in Dallas. Monthly rents in Dallas were an average of $459 in the three months that ended in September, as against $430 in the last quarter of 1984.
More than 500,000 new jobs have been created since the Texas economy hit bottom late in 1986. The Houston area added 197,000 jobs during the last four years, after losing 221,900 jobs in the previous five years, according to the Greater Houston Partnership, an economic development agency. The agency expects Houston to add 48,000 more jobs in 1991, mostly in the service sector.
The Texas state government completed the 1990 fiscal year, which ended in August, with a surplus of $767 million, a mirror image of the 1987 deficit of $745 million. Higher oil prices helped to increase tax receipts from oil production and increase money the state received from the mineral rights on vast expanses of state-owned land.
Total advertising published in The Houston Chronicle rose in 1989 for the third consecutive year, to 6.4 million inches. The high mark for the 1980's was 7.4 million inches in 1984.
The total tonnage of shipments through the Port of Houston set records of more than 120 million tons in each of the last two years, exceeding a record 117 million tons that had stood since 1979. The Port of Houston Authority has forecast another record for 1990, at 128 million tons. Rising shipments of imported oil, to refiners with storage tanks along the Houston Ship Channel, have been the biggest factor in the gains.
Since 1986, the amount of outstanding loans from banks has fallen 35 percent, prolonging the economic downturn. But that cutback in credit has apparently run its course. Mr. Rosenblum of the Federal Reserve Bank here said Texas bankers are getting over the shocking losses of 1987 and 1988.
"The banking industry has been about in neutral in terms of the credit it is providing the economy," he said. "It's about to head into first gear."
Moves into the Dallas area of the corporate headquarters of J. C. Penney and the Exxon Corporation, which completed its move last August, and the Southwest telephone operations of the GTE Corporation, have bolstered demand for legal and accounting firms as well as photography, advertising and temporary-employment agencies.
 
 Soft Spots
Feeling Ripples Of U.S. Downturn

Despite these gains, the Texas economy has weak spots, particularly in manufacturing and military activities that were hurt by budget cuts ordered by the Pentagon last summer. The General Dynamics Corporation, which makes the F-16 fighter and is Fort Worth's largest employer, has pared its payroll by 2,000, to 28,000, this year.
The largest employer in Dallas, Texas Instruments Inc., trimmed 1,000 jobs related to military output since last summer. Then, with sales slowing in the semiconductor industry, the company said last month that it would indefinitely freeze salaries for its white-collar workers.
The sharp drop in car sales nationwide in November reverberated in North Texas. The General Motors Corporation closed its plant in Arlington for four weeks, starting Dec. 2, after dealers slashed orders for the Cadillac Brougham and Chevrolet Caprice models assembled there.
High oil prices have also hurt petrochemical plants. The industry, which accounted for much of Houston's growth since 1986, has made little money in the last half of the year.
Then, too, the future for Texas real-estate values, and their effect on dozens of recapitalized, struggling savings institutions remains uncertain. The Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency that is handling sales of properties acquired from failed savings institutions, has had a trying time finding buyers for the thousands of properties it has here.
The state government also faces rising costs, in some cases ordered by Federal courts, of building more prisons and improving schools.
Texas is one of six states with no personal income tax. The state sales tax, at 6.25 percent, has been raised four times since 1983. Several business leaders have said the Legislature should adopt a personal income tax soon, but state officials realize it would be political suicide to propose such a measure. State Treasurer Ann Richards, who will become Governor in January, and the Republican she defeated in November, Clayton Williams, both said they would oppose a state income tax.
Governor-elect Richards said last week that she was confident the Texas economy would continue to grow in 1991, and that the state would not need to broaden the existing tax structure.
 
 Change in Thinking
Willing to Spend, But Cautiously

For now, old feelings about the relationship here between rising oil prices and rising prosperity are slow to die. Steady news reports over the last two months of oil prices near or above $30 a barrel have stirred hopes of better times.
Carl Sewell, a Cadillac and Lexus dealer here, said that Cadillac sales and leases soared in September and October and that he sold or leased every Lexus model that was shipped by its Japanese manufacturer, Toyota.
Mr. Sewell, whose cars sell for $30,000 and up, said many of his customers are cautious, choosing to lease rather than buy. Thirty percent of his current business is in leased vehicles, he said, as against 10 percent a year ago.
"Texans who survived to this point are much more careful with debt," he said, "and we are going to be much more careful with cash."
Texans make up about a third of the 2.5 million people who take some income from oil well production in the United States. Many inherited royalty rights acquired by grandparents who owned land in East Texas at the time of the oilfield boom there in the 1930's or in the Permian Basin fields of West Texas, where wildcatters and major drilling companies first appeared in the 1940's.
Most of the royalty checks had averaged less than $200 a month since oil prices fell from $27 a barrel in January 1986 to below $10 in the following June. But the surge in oil prices after the Iraqi invasion has revived a willingness to spend, although little of the extravagance that accompanied the early 80's boom is evident.
Since early September, more women have bought the $400 skirts and $300 designer jackets displayed in Susanne Stibolt's sportswear shop than at any other time since she opened the store two years ago in Highland Park, a wealthy enclave within Dallas.
Highland Park is populated by lawyers, financiers, oil barons and leaders of the arts, and Mrs. Stibolt said she believes that the higher oil prices explain the brisk business at her shop, Harrison Blair & Company. "It's obvious," she said. "Our clientele includes many people who have oil royalties, and the bigger royalty checks are coming in."
At the same time, most Texans doubt that oil prices will remain above $25 a barrel for long. Indeed, the more prevalent hope is that prices will not fall below $20 after the gulf crisis ends.
"No one is making any great plans based on the belief that oil prices will stay way up there," said Valerie Freeman, president and owner of Wordtemps, a local agency that places more than 1,000 temporary workers. "We're glad here in Texas that oil prices are going up. But we realize that this may not last another week."
A Dallas tax preparer and insurance saleswoman, Ann Whitchurch, said that in October her royalties on wells in the Panhandle produced the largest monthly royalties she had seen in years, $579.
"It was nice to have, but I've done nothing to celebrate, believe me," she said. She added that rising taxes had limited her income from the wells, each of which produce fewer than 10 barrels a day.
"I should get at least one more $500 check," she said, "but then it might go back to $200 a month. I can't depend on it."

HEADLINE: Soviet Drug Testing: Full Disclosure Is The Rule

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Pushing its new openness policy into sports, the Soviet Government has been freely disclosing suspensions and other sanctions against the nation's established athletes who have tested positive for use of forbidden drugs to gain competitive advantage.
"In the old days we would have simply said that athlete doping is alien to Soviet culture, but we live in the real world now," said Vasily V. Gromyko, deputy chairman of Goskomsport, the Soviet sports ministry, which was once notorious for its tight-lipped Cold War competitiveness. 
 Gromyko, a barrel-chested, 58-year-old former state wrestler who is the official Soviet authority on the subject of sports drug abuse, disclosed that 49 athletes had been sanctioned during the first 10 months of unannounced spot checking of athletes under a joint program with United States sports officials and physicians.
 
'Real Controls'
 The program features the sports equivalent of on-site inspection, the verification device at the heart of the burgeoning arms-control treaties between Moscow and Washington.
"Real controls like this are the only way to build trust," Gromyko said. "It is the same as in missile reduction: true trust begins when all secrets are revealed."
The agreement was signed last year, and in their first round of enforcement, Soviet officials have been quite candid, trying to use public disclosure as a caution to their international competitors, publicly disclosing the names of all 49 athletes who tested positive among the 2,500 spot-checked since the beginning of the year.
Offenders established by dual specimen analyses are already being suspended from competition and stripped of their medals, officials said. The offenders were accused of using anabolic steroids and psychotropic drugs illicitly.
 
Body Builders Cited
 Leafing through a computer printout of the drug-testing program, Gromyko said the worst offenders were in body building, an increasingly popular amateur sport here that greatly influences youth. Body builders accounted for 16 of the 49 offenders.
"That is a catastrophic situation," he said, noting those 16 cases turned up among a total of only 63 tests in that single category.
Of the rest, 11 track and field competitors tested positive among 600 whose specimens were analyzed; six weight lifters were found positive among 324 tested, and the rest, including two cyclists and two rowers, were scattered among other sports.
Individual competitors have the most pressure to experiment with drugs, Gromyko said. In five years at his present post, Gromyko said, he has not come upon a single case of drug abuse among Soviet team sports.
For the Soviet public, this new candor about the behavior of some individuals in the once-heroic category of sports celebrities is merely another bit of glasnost disclosure spurring more cynicism than hope amid the society's general discontent and preoccupation with economic survival. There has been virtually no reaction to the ministry's disclosures, with the public more wary than curious about the contradictions of individual enterprise, on the sports field or off.
 
Candor and Cynicism
 "My friends use anabolics, but I am categorically against them," said Nikolai Machkov, the coach of a body-building club here. "Parents are desperate for their kids to stay out of trouble and have something to do, so they are paying money now for the new body-building clubs."
As a historian at the new Lenin Museum in Gorki, Machkov can see firsthand the mix of increased candor and greater cynicism in Soviet life reflected in the sports drug disclosures. He finds that the doctored truths about Lenin are being gradually corrected just as the public is finding less reason to visit and study the archives of the fallen official idol.
"The nation must be told the truth," he said, speaking of the illicit sports drugs as much as Lenin. "For reasons of competitiveness, of course, but most importantly for reasons of good health."
Gromyko praised the cooperation of the Americans. He said that while the Soviet procedure includes unabashed disclosure of offenders, American custom is more discreet. But Soviet officials already receive confidential summaries of American findings that fully meet the standards of disclosure under the agreement, he said.
 
Off-Guard Athletes
 The Soviet ministry has been spot-checking its athletes at the rate of about nine a day at unannounced times and places and not just at competitive meets, he said, to find athletes least on their guard.
The first few exchanges of specialists with the United States have already occurred on an experimental basis to work out procedures. The program provides for physicians, laboratory specialists and training experts to visit the rival nation and conduct drug-ingestion tests at the rate, next year, of up to 100 athletes per country.
Individual competitors are to be of the visitors' choosing at times they secretly select as most promising, with test specimens to be made available within 24 hours of the request and analyzed by the visitors under ideal laboratory conditions, Gromyko said.
"Any time of the year, day or night," he said. "We need the element of surprise." He estimated that anything more than 24 hours' notice to an athlete or coach worked against effective testing.

San Diego Seeking Little Cup

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD

 BODY:
As if having the America's Cup isn't enough, government officials in the San Diego area are going after the Little America's Cup. The trophy has some of the same history as its illustrious namesake. In 1985, the Little America's Cup was lost by United States yachtsmen to Australia and the Australians have successfully defended it twice. This month, San Diego sailors will try to win it back.
The Little America's Cup was established in 1961 by the Sea Cliff Yacht Club of Long Island. Known as the International Catamaran Challenge Trophy, the award of small silver sails isn't as prestigious as the gilded urn of the America's Cup. But the multihull racing it fosters attracts yachting's most advanced designers. 
 Gino Morelli, the multihull designer who was instrumental in creating Dennis Conner's Stars & Stripes catamaran in 1988, has designed a twin-hulled sailboat for the Little America's Cup. The 25-foot catamaran has been sent from San Diego to Melbourne, Australia, where it is expected to begin racing next Sunday.
The effort is the brainchild of Brian Bilbray, the San Diego County Supervisor. Bilbray, a multihull sailor, has been closely involved as a county official with plans for the 1992 America's Cup series in San Diego. With the international event stalled in the New York courts for two years, Bilbray embraced the idea of the Little America's Cup as an interim challenge.
 
Playing Waiting Game
 "It was a waiting game," Jeff Stafford, Bilbray's administrative assistant, said of the court impasse. At stake was whether Michael Fay of New Zealand would be awarded the America's Cup for New Zealand, or whether it would go to San Diego. San Diego officials at the time estimated that the event could bring the area as much as $1 billion in revenue. Bilbray argued that the Little America's Cup also had economic potential.
Bilbray persuaded local governments to support a Little America's Cup campaign. If San Diego sailors won the catamaran trophy, it would bring another sailing event to the area, he said. "It is a perfect way to highlight the South Bay as a sailing center and tourist spot," Stafford said.
As the syndicate chairman, Bilbray enlisted the Chula Vista Yacht Club, a club south of San Diego, as a sponsor. He raised $85,000 in support from local municipalities along the South Bay waterfront: Chula Vista, National City, Coronado and Imperial Beach. Another $100,000 came from the Port of San Diego, a state government agency that has committed $8.3 million for the 1992 America's Cup match series.
The local communities raised the money from hotel taxes, a levy designed to further enhance tourism, said Stafford. For the area to reap the cup's benefits, the San Diego team needed to bring the Little America's Cup trophy back from Australia.
An overall budget of $750,000, which also includes corporate and private donations, includes about $160,000 for building Freedom's Wing, the San Diego syndicate's new high-tech boat.
 
Two-Man Crew
 The catamaran, capable of speeds up to 30 knots, has a crew of two Californians: Pete Melvin of Westminster, and Steve Rosenberg of Long Beach, who were former teammates on the ProSail professional multihull circuit. They will begin racing next week against another challenger, a catamaran from La Rochelle, France. The winner of a four-of-seven race series is slated to compete against the Australian defender beginning Jan. 12.
"I think if we get through the French with our noses clean, that will give us the experience we need to race the Australians," Morelli said last week. "We'll have three weeks in Melbourne to get ready for them."
The boats they are racing are C Class catamarans. The multihulls have few design limits: a length of 25 feet; a width of 14 feet, 300 square feet of sail area; and a two-man crew. Yacht designers strive to build the lightest boats to gain a speed advantage. Morelli said his team's design weighs about 400 pounds.
Experience has shown in the Little America's Cup that getting to the starting line is as important as winning the race. In the last event, staged in Melbourne in the winter of 1989, a challenger from the Cabrillo Yacht Club of San Pedro, Calif., was on site but unable to race. The lightweight but fragile catamaran capsized and its rig fell apart during the starting sequence of the match-racing series.

Scranton Baseball Is No Minor Issue

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH

DATELINE: SCRANTON , Pa.

 BODY:
IN a city where steel furnaces and rail cars loaded with coal are all but a distant memory, there stands an elegant monument to a long-lost industrial and manufacturing era.
The Royce Hotel in downtown Scranton is built on what was once one of the busiest railway hubs in the region, the Lackawanna Station. 
 The stately six-story building now has only railroad memorabilia to provide a reminder of what was a viable artery from which the Lackawanna, Delaware and Western carried the region's precious resources to cities like Hoboken, N.J., and Buffalo.
Scranton, Wilkes-Barre and the surrounding mountain and valley towns of northeastern Pennsylvania long ago stopped producing coal and steel. Local residents stubbornly refuse to allow an image held by much of the outside world -- that it is a Rust Belt region -- to take hold.
Gains, economic and social, large and small, are held dearly. No better example exists, residents say, than two modern-day products: the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, the Triple A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies; and the ball park that houses the team, Lackawanna County Stadium.
"The Red Barons and the ball park are probably one of the most significant economic developments for our local economy in years," said Charlie Gahwiler, a local Scranton businessman and one of the original season ticket holders for Red Barons games.
The Red Barons' primary function is to produce major leaguers for the parent club about two and a half hours to the south. As for the two- years-young 10,600-seat multipurpose ballpark, it is a miniature version of the Phillies' Veterans Stadium, and what it produces cannot be easily measured.
"The stadium was definitely a morale builder for an area that has been through some tough economic times recently," said Pat McKenna, editorial page editor of The Scranton Times-Tribune. Take away that the team and with it the ball park's revenues and it would have "an incredibly chilling effect."
Such words are not the mutterings of a doomsayer, but the very real concern of a lot of people in this region as well as of the close to 200 minor league towns across the United States, Canada, the Dominican Republic and Mexico. Not until next Thursday can such concerns go away. That's when minor league officials will vote on a new Professional Baseball Agreement that would bind them to their major league affiliates. Without the agreement, many clubs may be permanently disenfranchised.
Chances seem likely that the two groups will come to a formal agreement. The executive committee of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues -- the minors' governing board -- unanimously recommended Friday that its membership approve a proposal already ratified by the major league owners. Still, the very idea that minor league baseball might have been wrenched away proved to be very sobering, especially for a region like Scranton/Wilkes- Barre.
Even though the Barons are still contractually bound to the Phillies for another year, they have no formal schedule because of the four-and-a-half-month dispute. The Barons don't even know which teams will be in what had been an eight-club Triple A International League. "There is some concern because this is more than baseball here," Bill Terlecky, the general manager of the Barons, said.
"Coal has been gone for about 30 years," said McKenna. "The downtown area of Scranton, once a retail center, is not in great shape. The ball park, however, generates money. According to the Economic Development Council of Northeastern Pennsylvania, for every dollar spent at Lackawanna Stadium, another $7 is generated for the local economy."
Studies indicate that $69-73 million worth of economic impact would be attributed to the development of the stadium over a 10-year period if the Barons average a quarter of a million fans annually. In the team's first two seasons, the attendance has averaged 500,000.
"The ball park is a catalyst," said Bill Risse, director of community affairs for the county. "It wasn't part of a master plan. but one of a succession of developments, all interdependent on one another. They've given the community a lot of momentum."
The ball park is nestled at the foot of Montage Mountain in Moosic, just south of Scranton and about 18 miles north of Luzerne County's Wilkes-Barre. A ski resort, constructed in the early 1980's, is atop the mountain. A business park that has already attracted J.C. Penney and Prudential is springing up around the base.
The area's momentum now may hinge on Thursday's vote. "If things don't go, then I think you'll see a backlash," Terlecky said.
He is not just talking about the ire of the 14 full-time Barons employees or even the 200 or so part-time concessionaires, parking lot attendants and ushers. Rather, the backlash would be broad-based. For Lackawanna County Stadium, as the name suggests, is a public facility, owned and operated by the county's multipurpose stadium authority.
The county, using bonds and state grants, built the park at a cost of $22 million and started operations with a $13 million debt service to be paid in increments of $1.8 million a year for 20 years. The park primarily depends on the Barons' tickets sales to meet that debt. "In the first season, we hit debt service and we look to be on track this year," said Terlecky.
If ticket sales can't cover that expense, the taxpayers will have to, a fact not lost on politicians. Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, concerned about all five minor league teams in Pennsylvania, had asked the Senate Judiciary Committee to consider holding special hearings. And, said Joe Corcoran, a Lackawanna County commissioner, "we were committed to going to war over this, to the courts, if necessary."
Still, while Terlecky and others wait on Thursday's vote, the general manager said the team was trying to concentrate on the job at hand. Season ticket sales, the backbone of the team ever since 2,200 buyers guaranteed a financial base for the team in 1984, are still brisk. Terlecky expects the usual 4,000 purchasers again for 1991.
"Nobody," said Terlecky, "has turned away."

Free-Agent Signings in the Game of Catch-the-Leader

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
A year ago some of the teams that had watched the Oakland Athletics win their second successive American League West championship took expensive steps to try to reduce the distance between the champions and them.
The Kansas City Royals signed Mark Davis, a Cy Young award-winning relief pitcher, and Storm Davis, a starting pitcher, giving them what they believed was the best staff in the league. The California Angels signed Mark Langston, figuring he would solve the missing link in their pitching. The Seattle Mariners made an unusually bold foray into the free-agent market by signing the first baseman Pete O'Brien. 
 Oakland, however, won again, and the Angels, the Mariners and the Royals finished fourth, fifth and sixth, winding up an aggregate 76 1/2 games behind the Athletics. So much for the aggressive winter moves.
Now come the clubs that finished behind the Cincinnati Reds in the National League West. This is their winter to act aggressively in an effort to succeed the Reds. No matter how much they spend, though, or how much creative trading they do, only one team can win the division championship. And there's no guarantee that any of the aggressive also-rans will catch the Reds.
The Los Angeles Dodgers began the can-you-top-this approach by signing Darryl Strawberry, but the San Francisco Giants leaped in with a frenzy, signing three free agents for a total of $33 million and making two trades.
The division's two new general managers have not deferred to those already in residence. In fact, they made similar acquisitions but in different ways. John Schuerholz, assuming command of the last-place Atlanta Braves, quickly recruited half of a new infield: Sid Bream for first base and Terry Pendleton for third.
Then Joe McIlvaine changed half of the San Diego Padres' infield, obtaining Fred McGriff for first base and Tony Fernandez for shortstop in a trade that caught the attention of everyone and the envy of many other general managers.
McIlvaine is not finished; he seeks another center fielder, perhaps Brett Butler, who is a free-look free agent. But the Braves and the Dodgers like Butler, too, creating what could be an economically spiraling competition. The outcome of the pursuit, if the winner is one of the N.L. West teams, could have an impact on the division race. It could even affect the Giants, who signed Willie McGee and shed Butler.
Most likely Al Rosen, the Giants' general manager, isn't finished bolstering his team's chances either. If he could add another left-handed pitcher -- he has already signed two, Bud Black and Dave Righetti -- the Giants would be even better equipped to neutralize the predominantly left-hand-hitting Dodgers, whom they see as a formidable rival, perhaps even more so than the Reds. (The Dodgers also have signed a starting pitcher, Kevin Gross.)
The defending champions have not added any new players to their winning collection. They lost one, Danny Jackson, as a free agent, but once that left-handed pitcher left, they made sure that another one, Tom Browning, didn't get away.
The Houston Astros have not made any moves. They are debating whether to trade Glenn Davis, their first baseman, who could be a free agent after next season, instead of signing him to a very expensive contract.
If they do trade him, though, they will not keep him in the division. It is well stocked with first basemen, people such as McGriff, Will Clark and Eddie Murray.
 
Jays' Offense a Question Mark
 With two trades and two free-agent signings, Pat Gillick has made nearly as many moves as he had in the previous three and a third years as the Toronto general manager. As interesting as the trades are, however, Gillick has taken a chance on leaving the Blue Jays with too little offense.
Compare the 1990 figures for total bases and on-base percentage of the four stars in the stunning swap with the Padres.
Fred McGriff and Tony Fernandez had a combined 543 total bases to 471 for Joe Carter and Roberto Alomar and a .375 on-base percentage to .314. Unlike such statistics as runs batted in and runs scored, these are individual achievements that have no reliance on other hitters.
Gillick said that the Blue Jays could afford to carry the inexplicably weak bat of Devon White, their new center fielder, but even if the two-for-two were viewed as an even exchange, adding White and subtracting George Bell would leave the Blue Jays short on offense.
 
Rebuilding Time for the Cardinals
 The St. Louis Cardinals have played a bad joke on Joe Torre. Last year, after Whitey Herzog realized the direction the team was heading and quit as manager, the Cardinals lured Torre out of a comfortable broadcasting booth. The dugout doesn't figure to be too comfortable next season.
The Cardinals, who won three division titles in six years in the 80's, are in a state of fatal deterioration. They finished in last place this year, and from that team they have lost Vince Coleman, Terry Pendleton and Ken Dayley as free agents afer trading Willie McGee before he could leave as a free agent. They also will be without John Tudor, their No. 1 pitcher with 12 victories. This is a team in need of serious rebuilding.
The Cardinals are counting on youth for respectability: four players who have a total of three years and 69 days of of major league experience. They are the outfielders Bernard Gilkey, Ray Lankford and Felix Jose and the catcher-turned-third baseman, Todd Zeile.
Gilkey will replace Coleman in left field (although Milt Thompson will be there to platoon if necessary) and Lankford will continue to play center, where he replaced McGee. Jose, acquired from Oakland during the season, will play right.
Zeile, a disappointment offensively as a rookie catcher, will take Pendleton's place at third, where he played for about a month late in the season, then in the instructional league. Tom Pagnozzi moves in as the catcher. Dayley's departure leaves Frank DiPino as the No. 1 left-hander in the bullpen.
If Torre can take the frustration and the headaches he undoubtedly will encounter, someday he could have a good young team. By losing Coleman, Pendleton and Dayley, the Cardinals will have five extra selections early in next June's amateur draft, giving them seven of the first 40 to 45 players chosen.
 
The Patience of Quinn
 On the day he was named baseball executive of the year by The Sporting News, Bob Quinn, the general manager of the World Series champion Cincinnati Reds, talked about the importance of patience in his job and how his previous employer, George Steinbrenner, never understood that.
Unlike the impetuous Steinbrenner, Quinn said, he took his time making deals, checking reports, consulting with scouts, even calling former coaches of the team he was dealing with to learn more about the player he sought.
The next day Quinn contradicted himself, and maybe lost a starting pitcher in the process.
Quinn, a low-key man who occasionally flashes a temper, lashed out at Zane Smith's agent, Joe Sroba, even slamming down the telephone to end their conversation. Then he harshly criticized him publicly, saying Sroba had told him if he offered $10.5 million for Smith they had a deal.
However, as Sroba explained before and after Quinn's tirade and as three other general managers apparently understood, $10.5 million was the minimum offer needed to remain in competition. How the misunderstanding developed is not the point. By reacting heatedly instead of trying to straighten out their differences, Quinn belied his policy of patience.
As for Steinbrenner, he blames Commissioner Fay Vincent for the Yankees' loss of Dave Righetti. "If I were involved, this never would have happened," the ousted managing partner said, again arguing that he should have been permitted to deal with free agents.
Steinbrenner, however, was free to deal with Righetti before he resigned Aug. 20. He knew Righetti was in the last year of his contract. He could have locked him up before the season or before he was locked out.
One of the points Righetti made the night he agreed to take his heart to San Francisco was that the Yankees didn't talk to him all season about a new contract. If Steinbrenner wanted Righetti back so badly, he could have talked to him and negotiated a deal long before the reliever was in a position to get away.
 
 Exhibit No. 1, Collusion 5?
 In a farewell speech to his fellow owners, Charles Bronfman of the Montreal Expos decried the profusion of lucrative multiyear contracts and cited the MacPhail report that five years ago expressed much the same lament, with statistics added for support. Bronfman's mention of the report served as the proverbial red flag waved in front of a bull because it was one of the early pieces of evidence the players presented to support their collusion case.
"We hope it doesn't become the first exhibit in collusion five," said Donald Fehr, head of the players' union. "Obviously, if he cites the MacPhail report, it has potential to put people on edge because that was the event that confirmed that collusion had begun to take place. I don't expect there to be further collusion. If there is, sparked by this suggestion or any other, somebody should remember that there are triple damage provisions in the new agreement."

Europeans Begin to Calculate the Price of Pollution

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS

DATELINE: THE HAGUE

 BODY:
IN a Spartan office on the eighth floor of the Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics, a shy man with the stoop of a bookkeeper rather than the bearing of a firebrand has been quietly plotting a revolution in the way economists look at the environment.
For 30 years, Roefie Hueting has provoked and prodded planners and policymakers, telling them that they are fooling themselves in the way they measure a country's wealth, the welfare of its citizens, the prices of goods and services. And he has devised his own way, a set of new indicators that would arrive at a "green" gross national product, accounting for the harm that economic activity does to the environment. 
 The idea is getting a broader reception in Europe as the environmental debate has heated up, and public opinion now favors more drastic steps to fight pollution.
By ignoring or disguising the cost of economic production to the environment, Mr. Hueting and other dissident economists argue, the gross national product of many countries has been inflated and sometimes grossly distorted. It is absurd, Mr. Hueting contends, that measures to defend nature or to check or clean damage have been tallied as growth.
In his years as a gadfly, the meticulous and persistent Mr. Hueting, economist and jazz pianist, has been an irritant to people on the left and the right. He survived politicians who wanted to close down his department, and he got a reputation as a Don Quixote among economists. Slowly he gained acclaim from his peers. Now governments and international institutions are listening.
The Dutch Government has asked Mr. Hueting to produce an alternative system of national accounting to reflect the damage done to the air, water, soil, and animal and plant life, and to account for the cost of maintaining or restoring them. Planners at the United Nations Environment Program and officials at the World Bank have said that Mr. Hueting's publications got them thinking about the need for "environmental accounting" in recent years.
Mr. Hueting is far from the only economist contending that the habits of more than 50 years of economic accounting -- using the output of goods and services as the only measure of economic and even social success -- are outdated and misleading. Arguments that new rules and premises are needed have gained among researchers in the United States. A bill passed a year ago by Congress directed the Commerce Department to work on a new system of calculating environmental costs and benefits.
In Europe, the idea of "green" accounting has pried its way into more and more government offices. Sweden' Parliament has sent a delegation to the Netherlands for advice on starting a project. France and Norway have started to compile inventories of their natural resources, a first step to linking the state of the environment to economic activity.
Germany, which is farther along, has responded to pressure from its Green Party and is working out a system to correct the "double counting" in its national bookkeeping. In a 1989 study, the economist Christian Leipert showed that between 1970 and 1985, West Germany's spending to preserve or restore nature increased from 5 percent to 10 percent of its gross national product, and was consistently counted as growth. That meant, said Mr. Hueting, that measures simply to check deterioration were recorded as a significant contribution.
"Take a water treatment plant," said Mr. Hueting. "Under the present accounting system, it is booked as a contribution, though it should be entered as cost. It's built to make up for the loss of usable water. It does not generate growth. You can only count that plant as value added if you have first entered the ruined drinking water as a loss." It would be equally misleading to count cleaning smog as growth, he said.
 
Not a Solution
 Redefining such costs and correcting the books is useful, he said , but "it's dangerous if politicians or statisticians present this as the solution, because, as is well known, most environmental destruction is never restored or compensated."
Ultimately, Mr. Hueting and other ecological economists hope that a new framework for national accounts will lead to a fundamental change of national goals and even a redefinition of progress. "Green" accounting will show how far the world has drifted from rational behavior, from activities that are not destructive to the biosphere and therefore to society, they argue.
Applying a "green" G.N.P., Mr. Hueting said, will make polluting products more expensive and consequently will slow growth. But he said this does not have to mean a decline in employment. "Many activities that protect the environment will have to be more labor-intensive," he said. "An economy that protects the environment will create more jobs."
While he says his work is often complex and frustrating, the political climate for his ideas is far more favorable than in the early 1960's. Mr. Hueting and his team of 30 specialists, among them biologists, chemists and physicists, reckon that they need at least two years to come up with a draft for a "green" G.N.P. Even so, the Netherlands seems further along than most nations. The Department for Environmental Statistics, created by Mr. Hueting in 1969, has been collecting data on the environment -- all emissions, concentrations of toxic material, disappearances of plant and animal species and other changes -- over the last two decades. Such an inventory, he said, is a vital prerequisite.The process, he said, involves establishing norms for "sustainable use" of the environment, that is, leaving intact its capacity to regenerate itself.
 
Complex Process
 The next step, he said, is to decide what measures are needed to attain sustainable use. The costs of these measures must then be subtracted from the current G.N.P. to calculate the "green" G.N.P. "It is obviously a very complex process," said Mr. Hueting, "despite the fact that we can apply traditional economic methods."
<> <> Even if governments only use it as a parallel system, he said, it will help to clarify "our mistaken accounting and demonstrate how we are squandering air, water, ground, trees, spaces, silence, as if they were free goods instead of assets that we are losing." It will clarify "that we should abandon the G.N.P. as the main indicator of economic success and not get upset when it drops."
While many researchers in Europe have agreed that income is not a satisfactory measure of quality of life here, they say a new perspective is even more important for developing nations that are in danger of squandering their assets. Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, which have cut their forests and suffered soil erosion, have asked the Netherlands for technical assistance in environmental accounting. At the United Nations, the Statistical Commission is now revising its System of National Accounts, which it does only once every two decades, and it has agreed to set up guidelines for countries that want to draw up their own "green" G.N.P.'s.

Miami Melting Pot Proves Explosive

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
WITH its periodic civil disruptions, this has become the Old Faithful of American cities. Last week, the latest eruption of looting, mayhem and hatred raised the question of just what it is about this sun-splashed city that begets such uprisings.
Five times in the last 10 years, Miami has been rocked by disorders. While other cities mark the passage of time by elections, natural disasters, or championships won by local sports teams, Miami's calendar is pockmarked by riots named after the neighborhoods where they have occurred: Overtown, Liberty City and, last week, Wynwood. 
 Indeed, the worst of the disturbances is recalled in eerily human terms. The 1980 conflagration that left 18 dead, 400 injured and $100 million in property damage in the predominantly black Liberty City district is simply referred to as "McDuffie," after the black motorcyclist whose death at the hands of the police touched off the rampage.
Compared to McDuffie, the three-hour spree of arson and looting in the largely Puerto Rican neighborhood of Wynwood was a pint-sized affair. Three buildings were set ablaze, and only a handful of others were damaged. And except for two newspaper photographers who were roughed up by youths in the streets, no one was injured.
"What happened this week was, in terms of disturbances of this kind, rather small," said Msgr. Bryan Walsh, director of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Miami. "Bigger ones have occurred after soccer games in England."
But if Wynwood's explosion was smaller than McDuffie's, the two were fueled by similar discontents. In each case, rioting followed the accquittal of police officers charged with a killing. In Wynwood, the dead man was 35-year-old Leonardo Mercado, a suspected drug dealer. As in McDuffie, the scene was a neighborhood plagued by poverty, crime, gang activity and drugs. And, once again, police were unprepared for a community's reaction. In each case, spokesmen for a disaffected group complained of being ignored by the city's political and commercial elite.
"We're the invisible community," said Betzaida Ferrer, state director for National Puerto Rican Forum. "And it's sad that this is the only way we have gotten recognition." Xavier Suarez, Miami's Mayor, acknowledged after the disturbance that the problems of the Wynwood area were not being met. He promised to divert more city resources to the area.
Miami's Puerto Ricans, comprising about 4 percent of the population, were not known for such eruptions of mass anger. For that reason, police failed to place their riot squads on alert after the Mercado verdict. But Miami's Puerto Ricans say they are thought of as meek only when they are thought of at all, which is seldom.
"The perception here is that when you speak about Hispanics, you only speak about Cubans," said Emilio Lopez, president of the Borinquen Health Care Center in Wynwood. "When you speak about the poor, you speak about blacks."
Expressions of resentment against the entrepreneurial and politically conservative Cubans, who make up 42 percent of the city's population, were common among the youths on Wynwood streets during the disturbance. In Miami's black neighborhoods, it is also commonly complained that Cubans have gotten more than their share of economic advantages.
"There is a perception among blacks of loss of jobs as a result of the Latinization of the city," said Marvin Dunn, professor of community psychology at Florida International University. Mr. Dunn said that census data have not supported this contention. In fact, he said, black incomes rose significantly during the 1970's, the time when the Cubans were becoming entrenched in Miami. Mr. Dunn and others are awaiting the 1990 census data to see if that trend continued during the 1980's. Still, he says, the "why" of Miami's propensity for civil disturbance remains "a perplexing question."
What is undeniable, though, is Cuban domination of the city's politics. Three of the five members of the Miami City Commission, including the mayor, are of Cuban descent. So are the city manager, the Dade County school superintendent and one of one of the city's four members of the House of Representatives. Blacks, who account for about 25 percent of the population, have one seat on the City Commission
"The political agenda in Miami clearly places the interest and priorities of Cubans first," said Mr. Dunn.
In fact, both the Wynwood disturbance and the McDuffie riot occurred while the city's attention was diverted by events relating to the Cuban community. In 1980 it was the Mariel boatlift. Last week it was a bitter debate between blacks and Cuban politicians who withdrew the city's official welcoming praise of Nelson Mandela last June after Mr. Mandela spoke highly of Fidel Castro.
Perhaps the simplest explanation is that there are riots in Miami because there have been riots in Miami. In a close succession of disorders, the memory of the last rampage can serve as motivation for the next, especially when local officials view social and economic conditions as contributory factors and respond with more money for remedial programs.
"The other people, the black people, this is how they did it, and it worked," Yvette Diaz, 17 years old, told the Associated Press during the riot.
"People in society follow patterns," said Maurice Ferre, Miami's former mayor, who is also Puerto Rican. "Obviously a pattern has been established that when you have been ignored, you respond with civil disturbances."

Are Special Tolls A Way to Thin Out Midtown Traffic?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
THE pleasures of New York City's rush-hour traffic are well known. But to some environmentalists and economists, Manhattan's street snarl is seen as an opportunity as well as a problem. New technology already being used to collect tolls in Texas and Louisiana could be adopted, they say, to limit the number of rush-hour drivers in Manhattan by charging a fee, with results that could help to restore New York City's edge in the national competition for jobs and tax base.
Others, notably New York City's Transportation Commissioner, point out that such restrictions have so far been adopted only in authoritarian Singapore, and argue that such a system would never be accepted in Manhattan. But the idea had enthusiastic backers in the Koch Administration, and pressures from Washington could yet make the concept attractive to Mayor David N. Dinkins. 
 Tough standards adopted in the new Clean Air Act will eventually force New York to take dramatic steps to cut pollution from cars. And new technology for assessing "congestion fees" at rush hour, some believe, would make it practical to meet the air-quality targets with little disruption to commerce, clipping the daily peaks in traffic while actually increasing the total number of vehicles able to use midtown streets.
The potential benefits are so great, advocates such as William Vickrey, an economist at Columbia University, argue, that even rush-hour drivers would be better off: the savings in time would more than offset the fees. But even the most ardent supporters concede that congestion fees will not be workable unless commuters are convinced the fees are more than just another way to separate them from their money.
Each day some three-quarters of a million vehicles inch into the area bounded by Second and Tenth Avenues, 34th and 59th Streets. Once inside, traffic moves like ketchup in a television commercial: speeds average 7 miles an hour daily.
 
More Cars, Less Road

 
 To Gabriel Roth, a former World Bank economist who is an advocate of congestion fees, that makes no more sense than the Soviet practice of deciding who gets the limited supply of sausage by rewarding those who wait longest in lines outside butcher shops. Indeed, it apparently makes less sense: no matter how long the line, the amount of meat available remains the same. But very heavy use reduces a road system's capacity.
As traffic builds, average speed falls -- and the number of vehicle miles traveled each hour eventually falls with it. As average travel time increases, the total number of vehicles that can squeeze through the streets diminishes.
Most vehicles entering Manhattan do pay tolls for the privilege. But as George Haikalis, a New York transportation consultant, notes, commuters perversely receive discounts for regular rush hour use of bridges and tunnels. A 1986 study prepared for the city by Cambridge Systematics, a Massachusetts consulting firm, envisaged a system with more rational incentives: cars entering midtown on weekday mornings would have to display a special license, purchased on a daily, monthly or annual basis.
Such a system has been in use in Singapore since 1975. The daily fee, now about $5, cuts morning traffic by 60 percent. New Yorkers would probably be less responsive: the 1986 study estimates that a $5 fee would cut private auto entries during the morning by a fifth.
Since many of the entry points to midtown are streets rather than bridges or tunnels, toll collection might have proved an expensive headache in the mid-1980's. But electronic collection systems have improved the prospects for unintrusive administration.
Radio-based identification sys-tems built by the Amtech Corporation are used to collect tolls on the North Dallas Tollway and the Crescent City Bridge in New Orleans; by next year an Amtech system will cover the Oklahoma Turnpike. A British system was fully tested in downtown Hong Kong. And Singapore is now converting to electronic collection.
Equipment above or below the road identifies each vehicle by its radio signature, broadcast by a cigarette-pack-sized transmitter in the windshield. Individual accounts are billed with statements that look like phone bills. In Dallas, drivers pay $30 for the identification unit; all other costs are covered with a 5-cent-a-transaction charge. Those driving infrequently in midtown Manhattan could buy one-day stickers, sold at bridge crossings and gas stations.
Hong Kong's system was judged 99.7 percent accurate in a two-year test of some 3,000 vehicles. Amtech equipment used to keep track of tolls on buses entering New York's Lincoln Tunnel is 99.99 percent accurate. It might still be prudent, though, to test the system under battlefield conditions -- say, by trying electronic collection on one of the Hudson River crossings.
 
A Wall of Resistance

 
 But the politics of congestion fees are far more problematic than the technology or economics. Sandford Borins, a political scientist at York University in Ontario, notes that the Hong Kong system was stillborn because drivers viewed it as a backhanded tax. New York's own flirtation with congestion fees offers little reason for optimism.
Ross Sandler, Mayor Koch's Commissioner of Transportation, proposed a fee in 1986 as a way of meeting looming Federal air-quality deadlines. The concept was supported by the Regional Plan Association, a private research group, but ran into a wall of resistance from unions and midtown businesses.
Such opposition frustrates Mr. Vickrey. The small minority of shoppers who drive to midtown, he believes, would happily pay a modest fee in return for an easier ride. And even a modest improvement in traffic that increased the efficiency of delivery trucks would more than offset the charge. But Lucius Riccio, New York's current Commissioner of Transportation, is not convinced. "To affect people's driving behavior," he said, "you would have to charge $10. And at that point you would be restricting certain groups."
One way to make the idea more appealing might be to link the peak-hour congestion fees to a dollar-for-dollar reduction of bridge and tunnel tolls at non-peak hours. Another, advocated by Mr. Haikalis, would be to dedicate the revenues to road and mass-transit improvements. Mr. Haikalis would also use some of the revenue to allow free bus-subway transfers, sharply reducing the costs of subway commuting for car-minded residents of the outer boroughs.
Those revenues could be substantial. If 120,000 vehicles entered midtown during the weekday morning rush (20 percent fewer than now) a $5 tax would generate more than $150 million annually.
Congestion fees would be a hard political sell without support from city and state officials. But the traffic problem has not induced a radical response from City Hall in the past, and there is no sign it will in the future. What eventually might force action, though, is a hard line from environmental regulators.
Amendments to the Clean Air Act will require the metropolitan area to reduce overall emissions of pollutants by 3 percent annually, a goal that Eric A. Goldstein at the Natural Resources Defense Council argues will put New York "under increasing pressure to formally address motor vehicle pollution." And if Federal sanctions -- everything from the loss of subsidies to a ban on construction -- became a credible threat, the politics of congestion fees could change.

In South America, Bush Finds Warmth And Restiveness

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
MILITARY revolts in Argentina and Panama, an army massacre of Indians in Guatemala, a major rebel offensive in El Salvador and the murder of a Coca-Cola executive by guerrillas in Bolivia made it an inauspicious week for President Bush to tour Latin America.
The violence was not related to Mr. Bush's visit -- except for a scattering of rioting and minor bombings in Venezuela and Chile -- and it did not spoil the general warmth of his welcome. But the outbursts highlighted the intractable obstacles of militarism, racism, poverty, corruption and ideological polarization that stand in the way of the economic progress Mr. Bush intended to promote. 
 They also served to raise the question of whether any United States President, whatever his ideology, economic program or personal style, can put together a policy that will help heal Latin America's wounds. Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy were beloved in Latin America for the idealism they expressed in pursuing the Good Neighbor Policy and the Alliance for Progress. But whatever successes their programs accomplished did not endure.
George Bush is also popular in Latin America, uncommonly so for a Republican President, and he has proclaimed his own Enterprise for the Americas Initiative. But it remains doubtful that Mr. Bush will have any more success than his predecessors unless Latin Americans manage to create workable economies and democracies for themselves.
Mr. Bush's highly publicized campaign to halt Latin American drug trafficking has failed to make even a dent in the flow of Peruvian, Colombian and Bolivian cocaine into the United States. And the pride of his Latin America policy -- the electoral victory of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro over Nicaragua's Sandinista President, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, last February -- has not yet brought that country stability.
Mr. Bush traveled to South America, and to Mexico the week before, talking pesos and dolares. Wherever he went he promoted his enterprise initiative, which he described to the Uruguayan Congress as "an ambitious new plan to increase trade, investment and growth throughout the hemisphere."
 
Pushing Privatization
 "It is a major step," he declared, "in our shared dream for the world's first completely democratic hemisphere." He pushed for the privatization of state enterprises, cutbacks in public subsidies, and reductions in budget deficits in exchange for the Administration's support in encouraging Latin America's commercial creditors to ease interest rates on old debts.
Such free-market thinking is not new, but the emphasis he has placed on economic issues in his Latin America policy is. The last several American Presidents concentrated their energies on the strategic import of political developments in countries like Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panama and Cuba. The facts that Mr. Bush's visits to Argentina and Chile were the first by an American President since Dwight D. Eisenhower, and his visit to Venezuela the first since John F. Kennedy, demonstrate how long it has been since some of the largest and most economically important Latin American countries have figured so importantly in a hemispheric policy initiative from the White House.
Administration officials insist that Mr. Bush has not forgotten Central America, but that he has a far broader view of the importance of Latin America as a whole than did his most recent predecessors. They say he is keenly aware of Mexico's and Venezuela's vast oil potential, the shrinking of Brazil's Amazon rain forests, and the potential consumer market for United States exports that could be built among the more than 400 million people in the region.
As Mr. Bush repeatedly demonstrated in Mexico and South America, he gets on well with Latin Americans, and appears to genuinely enjoy Latin culture. He quickly picked up on the symbolism when Mexico's President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, invited him to his ancestral town of Agualeguas, and he reciprocated by personally removing Mr. Salinas' jacket at a rodeo. Mr. Bush has made some progress toward his policy goals by regularly consulting with Latin American presidents and even coordinating some of his policies with theirs -- most recently in attempts to reinvigorate the stalled peace talks in El Salvador and to assure fair elections in Haiti. Latin American leaders have noticed the attention, and relish it. President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela noted that because Mr. Bush "is a Texan and an oil man, he understands us and our strategic importance better." Argentina's President, Carlos Saul Menem, characterized Mr. Bush's Latin tour as "a fiesta of good neighborliness."
But all the good mutual feelings cannot assure success for Mr. Bush's new policy.
 
Structural Problems
 "President Bush has handled himself extraordinarily well compared to the old track record," said Roberto Eisenmann Jr., publisher of the Panama City daily La Prensa.
"But we have very definite structural problems," he said. "They go back as far as the colonial period, and the long U.S. record in Latin America has created a hostility that will not be easy to overcome."
Mr. Eisenmann predicted that last week's rebellion of police forces in his country would only be repeated, time and again, if Panama did not follow Costa Rica's example and disarm itself. What made the apparent coup attempt less than one year after the United States invasion particularly distressing to Washington was that it took American troops to end the revolt. Many analysts believe that it was that kind of dependency, ingrained during decades of intensive American involvement in the country, that contributed to the need for the invasion in the first place -- by having helped make the Panamanian people reluctant to overthrow Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega themselves.
Another military uprising, this one in Argentina -- the fourth unsuccessful one since 1987 -- forced President Menem to impose a state of siege and deploy tanks and air force bombers just 48 hours before Mr. Bush's visit. It was easily put down, and did not deter Mr. Bush from keeping to his schedule. But it was a reminder that problems most recently associated with Central America remain problems in South America as well.

The Port Authority Thinks It's Time to Build Again

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
IN their quest for more money for large projects, Port Authority and transit officials are singing a familiar song to Trenton and Albany: public spending, especially now in times of austerity, would help bolster the region's economy by creating thousands of new jobs and spurring billions of dollars in private investment. To pay for these projects, Port Authority officials are seeking authorization to raise bridge and tunnel tolls as well as PATH train fares, and the Metropolitan Transit Authority is seeking capital funds from the state and Federal governments.
Stanley Brezenoff, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, estimates that the agency's proposed $5.4 billion plan would stimulate $3.8 billion in private investments and create 166,000 construction jobs and 20,000 new permanent jobs. 
 But critics of such capital spending said projects like those the agency is planning often take so long to develop and initiate that new jobs and economic benefits are not realized until many years later when the region's fiscal woes have passed.
"These billion-dollar investments have to be justified based on their long-term impact to improve mass transit and not on whether they help put a few thousand people to work in the next few years," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit monitoring group financed by businesses in New York City.
But Mr. Brezenoff argued that his agency's capital plan would provide short-term benefits like jobs and economic growth as well as make the region's airports and marine terminals more competitive in the long term. "If we don't do something to insure that New York is a convenient place to ship goods and to travel to distant lands," Mr. Brezenoff said, "we will become a second-rate town and people will take their business elsewhere." The agency oversees Newark, LaGuardia and John. F. Kennedy airports, bridges, tunnels and PATH rail systems crossing the Hudson, the World Trade Center, the bus terminal and port operations.
The $5.4 billion the Port Authority is seeking would be used to continue major construction projects at all three airports that will ease congestion; finish rehabilitation work on the authority's Hudson River bridges and tunnels, and make improvements at the World Trade Center, which now needs some renovations if it is to attract prospective tenants, Mr. Brezenoff said.
Undertaking major rebuilding programs in times of economic decline, transit officials said, also enables them to finish more projects at less cost because contractors are more competitive in bidding for the work.
But in order for that to happen, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which receives little or no state and Federal subsidies for its capital programs, said it needs to raise the tolls on its bridges and tunnels to $4 from $3, and the fare on its PATH trains to $1.25 from $1, starting next year. The increases, which would pay for the capital program as well as daily operations, must be approved by the Port Authority board and the Governors of New York and New Jersey. A decision is expected sometime next month.
 
Getting 'the Best Deals'

 
 Many local politicians agree with transit officials that an infusion of capital into public transportation facilities would help boost a sagging economy. "We are in a position to get the best deals and the best people to do our infrastructure work at a time when they don't have much else to do," said Ruth Messinger, Manhattan Borough President. "If you put these people to work, you are fueling the local economy by generating taxes that would otherwise not be forthcoming."
 Next year, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates operates subways, commuter railroads and many bus routes in the New York City region, will complete a $16-billion, 10-year capital program to overhaul tracks, switches, signals and stations and buy new buses and subway cars. A recent study by the Port Authority found that the program has stimulated $19 billion in economic activity in the region, generated $741 million in tax revenues and created 14,800 jobs.
The transit agency is seeking an estimated $12 billion from the state and Federal governments to fund a new program that transit officials said is necessary to complete the rebuilding effort -- including equipment like new electronic turnstiles for subway stations -- and to maintain New York's mass transit system.
Mortimer Downing, the M.T.A.'s executive director, argued that there would be no delay in starting up capital projects at the M.T.A and the Port Authority. "We won't be starting projects from scratch," Mr. Downing said. "We are talking about projects that have been in the planning for years and that we could get underway in a matter of months."

The Deficit Issue Is Back, And Likely to Make a Mess

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
JUST when many people thought Congress had slain the deficit monster after a seemingly endless struggle, the beast reappeared bigger than ever.
Congress is coming to grips with reality and recognizing that the Federal budget deficit will set a record in the current fiscal year, 1991, and will probably rise higher in 1992, despite the five-year "deficit-reduction bill" signed by President Bush on Nov. 5. 
 The new estimates of the deficit issued last week by the Congressional Budget Office were not a surprise to anyone who followed the arcana of the debate that consumed hours and hours and hours toward the end of the 101st Congress. But the numbers were sobering for lawmakers and Bush Administration officials who warmly congratulated one another six weeks ago on their herculean labors to cut the deficit.
Since then, the economy has weakened, the United States military commitment in the Persian Gulf has deepened and the projected costs of the savings and loan bailout have risen. And Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the latest estimate of the deficit, $253 billion for the current fiscal year, was "a bit optimistic" since it was based on economic assumptions adopted in October.
So Congress and the President are gearing up for another battle, which will begin in earnest when Mr. Bush submits his proposals in early February. "Our best course is to build on this year's agreement, to use it as a foundation and to take advantage of the tough decisions that were made," said Representative Leon E. Panetta of California, chairman of the House Budget Committee. "That agreement does put us on the right course. But I suspect we will have to build upon that agreement additional deficit reduction."
 
Hidden Programs
 The budget is the main vehicle for such domestic policy as the Federal Government has these days. The 1991 budget bill, for example, expanded Medicaid coverage of poor children and provided $18 billion worth of new tax credits over five years for working poor families with children. Those changes would have been trumpeted as a major improvement in social welfare policy had they not been tucked away in a bill to raise taxes and trim spending for dozens of Government programs.
The political and intellectual debate on domestic policy is conducted in the shadow of the deficit. Democrats and Republicans alike have been cramped by their reluctance to raise taxes, and last month's election results will probably fortify their resistance to tax increases. Popular discontent over rising taxes was a factor in most of the 14 states where control of the governor's mansion shifted from one party to another.
The furious annual dance of budget legislation raises a few simple questions: Why can't the President submit more realistic budget proposals? Why can't Congress adhere to its schedule for acting on the budget? Why does Congress defer difficult decisions, then exhaust itself in a spasm of activity on the budget in the closing hours of each year's session? Why can't Democrats and Republicans moderate the partisanship that seems to poison most debates on the budget?
The struggle over the budget dramatizes the difference between real life and civics textbooks. The stakes are simply too high, in political and economic terms, for lobbyists, lawmakers and Federal agency officials to observe Marquis of Queensberry rules in sparring over the budget. No decision is final. No issue is too small to be reopened a week, a month or a year after a decision has been made. A budget bill is supposed to reconcile diverse interests, but there is never really reconciliation, only a brief truce till the fighting resumes.
A Presidential proposal initially dismissed by Congress as unrealistic may be accepted as lawmakers become desperate for savings and revenue. For example, Mr. Reagan's 1982 proposal to charge fees for entrance to national parks was initially hooted down by campers and environmentalists, but Congress eventually approved it, and some of the most popular parks, like Glacier and Yellowstone, now charge fees of $5 to $10 a vehicle.
Allen Schick, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland who has written several books on the Federal budget process, said that members of Congress "really hoped they had put the budget and deficit problem behind them until after the 1992 elections." But, he said, that hope might evaporate after the 102d Congress convenes on Jan. 3.
"Delay occurs not simply because of legislative gridlock or the big egos involved, but because some people gain from it," Mr. Schick said. "Waiting till the last minute changes the political balance of power in budgeting. The winners are the Congressional Appropriations Committees, which have a stronger voice in dictating what happens on the floor, and the committee chairmen, who determine what goes into the final bills."
Moreover, Mr. Schick said, "Congress perceives that it gains from going to the brink" and packaging tax and spending legislation in an omnibus bill. By signing such legislation, the President acquiesces in measures that he might veto if presented to him separately.
The budget has a different dynamic each year, and 1991 will differ from 1990 in several ways. Congressional leaders say they do not intend to enter another round of "summit negotiations" with the White House. This year's negotiations were excruciatingly difficult, and they riled rank-and-file lawmakers, who complained they had been left out.
 
Self-Discipline
 In theory, the budget should be subject to new discipline because of procedures adopted by Congress to enforce spending limits. There are separate limits on military, international and domestic spending; if a new law threatens to push outlays above the ceiling for any category, there would be automatic across-the-board cuts in that category. Under the law, Congress may consider suspending the enforcement mechanism if there is a recession.
The next round of fiscal fisticuffs may be easier because 1991 is not an election year, but it may be more difficult if the economic slump continues. Defenders of the budget agreement expect to come under pressure from two sides. With the deficit rising to record levels, some Republicans plan to push for further cuts in Federal spending. Just as surely, some Democrats will push for new spending to stimulate the sluggish economy, create jobs and provide assistance to people who cannot find work.
Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said he did not see a need now for increased spending to stimulate the economy, since most forecasters expect a short, shallow recession, not a severe downturn.
"The budget agreement we enacted into law has a life expectancy of two years and, if we are lucky, perhaps three," he said. "It accomplished all that the political system and the economy will let us do in the near term."

Europe's Farmers Plow a Trade Treaty Under

BYLINE: CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: BRUSSELS

 BODY:
THIS is not the way it was supposed to work out.
Because of their industrial interests, the United States and the European Community were expected to be on the same side in the trade talks that broke down Friday. Instead, they were at each other's throats. 
 The fights were supposed to come chiefly between developed and developing countries over opening up markets in financial and other service sectors and getting new rules to stop the piracy of patents and copyrights that occurs mainly in third-world countries.
Instead, the five days of a conference intended to wrap up a new agreement on opening up world trade degenerated into a spat between Washington and the Europeans over farm export subsidies.
These are the payments given to farmers to export surplus production at low world prices. The European Community is now subsidizing close to 25 million tons of food exports, and although this plays havoc with world trade, the community refused to meet demands to limit its subsidies. Hence the breakdown in the trade talks.
Washington had a powerful group of allies in 14 food exporting countries, known as the Cairns Group because they were organized in that Australian city. Those countries -- Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Fiji, Hungary, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand and Uruguay -- have seen some of their markets wiped out by the subsidized competition.
Their stakes are illustrated by these numbers: in those 14 countries live about 240 million farmers, compared with 10 million in the European Community and fewer than 2 million in the United States. "For countries like mine," said Marcos Costrioto de Azambuja, leader of the Brazilian trade team, "going through a painful process of economic readjustment, international trade is the indispensable condition for this process to succeed." For the trade negotiations to succeed, the Europeans will have to make some concessions on the export subsidies.
Facing strong political pressure from their own farmers, it was unlikely that the Europeans would cede in the near future, thus throwing the future of the trade liberalization effort into doubt.
This could be dangerous for the world, triggering trade tensions that could lead to creeping protectionism and eventually trade wars. Protection breeds protection. Trade could spiral downward as it did during the 1930's, bringing economic decline and job losses to most countries of the world.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Bush Ventures South

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
Those few norteamericanos who think about Latin America at all know that its nations have not been made safe for democracy by the collapse of the Soviet empire, by the two recent U.S. interventions in Nicaragua and Panama, or by the regional trend to free elections and free-market economies.
On his trip to five of those nations, President Bush made more headlines by his remarks on the Middle East than for anything concrete he offered or achieved. Still, if he had his eyes and ears open, he's bound to have come back to Washington with a heightened appreciation of Latin problems. 
 The most recent report of the Inter-American Dialogue, a high-level hemispheric forum, makes clear that the most pressing of these problems are economic. Since 1982, a debt-driven regional depression has cut per capita income in Latin America by more than 10 percent -- 25 percent in Peru and Argentina.
Aggregate foreign debt is $410 billion, nearly $100 billion more than in 1982, and requires a net annual outflow in interest and principal payments of about $25 billion -- or more than 20 percent of Latin American exports. Inflation and hyperinflation cripple the region. Infrastructure and industrial plant have deteriorated from lack of investment. Unemployment is up and wages are down, both drastically; housing, medical care and education have suffered in every country; crime is rampant in some.
In these circumstances, it's not surprising that 180 million Latins, 50 million more than in 1982, are living in poverty; that's two of every five people in the region. Only in Chile and Colombia have living standards risen -- though not by much -- in the last decade.
What can Mr. Bush do about any of this, with the U.S. also in an economic bind that's getting worse? The investment capital that Latin America needs is not readily available here; but Treasury Secretary Brady's debt-relief plan could be more flexible and the U.S. could write off some of its loans to Latin nations. Mr. Bush also might persuade U.S. banks to forgive some Latin debt, and he could influence multilateral lending agencies to be more lenient in debt rescheduling.
Most important, the President could work for -- not just talk about -- freer trade conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere, to open markets for Latin exports. That's doubly needed now, with recession in the U.S. likely to shrink imports.
One reason for Mr. Bush to take such steps is economic -- a more prosperous Latin America would provide badly needed markets for U.S. exports, thus helping to cut the trade deficit. Other reasons, as detailed in the Inter-American Dialogue report, are political and important to the hemisphere.
Sharp income disparities and endemic poverty, for one thing, are not conducive to political stability; the Shining Path in Peru and other insurgencies feed on economic inequity and depression. But free markets are not as immediately effective in reducing poverty as are, say, food subsidies, transfer payments, or public-sector jobs. If restive populations force governments too heavily into such programs, inflation and restricted economic growth would result -- making things worse economically, and probably causing the downfall of democratic governments not yet deeply rooted in Latin society.
Governments that stick to market economies and longer-term investments in health, education, and infrastructure are no doubt on the better road to higher living standards; but they will not quickly relieve Latin poverty. Even at a 5 percent growth rate -- unrealistic in most cases -- the Dialogue report estimates that "30 years or more would be needed to lift the poorest 20 percent of Latin Americans out of poverty." The slow pace of such reform also could bring popular reaction against democratic government and market economies.
The end of the cold war, however, casts a new light on Latin American affairs. Washington's exaggerated fear of Soviet penetration in the region, which brought so much grief to Chile, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, is a dead letter; and Fidel Castro's problem in Cuba is no longer to spread revolution but to survive. Without cold war worries, moreover, the U.S. can more freely join with Latin America in coping with problems -- drugs, crime, immigration, trade and environment -- important to both.
Thus, the U.S. has a needed new chance to help build hemispheric stability, cooperation and economic growth, in its own as well as the Latin interest; and Mr. Bush's trip may be a better omen than his misguided intervention in Panama.

HEADLINE: How Iraq Ate and Armed at Our Expense

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Saddam Hussein was a good guy but is now a bad guy. The print media, however, do not explain our Government's flexibility in rewarding good guys while they remain good.
To explain: America's largess of grain can be given to any country of the President's choosing at negotiated interest rates, with as long as three years to pay, under the Commodity Credit Corporation Act.
Under this act, President Nixon enabled Soviet grain buyers to wipe out all of America's emergency wheat reserves in a single month of purchasing (July 1972). A sharp increase in United States food prices followed this gigantic grain on credit move. Mr. Nixon's detente with the Soviet Union had a price.
From 1983 to May 1990, Iraq received $4.3 billion in dollar-denominated credits to buy our grain under this act. The Iraqis got loans from banks, mainly in Italy. The loans were guaranteed by the Commodity Credit Corporation, which gets its funds from the Agriculture Department's $40-billion-plus annual budget, which is funded by the Treasury.
Saddam Hussein was careful never to default on the up-to-three-year loans. But the loans were continuously additive to the much-discussed Federal budget deficit, at least from one accounting year to the next. Getting American grain in this way permitted Mr. Hussein to spend less of Iraq's scarce hard currency on food from year to year and thereby spend more on his military buildup.
Loans from the Commodity Credit Corporation to Iraq were finally cut off by the Department of Agriculture about two months before the invasion of Kuwait, under Senate pressure on human-rights grounds led by Senators Alfonse M. D'Amato and Daniel K. Inouye.

Finding It Hard To Say Goodbye To Chapel Hill

DATELINE: CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

 BODY:
Students at the University of North Carolina have long called their town the "Southern part of heaven," but recently many students have decided it is so heavenly that real life can wait.
Although the administration says it discourages students from prolonging their college years, the number of fifth-year seniors and those who remain in Chapel Hill after graduating is rising. 
 Of the entering freshmen in 1984, 19.2 percent graduated in five years, compared with 14.2 percent of those who entered in 1980, according to the university's Office of Institutional Research. And that does not include the students who graduated in four years but remain here.
While some students must extend their college years for financial reasons, and others because they studied abroad and need to complete graduation requirements, most students interviewed said they were staying longer because of the quality of life on campus and in Chapel Hill.
Many also said they were postponing having to look for a job in a tight labor market and dealing with a competitive world in general.
 
Parents Pay
 Christopher Smith of High Point is six hours short of graduating with a major in economics. Mr. Smith could have graduated over the summer had he taken one summer-school session. But he is worried about the tight job market and said he would rather wait a year than apply for jobs he does not want.
"I thought I'd hang around for as long as my parents will pay for it," he said. Tuition for 1990-91 is $1,084 for state residents, $5,752 for nonresidents.
"I love Chapel Hill," Mr. Smith added. "Where else do you want to live? I'm getting used to it."
What he is getting used to is three classes, or nine classroom hours, a week and a bartending job at a local restaurant, with some stints as a drummer for several bands. He spends much of his free time at his fraternity.
 
'Why Leave Chapel Hill?'
 "It was football season," said Kirk Stechmiller, a political science major from Gainesville, Fla., explaining his decision to prolong his college life, which is financed by Federal and state scholarships. His decision to extend his undergraduate studies, he said, was based on a desire to see a few more college football games. The Tar Heels won one of the 11 games they played last year.
"I want to enjoy the college atmosphere here," he said. "Why leave Chapel Hill?"
Jamie Block, who graduated last spring with a degree in English and is pursuing a career as a singer and a songwriter, said: "Chapel Hill is a pre-eminent music area that is pleasant to live in and affordable. Per capita, I don't know anywhere where there are more musicians."
Mr. Block, a native of Westhampton Beach, L.I., released his first album last spring and plays frequently in Chapel Hill's cafes and clubs.
"There are lots of people who get into original music here," he said. "This town has the tradition for taking risks as far as art goes."
Ian Williams, whose weekly humor column in the college newspaper made him a campus celebrity until he graduated last spring, said Chapel Hill was the perfect place to pursue a writing career. He is writing a fictional diary about the life of a college student while auditing classes in women's studies, English and religion.
Besides, said Mr. Williams, a music and psychology major from Arcadia, Calif., Chapel Hill makes him happy, "and if you want to write you have to be happy."
Mr. Williams also enjoys attending social events at his fraternity, where he has alumni status.
 
More Popular With Men
 Sally Kennedy, a senior international studies major from Atlanta, said she thinks men are more likely to remain at the school than women.
"I can think of three guys I know who have decided to stay," she said. "They thought they would have a good time if they stayed and could be with friends."
Susanne Huey, a senior German major from Charlotte, agreed, noting, "Men are so much more likely to prolong their college experience here because of the overabundance of women, whereas women are anxious to get out in the real world and meet men."
The ratio of female to male undergraduates at the university is 3 to 2, according to the Office of Institutional Research.
"Boys are in such a play-stage here," said Happy Hynes, a junior in political science from Charlotte.
Mark Pierce, an English major from Nashua, N.H., said he has taken the semester off to "hang out." He delivers pizzas to support himself. "Chapel Hill is the only place on earth where the waiters have Ph.D.'s and the homeless have master's," Mr. Pierce said.

HEADLINE: FORUM;
Japan's Mythical Trade Surplus

BYLINE: By Joel Kurtzman

 BODY:
Bill Totten, an American, has lived in Japan since 1969. In 1972, he started a company in Tokyo called Ashisuto to sell American software to Japanese companies. Ashisuto now has sales of about $100 million a year. Earlier this year, Mr. Totten published a book in Japanese about American-Japanese relations called "Don't Blame Japan." Mr. Totten spoke with Joel Kurtzman of The New York Times. 
 Q. Japan typically has trade surpluses with the United States in the range of $60 billion. But you have argued that in reality business between the two countries is in balance. What did you mean?
Mr. Totten: The American Government, in compiling its trade figures, uses statistics that exclude the production of American companies outside United States. For instance, I have a $4 million I.B.M. computer in my office in Tokyo. I thought it was American-made when I bought it. But I.B.M. executives in New York chose to manufacture my computer in Japan rather than in the United States. So the fact that I bought that computer in Japan is not included in the trade statistics. It wasn't exported; it was produced overseas.
Another example: I use a Schick razor every morning at my home in Tokyo. Seventy percent of Japanese males use Schick razors. But Schick, which is headquartered in Connecticut, sells razors in Japan that it makes in Hong Kong. So sales of those razors are not included in the trade statistics. They are not American exports.
 If you include the value of all American products sold to the Japanese versus the value of all Japanese products sold in America, you see they're roughly equal in dollar terms. That's why the statistics don't show that our two economies are really in balance.
Q. Critics of that argument say the existence of the trade balance nevertheless means foreign workers are displacing Americans. They also say American companies manufacture in Japan not because they want to but because Japan has been closed to imports. What do you say to the critics?
Mr. Totten: Well, my immediate reaction is that the American Government should talk to Mr. Akers at I.B.M. and ask him why he's not employing Americans to make the computers I buy in Japan. Why is he employing foreigners instead of Americans? Why beat up on the Japanese?
Q. But do you agree that Japan has put restrictions on some of the products America exports, like rice and specialty steel?
Mr. Totten: There are some specific incidents. But the metal thing was back about 10 years ago. And, yes, the rice thing is unfair. But we should remember that the Japanese are our best agricultural customer. We never mention that.
Q. You have been doing business in Japan since the early 1970's. How have you been accepted?
Mr. Totten: It is probably better to be an American doing business in Japan, than to be a Japanese doing business in Japan. Because I am an American, I've got special advantages. I might make a mistake in my manners or in the way I act, but as long as I'm not flaunting it or being deliberately rude, the Japanese are forgiving. They are much more forgiving of the foreigner than they are with each other.
Q. But so many companies complain that Japan is run like a club and Americans just can't get in. Have you found that to be the case?
Mr. Totten: Never. I've never heard of a person who speaks Japanese saying that.
I am fluent in Japanese. My wife and children don't even speak English. I conduct all my business and my home life in Japanese.
But most Americans trying to do business in Japan cannot speak the language at all. These Americans live in Tokyo in the equivalent of the Trump Tower and even though they are middle-level managers, they'll be chauffeured to and from their offices. These Americans will also spend all their time at the American Club or at the Foreign Press Club. They don't associate with the Japanese and they don't live in the Japanese consumer culture. If this is the case, how can they do business effectively?
Q. You have often criticized American software companies for being out of step with the Japanese markets. Is that still true?
Mr. Totten: I've changed my mind about that somewhat. The best-known American software companies -- the biggest ones that are very successful in the United States and other parts of the world -- tend to be arrogant or tend not to make their products fit the needs of the Japanese. They don't take that extra step. But lately, we have been finding a lot of smaller American software companies that are willing to make the effort. The small companies either customize their products for Japan -- which means adapting them to run on Fujitsu and Hitachi mainframes -- or they give us the manuscript and source codes so we can do it for them. They accept a 10 percent royalty. They let us do the pricing. They do everything needed to be successful in Japan. And we have picked up a number of products in the last six months from small American companies that previously didn't do any business overseas. It is our oldest suppliers, the biggest American software companies, that are not making the effort to expand in Japan.
Q. Do you run you business like an American company or a Japanese company?
Mr. Totten: Like a Japanese company. My total income from Ashisuto -- and I'm the founder, own 60 percent of the stock and am president -- is only eight times my average employee's salary. After taxes, my salary last year was only six times that of my average employee. That is typical of Japan.
What's typical in the United States? A ratio of about 93 to 1. And the people with that 93 to 1 ratio are not the company founders. They are the hired guns. Jim Mansey, chairman of Lotus, paid himself $17 million last year and fired 10 percent of his employees in August of this year. You see the difference? Jim Mansey is typical of American companies. That hurts them.
Why do I take only the amount of money I do? Because I run my company for the sake of our customers -- as the Japanese do. I don't run my company for the stockholders. But you know, what I am doing is no different from what I remember it was like in the United States when I grew up in the 1940's and 1950's.
I don't think the chief executive should make all the money. If he does, why would an employee work so hard? And my employees have lifetime employment. That's typical. In Japan employees get a very fair share. That is why they are more productive. And productive employees don't get shoved out the door as soon as profits take a downturn.

HEADLINE: From Copland, the Gift of Complexity

BYLINE: By ARTHUR BERGER; Arthur Berger is a composer whose writings include "Aaron Copland," published by Oxford University Press in 1953 and reprinted by Da Capo.

 BODY:
Aaron Copland, who died last Sunday at the age of 90, had a reputation as a mild-mannered person, not at all given to the flares of temperament associated with musical genius. No more severe a test of his tolerance is imaginable than the evenings he spent as host to a certain small group of young composers in the 1930's. I became part of the group when I was brought to one of the gatherings by some classmates at New York University.
These were stormy sessions, highly vocal and rowdy, with sharp disagreements on matters of both musical esthetics and world politics. (I still have a postcard inviting me to a session, with "no polemics" scrawled on it in Copland's hand.) Copland somehow was above it all, and our shared devotion to him as our mentor kept us together for several years, during which time we became known as the Young Composers Group. 
 Having spent the early 1920's studying with Nadia Boulanger in Paris during the heyday of the boisterous Group of Six, Copland was delighted with the idea, and he fancied himself in the role of Erik Satie, who had been the central figure around whom that group revolved. But unlike Satie, Copland did not strongly influence the style of members of his coterie. Perhaps he had something to do with the Americanism of Elie Siegmeister, one member of the group. But one would be hard put to find his influence in the others: Bernard Herrmann, Jerome Moross, Vivian Fine, Henry Brant, Lehman Engel, Israel Citkowitz and Irwin Heilner.
The reason may very well be that Copland's style was too personal, so that while it can be readily imitated -- as is all too evident from the myriad television and Hollywood background scores that have done precisely this -- it does not provide an optimum point from which the composer may go on to a personal style. There are traces of a Coplandesque turn of phrase in some works of Leonard Bernstein, Irving Fine, Harold Shapero and even the early Elliott Carter. But it is hard to think of Copland, as one can so easily think of Schoenberg or the Neo-Classic Stravinsky, as a progenitor of a school.
Copland's influence -- and there surely has been one -- cannot be localized. It lies in the realm of such intangibles as sensitivity to the beauty and transparency of the musical surface, voluminousness that derives from the wide spacing of chords, and virtues like economy of means, honesty and directness.
From his own vantage point as a composer, Copland's highly recognizable musical profile stood him in good stead whenever he decided to shift course for various reasons -- among them always, a determination not to lapse into routine. First there was the abandonment around 1930 of his overt use of jazz in favor of a manner that sublimates it within what, it is now hard to believe, was considered a ferociously far-out austerity. Then there was the shift in the mid-30's -- back, in one sense, to the jazz-inspired period, but using folk songs instead of jazz in a special effort to reach a much larger audience than the limited modern-music audience for which he had been writing.
Finally in 1950 this paradigm of a diatonic composer surprised us all by announcing with his Piano Quartet that he had joined the hitherto enemy camp of the serialists. But through all these metamorphoses Copland's musical personality suffered not the least occlusion.
The transformations did, however, call down on him the wrath of some of his most ardent devotees. I spoke out against his simplification of music, which he undertook largely as a response to the pressures of the Federal Works Progress Administration and the leftist intellectual climate. I soon realized, however, that Copland was not writing down to the public, that he was employing some of the same craft and sensitivity that went into his masterly less accessible works.
At the same time, one of my worst fears has become a reality. The number of performances of the more popular works inevitably has had the effect of shutting the other music out. Indeed, some people are scarcely aware of that music's existence. When they learn about it, chances are they reason that since Copland's more popular works are so good at being what they purport to be, it is doubtful he would be capable of the profundity and complex musical thinking that go into the loftiest serious music. How misguided they are! One of the best ways in which tribute can be paid to this master of American music, our erstwhile dean of composers, is to encourage performers to pay more than token tribute to this relatively neglected portion of his legacy -- works like "Connotations" or even the problematic "Short Symphony."
Those who attacked Copland for his serialism may not be aware why it was appropriate for him to embrace the method in the 50's but not in the 30's. In the earlier period Copland was concerned with developing a distinctly indigenous idiom. At that time serialism transported to our soil maintained the aura of its Viennese origin. By the 50's it was liberated from its national affiliations, and as a neutral technique, it was adopted by Luigi Dallapiccola in Italy and Pierre Boulez in France. Presently Stravinsky joined the company. In all these cases, the Teutonic roots of the method, as in Copland's case, were no longer discernible as such.
Copland's stylistic shifts presented no problem to anyone who understood his personality, and I know of no more insightful analysis of this than the one advanced many years ago by Israel Citkowitz: "All in all, Aaron Copland is a most elusive personality. One could no sooner describe a particular quality than its opposite would appear to counter it. In a less well-balanced personality, these contradictions would create conflict and division. Copland can balance them, and, far from canceling out, these opposites complement each other and work together like well-meshed gears."
Who would ever have expected a Brooklyn-born composer passionately devoted to the New York scene to have so magnificently translated into musical terms the atmosphere of the American West? I remember an evening in August 1949 riding in a car behind one driven quite slowly by Copland on the way to his studio outside of Tanglewood. Suddenly a cow dashed into his headlights.
We rued the death of the poor animal and sympathized with Copland for the ordeal he had to endure at the hands of state troopers. But we were all terribly amused by the irony that this was the closest the composer of "Rodeo" had ever come to a cow.

HEADLINE: The Spirited and Erudite Oration That Could Fail

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
On Friday morning, Jack Valenti will rise before the members of the Federal Communications Commission at a hearing in Washington. Nattily attired, no doubt, with every strand of his silver hair in place, he will launch into a spirited and erudite oration in defense of the Federal regulations that govern the economic relationship between Hollywood's movie studios, which he has represented in the nation's capital for nearly 25 years, and the television networks.
His Texas twang will ring with conviction as he pleads with the commission not to abolish the regulations. If true to voluble form, he will quote philosophers and generals, cite statistics and rail against the power of networks and their corporate parents to dominate the airwaves. 
 Mr. Valenti, 69 years old, head of the Motion Picture Association of America, is widely regarded as one of the most effective lobbyists in Washington. Since being recruited to the motion picture trade in '66 from the White House, where he was a top aide to President Lyndon B. Johnson, he has by all accounts served as a tireless advocate for his constituency.
But on this issue, which centers on whether the networks should be allowed to share more in the often-lucrative proceeds studios receive from the sale of rerun rights to prime-time programs, he and the motion picture association are fighting a defensive action. Most industry executives expect the commission to loosen or eliminate the regulations, known as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, which restrict the ability of the networks to share in rerun revenues by strictly limiting their ownership of the shows produced for them by the studios. The commission hears arguments on Friday.
The debate illustrates how diverging business strategies and economic interests of the major studios have reduced Hollywood's clout in Washington. The issue nominally pits the big studios against the networks, but one of the studios, the Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation, now operates a network. Mr. Valenti has tried to frame the issue in terms of how much power the networks should be given over programming. But the recent acquisition of MCA Inc. by the Matsushita Electric Industrial Corporation of Japan, the fourth acquisition of a major studio by a foreign company in recent years, has shifted attention to whether foreign companies should be free to invest in and profit from businesses that the current regulations leave largely off limits to American networks.
This debate is not the only one in which Mr. Valenti has found his effectiveness stifled. After years of railing against concentration of ownership in the cable television business, Mr. Valenti and the motion picture association suddenly had to curtail their complaints last year when Warner Communications Inc., parent of Warner Brothers studio, merged with Time Inc., a major player in cable.
"When I first came in, I had the easiest job in the world, and I didn't realize it," Mr. Valenti said in a recent interview. "All we were concerned with was television and movies. I worked with a tightly bound group of companies, all with the same interests and motives. Now I've got companies that are moving into different interests and all of a sudden I'm being assaulted by problems and issues that never existed before."
An increasing amount of his time is spent on international trade. Entertainment may be the one business in which the United States retains worldwide dominance, and expanding foreign markets is a top priority for all studios. In Brussels recently, Mr. Valenti urged American trade negotiators to forestall efforts by France to limit imports to the European Community of American films and television shows.
Mr. Valenti is by no means the only person speaking for studios and producers in the current battle with the networks. Robert Daley, the head of Warner Brothers, is the lead negotiator for the studios, and the heads of most of the other studios will also make their case before the F.C.C. But Mr. Valenti has long served as the point man on the issue.
For the better portion of the last decade, he has been telling anyone who would listen that the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules are an essential safeguard for the studios and Hollywood's creative community against what he terms the "all-powerful" networks. If the networks are given greater freedom to own shows, he argues, there will be nothing to stop them from strong-arming producers into caving in on creative disputes and giving up a portion of the financial stake in a show in return for a crack at the network's airwaves
The networks see the situation very differently, of course. They argue that the rules, which were imposed 20 years ago, reflect an outdated view of the entertainment business. The reasoning behind the rules was primarily to prevent ABC, CBS and NBC from forcing producers to give up a portion of their ownership of a show -- a "financial interest" -- in return for the network putting it on the air.
But the networks argue that they no longer dominate broadcasting. On any given night, only about two-thirds of American homes with televisions on are watching one of the three networks, down from 90 percent in 1970. The networks face increasing competition from cable, independent stations and videocassette recorders, not to mention the studios and parent companies. Twentieth Century-Fox's network has become a serious rival on the two nights a week that it broadcasts head-on against ABC, CBS and NBC. Time Warner's HBO is a major force in entertainment. The networks say it is unfair for the studios to be able to compete on their turf without giving them a chance to profit from syndication.

MR. VALENTI won't give. "If this rule is abolished or shrunk, there will be no surcease for the networks," he said, unashamedly describing the matter as one of life and death. "They will own you -- dominate you."
For years, Mr. Valenti's public broadsides and private lobbying were highly effective. He seems to be on a first-name basis with half the members of Congress, many of whom regularly accept invitations to view a new film in the screening room of the motion picture association's headquarters near the White House. He opens the doors of Hollywood's executive suites to legislators hungry for campaign contributions and urges industry executives to become more involved in supporting candidates.
No incident did more to cement his lobbying reputation than his handling of an F.C.C. vote in 1983 to repeal the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules. The networks appeared to have won the day, but Mr. Valenti went right to Congress, skillfully exploited its fears of network economic power, and successfully lobbied for a bill that blocked the commission.
Today, the political winds are blowing against Mr. More than any other factor, the change is attributable to the growth in the foreign ownership of studios. The networks are making political hay by citing the increasing foreign control of Hollywood while the current regulations keep the networks from owning studios or participating in worldwide consolidation of the entertainment industry.
The situation does not seem to have rattled Mr. Valenti, who continues to operate at warp speed, as he has since his youth in Texas. Growing up in Houston, he got his first job at the age of 15, working, fittingly, as an usher in a movie theater. He went on to work in advertising at Humble Oil, to serve as a bomber pilot in World War II and then to get an M.B.A. at Harvard Business School.
HE went back to Houston and started an advertising agency. By the mid-50's, he had gotten to know and admire then-Senator Lyndon Johnson, wrote some speeches for him and became an unofficial adviser. On Nov. 22, 1963, he was riding in the motorcade in Dallas when President Kennedy was assassinated; within hours, the new President had "ordered" him to Washington. There, Mr. Valenti developed a reputation as a fierce loyalist, if not apologist, for his boss, and was widely mocked for a comment made in 1965: "I sleep each night a little better, a little more confidently because Lyndon Johnson is my President."
While at the White House, Mr. Valenti caught the eyes of several of the President's closest friends and advisers, among them Lew Wasserman, who was then and remains today the head of MCA. When the studios found themselves in need of a new head for their trade group in Washington, they quickly offered the job to Mr. Valenti -- after receiving permission from the President. Mr. Valenti, fascinated by the movie business, accepted, and has been at it since.
To the network Mr. Valenti is a constant annoyance, someone they are forced to take seriously even though many of them consider him little more than a loudmouth. But those for whom he works have high praise: "He's been ideal for the job and the job has been ideal for him," said Mr. Wasserman. "People always make fun of him for that thing he said about Johnson. But I once said to someone, and I mean it, that I sleep a little more soundly at night knowing that Jack Valenti is head of the motion picture association."
 
WHERE THE COSBY DOLLARS GO
 The Carsey-Werner Company has made hundreds of millions of dollars selling rerun rights to "The Cosby Show," one of the hit series it produces. But not a dime of the syndication profit has gone to NBC, which broadcasts the show's initial run. NBC has no actual ownership in "Cosby."
The network has made plenty of money on the show because of its high ratings, which translate directly into huge advertising revenues. But in the future, NBC, CBS and ABC want to to share in syndication windfalls.
Current regulations strictly limiting the ability of the networks to own shows or profit from syndication are key to the economics of the television business. Under the system, producers and studios make shows for less than the networks pay to air them -- usually hundreds of thousands of dollars per episode less -- in return for a chance at the windfall.
The studios say they are now willing to give the networks greater opportunities to own shows, within limits. But the networks, sensing that the rules may be abolished by the Federal Communications Commission, have been reluctant to agree to any compromise. The next few months may tell.

HEADLINE: New Haven Sends Needles Into the Battle Against AIDS

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
SONIA LUGO said the drug addicts were already waiting when she and two colleagues drove into the Hill section of New Haven the other day. While her two co-workers, Arthur Stewart and Dominick Maldonado, set up supplies in the back of their blue van, Ms. Lugo said, she walked down the street looking for new clients.
Before long, people began lining up to receive their condoms, hypodermic needles and packets of bleach. Mr. Stewart, meanwhile, counseled each one about ways to avoid contracting or transmitting sexual diseases and where to seek drug treatment. After the people dispersed, the three outreach workers drove to the Fair Haven section and repeated the process. 
 "We're on a rescue mission, all right," Ms. Lugo said recently as she and her colleagues restocked their van outside the office of the New Haven Health Department's AIDS division.
The mission began on Nov. 13, when the city started its needle-exchange program. It is intended to help reduce the spread of the AIDS virus by providing clean needles to intravenous drug users, who transmit the disease by sharing needles. It also aims to curb the city's drug-abuse rate by assisting addicts who wish to enter treatment programs.
 
Assistance From Yale
 Last spring, the legislature granted the pilot project an exemption from the state law that forbids the distribution of hypodermic needles without a prescription. The lawmakers have earmarked $25,000 for the program's supplies, and Yale University donated the van and is providing evaluation services.
New Haven has the highest AIDS rate in the state, with some 75 percent of the city's reported cases related to intravenous drug use, said a report issued by the Mayor's Task Force on AIDS. Dr. Patricia Checko, director of immunology in the AIDS section of the State Health Services Department, said that by October, the city had 341 of 1,825 AIDS cases reported in the state since 1980, followed by Hartford, with 302 cases, and Bridgeport, with 173.
The AIDS rate in the state's three largest cities also surpasses the national average, she said. Figures show 15 AIDS cases for every 100,000 people in the United States, she said, while New Haven has 56 cases for every 100,000 residents, Hartford has 65 cases, and Bridgeport has 29.
The needle-exchange program has received wide support from state and local officials, the New Haven Police Department and Mayor John C. Daniels.
The nation's first government-sponsored needle-exchange program began in New York City in 1988. It immediately ran into a political thicket, with one City Councilman comparing it to genocide of black and Hispanic people, who are a majority of the city's drug abusers. The program never enrolled more than about 300 people and was scrapped earlier this year by Mayor David N. Dinkins.
Mayor Daniels said that as a State Senator, he opposed needle-exchange programs for fear they would encourage drug abuse. But he changed his mind, he said, after he was elected Mayor in 1989.
"This disease is running rampant," he said. "The city has one of the highest AIDS rates per capita in the country, and we have to do everything we can to stop it and its devastating effects." He said he has received dozens of phone calls from officials in cities throughout the nation asking about the program.
Opponents say that the pilot project is merely a stopgap that may eventually do more harm than good. Though it may stem the tide of AIDS, they say, the city does not have the resources or the drug-treatment openings to make the program effective.
"If this were a responsible client population, it might work," said Toni Harp, a New Haven Alderwoman and project coordinator for the Homeless Health Care Project at the Hill Health Center in the city. "But with addicts, the need for drugs outweighs any kind of responsibility."
Elaine O'Keefe, the director of the AIDS division of the New Haven Health Department, said that coping with the AIDS crisis is made more difficult by the myths about people who are addicted to drugs and have contracted the virus through needle sharing. She said that interviews with drug abusers over the past four years showed that they would use clean needles if they were available. "The reason drug addicts share needles is because of economics or fear of arrest," she said, "not because they are on a suicide mission or because sharing needles is part of some social ritual."
A new state-financed drug-rehabilitation program is scheduled to begin within the next month in the city, Ms. O'Keefe said, providing services for 75 addicts. She added that the outreach workers for the needle-exchange program are also assisting people through the bureaucratic maze of the drug-treatment system. Of the 100 people who have enrolled in the needle-exchange program so far, she said, 4 have begun drug treatment.
 
'No Stranger to These Streets'
 The program's advocates say that one of its strengths is its outreach workers, all veteran drug-abuse counselors who live in or near the neighborhoods they are trying to reach. They have been doing AIDS-prevention education in these areas for nearly four years.
"We're no strangers to these streets," said Mr. Maldonado, "which is why it's easy for us to pull up our van and strike up a rapport."
Both Mr. Stewart and Ms. Lugo said that they have undergone treatment for drug addiction, and that they are proof that it is possible to change an addict's behavior. Ms. Lugo, who served six months in the women's state prison in Niantic for a drug charge five years ago, said she has since returned as a social worker to talk to inmates about AIDS prevention and the effects of drug abuse.
"If an addict tells me that I have no idea what he's going through, I tell him that I've been there, and I do know the pain," said Ms. Lugo.
The outreach staff members said they have seen their share of friends, colleagues and clients die from AIDS. Because most of the disease's victims in New Haven are poor drug users, said Mr. Maldonado, "there's a growing indifference to the epidemic, which has made our job that much harder."
Given the nature and the urgency of the needle exchange and other AIDS-prevention measures, he and his colleagues often receive phone calls at home or visits from family members of addicts. "There is no way to leave AIDS at the office," he said.
 
Ficticious Names Used
 Four days a week, the team travels to several sites in the city noted for high drug traffic. An identification card is issued to everyone who enrolls in the program, but ficticious names are used to protect the addicts' privacy. Once they receive individual AIDS-prevention counseling and information on drug treatment, addicts are given condoms, five hypodermic needles and a packet of bleach with instructions on how to clean the needles once they are used.
Participants must return their used needles before they receive new ones. The workers place the returned needles in tin vials, which are stored in a plastic container. At the end of the day, the needles are taken to Yale for evaluation and disposal. A counselor is also on call at the AIDS division office to answer questions about treatment programs and other concerns.
Outreach workers are required to interview each participant every three months to determine if there has been a change in behavior. That information, along with the needle-return rates, will be analyzed and assessed by medical and management experts at Yale.
Dr. Don DesJarlais, director of research for the Chemical Dependency Institute at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York and an expert on needle-exchange programs in the United States and Europe, said early research has shown that programs in Amsterdam, London and Tacoma, Wash., reduced needle sharing and the risk of transmitting AIDS without increasing drug use.
"There is absolutely no evidence that these programs have any negative effects," he said. "They are also serving as an excellent referral source for getting people into drug-treatment programs."
Because of New Haven's high percentage of intravenous drug users who have been exposed to the virus, he said, its exchange program will be watched closely by health officials across the country. He added that there are five other similar programs in operation, as well as underground exchanges in several major cities.
But even in the program's early stages, said Ms. Lugo, residents of the city's drug-torn neighborhoods say that the program is having an impact. While canvassing the Hill section recently, she said, she was approached by a well-known drug dealer who cursed her and the program for taking away his customers.
"Let me tell you," she said with a proud smile, "that really made my day."

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT Q&A: DR. LEWIS MANDELL;
Boosting the Image of Financial Planners

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
DR. LEWIS MANDELL, a professor of finance at the University of Connecticut for 11 years, has started a couple of successful businesses and is a consultant to several corporations. Next spring, he will become the first editor of Financial Services Review. Its publisher, J.A.I. Press of Greenwich, said the review, with an initial circulation of 2,000, will attempt to give scientific credibility to the field of financial planning.
Several private organizations certify financial planners, but there are no government or academic standards for the field, said Dr. Mandell. He answered questions about the new journal and financial planning during a recent interview at his office in Storrs. Here are some excerpts from the conversation. 
 Q. Why do you view it as such a big step to launch this journal?
 A. There is no textbook in financial planning that treats it as an application of theory of finance. We need the textbook, we need basic research, we need the journal, and that's what we're doing. Once we have the journal going, the researchers in the field will say, "You know, it's now respectable to do work in financial planning." I predict that in 10 years this will be an academic field.
 Q. What kind of articles will be in the first issue?
 A. There is a very interesting article by Harry Markowitz, who won the Nobel Prize for finance recently. He won by being the first person to look at optimal portfolio construction. He didn't do it for an individual, and it's applied every day now by corporations, mutual funds, and institutional investors. What Markowitz did was he said, "How do we apply this theory to the individual?" We have a very useful methodology that everyone agrees is appropriate.
 Q. What kind of academic panel will be overseeing the Review?
 A. The group that formed has called itself the Academy of Financial Services. You have to call yourselves something, and we all know what we're interested in. But we did not want to have "financial management" in the name of the organization or the journal because of the generally low esteem in which financial planning has been held.
 Q. Why?
 A. Because it has very little basis in science. It's almost like medicine -- if a group of people claim to have a new kind of medicine, but they have no medical training, they have never taken anatomy or biochemistry, I'm not sure how many physicians would want to be associated with them.
 Q. Is there any way of telling if you're getting good financial planning advice?
 A. What you can do is go and get a second opinion, or a third or fourth opinion, and see the degree of variance between them. In choosing a financial planner, it's important to choose someone who has had a good education, who has studied a fair amount in finance.
 Q. How do you choose a planner?
 A. You want to make sure, first of all, that the planner knows finance, that he is not going to give you an absolutely wrong answer on a relatively simple question. Secondly, make sure that person is really up on what is happening in the economy. Can that person talk about what is happening in Hungary, and how the situation in Czechoslovakia is going to impact upon us?
 Q. What recourse do people have if they get bad financial advice?
 A. Really none. They're afforded little protection by law. In fact, I would say they're afforded literally no protection.
A financial planner is supposed to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an R.I.A., registered investment adviser. But to do that all you have to do is pay a fee of a couple of hundred dollars and fill out a form. I can say, "I'm a registered investment adviser, registered with the S.E.C." And people say: "Wow, that's super. You're certified by the S.E.C." But there is no certification involved.
The same thing is true of states. There are a few states that make you pass a little exam, but it's really a compliance exam, to make sure you know the laws pertaining to giving advice, not to certify whether you are qualified to give advice.
Anyone can do it. I think even if you're a convicted felon, you can do it from jail.
Q. What about recourse in civil courts?
A. It isn't going to be very long before the lawyers will start to get involved. Anyone who gives advice is expected to know the current state of the art in the field. There have been a lot of lawsuits when pension funds didn't use state-of-the-art finance techniques, and those suits were successful.
 Q. Can you give an example of the type of bad advice you might get from an untrained financial planner?
 A. One of the questions most asked financial planners today is: "I just inherited enough to pay off my mortgage. Should I do it?" They usually will ask about the interest rate on the mortgage, and it might be 10 percent. Then they ask how much you can get for the money in the bank, and the answer might be 8 percent. So the answer appears pretty simple -- you're better off paying off the mortgage. It turns out that answer is wrong, and it's wrong for reasons most financial planners wouldn't know, because they don't study it.
A very contemporary issue in finance is option-pricing theory. Financial planners think an option is something you buy if you want to lose all your money. But suppose you have a 30-year mortgage at a fixed rate of 10 percent. That mortgage has some valuable features, and one of them is that if interest rates go up, the bank cannot charge me more than 10 percent, but if they go down to 8 percent I can refinance. That gives me, in essence, what's called a put option on that, and that's very valuable. To tell someone to give that up is having them give up something that's worth thousands and thousands of dollars.
 Q. What are your own financial planning achievements?
 A. Ever since I've been in the profession, I've been writing books. I have been doing consulting. I'm an inventor with a number of products out there. I have businesses that I have started, and I have other people selling products for me. But that is a very interesting question, and it's a question of what I do with my own assets.
One thing I am not doing is buying Connecticut real estate. We had a fair amount of money in money-market funds, but now we read that the reason some of those funds were paying such high rates is they had a lot of money in junk commercial paper. The first big money-market fund that goes down is going to topple the others. Recently, I bought Connecticut municipal bonds.
 I'm not always my own best financial planner. I'm not always moving my assets around as quickly as I advise people to do so. But things I believe in, I am at least moving in those directions.
 Q. What kind of returns should you expect from investments these days?
 A. Your risk-free rate of return is the Treasury bill, which has been in the range of 7 or 8 percent, which is free of state income taxes. And if you can't do better than that, you really aren't trying.
 In terms of how you allocate your assets, there is an interesting discussion going on among financial planners. Financial planning is not just finance. It's a combination of finance and psychology. If we have a portfolio we're running for a corporation or mutual fund, we will try to invest some of it in liquid assets, and the rest of it, maybe 80 percent, in index funds, depending on how much risk you want to take.
But look at an individual family, and look at how they choose to hold their money. They are not doing it the way we in finance say they should be doing it. Rather, people are earmarking funds for specific purposes and holding funds in vehicles that match those needs.
If I have a kid who's going to college in five years, I probably don't have those funds in a risky investment, because the time is getting close. If the kid was 2, I might be willing to take more of a risk, because I've got more time.
 Q. Will this journal be giving actual financial planning advice?
 A. No. You really can't begin by giving people advice; you have to begin with theory. There is a tremendous amount known in finance and economics and theory, but there is not a great deal of linkage. The people who call themselves financial planners don't necessarily have a great deal of training. Many of them have never had a course in finance, believe it or not.
 Q. Has there been any improvement in the way financial planners are trained?
A. Certification was originally issued by the College of Financial Planning in Denver, which was a proprietary institution founded by a bunch of financial planners. Initially -- and still, in fact -- you send them some money, about $1,500, and they send you some books to study, and you take a test. If you pass the test, you get certification.
But of course, the test reflects the way the industry was set up, around the notions and beliefs of a few people who got together and began doing the certifying. A few years ago, a university in the New York area wanted to start certifying financial planners. There was an antitrust suit against the College of Financial Planning, and the settlement involved the formation of the International Bureau of Standards for Certified Financial Planning.
They represent a bright spot on the horizon, maybe the only bright spot. They have been trying to make financial planning into a respectable field. They have been trying to get colleges and universities around the country to offer the courses needed for financial planning.

HEADLINE: Hard Times Give Subways a Reason to Streamline Service

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is ironic how the New York City Transit Authority reaches for the wrecking ball on transit services at the first sign of recession (news article, Nov. 16) when public transportation is the most economical and environmentally efficient means of moving people.
Instead of proposals that doom round-the-clock buses and trains, which are the lifeblood of New York's 24-hour-a-day existence, the Transit Authority should use the downturn to complete renovation work on the subway system at lower-than-boom-time prices. It should also find ways to streamline its operations and improve services, such as consolidating the myriad local private subsidized bus lines under its operations planning, so that all buses will go where and when the public goes.
Questionable projects pushed during the good years, such as the 63d Street connector to the IND subway lines under Northern Boulevard, could be re-examined. Cheaper proposals to accomplish roughly the same objectives, such as building a transfer station on the new subway alignment under the Queens Boulevard station should be looked at.
The Transit Authority can take its renovation work, integrated bus system and subway improvements and aggressively market its services as recession-proof transportation, compared with the much more costly private automobile and taxis. In view of the Federal Clean Air Act mandate on New York City to cut back on smog, this approach would also be environmentally wise and pay off in the long run, getting more people out of private transportation and into public transit.

HEADLINE: Gulf Analogy: Munich or Vietnam?

BYLINE: By Alexander M. Haig Jr.; Alexander M. Haig Jr., Secretary of State from 1981 to 1982, was Supreme Commander of NATO from 1975 to 1979.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
International conflicts attract historical analogies the way honey attracts bears, because the "lessons learned" from such analogies are supposed to help us avoid past mistakes. The Persian Gulf crisis is no exception, and two analogies in particular -- Munich and Vietnam -- might have something to tell us.
The first, more familiar to older Americans, is Munich -- the story of the disastrous appeasement of Hitler, redeemed later only by horrible loss of life in a terrible war. The second, more familiar to younger Americans, is Vietnam -- the story of disastrous American military involvement, never redeemed despite its costs. 
 Which analogy, Munich or Vietnam, the 1930's or the 1960's, has more to tell us?
Munich symbolized the failure of the international community to defend basic values: freedom, sovereignty, the settlement of conflict without resort to force. Throughout the 1930's, Japan, Italy and Germany successfully challenged those values.
Spurious historical claims, geopolitical "interests," ethnic and racial theories were invoked by aggressors to justify their conquests. Victims included both neighbors, such as Czechoslovakia or Manchuria, and distant lands, such as Ethiopia.
That some of the states conquered were primitive or, in any event, remote from the concerns of the democracies were facts used by the aggressors and their apologists to argue that their actions "did not matter" or did not "affect vital interests." But each conquest strengthened the aggressors until finally vital interests were unambiguously threatened.
Yet, the important difference between 1935 and 1939 was that the military power of the aggressors grew. When war ultimately became the only effective means of resistance, the odds did not favor the defenders of freedom, and the costs in blood and national treasure mounted dramatically.
Saddam Hussein and Iraq fit important parts of this metaphor. His stated reasons for assaulting Kuwait are spurious history, a claim of economic necessity and a vaulting ambition to "lead" the Arabs. These are excuses he can use over and over again to justify further aggression.
Like Nazi Germany, Saddam Hussein's Iraq can only enjoy the benefits of its conquest if the international community acquiesces. Armed with the benefits of aggression, including oil, Iraq will surely be much the stronger, much better able to buy and perfect the weapons of mass destruction that its leader craves.
In short, the appeasement of Saddam Hussein, like that of his forebearers in the 30's, would favor a greater crisis later and enlarge Iraq's capability to prevail in such a crisis. Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, possibly Egypt, surely Israel, would be drawn one by one into either submission or conflict.
After an Iraqi victory in the gulf, it is all too easy to foresee the U.S. and Israel standing together against a hostile Iraq-led Arab world. It is almost as easy to see Israel standing alone against an international coalition intent on forcing it to take actions against its vital interests, the better to avoid a test of strength with Saddam Hussein and the Arabs. In short, a real Munich.
The Munich metaphor, however powerful its appeal, must compete with another striking American memory: Vietnam. The Vietnam metaphor appeals to two very influential groups, the moralists and the pragmatists.
The moralists saw Ho Chi Minh's Vietnam as a victim of imperialism; some also condemned the war as illegal because it had never been declared by Congress. But both will find Iraq hard to fit into these categories.
No one seriously suggests that Saddam Hussein is a misunderstood victim rather than a willful criminal. And as for the legalities, the worst distortion of the Vietnam metaphor is to believe that a declaration of war would have mattered. The Tonkin Gulf Resolution served well until the war went badly. A declaration of war would have been overtaken by the same loss of popular support.
The same would apply in the gulf crisis. Prompt military success or failure, not a Congressional declaration or lack thereof, will determine the decisive level of popular support. Prudent and meticulous consultation, rather than endless uninformed debate and authorizing votes makes far better sense.
It is not misplaced morality or misunderstood legalism that matters most but a far more potent Vietnam metaphor: success or failure. Today, most Americans remember U.S. policy in Southeast Asia as self-defeating. It was a war without clear political purpose or definable military objective.
Most Americans eventually joined this pragmatic group, forcing the U.S. to withdraw. Their question today is, Do we have a gulf policy with clear and justifiable purpose? If we go to war, is there a definable and achievable end?
The President has in fact defined clear purposes: unconditional Iraqi withdrawal; restoration of the legitimate Kuwait Government; protection of American lives, and peace and stability in the gulf.
He has justified these demands on several grounds: the stakes for international peace in the post-cold-war period; the danger that Iraq might lead the gulf and the Middle East into even greater conflict later and the dangers to the international economy of Iraqi domination of the oil supply. And he has said that the conflict can be resolved peacefully if Iraq cares to do so -- that is, resolved in accordance with the Security Council resolutions, not through so-called "partial solutions" that reward Iraq for its aggression.
Some "pragmatists" are troubled by the thought that this leaves no face-saving way for Iraq to get out. But we have no reason to help Saddam Hussein unless we believe that by doing so we avoid something worse, such as war. But if we believe that Saddam Hussein eventually must be rewarded to avoid war, then our current military efforts are essentially a bluff and that bluff will be called. Such a display of strategic ineptitude would certainly bring evil consequences for our friends and interests throughout the region and beyond.
If war comes, is there a definable military objective? Here is where the Vietnam analogy does offer a valid lesson. When purposes are clear, means must serve them. If we are forced to military action, we must know that to expel Iraq from Kuwait and to assure the peace in the gulf, we will have to destroy Iraq's capacity to make war.
We should not accept the fallacy that because we want Iraq out of Kuwait, the war should be confined to Kuwait. Nor should we succumb to a war fought by degrees in the belief, as in Vietnam, that a few good men, big ships and loud noises will frighten the culprits.
War, Clemenceau said, is too serious to be left to the generals. By that he meant that military force must be governed by the ends to which it is applied. The Vietnam codicil is that war is also too serious to be left to the politicians. By that I mean that when ends are set, the military forces available must be used in a professional and decisive way.
Thus, the Munich and Vietnam analogies both have application to the gulf but not exactly as many would use them. The Munich analogy teaches us not that Saddam Hussein is already a Hitler but that we must act now to prevent him from becoming one. The Vietnam analogy instructs us not that we should refrain from using force but that if our purposes are just and clear, we should use it decisively.
Perhaps if this is well understood in Washington, it may be understood well enough in Baghdad for Saddam Hussein or someone else to abandon this aggression without war.

HEADLINE: MOMBASA JOURNAL;
A Port Waits With Open Arms for U.S. Sailors

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOMBASA, Kenya, Dec. 6

 BODY:
This muggy port town, which for centuries shipped decorative elephant tusks to maharajahs and rhino horns to keep the sultans in aphrodisiacs, is awaiting the revival of a more modern kind of trade.
Expectancy hangs along the narrow walks of the Arab old town and the wide boulevards of modern Mombasa: When will the sailors from the United States armada now serving in the Persian Gulf alight for rest and recreation? 
 "I've asked the consulate to inform us," said Daniel O. Owino, the manager of Kenya Breweries, who has seen American aircraft carriers come to Mombasa in the past and is relishing the prospects of stepped-up visits because of the gulf crisis.
"The sailors drink a lot of Tusker premium," he said, referring to one of his company's products. Extra bottling capacity has to be arranged at the brewery to accommodate the 1,000 extra cases a day that he said are consumed when the ships come in.
 
The Logical Spot
 Whether the Navy comes to Mombasa is not yet a certainty but seems a good bet.
"Say the gulf situation ended and the Navy was not needed, they would go home," said the United States consul here, Donald E. Stader. "But if they keep the ships up there, people will be rotated through here. I think you can assume we will get ships."
Geographically, Mombasa is the logical spot for the American ships in the gulf to take a reprieve. North of here, where Islamic conservatism prevails, there is nothing with beer and sex. Southward, economically deprived Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and war-torn Maputo in Mozambique do not carry the same appeal.
For the last decade, Washington has had the right to use Mombasa, the biggest port in eastern Africa north of Durban in South Africa, for the support of military operations and for troop rest and recreation. The agreement signed with Kenya in 1980 was based on the idea that military access to Kenya was useful while Iran and Iraq were at war and the Horn of Africa was a theater of the cold war.
But in the last several years, as the strategic importance of Ethiopia and Somalia dwindled and the Iran-Iraq war wound down, ship visits here have dropped, with only one so far this year after a high of 29 visits in 1985. Thus the appetite for more port calls is high, even in the era of AIDS when African women have found American sailors a little more reluctant.
 
Caution Is the Word
 "The ladies come all the way from Zaire to come and enjoy," Mr. Owino said. "The Americans are big spenders. With the AIDS scare, the girls still come, the men entertain them."
But in fact locals said many of the women who have traveled in the last several years by train from Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, and Uganda and Zaire for American ship arrivals have left disappointed. Before shore leave, the sailors are rigorously briefed about the high incidence of AIDS in Africa and its transmission on the continent by heterosexual sex, Mr. Stader said.
The eagerness for ship visits should not leave the impression that Mombasa, which with about 600,000 people is Kenya's second largest city, is hurting. The opposite is the case. Its equatorial heat seasonally air-conditioned by monsoon winds, its pale, fine sands, its easy mix of Arabs and Africans and its rather exotic history have made Mombasa a haven for package-tour holidaymakers from Europe. While a few days of riots in Nairobi in July deterred some safari-going tourists, Mombasa is a world apart from the highlands, savannah and deserts of Kenya. Mombasa hoteliers report their sprawling establishments along the beachfront have been full all year.
 
Still an Islamic Town
 One of the favorite hangouts for the American sailors when they have come in the past, the waterfront Florida Nightclub, where a large seawater swimming pool extends from the red velour-walled disco, is filled these days with German vacationers.
Until the Portuguese arrived in 1497 and Vasco da Gama cast an imperial eye over the town, Mombasa was a thriving Arab center and slave trading port. The Portuguese used the place as a provisioning station for caravels bound for India and built the now-decrepit Fort Jesus to defend the harbor from Arabs sailing in on dhows from the Red Sea. The Omanis pushed the Portuguese out; then finally the British took over. Now about 60 percent of the population is African, about 30 percent Indian and about 10 percent Arab.
Mombasa remains a predominantly Islamic town, with the sight of women in black chadors common. But it is a moderate kind of Islam -- some call it "the old Beirut type of Islam" -- and on a recent day two young women could be seen stripping off their religious cloaks, revealing T-shirts and bare legs, and stepping into the ocean for a cooling dip.
For the United States, the Mombasa consular office has always been a remote war post. It opened in 1915 during World War I, when Washington was the protecting power for German missionaries in the region. A dozen years later, the office closed but reopened for World War II. It shut down again in 1952 and reopened in 1981 as a backstop for the Iran-Iraq war. The nearly 20 United States Navy personnel stationed at the port left in 1988, but with the present situation in the gulf, the recently arrived Mr. Stader said, the American outpost on the African coast is staying in business.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Way of Betting On a '95 Oil Price

BYLINE: By Matthew L. Wald

 BODY:
WHILE the world pays close attention to daily changes in the price of oil, a deeper question for the oil industry and the economy is the long-term outlook for prices. What will a barrel of oil cost in five years, after the Persian Gulf crisis has presumably been resolved and any war damage has been repaired?
A relatively new financial instrument, the Salomon Phibro Oil Trust, represents a sort of popular projection of the 1995 oil price. Four units of the trust represent one barrel of West Texas Intermediate oil -- or, more practically, the price of one barrel -- in September 1995. At that time, Phibro will acquire four million barrels, auction them and split the proceeds among the holders of the 16 million units. 
 When the trust came on the market on Aug. 24, three weeks after Iraq invaded Kuwait, units sold for $4.65 each. On Friday, they closed at $3.25, down 12.5 cents, on the American Stock Exchange.
Philip C. Verleger, the commodities market expert at Charles River Associates, a consulting firm based in Boston, pointed out recently that buyers of the units do not expect a price per barrel of four times the share price (or $13 on Friday); they are expecting a gain, in exchange for the use of their money for the intervening years. Assuming a cost of money of 12 percent, the share price implies a 1995 price in the neighborhood of $24 a barrel. Such a figure, Mr. Verleger said, would be "strikingly low," especially since it represents the price after inflation has taken its toll. Many other oil experts agree, although with global production capacity and inventories rising, a price crash after the crisis is resolved could also be envisioned.
Anyone with a little cash on hand who thinks theprice in mid-decade will be above the mid-$20's could place a bet by buying units of the Phibro trust; if the sale price in 1995 exceeds $24, the buyer's return would exceed 12 percent. An investor who wanted to place the opposite bet, that prices would be even lower, might buy stock in a company that prospers when prices are low, like a refiner and marketer of petroleum products.
In the oil markets, five years is almost forever. In 1981, for example, when oil prices were near record highs after the revolution in Iran, almost no one foresaw the price collapse of 1986. And no one was predicting that year that Iraq would invade Kuwait in 1990, causing oil prices to double in a few weeks.
Before the invasion, oil analysts pointed out that the world's surplus capacity lay almost entirely within OPEC's control and was dwindling as demand rose. This situation was a recipe for significant price increases in the mid-90's, they said.
The chief economist of the Amoco Corporation, Theodore Eck, predicted before the events of the last five months that oil would sell for $25 in the mid-1990's. "I don't see that anything's happened to change that forecast," he said last week.
Independent of Saddam Hussein, he said, the world's largest and third-largest producers (the Soviet Union and the United States) are going through rapid declines in production, and the Persian Gulf (home of the second-largest, Saudi Arabia) still has the great bulk of the known, easy-to-pump oil. "Price is going to continue to be a function of the leading countries in OPEC: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran and Iraq," he said. "Thosefour determine what the price is."
Those countries were successfully raising prices before the invasion, he said. And if the crisis over Kuwait has had any effect, it is to raise the revenue requirements of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq; Iran was already hard pressed for money.
At the First Boston Corporation, William Randol, who follows the oil market and oil stocks, said that the recent price shock had helped slow the economies of various nations, depressing demand, but that overall demand was still growing. He predicted a price above $30. Last month, Texaco Inc. predicted prices rising two to three percentage points above inflation; inflation of 4 percent, Mr. Randol said, would yield a price of $27.75 in 1995.
Norman P. Higby Jr., an analyst in Menlo Park, Calif., laid out a different projection. Saudi Arabia, already a partner with Texaco in a joint venture for refining and marketing that covers the Eastern United States, would expand that effort nationwide and provide gasoline cheaply, to gain market share. Others, he said, would have to follow with low product prices to stay competitive, lowering the value of crude. Prices would be volatile, he said, ranging from $15 to the high $20's or $30.
Thomas R. McHale, an energy economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said he saw China becoming an importer instead of an exporter, and Soviet production falling sharply. Outside the Middle East, he asked, "where else do we have any great potential for expansion of oil production?"
His forecast implies a higher price, but he added that many analysts underestimate the long-term capacity of countries facing higher prices to use less. He would not speculate on a 1995 price.
And the completely unforeseen is always a possibility. At Bear, Stearns & Company, William E. Byers, a futures expert, warned that in oil, copper, soybeans or any commodity, projections made by extrapolating current conditions and inflation rates are seldom accurate. His bottom line on 1995 has a ring of sincerity to it. "I have no clue," he said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Full-Point Cut in Rates Is Urged

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Can the Federal Reserve Board rescue the economy? Many credit market analysts believe it can, but that it will need to push down interest rates by at least a full percentage point, much further than currently forecast.
Over the last two months, as evidence of an economic slowdown grew, the usually cautious Fed has apparently realized that increasingly radical steps may be needed to avert a deep recession. During that span, the central bank lowered the Federal funds rate -- the interest on overnight loans between banks -- three times, to 7.25 percent. It also eliminated a reserve requirement on some commercial bank deposits, which made more money available for lending. 
 The Fed can do more, and probably will. After the extremely weak November employment report on Friday, many economists are expecting that the Fed this week will lower its discount rate, currently at 7 percent, by half a percentage point. The discount rate is what the Fed charges banks for loans. A further drop to 7 percent in the Federal funds rate is also a distinct possibility before the end of the year, they added.
 
Response to Jobs Data
 Last week, credit market participants responded to the employment report and the Fed's easing move by pushing short-term Treasury bill rates to below 7 percent and pushing down yields on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds to 8.14 percent.
But over the next few months, many analysts said, both short- and long-term rates will need to fall another full percentage point in order to turn the economy around.
"We went in to this recession with seemingly neutral interest rates," said Robert J. Barbera, an executive vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers. "We had a bank-induced credit crunch with no rise in interest rates because people changed their minds about what constituted a safe loan. To make lending safe again you will need much lower rates."
The employment report, which showed that 267,000 workers lost jobs last month and that 5.9 percent of the civilian work force was idle, forced economists to recalculate their fourth-quarter growth projections. Based on the first two months of the period, analysts now say the economy could shrink by 2 percent to 5 percent in the quarter.
"My guess is the Fed was shocked by the data," said Alan Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company. "Last week, they seemed aware that we were in a recession, but not one that is as sharp and sweeping as the employment data suggest."
 Pressure of Huge Debt
 The huge amounts of debt accumulated by corporations and consumers during the 1980's -- obligations that crimp profitability and limit future spending -- are a large reason why interest rates may have to fall much further to pull the economy out of recession, the analysts said.
"Can monetary policy stimulate the economy?" Marcos Jones, an economist at the Deutsche Bank Capital Corporation, asked in a weekly letter to clients. "The available evidence suggests that it will not do so quickly, especially if the gradual approach to rate reductions prevails."
Three regional banks responded last week to the Fed's most recent easing move by lowering their prime lending rates by a quarter of a percentage point, to 9.75 percent. But large money-center banks, which lend huge amounts of money based on the prime rate, will probably react much more slowly to the Fed's lead than in the past because their balance sheets are in sorry shape. Now, by keeping the prime rate where it is, these banks will be able to increase profits as their borrowing costs decline.
Moreover, it is doubtful that consumers, who account for two-thirds of all economic activity, are in a position to increase their spending much even when prime-based consumer loan rates do fall, Mr. Jones and other analysts said.
 
Unique Conditions
 In contrast to past downturns, the current recession is beginning with consumer balance sheets that are substantially overleveraged, a decline in housing prices that has eroded household wealth and a slowing in income growth.It will take time, and much lower rates, to reverse those trends, the analysts said.
"The reluctance of banks to extend credit is a new nuance that you have to allow for," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. "And while the consumer malaise perhaps won't get much worse, it is not improving."
Consumers did not do much to pull up the economy in November, economists estimate. Based on most forecasts, retail sales figures expected on Thursday will show that sales dropped by as much as 1 percent last month, compared with a meager one-tenth of a percentage point increase in October.
Aside from the retail sales report, analysts said, signs of much lower inflation should be apparent in November producer price figures, due out Friday.
In advance of the report, the consensus forecast is calling for an increase of about a tenth of a percentage point in the producer price index.
 
Focus on New York
 Attention in the municipal bond market will be focused on New York City. On Wednesday, the city is expected to sell $1.17 billion worth of tax-free and taxable securities, the largest debt offering in the city's history.
In an effort to market the new securities and dispel investor worries about the city's financial prospects, underwriters and city officials held a two-day conference in late November with prospective investors.
Concerns about the future abound, and investors continue to seek haven in higher quality issues. Nevertheless, many market participants said the market premium currently charged for New York City securities, compared with that for other municipalities with a similar debt rate, makes it likely the sale will go well.
Late last week, outstanding New York City issues were offered at a price to yield around 8.6 percent, a full percentage point higher than other A-rated credits.
Ratings of A from Moody's Investors Service Inc. and A- from the Standard & Poor's Coroporation are expected.
"With all the recession talk, the market is in pretty good shape," one municipal-bond trader said. "And with yields on outstanding city paper at those levels, I don't think they will have that big of a problem."

HEADLINE: Cut by Fed In Discount Rate Seen

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
As part of its next step to ease credit conditions, the Federal Reserve Board will probably lower the discount rate, the interest rate that banks pay when they borrow from the central bank.
In interviews last week, Fed officials said a consistent monetary policy would require a reduction of the discount rate, which has remained at 7 percent for almost two years, if the Federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for loans, continues to be driven down by the Fed. 
 "We would be reluctant to move the funds rate under the discount rate," said a top official, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. He reflected current thinking at the central bank that the Fed would lose a dimension of control over interest rates if banks could borrow more cheaply from each other than from the central bank.
 
Threats to the Economy
 On Friday, in recognition of the weakness in the economy, the Fed allowed its target for the Federal funds rate to fall to 7.25 percent from 7.5 percent. It was the third time in the last two months and the fourth time since July that the funds rate had been lowered.
The prevailing view of economists is that the threat of recession has become so serious that further drops in the funds rate are likely soon. This would put more pressure on the Fed to cut the discount rate, a move that would be viewed in the financial markets as a signal of a significant easing of monetary policy.
"The markets would interpret it as a very clear statement of a very aggressive Fed policy," said Robert H. Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank in New York.
 
Full-Point Cut Urged
 Indeed, many credit market analysts believe the Fed will need to push down interest rates even more than currently forecast, possibly by as much as a full percentage point over the next few months, to rescue the economy. [Page D7.]
Almost all current statistics show that the economy has slipped into a recession. The most recent gloomy news came Friday when the Government reported that 267,000 jobs had been lost in November and that the civilian unemployment rate had climbed to 5.9 percent, its highest level in more than three years.
With this year's budget deficit expected to exceed $250 billion, the largest ever, measures like tax cuts and spending increases that have been used to counteract past recessions are virtually out of the question now. This means that encouraging more bank loans, by lowering interest rates, is the only tool the Government has to turn the economy around.
If banks increase their lending, consumers and businesses have more money to spend and invest, and that should lead to economic growth. But changes in interest rates take six to nine months to work their way through the economy. So steps taken by the Federal Reserve now could have little effect on economic conditions in the first half of next year, but they might help by summer.
Eventually, the Fed's actions should make some borrowing less expensive for consumers, lowering the rate for home mortgages and automobile loans, for example. But credit card rates are less influenced by the markets and probably will fall little if it all.
Until last week, the Fed's easing had not affected commercial interest rates; the prime rate remained stuck at 10 percent. But on Friday, a few regional banks reduced this rate, the benchmark for many commercial and personal loans, to 9.75 percent, and others may follow this week.
In addition to cutting the Federal funds rate, the central bank took an unusual step last week to improve bank profits and reduced the amount that banks were required to hold in reserve in cash or interest-free accounts. This was a move to provide banks with more money to lend.
The reserve requirement, the Federal funds rate and the discount rate are the only three elements of the Fed's monetary policy.
 
Symbolic Reduction
 The effect of a reduction in the discount rate would be more symbolic than direct. Few banks now are using the discount window, the term the markets use for borrowing from the central bank, and instead are borrowing from other commercial banks.
Changes in the Federal funds rate are accomplished by the Fed's buying or selling Government securities in the open market, and the change is not announced. But a change in the discount rate must be accompanied by a statement of the central bank's policy and an announcement of the vote by which the Federal Reserve Board decided to act.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, prefers to act discreetly and views a change in the discount rate as a blunt instrument that should be avoided. The rate was last changed in February 1989, when it was raised to 7 percent from 6.5 percent.
Still, if the Federal funds rate comes down further, a step most economists view as inevitable in light of the poor economic conditions, it would probably force the Fed to reduce the discount rate as well.
 
'An Unstable Situation'
 The last time the Federal funds rate dropped below the discount rate was for a brief period in 1980. At the time, Henry C. Wallich, then a member of the Federal Reserve Board and a highly respected economist, said: "When the Federal funds rate falls below the discount rate, there is no clear definition of where the Federal funds rate should be because it's no longer supported by the discount rate. On a given day, it could fall to zero. So if you don't lower the discount rate, you get quite an unstable situation."
Normally, when the discount rate is changed, it is done by at least half a percentage point. Albert M. Wojnilower, a senior economist at the First Boston Corporation, said that if the central bank reduced the rate by a full point, it would be unmistakable evidence of a drastic change in policy.

HEADLINE: Hawkish Coalition Is Forming

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
As President Bush prepares for talks with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq, an unusual coalition of liberal Democrats and moderate-to-conservative Republicans is urging the Administration to make the elimination of Iraq's weapons ability an explicit goal of American policy in the Persian Gulf.
The group, which calls itself the Committee for Peace and Security in the Gulf, has scheduled a news conference on Monday where it plans to argue that the United States should be willing to use force if necessary to see that Iraq's chemical, biological and potential nuclear weapons ability is dismantled or destroyed. 
 Formation of the coalition comes at a time of increasing partisan division over the Administration's conduct of gulf policy, particularly the issue of whether the United States should take military action within the next few months to force Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.
A majority of Congressional Democrats, including such traditional party conservatives as Sam Nunn of Georgia, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, have argued that the Administration should allow more time for economic sanctions to persuade Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, to leave Kuwait voluntarily.
 
Divisions in the Party
 But the willingness of some Democrats to join a coalition that advocates use of force to disarm Mr. Hussein underscores what may be even more significant divisions in the party itself. Members of the new group include prominent liberals like Tony Coelho, the former House Democratic Whip; Ann Lewis, a former political director of the Democratic National Committee, and Representative Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
Among the Republicans are Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; former Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee; former Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci and such vocal Reagan Administration conservatives as Jeane J. Kirkpatrick.
"For someone who has been very vocal in the past about criticizing Administration policy on intervention overseas, I think it is important to speak out when I support it," Mrs. Lewis said. "That is not to say that this is a blanket endorsement of every aspect of Administration strategy."
Richard Perle, a conservative Democrat who served as an Assistant Secretary of Defnese in the Reagan Administration, said the purpose of the coalitin was not to deal with partisan politics.
"The cold war is over, and what constitutes an appropriate position for liberals is going to change," Mr. Perle said.

HEADLINE: Planting a Seed for Trade Wars

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 9

 BODY:
If the European Community does not eventually compromise on the farm trade issue that caused the collapse of the international trade talks here last week, there could be a painful return to the kind of trade warfare that aggravated the economic crises of the 1930's.
 Some officials still hold out hopes that the liberalization effort can be salvaged early next year when governments cool off and take a new look at the impasse over farm subsidies. 
 But for now, the European Community's refusal to dismantle the policies that protect the continent's farmers has paralyzed a four-year effort by 107 nations to expand free-trade initiatives into the 21st century under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the body that regulates world trade.
 
Danger of Unemployment
 The round of talks that failed were the first since World War II to be conducted at a time of such economic weakness. Government officials on both sides of the issue were bound to be far more concerned with the immediate danger of unemployment in their countries than with the promise of future benefits from expanded world trade.
President Bush may again seek to impress upon European leaders the importance the United States attaches to the trade liberalization effort. But American officials make it clear that progress will not come until the Europeans change their position on agriculture and are willing to commit to limitations on their export subsidies.
"We will not be making the telephone calls this time, but rather waiting for others to call us," said Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative.
Europe could choose not to seek a resolution of issues that remain in dispute, acting instead to become predominantly a regional economic and political power. It could adopt ever more adversarial relations with North America, which is in the process of forming its own trade bloc, and with countries of East Asia and the Pacific, where Japan is the pre-eminent economic force.
 
'A Protectionist Era'
 "The dynamics of a protectionist era could be about to begin," said C. Ford Runge, a professor at the University of Minnesota Center for International Food and Agricultural Policy.
In any new world of adversarial blocs and trade wars, the GATT trading system, which has been responsible for a 20-fold increase in trade over four decades, will atrophy.
 So far, there has been little evidence of compromise from the European Community's top leaders.
It had been expected that Chancellor Helmut Kohl, after an election victory in the newly unified Germany, would support the curbs on the community's agricultural subsidies that food exporters outside of Europe had long awaited.
 
German Assertiveness
 But the Germans did not send a high-level delegation to the meeting in Brussels, and officials who were there went out of their way to demonstrate German assertiveness and independence from Washington.
"We are not the 51st state," said Walter Kittel, Secretary of State in the Agriculture Ministry. Otto Schlecht, Secretary of State in the Economics Ministry added, "We are not ready to kowtow."
As the world's third-largest exporter, Germany has much to gain from freer world trade. But rising joblessness is a more immediate worry for Mr. Kohl.
The chancellor also sets high stock in his relationship with President Francois Mitterrand of France, the country that most strongly supports the Europeans' existing farm policy. France is the leading food exporter in Europe, but its farmers receive generous Government support.
 
Little Room to Maneuver
 Mr. Mitterrand has little room to maneuver. His political position has been undermined by student riots in Paris and by violent demonstrations of farmers.
The position supported by the United States in Brussels called for industrialized nations to permit greater access for agricultural and textile products in their markets. In return, developing coutries would open their markets in insurance, banking, accounting, engineering and other services and accept stronger rules against piracy of patents and copyrights.
Under some of the changes contemplated in financial services, for example, a country like Brazil would open its market to foreign insurance companies. Under the intellectual property negotiations, Thailand would be required to take stronger measures against the piracy of American films.
In addition, there would be further cuts in world tariff levels and improved procedures for settling trade disputes.
Essentially what the non-European food-exporting countries want are limits on what this year is expected to be nearly 25,000 tons of subsidized food shipped by Europeans to international markets.
 
Farmers Serve Notice
 While the big food exporters sought access to Europe and other international markets that have been captured by the countries with generous subsidy programs, some 10 million European farmers served notice of the immediate and unpleasant consequences that would reslut if their political leaders gave in to such international demands.
The trade conference started with a demonstration by 30,000 farmers from across the 12-nation European Community, and their message carried through to the final session when European trade negotiators refused to entertain any agricultural proposals acceptable to the United States and other leading food exporters.
The impact of the European farm policies is to depress world prices, hurting not only American farmers but those in Canada, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Indonesia, the Philippines and many other exporting countries.
Despite the breakdown in the final session of the talks, some gains were made.
"Some real good things happened here," said William Brock, a former United States trade representative. "Many developing countries have shown an enormous willingness to be more forthcoming -- from Mexico and Brazil to Thailand and Malaysia. These are really important changes that must be seized upon and responded to."

HEADLINE: Bangladesh Army Chief Ousts Some Commanders

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DHAKA, Bangladesh, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Military officers reported to be loyal to the deposed President, H. M. Ershad, were being moved out of their commands today as the army chief apparently sought to head off any armed intervention in politics, Bangladeshis close to the armed forces said.
In an atmosphere of increasing tension over the fate of Mr. Ershad, who seized power in a 1982 coup and ruled the country until being forced to resign on Dec. 5 under popular pressure, the American Ambassador to Bangladesh, William B. Milam, met today with the army Chief of Staff, Lieut. Gen. Mohammad Noor Uddin Khan. 
 A statement issued by the United States Embassy here afterward said Mr. Milam had praised the army for its "positive and responsible" role in the political crisis that culminated in Mr. Ershad's resignation.
The Ambassador also told the army chief that this attitude would continue.
 
Threat of Aid Loss
 From the beginning of the student-led democracy movement that led to Mr. Ershad's downfall, foreign embassies here have assumed almost mythological importance because of real or perceived messages from diplomats to the Ershad Government implicitly threatening the loss of aid to a country dependent on assistance.
When all newspapers stopped publishing here at the end of November, the Voice of America and the British Broadcasting Corporation news programs became the "bulletin boards" of the protest movement, Bangladeshis of all political opinions say.
Today Mr. Ershad gave his first recent interview, to the B.B.C., in which he said he expected to lead his Jatiya Party into the coming election.
He scoffed at suggestions that he would go into exile. "Why?" he asked the B.B.C. "It's my country. What have I done wrong?"
At the same time, student leaders and others were continuing to call for Mr. Ershad's execution.
Dhaka was awash with rumors today that the military has split in two over the fate of Mr. Ershad, a former general who had a significant enough following in the army to cause alarm among politicians whose main goal is to see that free and fair elections are held here within the next three months.
Helicopters droned overhead this morning as area commanders assembled here for strategy sessions. It was becoming apparent tonight that at least two major intelligence officers who had supported Mr. Ershad were transferred. Questions remained about other units and commanders who might be called on to support a military maneuver on behalf of the deposed President.
Mr. Ershad's fate may split the fragile alliance that stands to gain the most from the fall of his Government.
Today Sheik Hasina Wazed, the leader of the Awami League, Bangladesh's oldest political party, unexpectedly told a group of foreign correspondents that if Mr. Ershad left the country, it would be a relief to Bangladeshis.
Her opponent for more than a decade, Khaleda Zia, leader of the Bangladesh National Party, was today demanding that a special judicial inquiry be set up to try the former President.
 
Caution Is Urged
 Sheik Hasina said the subject of a trial was a "very complicated question." She said that the established legal procedures should take their own course, and that the politicians should move "very cautiously, very calculatedly" to avoid antagonizing the army.
"We shouldn't behave so that with any excuse a military dictator could come again," she said.
Dhaka remained relatively quiet today, with the gap growing between the millions of poor people who want to return to whatever work they can find, and the students roaming the streets with political banners.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
Issue of Job Quotas Sure to Affect Debate on Civil Rights in the 90's

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Few issues reverberate in American politics like race. And not many charges are more serious than accusing a candidate of practicing racial politics.
In recent days, some leading Democrats have been accusing top Republicans, including the next chairman of the Republican National Committee, of doing just that. 
 The subject is quotas: employment policies that, some Republicans charge, unfairly guarantee minority workers or women a certain proportion of jobs. In campaigns in California and North Carolina this year, Republican candidates hammered Democrats as proponents of quotas, charges the Democrats angrily denied.
The issue is expected to be at the heart of the renewed debate over civil rights legislation when Congress returns in January. Democratic leaders say they will quickly reintroduce the civil rights bill that President Bush vetoed this year.
And the prospective Republican National Committee chairman, William J. Bennett, has declared that he considers quotas and affirmative action policies a worthy subject of debate, which, to some Democrats, means that they will be part of the campaign dialogue of 1992.
 Politicians, like generals, are seared by the last war. Much of the heat of this debate stems from the Democrats' experience with Willie Horton, the black convicted murderer and rapist whose case was a focal point of George Bush's 1988 campaign against Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts.
Republicans said they used the Horton case to highlight Mr. Dukakis's liberal crime policies, including the furlough program that put Mr. Horton back on the streets. Democrats said it was a patent appeal to racial fears. The only agreement was on its impact: Willie Horton was devastating to Mr. Dukakis.
Democrats remember, just as they remember the beating they took that year over Mr. Dukakis's veto of a bill requiring schoolchildren to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. The pledge experience made them react in 1989 with great care to the issue of whether a law or a Constitutional amendment would be the best way to ban burning of the flag.
The Horton experience helps frame their response to the quota issue of 1990. It helps explain why Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, chose to lambaste the Republicans in a major speech last week as "seeking a successor to the Willie Horton issue."
Some Democrats say the Republicans are simply seeking another "wedge issue," the term often used for an issue intended to split Democrats from their party. They say that quotas are a classic straw man, since the bill Mr. Bush vetoed explicitly denied any effort "to require or encourage quotas." Republican strategists, the Democrats charge, are simply fomenting an angry new politics of resentment for the recessionary 1990's.
Republican leaders counter that Democrats cry racism because they fear a debate on the merits of some affirmative action policies. "People who want some kind of quota or some kind of set-aside based on your racial background should be forced to debate in public their vision of America," argues Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip. The civil rights bill of 1990 might not have imposed quotas, some Republicans say, but it would have inevitably led to them.
Republican Party leaders bristle at the charge that they are playing racial politics. Mr. Bennett declined to be interviewed last week, but Charles Black, who advised Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina in his successful re-election campaign and who is the chief spokesman for the Republican National Committee, argues that the quota issue is a way of making an ideological -- not a racial -- point.
"The thing about quotas is it reminds people that Democrats are elitist social engineers," Mr. Black said.
But Democrats assert that the racial component was obvious in the way the issue was handled in Mr. Helms's campaign against Harvey Gantt, a black Democrat. A television commercial for Mr. Helms showed white hands crumpling a rejection letter, while an announcer intoned: "You needed that job, and you were the best qualified. But it had to go to a minority because of a racial quota."
 
Comfortable or Not?
 Mr. Gingrich, when asked to assess the commercial at a meeting with reporters this week, said, "I wasn't comfortable or uncomfortable with the ad." He went on to say he had never seen it. When pressed, he said that if he ran such an ad, "I would make clear that I oppose quotas explicitly because I favor an integrated America."
Mr. Bennett, chosen by Mr. Bush last month to serve as the Republican chairman, has a long interest in this issue. In 1979, he wrote a book critical of affirmative action policies called "Counting by Race: Equality from the Founding Fathers to Bakke and Weber." His co-author was Terry Eastland, who went on to become the chief spokesman for the Justice Department in the Reagan Administration.
This debate is likely to intensify as Congress returns to the civil rights bill next year. President Bush based his opposition to the 1990 bill largely on the assertion that it would have led employers to impose hiring and promotion quotas to avoid lawsuits. This argument infuriates backers of the legislation, who say it would simply restore the law to what it was before several recent Supreme Court rulings made discrimination suits harder for plaintiffs to bring and easier for employers to defend.
"This is not a quota bill," said Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. "The Democratic Party opposes quotas, the Republican Party opposes quotas and the leadership conference does not support quotas." Rigid quotas applied without regard to qualifications, he said, are very different from such affirmative action remedies as goals in hiring.
 Moreover, supporters of the legislation say there is a broad bipartisan consensus behind it in Congress, and a broad public consensus. The House approved the measure, 273 to 154, in October, with 34 Republicans voting for it. The measure showed its greatest strength in the Senate when it failed by one vote to get the two-thirds necessary to override President Bush's veto. Eleven Republicans were among the 66 Senators voting to override the veto.
Although some campaigns this year featured attacks on the civil rights measure, Mr. Neas said, "These campaigns were the exceptions to the rule. Progressive Democrats and Republicans campaigned aggressively in support of the civil rights act of 1990, and they were the beneficiary of it."
Still, many Democrats assert that the quotas issue is especially potent when the economy is bad. "What you're talking about basically is the politics of resentment," said Mandy Grunwald, the media consultant for the Gantt campaign.
Some Democrats worry that their party is particularly vulnerable. "A fundamental reason why Democrats are potentially vulnerable to attacks on issues like affirmative action and race quotas is the perception that the Democratic Party has overlooked the needs and values of average Americans," Frederick Yang, an analyst with the polling firm of Peter D. Hart Research Associates, which polls for Democrats, wrote recently in the newsletter "The Polling Report."
Democrats, particularly in the South, often have been dependent on a fragile biracial coalition -- overwhelming black support and enough of the white vote to push them over 50 percent -- for victory in recent years. Such an environment, coupled with the economic downturn and their memories of Willie Horton, make Democrats take the quotas issue very seriously.

HEADLINE: Group Will Buy Mexico's Phone Company

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The Mexican Government said yesterday that it would sell control of its national telephone company to a consortium made up of Grupo Carso of Mexico, the Southwestern Bell Corporation and France Telecom.
The $1.76 billion deal follows a long bidding process, and is among the biggest and most complex transactions in a series of recent sales of telephone companies by governments around the world. The selection of a consortium that includes a large American corporation also signals the Mexican Government's new willingness to open strategic industries to American business interests after seven decades of sometimes open hostility. 
 Southwestern Bell, which has its headquarters in St. Louis, also joins the ranks of regional Bell companies that have made large overseas investments in the expectation of higher profits than they might earn through additional spending on their local telephone networks.
The Mexican Government is selling a 20.4 percent stake in Telefonos de Mexico that carries a majority of the company's voting rights. Also included in the price is an option for Southwestern Bell to buy from the Mexican Government another 5 percent stake in the company, known as Telmex, that carries no voting rights.
Grupo Carso will pay $859.6 million for 10.4 percent of the stock, thereby meeting a stipulation imposed by the Government that Mexican individuals or companies control a majority of the winning consortium. France Telecom will pay $412.2 million for 5 percent, and Southwestern Bell will pay $485.8 million for another 5 percent, plus the 5 percent option.
An all-Mexican consortium, Grupo Gentor, made an unsuccessful $700 million bid for the 10.4 percent stake that Grupo Carso won. Gentor includes the wealthy and influential backers of two of Mexico's biggest conglomerates, Vitro and Grupo Industrial Alfa.
The Mexican Government also turned down a third bid, for $1.69 billion, from a consortium of Accival Casa de Bolsa, a Mexican company; the GTE Corporation, and Telefonica de Espana.
Sixteen companies, including a dozen foreign concerns, were approved by the Mexican Government in October as potential bidders. What prompted such strong international interest was Mexico's fast-growing economy and the strong prospects for expansion in a country with only one local telephone line for every 17 residents. By comparison, the United States has a local telephone line for every two people.
"There is a large pent-up demand for telephone service, and it's just not available," said Royce S. Caldwell, Southwestern Bell's senior vice president for corporate development.
 
Binding Obligation
 The buyers assume a binding obligation to update Mexico's antiquated telephone network, which is notorious for delays of more than a year to install new phone lines. Telmex also lacks adequate local, regional and international trunk lines to handle all the calls.
In Mexico, as in much of Latin America, people still place many long-distance and international calls from the phone company's neighborhood office, handing the desired number to an operator and then waiting on a nearby bench until a connection is made. Upon obtaining a connection, which can take an hour or more in rural areas, the operator sends the caller to a booth and begins timing the call, sometimes with a stopwatch.
Mexican regulators have estimated that Telmex will have to invest $1 billion a year until the late 1990's to meet the service goals set out as part of the company's sale, and that reinvested profits would supply no more than 70 percent of this amount. Service requirements set by the Government include a doubling within four years in the number of household phone lines, to 10 million, and a reduction in installation time to 6 months, from 18.
 
Annual Borrowing to Rise
 Telmex will increase its annual borrowing to pay for the extra investment, and the consortium controlling it will not guarantee the extra debt, Mr. Caldwell said. If Telmex does not reach the service goals, the Government will impose fines that were set as part of the transaction.
Mr. Caldwell said in a telephone interview from Mexico City that Grupo Carso executives called him at home in St. Louis Friday evening and he joined other Southwestern Bell executives the next morning on an American Airlines flight to Mexico to put finishing touches on the deal.
All seven of the regional Bell companies formed by the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1984 are investing abroad. They have taken a particular interest in the state-owned telephone companies now being sold. The governments seek to bring in foreign expertise for their local phone operations and to raise money to pay off foreign debts.
In June, Ameritech, the Bell Atlantic Corporation and two New Zealand companies successfully bid $2.4 billion to buy New Zealand's national phone company. An agreement for Bell Atlantic to buy half of Argentina's telephone company fell through in October.
The BellSouth Corporation, the Nynex Corporation, the Pacific Telesis Group and U S West Inc. all have large stakes in cellular telephone or cable television operations overseas, and Southwestern Bell publishes telephone directories in Australia and Israel.
As many as 25 countries are considering the sale of all or part of their national telephone companies over the next four years, Mr. Caldwell said.
 
Investments Criticized
 Critics have suggested that the regional Bell companies should spend more on high-quality digital switches and high-capacity fiber-optic lines instead of investing abroad. Mr. Caldwell said his company's Mexican venture would not hurt telephone users in the five states -- Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri and Kansas -- that Southwestern Bell now serves. "We will spend whatever amount is necessary to spend in Texas and Oklahoma and our other states to provide the level of service we've always been willing to provide," he added.
Little information on investment banking fees was available late yesterday. Salomon Brothers Inc. advised Southwestern Bell. Wasserstein, Perella & Company advised France Telecom. Grupo Carso, which is involved in mining, paper products, consumer goods and insurance, has its own investment banking arm and did not retain outside advice. Goldman, Sachs & Company and Banco Internacional S.N.V. of Mexico advised the Mexican Government.
The deal came as one of Telmex's most profitable businesses, receiving and distributing calls from the United States, has become part of a growing international dispute.
The United States sends more than twice as many calls to Mexico as it receives, because calls are easier to make from the United States and because Telmex charges several times as much for a call as American carriers.
 
Compensation for Calls
 American carriers paid $534 million to Telmex last year to compensate it for handling the extra calls, more than the combined amount paid to any four other telephone companies around the world. The Federal Communications Commission has been putting pressure on foreign telephone monopolies to reduce the highly profitable fees that they charge for the extra calls, and Mr. Caldwell said the consortium buying Telmex would be likely to do so.
The consortium will also try to raise local telephone rates and lower long-distance and international rates, so that the rates will more closely reflect the cost of providing service, Mr. Caldwell said.
The Mexican Government retains a 36 percent non-voting stake in Telmex. The 5 percent of Telmex for which Southwestern Bell has an option would come out of the Government's stake, Grupo Carso is acquiring an option on a stake of another one-tenth of 1 percent, and the Government has pledged to sell 4 percent to Telmex employees.
The Mexican Government has said that it will sell the rest of its stake in one or more deals over the next several years. The remaining 44 percent is traded on stock exchanges around the world.

HEADLINE: The Hole in Hollywood's Pocket

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
While many American industries are retrenching in the face of a recession, Hollywood is on a spending spree. The studios are paying unprecedented prices for scripts, stars, directors and other talent required to produce feature films.
The theatrical, video and pay television businesses have exploded abroad, setting off bidding wars among the studios for the handful of talent believed to have the greatest global appeal. Artists involved in action films, which consistently play well worldwide, have seen the most spectacular increases.
 
High Industry Benchmarks
And rates like the following are beginning to serve as benchmarks for the entire industry: 
 Arnold Schwarzenegger was paid $10 million for starring in "Total Recall" and will earn $12 million from Carolco Pictures for "The Terminator II."
*"The Godfather, Part III," which stars Al Pacino, will cost Paramount Pictures at least $55 million.
*The screenwriter Shane Black earned less than $750,000 for "Lethal Weapon," one industry executive said, but he received $1.7 million from Warner Brothers for his latest script, "The Last Boy Scout."
*The screenwriter Joe Esterhaus received $3 million for a screenplay for Carolco Pictures' "Basic Instinct," and Irwin Winkler earned $1 million to produce the film, even though both left the project by mutual agreement shortly after production began.
Though there are myriad reasons behind the rise in fees, many Hollywood executives seem to agree that Carolco Pictures, a small Hollywood studio, is partly responsible. In the last few years, Carolco has carved out a niche making big-budget films with international appeal at a time when foreign markets were growing rapidly. It paid actors like Sylvester Stallone, Mr. Schwarzenegger and Mel Gibson enormous fees, recouping its investment by selling the films around the world.
Now, other studios have difficulty hiring these actors for substantially less money, even to appear in films in other genres like comedy that do not travel as well abroad.
And once the fees of actors increase, so do those of the other artists working on their films. Technical experts like cameramen and editors can charge more. "It is an industry where everyone looks at what everyone else makes," said Tom Hansen, an entertainment lawyer at Hansen, Jacobson & Teller in Los Angeles. "That creates a type of momentum."
 
Driving Down Profit Margins
 The escalation in fees is starting to drive down the profit margins of movies. If the trend continues, companies with deep pockets -- like the Sony Corporation, which bought Columbia Pictures last year, and the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, which has agreed to buy MCA Inc. -- are in the best position to pay for talent. But the fear among some executives in the entertainment business is that those companies might only aggravate the problem because they are capable of overspending and are willing to do so if it gives them a competitive edge.
"We are going in for tougher times in the movie business," said David Londoner, a media analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Company. "The competitive bidding war has thrown everything out of wack."
As one top executive at a major studio put it: "It's like a herd of elephants going down Main Street with each one's trunk hooked into the next one's tail. What they don't know is that the lead elephant is blind and has no idea what he's doing."
 
Changing Hollywood's Economics
 Higher costs are indeed changing Hollywood's economics. Last year, production costs for an average film rose 30 percent, to $23.5 million, while advertising costs jumped 10 percent, to $7.8 million.
One industry executive, who insisted on not being named, estimated that production costs have continued to grow this year, but not as strikingly as in 1989, while advertising costs have shot up much more sharply as studios have looked to protect their heavy investments in production.
Peter Dekom, a leading Hollywood lawyer and a partner at Bloom Dekom & Hergott, said he believed that the rates of return for films had already declined this year. And Mr. Londoner said he believed that the average profit margin of studios could fall 20 percent in the next few years, to about 9 percent.
 
Artists Demand Pay Up Front
 Eroding profitability has not been lost on actors and producers. Rather than settling for a modest advance and a cut of the profits, more artists have started demanding all of their pay up front -- an arrangement that further diminishes studios' profit potential. "No one is willing to gamble on real profits coming from these movies," said Dale Pollock, president at A& M Films, a production company owned by Polygram. "So most talent wants its money first."
An independent film producer, Lee Rich, said that "when stars get more, an Oscar-nominated cinematographer who earned $6,000 a week two years ago may make close to $12,000 today."
The problem is compounded when studios feel compelled to spend more to promote the films to increase the chances that their investment will pay off. The Walt Disney Company, for example, spent $46 million to make "Dick Tracy" and $54 million to promote it. Historically, studios have spent about one-fourth of their total budget on advertising.
Studios, of course, might keep a lid on their costs by staying out of the action film and big-budget categories. The trouble, said Tom Pollock, the chairman of Universal, is that these movies are "the big locomotives that drive the other films." He continued, "You get better terms from your theater owners if you can offer them such films."
 
Effect of Foreign Financing
 Foreign investors have helped provide financing for this spending frenzy. At Columbia Pictures, for example, Sony has put in place the particularly aggressive management team of Jon Peters and Peter Guber, who produced high-budget films like "Batman" for Warner Brothers. Eager for a big hit to give their new studio an aura of success, the team reportedly paid unprecedented prices for talent to make "Hook," a new film based on the pirate captain in "Peter Pan."
Studios rarely pay principals more than 30 percent of a film's proceeds, movie industry executives said. But Columbia is reportedly paying the director Steven Spielberg and the actors Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams a total of 40 percent of all the money "Hook" takes in.
"Up until Columbia got into the fray, we argued that Carolco could pay Sylvester Stallone $12 million, but we could offer $7 million and say that a star was likely to make more money from a film's profits because we could distribute it better," said one executive who insisted on not being identified. "Columbia has made it harder for us to make that argument."
Mr. Guber, Mr. Peters and Columbia declined to comment.
 
Spending as a Measure of Success
 At some level, the ability to spend has itself become a measure of success. Largo Entertainment, an independent production company, recently attracted Japanese financing, permitting it to pay top dollar for actors and directors. In describing the ability of Largo's president, Larry Gordon, to make high-budget films, one entertainment lawyer said, "Larry can really play with the big boys."
Some studios can more easily justify paying higher prices for talent these days because, with the consolidation of the media industry and the rise of integrated entertainment conglomerates that distribute movies, books, recordings, television programming and magazines, they have more outlets through which to recoup their investments.
For example, the box office success of "Presumed Innocent," based on Scott Turow's best-selling book and released by Warner Brothers last summer, may have helped stimulate paperback sales of the book and of "The Burden of Proof," the author's second novel. Both books were published by Time Warner's book division.
Sometimes studio executives may believe there are indirect benefits from spending heavily to give a film high visibility. For Disney, the high cost of "Dick Tracy" may have reduced profit margins, but the movie's box-office revenues made the studio the industry leader in market share for the summer, a factor that one executive at a rival studio said helped persuade a group of Japanese institutional investors to invest $600 million in Disney.
 
Indications of Disenchantment
 Already, some industry executives say they are undertaking cost control measures. Many of them were spooked this summer when a glut of action films eroded the profitability of individual releases, and audiences, perhaps tiring of the format, gravitated toward films like Paramount Pictures' "Ghost," Disney's "Pretty Woman" and New Line Cinema's "Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles." Despite their relatively low budgets, the three are the highest-grossing films of the year.
Frank Mancuso, the chairman of Paramount Pictures, said his studio was moving away from high-budget films. "Now that everyone is doing it, we don't want to," he said.
In an indication of this disenchantment, Paramount recently broke its production deal with the producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, who had produced a series of expensive hits but, more recently, some disappointments, including "Days of Thunder."
But the results of any spending cuts may not show up for several years. Budgets have been set for films that will be produced this year and next. But their costs will not be capitalized until the films are released, and that will not be for two years or so.

HEADLINE: Suspense for News as Tribune Board Meets

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT

 BODY:
With The Daily News still hemorrhaging money on the 46th day of a bitter strike, there is an air of suspense about what might happen at tomorrow's quarterly board meeting of the newspaper's corporate parent, the Tribune Company of Chicago.
The strike, which erupted on Oct. 25 after 10 months of fruitless contract talks, has taken a great financial toll on the otherwise robust company, far more than the tens of millions of dollars Tribune executives say they anticipated when they began girding for a climactic clash with their New York City unions nearly a year ago. 
 As a result, some Wall Street investment analysts have speculated that the TribuneCompany's 14-member board might well decide tomorrow to cut the company's losses and close the paper.
In the last week, union leaders had eagerly seized on this notion, hoping that the specter of a shutdown would help force a settlement favorable to them, or possibly a sale of the paper.
 
Tough Management Style
 Those hopes seemed buoyed by the announcement last week of plans for a meeting in Washington at the invitation of the Federal Government's top labor mediator.
In many ways, a shutdown of The News, a fixture on the New York newspaper scene for 71 years, would be consistent with the pragmatic, hard-nosed management styleof the parent company and its combative chief executive, Charles T. Brumback, who took over that post four months ago.
But several Tribune officials familiar with Mr. Brumback's long-range strategy said that while he had underestimated the costs of the strike -- especially the extent to which violence, intimidation and pro-union sentiments would cut into circulation -- the company decided long ago to wage a war of attrition with the unions in which it was prepared to gamble many millions of dollars.
This view -- which several company officials offered in recent days on condition of anonymity -- suggests that the fate of the paper might not be decided until mid-1991, and would hinge on two factors: the success of the publisher, James Hoge, in bringing circulation and advertising at least back to the break-even point, and revenue projections for the fourth quarter of 1991.
"Charlie Brumback has always looked at this thing in long-range terms," a Tribune Company official familiar with Mr. Brumback's thinking said on Friday.
The company, he said, had maintained the same "hard-nosed position" at the bargaining table since the beginning of the year. "The unions don't like it and they've tested us as much as anybody's been tested," he said. "But that's not the question. The question is, who's got the staying power?"
For the moment, the company's record of success in the strike has been mixed. Although The News has continued to publish, and for less than half of its pre-strike labor costs, its circulation -- sustained by a ragtag force of hawkers and private home-subscription contractors -- has fallen to less than half its pre-strike level of 1.09 million copies a day. Most of its major advertisers have fled.
These losses, combined with more than $25 million management is believed to have spent on strike-related costs like security, legal expenses and pre-strike preparations, could raise the tide of red ink at the paper to close to $100 million for the year, many outside financial analysts believe.
 
Union Publicity Effort
 At the same time, union leaders -- whom The News recently sued for $150 million, accusing them of conspiring to terrorize vendors and nonunion workers -- have gained the sympathy of many local political and religious leaders, including John Cardinal O'Connor, head of the New York Archdiocese.
The Cardinal, who has sharply criticized The News's use of permanent replacement workers and what he has called its exploitation of homeless people in its hawker program, is scheduled to join the Rev. Jesse Jackson today at a pro-union rally outside News headquarters on East 42d Street. And tomorrow, Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, has scheduled a one-day labor subcommittee hearing in Manhattan to discuss the practice of hiring permanent replacement workers to break strikes.
If the Tribune Company decides to close The News and attribute it to the unions, the shutdown could be accomplished for perhaps $150 million, including pension liability and other benefits, outside newspaper investment analysts say.
 
Waiting Till Spring?
 But there is wide agreement on Wall Street that the stock of the tightly managed, $2.4 billion Tribune Company will prosper in the long run whether The News survives or not. Indeed, company stock, down since last year, has been on the rise since the strike began.
One possibility, a financial analyst at the Tribune Company said, is that the board will put off a decision on The News's fate until spring, just before the annual company meeting in April. The crucial factors then, he suggested, would be the price of Tribune Company stock at that time, and whether Mr. Hoge has managed to bring The News to a break-even point by luring back enough advertisers and achieving a "provable" paid circulation of perhaps 575,000 copies a day.
"Their general view is that if they see progress at The News, they'll stick with it," the Tribune analyst said. "They think they they can outlast people who have to buy Christmas presents for their kids."
If all goes well over the coming months -- a big "if," the analyst acknowledged -- Mr. Brumback would ultimately announce a $300 million plan to build a new printing plant equipped with color presses, a production feature considered essential to The News's survival.
 
Accepting Big Losses
 Asked about the likelihood of that series of events, Joseph A. Hayes, the Tribune Company's vice president for corporate affairs, and John T. Sloan, The News's chief spokesman, declined to comment, other than to reaffirm that the company was committed to remaining in New York.
But the Tribune analyst said he believed that a huge financial loss at The News this year is unlikely to faze Mr. Brumback or his top associates.
"I think they're willing to accept a $100 million loss without batting an eye," the analyst said. "The Tribune Company has written off the fourth quarter for this year -- they've just written it off. The thinking is that if they're going to take a hit, now's the time to do it because we're going into recession."
Noting that the company's stock has been rising, the Tribune Company official familiar with Mr. Brumback's thinking said, "I don't think the investors want to see us cutting and running just yet."

HEADLINE: How a 9-Year-Old Boy Rode A Dark Horse to Success

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 9

 BODY:
The star of the movie is a mere lad of 9, and the story line has been criticized as implausible and excessively sentimental. But "Home Alone" has overcome those obstacles and others, becoming the first blockbuster hit of the holiday film season and making its young leading man an instant favorite of American children and a potential millionaire.
Playing Kevin McCallister, who is accidentally left behind when his parents, four siblings and many assorted relatives leave for Paris from their home in suburban Chicago on a Christmas vacation, young Macaulay Culkin lives out a universal childhood fantasy. He gorges on ice cream, stays up late watching television and fends off a pair of bumbling burglars, a comedic formula that has proved immensely alluring to the young and not-so-young. 
 Released in mid-November by 20th Century Fox, "Home Alone" has already earned $80 million. With many moviegoers returning to theaters with friends or family members to see the comedy three or four times, the movie is expected by many in the film industry to gross $100 million by Christmas and to end up with a total box office take of $150 million or more, making it a sleeper hit almost in a class with "Ghost," the most successful movie of 1990, with receipts of $200 million.
 
Where Concept Prevails
 "We weren't on anybody's list of upcoming films for the holiday, not even in the longshot dark-horse column," said John Hughes, who produced and wrote the movie. "But I felt that the concept, the idea of a kid taking care of himself, was the most important thing."
The runaway success of "Home Alone" comes as especially welcome news to Rupert Murdoch and his News Corporation, the parent company of 20th Century Fox. Having spent hundreds of millions of dollars to set up a fourth television network even as it was expanding into newspapers, book publishing and magazines, the News Corporation finds that the revenue it needs to stay afloat is smaller than expected because of a worldwide economic downturn.
Mr. Murdoch has been trying to negotiate an agreement with his creditors to defer repayment of about $5 billion in debt due in the next three years. With that in mind, "Home Alone" comes as a windfall that reduces some mounting financial pressure.
 
A Falling Out
 Originally, Mr. Hughes was planning to make "Home Alone" for Warner Brothers. That studio, though, pulled out just before filming was to begin in a disagreement over production costs, which Mr. Hughes estimated came to $18 million.
"We were three weeks away from the start, and it was a question of the budget," Mr. Hughes said in a telephone interview from Chicago, where he is directing a movie called "Curly Sue" for Warner Brothers. "To me, this was always an A picture, and I didn't want to see it treated as a B kiddie title."
Many of the 18 films Mr. Hughes has directed, produced or written in the last seven years, including the hits "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," "The Breakfast Club" and "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," were made for Paramount Pictures or Universal Studios. But Joe Roth, the head of movie operations for 20th Century Fox, had told Mr. Hughes early on that he would be happy to take on "Home Alone" if it ran into problems with Warner Brothers, Mr. Hughes said.
"I knew I had to go somewhere where I could get it made right away," Mr. Hughes said. "I had a cast and crew that were waiting and didn't know what was going on."
 
Timing, Timing, Timing
 The success of "Home Alone" also demonstrates the importance of knowing the right time to release a movie. 20th Century Fox had intended to open "Home Alone" on Thanksgiving weekend, but changed its plans when it was announced that Disney's "Three Men and a Little Lady," a sequel to the 1987 hit "Three Men and a Baby," would do the same.
"When 'Three Men' moved into that slot, we knew there was no way we could possibly compete head to head," said Tom Sherak, head of marketing at 20th Century Fox. "We decided to move everything up a week."
By doing so, "Home Alone" opened against Sylvester Stallone's "Rocky V" on Nov. 16 and racked up $17 million, a record gross for a nonholiday fall weekend. A sneak preview at about 1,000 theaters the weekend before the official release date was also said to be essential to the strategy: 5 percent of the preview audience members came to see the movie again on the opening weekend with friends, which convinced studio executives that they had a smash hit.
With that strong opening, "Home Alone," which received mixed critical reviews, was able to hold off "Three Men and a Little Lady" when it opened. Though "Three Men" earned a strong $13.8 million in its opening weekend, the box office take for "Home Alone" for the same period rose 23 percent, to a remarkable $21 million.
 
The Film That Wouldn't Leave
 "Home Alone" promises to further complicate a holiday film release schedule that is already one of the most crowded in recent years. The 1,300 theaters that had expected "Home Alone" to play for 3 or 4 weeks are now looking forward to a run of 10 to 12 weeks; these theaters are to be joined by 700 others by Christmas, which may make it even more difficult for other films to find a perch.
Studio executives are also waiting to see if "Home Alone" will siphon business away from a pair of comedies that have story lines relying on children and that are expected to be hits. "Kindergarten Cop," starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a detective who goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher, and "Looking Who's Talking Too," with the voices of Bruce Willis and Roseanne Barr in a sequel to the 1989 hit that grossed $140 million, are to open this month.
"Home Alone" is rated PG, which means not only that children who are the age of its star and even younger may see the movie, but also that Fox can advertise it on Saturday morning cartoon programs catering to that audience. In contrast, both "Kindergarten Cop" and "Look Who's Talking Too" carry a more restrictive PG-13 rating, limiting their ability to advertise to children.
One early beneficiary of the movie's success is its star, who by appealing to adults and children and showing the ability to carry a film has suddenly become a hot property.
 
Alone at Home Again?
 He is reportedly to receive $1 million for his next film, "I Am Woman." Mr. Hughes added that "a sequel about the next chapter in Kevin's life makes sense creatively" and that he and 20th Century Fox are discussing the possibility. He also acknowledged that the child, whose contract does not oblige him to appear in a sequel, stands to make a lot more money the second time around. His salary for acting in "Home Alone" was reportedly in the low six figures.
"It's phenomenal that we're talking about these numbers in connection with a 10-year-old boy," Paul Feldsher, Macaulay Culkin's agent said of this Manhattan fifth grader who has been acting since he was 4 years old. "But when you look at the commerce of it all, it makes perfect sense. He's an actor in a hit film, and everyone associated with a hit picture tends to do better the next time around."

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
Will There Be War?

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
President Bush insists that there can be no negotiation with Iraq and that the threat of war remains high. When Saddam Hussein decided to release his hostages, Mr. Bush said a peaceful solution was no closer. With Americans out of the way, he said, it would in fact be easier to make war on Iraq.
But negotiation has already started. There is every reason to think it will go on. And that makes war distinctly less likely. 
 Think about Secretary of State Baker's meeting with Saddam Hussein in Baghdad, whenever it is finally scheduled. Is Mr. Baker going to come back saying the meeting was a total failure? That war is now the only option?
If Saddam Hussein were intransigent, refusing to talk about withdrawal from Kuwait, then Mr. Baker might well come back with such a message. And President Bush would then have more public support for war.
But the Iraqi dictator knows all that. He has already shown that he can read American feelings and can move to avoid danger to himself. One reason he decided to release the hostages was surely to remove one casus belli. In meeting Mr. Baker he will be quite aware that to avoid war he has to give ground on Kuwait.
It seems to me likely, therefore, that Saddam Hussein will tell Secretary Baker that Iraq is withdrawing from Kuwait -- but that he needs assurances on some points. For example, he could announce a withdrawal in stages:
"Stage one has already begun, Mr. Secretary. Our troops began pulling out at 5 this morning. But it will take time, and there are security problems. Before finally leaving, we need to know when American forces will leave Saudi Arabia, who will maintain security in Kuwait and when sanctions on us will end."
If Saddam Hussein makes that kind of statement, is Mr. Baker going to refuse a discussion? Is he going to come out of the meeting and say that Iraq has not met the demand for unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait so there must be war?
The truth is that there would not be much American support for a war in such a scenario. Nor would there be much if Saddam Hussein did what many think he may do: withdraw from all of Kuwait except two islands at Iraq's outlet to the Persian Gulf and Kuwait's portion of a disputed oilfield.
Secretary Baker was asked yesterday on the ABC News program "This Week With David Brinkley" whether it would be credible to threaten war over the islands and oilfield. He answered yes, "to say anything else would be to reward an aggressor."
But the real world is not like that, and Mr. Baker knows it. Americans are deeply divided over the possibility of war with Iraq as it is. Can one imagine President Bush trying to take the country into war over the islands and oilfield?
There are other ways to deal with the border questions. The United Nations could keep sanctions on Iraq's oil exports until its withdrawal was complete. Or the border issues could be put, by mutual consent, to a legal tribunal of some kind.
Those are matters for diplomacy, and of course there will be diplomacy -- not just Mr. Baker looking Saddam Hussein in the eye and delivering an ultimatum. In fact the diplomacy has started. Last week Mr. Baker gave assurance that American forces would not attack Iraq if it left Kuwait. This week he emphasized that Iraq and Kuwait can discuss their differences, on such issues as the border, after Iraqi withdrawal.
"We are already involved in the negotiation process," former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance told The Boston Globe.
Mr. Vance called for an international conference on the Middle East to discuss security arrangements for the region after this crisis ends. He said it should consider, among other things, Iraq's nuclear capacity, arms sales to all countries in the region and the Palestinian question.
The conference idea is a prickly one for the Bush Administration because of Israeli objections to international consideration of the Palestinian question. But the United States has a strong interest in reducing instability in the Middle East, and Mr. Baker has already said that security must be dealt with after the crisis. If the promise of a future conference would help to end the crisis, would Americans prefer war?
President Bush no doubt feels he must keep the pressure on by making warlike noises. But if Iraq does withdraw, even with conditions, he will surely want to give priority to rebuilding Kuwait -- and leave the rest to diplomacy.

HEADLINE: Regulate Banks: Less, and More

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has put forth a seemingly crazy idea: sweeping deregulation of commercial banks. The last time Washington set out to deregulate financial institutions, it brought on the monumental savings and loan scandal.
But in fact there's nothing crazy about the Administration's bank plan. It is prudent and courageous. Prudent because current regulations make banks financially shaky and unable to survive foreign competition. Courageous because the Administration is sure to be ridiculed by members of Congress quick to stir up distaste for anything that smacks of another S.& L. bailout.
 
 Two laws, each more than 50 years old, stifle commercial banks. The McFadden-Douglas Act prevents banks from opening branches across the nation. And the Glass-Steagall Act forbids banks to underwrite and trade securities. Both laws are supposed to keep banks safe. In fact, they do the opposite.
The key to lowering financial risk is diversification: by investing in many different regions, industries and financial instruments, banks could insulate themselves. By forbidding such diversification, the two laws destabilize bank earnings.
A glaring example is the fate of S.& L.'s in the Southwest, dragged down by the collapse of the real estate market. If they had been allowed to operate branches in thriving Northwest states and not been forced to invest so heavily in real estate, they would still be alive.
The banking laws create another mortal problem. U.S. banks are losing customers to foreign banks which are permitted to offer a panoply of services, ranging from insurance to securities trading. Deregulation is necessary for American banks to survive. But it cannot proceed until Congress makes sure that failing banks can't gamble with federally insured deposits. That's what created the S.& L. debacle, and it remains possible under current law.
The Treasury Department is reviewing several promising options. The essential ingredients are clear. First, the Government needs to set high capital standards, above current levels. Next, as bank losses mount -- and capital slips below specified targets -- regulators would be required to intervene. Failing banks would be prevented from extending new loans, paying dividends or otherwise squandering funds needed to reimburse depositors.
Mandatory intervention was missing during the 1980's as bankrupt S.& L.'s were permitted to get deeper and deeper into trouble. What Congress ought to have learned from that searing episode is that the response cannot be left to the discretion of politically sensitive regulators.
Even if Congress agrees to these safeguards, many details must be resolved. The Treasury Department is grappling with proposals to improve accounting standards, introduce risk-adjusted fees for deposit insurance and set up barriers against misuse of federally insured deposits.
Beyond such details, the overriding need is to free U.S. banks to diversify investments and compete against foreign rivals. Economists have shown this can be done without endangering the taxpayer. Now the Administration has wisely turned policy into proposals. Congress would be wise to accept.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Senate Leader in Albany Is Showing New Swagger

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Ralph J. Marino, the Republican majority leader of the State Senate, is not known for making bold statements. He can exasperate Democratic leaders by revealing so little about a negotiating position that they question whether he has one. Reporters jockey to shove their tape recorders close to his mouth so they can catch his virtually inaudible utterances.
But in the wake of an impressive victory for the Republican majority in the Senate in the Nov. 6 election, his words, if not his voice, have resounded with uncharacteristicbravado. "The Marino era," he mumbled in a recent interview, "has begun." 
The statement served as both a declaration and a confession. Mr. Marino, a Nassau County lawyer, has been the majority leader for two years. But only now is he feeling confident enough to exert the power wielded by his venerable predecessor, Warren M. Anderson of Binghamton.
 
'Marino's Maulers'
 His new swagger stems from his ability to expand his Republican majority despite the most vigorous Democratic effort in decades to loosen the Republicans' 25-year grip on the Senate. Republican Senators returned toAlbany last week sporting lapel buttons that declared themselves "Marino's Maulers."
Beginning in January, the Republicans will control 35 of the 61 seats in the Senate. The party's majority during this year's legislative session was 34, but two Republican Senators were struggling with fatal illnesses and could not be relied on to make it to Albany. Mr. Marino had to count noses before every vote.
Not only did the Republicans increase their majority, but they also did it by running determinedly against tax increases and the fiscal policies of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. Significantly for the future of state politics, Mr. Marino now feels that he hasbeen handed a mandate.
Perhaps seeing the writing on the wall, Mr. Cuomo proposed shortly before Election Day to fill a $1 billion gap in the current state budget purely by cutting spending without raising taxes.
 
'Too Much Spending'
 "We in the Republican Senate have proven the case that there was too much spending in New York State, and the Governor now is trying to get in the mainstream with us," Mr. Marino said. "As long as he does that, we'll get along just fine. But if there's an effort to go back to the old ways, if there's more spending, everyone will hear from me very clearly, for a change."
The state's leading Democrats, Mr. Cuomo and Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, argue that such posturing is more than a bit disingenuous.
After all, the 62-year-old Mr. Marino has not yet sworn to oppose tax increases in next year's budget, which could have a $3 billion gap. And Mr. Marino was a partner with Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Miller in negotiating this year's budget agreement, which included the largest tax increase in state history.
Whatever happened in the past, Mr. Marino and members of his Republican conference in the Senate said the election results have given them new resolve to resist tax increases. "I feel bolstered by it, I feel energized by it," Mr. Marino said.
 
Opposition to Payroll Tax
 The Senate leader has become more assertive in other matters as well. He was quick to oppose the payroll tax proposed by Mayor David N. Dinkins to finance an ambitious anti-crime package for New York City, sending Mr. Dinkins and the City Council back to the drawing board.
And after his party was embarrassed by the gubernatorial candidacy of Pierre A. Rinfret, who leveled blistering attacks on the Senate Republicans, Mr. Marino suggested bluntly that the state Republican chairman, J. Patrick Barrett, should step down.
Some Republicans believe that Mr. Marino is now positioned to become a party leader whose influence could rival that of his close political associate, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
The majority leader, who keeps a jar of elephant-shaped animal crackers on his desk, is more conservative than the Rockefeller wing of the state Republican Party but is less ideologically zealous than many upstate legislators. For instance, he has voted in favor of abortion rights but against Medicaid financing of abortions.
 
'Control Is Important'
 Both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Miller said they did not expect to see much change this year in Mr. Marino's low-key style. But they do think he will be a more dominant force in controlling his own Republican conference.
"That will be helpful to Ralph and to all of us because control is important to the way we work," Mr. Cuomo said. "One of the problems with Ralph in his first year was that he couldn't deliver his conference. It made us hostage to all the disparate points of view and that made it hard to govern."
Mr. Marino said he proved he could deliver votes in his first year as majority leader, when he pushed through a budget agreement that included $1 billion in tax increases. But for reasons he said he could not understand, the perception has lingered that he is led by the State Senate's Republican members.
That impression may have been created by the way Mr. Marino won the majority leader's job in 1988. To tap the resentment of legislators who were weary of Mr. Anderson's autocratic style, Mr. Marino promised greater democracy in his house.
But the perception has also been advanced by Mr. Marino's personality. He is so reserved that he is often misjudged as a pushover.
"It's always extraordinary to me how little he gets away with saying," said Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine. "We're never able to flush out his position."
In a now legendary negotiating session on the state budget last spring, Mr. Cuomo orally pummeled Mr. Marino almost until sunrise. The Senator offended the sensibilities of some of his colleagues by doing little to defend himself against the abuse. But he also refused to cave in to the Democrats' demands.
 
'He Can Dig In'
 "The fact that he's quiet does not mean he's not resolute," Mr. Miller, the Assembly Speaker, said. "He can dig in and really be tough without raising his voice."
Mr. Marino's political instincts were steeled in the rough-and-tumble world of Nassau County Republican politics. A Rochester native whose parents were tailors, he moved to his wife's home in Oyster Bay after graduating from Syracuse University and Fordham Law School.
He served on the school board and town board and lost an election for town supervisor before winning election to the Senate in 1968. There, he developed an interest in criminal-justice issues, serving as chairman of the Committee on Crime and Correction for more than a decade.
Those skeptical of Mr. Marino's abilities point out that he remains a relative novice on the state budget, which is expected to dominate the action in Albany during the next two years.
"He doesn't like this stuff," said one legislative aide. "On the whole, he's probably going to swallow whatever is handed out."
Mr. Marino said that was not so. In the Marino era, he said, the Senate will be less reactive to the Governor's initiatives. "This gives me an opportunity to become a little more positive, a little more creative," he said. "We'll be laying out our own agenda."

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
Iran's Leader Uses Gulf Crisis to Consolidate Power and Reduce Isolation

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Taking advantage of the Persian Gulf crisis, President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran has isolated the radical foes of his policies, improved relations with Arab governments in the gulf and expanded political and economic ties with Western Europe.
Throughout the crisis Iran has tried a balancing act, condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the American military presence in the region. 
 It has largely adhered to the international embargo against Iraq -- although there is smuggling of food and other goods across the border -- while vigorously pursuing peace talks with Baghdad to resolve issues remaining from the war the two countries fought from 1980 to 1988. Soon after the United States and its allies sent large forces to Saudi Arabia to confront Iraq, Baghdad agreed to make peace with Iran, largely on Teheran's terms. The two nations agreed to withdraw their forces from conquered territory and exchange prisoners.
 
'The Second Republic'
 The country is now entering what one Saudi official calls "the second republic" under the stewardship of President Rafsanjani. After the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini two years ago, Iran seems in the view of many Iranian affairs experts to look upon the crisis as an opportunity to signal the world that the President's pragmatic policies are becoming firmly established, replacing the country's decade-long militancy and isolation.
Internally, President Rafsanjani has teamed up with Iran's Shiite Muslim spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a steady campaign to drastically reduce the influence of important opponents, including the former Interior Minister, Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, and Ayatollah Sadegh Khalkhali, a member of Parliament who was known as "the hanging judge" when he headed the country's revolutionary courts under Ayatollah Khomeini.
Mr. Rafsanjani's foes are being removed from policy making positions from which they inveighed against President Rafsanjani's declared intentions to attract foreign capital and improve ties with the West.
President Rafsanjani's professed intentions to revive and privatize the economy have been helped by an impressive increase in oil revenues. As oil prices soared, several Iranian oil experts predicted that the country's oil income would be nearly $20 billion this year, an increase of almost $7 billion over pre-crisis calculations.
 
Hostages and Frozen Funds
 In the realm of foreign policy there are no indications of an imminent improvement of Iranian-American relations, which hinge on the fate of the American hostages still held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian militias and a settlement of Iran's claims to $10 billion in funds frozen in American banks. After an initial effort earlier this year by Iran, which resulted in the release of three American hostages, progress on these issues seems to have stopped and is unlikely to resume before the gulf crisis ends, Arab diplomats here say.
But Iranian diplomacy has quietly succeeded in getting the European Community to lift all economic sanctions in October and encouraged Britain to resume diplomatic ties.
These moves are attracting Western financial aid and investment, most notably from France, whose companies have started work on rebuilding Iran's main oil shipping terminal at Kharg Island. The French Peugot company recently concluded a deal to assemble cars in Teheran.
"It is clear that the growing consensus around the country is to put the economic house in order and get Iranian money and expertise abroad to come back home," said Shireen T. Hunter, deputy director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
Within the gulf region, Iran is in the midst of an intensive diplomatic campaign to repair its relations with Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, ties that were damaged by those countries' support of Iraq in the eight-year war with Iran.
"Before the crisis all the gulf states were aligned with Iraq," said Shahram Chubin, a political analyst with the Strategic Studies Center in Geneva. "Now that Iraq is the major threat to all of them, Iran is emerging as a natural counterweight."
 
Regional Security System
 Speaking at a news conference here on Friday, the Iranian Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, confirmed this notion by hinting that Iran had discussed with several Arab countries in the gulf the idea of setting up "a regional security system" to prevent a recurrence of episodes such as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the arrival of foreign troops, adding that the proposal has met with "positive signals."
Just before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, Iran had resumed diplomatic relations with that country. And over the last two months, Saudi and Iranian envoys have exchanged visits to resolve the thorny issue of the pilgrimage of Iranian Muslims to Mecca, which has been suspended for three years since clashes with Saudi security forces in which 400 Iranians died.
Inside Iran, the most significant developments in the last few months took place in October, when several Iranian leaders teamed up in a cunning maneuver to marginalize opponents.
President Rafsanjani, with the support of Ayatollah Khamenei, swiftly eliminated four of his most hard-line adversaries from the political scene by challenging their right to re-election to the Council of Experts on the grounds that they were not sufficiently knowledgeable in Islamic jurisprudence. The council passes judgment on all laws and on appointments of senior Government officials.
 
A Humiliating Test
 The militants who were disqualified after failing to pass a humiliating examination on Islamic law included the Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Mehdi Karrubi, and a former State Prosecutor, Mohammad Mussawi Khoeniha, as well as Mr. Mohtashemi and Ayatollah Khalkhali.
President Rafsanjani has made attempts to widen the scale of public tolerance at the expense of hard-liners.
A week ago the President, who holds the religious rank of hojatolislam, called for greater sexual permissiveness, invoking the existing right in Islam of "temporary marriages," which could last as little as a day, for young men and widowed or divorced women, in order "to clear the path for intrinsic needs of the youth to be satisfied in a correct, legal and orderly manner."
Religious hard-liners struck back with demonstrations demanding greater vigilance in public morality. The episode recalls several instances in which Mr. Rafsanjani floated proposals to allow women to wear makeup and encourage the return of music and singing, stirring hard-line opposition.
 
Little Help for Iraq
 Mr. Rafsanjani and Ayatollah Khamenei seem to have decided that while they will continue to talk peace with Iraq, they will not help it in any substantial way to break the embargo.
According to several officials of Arab gulf nations, Iran has turned a blind eye to the smuggling of sheep into Iraq. But these infractions of the embargo by Iran "are nothing major," in the words of one Arab Cabinet officer in the gulf who spoke on condition that he not be identified.
Yet experts agree Iran is still far from the point where it would consider better ties with the United States, and they say it strongly objects to a lengthy stay of American forces in the gulf.
Iran's reactions to the invasion of Kuwait emcompass a number of conflicting interests.
For one thing, there is a feeling of solidarity inside Iran, a non-Arab country with a Shiite Muslim population, toward the Arab Shiites who constitute a majority of the population in Iraq and who may suffer heavy losses in life during a war.
Also, Iran is not certain of the ability of the United States to contain the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, and therefore is reluctant to undertake any further actions that may antagonize him.
"What they really want is for Saddam to be weakened but not destroyed," Mrs. Hunter said. "They want Iraq contained, not obliterated."
Therefore, Iran has strongly condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait while vigorously pursuing its peace settlement with Baghdad.
Another motivation for the evident ambivalence toward Iraq is a dominant sentiment among even the pragmatic leadership of President Rafsanjani's Government that the United States is still a force seeking to dominate the gulf region's oil resources to the detriment of Iran and Iraq.
For that reason, Iraq is still looked upon by many Iranian strategists as a potential ally against pro-Western Arab nations led by Saudi Arabia.
 
A Reversal of Roles
 Still, the cumulative changes in Iran's foreign and domestic policies constitute what many commentators believe to be a reversal of roles in the gulf region between Iraq and Iran.
"Saddam Hussein, who started out as a pragmatist, is becoming an ideologue," said Baqer Moin, an Iranian author and commentator who lives in London. "His early speeches after the invasion of Kuwait look like copies of Khomeini's lexicon."
He noted that it is Mr. Hussein who is now calling for holy war against the Americans and their allies while Mr. Rafsanjani is pursuing expanded ties to the West and the gulf Arabs.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Continued Gloom Predicted In Outlook for Ad Spending

BYLINE: By Kim Foltz

 BODY:
THE outlook for advertising spending in the United States for 1991 is gloomier than expected, said Robert J. Coen, a senior vice president and the director of forecasting at McCann-Erickson.
Speaking in New York yesterday to media executives and securities analysts at the 18th annual media outlook conference sponsored by Paine Webber Inc., Mr. Coen said total ad spending in the United States next year would increase by only 4.6 percent, to $136 billion. That would be the lowest growth rate in nearly two decades. 
 Earlier this year, Mr. Coen predicted that 1991 spending would increase by 7.5 percent, but he tempered that yesterday because of the worsening economy and uncertainty over the Middle East.
This bad news follows a lackluster 1990 for the industry. Ad spending had been expected to rise 6.2 percent this year, but Mr. Coen said expenditures increased just 4.9 percent, to $130 billion.
In his semiannual report on media outlook, Mr. Coen said spending might "pick up gradually" in the second half of next year. But he does not expect "significant improvement" until 1992, when the Olympic Games should result in a big lift. Mr. Coen expects this upward trend to continue for the remainder of the 1990's.
There is one bright spot: Spending in Europe and other foreign countries is expected to increase by 7.5 percent, to $156 billion, next year. With United States spending added to that, Mr. Coen said in his report, total worldwide ad expenditures should rise by 6.1 percent next year, to $292 billion. Worldwide spending is expected to rise at even faster rates for the remainder of this decade, he said.
The countries that saw the biggest rises in spending this year were Spain, with a 12 percent increase, and France, with 11 percent. In addition, spending in Japan, Italy and the Netherlands increased by about 9 percent.
This should be especially good news for Madison Avenue's largest agencies, most of which now earn 40 percent or more of their revenues from operations in European and other foriegn countries.
In other domestic trends, Mr. Coen said that spending by national advertisers next year is expected to be stronger than from local advertisers, increasing by 5.7 percent, to $78 billion. At the same time, local spending will rise only 3.1 percent, to $58 billion.
In broadcasting, cable and syndicated television will benefit the most from national ad spending, with Mr. Coen predicting double-digit growth continuing. This year, national advertising for cable rose 15 percent, and it rose 25 percent for syndication.
The outlook for network television is again bleak. In 1990, spending by national advertisers increased only 5 percent, and Mr. Coen said that spending would continue to be sluggish for most of next year.
Magazines, which had a dismal 1990, with ad pages dwindling at many major publications, is expected to recover somewhat next year, Mr. Coen said.
But there will not be much relief for newspapers, he said. National advertising is expected to be weaker in 1991 and local advertising will rise just 2 percent.

HEADLINE: Insurers Called Stable

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
A company that has been rating insurance companies for 90 years today told Senate investigators that the industry was not heading for the same financial troubles that befell savings and loan associations.
"We would not support the dire conclusions which have been reached regarding the potential insolvencies of several large and prominent insurers," said Michael Albanese, an analyst with the A. M. Best Company.
Mr. Albanese testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, whose chairman, Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum contends the insurance industry is showing some of the same warning signs that preceded the collapse of scores of savings and loans.
"Like past S.& L. regulation, current insurance regulation in most states is not equipped to detect or prevent another financial debacle for millions of Americans," the Ohio Democrat said.
Mr. Albanese, whose company rates 1,500 life and health insurers and 2,300 property-casualty concerns, told the subcommittee that Best does "not agree that the insurance industry as a whole at this point in time is on the brink of financial crisis analogous to that of the savings and loan industry."
Senator Metzenbaum contends that state regulators and generally accepted accounting practices allow insurers to conceal their true financial situation by valuing such bonds and real estate at purchase price, rather than at present value.

HEADLINE: Unable to Work, He Gets Help From the Neediest Cases Fund

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
William J. Jagacki peered at the framed photographs of his family on the bedroom wall yesterday morning and pointed to the snapshots of his wife, himself and his stepdaughter. He then stopped, unable to identify the baby in the last photo.
"It's Kelly?" he softly said to his wife, Margaret. She patiently corrected him, telling him the right name. 
 "My memory isn't so good any more," said Mr. Jagacki, 37 years old, who has epilepsy. "I can't remember names and dates so well."
Mr. Jagacki, an unemployed butcher, stands a trim 6 foot 4 inches and appears robust and muscular. He loves to go fishing, makes his own rods and reels and has caught several dozen bluefish in the last two weeks. Yet he will not venture to the beach -- a block away from his apartment in Far Rockaway -- unless his wife or a friend goes with him.
 
Epileptic Seizures Continue
 It has been about three years since Mr. Jagacki began fainting and having convulsions. A year ago, he lost his job in a supermarket after having a seizure behind the dairy counter, in front of customers. Over the summer, he had a seizure while wading in the ocean and almost drowned. A few weeks ago, he had a seizure on a bus. He takes 700 milligrams a day of the medication Dilantin, but his seizures continue, averaging two a week.
The illness, Mr. Jagacki said, has ended the middle-class existence he once enjoyed. For him, there is no longer a car, a savings account or nights out on the town. And if the Community Service Society of New York was not helping him, the Jagackis would be without a home.
Last spring, a few months after he lost his job, the couple fell behind in their rent and received eviction notices and orders to appear in court.
When the Jagackis called for help, the Community Service Society of New York responded quickly. In April, a social worker from the agency maneuvered through the welfare system on the couple's behalf to help them get back payments of $1,750. The charity then offered to provide the couple with a monthly check for $250 -- half of their rent -- until they began receiving more substantial disability benefit checks from the Government.
The money that has allowed the Jagackis to keep their two-room apartment comes in part from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Community Service Society is one of seven charities that receive money from the fund.
The Neediest Cases 79th annual appeal began last month and already $1,442,117.55 has been received. The New York Times pays for the campaign's overhead, and all of the money is to be used by the charities to provide direct assistance for the sick and the needy.
The Jagackis said that they would have been forced to move into a friend's house or to a shelter without the help of the Community Service Society. And they are pleased to be living in their snug apartment, decorated with Elvis Presley posters and plaques of Jesus.
Mr. Jagacki said that he is not sure about his future, that every seizure deadens his memory a little bit more and that he does not know whether he will work again.
"This summer, I asked the guy next door, a contractor, if he could use me," Mr. Jagacki said. "He told me that he always had work for a big, strong guy like me. An hour into my first day, he drove me back home. I had a seizure."

Dollar Advances in U.S. After Retreating Overseas

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced in New York after falling overseas yesterday as the Federal Reserve took no apparent steps to push interest rates lower.
Foreign exchange traders went into yesterday's session fearing that the Fed, which relaxed its monetary policy on Friday, would again nudge rates downward. 
 Mike Faust, a foreign exchange analyst with MMS International in Chicago, said the market worried that the nation's central bank would lower the discount rate or take some other aggressive action.
However, "it never materialized," Mr. Faust said. "The dollar got a temporary reprieve."
On Friday, the Fed announced it was injecting $1.5 billion into the banking system, a move designed to encourage banks to make funds more available and to allow interest rates to fall. The Fed acted after the Labor Department issued an employment report that showed the economy continued to weaken in November.
The dollar, which is supported by higher interest rates, fell sharply after the Fed's move. When no further steps were taken yesterday, the United States currency moved higher.
Mr. Faust said that despite the dollar's rise, the outlook for the dollar remained negative. If the economy continues to weaken, the Fed may be forced to relax its policy further.
The dollar gained ground against the Japanese yen in New York, closing at 132.15 yen, up from 130.70 yen late Friday. In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 130.55 Japanese yen from 132.17 yen at Friday's close, and in London, it was quoted at 130.55 yen.
The British pound was also brought lower by interest rate concerns. The market expects the new Government in Britain to lower rates.
Sterling fell to $1.9442 in New York, from $1.9535 late Friday, and in London, the pound fell to $1.9450, from $1.9510 late Friday.

Delta Withdraws Moscow Proposal

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Delta Air Lines asked to withdraw its proposal for a nonstop flight from Atlanta to Moscow and filed instead for a route with one stop in Germany. The Atlanta-based airline had previously asked the Department of Transportation for permission to operate three weekly nonstop flights between Atlanta and Moscow-Leningrad in 1991.
Delta cited increased fuel costs and economic conditions in the United States and the Soviet Union as reasons for the decision not to pursue nonstop service.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Accounting Education Broadened

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
THE career outlook for young accountants will depend upon their quality, so much that the the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has decreed that new members starting in the year 2000 must have 150 credit hours of education.
That means 30 hours of graduate training in addition to the equivalent of the usual 120 hours or so of undergraduate study. Universities across the country have been planning changes in their accounting curriculums in response to the institute's position, and some have already begun new programs. One such program is at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles. 
 The dean of its accounting school, Dr. Michael A. Diamond, went to New York last week bearing a study guide of the new accounting program that will start next month.
"I believe we are one of the first, possibly the first, to start a program this spring to meet the eventual new requirements," he said. The aim is to provide better and more broadly trained accountants as well as to encourage larger numbers of undergraduates or graduates to specialize in accounting, especially minorities."
He said the changes had come about because leading accounting firms had complained for years about the quality of young accountants, as well as declining interest in the profession.
The program at U.S.C. begins in January with a new required course for undergraduates called "Core Concepts of Accounting Information." Dr. Diamond said it consisted of teaching modules that could be altered as professional needs changed.
Because of contentions that accounting is boring, the new course will use a variety of dramatic approaches, with videotapes, group study, role playing and mock stockholder meetings.
All new candidates for a bachelor of science degree in accounting, usually about 600 at any period, will take the eight-hour, two-semester course. Other new courses will be added.
As for the five-year program envisioned by the accounting institute, Dr. Diamond agrees that "many students will exit after four years."
Some will work for corporations, management consulting firms or the Government, and others might work for major accounting firms that will give them additional training and send them to obtain master's degrees, possibly at evening sessions. Dr. Rick Elam, a vice president of the accounting institute, calls accountants "ambidextrous," in that they can find jobs in many managerial areas. Accountants generally must take continuing professional training to keep state licenses, he said.
Dr. Diamond reports that more candidates for master of business administration degrees are taking additional accounting courses beyond those required -- an indication that more business students realize the helpfulness of more accounting knowledge, along with a broader education.
Dr. Diamond could be an example. A history major at the University of California at Berkeley, he later obtained a master's degree in accounting and a doctorate at the University of California at Los Angeles. He worked for a major accounting firm and taught accounting at a college in Washington before joining U.S.C.
Last week he conceded that "right now the need for young accountants is in a down cycle and there is not a notable increase in hiring." Demand will come back strongly once the economy improves, he said.
The real problem is increasing the quality of graduates, he said. Accounting education has hardly changed in the last 50 years. "It is too narrow, too centered on rules, too focused on preparation for the C.P.A. exam, too inclined to force students to memorize rather than analyze." he said.
He said that accounting's body of knowledge has "expanded tremendously" in the last 20 years. Use of computers and globalization of business have spurred the need for more broadly educated accountants, as well as the proliferation of services offered by accounting firms, like management consulting, tax advice, compensation surveys and other services.
As if updating programs is not enough of a problem, universities have a hard time finding well-qualified professors. They have to offer high salaries in two areas that are especially short, engineering and accounting, according to the American Council on Education.
To attract young accountants with doctorates, leading universities offer $70,000 for the typical nine months' work, plus perquisites like extra pay for research done in the summer. Full-time professors of accounting can command $150,000 at some universities.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
Japanese Leaders See Support for U.S. Stand in Gulf Ebbing

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 10

 BODY:
While in public Japan continues to back American policies in the Persian Gulf, business leaders, Government officials and politicians say privately that the support is ebbing away amid concern that the United States is overlooking the possibility of a compromise with Iraq.
Businessmen in particular say there is a growing consensus that their interests will suffer in a war and that the United States is not sensitive enough to the possibility that fighting, along with Arab casualties, would alienate the Arabs from the West for generations to come. 
 "The sentiment of business leaders is that the United States shouldn't be holding a gun to the head of Saddam Hussein," said Kazuo Nukuzawa, managing director of Keidanren, the largest and most influential business trade association. "There are a lot of other ways to influence his behavior."
The apparent growing reluctance among Japanese to endorse the American hard-line goals was seen as lessening the chance that Japan would increase the $2 billion it has pledged to assist the American-led military buildup in the gulf.
 
Little of Money Disbursed
 Of the original $2 billion, only about $100 million has been disbursed, but Japanese officials said nearly $1 billion was in the pipeline in the form of equipment, cash payments to the United States and payment for transportation of equipment in chartered ships and planes.
Japan also pledged another $2 billion in economic aid for Jordan, Egypt and Turkey, but less than a third has been disbursed.
Most has been held up for discussions on the kind of projects to be aided and how the aid is to fit in with the overall economic development of these countries.
President Saddam Hussein's decision last week to release all the hostages, including nearly 300 Japanese, is considered likely to reinforce the Japanese aversion to the use of force against Baghdad, various specialists say.
Responding to Mr. Hussein's move, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said again that Japan demanded an unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, which was overrun in early August.
 
Concern Over Economic Effect
 But in Japan the activities of big trading and industrial companies are often more influential than what the Prime Minister says or does, and the indications are that their concerns about the economic effect of war are rising.
As if to illustrate this point, the president of a large Japanese energy company who is close to Mr. Kaifu and several other leaders of the governing party said in an interview that he had been on the telephone all day on Friday with contacts in Iraq to try to suggest a possible compromise.
"Unless some sort of negotiations take place, Saddam Hussein will not get out of Kuwait," the president said, asking not to be identified. "It would be best if some sort of inter-Arab solution were to be found, giving Saddam some concessions on territory or oil prices or freedom of waterways."
Japanese officials say that for now they do not feel huge pressure to change the Government's policy in Iraq, but they acknowledge that this could change. The United States has ruled out any concessions, including allowing Iraqi control over Kuwaiti oilfields or oil production or pricing.
No opinion polls have surveyed what the Japanese think about the American threat to use force against Iraq, although politicians say they are haunted by the fact that polls last month showed overwhelming opposition to Japanese troops taking part in any such use of force.
 
Desire for Compromise
 A well-placed official in the governing Liberal Democratic Party of Mr. Kaifu said party members in Parliament were growing concerned that a possible compromise was being overlooked, although they were afraid of speaking out because of pressure from the United States.
Another factor in the growing concern has been a sudden spate of articles in popular and scholarly journals in recent weeks criticizing American policy in the Persian Gulf as wrong-headed, short-sighted and insensitive.
In addition, newspapers have quoted Japanese hostages in Iraq and hostages released and returned to Japan as openly criticizing the Japanese Government for what they say is subservience to Washington.
"The American method of taking short cuts, behaving in an impatient way and pushing for direct reaction is making more and more people worry," said Shigeki Koyama, president of the Japanese Institute of Middle East Economics. "People are beginning to feel that more calm, realistic measures are necessary."
Mr. Koyama and many other critical Middle East specialists, many of them longtime champions of Arab positions, are often seen on television and contributing to journals.
"More and more respectability is being given to opinions against the United States," said Takeshi Sasaki, a professor of political science at Tokyo University. "A very strong counterreaction has started in leading journals that are always very sensitive to shifts in public opinion."
 
Questions Often Raised
 A senior Foreign Ministry official involved in the gulf said that so far the Japanese public and business people were officially supportive, but he said he was concerned about the questions raised on the Middle East whenever he gave speeches on the subject.
"I lecture on this all the time," said the senior official, Yukio Okamoto. "The business people say: 'You know, so what if Saddam Hussein gets hold of the oilfields? He has to sell his oil somewhere.' And they say, 'Don't you know that the Arabs will make a deal among themselves in the end?' "
Mr. Okamoto said many Japanese suffered from what he called a disease of relativism that makes them reluctant to criticize other nations' behavior as immoral, even in extremes. "There are no examples in our history of Japan standing up for one value against another value."
Another theme being mentioned increasingly in the press and in private discussions is that the American policies are the result of pressure from Israel. Businessmen and many other Japanese also speak about the "Jewish lobby" in the United States as a factor in American policy.
"The United States is not looking at this in a balanced way," said a leading banking executive, also asking not to be identified. "The real reason behind America's involvement is the relationship with Israel. Who benefits from this? Only Israel. It is not balanced to see the Middle East through the eyes of one small country."

Questions About First Chicago

BYLINE: By Eric N. Berg

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
WITH the shares of the First Chicago Corporation down more than 40 percent this year, some people might rate the stock of the big bank holding company a "buy." After all, if First Chicago traded at $35 a share in the last year on the strength of its leading market position in the Middle West, then at its current price below $20, the stock is surely a bargain.
That, at least, might be an argument on behalf of the company. But to hear most Wall Street analysts tell it, First Chicago is anything but a buy and should probably be sold short in anticipation of further price declines. 
 Most investors doubted that First Chicago shares would fall as far as they have. Now, with concerns deepening about the bank's real estate loan portfolio, the prevailing view among market professionals is that the stock could sink to the low teens. On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, First Chicago closed at $19.75, up 62.5 cents.
"There is more bad news to be digested," said Richard Mueller, an analyst at Duff & Phelps Inc.
To be sure, not all analysts are bearish. Stephen Berman, who follows First Chicago for County NatWest Securities, has created what he considers a worst-case scenario in which 35 percent of First Chicago's real estate loans become uncollectible.His analysis shows First Chicago shares still rising to $30 a share in the next year. In view of the fact that the stock also pays a $2 dividend (10 percent), Mr. Berman rates First Chicago a buy.
But the potential for big real estate problems has most analysts nervous. What they are concerned about is not the roughly 16 percent of First Chicago's $4.5 billion in commercial real estate loans that have already experienced some degree of difficulty. Presumably, First Chicago has already established loan-loss reserves. Rather, the issue is what lies ahead.
Through its American National Bank subsidiary, First Chicago has made hundreds of millions of dollars in realty loans in the Midwest. American National has already said that more than $60 million of these loans are troubled, and some fear fear that the Midwest, which so far has held up well economically, will be the next to fall victim to the nationwide recession.
"Vacancy rates are already ticking up in Chicago," Mr. Mueller, of Duff & Phelps, said. "And once employment growth here shows, you will see even more upticks."
Analysts also note that as one of the largest issuers of Mastercard and Visa credit cards in thecountry, with $6.4 billion in receivables, First Chicago will see more defaults on card accounts as more people become strapped to pay bills. So far, the bank has reported no big increase in losses.
First Chicago also has a $3.6 billion portfolio of loans to highly leveraged companies. Although only $108 million of these loans were reported to be troubled on Sept. 30, highly leveraged loans are generally the first to suffer in a recession.
There are also uncertainties about the company's ability to control its overhead. First Chicago's "non-interest expense" rose 12 percent in the first nine months of this year, to $1.2 billion, while revenues rose only 3 percent, to $1.8 billion.
According to Norman Jaffe, a banking analyst at Fox Pitt Kelton Inc., First Chicago officials are trying to address this problem, but he stopped short of predicting broad layoffs.
Lisabeth Weiner, a First Chicago spokeswoman, said that the company was reviewing operations, but that so far only a small number of the bank's 17,250 employees had been laid off.
Complicating matters for holders of the stock is that First Chicago recently reinstated its dividend reinvestment plan, under which shareholders can buy newly issued shares at a 4 percent discount from market. That has left some Wall Street analysts puzzled because the move, while providing fresh capital for the company, could reduce earnings per share and send the stock price lower still.
But according to Ms. Weiner, the dividend reinvestment plan should be only mildly dilutive, if at all, and is less generous than many other plans.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
Quayle, in Sharp Attack, Accuses Some Democrats of 'Playing Politics' on the Gulf

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PINEHURST, N.C., Dec. 10

 BODY:
Vice President Dan Quayle charged today that some Congressional Democrats holding hearings on the deployment of American troops to the Persian Gulf were "playing politics" and undermining the United States' position in the crisis.
"A Congress solidly united behind the President would strengthen our chances for peace," the Vice President said. "But that would require Congress to resist the temptation to use the current hearings on the gulf for partisan political advantage." 
 In a speech here before a meeting of the Republican Governors' Association, the Vice President used what one aide, David Beckwith, said was the strongest language to date in criticizing some Congressional Democrats.
 
Partisanship and Statesmanship
 In hearings over the past two weeks, several of the Democratic Party's more conservative voices have argued that the Bush Administration should allow time for economic sanctions against Iraq to work, getting President Saddam Hussein to leave Kuwait voluntarily rather than using force to dislodge him.
But Mr. Quayle said today: "Despite the efforts of some in Congress, the fact of the matter is that the American people support the President. Once again, the American people are ahead of their Congress.
"Unfortunately, by portraying themselves as the party of peace, and the Administration as the party of war, some Congressional Democrats -- but by no means all Congressional Democrats -- seem to have placed partisanship above statesmanship."
He specifically cited the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, which both led off their hearings with witnesses critical of the President's actions. Mr. Quayle acknowledged that the hearings had also heard "clear, candid and convincing" testimony from Administration architects of the policy, but he said President Hussein had made it clear that the Congressional hearings were useful in what the Vice President called his "political war against the United States."
 
Democrats' Response
 "Saddam has even gone so far as to heap praise on the Congress," Mr. Quayle said. "Saddam's purpose in all this is perfectly clear. He hopes to encourage Congress to deprive the Bush Administration of its option to use force."
Democrats involved in the hearings said Mr. Quayle's criticisms were misplaced. "The first partisan statement has just come from Vice President Quayle," said Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. "I know of no one who has suggested that the threat of force should not be real and unmistakable. Whether it's now or later, Saddam Hussein faces the same ultimate day of reckoning. But many of us are fighting to guarantee that we maintain consensus in this country so that should shooting start, the policy does not fall apart."
Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat who is also on the Foreign Relations Committee, said, "The fact that a member of Congress has genuine concerns about the Adminstration's policy does not mean he is being partisan, particularly about a policy that would put the nation at war," and added, "For what it's worth, I note that the hostages are coming out."
 
'Real Comfortable in That Role'
 The tough, partisan comments by Vice President seemed consistent with the role he has played in other recent confrontations between the Administration and Congress. In the tax debate this fall, it was Mr. Quayle who often fiercely challenged Democratic criticism of the President.
"He looks real comfortable in that role," said William Lucas, director for liaison services in the Justice Department.
Mr. Quayle asserted that the Administration was determined to resolve the gulf crisis peacefully, but that the Iraqi leader did not seem to understand that the United States and its allies were also determined to end his aggression. The Vice President said the coming mission to Baghdad by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d would show that determination. "We are committed," he said. "The coalition is committed. The world is committed."
The Republican governors gathered here in a time of confusion for many of them after midterm elections that slightly thinned their ranks or gave some of them tougher races than they expected. Before the election there were 28 Democratic governors and 22 Republicans; on Nov. 6 the voters elected 28 Democrats, 19 Republicans and 2 independents (both former Republicans). The race in Arizona will be decided by a runoff, since neither candidate won a clear majority.
All in all, said Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri, the governors' association's departing chairman, it was not a bad midterm election, given earlier predictions that the Republicans would lose four or five governorships.

HEADLINE: Giving New Purpose To the Space Program

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Ever since the lunar explorations of Apollo two decades ago, a general perception of the American civilian space program has been that of a giant spaceship in a decaying orbit: still capable of some brilliant flourishes, but directionless and drifting lower with diminishing ground support.
 Nothing, not even the Challenger tragedy in 1986, could change its course and reinvigorate it with a new sense of purpose. 
 But the White House, Congressional leaders, scientists and some of the space agency's harshest critics believe the program has now been shown the way back to steady orbit with a more promising future. In their view, the committee assessing the future of the civilian space program, in its report today, has done nothing less than lay out a realistic blueprint for the post-shuttle, post-cold-war era of space exploration.
 
 Facing the Facts
 In what could be a historic turning point, the committee confronted facts that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had long refused to face and identified the two major stumbling blocks to fundamental change -- the unreliable space shuttle and the poorly conceived Freedom space station. The committee recommended a gradual phasing out of the first and a sweeping redesign of the second.
 The shuttles would be largely replaced by a fleet of heavy-lift rockets, for robotic operations and later for human flight. The space station would be stripped to a more modest size and given a more narrowly defined objective: studies in the life sciences. It so happens that more powerful rockets and experience in the effects of long-duration flight on human physiology would be essential prerequisites for reaching goals set by President Bush last year, a return of astronauts to the Moon to establish permanent outposts and the eventual flight of humans to Mars, perhaps by 2019.
Unlike many Government reports, this one is not so likely to sink out of sight, because it strikes chords pleasing to a wide range of interests.
A senior White House official said some of the committee's recommendations could be incorporated in the 1992 budget that is being prepared for submission to Congress in late January. NASA officials will be asked to confer with the Office of Management and Budget within 30 days.
 
'Go as You Pay' Effort
 President Bush should like what he sees because the committee endorses his view that the long-term "magnet of the manned space program is the planet Mars" and favors a "go as you pay" effort to get there that might not be so frightening to fiscal conservatives. And Vice President Dan Quayle, who directs the National Space Council, has already praised the committee's findings and is expected by his associates to take a forceful hand in seeing that many of the recommendations are carried out. He may try to use the space issue as a means of gaining greater political visibility.
The report is likely to strike a responsive note in Congress, at least on the point of redesigning the space station to reduce costs, whose estimated cost had risen as high as $35 billion for the decade. The appropriations committees had already told NASA to come up with a less expensive concept or have it scrapped altogether. At the same time, the budget-conscious Congress eliminated almost every cent requested for the kinds of long-range technology development being recommended by the committee.
Senator Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, said the changes were needed to restore confidence in NASA and added that the Science, Technology and Space subcommittee, which he heads, would conduct hearings in the next session. Representative Bill Green, a Manhattan Republican who is a frequent critic of NASA operations, agreed with the proposed changes in the space station and the call for greater emphasis on scientific research by NASA, but cautioned that the advisory committee's underlying assumption of that NASA's appropriations would grow 10 percent a year over the decade, after taking inflation into account, "seems difficult to attain."
The most exuberant response so far has come from scientists, who cannot believe their possible good fortune. "This could be the dawn of a second golden age," said Dr. Bruce C. Murray, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology who has been especially critical of the space program's emphasis on the shuttles and space station at the expense of scientific exploration.
 
 'Realistic' Recommendations
 John E. Pike, a space policy analyst for the Federation of American Scientists in Washington, had high expectations that many of the changes would come about. Unlike other recent examinations of space policy, he said, "This is a realistic set of recommendations rather than a pie-in-the-sky wish list."
NASA officials, if not elated, were at least relieved that the advisory committee had not proposed a major overhaul of the agency's organization, as some had feared. The agency's leaders said they were pleased with the report's general tone and would take the recommendations seriously.
"There may be some initial resentment at NASA," said Dr. John M. Logsdon, a space policy expert at George Washington University and frequent advisor to the agency. "But there's so much common sense in the report that NASA will finally fall behind it as the best way to get White House and Congressional support."
If the recommendations are adopted, it will be the beginning of the end for the shuttle program. The military is no longer interested in using the shuttle, commercial payloads were barred after the Challenger accident and now NASA is even being told to find something less expensive and more reliable for its own operations. Shuttles will still be needed through the end of the decade, the committee concluded, but less and less so. A proposed fifth shuttle would not be built, with the money saved going to the heavy-lift boosters.
The committee also recognized another ending for the space program: the end of its cold war connection.
"Clearly times have changed," said Norman R. Augustine, head of the committee and chairman of the Martin Marietta Corporation. "The heavy driver for the space program used to be competition with the Soviets. Today, there is not that clear competition, but the fundamental values of exploration that drive us. They are less tangible, but no less important."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Securities Prices Increase

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The credit market rally continued yesterday, as prices of Treasury securities rose and interest rates fell further.
The bulk of the gains were achieved during overseas trading, but the positive momentum generated by the weak November employment data released Friday continued to swirl even after activity shifted to American financial markets. 
 Even with yesterday's gains, traders said it would probably be difficult for the market to improve significantly this week.
"The unfortunate thing for us is that the employment number was so bad," one government bond trader said.
The Fed, reacting to the employment data, lowered its target on the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market on Friday, to 7.25 percent. But it made no announcement yesterday that it has decided to lower its discount rate, currently at 7 percent.
In spite of the Fed's failure to make that move, "there is a constant thought that at any point the Fed could lower the discount rate," said Mitchell Held, chief financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
While a cut in the discount rate would have more of a psychological than practical effect on the economy, most market participants said they expect the Fed would follow a half-point reduction in the discount rate by cutting the funds rate again, to 7 percent.
"The market is still expecting a lot from the Fed," the bond trader said.
 
Drop in Short-Term Rates
 The steep drop in short-term rates that occurred last week was visible in the results of yesterday's weekly auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills.
At the auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 6.86 percent, down sharply from the average rate of 7.06 percent at last week's sale.
Meanwhile, six-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 6.74 percent, compared with an average rate of 6.96 percent a week ago.
The rates are the lowest on three-month and six-month bills since auctions held in July, 1988.
Traders said that participation at the bill sale was good, but with rates now under 7 percent, Mr. Held and others said that investors seeking higher yields are now extending out the maturity spectrum, particularly into 30-year Treasury bonds.
"We are close to where appreciation in the bond is outperforming cash this year," Mr. Held said. "When you have an asset that is rising like that, there is a tendency on the part of money managers to get it on their books."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered late yesterday at a price of 106 31/32, up 5/8 a point, to yield 8.12 percent, compared with 8.17 percent late Friday. Barring any shooting in the Middle East, dealers said yields on the benchmark issue could soon slide below 8 percent.
Among Treasury notes, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 103 21/32, up 13/32, to yield 7.95 percent. And the 7 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 6/32, up 2/ 32, to yield 7.26 percent.
Participants in the tax-exempt municipal bond market began what looks to be an active week by pricing a number of issues yesterday, including $266.79 million worth of securities for the Jacksonville Electric Authority.
Underwriters from Lehman Brothers acted as lead managers for the negotiated sale. The offering consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1996 to 2005 and a term bond that matures in 2007.
At pricing, yields on the serial bonds range from 6.05 percent in 1996 to 6.50 percent in 2000 and 6.80 percent in 2005. The term bond was priced to yield 6.85 percent.
Ratings of AA were expected from both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt securities, prices of widely quoted issues rose by about 1/8 point, dealers said.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, prices of most issues were unchanged on the day, according to participants.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Weicker Nominates 3 For Social-Service Jobs

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Governor-elect Lowell P. Weicker Jr. announced three more nominations for his emerging independent administration today, including a Democrat to head the Department of Aging, a Republican to be in charge of economic development and a private businessman to oversee public housing.
The nominations, which must be approved by the Democrat-controlled General Assembly, are Mr. Weicker's first in the areas of social policy. The nominees gave little indication yesterday of their positions on major issues facing the state, and Mr. Weicker stressed even as the group was introduced at a State Capitol news conference that there would be little money in the deficit-ridden state budget for expensive new initiatives. 
 The nominees are State Representative Edith G. Prague as Commissioner of Aging, Joseph J. McGee as Commissioner of Economic Development and Henry S. Scherer Jr. as Commissioner of Housing.
Mr. Weicker, a former Republican, will take office next month as Connecticut's first independent governor since the 1850's. He has already nominated two Democrats to the top posts in his budget office and two Republicans to be his chiefs of staff.
 
A Diverse Group
 He said that all three nominees introduced today were longtime personal friends, but that they had little else common. "What stands out in this group is that it's very diverse," he said, adding that "since we don't have money, we need creativity and we need brains."
Mrs. Prague, a 65-year-old Democrat from Columbia, was among the first members of the General Assembly to endorse Mr. Weicker for governor earlier this year.
Mr. McGee, 44, is a Republican bank executive from Fairfield who briefly ran for governor himself earlier this year. He served as staff director in the 1970's for United States Representative Stewart B. McKinney, Republican of Fairfield.
Mr. Scherer, 59, is the chief executive of an East Hartford company that makes reinforced steel. He met Mr. Weicker in the early 1950's when they both attended Yale University. Of the three nominees, only Mr. Scherer, a registered Republican, said he would join A Connecticut Party, the party Mr. Weicker organized this spring around his candidacy.
 
Problems Ahead
 If approved by the General Assembly, the three commissioners will face daunting challenges, ranging from the state's slumping economy, which has battered cities like Bridgeport and Hartford, to the rising price of heating oil, which has affected thousands of elderly residents on fixed incomes.
Public housing, clustered in the state's poor cities, is also becoming a burden on local budgets in some communities. Hartford's City Manager, Eugene Shipman, suggested recently that the city's public housing projects be razed and new public housing distributed equally in rich and poor communities.
Asked about Mr. Shipman's proposal, Mr. Scherer said he needed to familiarize himself more with the issues. Mrs. Prague said she had avoided thinking about the grim realities she will face if appointed.
"I'm so excited today, I don't want to get depressed thinking about that," she said.
Mr. McGee said the focus of his agency would be "jobs, jobs, jobs," to help combat the recession that he said had already begun in Connecticut.

HEADLINE: Civic Groups to Sue, Urging Alternative to West Side Highway Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Charging that government officials had unlawfully ignored alternatives to rebuilding the West Side Highway as it stands, a coalition of civic groups in New York City announced yesterday that they will sue to force consideration of other approaches.
The groups, including the Municipal Art Society, the Parks Council and People for Westpride, will argue that a failure by city and state officials to review alternatives to the existing viaduct, which runs from 59th to 72d Street, violates Federal laws that require environmental reviews and protect parkland.At stake is the future of the Hudson River waterfront where Donald J. Trump dreams of building his enormous Trump City complex, but which the civic groups envision as a riverfront park, with development further east.
 
A Break With Dinkins
 The lawsuit, to be filed today in Federal Court in Manhattan, would also mark a rupture in relations between Mayor David N. Dinkins and a number of the civic leaders who had earlier cheered his pronouncements on city planning and community involvement in land-use issues. 
 "The honeymoon is over," said Kent L.Barwick, president of the art society. "The great disappointment is to find ourselves in court so soon after the nuptials.
"Here was a fine place for the new administration to fulfill its responsibilities instead of responding to highway engineers or bureaucrats in Albany. The fact that they didn't is not only disappointing. When it rises to the level it has here, it is unlawful."
The society and the Parks Council have successfully challenged city projects in court before, most notably in 1987, when they opposed a large development on the site of the New York Coliseum at Columbus Circle. That suit forced the withdrawal and subsequent redesign of the proposal.In the West Side Highway project, government officials have been proceeding with an $85 million plan to rehabilitate and realign the existing elevated structure. Contractors' bids are due next month.
Private planners and environmentalists have urged for some time that the highway be lowered to ground level in the area of the former railroad yards north of 59th Street and that its course be shifted inland. That would create room for a 25-acre park along the river's edge. The road would run at grade level from 59th Street to 68th Street and then begin rising to meet the Henry Hudson Parkway at 72d Street.
In October, the Municipal Art Society, the Parks Council and the Westpride group believed they had an agreement with City Hall under which their proposal would be studied by a special committee for two months.
But Mr. Barwick said that a week after the agreement for a study was reached, Barbara J. Fife, Deputy Mayor for Planning and Development, called to say "that the city decided not to go through with the study."
Ms. Fife said yesterday: "It was not my impression that we had an agreement. It was my impression that there were several issues outstanding."
City officials argued yesterday, as they have in the past, that it would not be practical to delay the rehabilitation of the existing highway.
 
Assessing the Costs
 "The road is in a very, very bad state of disrepair," Ms. Fife said. "It would be misleading to indicate that we had a whole lot of time to let that condition continue. It would have been misleading to indicate that we had the capital money to build a replacement road. The road that is now out for bids is not being replaced with any city money."
The alternatives, Ms. Fife said, were "either to keep repairing the road, at the expense of almost everything else in the city, or set 90,000 cars a day on the streets of the West Side."
An engineering study conducted for the civic groups concluded that building costs for the alternative plan might range from $50 million to $75 million.
"The critical and somewhat startling finding," said Linda Davidoff, executive director of the Parks Council, "was that it was not only reasonable but cheaper than what the state had proposed to spend on repairing the highway."
Daniel Gutman, an environmental consultant to the Westpride group, said that only 30 percent of the cost of the current project would go toward structural repair, with the rest being spent on the realignment and expansion of the highway.
Philip K. Howard, vice president of the Municipal Art Society, said, "All we're asking them to do is some planning, to look at alternatives -- things they should do anyway."
An alternative highway would completely disrupt the Trump Organization's plans for the railyard site: a 150-story skyscraper and more than a dozen other high-rise buildings, a shopping center and parkland.

HEADLINE: Miami Journal;
Months of Regrets by All But Not a Single Apology

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Saying you're sorry is difficult for friends, sib lings and lovers. It can be especially hard for politicians, whose constituents will analyze every word and every sentiment, expressed or held silent. It can be virtually impossible for a politician who feels he has nothing to apologize for in the first place.
The politics of apologies are on display in this sunny city as stiff-necked and prideful representatives of two of Miami's major ethnic groups, blacks and Cubans, argue over the way Nelson Mandela was treated when he visited here five months ago. 
 A group of blacks, stung by what they considered the snubbing of Mr. Mandela by local politicians, is demanding that the political leaders apologize. Until they do, the black group has asked national black organizations not to hold meetings or conventions in the Miami area.
Calls for the boycott began after the Miami City Commission rescinded a proclamation welcoming Mr. Mandela, the deputy president of the African National Congress. The commissioners were angered by comments the South African nationalist had made praising President Fidel Castro of Cuba; Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the leader of Libya, and Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, for their support of the battle against racial separation in South Africa.
 "There is nothing wrong with saying they disagree with him," H. T. Smith, the spokesman for the local group, Boycott Miami: Coalition for Progress, said of the commissioners. But he added, "Notwithstanding their personal feelings about Mr. Mandela's views, they have the responsibility as a result of their jobs to provide a minimal level of respect."
Local politicians, Mr. Smith said, have to realize how much hurt was caused among blacks. After an apology is given, Mr. Smith said, he wants to talk with business leaders about increasing opportunities for blacks in the tourism industry. Although blacks make up 20.5 percent of Dade County's population, they hold only 5.1 percent of the tourism jobs.
Ten black organizations have canceled gatherings that were to be held in Miami. The Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau estimates the cancellations will cost the economy about $5.4 million over the next several years, a small portion of the $245 million generated each year by conventions.
The National Organization for Women and the American Civil Liberties Union recently announced their support for the boycott.
On Nov. 29, one of the local politicians, Mayor Stephen Clark of Dade County, apologized but said he had nothing to do with any snubs.
"I'm the one who got snubbed," Mr. Clark said. "Here I am, the Mayor of two million people, and I wasn't invited to go to the airport. I wasn't invited to go to the podium. I wasn't asked to issue any proclamations."
Two other Mayors, Alex Daoud of Miami Beach and Xavier Suarez, Miami's Cuban-born Mayor, have steadfastly refused to say they are sorry, even though both admit Mr. Mandela's visit was not handled well.
The dispute further tears at the social fabric of a city where ethnic and racial resentments are continually bubbling to the surface.
"I was at a meeting and there was heated discussions with some Latin friends of mine over the Mandela incident," said Georgia Ayers, a social worker who is black. "One Latin man said he was insulted that Mandela would come into his living room and express such views. That really ticked me off. I consider his living room to be in Cuba."
"There are some people who are glad that black conventions are not coming to Miami," said Leslie Pantin, a Cuban who owns a public relations firm. Blacks must realize, he said, how much hurt was caused among Cubans by Mr. Mandela's remarks about President Castro.
Mr. Suarez came close to apologizing at a Nov. 29 news conference, in which he expressed regret about the handling of the visit. But Mr. Suarez stressed the word "regret" and said he was not apologizing.
Mr. Smith said that wasn't good enough.

HEADLINE: Nationwide Banks Urged

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
A group of economists urged the Treasury today to allow banks to open branches nationwide, saying such a move would help restore health to the troubled industry.
"Nationwide branching would allow banks to capture the full benefits of diversification," said the group, known as the Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee. "It also would permit mergers that would help the banking system return to financial health."
Banks have only limited rights now to open branches beyond their home states. Typically, they must stay within their own region.
The economists say such constraints are responsible for the high rate of United States bank failures. They said such limits caused many failures in Texas when oil and real estate prices fell, and in the Midwest when farm incomes declined.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Sees $250 Million Budget Gap

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Having cut services to close a budget gap of nearly $400 million in the current fiscal year, Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that because of expected cuts in state aid and projected tax shortfalls, New York City faced a new gap of $250 million and would have to trim still more.
Mr. Dinkins had warned that the state cuts might cost the city as much as $185 million, but he had not suggested how far the total budget could be pushed out of balance. Budget Director Philip R. Michael said possible further reductions in sales-tax receipts could push the gap to $300 million. 
 Mr. Michael said that at least half of the new gap would have to be closed through cuts in spending for workers or materials, with the rest to come from expected modest miscellaneous revenue increases or bond refinancings. But city officials said that making a $250 million adjustment over the remaining seven months of the fiscal year would be difficult.
 
'Further Action' and 'More Pain'
 At the same time, the city is struggling to make cuts to help close a gap of at least $1.3 billion for the 1992 fiscal year, which starts on July 1. That gap is the deficit the city says will remain out of a previous estimate of at least $1.6 billion, after accounting for the annual effect of the cuts already made.
In disclosing the new gap, Mr. Dinkins echoed the comments of fiscal monitors who suggested in recent weeks that the current budget was, at best, precariously balanced, despite the earlier cuts. The Mayor said the city would take "further action, albeit that that action is harsh," and plugging the new hole would bring "more pain."
Mr. Dinkins said he had not decided where the additional cuts would be made. But he said that a $40 million program of contingencies outlined last month -- including the closing of six fire companies, layoffs of teachers, cuts in garbage collection, reduced money for centers for the elderly and cuts in parks maintenance -- would be among the first options considered.
The Mayor made his comments as reporters at City Hall questioned him about a meeting he and top aides had yesterday morning with the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the Wall Street rating agency. Two months ago, the agency placed the city's bonds on a negative credit watch, a warning that it might lower the rating and thus force the city to pay more in interest.
With the city preparing to issue $1.3 billion in long-term bonds tomorrow, Standard & Poor's is to issue a statement on the city's credit today. Mr. Dinkins, who canceled two planned appearances to meet with the agency, acknowledged that "the question is whether or not they just leave us as we are" or lower the rating.
Given either possibility, it did Mr. Dinkins no harm to put out his latest bad news swiftly, though he did so in a matter-of-fact tone that seemed to bespeak how routine such periodic pronouncements have become at City Hall.
The announcement also kept up pressure on the city's municipal unions, which are negotiating new contracts, and on the State Legislature, whose approval is needed for the use of pension funds to finance part of Mr. Dinkins's 5.5 percent pay raise for teachers. The raise has drawn harsh criticism from fiscal monitors.
 
'An Enormous Hit'
 First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said the new gap was "an enormous hit," that "is going to be very difficult and very painful to be sure."
While Mr. Dinkins did not commit himself to cutting all of the specific programs that had already been identified as contingencies, Mr. Steisel said, "Generally speaking, the list would be implemented."
"There may be some fine tuning," he said. He said the city expected to outline the cuts next week, and to provide greater detail in January, when it will also announce its plans for closing next year's gap.
For next year, Mr. Michael has ordered most agencies to outline how they would cut up to 17.5 percent of their budgets, if need be. City officials have warned that thousands of layoffs or other severe service cuts might be needed, and agencies are now negotiating specific proposals.
 
$100 Million in State Cuts
 Of the new $250 million gap, Mr. Steisel said the city expected about $100 million to be caused by cuts in the state budget planned by the Cuomo administration, including money for education, Medicaid and unrestricted aid, with the remaining $150 million caused by more revenue shortfalls.
Mr. Michael said that $50 million of the shortfall was in sales-tax receipts, which had generally kept up with expectations because of inflation, but which have softened since the Persian Gulf crisis began. He said sales taxes might also slip $50 million more.
The remaining $100 million was in shortfalls in taxes related to real-estate transactions, Mr. Michael said.
Among the extra revenues that might help offset such declines, Mr. Michael said, is $25 million earmarked to begin Mr. Dinkins's broad anti-crime plan. If the State Legislature approves the special taxes that the city is seeking to finance the plan, the $25 million would no longer be needed, and could go toward balancing the budget.
Mr. Michael said he planned to maintain the city's general reserve fund at $150 million, as a cushion against possible further problems.

SHAMIR BARS DEAL WITH THE 'ENEMY'

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel said in a speech in New York City last night that his country would not acquiesce in any "move to appease Saddam Hussein at the expense of Israel."
In advance of his meeting with President Bush in Washington today, Mr. Shamir made it clear that Israel would reject any move in the United Nations or elsewhere to put pressure on it to give up some of its occupied Arab lands. Some governments have argued that this, by raising the Palestinian issue, might allow Iraq a chance to pull out of Kuwait in a face-saving manner. 
 Alluding to the discussions going on at the United Nations Security Council in which some governments are seeking language for a resolution calling for an international conference on Arab-Israeli issues, Mr. Shamir said: "The well-known argument will be that Israel should make a contribution, ostensibly for the sake of world peace."
 
No Munich for Israel
 "Let me, therefore, state at the very outset: Israel in 1990 is not Czechoslovakia of 1938," he went on. "We shall not acquiesce to any deal with enemies who wish to destroy us."
He was referring to the Munich agreement of 1938 in which Britain and France acceded to Hitler's demand that Czechoslovakia turn over the Sudetenland to Germany. The Government in Prague acquiesced and several months later Czechoslavakia was totally occupied by Germany. World War II broke out in September 1939 when Germany invaded Poland.
In a reference to the Bush Administration's stated position on the issue, Mr. Shamir added, "We trust the American Government's determined stand not to permit Saddam Hussein to link the gulf crisis with the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian issue."
Mr. Shamir spoke at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan, where he received the $100,000 Defender of Jerusalem Award -- formerly known as the Jabotinsky Award -- given annually by the Jabotinsky Foundation, which is named after Vladimir Jabotinsky (1880-1940), a Russian-born right-wing Zionist leader and author.
The award went to Mr. Shamir "in recognitiion of his lifetime commitment to the defense of Jewish rights and to the safety and security of Israel."
 
A Signal From Shamir
 Officials familiar with Mr. Shamir's thinking said that he was signaling that Israel would not accept even a hint that, after an eventual settlement of the Persian Gulf crisis, there might be some sort of after-the-fact linkage with the Arab-Israeli confrontation.
They suggested that the signal indicated that Israel would not acquiesce in any regional settlement involving it and the Arabs if such a settlement were to be in any way a quid pro quo for a settlement of the Persian Gulf crisis.
In a reference to the United Nations, Mr. Shamir contended that "free and democratic states continue to cater to the pressures and threats of a group of dictatorial governments" led by the Palestine Liberation Organization.
"Enemies of freedom, democracy and basic human rights cannot be prophets of progress," he went on. "Nor can the U.N. open a new chapter as long as dictatorships like Libya and Iraq can sit in the Security Council, while Israel is the one U.N. member excluded" from it.
 
180,000 Soviet Jews in '90
 Mr. Shamir also noted the influx of Soviet Jews into Israel and the economic burden it puts on the country. He is expected to ask Mr. Bush for more economic aid to Israel to ease the absorption of the new immigrants.
Mr. Shamir said that by the end of 1990, the total number of Soviet immigrants "could arrive at a figure of 180,000 for the year," which he said "equals the number of all the Russian Jews who came to Israel in the 20 years from 1968 to 1988."
Indeed, he said: "There is now a realistic expectation that we may increase our population by one million in the next three to five years. This is equivalent to the United States' absorbing 60 million immigrants in three to five years."
While praising the influx as "nothing short of a miracle," he said, "it is a mammoth undertaking to receive them and absorb them, to house, educate and provide jobs for hundreds of thousands of people."
 
$40 Billion in 4 Years
 "The estimated cost for all this in the next three or four years is around $40 billion," he said. "To provide such a vast sum will require the joint effort, the aggregate strength and the collective thinking and ingenuity of the entire Jewish people," both those in Israel and elsewhere.
He went on to express what he called "our people's profound gratitude to successive U.S. Administrations for their invaluable assistnce in our efforts and struggle for the repatriation in Israel of our brethren from the Soviet Union."
Mr. Shamir did not allude specifically to the possibility of additional United States Government aid, but he observed that, "Everyone, Jew or gentile, who stands up for the right of the Jewish people, for the justice of our cause, who has fought for the repatriation of our brethren from the Soviet Union, who has recognized the uniqueness of Jerusalem as the united capital of our state, contributes to the modern miracle of Israel."

HEADLINE: MOSCOW ASKS U.S. FOR FOOD SUPPLIES; BAKER HINTS AT AID

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
For the first time, the Soviet Union publicly asked the United States today for food supplies to help it overcome shortages in major cities. In response, the Bush Administration indicated it would provide some kind of aid.
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze made the appeal in response to a reporter's question at the start of two days of talks with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. Mr. Baker, at the same exchange with the press, said the Bush Administration intended to be "very forthcoming." 
 Mr. Shevardnadze was in Houston, Mr. Baker's hometown, to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis and how to overcome the remaining obstacles to a treaty limiting strategic nuclear weapons. President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev hope to sign the treaty at their next summit meeting, which is expected to take place early next year.
 
Touchy Issue for the U.S.
 Food aid for the Soviet Union has become a touchy issue for the Administration, which has resisted joining Germany and other nations in giving outright grants to the Soviet Union. The Administration has said that aid is really not needed because there are no production shortages, only a breakdown in the distribution system.
But Mr. Baker, in his comments today, suggested that the Administration might be rethinking its policy on grants given the highly publicized shortages of food in major Soviet cities. He declined to specify how or when aid might be offered, but the President can provide help any time by executive order, as he did after the earthquake in Soviet Armenia in December 1988.
In addition to outright grants, the Administration could also make it easier for the Soviets to buy grain and other food by extending credits, currently barred by law.
 
Bush Considering a Waiver
 But Mr. Baker still would not say when the Bush Administration would waive the long-standing barriers to extending credits to Moscow erected because of its once-restrictive emigration policies. A waiver would open the way for the Soviets to obtain easy credits to buy American food to ease the shortages. President Bush said last week that a waiver was under serious consideration.
The National Conference on Soviet Jewry, an umbrella group of American organizations, has said it would support a waiver. And Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel said on Sunday that he favored lifting the barrier for a year or more.
"I think it's time to do it in order to help them," he said on the CBS News program "Face the Nation."
Although Germany, other Western nations and private relief groups like CARE have begun sending food and other aid to the Soviet Union, the Bush Administration has taken the view up to now that the shortages are largely a distribution problem that would not be remedied by simply dumping more food into the system.
 
Soviets 'Would Appreciate' Aid
 Pressed on why the United States did not set up its own distribution system to see that any aid is properly channeled, as the Germans have done, Administration officials said that the Soviets had not asked for help.
But today Mr. Shevardnadze asked.
As Mr. Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze were preparing to begin their discussions at the Houstonian Hotel, the Soviet minister was asked whether the time was not ripe for the United States to offer some aid, in the form of medical supplies or loan guarantees, so Moscow could buy food on easy terms.
"We would appreciate it," Mr. Shevardnadze answered.
Asked what kind of aid the Soviets would like most, Mr. Shevardnadze said: "Probably some food supplies -- that is the most acute problem -- and, of course, efficient economic cooperation."
Mr. Baker was then asked for his response. He drew a clear distinction between emergency food and medical aid, which the Administration could provide on humanitarian grounds, and trade credits allowing the Soviets to buy American food themselves.
The position of the Bush Administration has long been that the Soviet Parliament must first approve a law enshrining free emigration before it will waive the Jackson-Vanik amendment and other legal restrictions against preferential trade credits for the Soviet Union. The amendment is named after the late Senator Henry M. Jackson, Democrat of Washington, and Representative Charles A. Vanik, Democrat of Ohio.
 
Bush Said to Be Willing
 "The President is considering this question," Mr. Baker said. "He has also expressed an interest and, indeed, a willingness to be of assistance to the Soviet Union as they make this transition from one system to another -- a transition that's not simple. It's something that hasn't been done before.
"So the United States," Mr. Baker continued, "would want to be of assistance in ways that we can be. Now there are legal restrictions having to do with 40 or 45 years of history of the cold war. But as far as humanitarian assistance, medical assistance, food assistance, and that sort of thing, I know the President will be very forthcoming with respect to that kind of help."
That Mr. Shevardnadze would make a somewhat embarrassing public appeal for American food aid is a measure of both the desperate condition of the Soviet economy and the degree of cooperation that now characterizes United States-Soviet relations. The Soviet Ambassador to France, Yuri V. Dubinin, made a similar appeal in Paris last week.
The Soviets may be hoping that if they can line up enough foreign commitments of food aid, Soviet citizens will take note of it and stop hoarding, which has caused many of the distribution-related shortages. By all accounts there is no famine in the Soviet Union today. Rather, the economy, caught in the transition between central planning and a free market, is experiencing widespread chaos and shortages, prompted by breakdowns in food deliveries, hoarding, black marketeering and corruption.
 
U.S. Course Unclear
 But the seeming change in American thinking on this issue is no less striking. It is a measure of how much the Bush Administration wants to see Mr. Gorbachev's Government remain in power and keep the Soviet Union intact at a time when its cooperation has been essential in forging an international coalition to confront Iraq. Turmoil in the Soviet Union could spill over into Eastern Europe and also erase the possibility of the United States and the Soviets signing their first treaty reducing strategic nuclear arms.
How the Administration intends to proceed was not immediately clear. For several weeks it has been talking to the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association about the possibility of arranging an emergency shipment of medical supplies to the Soviet Union, which is suffering a shortage because of faulty production.
 
Emigration Bill Bogged Down
 President Bush said on Nov. 30 that he was considering waiving the Jackson-Vanik amendment for one year, even though the emigration bill is still bogged down in the Soviet Parliament. That would make the cash-strapped Soviets eligible for Commodity Credit Corporation loans to buy American food on easy terms.
Mr. Shevardnadze is to meet with Mr. Bush at the White House on Wednesday, and some clearer indication of how the Administration plans to proceed could come then.
During a break from their talks today, Mr. Baker took Mr. Shevardnadze on a tour of the Johnson Space Center here. Mr. Shevardnadze said during the visit that he expected Washington and Moscow to make "good progress" in their long effort to settle the Afghan conflict.
Reports from Pakistan suggest that the United States and the Soviet Union may issue a joint declaration this week extricating themselves from the 12-year civil war in Afghanistan, and leave the country to find a solution on its own.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Freeing the Hostages

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
No, it was not Saddam Hussein who freed the hostages held in Iraq. It was George Bush. His instrument was not the United Nations or economic pressure. It was the threat that if they were not released, American armed power would be used to destroy their jailer.
Let's understand that now, before history is rewritten by Saddam Hussein's allies and apologists. Already stories are being broadcast about how King Hussein of Jordan and Yasir Arafat talked him into it. 
 Seems they looked deep into his eyes and told him that for the sake of peace he must release the hostages. Saddam Hussein clapped his forehead and said, "Boys, I never thought of that; I will do it."
The gilding of Saddam Hussein will begin any day now -- "He's not such a bad fellow, you have to understand him." It already has started with Saddam Hussein's terrorist twin, Hafez al-Assad of Syria.
We are told by liberals and conservatives that we should actually thank Mr. Assad for making Lebanon his colony. All those Lebanese he slaughtered, all those years? Well, what were they doing standing there in the way of Syrian shells, silly people.
Mr. Bush himself, while opposing Saddam Hussein, gives Mr. Assad respectability. Consistency -- who needs it? So before the process of turning Saddam Hussein into a teddy bear begins, let's learn the lesson of the hostage release.
President Bush said American goals in the Persian Gulf were to reject aggression, liberate Kuwait, restore the royal family -- and free the hostages.
Somehow the objectives of stopping one more Arab-against-Arab foray or restoring the oil princelings of Kuwait to full use of their bank accounts did not fire the American imagination or psyche.
The only one of those goals that moved Americans was liberating the hostages. About that Mr. Bush neither blustered nor wimped. He assembled a powerful American force of troops, tanks, planes and ships. He made sure publicly and through every back channel that Saddam Hussein knew he would pay if the hostages were not freed, not just with his face but his whole head.
For Saddam Hussein the hostages became a vivid danger instead of an asset. Their release would bring him two connected benefits. One was to remove the certainty of the use of American power to release them. The second was to stoke U.S. Congressional and public opposition to use of force to "punish" aggression by restoring the Kuwaiti royal family.
Still -- if Mr. Bush had done what other Presidents did about the hostage-taking, just wail, the hostages would still be in Iraq. So when the toasts are raised about the hostages, save one for the President.
But he made an initial mistake from which he has not recovered, and which can be Saddam Hussein's salvation. Mr. Bush did not give Americans the one overriding reason for using force, other than the hostages. The one other goal Americans might have accepted if put to them and Congress was the destruction of the chemical power, nuclear potential and missile capability of a dictator for whom terrorism, aggression and expansionism are the very breath and bread of life.
So after kidnapping thousands of foreigners, costing the world hundreds of billions of dollars, virtually wiping out Kuwait as a national entity, Saddam Hussein will have paid no price, zero. Eventually he will offer to retire from Kuwait, on the understanding, which probably will be accepted by Washington and the Arab world, that he then "negotiate" with his Arab brothers about getting an oilfield and two gulf islands from Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the other oil states will then pour billions into Iraq, just as they did before the invasion of Kuwait. Syria will allow the West to replace the bankrupt Soviet Union as its arms supplier.
The U.S. will make a big noise about keeping a coalition "presence" in the area. But never again will the Arab nations muster to oppose Saddam Hussein. He will not need to send his tanks to control the oil supply of the gulf and thus the world. He can do it by telephone.
If the Bush Administration is unwilling to ask the American public and Congress to act now to prevent Saddam Hussein's control of the gulf and consequent domination of the Arab Middle East, there is no point keeping American troops in the desert to watch him enjoy his cost-free triumph. And while we give Mr. Bush deserved praise for rescuing the hostages, Saddam Hussein can put up his boots, and also raise a toast -- to himself.

HEADLINE: OBSERVER;
Look Who's Coming!

BYLINE: By Russell Baker

 BODY:
Following is a copy of the memo prepared for President Bush on the eve of one of his infrequent appearances in Washington:
 I. Airport arrival: The customary red carpet from Air Force One to the President's local transportation vehicle will be dispensed with at the instance of Richard Darman, budget director, citing the following justifications: 
 1. Since the President will be arriving on native soil it would seem unpatriotic, hence politically unwise, to allow carpeting of any color whatever to be placed between his feet and the American earth or its modern equivalents such as asphalt, concrete, oil slicks, cigarette butts, discarded beer cans and so forth.
 2. The President will be arriving in a country that has great trouble paying its bills. By avoiding the expense of red carpeting, the President can, without preaching, illustrate his belief that the destitute should never lavish their last penny on frills, especially if the penny be borrowed.
 3. Because carpeting is historically associated with Islamic culture, using it for the President's arrival in a capital with unique problems in the Middle East would be diplomatically unsound, since (a) Arab states might take offense at having this cultural symbol trod underfoot in a place like Washington, and (b) Israel might interpret purchase of the necessary carpeting as a sly scheme for subsidizing its Arab enemies.
 Two other customary airport ceremonies will be abandoned for this visit at the direction of John Sununu, White House adviser in charge of being photographed looking over the President's shoulder all over the world:
 1. The playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner" followed by the host nation's anthem will be dropped since the host country's anthem in this case is also "The Star-Spangled Banner." Consecutive renditions of this anthem ("even longer than it sounds," Mark Twain said of it) would not be "sound-bite friendly," and might renew the television industry's agitation for a new national anthem that can be played from start to finish in 10 seconds.
 2. The customary greeting of the President by the host country's head of state will be dispensed with, since this would require the President to talk to himself in public, which might be politically unsound. The idea that the President be greeted by John Sununu was dismissed after Mr. Sununu noted that it would be impossible for him to be photographed looking over the President's shoulder if he had to come around front to do the greeting.
 II. Arrival in Washington: Helicopter transport will carry the President from airport to White House. During this trip he will cross the infamous Beltway. Despite the altitude, he could recognize that he had passed inside the Beltway if he were to glance down and see the hordes of unreal people swarming below.
 This bleak mass of unreality always depresses the President. ("How nice it is to be out where the real people are -- outside of Washington, D.C.," he said recently on a visit to Nebraska.) To help the President avoid the sight, thick curtains will be drawn across the helicopter windows before intra-Beltway incursion takes place.
 During this blackout period he will be briefed on the time zone he has entered (Eastern standard), the name of the country (the United States of America), its numerical status (still Number One), the identity of its leader (George Bush of Yale, C.I.A., Skull and Bones, and U.S. Naval Aviation), the names of everyone important whom he should recognize (James Baker) and photographs of same to help him do so.
 III. Situational briefing: Immediately upon entering the White House, the President will go to the Situational Briefing Room to be briefed on the status of all pertinent situations as they have developed since his last visit to Washington. Situations to be briefed upon are as follows:
 Collapse of the domestic coalition behind his Persian Gulf policy; onset of a nationwide economic recession; the unchecked reign of murder and drug abuse; the rise in illegitimate births, homelessness and AIDS; deepening of the racial divide between whites and blacks; continuing rise of the budget deficit despite new taxes; a fresh budget nightmare created by adding the new multibillion-dollar military bill for Persian Gulf policy to staggering savings and loan bailout costs; the Japanese purchase of Hollywood . . .
 IV. Medical: At bedtime the President will suggest that another trip outside Washington may be just what the doctor would like to order, eh, Doc?

HEADLINE: Deposit Insurance Victimizes the Taxpayer;
Use Treasury Securities

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As you argue in "A Better Way to Protect Deposits" (editorial, Nov. 26), we must stop allowing savings and loan institutions and banks to take risks with Government-insured deposits. The equity stakes of stockholders are too trivial (often zero) to deter excessive risk taking at the expense of taxpayers. A big enough increase in required capital ratios is not conceivable. 
 I propose a requirement that insured deposits be backed by safe assets, mainly Treasury securities, segregated and dedicated to the redemption of those deposits. Let banks -- and savings and loans, if they survive separately -- also offer uninsured higher-yield deposits under usual regulation and supervision. Make clear that taxpayers will not bail out insolvent institutions, no matter how big, or their uninsured depositors.
No ceiling on deposit insurance per account or per depositor would be necessary. The $100,000 ceiling has been made virtually meaningless by the ingenuity of sophisticated depositors and their brokers, and by decisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation to rescue all depositors of institutions deemed too big to let fail or depositors in insolvent institutions acquired with hefty Federal subsidies.
Given this history of discretionary liberality with taxpayers funds, the F.D.I.C.'s strict treatment of the unsophisticated charities and other large depositors at Harlem's Freedom Bank is outrageous.
The Treasury is reported to be preparing proposals for further deregulation of banks. But until deposit insurance is reformed, it would be foolhardy to expand the scope of bank activities.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Industry Outlook Viewed as Gloomy

BYLINE: By JEREMY GERARD

 BODY:
A subdued, almost confessional atmosphere pervaded yesterday's start of Paine Webber's annual conference on the outlook for the media, a weeklong meeting in New York.
Top executives in the communications industries invariably began this year's prognostications by apologizing for last year's, citing recession, the crisis in the Persian Gulf, strikes at newspaper printing plants and other factors for declines in growth. 
 "Last year, I was further off the mark in my projections than I had been in all of the seven previous years combined," David F. Poltrack, CBS senior vice president for planning and research, told about 100 media analysts and industry executives. He had projected an increase in revenues for the three major broadcast networks of 8 to 9 percent; the true figure, he said, would more likely be around 2 percent. He predicted the same 2 percent for next year.
 
Underestimation by CBS
 While ABC and NBC overestimated their ratings for this television season, forcing them to offer advertisers extra time, Mr. Poltrack added, CBS underestimated, and thus would end the year in a stronger position, free of make-good obligations. ABC is owned by Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and the National Broadcasting Company is a General Electric Company unit.
Still, Mr. Poltrack said, short-term advertising purchases would be down throughout the industry in the fourth quarter. Most startling, he added, was that the share of the prime-time audience belonging to the three major networks was eroding faster than industry projections, to 64.4 percent from 68.1 percent this season. By 1995, he said, the three-network share in prime time will probably drop to the middle-50's, with Fox, independent stations, cable and public television taking the rest.
 
Profitability Drop Seen
 William G. Moll, the vice president and general manager of the NBC flagship station, Channel 4 in New York, said that while local stations would continue to be profitable, the rate of profitablility would probably drop from around 15 percent five years ago to around 3 or 4 percent. "Belt-tightening and staff downsizing will continue," Mr. Moll added. "We're doing it with fewer and fewer."
The outlook for cable television, on the other hand, could not be brighter -- especially for basic channels -- said Marshal Cohen, the executive vice president of MTV Networks, a unit of Viacom Inc. "Advertiser-supported basic cable has never been better," he said, because the channels have two revenue sources -- subscribers and advertisers -- and a low-cost product. There was also a consensus among the cable executives that Congress would again fail to pass cable regulation legislation.
But that forecast was the only gleam of light offered by the assembled executives.
 
'Culling of the Flock'
 "It is cold outside today in our business," said Donald M. Elliman Jr., the executive vice president for marketing and group publisher for Time Warner Inc. There has been a flood of magazines in the marketplace, and the resulting "selective agony" would mean a "culling of the flock," he said. But the survivors, he added, mostly personality, life style, fashion and entertainment magazines, would emerge stronger and healthier, saying that " '91 will not be a year for the faint-hearted."
William T. Kerr, the president of The New York Times Company's magazine group, said that "trendy high-fliers," like 7 Days, Smart and Spy, had not ended the year as they began it: 7 Days failed; Smart, struggling to survive, is scheduled to reappear later this month as Smart for Men, while Spy went through a restructuring.
Magazines directed toward highly targeted, specialized, upscale readers, he said, would do well.
"Let us pray," said Jack Butcher, the circulation director of The Tampa (Fla.) Tribune as he began his presentation, drawing the only laugh of the day. He added that the biggest growth areas for newspapers would be in small suburban dailies, although the major dailies in Atlanta and Los Angeles were also doing extremely well.
He said that newspapers were read most frequently by people middle-aged and older, and that the increase of that group in the next decade could be a boon to newspapers.
Profit margins for the papers will continue to shrink, said Gordon Medenica, vice president for corporate planning at the Times Company, because of "a large base of fixed costs," as well as the economic factors that have affected all of the industries.
"Ninety-one will be a difficult year for the industry," he said later, as if summing up for everyone, "But we will remain profitable."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 15, 1990, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Media Business pages on Tuesday about a media outlook conference misstated a prediction by William G. Moll, vice president and general manager of WNBC- TV. He said that in 1991 television station revenues, not profitability, would rise 3 to 5 percent over last year, and that profitability would increase slightly more.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
New Chief Is Named By Peabody Holding

BYLINE: By Daniel F. Cuff

 BODY:
The Peabody Holding Company, the nation's largest coal producer, yesterday named Irl F. Engelhardt president and chief executive.
Mr. Engelhardt, who is 44 years old, succeeds Robert H. Quenon, 62, who has been named chairman and is scheduled to retire in August. Mr. Quenon is a longtime coal executive who has been with Peabody since 1977. 
 Peabody, based in St. Louis, was acquired this year by Hanson Industries P.L.C., the British conglomerate. "Hanson is an interesting and fun company," Mr. Engelhardt said yesterday. "They have put their touch on Peabody, focusing keenly on strong earnings and have looked at the way our organization is shaped and made sure we de-layered it." As a result of the streamlining, Peabody has trimmed the number of employees.
Peabody can now "make fast decisions and move rapidly," Mr. Engelhardt said.
"By and large," he said about Hanson, "as long as we can meet our earnings projection and stay within the financial controls, they tend to let us run our business reasonably free of day-to-day involvement."
Right now, he said, the company "is looking carefully at the impact of a recession, as to whether it will have an impact on our utility customers." He said he thought the country might escape a serious recession "if we don't talk ourselves into one."
Mr. Engelhardt received a degree in accounting from the University of Illinois at Urbana in 1968 and an M.B.A. from Southern Illinois University in 1971. From 1968 to 1972 he managed the audit and tax divisions of a regional accounting firm in Champaign, Ill. From 1972 to 1979 he worked in the consulting division of Arthur Andersen.
"Peabody was one of my clients," he said, "and I got to know the company."
He joined the coal producer in 1979. Most recently he has been president of Peabody Development, a unit that manages coal marketing, purchases and other functions for Peabody.
The company he will now head mined 9 percent of the coal produced in the United States last year. It operates both surface and underground mines and has a presence in all major American coal fields.
Hanson, the parent, owns several diverse American businesses, including Jacuzzi, Endicott Johnson, Kaiser Cement and Gold Fields Mining.

HEADLINE: Armand Hammer Dies at 92; Executive Forged Soviet Ties

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Armand Hammer, the chairman of the Occidental Petroleum Company who long sought peace between the United States and the Soviet Union and financed research for a cancer cure, died at his home last night in Los Angeles. He was 92 years old.
The cause of death was not immediately reported. Frank Ashley, a spokesman for Occidental Petroleum, said Mr. Hammer "died after a brief illness." 
 Dr. Hammer, who built and led Occidental Petroleum for 33 years, at one time or another headed successful businesses in fields ranging from art to bourbon whiskey.
Dr. Hammer, who was trained as a physician but never set up a medical practice, was also a noted philanthropist and art collector who hobnobbed with the high and mighty, including members of the British royal family and generations of Soviet leaders.
Dr. Hammer bequeathed his art collection to a new museum he opened in Los Angeles on Nov. 28 in a zebra-striped building that adjoins the headquarters of Occidental Petroleum, where he was chairman and chief executive officer.
Last summer, the heirs of Dr. Hammer's late wife, Frances, who died last year at 87, filed a lawsuit contending that Dr. Hammer had tricked her into signing away her part of their collection, valued at $400 million. Dr. Hammer called the charges scurrilous.
Dr. Hammer had planned to celebrate his own bar mitzvah tonight, like much of what he did, in public. Dr. Hammer, who was raised in a non-observant family, planned to link the ceremony to a fund-raising dinner at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. The dinner was to benefit two organizations, the Pacific Jewish Center and the Jerusalem College of Technology.
Over the years, he was variously president and chairman of the Mutual Broadcasting System and president of such diverse companies as the J. W. Dant Distilling Company and the A. Hammer Pencil Company of New York, London and Moscow.
"I am first and foremost a catalyst -- I bring people and situations together," Dr. Hammer once said in discussing his long business career.
A short and forceful man with a quick smile appraising eyes,he became involved in American-Soviet trade very early, in 1921, and maintained ties with the Soviet Union for more than 60 years, with a hiatus during Stalin's ascendancy.
Dr. Hammer wrote in 1985 that his involvement with the Soviet Union reflected a belief "that nuclear war must be avoided and that the chances for peace can best be preserved by building the bonds of culture and commerce."
In the mid-1950's, already a multimillionaire, he invested in Occidental, then a small and struggling company. By 1986, after he had headed it for 29 years, he could boast that it had become "the eighth-biggest energy concern in the United States and the 12th-biggest industrial corporation," with gross revenues of about $16 billion that year.
As a businessman Dr. Hammer was inventive, daring and energetic. His talents brought him so much money that he said he could not count it, and he prolonged his business career into his nineties.
"I love business," he once said. "I love my work. I can't wait to start a new day."
 
His Motives Were Questioned
 Although he profited spectacularly from his dealings with the Soviet Union, his motives were sometimes questioned. He wrote in his best-selling autobiography, "Hammer," that his Russian-born father, Julius Hammer, was recruited, while a Connecticut steelworker, into the Socialist Labor Party. It was the leading Marxist party in the United States in the last quarter of the 19th century and a forerunner of the American Communist Party -- of which, Dr. Hammer wrote, his father was a founding member in 1919.
Some people contended that Dr. Hammer's early success in trading with the Soviet Union was nourished by Julius Hammer's connections in the Moscow Government. There were also insinuations that Dr. Hammer shared his father's political sympathies, a view he denied.
Nonetheless, Dr. Hammer sometimes expressed views of the Soviet Union that, coming from an American millionaire, seemed strikingly uncritical. In an article on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times in 1987, he and a co-author wrote that "to some extent, the Soviet Union lacks the delicate balance present in our society between technological achievements and human values."
In "Hammer," which came out in 1987, Dr. Hammer wrote that he had met with the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev many times, finding him "a man of great humanism and vast warmth."
Appraising the book in The New York Times Book Review, Ted Morgan contended that Dr. Hammer, "in order to maintain his 'most favored person' position with the Russians, becomes disturbingly sycophantic."
Mr. Morgan also contended that "Dr. Hammer presents himself as the architect of world peace, instrumental in arranging the 1985 Geneva summit between Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan" while "in fact, he is more like an enthusiastic amateur trying to break into the major leagues, a George Plimpton of international relations."
Dr. Hammer was also involved in United States politics. A lifelong Democrat, he was convicted in 1976 of making illegal campaign contributions totaling $54,000 to President Richard M. Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign, fined $3,000 and put on one year's probation. Years later Dr. Hammer contended that he should not have pleaded guilty and that he had been the victim of misdeeds by an associate, He was pardoned by
Despite the controversy Dr. Hammer sometimes aroused, he retained the friendship and esteem of many famous people. Two former presidents, Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter, endorsed his autobiography. Mr. Ford said Mr. Hammer was "a unique individual in the business and geopolitical world." Mr. Carter said he had "a unique standing in both the United States and the Soviet Union."
 
Art, Cattle, a Park And a Boeing 727
 Over the years, Dr. Hammer's various holdings, interests and possessions were staggeringly diverse. There was his own plane, a Boeing 727, in addition to the art galleries: the Hammer Galleries Inc. and Knoedler & Company, in New York City. He had on his desk in Los Angeles inscribed pictures of important people from Lenin to President Ronald Reagan. For a while, he owned Campobello Island, the Roosevelt family's retreat; he gave it to the United States and Canada in 1962 as an international park.
His purchases included champion Aberdeen Angus cattle and a costly Leonardo da Vinci manuscript, as well as the Hooker Chemical Company. During the nine years he spent in the Soviet Union, beginning in 1921, he invested in art works that he called treasures of the Romanovs -- the family of the Czars of Russia from 1613 until the Revolution in 1917.
Dr. Hammer gave away a great deal of the money that he made. "I have a seven-figure income and give away 90 percent of it," he said in 1980. He headed the Armand Hammer Foundation, which gave millions of dollars a year to charitable causes.
Some instances of his largesse were the $5 million that he gave to Columbia University in 1977; the 1,000 lithographs by Daumier that he gave to the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 1983, and the gift of $1 million to the Metropolitan Museum that was announced in 1986. Its purpose was to help renovate its arms and armor galleries at the museum. In recognition of his patronage of the arts, Dr. Hammer was chosen in 1987 to receive a National Medal for the Arts.
In 1988 he announced plans to build a $30 million cultural center and museum in Los Angeles for his art collections. The New York Times critic, John Russell, wrote at the time that "the collections are particularly strong in European Old Master paintings and drawings. Among the masters represented are Raphael, Correggio, Ingres, Rubens, Rembrandt, Watteau, Fragonard, Tiepolo, Boucher, Cezanne,Gauguin, Renoir and van Gogh."
Mr. Russell said Dr. Hammer's $250 million valuation of the collections was conservative.
Dr. Hammer also had what Mr. Russell called a remarkable collection of European Old Master drawings, which he gave it to the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
That same year Dr. Hammer initiated an ambitious, four-year campaign to raise $500 million from private sources for cancer research. The drive officially got under way in October 1988, but in its first few weeks only about $13 million in private funds was donated.
Dr. Hammer's role in the campaign stirred much praise and some misgivings. Some cancer researchers and specialists voiced concern that it might lead to too much money being put into research involving the body's immune defense system, a field in which he was particularly interested.
Named for Hero Or Socialist Symbol? Dr. Hammer was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan on May 21, 1898, the son of Julius Hammer and Rose Robinson Hammer. In "Hammer," Dr. Hammer wrote that his father named him Armand "after Armand Duval, the romantic hero in Dumas's 'La Dame aux Camelias,' although others suggested he obviously had in mind the symbol of the Socialist Labor Party -- an arm and a hammer."
Dr. Hammer's business career began when he was a medical student at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. In "Hammer," he wrote that his father, who had become a physician and a pharmaceuticals manufacturer, was in poor health and called on him to take over his business. The young Hammer did so and, while continuing his studies, prospered mightily. "Average income in the United States in 1919 was about $625 a year," he wrote, while "my personal income was over $1 million net."
When he graduated from medical school in 1921, he had six months to wait before beginning his internship. But other events intervened. There was a typhus epidemic, along with other problems, in the Soviet Union at the time, four years after the revolution; and he decided to go there, thinking he would work as a doctor. When he arrived, he found that the major problem was starvation, not typhus. Then, he wrote, "there came to me the single proposition which most dramatically changed my life" -- the idea, which he swiftly acted on, of trading American grain for furs and other goods from the Soviet Union.
Before long, Dr. Hammer attracted the attention of Lenin, who needed foreign investment and who gave the young American a concession for asbestos in the Urals. Dr. Hammer wrote in "Hammer" that the concession was not as successful as he himself had hoped, but it was the start of a profitable trading relationship. He soon became the representative of three dozen American companies.
 
Enter Stalin, Exit Hammer
 In 1925, he asked for a pencil concession. He received it, and with the aid of experts and technology from Germany, he produced $2.5 million worth of pencils in his first year. y 1930, he was employing 1,000 workers and producing nearly 500,000 pencils a day.
But Stalin came into power, and, he wrote, it was clear "that Stalin was not a man with whom you could do business." Mainly for that reason, he wrote, he left the Soviet Union.
In the decades that followed, Dr. Hammer made money in a variety of fields, including the sale of art that he had acquired in the Soviet Union, the production of beer and whiskey barrels and the operation of a number of distilleries. After greatly expanding sales at J. W. Dant Bonded Bourbon, he sold the distillery for $6.5 million and moved to California in 1955, thinking he would retire.
But unlimited leisure bored him, and he began investing in Occidental, which then had assets of less than $100,000. He found the oil business, he wrote years later, "more exciting, more interesting, more complex, riskier and more rewarding than any other business I had encountered."
In the late 1950's, he also invested in the Mutual Broadcasting System, and he ran that company for a time himself. But he sold out, for a profit of $1.3 million, he later recalled, partly because he was "much more excited about Occidental."
As chairman and chief executive of Occidental, he hired oil-industry experts, much as he had hired pencil-making experts 30 years before. The company grew, and by 1967 its assets were more than $1 billion.
In 1966, after years of intricate negotiations, Occidental Petroleum was awarded two oil concessions in Libya. Within two years, it was exporting more than 200,000 barrels of oil a day.
In 1973, Dr. Hammer's luck seemed to turn sour. Libya's radical new Government put pressure on Occidental, by then the country's largest single oil producer, and later that year, it turned over 51 percent of the company to the Government for $135 million. Occidental also agreed to higher taxes and a 30 percent price increase.
The move by Occidental, which soon led to similar accommodations by other oil producers in Libya, has been described as changing the world economy. It was the first time that an oil-producing country had dictated oil prices, and it set the stage for the dramatic increase in influence of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Nevertheless, Occidental continued to prosper, moving into oil production in Peru and the North Sea, among other areas.
 
New Troubles In the 1970's
 In the 1970's, Dr. Hammer's free-wheeling business style brought him different kinds of trouble. A successful battle by the Mead Corporation, an Ohio-based forest products company, to resist a takeover by Occidental turned up information that prompted Federal and state investigations into Dr. Hammer's and Occidental's activities.
According to informants close to the takeover attempt, Occidental abandoned the move after investigators began looking into Dr. Hammer's art dealings. One allegation that was bruited about, although he contended it was only "a lot of gossip," was that he had made an improper payment of $100,000 in the early 1970's to the Soviet Minister of Culture, Yekaterina A. Furtseva, to facilitate an art exchange.
His involvement with the Soviet Union continued into the 1980's. After the nuclear power plant leak in 1986 at Chernobyl, he dispatched an international group of physicians to deliver medicine and medical care. In that same year, after he had conferred with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, works of art that he had collected went on display in Soviet cities.
Also in 1986, the Soviet authorities permitted Dr. Hammer to take an ailing Jewish scientist, David Goldfarb, from a hospital in Moscow and fly him and his wife to the United States.
Even in his 90's Dr. Hammer remained prominent in Occidental's management and continued to personify the company. Through the decades, he was also variously a director of numerous organizations and business concerns, including banks and companies in the petroleum industry and other fields.
In 1986 he became affiliated with the Church & Dwight Company, which makes Arm & Hammer, the baking soda brand, when Occidental bought a stake in the company. It was not the first time Dr. Hammer had sought the company. He once told an interviewer that he was often asked if he owned Arm & Hammer. "A few years ago," he said, "I offered to buy it so I could say yes. But the owners didn't want to sell."
It was announced in 1987 that Dr. Hammer was donating a substantial collection of his personal papers, including documents involving Soviet leaders, to the Library of Congress.
He was awarded a Soviet decoration, the Order of Friendship Among Peoples, and others from several other nations.
Dr. Hammer was married three times, the first time in 1927 to a Russian singer, Olga von Root, by whom he had a son, his only child, Julian. The marriage ended in divorce, as did his second marriage, to Angela Carey Zevely in 1934. In 1956, he married Frances Barrett, a painter, of Beverly Hills, Calif. Mrs. Hammer, who often accompanied her husband on international business trips, died in December, 1989, from pneumonia, following surgery for a broken hip.
In addition to his son, Julian, he is survived by a grandson, Michael A. Hammer; a granddaughter, Casey Hammer, and two great-grandchildren.,

HEADLINE: Martin Ritt, Director, Dead at 76; Maker of Socially Conscious Films

BYLINE: By PETER B. FLINT

 BODY:
Martin Ritt, a director admired for making films that explored moral choices and reflected concern for racially and economically oppressed people, died on Saturday in Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center in California. He was 76 years old and lived in Pacific Palisades, Calif.
The film maker died of heart disease, a family spokesman said. 
 Beginning in 1957, Mr. Ritt directed and occasionally co-produced 25 diverse films, including "Edge of the City," "The Long Hot Summer," "Hud," "The Spy Who Came In From the Cold," "Sounder," "Pete 'n' Tillie," "Norma Rae," "Murphy's Romance," "Nuts" and "Stanley and Iris."
Most of his films were quietly moving studies of human relationships, punctuated by periodic hits that gave the husky, tough-minded director freedom to deal with social issues and the alienation of outsiders.
 
'The Human Condition'
 Critics argued that his idealism made some of his work sentimental and susceptible to sugar-coated themes and happily-ever-after endings. In rebuttal, he said in 1986 that "most of my pictures are concerned with the human condition."
Speaking in the gravelly rhythms of the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where he grew up, he added, "I'm also very committed to assuming responsibility for one's actions." The concern, he said, was rooted in part in his experience of being blacklisted in the 1950's for past Communist ties. He bitterly skewered the era in his 1976 film "The Front."
Mr. Ritt was known as an actor's director who enhanced many careers and was widely admired, although he was nominated for an Academy Award only once, in 1963 for "Hud," an incisive character drama that won Oscars for Patricia Neal, Melvyn Douglas and the cinematographer James Wong Howe.
"I make the kind of films that not too many people get to make in this town, though sometimes I've had to take the risk myself," he said in 1986. To make both "Sounder," a 1972 tale of black sharecroppers during the Depression, and "Norma Rae," a 1979 story about a struggle to unionize a cotton mill in the South, he said, he and most of the principals worked for far less than their normal salaries, in exchange for a percentage of any profits, which were ultimately considerable.
 
An Unobtrusive Hand
 Mr. Ritt directed his camera the way he directed actors, with restraint, favoring a linear, sequential technique and eschewing flashy camera angles and shots and editing. "I don't use the zoom unless that's the only way I can get into a scene," he once said. "The audience shouldn't be aware of the director's work until the movie's over."
Martin Ritt was born to immigrant parents in Manhattan on March 2, 1914. He graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx and Elon College in North Carolina, where he was a running guard and a boxer. He began studying law at St. John's University, but he met and befriended Elia Kazan and joined him in New York's Group Theater, where he acted in "Golden Boy" and other socially conscious Depression-era plays.
He served in the Air Force in World War II, appearing in the service's stage and film drama "Winged Victory." After the war, he acted in live television plays but increasingly stressed directing. He was then blacklisted for five years and eked out a living by teaching at the Actors Studio.
He began film directing in 1957 with "Edge of the City," a powerfully realistic waterfront drama with racial overtones and starring John Cassavetes and Sidney Poitier.
Mr. Ritt is survived by his wife, Adele; a daughter, Martina Werner, a film producer, of Los Angeles, and a son, Michael, of Alaska.

HEADLINE: Seoul Begins Talks on Soviet Trade

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 11

 BODY:
In a bold drive to line up with several more prosperous Western nations helping the Soviet Union, South Korea has started talks with Moscow that officials here say could lead to several billion dollars in trade, investment and aid in the next five years.
On Thursday, President Roh Tae Woo is to become the first leader of South Korea to visit the Soviet Union, a trip scheduled less than three months after the two countries established diplomatic relations, formally ending a long period of hostility dating from the Korean War 40 years ago. 
 The trip, announced last week, is seen as overshadowing the third round of talks between senior leaders of North and South Korea, to begin Wednesday in Seoul amid signs of a stalemate over steps to reduce tensions.
The North Korean delegation arrived this morning, a relief for those South Korean officials who worried that the talks would be called off by Pyongyang out of pique over Seoul's new cooperation with its longtime patron.
 
Political Stature Is Goal
 The South Korean strategy seems to be to gain political stature and turn to its own advantage Moscow's economic problems, particularly the restiveness of disgruntled and desperate Soviet consumers.
For example, Mr. Roh is going to Moscow with the heads of 20 major companies said to be interested in joint ventures in the Soviet Union to produce televisions, soap, shoes, refrigerators and dozens of other goods that Koreans have proven they know how to make.
"I think trade and investment could reach several billion dollars in the next five years," said Koo Bon Yong, Secretary for Economic Affairs to President Roh. "We want to expand trade and start as many mutually profitable investments as possible, for both political and economic reasons."
No one believes that South Korea's relatively small economy is strong enough to rescue the Soviet economy, but with the United States economically strapped and Japan staying on the sidelines because of a territorial dispute with Moscow, South Korea could fill some of the gaps.
 
Isolating the North
 Indeed, diplomats say a web of cooperative ventures, including possible joint development of natural resources, could have far-reaching political ramifications. It would strengthen Mr. Roh's attempt, for instance, to improve ties with China and what was once the Soviet bloc, further isolating North Korea.
The Soviet-Korean talks have in fact begun to alarm Japanese businessmen, who are avoiding joint ventures out of fear of Russian economic instability and because of their Government's insistence on first resolving the territorial matter.
Mr. Roh, in Moscow, is expected to meet with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and sign four separate treaties to encourage trade, scientific cooperation and South Korean investment.
Moreover, officials said that South Korea, which only 15 years ago was receiving economic aid from the United States, is ready to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in credits to let Moscow import commodities and, eventually, the factory equipment to produce the commodities itself.
 
Insurance and Credit
 Mr. Koo, the economic adviser, said Seoul was considering establishing a Government insurance fund for companies that want to export but worry about being paid quickly, plus a line of credit of several hundred million dollars to the Russians for consumer items and manufactured goods.
"As Korean exports increase, we may need more such mechanisms," said Mr. Koo. He added that trade between South Korea and the Soviet Union is expected to be about a billion dollars this year, more than three times what it was a year ago.
South Koreans assert their country may be ideally positioned, even more than Japan, Europe or the United States, to provide middle- and low-level production technology that has made its economy a model for development.
"Korean businessmen have a gung-ho spirit," said a South Korean diplomat. "These guys are coming along with us to Moscow because, frankly, we want to see how they negotiate with the Russians. Eventually, if there is a financing problem, we'll consider how to help solve it."
 
3 Joint Ventures
 Three joint ventures have already started. The Jindo Fur Company this fall began a joint manufacturing operation in Moscow to make and sell fur coats. The Hyundai Group is engaged in another joint venture to produce timber in the eastern Soviet Union.
And the Samsung Business Group, after being rebuffed with a proposal to put up a hotel in Moscow, is negotiating to refurbish an existing hotel and run it under a management contract. The group is also negotiating to export videotape recorder parts and components to be assembled in the Soviet Union.

Massachusetts Prices Bonds With a Top Yield of 7.80%

 BODY:
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts priced $526 million in general obligation bonds yesterday through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. Initial pricing produced a maximum yield of 7.80 percent for an issue that is due to mature in 2007.
About $475 million of the financing consists of just two maturities, a bond due in 2007 and a bond issue due 2010, which was priced to yield 7.75 percent. For shorter maturities, the yields are 7.50 percent for an issue due in 1998, 7.55 percent in 1999 and 7.60 percent in 2000.
Investors are also offered capital appreciation bonds, which are zero-coupon bonds that pay no interest, but if held to maturity will yield 7.70 percent. An issue due in 2004 is offered at a price of $348.54 for $1,000 in bonds and a bond due in 2005 is priced at $323.18 for $1,000 in bonds.
Underwriters said the financing was rated Baa by Moody's Investors Service, BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation and A by Fitch Investors Service Inc.
Moody's said its Baa rating "reflected the as yet uncertain effect of the commonwealth's efforts to restore financial control, high debt load, poor liquidity, and the adverse impact of a continuing economic downturn."
The rating agency noted that the state's net tax-supported debt, including this issue, is $10.6 billion. Last year Massachusetts spent an estimated $873.8 million in debt service payments, and the projected figure for the fiscal year 1992 is $1.065 billion, not including this issue of general obligation bonds.

First Interstate Sale Suggested

 BODY:
Marvin Davis, the investor and oilman, said yesterday in a letter to directors of the First Interstate Bancorp that the Los Angeles-based bank holding company should "either achieve the operating economies that are long overdue or consider the sale of the bank to another banking institution."
In the letter, which Mr. Davis distributed as a news release, Mr. Davis said he was distressed by the company's "deteriorating financial condition" and declines in its stock in recent months. 
 Mr. Davis did not disclose his family's stake in First Interstate, but analysts said the position must be less than 5 percent because any investments that size or larger must be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
"We take Mr. Davis's concerns seriously as we do the concerns of all our shareholders," said Simon Barker-Benfield, a spokesman for First Interstate. He said that under the management team that took control of the company this year, First Interstate had "returned to profitabilty and made a dramatic improvement" in its capital position.
First Interstate earned $155.4 million in the third quarter, up from a loss of nearly $15.6 million a year earlier. A sale of new shares earlier this year plus profits earned since the end of 1989 have raised the company's equity capital to more than $2.3 billion in the third quarter, compared with $1.97 billion in the first quarter.
First Interstate's stock closed at $25.125 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, up 37.5 cents, and well above its low of $15.625 in the third quarter.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
New Chip Method May Be Put Off

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Advances in manufacturing computer chips promise to allow the existing technique to be used for many more years than was previously thought possible, postponing or maybe eliminating entirely the need for costly new technologies, semiconductor industry experts say. The advances seem to raise questions about the urgency of efforts to develop a competing technology, to which Congress has allocated $60 million for the current fiscal year and to which Japanese companies are also devoting money.
For years, experts have been predicting that the existing process for etching microscopic circuit patterns on silicon wafers was about to become outmoded. The process, known as optical lithography, uses light to shrink a chip-circuitry pattern onto a wafer of silicon.
 
Like a Very Sharp Pencil
 But as circuits continue to be made smaller in an effort to place more computing power on each chip, they are getting as small as the wavelength of light. Trying to make such intricate circuits with light is like trying to paint a thin line with a wide brush. 
 That prospect has led to worried calls for the creation of a large Government-industry program to develop an exotic and costly new technology known as X-ray lithography. By comparison to light, X-rays, which have a far shorter wavelength, are like a very sharp pencil, and can therefore be used to develop the smaller circuits necessary for future generations of chips.
But now, a growing number of experts say optical lithography should be able to carry the semiconductor industry at least until the turn of the century and possibly beyond, relieving the pressure to develop X-ray lithography or other new technologies like one that uses electron beams to write patterns.
"The window for using X-rays keeps getting pushed out," said Thomas E. Seidel, vice president for manufacturing equipment and materials for Sematech, the consortium working on advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques.
Being able to stay with the existing technology could have enormous economic implications for semiconductor companies. A chip production plant using X-ray lithography promises to cost at least $500 million, at least $200 million more than an equivalent plant using optical lithography, some experts say.
 
Welcome News in U.S.
 That would be welcome news for American semiconductor companies, which by and large are smaller than their Japanese rivals and would have trouble affording X-ray lithography factories.
Also, there is concern that the Japanese companies are outspending the United States on X-ray lithography. There are more than a dozen programs in Japan, both individual company efforts and consortiums.
In the United States, I.B.M. is the only company with a major program in X-rays, although A.T.& T. is doing some work and Motorola is working with I.B.M. Much of the rest of the work is being done at national laboratories and universities with the $60 million in financing from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
Still, how advances in optical lithography will affect the competitive picture is not entirely clear. Japanese companies now lead in producing and using the current generation of optical lithography equipment, so anything that prolongs use of that equipment could help them as well.
 
Technique Applied by Japanese
 The latest developments in optical lithography are being introduced here this week at the International Electron Devices Meeting. Researchers from several Japanese companies are discussing a new technique, known as phase shifting, that promises to extend the usefulness of optical lithography for at least several years.
Scientists from Fujitsu, for instance, used the technique to manufacture a 64-megabit dynamic random access memory chip using their existing lithography equipment. Such a chip can store 64 million pieces of data, 16 times more than the most advanced chip now on the market, which is the four-megabit D-RAM. It was previously thought that existing lithography equipment could not make chips more complex than a 16-megabit D-RAM.
"This is a very exciting result because it may push optical lithography another generation," said Steven J. Hillenius, a semiconductor expert at A.T.& T. Bell Laboratories.
The sudden flurry of activity in phase-shifting technology by the Japanese electrified some American researchers. The technique was first proposed by Mark Levenson of I.B.M. about 10 years ago, but has not been applied until now.
 
'Caught Off Guard'
 "We have pretty much been caught off guard by it," said Rick Sivan, manager of advanced technology development at Motorola Inc. in Austin, Tex., referring to American companies. "My worry is we probably have not put enough effort in it."
But some experts say X-ray lithography will still be needed. They say that while phase shifting looks promising in the laboratory, it might be difficult to use in mass production.
Moreover, as optical lithography is pushed to make more and more intricate chips, it will become increasingly expensive. At some point, X-ray technology will triumph because of basic physics.
"Eventually, the economics is going to make it inescapable that you're going to have to go to shorter wavelengths," said Paul M. Horn, director of silicon technology at I.B.M.'s T. J. Watson Research Center. I.B.M. has been the most active in pursuing X-ray lithography.
 
Hedging Their Bets
 However, some detractors who have raised questions about the need for X-ray lithography any time soon say it is the technology of the future -- and always will be.
"Most people can't demonstrate there's any reason for doing it other than that the Japanese are doing it," said G. Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research, a San Jose market research firm that specializes in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.
But he and some others said even Japanese companies, despite participating in several highly publicized cooperative efforts to develop X-ray lithography, were merely hedging their bets while concentrating their best efforts on optical lithography.
 
'It's Not Useful'
 "X-ray technology is very interesting to develop, but it's not useful," said Kenji Nakagawa, the section manager at Fujitsu Ltd. who was presenting the company's paper on phase-shifting technology at this week's conference. Mr. Nakagawa, who worked on X-ray development two years ago but shifted to optical lithography, said he was offering a personal opinion that might not represent his company's.
Optical lithography has already proved more resilient than expected, partly because so much effort is being put into it that it becomes a moving target for other technologies to catch.
"Everybody's waiting for this heavyweight champ to retire,' said Martin E. Lepselter, president of Lepton Inc., a Murray Hill, N.J., company that makes electron-beam equipment. "He doesn't want to retire. He keeps batting down everyone that gets in the ring with him."
Optical lithography is a process similar to one in which light is used to enlarge a photograph from a negative, only in this case it is used to shrink an image. The pattern of the circuit is made on a mask, which is like a photographic negative. Light shines through lenses and the mask, and the pattern is reproduced, in smaller size, on a silicon wafer that is coated with photosensitive materials.
Currently, the most advanced chips have circuits a little less than one micron wide. A micron is a millionth of a meter and about one one-hundredth the thickness of a human hair.
That is approaching the wavelength of the light use to make such circuits, which is about 0.4 micron. X-rays, by contrast, have wavelengths of about 0.001 micron.
 
Lenses and Chemicals Improved
 About 10 years ago, some chip designers thought optical lithography would prove unable to make circuits with features smaller than 0.8 micron, the size of the circuits in the four-megabit D-RAM, which is just coming to market. As little as two years ago, people said new technologies would be needed when circuit widths reached 0.5 micron, the size needed for the 16-megabit D-RAM, which should make its debut in two or three years.
Those predictions proved unfounded, in part because lenses and photosensitive chemicals were improved.
Now, two alternative approaches promise to allow optical lithography to move down to 0.35 micron, the size needed to make the 64-megabit D-RAM, which should begin appearing by about 1995. If these approaches are combined, optical lithography might be able to produce circuits of 0.2 micron, enough for the 256-megabit D-RAM that is expected to reach the market late in the decade.
It is even possible, some say, that optical lithography will be able to reach 0.1 micron, enough for a one-billion-bit chip that would appear after the year 2000.
 
Shorter Wavelengths
 One of the new approaches is to use shorter wavelengths of light. Some newer machines use lasers or other approaches to produce invisible ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 0.25 micron. There is research under way toward using light with a wavelength of 0.19 micron. American companies lead in the development of such low wavelength light, which is difficult to produce.
The other approach, phase shifting, might allow conventional lithography equipment, with 0.4 micron light, to make circuits with features smaller than that.
To use the paint brush analogy, it would seem impossible to paint a green stripe 0.2 micron wide using a brush that is 0.4 micron wide. But that brush could be used to paint two wide stripes side by side that overlap by 0.2 micron. One stripe would be painted blue and the other yellow. Where they overlap would be a green stripe 0.2 micron wide.
That is exactly how phase shifting works, except it uses two phases of light rather than colors of paint.
In conventional lithography, the mask has transparent areas and opaque areas, like a photographic negative. But the light going through the transparent areas bends slightly, so that the image formed on the silicon wafer is slightly blurry. When the circuit features are large, this blurring is not noticeable, but it becomes a problem as circuit elements become as small as the wavelength of the light.
With phase shifting, masks have two different transparent areas, rather than transparent and opaque areas. One of the transparent areas is thicker than the other.
Light moving through glass slows down, so light moving through the thicker glass will go more slowly than the light going through the thin glass. If the thicknesses are precisely set, the light going through the thicker glass will emerge 180 degrees out of phase with the light going through the thinner glass.
Because the light bends as it travels through the mask, light from the two different mask regions overlaps slightly where they hit the wafer. But because the light beams are out of phase, the peaks of one are canceled by the valleys of the other and a very narrow dark spot emerges. The bending of light is turned from a problem into a way of making tiny dark patterns on the chip.
The main drawback of phase shifting is that it is very difficult to manufacture and test the masks.
 
A BETTER WAY TO MAKE COMPUTER CHIPS
 
Computer chips are made by printing tiny patterns of circuitry into silicon with light, in a procedure called optical lithography. But as circuits have become smaller and smaller, chip makers have needed to develop ways to make lithography more precise, including a method called phase-shifting.
 
CONVENTIONAL LITHOGRAPHY
 
In conventional procedures, a mask is covered with chrome in some places to block light. Light shines through the holes in the mask onto a silicon wafer treated with light-sensitive material. But because light waves bend as they pass through the mask, it is hard to achieve a sharp edge between the exposed and unexposed areas on the silicon wafer.
 
"PHASE-SHIFTED" LITHOGRAPHY
 
Phase-shifting uses a mask that varies in thickness. Light waves passing through the thicker parts of the mask emerge "out of phase" with light passing through the thinner parts. Where the two phases of light overlap they are canceled out, as the two waves exactly oppose each other. This produces a sharper dark pattern on the wafer.

Dollar Strengthens on Plans For Talks to Halt Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar strengthened against leading currencies yesterday, largely on news that a group of industrialized nations planned to meet to halt its decline.
Foreign exchange dealers were warmed by news that the so-called Group of Seven -- the United States, Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- would meet in January to discuss the dollar's recent decline. 
 "People are presuming -- with a capital 'P' -- that the outcome will be possibly an attempt to stabilize the dollar," said Robert Hatcher, corporate foreign exchange dealer for Barclays Bank P.L.C.
 
Weak Mark Also Helped
 Analysts said the dollar was also supported by a weakening of the mark after Germany's central bank announced that it was not planning to raise interest rates on Thursday. Traders had speculated that the Bundesbank would tighten its credit policy, which could have lifted the mark against foreign currencies.
The two events combined to bounce the dollar off earlier lows, analysts said.
Within two hours yesterday morning, the dollar jumped in value from 1.4680 German marks to 1.4810. Much of those gains were sustained, with the dollar closing up 1.4784 German marks, compared with 1.4725 late Monday.
"Basically the situation with the dollar was pretty much a complete turnaround from the morning," Mr. Hatcher said.
 
Dollar Up Against Yen
 The dollar also gained against the Japanese yen in New York, closing at 132.40 yen, up from 132.15 yen late Monday. In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 131.75 yen, from 130.55 at the Monday close. In London, it was quoted at a rate of 131.95 yen.
The British pound weakened to $1.9380 in New York, compared with $1.9442 at the Monday close. In London, it fell to $1.9400, from $1.9450 late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with the late Monday prices, included: 1.2650 Swiss francs, up from 1.2615; 5.0190 French francs, up from 5.0050; 1,114.00 Italian lire, up from 1,112.25, and 1.1606 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1572.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with those of late Monday, included: 1.4790 German marks, up from 1.4708; 2.2665 Swiss francs, up from 1.2610; 5.0230 French francs, up from 4.9980; 1.6683 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6585; 1,110.07 Italian lire, up from 1,109.75, and 1.1591 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1566.
Silver rose on the Commodity Exchange in New York to $4.067 an ounce, up 1.7 cents. Silver also rose in London to a late bid price of $4.06 an ounce, from $4.05 bid late Monday.

HEADLINE: Armand Hammer Dies at 92; Industrialist and Philanthropist Forged Soviet Links

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Armand Hammer, the chairman of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation who long sought peace between the United States and the Soviet Union and financed research for a cancer cure, died at his home in Los Angeles Monday night. He was 92 years old.
The cause of death was not disclosed but associates said he had been suffering from kidney problems. Frank Ashley, a spokesman for Occidental, said the death occurred after "a brief illness." 
 Dr. Hammer, who at one time or another headed successful businesses in fields ranging from art to bourbon whisky, built and led Occidental for 33 years. Ray R. Irani, the company's president and chief operating officer, immediately succeeded Dr. Hammer as chairman and chief executive officer.
Dr. Hammer, who was trained as a physician but never set up a medical practice, was also a noted philanthropist and art collector who hobnobbed with the high and mighty, including members of the British royal family and generations of Soviet leaders.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union sent condolences to the Hammer family and said in a statement that Dr. Hammer helped forge Soviet-American relations. He "was associated with one of the most remarkable pages of our relationship," Mr. Gorbachev added. "He met with Lenin and was very close in many ways to the Soviet Union, and to Russia."
Experts in different fields that Dr. Hammer was active in gave varying appraisals of him in interviews yesterday.
Daniel Yergin, an author and the president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm. said Dr. Hammer's life straddled "the whole history" of the 20th century. "He was virtually the only one who could tell Mikhail Gorbachev firsthand what Lenin was like, Gorbachev having been born" seven years after Lenin died.
 
'A Very Minor Figure' In U.S.-Soviet Relations
 Richard Pipes, the Baird Professor of History at Harvard and a specialist in modern Russian history, said that, "in terms of U.S.S.R. internal developments and U.S.-Soviet relations, he was a very minor figure."
"I don't think he was a man who in any way sympathized with the regime," Mr. Pipes added. "He basically entered into relations with the Soviet Government in the early period and again later purely for making a profit and enhancing his stature."
Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, said Dr. Hammer "was as aggressive and wily in his dealings in the art world as he seems to have been in other aspects of his life."
"He was a dealer, collector and impresario of art," Mr. Kimmelman added, "but it's not clear whether in the end he served his own interests best by building a monument to his own collection in the form of the Armand Hammer museum in Los Angeles instead of donating the works to another museum that could have edited the wheat from the chaff and therefore made the best case for Hammer's taste."
Dr. Hammer bequeathed his art collection to the new museum, which was opened in Los Angeles on Nov. 28 in a zebra-striped building that adjoins the headquarters of Occidental.
Last summer, the heirs of Dr. Hammer's late wife, Frances, who died last year at 87, filed a lawsuit contending that Dr. Hammer had tricked her into signing away her part of their collection, valued at $400 million. Dr. Hammer called the charges scurrilous.
 
From a Bar Mitzvah To a Memorial Service
 Dr. Hammer had planned to celebrate his own belated bar mitzvah last night, like much of what he did, in public. Dr. Hammer, who was raised in a non-observant family, planned to link the ceremony to a fund-raising dinner at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. The dinner was to benefit two organizations, the Pacific Jewish Center and the Jerusalem College of Technology.
The ceremony was changed into a memorial service. "We're going to go ahead with the event," a spokesman, Howard Bragman, said. "It's really the wish of Dr. Hammer that this event continue because it was important to him."
Funeral arrangements were pending. Dr. Hammer will be entombed in the private Hammer family mausoleum at Westwood Village Cemetery, just a few hundred yards from Occidental's headquarters.
Over the years, Dr. Hammer was variously president and chairman of the Mutual Broadcasting System and president of such diverse companies as the J. W. Dant Distilling Company and the A. Hammer Pencil Company of New York, London and Moscow. "I am first and foremost a catalyst, I bring people and situations together," Dr. Hammer once said in discussing his long business career.
A short and forceful man with a quick smile and appraising eyes, he became involved in American-Soviet trade very early, in 1921, and maintained ties with the Soviet Union for more than 60 years, with a hiatus during Stalin's ascendancy.
Dr. Hammer wrote in 1985 that his involvement with the Soviet Union reflected a belief "that nuclear war must be avoided and that the chances for peace can best be preserved by building the bonds of culture and commerce."
 
Small and Struggling Occidental Transformed
 In the mid-1950's, already a multimillionaire, he invested in Occidental, then a small and struggling company. By 1986, after he had headed it for 29 years, he could boast that it had become "the eighth-biggest energy concern in the United States and the 12th-biggest industrial corporation," with gross revenues of about $16 billion that year.
As a businessman Dr. Hammer was inventive, daring and energetic. His talents brought him so much money that he said he could not count it, and he prolonged his business career into his 90's. "I love business," he once said. "I love my work. I can't wait to start a new day."
Although he profited spectacularly from his dealings with the Soviet Union, his motives were sometimes questioned. He wrote in his best-selling autobiography, "Hammer," that his Russian-born father, Julius Hammer, was recruited, while a Connecticut steelworker, into the Socialist Labor Party. It was the leading Marxist party in the United States in the last quarter of the 19th century and a forerunner of the American Communist Party, of which, Dr. Hammer wrote, his father was a founding member in 1919.
Some people contended that Dr. Hammer's early success in trading with the Soviet Union was nourished by Julius Hammer's connections in the Moscow Government. There were also insinuations that Dr. Hammer shared his father's political sympathies, a view he denied.
Nonetheless, Dr. Hammer sometimes expressed views of the Soviet Union that coming from an American millionaire seemed strikingly uncritical. In an article on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times in 1987, he and a co-author wrote that, "to some extent, the Soviet Union lacks the delicate balance present in our society between technological achievements and human values."
In "Hammer," which came out in 1987, Dr. Hammer wrote that he had met with Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, many times, finding him "a man of great humanism and vast warmth."
Appraising the book in The New York Times Book Review, Ted Morgan contended that Dr. Hammer, "in order to maintain his 'most favored person' position with the Russians, becomes disturbingly sycophantic."
 
'Enthusiastic Amateur' On International Ties
 Mr. Morgan also contended that "Dr. Hammer presents himself as the architect of world peace, instrumental in arranging the 1985 Geneva summit between Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan" while "in fact, he is more like an enthusiastic amateur trying to break into the major leagues, a George Plimpton of international relations."
Dr. Hammer was also involved in United States politics. A lifelong Democrat, he was convicted in 1976 of making illegal campaign contributions totaling $54,000 to President Richard M. Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign, fined $3,000 and put on one year's probation. Years later Dr. Hammer contended that he should not have pleaded guilty and that he had been the victim of misdeeds by an associate. He was pardoned by President Bush in August 1989.
Despite the controversy Dr. Hammer sometimes aroused, he retained the friendship and esteem of many famous people. Two former Presidents, Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter, endorsed his autobiography. Mr. Ford said Mr. Hammer was "a unique individual in the business and geopolitical world." Mr. Carter said he had "a unique standing in both the United States and the Soviet Union."
Over the years, Dr. Hammer's various holdings, interests and possessions were staggeringly diverse. There was his own plane, a Boeing 727, in addition to art galleries: Hammer Galleries Inc. and Knoedler & Company, in New York City. He had on his desk in Los Angeles inscribed pictures of important people from Lenin to President Reagan. For a while, he owned Campobello Island, the Roosevelt family's retreat; he gave it to the United States and Canada in 1962 as an international park.
 
Leonardo Manuscript And Prize Cattle Bought
 His purchases included champion Aberdeen Angus cattle and a costly Leonardo da Vinci manuscript, as well as the Hooker Chemical Company. During the nine years he spent in the Soviet Union, beginning in 1921, he invested in art works that he called treasures of the Romanovs, the family of the Czars of Russia from 1613 until the revolution in 1917.
Dr. Hammer gave away a great deal of the money that he made. "I have a seven-figure income and give away 90 percent of it," he said in 1980. He headed the Armand Hammer Foundation, which gave millions of dollars a year to charitable causes.
Some instances of his largesse were the $5 million that he gave to Columbia University in 1977; the 1,000 lithographs by Daumier that he gave to the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 1983, and the gift of $1 million to the Metropolitan Museum that was announced in 1986. Its purpose was to help renovate its arms and armor galleries at the museum. In recognition of his patronage of the arts, Dr. Hammer was chosen in 1987 to receive a National Medal for the Arts.
In 1988 he announced plans to build a $30 million cultural center and museum in Los Angeles for his art collections. The New York Times critic, John Russell, wrote at the time that "the collections are particularly strong in European Old Master paintings and drawings. Among the masters represented are Raphael, Correggio, Ingres, Rubens, Rembrandt, Watteau, Fragonard, Tiepolo, Boucher, Cezanne, Gauguin, Renoir and van Gogh."
Mr. Russell said Dr. Hammer's $250 million valuation of the collections was conservative.
Dr. Hammer also had what Mr. Russell called a remarkable collection of European Old Master drawings, which he gave to the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
 
Praise and Misgivings On Cancer Research Aid
 That same year Dr. Hammer initiated an ambitious four-year campaign to raise $500 million from private sources for cancer research. The drive officially got under way in October 1988, but in its first few weeks only about $13 million in private funds was donated. Dr. Hammer's role in the campaign stirred much praise and some misgivings. Some cancer researchers and specialists voiced concern that it might lead to too much money being put into research involving the body's immune defense system, a field in which he was particularly interested.
Dr. Hammer was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan on May 21, 1898, the son of Julius Hammer and Rose Robinson Hammer. In "Hammer," Dr. Hammer wrote that his father named him Armand "after Armand Duval, the romantic hero in Dumas's 'La Dame aux Camelias,' although others suggested he obviously had in mind the symbol of the Socialist Labor Party -- an arm and a hammer."
Dr. Hammer's business career began when he was a medical student at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. In "Hammer," he wrote that his father, who had become a physician and a pharmaceuticals manufacturer, was in poor health and called on him to take over his business. The young Hammer did so and, while continuing his studies, prospered mightily. "Average income in the United States in 1919 was about $625 a year," he wrote, while "my personal income was over $1 million net."
 
Starvation, Not Typhus, Soviet Problem in 20's
 When he graduated from medical school in 1921, he had six months to wait before beginning his internship. But other events intervened. There was a typhus epidemic, along with other problems, in the Soviet Union at the time, four years after the revolution, and he decided to go there, thinking he would work as a doctor. When he arrived, he found that the major problem was starvation, not typhus. Then, he wrote, "there came to me the single proposition which most dramatically changed my life" -- the idea, which he swiftly acted on, of trading American grain for furs and other goods from the Soviet Union.
Before long, Dr. Hammer attracted the attention of Lenin, who needed foreign investment and who gave the young American a concession for asbestos in the Urals. Dr. Hammer wrote in "Hammer" that the concession was not as successful as he himself had hoped, but it was the start of a profitable trading relationship. He soon became the representative of three dozen American companies.
In 1925, he asked for a pencil concession. He received it, and with the aid of experts and technology from Germany, he produced $2.5 million worth of pencils in his first year. By 1930, he was employing 1,000 workers and producing nearly 500,000 pencils a day.
But Stalin came into power, and, he wrote, it was clear "that Stalin was not a man with whom you could do business." Mainly for that reason, he wrote, he left the Soviet Union.
In the decades that followed, Dr. Hammer made money in a variety of fields, including the sale of art that he had acquired in the Soviet Union, the production of beer and whisky barrels and the operation of a number of distilleries. After greatly expanding sales at J. W. Dant Bonded Bourbon, he sold the distillery for $6.5 million and moved to California in 1955, thinking he would retire.
 
Bored by Life of Leisure, Excited by Oil Business
 But unlimited leisure bored him, and he began investing in Occidental, which then had assets of less than $100,000. He found the oil business, he wrote years later, "more exciting, more interesting, more complex, riskier and more rewarding than any other business I had encountered."
In the late 1950's, he also invested in the Mutual Broadcasting System, and he ran that company for a time himself. But he sold out, for a profit of $1.3 million, he later recalled, partly because he was "much more excited about Occidental."
As chairman and chief executive of Occidental, he hired oil-industry experts, much as he had hired pencil-making experts 30 years before. The company grew, and by 1967 its assets amounted to more than $1 billion.
In 1966, after years of intricate negotiations, Occidental was awarded two oil concessions in Libya. Within two years it was exporting more than 200,000 barrels of oil a day.
In 1973, Dr. Hammer's luck seemed to turn sour. Libya's radical new Government put pressure on Occidental, by then the country's largest single oil producer, and later that year it turned over 51 percent of the company to the Government for $135 million. Occidental also agreed to higher taxes and a 30 percent price increase.
The move by Occidental, which soon led to similar accommodations by other oil producers in Libya, has been described as changing the world economy. It was the first time that an oil-producing country had dictated oil prices, and it set the stage for the dramatic increase in influence of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Nevertheless, Occidental continued to prosper, moving into oil production in Peru and the North Sea, among other areas.
 
Free-Wheeling Style Brings Business Fights
 In the 1970's, Dr. Hammer's free-wheeling business style brought him different kinds of trouble. A successful battle by the Mead Corporation, an Ohio-based forest products company, to resist a takeover by Occidental turned up information that prompted Federal and state investigations into the activities of Dr. Hammer and Occidental.
According to people close to the takeover attempt, Occidental abandoned the move after investigators began looking into Dr. Hammer's art dealings. One allegation that was bruited about, although he contended it was only "a lot of gossip," was that he had made an improper payment of $100,000 in the early 1970's to the Soviet Minister of Culture, Yekaterina A. Furtseva, to facilitate an art exchange.
His involvement with the Soviet Union continued into the 1980's. After the nuclear power plant leak in 1986 at Chernobyl, he dispatched an international group of physicians to deliver medicine and medical care. In that same year, after he had conferred with Mr. Gorbachev, works of art that he had collected went on display in Soviet cities.
Also in 1986, the Soviet authorities permitted Dr. Hammer to take an ailing Jewish scientist, David Goldfarb, from a hospital in Moscow and fly him and his wife to the United States.
Even in his 90's Dr. Hammer remained prominent in Occidental's management and continued to personify the company. Through the decades, he was also variously a director of numerous organizations and business concerns, including banks and companies in the petroleum industry and other fields.
 
Bids Made to Acquire Arm & Hammer Brand
 In 1986 he became affiliated with the Church & Dwight Company, which makes Arm & Hammer, the baking soda brand, when Occidental bought a stake in the company. It was not the first time Dr. Hammer had sought the company. He once told an interviewer that he was often asked if he owned Arm & Hammer. "A few years ago," he said, "I offered to buy it so I could say yes. But the owners didn't want to sell."
It was announced in 1987 that Dr. Hammer was donating a substantial collection of his personal papers, including documents involving Soviet leaders, to the Library of Congress.
He was awarded a Soviet decoration, the Order of Friendship Among Peoples, and others from several other nations.
Dr. Hammer was married three times, the first time in 1927 to a Russian singer, Olga von Root, by whom he had a son, his only child, Julian. The marriage ended in divorce, as did his second marriage, to Angela Carey Zevely in 1934. In 1956, he married Frances Barrett, a painter, of Beverly Hills, Calif. Mrs. Hammer, who often accompanied her husband on international business trips, died in December 1989, from pneumonia, following surgery for a broken hip.
In addition to his son, Julian, he is survived by a grandson, Michael A. Hammer; a granddaughter, Casey Hammer, and two great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
More Declines in Treasury Yields

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Treasury bond yields continued their seemingly inexorable downward march toward 8 percent yesterday, helped by a decline in oil prices and a softening in a key short-term interest rate.
"There is a very firm tone to the bond market, even though at this point it is overbought," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "It just doesn't give up." 
 By late yesterday, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 107 5/8, up 22/32, to yield 8.06 percent, down from 8.12 percent late Monday. That is the benchmark issue's lowest yield since early January.
Although the drop in oil prices helped, a number of traders said market participants seemed to attach a great deal of significance to a drop in the rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market.
The funds rate slipped below 7 percent for a period yesterday, well under the 7.25 percent level that is seen as the Federal Reserve Board's target for the rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans. On Friday, the central bank indicated that it had lowered the closely watched rate to 7.25 that day.
 
Excess of Reserves
 Analysts said that because of technical factors, the banking system had an excess of reserves, and that this, rather than a change in Fed policy, had caused the drop in the funds rate.
Indeed, the Fed indicated to market participants yesterday that it was not moving the funds rate lower when it entered the Treasury securities market near midday to drain reserves from the banking system. At that time, the funds rate was at 7 percent.
"There is a lot of technical noise in the funds market right now," said James Fralick, a principal and senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "I don't think the Fed chose this time to signify an easing move."
In Mr. Fralick's view, the Fed is more likely to approve another quarter-point cut in the funds rate when members of its policy-making Open Market Committee meet in Washington next week.
"The Fed's draining operation was clearly a rate protest move," one government-bond trader said. "But the fact that funds didn't go back up to 7.25 percent after they came in helped the market later in the day."
By late in the day the funds rate was trading at around 7 1/16 percent.
 
Lending Shown to Slow
 Credit market participants may also have been encouraged by a report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that showed bank lending continued to contract in the third quarter.
According to the F.D.I.C. report, net loans and leases at all commercial banks rose by 4.1 percent in the 12 months ended Oct. 31, down from a 4.4 percent increase in the period covering the second quarter of 1989 to the second quarter of 1990. Bank lending had increased at a 6 percent rate for each of the previous three years.
"Bank-loan growth will probably remain weak in 1991, and continued tight credit conditions could significantly limit economic growth," analysts at MMS International, an economic information service, noted in their daily market commentary.
Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at the Bank of America, said that "if only monetary policy is going to be used to bring us out of recession, interest rates are going to need to fall a lot more before a lot of outstanding debt gets refinanced" and banks start lending again.
 
Note Prices Rise
 Treasury bond prices were not the only beneficiaries of the day's events. In the secondary market for Treasury notes, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at a price of 104 in late trading, up 11/32, to yield 7.9 percent. And the 7 3/8 percent two-year notes rose by 2/32, to a late price of 100 1/4, to yield 7.23 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates also fell. By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.81 percent, down four basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bills were offered at a late rate of 6.7 percent, down one basis point.
During the afternoon, the Treasury said that after its Dec. 19 auction it would discontinue its offerings of four-year notes. Instead, it will offer five-year notes on a monthly basis. These securities are currently sold on a quarterly basis.
The moves "will produce a much more rational pattern of debt service payments each quarter," said Louis v. B. Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, an economic consulting firm. "From a debt management perspective, this step is long overdue."
 
Active Corporate Market
 In other developments, the continued slide in interest rates produced another huge spurt of activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market, as eight companies offered a total of $1.54 billion worth of new securiites.
Among the issuers was the Province of Saskatchewan, which sold $300 million worth of 30-year debentures through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
The 9 3/8 percent securities, which mature Dec. 15, 2020, were priced at $99.33 to yield 9.443 percent, 1.36 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The Ford Motor Credit Corporation offered $200 million of seven-year notes through an underwriting group led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The 9 3/8 percent notes were priced at $99.686, to yield 9.437 percent, 1.56 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent seven-year notes.
The issue is rated AA-3 by Moody's and AA- by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of widely quoted issues rose by about 1/8 of a point.

HEADLINE: New Occidental Chief Expected to Shift Focus

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 11

 BODY:
In the 33 years he headed the company, Armand Hammer shaped the Occidental Petroleum Corporation in his own image, pushing the company into diverse interests, giving it a worldwide reach and making its course difficult to predict.
With Dr. Hammer's death on Monday night at the age of 92, Occidental, the nation's 16th-largest industrial company, now faces a period of reassessment. Analysts expect Ray R. Irani, who has succeeded Dr. Hammer as chairman and chief executive officer, to try to focus Occidental more closely on its core oil and chemical businesses and to reduce the company's debt load, possibly by selling some divisions. 
 Analysts and investors speculated that Mr. Irani might sell the company's 51 percent interest in IBP Inc., a meatpacking concern, for as much as $1 billion. The company's coal operations and its natural gas transmission business are also considered candidates for sale.
 
Dividend Cut Called Possible
 Analysts said Mr. Irani might also cut the company's dividend, although he has previously said that he would not favor such a move.
Reflecting a belief that any changes would benefit the company's flagging stock price, shares of both Occidental and IBP rose in heavy trading after the news of Dr. Hammer's death. [Obituary, page D20.]
Occidental's shares rose $1.875 on the New York Stock Exchange today, to $22.625. The issue was the most active of the day, with 8.1 million shares changing hands. Occidental shares have long been considered a laggard on Wall Street, and despite a general rise in oil stocks the stock had fallen from $30 earlier this year.
IBP's stock rose $2.625 to close at $19 a share.
"Ray Irani is not likely to be a whole lot different from Armand Hammer in his approach to the company," said Peter Hunsberger, an analyst with John S. Herold Inc., a petroleum research firm in Greenwich, Conn. "Yet it is new blood and he may be more interested in some of the restructuring ideas that Armand Hammer was not very interested in."
Mr. Irani said through a spokesman today that it "is not an appropriate time to discuss corporate matters." But analysts said they thought he would be inclined to turn Occidental, which last year had revenues of $20.1 billion and a net income of $285 million, into a smaller but more profitable company.
"Under Armand Hammer the company just grew and grew and the stock has gone nowhere," said Warren Shimmerlik, an independent oil analyst in New York. "Irani has the opportunity to change the company, make it smaller instead of larger, to get the debt down and free up cash flow so more funds can be invested internally to increase their returns."
 
Reluctant to Cede Authority
 Like many strong-willed executives, Dr. Hammer long seemed reluctant to cede any authority over what he regarded as his company (he owned well under 1 percent of Occidental's shares). He went through a series of top executives during the 1970's and early 80's, many of whom left in frustration. But Mr. Irani, a 55-year-old chemist who had been president of the Olin Corporation, served faithfully and apparently amicably under Dr. Hammer as president beginning in 1984. After Dr. Hammer temporarily fell ill earlier this year, Dr. Hammer publicly stated that Mr. Irani would succeed him should he retire or die.
Mr. Irani has been running the company on a day-to-day basis in recent years. Dr. Hammer spent considerable time in recent years on the building of the Armand Hammer Museum of Art adjacent to the company's headquarters here. Dr. Hammer spent at least $50 million of Occidental's money on the museum, which opened last month.
Dr. Hammer was also increasingly active in financing efforts to find a cure for cancer, and until the final months of his life he continued to fly around the world arranging oil deals and meeting foreign leaders.
 
'Left in Very Strong Hands'
 "The company is left in very strong hands with Irani and his team," said Eugene L. Nowak, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds.
Mr. Irani's major role has been to guide the company's expansion in the chemicals business. Chemicals, a notoriously cyclical industry, last year accounted for more than a quarter of the company's sales and the vast majority of its operating profit. This year, a slowing economy and higher oil prices have pushed earnings from the chemicals segments down sharply. Analysts said earnings from chemicals could remain depressed for another year but should eventually rebound.
The downturn in chemicals this year has been largely offset by an improvement in the company's oil and gas segment. Occidental explores for oil and owns and operates fields around the world. The sharp increase in oil prices following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait helped push oil and gas earnings up fivefold in the third quarter as earnings from chemicals fell sharply.
 
Oil Outlook Viewed as Good
 While the company's earnings from oil will depend to a large extent on oil prices, analysts say the outlook is good. The company should get a boost next year from the completion of work to rebuild the Piper Alpha oil rig in the North Sea, which was severely damaged by a fire in 1988. Occidental has a 36.5 percent interest in the Piper oilfield.
Mr. Nowak said he was projecting earnings for the entire company next year of $1.30 to $1.40 a share, up modestly from the $1.20 he is projecting this year.
The company's coal and natural gas transmission businesses have been lackluster performers. And Occidental has previously indicated that it might be willing to sell its stake in IBP, though it has recently suggested it might want to wait a year or two until it begins seeing the results of an expansion plan at the meatpacker.
 
Valued at $30 to $40 a Share
 Analysts said Occidental's assets, if sold separately, should be worth between $30 and $40 a share. John S. Herold Inc., the research firm, estimated the company's asset value at $33 a share after accounting for the company's $10 billion in debt.
Of the businesses that analysts say are most likely to be sold, Herold said the company's gas transmission segment could be worth $2.25 billion and the stake in IBP $700 million. Many analysts say the IBP stake could be worth $1 billion if a sale includes the assumption of IBP debt.

HEADLINE: SOVIETS ARE URGED TO CHANGE FASTER

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
With the Bush Administration on the verge of giving emergency economic aid to the Soviet Union, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d prodded Moscow today to use this assistance to speed up economic changes, not as a cushion to avoid them.
Mr. Baker and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, conducted a joint news conference at the Houstonian Hotel, where they have been holding two days of talks on a variety of issues, from arms control to the Persian Gulf. 
 Administration officials said it was highly likely that President Bush would announce on Wednesday that he is waiving the Jackson-Vanik trade restrictions, so that the Soviets will be free to buy American food on easy credit from the Commodity Credit Corporation. It is also likely that Mr. Bush will announce a provision of emergency medical assistance to the Soviets, after he meets at the White House on Wednesday with Mr. Shevardnadze, officials said.
On Monday, Mr. Shevardnadze made a public appeal for food and other economic assistance from Washington, and while Mr. Baker confirmed that this would be forthcoming, he added that he and the Soviet foreign minister discussed the importance of "blending" any short-term emergency assistance "with efforts to promote medium or long-term economic reform in the Soviet Union."
 
'A Vibrant Economy'
 With Mr. Shevardnadze sitting next to him, Mr. Baker added that while he did not want to "minimize the current possible short-term needs of the Soviet Union, it is a country with tremendous resource potential and capabilities, and the right market reform can tap this potential in a manner to give that country a vibrant economy."
Mr. Baker said he and Mr. Shevardnadze were in full agreement that any American emergency aid "should be transitional" -- meaning, he indicated, that it should be a bridge to a free-market Soviet economy not a crutch for maintaining the current half-way economic liberalization.
On regional issues, Mr. Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze announced that in order to help promote a settlement of the Angolan civil war, Mr. Shevardnadze would meet on Wednesday in Washington, for the first time, with Jonas Savimbi, head of Unita, an American-backed guerrilla organization that has been fighting to topple the pro-Soviet Angolan government.
Mr. Baker, for his part, will be meeting with Pedro Van Dunem, the Angolan foreign minister.
 
Outline of Angola Accord
 Mr. Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze said in a joint statement that they would "outline their concept of a settlement, including a cease-fire agreement; free participation of Unita and other parties in the political process in Angola in the framework of multiparty democracy; the conduct of free and fair elections and the termination of deliveries of all lethal materials to Angola" once there is a cease-fire.
The two ministers said they made progress on resolving the myriad technical issues still holding up a treaty limiting strategic nuclear weapons, but had more work to do. They were also having to spend a great deal of time haggling over loose ends from the conventional arms reduction treaty they signed in Paris last month, officials said.
Because the Soviets withdrew so many tanks and artillery pieces from Europe before the conventional arms treaty went into effect, they will not be destroying as much armor as originally projected. Some leading Senators have warned the Administration that unless they can get some ironclad assurances from Moscow about how these thousands of tanks and artillery pieces, now behind the Ural Mountains, will be, in effect, neutralized, if they are not going to be destroyed, the Senate is not likely to ratify the treaty.
 
U.S. on Gulf Position Backed
 On the Persian Gulf, Mr. Shevardnadze endorsed the American position that Iraq should agree to receive Mr. Baker in Baghdad at an early date, as the Americans have been demanding, as opposed to the Jan. 12 date offered by the Iraqis, which is only three days before the expiration of the United Nations Security Council deadline for Iraqi troops to be out of Kuwait.
"It is very important that the goodwill grace period that expires on Jan. 14 is taken up with very active diplomatic and political efforts," said Mr. Shevardnadze. "The sooner contacts begin between the Iraqi leadership and the United States, the better it would be."

HEADLINE: Many Incorrect Charges Found On Adjustable-Rate Mortgages

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
As many as one of every four Americans who bought homes with adjustable-rate mortgages may be paying either too much or too little each month because of bank errors in calculating interest rates, according to a report by the General Acounting Office.
The miscalculations were discovered in routine audits of mortgages issued by failed savings and loan associations that have been taken over by Federal regulators. But bankers concede that some adjustable loans, which have complex terms, are also being incorrectly adjusted by solvent institutions.
 
Overcharges Put at $8 Billion
 The extent of the problem is disputed. John Geddes, a former Federal mortgage banking auditor who has been the chief whistle-blower on the errors, estimates that 30 to 35 percent of the country's 12 million outstanding adjustable-rate mortgages, which include home equity loans, are billed incorrectly, with half the borrowers charged too much and the rest too little. 
 He says the net overcharges are about $8 billion, but says he has not estimated the undercharges. It is also unknown how many of these loans have already been paid off. Mr. Geddes's estimate is based on his review of 7,000 adjustable mortgages taken over by the Government in the savings bailout.
Experts cited in an October report of the accounting office, the investigative arm of Congress, put the error rate at 20 to 25 percent of these mortgages, but some banking industry officials contend that the rate is considerably less than that. Chase, for instance, audited its adjustable mortgages last year and found almost no errors.
The size of the errors varies, with most considered to be small. But Shirley and Gordon Wynn of Miami received a $1,463.99 refund from the Coral Gables Federal Savings and Loan in September after pointing out to the bank that charges on their adjustable home mortgage since 1987 had been based on an interest rate of 10.875 percent instead of the correct rate of 10.375 percent. The Wynns' monthly mortgage payment is now $797.75, instead of $812.34.
It is unclear whether financial institutions are liable for making refunds to overcharged borrowers, although the first lawsuits challenging lenders on the issue are now being brought by borrowers.
But a big concern to members of Congress who are beginning to look into the problem is the additional cost of the Federal savings and loan bailout if such refunds have to be made.
The Federal regulators' role in the problem is also expected to be discussed at Congressional hearings to be held on the miscalculations. Documents from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, which took over thousands of mortgages from failed savings banks whose deposits it insured, show that the corporation knew as early as the summer of 1988 that many mortgages in its portfolio were being billed incorrectly.
People working for the agency say they were told not to notify overcharged borrowers, and to keep billing at the wrong interest rates. "I don't believe that most of the errors were intentional," Mr. Geddes said, "but what I did find is that once the errors were found, a lot of savings and loans, and the F.S.L.I.C. for certain, would do nothing to fix them."
Federal regulators overseeing the portfolio would not comment on that practice, arguing that they would first like to finish a formal audit of these mortgages.
The miscalculations came to light in the summer of 1989, when Mr. Geddes alerted Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana to the large percentage of errors in the mortgages taken over by the F.S.L.I.C., where he was employed.
 
Lugar Sought Review
 Late last year, the Senator asked several Government banking agencies to review reports of a growing mortgage bookkeeping problem, and was told there was none.
"They all wrote back, 'We don't see any problems,' " said Steven Fischer, the Senator's aide for banking issues.
Still, after the release of the G.A.O. report, which was requested by Senator Lugar, the F.D.I.C. began an audit of its Chicago office mortgage portfolio, where Mr. Geddes and others who confirm his story worked.
Arthur Lorentzen, an assistant director in the F.D.I.C.'s Division of Liquidation, originally said the review of a sample of the Chicago portfolio would be finished by the second week in December. But on Thursday he said his office would review the audit and postpone an announcement of the results indefinitely.
"Because of the publicity about all this we've decided to go back and refigure them," he said in an interview. "There's a lot more to it than meets the eye," he said of the audit process.
 
Human Mistakes
 In most cases, Mr. Geddes and others familiar with the process said, the errors have resulted from human mistakes at failed savings institutions, many of which were small operations, unfamiliar with the complexity of adjustable-rate mortgages. Often, they computed adjustable mortgages by hand. The G.A.O. report suggest that the problem may be greatest in the Middle West, where banks are smaller and adjustable-rate mortgages are less common than on the coasts.
Unlike fixed-rate mortgages, whose rates are fixed for the duration of the mortgage, adjustable-rate mortgages have interest rates that rise and fall with a designated index of prevailing interest rates. The rates are usually low for the first year, and are then adjusted every six months or every year after that.
The rate consists of an index like the interest rate on Treasury bills plus a fixed margin of two or three percentage points. Changes are usually "capped," and the rate may not rise more than two percentage points in any adjustment period and six percentage points over the life of the loan.
In some cases, the problems are caused by computer glitches, as indicated by an audit of a sample of 96 adjustable-rate mortgages from a failed savings institution, the Victor Federal Savings and Loan of Muskogee, Okla., The audit, conducted for the F.S.L.I.C. by the Bennington Group, a San Diego consulting firm, found that the bank's computer system contained logic errors. The bank, among other things, rounded rates upward instead of downward and "pulled" the index on the wrong date.
Victor ended up undercharging borrowers by $130,000, said Bernard Lomax, an executive at the consulting firm.
 
Poor Record-Keeping
 Mr. Geddes and other former F.S.L.I.C. workers say errors also resulted from the poor recordkeeping at failed savings and loans. Federal bank receivers had unusual or hard-to-locate interest indexes, or were missing documentation, or did not match the agency's computer programs.
Some mortgages in the F.S.L.I.C portfolio, have never been adjusted, according to Betty Skatchke, a former loan officer who was in charge of adjustable loans and the corporation's Chicago office. For mortgages taken out in a time of rising interest rates, this would result in serious undercharges.
 
A Subtraction Mistake
 She also recalled a large commercial loan in which a four percentage point interest margin was subtracted instead of added to the index rate, leaving the business paying at an interest rate of a little more than 3 percent instead of more than 10 percent.
"We were told that if there were errors we were not to touch them," Ms. Skatchke said. "The bottom line statement was, 'We must be consistent in our errors.' "
Indeed, agency documents show that the Chicago office of the F.S.L.I.C. sought the first of 13 legal opinions about the Federal Government's potential liability for overcharges by failed banks in August 1988.
 
Checking the Rate
 Homeowners can check their own mortgages by finding the index and the margin for their loans in their loan agreement. The agreement should specify the date on which the mortgage rate changes. The bank bases the new interest rate on the rate at which the index was trading 45 days before that change date. That index rate is published in newspapers. To arrive at the new interest rate, add the margin to the index rate and then check that the mortgage cap was not exceeded.
Mortgage consulting services will also provide audits, for a $40 or $50 fee, for consumers who want to check whether lenders are charging them correctly. These firms also sell mortgage-checking kits for $3 to $15 that contain tables on interest rates over several years and on several indexes.
Mr. Lorentzen said the F.D.I.C. would probably credit any overcharges it finds to the borrower's principal balance. Some interpretations of the Federal Truth in Lending Act maintain that the borrower may be entitled to cash, but the G.A.O. report noted that the issue probably would be left to the courts to decide.
 
Delays Cited
 Still, some mortgage holders have found the Government unresponsive to their requests for refunds or their inquiries. Evelyn McGuire, a Paducah, Ky., apartment landlord and real estate agent, is still waiting for Federal regulators to untangle three adjustable-rate mortgages they took over from the First Federal Savings and Loan of Paducah, which failed in 1988.
The $120,000 mortgages started out in 1986 with identical payments and balances, Mrs. McGuire said, but they have since wandered off in different directions. Now, she is waiting for the F.D.I.C. to explain why she has three different monthly payments, three different loan balances and two different payment schedules. On top of that, Mrs. McGuire added, the F.D.I.C. got the index wrong at the change date last September.
"I'm in the real estate business and I know how to check the numbers," Mrs. McGuire said in an interview. "So I wrote and asked them to document how they got that number, but they have never answered, they do not return my phone calls. So I pay it every month, but I tell them I'm paying under protest."
And not all homeowners received refunds from their banks as easily as the Wynns. Class action suits charging violations of the Truth in Lending Act, enacted to protect borrowers against such things as interest-rate fluctuations, were brought in September against four small Indiana savings and loans, with Mr. Geddes acting as a researcher for Henry Price, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs. Mr. Price, of Indianapolis, is seeking refunds of the overcharges plus undetermined damages under the Federal law.
It is unclear how the courts would treat any of these cases. The G.A.O. report cites the opinion of Federal regulators that the Truth in Lending Law "probably does not" require lenders to repay overcharges in any form, but legal opinions sought by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation held the opposite view. Borrowers who were undercharged, however, are not believed to be liable for making up the difference.

HEADLINE: Florio Plans Wide Improvements for Newark Airport Area

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
The Florio administration has developed plans for more than $1.7 billion in construction projects in and around Newark Airport, including miles of new construction along the New Jersey Turnpike and a rail connection between the city of Newark and the airport.
Officials say the plans are intended to take advantage of growth at Newark Airport to generate thousands of publicly financed construction jobs at a time of recession, and permanent jobs to help bring the unemployed of the inner cites into the workforce. 
 But to pay for the project his aides and appointees have designed, Gov. Jim Florio will have to approve toll increases on the New Jersey Turnpike and Hudson River crossings. In a season of anti-tax fervor in New Jersey, Mr. Florio is relying on the authorities to make the case for toll increases before he supports them.
 
Parts of the Strategy
 Among the major pieces of the administration strategy for the Newark Airport area are these:
*More than $635 million in new construction along the New Jersey Turnpike, including adding a new lane in both directions from exits 11 to 14, improvements of the "southern mixing bowl" between exits 14 and 15E, and improved access to the the airport at exit 13A.
*More than $900 million in improvements by the Port Authority to the airport and the ports of Newark and Elizabeth, including a new $378 million "people mover" to transport air passengers from parking lots to terminals.
*A train link between the airport and the city; the plan favored by many officials in Trenton and supported this week by Mayor Sharpe James, would use $60 million in Port Authority funds to build a new station alongthe Northeast corridor tracks next to the airport, and use Amtrak or New Jersey Transit trains to connect the airport to Newark and New York City.
*More than $187 million in State Department of Transporation improvements to routes leading to the city, the airport and the port, including routes 1, 9, 21 and Doremus Avenue.
In an announcement scheduled for Wednesday, the Transportation Commissioner, Thomas Downs, is expected to disclose the recommendations of the Governor's Transportation Executive Council for the northeast section of the state, including much of the plans for the Newark Airport area.
The council, which includes representatives of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and a variety of state agencies, has directed that spending by the Turnpike Authority, which has $1.3 billion in its coffers, be coordinated with construction plans of the Port Authority in the airport area. The State Department of Transportation plans to draw money from its transporation trust fund to pay for the Newark area improvements.
Ever since taking office last January, Mr. Florio has tried to gain control over the spending by the independent authorities, and to use their expenditures to pay for construction projects and transportation goals that the financially strapped state agencies cannot afford.
The Newark plan shifts the focus of development in northern New Jersey from the Hudson Waterfront, the priority under Gov. Thomas H. Kean, to creating jobs south of Newark, one of the state's poorest areas.
Carl Van Horn, a top policy adviser to the Governor, said the decision to concentrate much of the available state and authority funds in the Newark Airport area grew out of projections by the Port Authority that Newark Airport will grow to rival Kennedy International Airport in the number of passengers it handles by the year 2000.
 
'Gateway of Trade With Europe'
 In addition, Mr. Van Horn said, the proximity of the ports of Elizabeth and Newark, highway and train lines, and the available workers in Newark and other poor cities, make it possible for the area to benefit dramatically from expected increases in trade from Europe through the 1990's.
"The major goal is to establish the port, the airport and the city as a major gateway of trade with Europe," said Carl Van Horn, a top aide to the governor on transportation issues. "These plans could provide job opportunities to a part of the state that has suffered greatly over the past decade."
But the plans confront the Governor with a political problem. The turnpike funds would come from money raised in a 1985 $2 billion bond issue, $1.3 billion of which has gone unspent. To pay for the bonds, the turnpike leadership has told Trenton, will require a toll increase that would likely exceed 60 percent.
In addition, the Port Authority, whose new chairman, Richard Leone, was apppointed by Mr. Florio, has asked for $1 increases in tolls at Hudson river crossings as well as 25 cent increases in PATH fares. Increases in Port Authority tolls require the approval of both the governors of New York and New Jersey. Unless the authority is granted the increases, the authority has said, its plans for improvements to the Newark Airport and Port would be severely curtailed.
 
Wrath From Motorists
 Aides say Mr. Florio heavily favors the construction projects, but they point out that after a year in which the Governor suffered mightily for raising taxes, the last thing he needs is more wrath from motorists.
Before Mr. Florio decides to approve the toll increases, politicians here say, he will wait to see what reaction the authorities draw from the public in New Jersey for their proposals.
Although the Port Authority's plans for the airport and port were announced several weeks ago, the turnpike has yet to announce what it plans to do with the unspent $1.3 billion of its 1985 bond issue. According to one official, even if the Turnpike Authority would return the entire $1.3 billion to the bond market, it would ask the Governor to approve a toll increase of more than 25 percent.
If a toll increase were approved, the authority estimates that construction could begin on the turnpike widening sometime next spring.
 
'1950's Liberal Logic'
 As for the rail link between the city of Newark and the airport, officials say there is a growing consensus among agencies and city officials that the most practical of several proposals would be the use of existing rail lines and the construction of a new station next to Conrail's abandoned 97-acre Waverly Yard.
One critic of the Florio administration, George Sternlieb, an economist and retired professor at Rutgers University, said the ideas of shifting the limited public money into the Newark area and raising tolls were ill-conceived.
"This has a certain amount of 1950's liberal logic to it, but it flies in the face of the market," Mr. Sternlieb said. "Its the same old rhetoric: let's pump money into the older central cities, lets breathe life, if not into corpses, into lifeless areas."
"The real issue is that you have a very frail economy," Mr. Sternlieb said of the proposed toll increases. "Do you really want to add more of a tax burden now?"

HEADLINE: Wary G.O.P. Governors Discuss Taxes

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PINEHURST, N.C., Dec. 11

 BODY:
Republican governors ended a two-day meeting here today, still bruised from party setbacks in the elections and saying the party had to address core economic and tax issues to avoid bigger problems in 1992.
"We dodged a bullet last month," said Richard Wirthlin, a Republican poll taker, "and in 1992 the issues you will all face are budgeting and taxes. That's clear, and there is nowhere for any of you to hide." 
 Mr. Wirthlin and others noted that, as midterm elections go, the party had not done as badly as it had in other elections over the last 20 years when there were Republicans in the White House.
Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri, the departing chairman of the Republican Governors' Association, said the net loss of one governorship, eight House seats and one Senate seat made it basically "a break-even year," particularly since greater losses had been predicted.
 
Arizona Still Undecided
 The lineup of governors in 1991 will be 28 Democrats, 19 Republicans and 2 independents, both of whom are former Republicans. The race for governor in Arizona is to be decided in a January runoff.
But even as Governor Ashcroft and others tried to wring an upbeat message from the elections, some here were not so sanguine. Publicly and privately, they wrestled with the messages and strategies the party should use to avoid more defeats.
Gov. Michael Castle of Delaware said that in the midterm elections the party had failed in its mission to blame the Democratic-controlled Congress for the budget and tax debacles. What was needed, he said, was the outspokenness, combativeness and energy of the next party chairman, William J. Bennett.
"He makes an impact and he can crystallize issues," Governor Castle said after Mr. Bennett appeared before the group.
 
Differing on a Debate
 Some called for a bracing debate between the party's conservative and pragmatic wings, but others disagreed with such a strategy.
"Those kinds of debates are irrelevant to the whole world," said Governor-elect James Edgar of Illinois. "I'm more concerned with keeping our budget in balance and managing our fiscal problems than I am about any new paradigm."
But Mr. Bennett, speaking with reporters after addressing the group of 16 Republican governors and governors-elect, said he thought debate was good. "Debate is what you have in a brain-live party," he said.
In his speech to the group, Mr. Bennett urged the governors to devise ways of addressing the country's "most vexing problem, the position of the poor."
"Let's stop talking past one another," he said, "and let's set up a way to provide for a rigorous analysis of what works and what doesn't work in providing the conditions for upward mobility for the poor."
 
Meetings With Quayle
 On the troubling issues of taxes and budgets, the governors sought to send a message to President Bush in meetings with Vice President Dan Quayle, who addressed the group.
Gov. Carroll Campbell of South Carolina, who will become the chairman of the group for the coming year, would not say what the governors said to Mr. Quayle, but he did offer his own advice on the position the party ought to take on taxes. In an implicit criticism of the Bush Administration, he said the party should not build a tax policy around the capital gains tax and little else, nor make hard-and-fast statements against tax increases.
"I don't make Sherman-esque statements and say I will never do this or never do that," said Governor Campbell. "I may have to do just that for the good of my state later."
Mr. Quayle, meeting with reporters early today after his meetings with the governors, said he did not see future tax debates revolving solely around the capital gains tax.
"It will be more inclusive," he said. "We have learned some political lessons about how to handle the capital gains tax. Any growth package in the future would be more inclusive."
 
Linking Taxes and Services
 Mr. Wirthlin and Robert M. Teeter, President Bush's poll taker, appeared to echo Governor Campbell on the other taxation issue when they told the governors to talk to voters about providing better services for the taxes paid.
"It's true, nobody likes tax increases," said Mr. Wirthlin, "but people want value for their tax dollar. You have to do things to highlight that you are giving them value for every tax dollar you collect."
He said that if the Republican Party found that it had to advocate tax increases the governors and the party should look carefully at what taxes can get voter support and which cannot. He said that recent polling had shown that many voters with low incomes would prefer an increase in the sales tax to one in the income tax, if some higher tax was unavoidable.
"They are cynical and don't believe that the upper income brackets actually end up paying their share of income tax increases," said Mr. Wirthlin. "So if you have to, look at all kinds of taxes."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Plans More Job Cuts For This Year

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Taking a stern fiscal stance on the eve of a major sale of New York City bonds, the Dinkins administration said yesterday that the city would have to cut another 7,000 to 10,000 jobs -- about half of them through layoffs -- to help close a $250 million budget gap in the current fiscal year.
City officials said the job reductions were necessary because of expected cuts in state aid and projected shortfalls in tax revenue that have thrown the budget out of balance again, just weeks after Mayor David N. Dinkins announced that the city would not be able to fill 5,000 jobs and would lay off at least 556 workers. 
 Altogether, officials said, perhaps 15,000 jobs would be cut by the end of the fiscal year, June 30, and another 5,000 in the following year, when the city faces a projected gap of at least $1.3 billion between revenues and spending.
 
Quicker Timetable
 City officials had earlier said that they envisioned cutting as many as 20,000 jobs over the next 18 months, and they said yesterday's announcement amounted to accelerating that pace to save more money now.
Barry L. Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which is negotiating a new contract with the city, said the administration had made the announcement now to appease the Wall Street credit-rating agencies. The agencies have been reviewing the city's ratings in anticipation of its plan to borrow money through the sale of $1.2 billion in bonds today. If the ratings are lowered -- indicating that Wall Street considers the city's bonds to be a riskier investment -- the city ends up paying higher interest on money it borrows.
"The Mayor has spent a good deal of time with the rating agencies and this is a way of placating the financial community's avarice," Mr. Feinstein said. He said Mr. Dinkins had been overly gloomy about layoff projections in the past and was wrong now, too. "The Mayor has a thing about self-immolation," he said.
But Budget Director Philip R. Michael said the latest orders to cut, given to city agencies yesterday morning, had been made in recognition of the city's changing fiscal condition. "There comes a time when you've got to pin down these things," he said. "If we weren't selling bonds this week, might this have happened a week later? That's certainly possible."
Told that labor leaders had complained that they had not been consulted about the moves, Mr. Michael said, "What else is new?"
Mr. Michael said he believed the rating agencies "were very interested in expense reductions" by the city.
An official at one rating service, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "It doesn't take a rocket scientist" to see that additional layoffs are a likely option.
Mr. Michael outlined the plans to reporters after one credit rating agency, Standard & Poor's, affirmed its A- rating on the city's bonds, while keeping them on the "negative credit watch" it imposed in October.
 
Plans for Deeper Cuts
 A second rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, was still reviewing its rating, and met with Mayor Dinkins, Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman and other senior officials at City Hall yesterday afternoon for a final review, in which city officials argued for mantaining the agency's A rating. Moody's is expected to make a statement today.
In recent months, in recognition of New York City's troubled economy and fiscal condition, city bonds have already been trading below their stated ratings.
In a reflection of the persistence of the fiscal problems, Mr. Michael said most agencies had been told to outline cuts amounting to 17.5 percent of their budgets in the coming fiscal year. Earlier, they had been told to prepare cuts of 10 percent and contingency plans to cut 7.5 percent more if conditions worsened.
Of those reductions, Mr. Michael said, Mr. Dinkins had ordered that cuts of 10 percent should be achieved by reducing spending for wages and benefits, to spur agencies to shrink the city work force.
 
Cuts in Education
 Mr. Michael did not say precisely where layoffs could come, but said they would be spread among agencies. The expected state cuts in aid to education could force the Board of Education to lay off "more than a couple of thousand" workers.
In its statement affirming its current rating, Standard and Poor's said it "expects the city to take all necessary actions to achieve fiscal balance." But it added that "in light of the contracting economy, that challenge will be more difficult to meet than in prior years."
It said that maintaining the current rating "depends upon formulation of a plan that reflects the uncertainty of the economic environment and balances achievable revenue assumptions with necessary service reductions."

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
500 GULF HOSTAGES FLOWN TO SAFETY

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Nearly 500 Western and Japanese hostages left Kuwait and Iraq today on chartered planes, but only one American emerged from hiding in Kuwait to board one of the three Boeing 707's sent there for what had been described as a final evacuation effort.
Two chartered British planes picked up 240 British and other Western nationals in Kuwait, along with the single American, who declined to identify himself. The evacuees were joined in Baghdad by 72 Britons who had been returned in recent days by Iraqi authorities from military and industrial installations where they were held as so-called human shields. 
 Another 8 Americans, gathered from strategic sites in Iraq, boarded the American evacuation flight to Frankfurt tonight. Seven Americans were on a British charter from Kuwait to London, and 6 got themselves out by driving in cars to Saudi Arabia from Kuwait.
[Both flights landed at their destinations on Tuesday evening, The Associated Press reported.]
The State Department in Washington said as many as 309 Americans had chosen to stay in Kuwait and 200 in Iraq. These included 294 children, 100 women and 115 men with dual citizenship. Another 30 are unaccounted for.
State Department officials say they believe that 268 Americans have left Iraq and Kuwait since the latest hostage exodus began over the weekend.
Originally, the State Department said there were about 750 Americans who were believed to be in Kuwait and Iraq. But now the estimate is that there may have been 807 Americans in the two countries.
 
No More Held as Shields
 A United States Embassy official here said she was satisifed that no more Americans were being held at Iraqi installations.
Separately, 159 Japanese hostages boarded an Iraqi Airways charter to Bangkok. Fourteen of them had been diplomats in Kuwait.
Despite the poor turnout for the American charter flight to Kuwait, which returned to Baghdad carrying one Irishman and two Canadians, United States officials here and in Washington said a final charter flight has been scheduled for Thursday.
"We don't know many people are in deep hiding," said Jeanette Pinot, a United States consular officer who was ushering Americans onto the plane at Saddam International Airport. "But I think it's going to be a trickle from now on." A State Department doctor who arrived today from Cairo accompanied the Americans to Frankfurt.
 
'Continue to Assist'
 The deputy chief of the American Embassy in Baghdad, Joseph C. Wilson 4th, added, "We will not get big planeloads, I don't believe, but we will continue to assist any American held against their will."
Mr. Wilson, who has supervised the consular effort that has assisted more than 2,500 Americans trapped in Kuwait since the invasion by Iraq on Aug. 2, said the flights this week will conclude a complex and successful evacuation effort.
After he moved through the line of hostages shaking hands and saying goodbye to some of those who have lived for months in safe haven here at the residence of the United States Ambassador, April Glaspie, Mr. Wilson told reporters, "I swear to God that I hope this is the last time in my generation and my childrens' generation that we ever face the specter of people being taken against their will."
At the American Embassy in Kuwait, Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howell; his deputy, Barbara Bodine, and two other diplomats remained behind after the departure of 6 of their colleagues and about 12 other Americans who had taken refuge there.
 
Christmas Carols at Embassy
 An Irishman who was in hiding within sight of the embassy compound in Kuwait said Mr. Howell and his group of holdouts played Christmas carols over loudspeakers two nights ago as Iraqi soldiers maintained their cordon around the United States mission, which is still without electricity and basic services.
Iraqi military authorities have told the last of the diplomats that anyone who steps outside of the compound will not be able to return. United States officials say the status of the embassy after it is abandoned, which is scheduled to happen on Thursday, will be that it is "open" but not staffed, "whatever that means," a Western official here said.
Although it is hard to come up with exact figures in the turmoil associated with the hasty exodus, State Department officials said that they believed 268 Americans had left so far. These included those who departed today and on Sunday, plus those who departed with John Connally, the former United States Treasury Secretary, on Saturday.
In Washington, the State Department said that the 30 Americans who remain unaccounted for may include some who are still in "deep hiding," and still others who may possess false identity papers protecting economic assets, businesses and property in Kuwait.
 
Missing Americans Sought
 The Voice of America was reported on Monday to be broadcasting appeals for information from four Americans who have not been heard from since August, a United States official here said.
A number of hostages speculated that some Americans and other Westerners still are missing, and some may have perished during any of the hundreds of sometimes harrowing and desperate attempts to escape through the Kuwaiti desert toSaudi Arabia.
The combination of intense August heat and random shootings by Iraqi soldiers may also have claimed lives, the returning hostages said.
Of those Americans who remained, a State Department official said: "It's people where the family chooses to stay -- a Kuwaiti husband has an American wife, or Kuwaiti husband and wife have an American kid. They'd have to break up the family to go. Some are Arab-Americans, some are dual nationals -- people whose homes, family ties and maybe business interests are there and who consider themselves more Iraqi than American.
"We've got these people everywhere," he added. "Beirut, Monrovia, everywhere."
 
Briton Posed as Romanian
 Several British hostages arrived from Kuwait saying they passed themselves off as citizens of such countries as Romania and Spain.
Leonard and Maureen Baker of Southampton, England, said they stayed in their home near Schuwaikh Port in Kuwait and fended off inquiring Iraqis with Romanian identity documents. They said they witnessed the "commercial looting" of the city and its port by the Iraqi Army, which used "thousands of trucks from Baghdad."
Mr. Baker said he saw goal posts disappear from the soccer fields and cranes used to hoist heavy equipment, construction huts, cars and the inventory of port warehouses onto 16-wheel trucks for transport to Iraq.
Mr. Baker, a service engineer for Volvo Penta, said that in Kuwait's marinas thousands of yachts, fishing boats and pleasure craft were burned or sunk by the Iraqi military to prevent flight by sea. The Bakers lost their 26-foot boat.
One of the last Americans to board today's flight, Mike Nickerman of Grand Island, Neb., spent four months in idle but safe haven at the residence of Miss Glaspie, the American Ambassador to Iraq, who was out of the country at the time of the invasion.
Mr. Nickerman, who had been working on a construction site near the Syrian border on Aug. 2, said the lesson he had learned from his experience was never to hesitate in the face of danger. He criticized his own caution and unwillingness to escape Iraq at the outset of the crisis.
"I learned if something looks like trouble, I'm going to get out while I have the chance," Mr. Nickerman said.
 
 
 
MORE IRAQI TROOPS IN KUWAIT
 WASHINGTON, Dec. 11 (AP) -- Iraq has placed 20,000 more troops in and around Kuwait in the past week, expanding the Iraqi armed force in the area to more than half a million soldiers, Pentagon officials said today.
Last week, the Pentagon said Iraq had sent 480,000 troops to Kuwait and southern Iraq. That represented an increase of 30,000 from the week before.
Mr. Williams described the latest additions to the Iraqi force as "a rounding out of existing brigades" committed to the occupation of Kuwait, rather than the arrival of newly activated brigades.
The United States buildup is also continuing. A Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, said today that an additional 10,000 American troops had arrived in the gulf since last week, increasing the total American force there to 260,000.

HEADLINE: Like Growing Number of Companies, I.B.M. Is Building Child-Care Centers

BYLINE: By CAROL LAWSON

 BODY:
Like an increasing number of corporations that are frustrated by the shortage of good child care for their employees, the International Business Machines Corporation has decided to take a more active role and build its own centers.
The company announced yesterday that it would spend $3 million next year to build five child-care centers near its offices and plants around the country to serve 530 preschool children. 
 It said it would spend an additional $500,000 in communities that have large populations of I.B.M. workers to improve existing day-care centers and to recruit and train people who care for children in their homes. The company does not plan to operate the centers; that will be done by companies specializing in child care. Nor will I.B.M. give employees direct financial assistance for child care.
 
'Lousy Choices'
 "Companies are frustrated because employees have lousy choices," said Dana Friedman, co-president of the Families and Work Institute, a nonprofit research organization based in New York that advises companies on child care.
"A number of companies like I.B.M. that said they would not build child-care centers, that they are not in the business of child care, are reconsidering," Dr. Friedman said. "They have milked other options, and now they realize they have to roll up their sleeves and be in it in a bigger way."
Dr. Friedman added that it was highly unusual for a corporation to build five child-care centers. "I don't know of any company that has built more than two or three," she said.
The new projects represent the largest expenditure to date of the $22 million fund that I.B.M. established a year ago to increase the availability of child-care services for its employees. The money, to be distributed over a five years, represents the largest financial commitment by any American corporation for child care.
Since 1984, I.B.M.'s child-care assistance for its 216,000 employees in the United States has consisted of a referral service. But I.B.M. found that that was strained by the limited supply and poor quality of child care in many American communities.
 
'A Long-Term Investment'
 J. T. Childs Jr., the director of the company's Work/Life Program, noted that the number of male employees at I.B.M. had declined by 20 percent over the last 30 years while the number of female employees had tripled, so child care had become a vital program to keep women in the work force.
He described the company's decision as "a long-term investment in our economic and competitive health."
Barbara Reisman, executive director of the Child Care Action Campaign, a national advocacy organization, said the I.B.M. announcement "confirms what we have been saying, that the quality of child care is not what it should be, and that companies can help to do something about it."
But Dr. Edward F. Zigler, a child psychologist and director of Yale University's Bush Center in Child Development and Social Policy, said that while I.B.M. "is to be commended for doing something to make the work place more family friendly," such corporate initiatives "are not the solution" to the lack of adequate child care in the United States.
 
Limited Assistance Now
 Dr. Zigler, a founder of the Head Start program, said, "The Reagan Administration's solution was for the private sector to take this on." But, he said, only 6,000 of nearly six million employers now provide some form of child-care assistance.
"And what will happen when a company falls on hard times?" Dr. Zigler asked. "It will close a child-care center, not an assembly plant."
Mr. Childs said that Work/Family Directions of Boston, I.B.M.'s child-care consultant, would choose experienced child-care companies to operate the centers. "We are not in the child-care business," he said.
Fees at each center will be set by the operator, he said. But since the new centers will not be encumbered by mortgages, he said, "It will be easier for them to operate and establish reasonable fees."
In addition to the new centers, I.B.M. will finance programs to recruit and train people to care for small groups of children in their homes. The company will also provide money to help scores of child-care centers around the country meet the quality standards established by the National Association for the Education of Young Children, the largest group of early-childhood educators in the nation.
Of the $3.5 million, I.B.M. has allocated for construction, nearly half has been designated for two new day-care centers at large office parks in Charlotte and Raleigh, N.C., a state that I.B.M. officials said has an especially severe shortage of good child-care services.
Other new centers are to be built near I.B.M. plants and offices in Rochester, Minn.; Gaithersburg, Md., and Southlake, Tex.
 
'Help the Community'
 Mr. Childs said that although I.B.M. is primarily building child-care centers to help its employees, at least half of the enrollment at most centers will be open to the public. "We are trying to help the community while helping our own people," he said.
Several of I.B.M.'s new centers will be in collaboration with other corporations. For example, in an office park in Charlotte, owned by University Research Park, I.B.M., the American Express Company, Duke Power Company and Research Park will share the costs of building and providing money to start up a $2 million child-care center that will serve nearly 200 children, including mildly sick youngsters. I.B.M. will contribute $500,000 of the total.
In Katonah, N.Y., in Westchester County, near I.B.M.'s headquarters and other offices, the company will be joined by Pepsi-Cola in financing the $600,000 relocation and expansion of a center that provides care for both pre-school and school-age children. I.B.M.'s share will be $430,000.
And in Southlake, Tex., about 20 miles from Dallas, I.B.M. and Maguire Thomas Partners, a real estate developer, will convert an unoccupied building in an office complex into a day-care center for infants and pre-school children. I.B.M. will provide $500,000 of the $800,000 total cost.
Dr. Friedman said I.B.M.'s collaboration with other corporations "could be a catalyst" for other companies to join forces in providing child-care assistance. "Smaller companies can spend less money but still work together and make a dent," she said. "I.B.M. is providing new models, new thinking. It often takes one employer to stand up and say, 'Let's go for it, let's figure out how to do it.' "

HEADLINE: U.S. Treasury Charges Discrimination by Japan

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 11

 BODY:
In a tough new report on the slow opening of Japan's financial markets, the United States Treasury Department said today that foreign banks and securities firms were still blocked from competing on equal terms because of legal and informal hurdles, despite Tokyo's emergence as a major financial center.
The Treasury study conceded that some of the blatant discrimination against foreigners, such as a lack of seats on the Tokyo stock exchange, have been eliminated in recent years. But in a slight shift of focus in Washington's efforts to open Japan's financial markets, it added that some of the worst impediments faced by foreign firms were informal barriers, or unwritten business and government practices. 
 An example of this sort of barrier has cropped up recently in what is becoming one of the most closely watched confrontations between an American securities house and Japanese ways in years.
Salomon Brothers Inc. appeared to have staged a coup recently in breaking the lock grip that big Japanese brokerage houses have on underwriting the yen securities of Japanese companies. It won the mandate to be the lead manager on two big offerings of convertible bonds in the Euromarkets for Oji Paper and Fujisawa Pharmaceutical.
 
'Like Exporting AIDS'
 But just 10 days later, Japan's biggest broker, Nomura Securities, protested vehemently against what it described as the unsound way Salomon planned to trade the bonds after they were issued, a complex technique that is common in the more innovative New York markets. The yen-denominated securities were going to be swapped into dollars, combined with options and sold to American insurance companies as private placements instead of publicly listed securities.
"It's like exporting AIDS from Wall Street," Tadashi Takubo, an executive managing director at Nomura, was quoted as saying in the Japan Economic Journal, the country's leading business newspaper. "We have to protect the soundness of the Tokyo market from the U.S. threat."
Asked about the story, Fujisawa Pharmaceutical said yesterday that it had not decided who would underwrite its convertible bonds and Oji Paper said it would neither confirm nor deny the reports.
But Salomon officials insisted the Big Four securities houses had intimidated the companies into backing away from using an American lead underwriter, in spite of the better terms Salomon was offering.
 
Importance of Cultural Factors
 "We offer good technology and some good market opportunities, but how a Japanese company comes to a decision on its underwriter is the critical question at the end of the day," said Kunihiko Kumagai, a managing director at Salomon Brothers. "The cultural, or invisible factors can be the most important part of doing business."
He added, "We need to learn a lot more about how to persuade a Japanese company."
Earlier this year, Salomon sailed into another controversy when it stunned the Big Four by underwriting some dollar-denominated bonds for Mitsui Toatsu, a big chemical company. Shortly afterward the Japanese newspapers were filled with complaints from the big Japanese brokerage houses on how Salomon's program trading was behind a steep slide in share prices.
The report issued today is a so-called national treatment study, intended to determine whether American financial institutions are permitted to compete on an equal footing with Japan's own banks and securities firms within Japan. The latest report, the fourth in the last decade, repeats the conclusion that Japan still restricts the operating ability of foreign bankers and investment bankers.
According to Treasury estimates, foreign banks have actually been losing ground here.
Foreign banks' share of total lending has tumbled from 3.5 percent in March 1983 to 1.7 percent at the end of last year. By contrast, Japanese banks have taken more than 25 percent of the lucrative California banking market.
No Japanese bank has been acquired by a foreign bank and foreign banks must pay much higher rates to borrow yen and acquire funds to operate in Japan, the report says.
Specifically, the Treasury contends that despite several important openings since 1986, keiretsu, or big groupings of industrial companies and banks, exclude foreign banks. Relatively inexpensive short-term loans from the Bank of Japan are difficult for foreigners to obtain. Japan's short-term money markets remain underdeveloped. And many regulations continue to be delivered orally or in ways that are difficult for foreign banks to obtain and cary out.
On the securities side, the report argues that foreign firms are still excluded from the underwriting business. They are still not free to trade in foreign currencies. New financial products are accepted here only after substantial delays. And foreign firms still face major obstacles in breaking into the lucrative business of managing pension funds and investment trusts.

HEADLINE: Colleges Basing Aid on Race Risk Loss of Federal Funds

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
The Department of Education has decided to begin prohibiting colleges and universities that receive Federal funds from offering scholarships designated for minority students.
Michael L. Williams, the Education Department's Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, said yesterday that "race-exclusive" scholarships, or those based on ethnic origin, were discriminatory and therefore illegal. 
 College administrators and scholarship fund directors reacted with alarm, saying the decision could reverse decades of efforts to increase the enrollment of members of racial and ethnic minorities who have been historically underrepresented in colleges.
"We were shocked by this decision," said Richard F. Rosser, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, which represents 815 institutions. "We have been making enormous efforts to increase the numbers of minority students in our colleges and universities, and this has necessarily required a great deal of financial aid."
Neither Mr. Rosser nor anyone else contacted yesterday could say how many institutions, or what percentage of total financial aid to minority students, might be affected by the new enforcement policy. But the practice of setting aside money to attract qualified minority students and make college more affordable for them has been widespread for at least 20 years.
Scholarships based strictly on financial need often benefit minority students, and they would not be affected. Nor would scholarships awarded to individual students by private foundations and groups. Groups like the United Negro College Fund, which raises money for historically black colleges but does not stipulate that the revenue be used for minority students only, would also seem to be exempt.
Word of the department's policy reached college administrators and scholarship fund directors after the department sent a letter on Dec. 4 to organizers of the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz. The organizers, under fire for the State of Arizona's policy against a holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., had proposed to set up a scholarship fund in Dr. King's memory for the two universities whose teams play in the annual football game. The department's letter cautioned that a scholarship earmarked for minority students would be illegal.
Mr. Williams said his position should not be seen as an assault on minority scholarships or an attempt to curb the numbers of black and Hispanic college students. Rather, he said, he wants his office to have a consistent approach to "race-exclusive" financial aid.
He said the issue was one of seven areas on which the Office of Civil Rights would concentrate as part of a new national enforcement strategy. A memorandum outlining that strategy was circulated in the department yesterday, and will be described at a press conference in Washington today.
It is not clear whether Mr. Williams's initiative has the specific approval of the Bush Administration. Mr. Williams has been preparing the overall enforcement strategy since his appointment in June.
Explaining his position, Mr. Williams said yesterday that institutions receiving money from the Department of Education may not provide or deny financial aid or other benefits on the basis of race, color or national origin. He cited the 1978 Supreme Court decision in Bakke v. University of California at Davis, which held that a state institution could not have fixed quotas for certain racial or ethnic groups, although race could be taken into account in affirmative action programs to remedy past discrimination.
Mr. Williams also cited a 1976 lawsuit, Flanagan v. President and Directors of Georgetown College. In that case, he said, a Federal district court found that the civil rights law had been violated by the college's practice of allocating 60 percent of its financial aid for minority students.
Race-based scholarships may be appropriate within certain narrow limits, Mr. Williams said. For example, exceptions would be allowed at colleges in which past racial or ethnic discrimination had been established. He added that race could be a factor in determining whether a student should receive special financial help, but not the essential factor.
For more than a decade, he said, the Education Department has been inconsistent on the issue of race and financial aid. "We owe colleges and universities a good-faith and legally honest review of the law," he went on. "Quite frankly, we have not done that in the past."
In mid-November, the Fiesta Bowl organizers offered to award $100,000 minority scholarships to each of the two universities fielding football teams in the New Year's Day game, and to name the scholarships in honor of Dr. King. This year's teams are the Universities of Louisville and Alabama.
Last week the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights reviewed the Fiesta Bowl scholarship plan on its own initiative. In the department's Dec. 4 letter, sent by fax to John Junker, the bowl's executive director, Mr. Williams applauded the attempt to provide educational opportunities for minority students. But he added, "You should be aware of certain civil rights obligations," and said colleges failing to comply with provisions of the Civil Rights Act risked losing all Federal revenue.
The letter suggested that the scholarship aid be used to benefit students who are "economically disadvantaged, educationally disadvantaged or from single-parent families."
Brent DeRaad, a Fiesta Bowl spokesman, said bowl officials would follow all Federal regulations. While the fund will be named for Dr. King, he said, the scholarship will not designate race as a criterion for qualification.
"We will let the universities allocate the money as they see fit," Mr. DeRaad said.
Nonetheless, Mr. DeRaad said bowl officials would do all they could to suggest that the scholarships be used for financially needy students.
Richard J. Wood, president of Earlham College in Richmond, Ind., who is co-chairman of the Task Force for Minority Opportunities of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, called Mr. Williams's decision "outrageous," and said it was "the continuation of the kind of thinking" of the Reagan Administration and its Education Secretary, William J. Bennett.

HEADLINE: BUSH BACKS MOVE FOR LIMITING TERMS OF U.S. LAWMAKERS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
President Bush has decided to push for a constitutional amendment to limit the number of terms for members of Congress, his chief of staff, John H. Sununu, said today.
Doing so as he prepares for his re-election campaign will put Mr. Bush squarely and publicly on the side of an idea that is as widely popular among voters as it is wildly unpopular among members of Congress, including many Republican lawmakers. And state lawmakers are not enamored of the idea either. 
 These are the people whose votes would be needed to make the idea a reality. But even though passage of such an amendment is unlikely, there is little risk for Mr. Bush in associating himself with this movement.
 
Evolution of an Issue
 Politically, the move fits nicely with the growing effort by the White House to depict Congress as the source of most of the nation's problems.
"The reality that incumbency breeds a very different attitude is now sensed by the public," Mr. Sununu said.
Mr. Bush has previously said he supports limiting lawmakers' terms, just as the terms of the President and many governors are limited. Vice President Quayle campaigned heavily on the issue during the midterm elections.
But Mr. Sununu's comment today, at a National Press Club luncheon, was the first public indication that the White House plans to work to keep the issue alive -- indeed, draw even more attention to it -- as the Presidential election approaches.
The movement to limit terms, many politicians say, has begun to take on a life of its own, somewhat reminiscent of the way the revolt against taxes gathered momentum a decade ago.
 
Democrats Are Opposed
 Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill are against a constitutional amendment limiting Congressional terms, and have said they would oppose it. Some Democrats have characterized the proposal as a "Republican front," intended to accomplish what the Republicans cannot do at the ballot box: regain control of Congress.
But many incumbent Republicans also oppose the amendment. A spokeswoman for Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the Republican leader of the House, said, "He doesn't think it needs to be done."
President Bush, as Ronald Reagan did before him, has embraced a number of other controversial proposals for constitutional amendments, and none have been enacted. They include measures to curb abortion, to require a balanced budget and to give the President power to veto individual budget items.
Mr. Bush made a public push for an amendment to ban flag burning, which the Supreme Court has ruled is protected by the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. But Democrats, led by Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said such a measure would amount to tampering with the First Amendment, and the measure died on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Sununu made his comment in a luncheon speech in which he also defended himself from the view, prevalent in Washington, that his abrasive style has offended too many people, including Congressional leaders of his own party.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, recently called him the "chief of chaff," and Senator Trent Lott has said he was mystified when Mr. Sununu described the Senator's role in the budget process as "insignficant," even though the Mississippi Republican was involved in the budget negotiations.
 
Another Dig at Congress
 Mr. Sununu took the opportunity today to try to fault Congress for the nation's economic troubles, saying the problems would not be so deep if the Federal budget had been settled six months sooner. Congressional leaders roundly reject blame for the delay.
Mr. Sununu, who as Governor of New Hampshire in 1988 was instrumental in helping Mr. Bush defeat Mr. Dole for the Republcian Presidential nomination, said reports of clashes with members of Congress and others were "based on fiction, not fact." But later he said that his outbursts had been orchestrated to achieve political effect.
"I guarantee you that, contrary to the legend, any strong statements on my part are both controlled, deliberate and designed to achieve an effect," he told the audience. "There is no random outburst. It all is designed for a purpose. And I think the efficiency of the result is underscored by what we've been able to achieve."
 
His Personality an Issue
 The entire day, from the lunchtime speech to an evening show on cable television, seemed to have been an effort by Mr. Sununu to counteract a wave of recent criticism and negative press coverage that painted him as a liability to the President.
Just hours after his appearance at the press club, Mr. Sununu went on Cable News Network, where Larry King, the interviewer, asked Mr. Sununu about his role in the budget negotiations with Congress, his relationships with Republicans with whom he disagrees and the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
Mr. Sununu said, "Oh, not at all," when asked by Mr. King whether President Bush had ever called him on the carpet.
"See," Mr. Sununu said, "I only have a constituency of one to keep happy; that's the President."
 
A Freudian Slip?
 In discussing the issue of limiting terms, Mr. Sununu made a remark at the press club luncheon that was apparently a slip of the tongue. Mr. Sununu said Mr. Bush would "press for a term-limitation amendment that deals with the problems associated with perpetuating the life of those who are elected to govern people."
"I think that's more than a Freudian slip," said Jeff Biggs, chief spokesman for Speaker Foley, who opposes term limits. "That's his true wish."
As the crowd began to laugh at Mr. Sununu's remark, and some people began to applaud, Mr. Sununu corrected himself to say, "The public life of those who are elected to govern people."
In elections this year, voters in California, Oklahoma and Colorado, approved measures limiting the terms of state officeholders -- measures that seemed to give voters a way of expressing their frustration with goverment.
The Colorado measure also seeks to limit the terms of members of Congress, but the constitutionality of state action to limit the tenure of Federal office holders is far from clear.
 
Many Favor 12 Years
 White House officials said Mr. Sununu was not referring to any specific proposal in his speech today. Most proponents of term limits have tended to favor a tenure of 12 years, that is, six terms for members of the House and two terms for senators. But any number of variations are possible, and there would be a number of crucial questions, including how current members would be affected.
The 22d Amendment to the Constitution, limiting the President to two terms, was approved by the 80th Congress in 1947. It won ratification by the required three-fourths of the states in 1951. No amendment has taken longer to ratify.
The 22d Amendment was a reaction, initiated by Republicans, against Franklin D. Roosevelt's decision to break the tradition that a President serve no more than two terms. Roosevelt was elected four times and died in office.
There was an effort to repeal the amendment during Dwight D. Eisenhower's second term, but nothing came of it, and the two-term limit now seems sacrosanct. President Reagan said he opposes both the limit on the President and a limit on lawmakers, but he made no serious effort to repeal the 22d Amendment.
Mr. Foley, who was first elected to the House in 1964, has spoken out repeatedly against the idea of limiting Congressional terms. He, and other opponents, argue that it would deprive voters of the right to choose their own representatives. Most members, they add, serve less than 12 years anyway, and some of the most effective and seasoned legislators would be affected.

HEADLINE: The Budget Cuts: Still Real, Still Right

 BODY:
In October, after months of rancorous debate, Congress passed a budget bill that promised to cut the deficit by nearly $500 billion. Now the Congressional Budget Office reports that, even so, the deficit will rise to record levels this year and next. That has prompted wide cynicism among people who conclude that, once again, Congress must have been trading in mere budget gimmicks. 
 Such cynicism is ill founded. Yes, the level of the deficit will rise beyond previous expectations but for reasons beyond Congress's control -- namely, the skyrocketing costs of the S.& L. bailout and the oncoming recession. But those facts in no way diminish the impact of the budget agreement. Because of the agreement, the deficit will still be $500 billion lower, which is all Congress promised.
In fact, the Congressional Budget Office report can be interpreted as vindicating Congress. Anticipating bad economic news, it purposely held down the first year's cuts for fear of pushing a sluggish economy into recession.
Critics have misinterpreted other parts of the report. Borrowing money to pay off depositors at failed thrifts does not affect capital markets and therefore does not hurt the economy. Cutting programs or raising taxes to pay for the S.& L. bailout is unwarranted.
Nor should Congress react to the rise in deficits caused by recession. Tax revenues will fall; expenditures for unemployment compensation and welfare will rise. These changes are welcome because they will alleviate misery and mitigate the downturn. If Congress tried to keep the deficit steady by further cutting programs or raising taxes, it would worsen the slide. That would drive up unemployment, as well as the deficit. And that's precisely why the budget cuts were "back-loaded," falling more heavily in later years.
The purpose of deficit reduction is to reduce the amount the Government siphons from private borrowers and therefore from capital formation. But that's not an important danger in this climate, when the economy is receding and corporations aren't borrowing. The budget agreement will restrain Federal borrowing best when that restraint is needed most: when the economy returns to capacity. And nothing in the Congressional Budget Office report says otherwise.

HEADLINE: The Daily News Wins Backing In Chicago

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 11

 BODY:
The board of The Daily News's parent, the Tribune Company, met here today, and afterward the publisher of the paper, James Hoge, said The News would continue to publish as long as it showed progress in overcoming the seven-week-old strike by 9 of its 10 unions.
Mr. Hoge cited as progress what he called an increase to a circulation of 580,000. Before the strike began on Oct. 25, The News's circulation was 1.09 million. It has also lost most of its advertising as a result of the strike. 
 The meeting of the Tribune Company's 14-member board at the company's headquarters on Michigan Avenue was closed, but afterward Mr. Hoge told reporters that the board had considered all the options for the future of the paper, including its possible sale or closing.
 
'We Are Making Progress'
 But the only option supported, Mr. Hoge said, was "plowing ahead as long as we can show that we are making progress."
"It is the opinion of everybody involved in this effort that we are making progress," the publisher added.
In a statement issued after the meeting, Mr. Hoge said the board "expressed continued strong support of Daily News management." As the board met in the morning, about 100 pickets, including some Guild members from The News and some union members from Chicago, marched outside the headquarters chanting, "Settle or sell."
Jerry Minkkinen, the executive director of the Newspaper Guild in Chicago, said the pickets hoped the board members "would talk some sense into Charlie Brumback." Charles T. Brumback is the chief executive of the Tribune Company.
Mr. Hoge is not a member of the board but appeared at its request to report on the status of The News, a Tribune Company spokeswoman, Martha Lindeman, said.
In his statement, Mr. Hoge said he told the board that circulation had increased "despite continued violent intimidation against newsstand dealers and small retail store owners."
The circulation increases had been achieved, he said, by raising the number of dealers and street hawkers selling the paper. The total of such outlets, Mr. Hoge said, now approaches half of the 12,000 outlets that sold the News before the strike.
Mr. Hoge said that at the same time the company continues to try to publish and increase its circulation, that it will "make every effort to achieve fair and reasonable collective-bargaining settlements with the assistance of the Federal mediation service." Representatives of The News and the striking unions are to meet Wednesday in Washington with the head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, Bernard DeLury.
Both sides have expressed hope that the meeting, the first involving management, all of the striking unions and an outside mediator, will lead to a breakthrough in negotiations, which have been stalled for 11 months.
In New York City, the 52-year-old Federal law that allowed The News to fill the jobs of striking workers with permanent nonunion employees came under new attack today.
 
Accusations of Intimidation
 Representatives of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor David N. Dinkins and three union representatives asserted that the practice not only hinders collective bargaining, but also is a factor in strike-related violence.
The News has accused its nine striking unions of conspiring to terrorize news vendors and nonunion employees through violence and intimidation. Unions leaders have denied the accusation, and senior police officials said last month that they had found no evidence of a centrally coordinated effort.
Governor Cuomo's Labor Commissioner, Thomas F. Hartnett, told a Senate subcommittee hearing in lower Manhattan today that the use of permanent replacements -- a practice he called "the industrial equivalent of capital punishment" -- causes "bitterness and hostility that leads to violence."
Eric J. Schmertz, Mayor Dinkins's Labor Relations Commissioner, agreed. "It is not illogical to conclude," he said, that workers who find themselves permanently replaced "may resort to unlawful action and commit acts or threats of violence because the economic burden on them becomes too severe."
 
Law to Outlaw Replacements
 Mr. Schmertz and Mr. Hartnett were among six witnesses who testified at the hearing, which was conducted by Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, and Representative Major R. Owens, Democrat of Brooklyn. Mr. Metzenbaum has introduced legislation to outlaw the use of permanent replacements.
The News declined to send a representative to testify, a fact Senator Metzenbaum said, "I particularly regret."
Since Mr. Reagan's action, according to a study last June by the General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress, there has been a sharp increase in employers' use of permanent replacements. The study found that in 1989, the practice was used in 30 percent of strikes, up from 23 percent in 1985.
 
Cardinal Speaks Out
 Mr. Hartnett told Senator Metzenbaum that he was convinced that the practice permanently destroys "any vestige of equality" at the bargaining table.
The Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, John Cardinal O'Connor, saying he spoke as "the proud son of a lifelong union man," said that he could see no clear moral justification for using permanent replacement workers. The Cardinal told the hearing that had The News not been armed with "the weapon of permanent replacement," the seemingly minor labor squabble that helped prompt the strike "would have fizzled out very quickly."
The other witnesses at the hearing yesterday were George E. McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council; Theodore W. Kheel, legal adviser to the striking unions, and Otilio Mighty, a striking driver.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 14, 1990, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the strike at The Daily News referred incompletely to the newspaper's response to a Congressional hearing in New York City on Tuesday about the hiring of workers to replace strikers. While the paper did not send a representative to testify, it did submit a detailed written statement of its position.

HEADLINE: Clarke to Be Renamed as Comptroller

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
President Bush decided today to reappoint Robert L. Clarke as the nation's top regulator of nationally chartered banks, taking the advice of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady over the objection of the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu.
The nomination of Mr. Clarke as Comptroller of the Currency had been recommended weeks ago by Mr. Brady. It had been considered a foregone conclusion, especially since the office is a division of the Treasury Department, until Mr. Sununu stepped in earlier this month. He raised concerns that tough regulation of the banking community was contributing to the current credit crunch, reflecting views he had heard from bankers in New England. 
 Mr. Clarke's five-year term expired on Dec. 2, but he has remained in the post while the President considered the reappointment. Democrats in Congress have come to Mr. Clarke's defense, and he is not expected to face a hostile renomination hearing.
Senior bank officials and lobbyists said that while Mr. Clarke would probably be reappointed, the White House wanted to send a signal to regulators to be sensitive to the difficulties bankers face as real estate values plummet in many parts of the nation.
"At the very least, it's a shot across the bow," said L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, when reports of Mr. Sununu's objections came to light last week.
Mr. Clarke, who earlier this year told a Congressional panel that the industry had termed him "the regulator from hell," appeared responsive to Mr. Sununu's concerns.
"This is an extremely difficult time for lenders, borrowers and bank regulators," he said in a statement. "However, we can work through the current problems if lenders assume their responsibility to make loans and take reasonable risks, and if regulators follow a responsive, balanced approach that takes into account their regulatory responsibilities, current economic conditions and the very significant national interest in not unnecessarily depressing credit availability."
 
 'Time for Common Sense'
 "In short," he added, "I believe that now is a time for the application of common sense, a time when neither lenders nor regulators should overreact or be unresponsive."
Mr. Clarke, a 48-year-old Houston lawyer, came to Washington in 1985 at the request of his friend and fellow Texan, James A. Baker 3d, who was then President Ronald Reagan's Treasury Secretary. As Comptroller of the Currency, he regulates more than 4,200 nationally chartered banks, which hold about two-thirds of the assets of the commercial banking system.
A Treasury official who insisted on anonymity said Mr. Clarke's nomination had also been opposed by several large Republican contributors, who had asked Mr. Sununu to intervene.
 
Complaints From Bankers
 Difficulties between Mr. Sununu and Mr. Clarke began more than a year ago, the official said, when examiners from the Comptroller's office began looking at troubled real estate loans from the Northeast. Mr. Sununu, a former Governor of New Hampshire, then began receiving complaints from local bankers that the examinations were too tough, the official said. Mr. Sununu passed those complaints on to Mr. Clarke.
When a group of senior bank regulators met with President Bush last month about the state of the economy and the nation's banks, Mr. Sununu again raised concerns based on anecdotal information that too stringent regulation was causing credit tightening. Without naming the company or its bank, Mr. Sununu told the regulators that he knew of a New Hampshire institution that had paid its loans on time but was still having trouble getting financing.
At the meeting, the regulators were strongly defended by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who by several accounts told the President that a softening economy required the regulators to be vigilant against improper lending practices.

HEADLINE: 4 Billion Loss Seen by F.D.I.C.

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
The nation's senior bank regulator said today that the Federal fund that insures deposits would probably lose $4 billion or more this year.
The prediction, by L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, appeared to be another sign of the deterioration of the bank insurance system. It came less than three months after he had said that the fund would probably lose about $3 billion, a revision that itself was only a few months old. A loss of $4 billion for the year would put the fund at about $9 billion, only about $7 billion of which is readily available in cash. 
Mr. Seidman said that as a result, if the insurance fund was not reorganized, the F.D.I.C. might experience what he called "problems with liquidity" in 1991 that would require the agency to borrow money to bail out institutions that failed.
"It isn't a concern at the moment," he said. "It might become a concern during 1991 if the pace of failures increases."
 
Overhaul to Be Proposed
 With the insurance fund now at its lowest level in relation to deposits in its 56-year history, the Bush Administration is planning to propose an overhaul of the banking system that includes a reorganization of the bank insurance fund.
 Banks now contribute to the fund by paying a flat fee based on their size. Working with regulators at the F.D.I.C., Administration officials are preparing proposals to tie the payments to banks' financial health instead.
 The latest estimate on losses for the insurance fund includes banks that the F.D.I.C. knows with reasonable certainty would be closed by early next year. It came with a report by the F.D.I.C. that earnings for the third quarter for the nation's 12,399 federally insured banks were down 29 percent from the quarter before, to $3.75 billion.
 Unlike most businesses that are seasonal and compare quarterly results on a year-to-year basis, banks look at successive quarterly reports for trends. For the third quarter of last year, banks reported losses of $744 million, much of which was attributed to many banks adding to reserves to cover losses from loans to developing countries.
 Today's report also contained a host of other discouraging news about the banking industry.
 "Over all, the outlook for the fourth quarter has to be bleak," Mr. Seidman said. He said that real estate problems, particularly in the Northeast, continue to hurt many banks. The F.D.I.C. quarterly report showed that the larger banks -- those with more than $1 billion in assets -- were having the greatest troubles with poor earnings and low asset quality.
 
Consumer Delinquencies Rise
 There was a sharp increase in delinquent consumer loans, with a 10.4 percent increase in the third quarter. The delinquency rate for consumer loans was 20 percent higher in the first three quarters of 1990 than in the period last year.
 The F.D.I.C. also reported, for the first time, on the financial health of 479 savings banks, which are community-based lenders that hold about 10 percentof the nation's insured deposits. The F.D.I.C. said that these institutions posted losses of $771 million in the third quarter, $1.2 billion in the first nine months, and that one in every three had been losing money.
 On Monday, Lawrence Lindsey, an economic adviser to the White House, said that there was a "good chance" that a large bank in New England would fail soon. Mr. Seidman did not cite that today as the primary reason for his increase in estimating the loss to the bank insurance fund. Rather, he attributed the increased losses to two factors: greater-than-anticipated losses at the banks the F.D.I.C. expects to fail and additional bank failures generally.
 "It more than anything else reflects deteriorating values and therefore, increasing losses on failures," he said.
 
Lack of Working Capital
 Mr. Seidman said in an interview that the possible cash shortage might occur
 because of a lack of working capital that would be needed to take over failed banks. He said the bank insurance fund now had about $7 billion in cash. The rest of the fund consists of restricted funds or assets that are not immediately marketable.
 Mr. Seidman emphasized that any additional expenditures for deposit insurance would not be borne by taxpayers -- as is the case with the multibillion-dollar bailout of the savings and loan industry -- but by banks. Next month the F.D.I.C. will be considering another increase in the premiums paid by banks. Premiums are already scheduled to increase from 12 cents to 19.5 cents for every $100 in deposits in January.
 There was also bad news today for the savings and loan industry. Its chief regulator, T. Timothy Ryan Jr., told a House panel that new figures to be released on Thursday would show that significantly fewer savings institutions were profitable in the third quarter than the second quarter.
 "I'm concerned about it," Mr. Ryan told a House task force on the bailout of the savings and loan industry. "Deterioration in economic conditions, especially in real estate, is adversely affecting the propsects for recovery of many institutions."
 
New Accounting Rule
 The F.D.I.C. today also adopted a new accounting rule for banks that was the subject of intense lobbying by the banking industry and is expected to have a significant impact on the Government's ability to clean up the savings and loan debacle.
 The new rule covers the treatment of purchase mortgage servicing rights, which are increasingly finding their way into the portfolios of banks that buy failed savings institutions.
 Such rights are contracts bought or held by banks and savings associations under which the institution handles a portfolio of mortgages -- processing the monthly payments, distributing the proceeds among investors and handling foreclosures.
 The agency ruled that up to 50 percent of a bank's regulatory capital could consist of purchase mortgage servicing rights. It had no previous standard, but considered the treatment of such rights on a case-by-case basis.
 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates nationally chartered banks, is reconsidering its standard for such rights. It now permits up to 25 percent of such rights to constitute capital.

Office Space Slumping In Chicago

BYLINE: By Cheryl Kent

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
SAPLINGS are being planted at the corners of a vacant downtown block that has become a symbol of Chicago's deflated building boom. With trees in place, the site will presumably look less forlorn until the city's slumping property market improves.
The Block 37 project, as it is known, is on hold. The land is across the street from the Richard J. Daley Plaza and one block from City Hall. It is to be the site of a $350 million office and retail project. 
 The development team consists of a consortium of Chicago's largest and most powerful developers, including Metropolitan Structures, JMB Realty and the Levy Organization. "We can't start without tenants, and we don't have them now," said Bernard Weissbourd, chairman of Metropolitan Structures.
With financing dried up and major tenants hard to find, developers in Chicago are postponing groundbreakings. Sixteen projects amounting to 21 million square feet are on hold. Among these is a 125-story building proposed by Miglin-Beitler Inc., a Chicago development concern. The building was to succeed the Sears Tower as the tallest building in the world, but so far no financing for the project has been obtained.
The office vacancy rate here reached 14.5 percent in October, the highest it has been since 1974, according to Coldwell Banker Commercial Real Estate Services in Chicago. The rate rose three percentage points since June as five million square feet of office space came on the market.
Although a total of 8.4 million square feet is now under construction, none of those projects is scheduled for completion this year, leading to expectations that vacancy rates will not rise in the fourth quarter.
Chicago is no worse off than other cities. The Real Estate Research Corporation's report on emerging trends in real estate in 1991 ranked Chicago fifth in the perceptions of business people about the prospects of real estate markets' attracting developers, investors and lenders. Los Angeles ranked third and New York 12th.
All the cities in the ranking, based on 112 interviews with real estate experts, have slipped. For 1990, Chicago had a rating of 6.7; for 1991 it is 5.4. New York's 1990 rating was 6.2; 1991's is 3.8.
Among the projects that are under way in Chicago is a 50-story office building by the Prime Group at 77 West Wacker Drive. It represents a kind of deal that is not available any longer; the tower is being financed by Swiss and Japanese banks, a development partnership of the Prime and the Kemper Investors Life Insurance Company.
Commercial brokers say that the deals that brought pension funds, insurance companies, foreign investors and commercial banks, sometimes in combinations, into joint ventures with developers on new projects can no longer be made.
One by one, these sources of financing are drying up. Jolts to Japan's stock market have made investors from that country pull back from American real estate. Pension funds and insurance companies have been disappointed by their returns on real estate and are becoming cautious about investing more.
Because of the savings and loan crisis, Federal banking regulators are concerned about the heavy commitments of banks in real estate loans. Some developers say that new underwriting requirements imposed on commercial banks by regulators are the immediate cause of the halt in construction.
"The real estate industry is out of capital," said Richard Hanson, president of Stein & Company of Chicago, which has developed several downtown office towers. "You need lots of equity now, and I'm talking about 40 to 50 percent. We have been put into a regulated recession by changes in the underwriting."
Many new buildings that have come on the market recently are only slowly being leased. Lincoln Properties' 1.3-million-square-foot building at 311 South Wacker Drive opened in May and is only 25 percent leased. The cleared sites for the project's second and third phases have been landscaped and paved over for parking.
"Projects like this exert a continued downward pressure on rents," said Richard Kateley, president of the Real Estate Research Corporation. "Tenants have multiple options for low rents, so they can bargain."
Asking rents for prime space range from $22 to $32 a square foot a year. Deals are actually being made at rents ranging from $16 to $27 a square foot, the reseach corporation said.
Chicago experienced intensive development over the last 10 years, partly because of its low vacancy rates, which stood at just 4 percent in 1980. Since 1987 Chicago has added nearly 11 million square feet to its inventory of office space. Of a total of just over 100 million square feet downtown, 15 million square feet is now unoccupied.
Predictions vary as to how long the downturn will last. With two million square feet absorbed annually, estimates are that it will be at least four to five years before significant new construction starts again.

HEADLINE: Cityspire, Music at Its Peak

BYLINE: By Monroe Price; Monroe Price is dean of Yeshiva University's Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.

 BODY:
Cityspire, that lipstick-like 72-story edifice on West 56th Street near Seventh Avenue, has been accused of emitting a high-pitched whistle that distracts New Yorkers from Ninth to Third Avenues. The sound apparently is created by wind blowing over louvers on its dome, about 800 feet above the ground.
In our city, beset by so many ills caused by the onslaught of modernity, this novel "crime" has immediately been taken as evidence of yet another generation of insults to the senses: inhumanely gigantic buildings that are now heard as well as seen. 
 The first, predictable reaction of bureaucrats was to "arrest" the building for speaking out of turn -- to issue a summons against its surprised developer, Ian Bruce Eichner. This is far too unimaginative a response to a sound that, admittedly, can make the neighbors crazed on a blustery day.
Before New York officialdom levies an $880 fine for violating the noise control code -- before it requires the architect to alter the dome -- the community should attempt to understand what the building is trying to say. (After all, don't suburbanites interpret creaks in the attic at night?) Maybe we need a linguist who has deciphered the eerie songs of whales or the chit-chat of dolphins.
Is Cityspire's whistle a lonely call for companionship to Citibank's far-off tower in Long Island City, a sirenlike wooing of the World Trade Center, a fraternal nod to the Empire State Building, which has seen more towering days?
Maybe it is a cry of sympathy for Cityspire's lower floors, which worry about the real estate recession. Or an echo of the winds of fortune that rise and fall through increasingly vacated acres of Financial District office buildings.
As we come to appreciate Cityspire's whistle, perhaps we will not condemn it so readily. As with graffiti and other detritus of today's world, desperate New Yorkers may even come to value it as an art form. One day, the Municipal Art Society might even oppose construction modifications that would alter a building's sounds -- a step in the direction of landmarking the music of the architectural spheres.
Let's not, just yet, think of Cityspire's wail as another sign of environmental doom: the aural equivalent of global warming. Let's not explain the sound, as one newspaper did, by likening it to the result of bursts of air across the neck of a soda bottle.
To enrich, rather than impoverish, our urban lives, we might think of Cityspire's sound not as a whistle but as the voice of a mythical Wind -- Zephyr or Boreas or Eurus -- as it expresses itself in the Aeolian cave of the gods, as a kind of monologue in the sky. Or, more simply, as winter's cold heights humming an up-to-date version of "The Tin Roof Blues."

HEADLINE: 6 States Accuse GMAC on Escrow

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Attorneys general in six states have filed suit against the GMAC Mortgage Corporation, accusing the lender of overcharging consumers by millions of dollars in excessive escrow payments.
The action seeks to bar the Detroit-based lender, part of the financial services operations of the General Motors Corporation, from building big cushions into escrow accounts and to force GMAC to recalculate the way it determines escrow payments. GMAC holds 400,000 mortgages nationwide.
Attorneys general in New York, California, Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Texas filed suit yesterday in Federal court in Manhattan.
The six states acted because the Federal Government has not enforced its own laws against the practice, Attorney General Robert Abrams of New York said. Mr. Abrams said that if the suit was successful, homeowners could receive millions of dollars in refunds.
Officials from GMAC declined to comment on the suit.
In April, the attorneys general released a study critical of the practice by mortgage lenders of requiring excess funds in escrow accounts.
"When we released the report of the illegal escrow practices of GMAC and other lenders, we urged the Federal Government to enforce its own statutory limits on escrow payments," Mr. Abrams said. "So far, it has taken no action." That has prompted suits like this one "at great cost to the states," Mr. Abrams added.
The study said consumers were being overcharged $2 billion to $4 billion by the nation's mortgage lenders.
Lenders maintain escrow accounts to make payments for property taxes, insurance and other items that borrowers must pay. Extra money in escrow accounts hurts consumers but is a bonanza for lenders, who pay a low rate of interest or nothing for use of the funds, regulators say. About two-thirds of the nation's home mortgages involve escrow accounts.
Federal law limits lenders to a two-month "cushion" in escrow -- enough money to make payments for two months. The cushion allows lenders to make tax and insurance payments even if the consumer's monthly payment is late.
"Our report estimated that the 'excess cushion' averages about $150 per homeowner," Attorney General Tom Miller of Iowa said. "That means we think lenders are holding several billion dollars that should be in the hands of their customers."
The report called on the Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Jack Kemp, to tighten enforcement of the law. The attorneys general said inaction by the agency had led them to file the suit.
The study focused on big lenders that operate nationwide. A survey of four of the largest -- Citibank, GMAC Mortgage, the Fleet Mortgage Corporation and the Lomas Financial Group -- "indicated that lenders may be holding excessive and illegal cushions in more than 70 percent of escrow accounts."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Quiet Trading And Gold Prices Are Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar drifted lower against foreign currencies yesterday in what traders said was one of the quietest trading days of the year.
Gold prices were mixed.
With currency trading thinned by the pre-holiday season, the dollar eased largely on technical factors, mostly ignoring the day's few external influences. 
 "A lot of people are already sidelined for the holidays," said Gabriele Schmitt, vice president for the Bank of New York. "We had absolutely no indicators come out today."
Traders said the British pound showed signs of strength after the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, said British interest rates would remain at their current level and not be lowered.
Sterling strengthened to $1.9502 in New York from late Tuesday's $1.9380, and in London, the pound rose to $1.9435, from $1.9400 late Tuesday.
But traders said the market shrugged off an early-day rumor that Iraq would withdraw its troops from Kuwait before the Jan. 15 deadline imposed in a resolution passed last month by the United Nations. The rumor later proved to be untrue.
The resolution permits the use of military force against Iraq if the country remains in occupied Kuwait beyond the mid-January deadline.
"People are pretty happy to stay square and not really get involved that much," said Renato Strauss, currency trader at Bank Julius Baer & Co. "I had one of the lowest volume days of the year."
The dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen in New York, closing at 131.45 yen, from 132.40 late Tuesday. In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 131.88 Japanese yen from 131.75 yen at Tuesday's close, and later in London it was quoted at 131.75 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's prices, included: 1.4756 German marks, down from 1.4784; 1.2610 Swiss francs, down from 1.2650; 5.0120 French francs, down from 5.0190; 1,112.00 Italian lire, down from 1,114.00, and 1.1606 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
Gold rose in New York, closing up 70 cents a troy ounce, to $372.70, on the Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $371.45 a troy ounce, down 55 cents from late Tuesday.
Silver fell on the Commodity Exchange in New York to $4.026 a troy ounce, down 4.1 cents. It also fell in London to a late bid price of $4.03 a troy ounce, from $4.06 bid late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: In Urals City, the Communist Apparatus Ends but Not the Communist Power

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SVERDLOVSK, U.S.S.R.

 BODY:
Until recently, the ornate green building at the corner of Pushkin and Lenin Streets housed an intimidating organization called the Sverdlovsk People's Control Committee.
The committee, part of a nationwide citizens' network run by the Communist Party to inspect the work of government and industrial enterprises, was abolished last summer by the democratic reformers who have swept into office in the Russian Republic. 
 Today the wood-paneled office suite is occupied by a new power, the Ural Regional Association of International Trade Cooperation, a commercial export agency. Within days of its creation in September, the association was awarded a priority government license to help market $2 billion worth of surplus production of local manufacturers.
And the general director of this lucky new venture? He is Vladimir K. Gaffner, who before becoming a trade middleman was chairman of the Sverdlovsk People's Control Committee.
 
Little Changing of Guard
 Eight months after Sverdlovsk voted out the Communist old guard in its first contested City Council elections, this Urals industrial stronghold is discovering -- along with many other cities -- that real power has not changed hands, and in some cases has not even changed desks.
The new City Council has inherited much of the public discontent over empty grocery stores, inflation and rising street crime. But local officials and journalists say the quality of life in the city still depends largely on an unelected elite that controls the flow of money, privilege and influence.
This interlocking directorate includes the military-industrial complex, the unelected executive bureaucracy, the police agencies and the adaptable Communist Party, which is now parlaying its great wealth into commercial power.
"People blame the new democrats for everything," said Sergei Plotnikov, a local reporter who has long specialized in law enforcement issues. "But power still belongs to all these mafias."
 
Center of Arms Industry
 Sverdlovsk, a city of 1.35 million people, is the heart of the Soviet heavy machinery industry, a category that includes tanks, rockets and other military hardware as well as excavators, rolling mills and oil derricks.
The Mayor estimates that nearly a third of the workforce makes weapons. The gray stone building housing the military industrial ministries, known locally as the "Pentagon," fills an entire city block.
Access to the city is controlled not by the City Council but by the military and K.G.B., which until recently had never admitted an American reporter. Recently the city has begun opening to foreigners as local industry desperately seeks Western investment.
Two of the leading rivals in current Soviet politics are products of Sverdlovsk.
President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian Republic began as the Communist Party boss of Sverdlovsk province. He remains a popular hero here, the exemplar of a nationwide democratic insurgency that helped oust the Communists in the city elections.
 
Ryzhkov's Legacy Lives
 Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, the Soviet Prime Minister, ran this city's gigantic Uralmash machine tool plant. He is regarded now as a feckless politician and an emblem of the past.
Yet Mr. Ryzhkov's legacy lives on on Sverdlovsk, perhaps larger than Mr. Yeltsin's.
The Uralmash plant, for example, which turns out giant machines for mining and processing industries -- with a sideline in tank components -- rules the largest of several urban fiefs that has been virtually untouched by the election of a new City Council.
The Uralmash neighborhood at the northern edge of Sverdlovsk is a sprawling, company-maintained micro-city of 180,000 residents. The company provides cheap apartments, kindergartens and food packets for its workers and for a whole community of doctors, teachers and clerks who serve them.
The company pays all its taxes to Moscow, which decides how much to share with the city.
 
'We Have Our Own City'
 "Why do we need them?" Anatoly S. Osintsev, deputy general director of Uralmash, said when asked the enterprise's relationship with the City Council. "We have our own city -- 180,000 people. Isn't that a city? It's all on our budget."
Even such an elementary city service as police protection is in large part beyond the control of the local government.
This fall salesmen from Interpass Ltd., an Irvington, N.Y., police equipment company, arrived here to peddle handcuffs and body armor to the local police.
Their customer, it turned out, was not the Sverdlovsk City Council. It was a consortium of factories that had pooled some of their foreign currency earnings and bypassed the government to fight crime.
The City Council, elected in March, is nominally responsible for making sure the state stores are stocked with ample food and consumer goods for the population, but there, too, the city is dependent on its industry.
 
State Stores Barren
 In the past Sverdlovsk lived better than other parts of the country, because the central Government in Moscow took pains to feed its military-industrial workers. But the central distribution system has broken down as farm regions hoard food for themselves, and state stores here have become as barren as those in Moscow.
The Mayor of Sverdlovsk, Yuri Y. Samarin, said the city has little to trade with farm regions for food because most of its industry produces heavy equipment for the state.
The city has tried to stimulate small enterprises, and has legalized several free-market stores that sell Finnish boots, children's clothes from China and Western beer and cigarettes at high prices.
But many would-be entrepreneurs have fallen prey to organized crime or been crushed by state and industrial trading organizations that are not eager for competition.
 
Impatient With Democracy
 As in other cities where newcomers are in the majority, the failure to put food in the stores has made the public impatient with the tedious business of democracy.
"They pass a lot of pretty laws, but nothing changes," said a student at the Urals Polytechnical Institute, where the alumni include both Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Ryzhkov.
Sergei L. Nazarov, who works for a commercial publishing enterprise, said many citizens believed that the new city councilmen had already been seduced by the perks of the job.
"You know the Arab fable about a dragon sitting on a pile of gold?" he asked. "A young man goes out and slays the dragon, and when he sits on top of the pile of gold he himself turns into a dragon.
"That is us. The pile of gold is privileges."
 
Public Expectations Faulted
 Mr. Samarin, a former engineer at a rocket factory who was chosen as Mayor with backing from the democratic insurgents, said the public expected too much from a city government that is inexperienced and has little leverage.
"There has been far too much talk about perestroika, while all the while the old administrative system is allowed to live on," he said. "This is where the disappointment comes from."
The most effective tool the city has had so far has been a kind of blackmail, using the threat of worker unrest to extract concessions from the authorities in Moscow.
This fall the city sent an appeal to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Mr. Ryzhkov threatening to withhold marketable commodities like nickel from the defense industry unless the food situation improved.
 
Moscow Increases Deliveries
 "There was a threat of deep social unrest in the city, and we were forced to make a decision to appeal to the Government," the Mayor said. "We said, 'Give us what we are entitled to, since we cannot feed ourselves, or we will be forced to appeal to work collectives to take part of their output to be used in barter deals.' "
Mr. Ryzhkov agreed to increase deliveries from the central food fund, and also issued an order letting Sverdlovsk companies sell a certain portion of their goods abroad to raise money for consumer supplies.
The Communists, reduced in the elections to a minority in the City Council, have been adapting to defeat by tightening their grip on other levers of power.
The party still has an entrenched presence in the government apparatus, the city and provincial executive committees that can cut a citizen's red tape or tie him up in a bureaucratic straitjacket. Theoretically these agencies are the working arms of the elected councils, but in practice they are often the only ones with the connections to get anything done.
 
Party Goes Commercial
 In Sverdlovsk, as elsewhere in the Soviet Union, the party is shoring up its position by pumping its wealth into commercial joint ventures, small businesses and trading organizations.
The party owns the best hotel in town, which it puts at the disposal of factories and visiting trade delegations. It has the best computers and printing services, and its 22-story office tower dominates the skyline.
Stanislav V. Yachevsky, a city councilman, sees Communists exploiting this period of confusion to build comfortable new niches for themselves.
"Then when the structure begins to fall apart, they will have a way to retreat," he said. "They will be powerful again, but it will be commercial power rather than ideological. It is a great danger."
Mr. Plotnikov, the journalist, agreed, saying: "The party is the fifth column in the market economy. They serve a purpose, but the harm outweighs the good. Even the most honest of them has bad habits in his blood."

HEADLINE: G.M. and Ford Wary on '91; Gulf Outcome Called a Key

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 12

 BODY:
The clouded economic outlook is forcing the nation's two biggest auto makers to hedge their bets for 1991, with sales projections trimmed and the level of dividend payments perhaps in question.
A crucial issue for the economy and Detroit, top executives of General Motors and Ford agreed today in year-end news conferences, will be the outcome of the crisis in the Persian Gulf. 
 Philip E. Benton Jr., president of the Ford Motor Company, said the company's $3 annual dividend might not be sustainable next year if the economy continued to be weak and war broke out in the Middle East.
For its part, the General Motors Corporation is forecasting industrywide domestic car and truck sales of about 13.5 million units for 1991, said Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chairman, down about 5 percent from the 14.2 million to 14.3 million vehicles expected to be sold this year.
The company's forecast assumes there will not be armed conflict in the Middle East, Mr. Stempel said. Otherwise, the total could be lower. Lloyd E. Reuss, G.M.'s president, said several assembly plants in the United States would be temporarily idled in 1991 for extensive retooling for model changes. He added that some assembly line speeds would be slowed and workers laid off to match production with lower sales.
Mr. Stempel declined to speculate on whether G.M.'s cash dividend on common stock was secure at its current rate, but he said the No. 1 auto maker "is financially strong."
Mr. Benton's statement is the first from a top Ford executive suggesting that finances might be tight for the No. 2 auto maker in the industry's downturn.
The Chrysler Corporation, the weakest of the three, last week declared its regular quarterly dividend. A spokesman said Chrysler's forecast is for industry sales of 13.8 million cars and trucks in 1991 but added that the number could dip below 13 million or climb to 14 million, depending on the severity of the downturn.
The shares of the Big Three have been trading at relatively weak prices and high dividend yields for several months because investors believe that dividend cuts are possible, analysts say. General Motors and Chrysler posted losses for the third quarter, and Ford reported a steep drop in profits.
"Ford's statement confirms what the stock market has already been thinking," said Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch. "It doesn't come as a shock."
Until recently, Ford executives have said that cost-cutting and restructuring would allow the company to make money and maintain its dividend even in a recession. Ford is planning on 1991 industry sales of about 13.5 million vehicles.
"If hostilities break out, oil prices may again skyrocket and the outlook for the economy and the auto industry would be quite different," said Harold A. Poling, Ford's chairman, in a statement.

HEADLINE: White Men Get Better Deals on Cars, Study Finds

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Research on scores of car dealerships here has found that salespeople who bargain with customers over the price of a new car make significantly lower final offers to white men than to women or blacks.
The findings, by a research group established by the American Bar Association, were based on more than 550 visits to dealerships in the Chicago area by researchers who posed as middle-class car buyers. The researchers sought to follow a set of carefully rehearsed negotiating tactics to extract the best final offers from the salespeople. 
 Ian Ayres, an assistant professor at the Northwestern University School of Law who wrote the study, said the results raised questions about whether civil-rights laws were adequate to protect black and women consumers against discrimination.
 
Unregulated Markets
 "The civil rights laws of the 1960's picked out only a handful of markets -- employment, housing and public accommodations -- and left virtually unregulated much larger markets for retail goods and services," said Mr. Ayres, who is a lawyer and an economist. "It was important to determine whether discrimination has an effect in these markets as well."
The researchers noted that the pattern persisted regardless of the race and sex of the salesperson.
The research, described by experts as the first to test for racial or sexual discrimination in new car sales, was commissioned by the American Bar Foundation, an organization founded by the bar. It is an independent, nonprofit organization based in Chicago that conducts research on the law, legal institutions and the legal professions.
A spokesman for the National Automobile Dealers Association, Allan Wilbur, who had not seen the research, said he could not comment on it but said the association believed that all customers should be treated the same, regardless of race or sex.
Mr. Ayres based his conclusions on two related surveys.
The results of the first study, which took place about 18 months ago, will be the subject of an article in the February issue of the Harvard Law Review.
 
90 Dealers in Study
 In that survey, three white male researchers divided among them 90 car dealers and then visited the concerns, trying to negotiate the best possible offer on the price of a new car. At about the same time, each of those dealers was also visited by one of three other testers -- a white female, a black male and a black female -- who bargained over the same car.
When the results of the first study of some 165 visits were tabulated, the white men were found to have received final offers that averaged about $11,362 on a new automobile with a dealer sticker price of about $13,465. The researchers said the dealer's cost of the car, which included air conditioning and power steering, was about $11,000. The make and model of the car were not disclosed.
By contrast, the white female researcher was given an average final price of about $11,504, a price containing a markup that was was about 40 percent higher than that offered to white men. The black male was given an average price of $11,783, containing more than double the markup than that offered to the white men. The black woman was given an average price of $12,237, with three times the markup.
Mr. Ayres noted in his study that discrimination appeared to be a factor even in the dealer's initial offer, before any negotiations had begun. When the researchers asked the salesperson for the first, best offer, they quoted an average price of about $11,818 for white males, $11,829 for the white female, $12,534 for the black male, and $13,169 for the black female.
A more comprehensive follow-up study, completed more recently, involved 36 testers, including five black males, eight black females, six white females and 17 white males. The testers made more than 400 visits to some 200 showrooms and bargained over nine models of cars.
That study showed similar disparities in the dealers' treatment of the testers, Mr. Ayres said, except that this time the highest final quotes were given to black men.
 
'A Closer Look'
 "When car bargaining ends up hurting those people in society who have already been traditionally disadvantaged, I think we need to take a closer look at the process," said Mr. Ayres.
As in tests for bias in housing, with individuals posing as buyers to determine whether real estate agents discriminated on the basis of race in the sale or rental of houses and apartments, the aim of the new research was to measure discrimination, rather than investigate its cause.
But in trying to interpret his findings, Mr. Ayres suggested that the results might reflect dealers' beliefs about how much they can get from various groups of people, rather than outright or intentional bigotry.
He said there might be a shared and perhaps even subconscious assumption among many salespeople that blacks and women are less knowledgeable or adept at the bargaining process than are white males, and that they therefore are more willing to accept an offer that gives the dealer a higher markup.
Mr. Ayres describes this process as the sellers' "search for suckers," an attempt to concentrate profits in sales to a relatively few customers who will pay the higher markups.
 
Access to Data Is Key
 "The reason a larger proportion of blacks or women are more willing to pay a higher markup does not suggest they are inferior," said Mr. Ayres. Rather, there is an inference they may have less access to information about the automobile bargaining process, or have done less comparison shopping.
He cited a survey of consumers last spring by the Consumer Federation of America as finding that 37 percent did not know that the price of a new car was negotiable. When the responses were broken down by race, Mr. Ayres said, 61 percent of blacks said they did not know they could bargain over price, compared to 31 percent of whites.
Pamela Karlan, professor of law at the University of Virginia and a specialist in sex discrimination and civil rights matters, said she was not surprised by the findings. "You see it happening all the time in housing cases, even though housing is supposedly regulated," she said. "And the courts have held that stereotyping people on the basis of sex or race is intentional discrimination," she added, even though it was not based on bigotry.
Although bigotry may be a factor as well, its effect is harder to divine, Mr. Ayres said. In fact, the researchers in the Northwestern study often received the worst offer from salespeople of the same race and sex.
 
Changes in Marketplace
 Mr. Wilbur, of the car dealers' association, which represents 20,000 of the nation's dealers, said the industry was trying to do a better job of dealing with what he called the changing nature of the marketplace, in which consumers, including a growing number of women, are better informed and are demanding better service.
To that end, he said the trade group next year would begin a sales certification program aimed at setting standards for showroom sales staffs. Among other things, it will include courses on ethics, contract law and sales psychology, he said.
Remar Sutton, a former automobile dealer and the author of a 1981 book entitled "Don't Get Taken Every Time," said the new study's findings underscored the central strategy of automobile sales: the weaker the person, the stronger the profit.
The salesperson will not give the same deal to most women or blacks that will be offered to whites, he said, because there is an unstated assumption that white males have more bargaining experience. "It's not racism, except to the extent that if you are a salesman, you learn over time you can make a lot more money off poor blacks and some women," said Mr. Sutton, who writes a booklet aimed at educating consumers on the purchase and financing of automobiles.
The researchers who conducted the survey were schooled in a uniform strategy, with questions and behavior part of the design of the study. They were dressed casually, but neatly, as college-educated, urban professionals from 24 to 28 years of age. They were told to say, if asked, that they lived in an upscale Chicago neighborhood. They also told the salesperson that they intended to finance the purchase themselves.
Mr. Ayres said those who believe they are the victims of racial discrimination in a retail transaction can bring civil lawsuits under civil rights laws outlawing racial bias in contracting. Those laws were enacted after the Civil War. But he said there were no statutes to protect women from discrimination in retail sales.

HEADLINE: THE TRADE DECISION;
Bush's Move Unlikely to Mean Quick Trade Surge

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
President Bush's major step today toward normalizing commercial relations with the Soviet Union will increase American farm exports, but is unlikely in the short term to lead to a big surge in two-way trade.
The two countries will sell each other about $3.6 billion worth of goods this year -- little more than what the United States exchanges with Haiti. 
 The immediate impact of the decision today will be to give the Soviets Agriculture Department and Export-Import Bank credits to buy more American food and industrial products.
Moscow is expected to seek $1 billion in food credits during the current fiscal year, which ends next Sept. 30, according to Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter.
 
A Threat by the Soviets
 The Soviets had threatened that if the credits were withheld they would swing more of their purchases to the European Community and other food suppliers already offering generous credit terms.
Moscow can get up to $300 million of credits from the Export-Import Bank. The Stevenson Amendment to the 1974 Trade Act says Federal agencies may not lend or guarantee more than that in loans to finance exports to the Soviet Union unless Congress certifies that the Soviet Union has ended its limits on emigration. The Administration is considered likely to seek repeal of the amendment next year.
Companies like Upjohn, which is planning Soviet pharmaceutical plants, or International Business Machines, which is planning to sell tens of thousands of personal computers, are understood to be among those seeking the Export-Import Bank credits.
"There's a great deal of demand from the Soviet Union and a lot of big, medium and small companies that want to do business there," said John D. Macomber, Export-Import Bank president.
He predicted in an interview that the bank -- which, like similar institutions in other industrial countries, gives loans to finance exports -- would sign its first deal "within the next month."
 
Lower Duties Will Result
 Early next year, the President is expected to send to Congress the trade agreement the two countries concluded earlier this year, which sets the economic framework for their enterprises to establish deeper footholds in each other's markets. Under that agreement, normalization of trade relations between the two nations can take place only after the Soviet Parliament passes a law codifying free movement of people into and out of the country.
Once Congress assents, sharply lower duties would be charged on Soviet imports. This could help the Soviets sell more goods in the United States.
All Soviet products sold here -- including vodka, caviar, anhydrous ammonia, fiberboard, porcelain statues and other products -- would enter the United States at the most favored nation tariff rates, the lowest level granted to any country.
Duties on Soviet imports now are as much as 10 times higher as those on goods from other countries. On vodka, for example, the change could mean a consumer saving of as much as $1.25 a bottle.
 
'Only Good Things' Expected
 That trade will increase is almost certain. "The Soviet Union is the biggest untapped market in the world," said Margaret Chapman, director of the trade forum of the American Committee on U.S. Soviet-Relations, a Washington-based public policy organization representing business and academic interests.
"Only good things will come from this decision," she added.
But whether Soviet-American trade takes off depends in large measure on what happens to the Soviet economy, now going through a series of painful changes.
To support Soviet restructuring efforts, President Bush proposed a "special association" of the Soviet Union with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to give Moscow access to the economic and financial expertise of these institutions.
This could mean a special status for the Soviets in the institution, which would put Moscow somewhere between full membership and nonmembership, according to the White House.
The two giant credit organizations advise countries on ways to improve economic performance, conditioning their loans on the countries' willingness to take the counsel.
 
Help From the I.M.F.
 The White House said that under the plan the I.M.F. would provide technical assistance on financial, exchange rate, tax reform and banking policies while the World Bank would advise on revamping broad sectors of the economy, such as transportation and energy.
Sometime later the Soviets will probably seek full membership in the institutions, which count 154 other nations as members and have combined assets of nearly $400 billion.
The Soviet Union was vice chairman of the 1944 Bretton Woods conference, at which the two organizations were created. Stalin then pulled out as the cold war began.
Officials of the two organizations said the proposals would be taken up shortly in their executive boards.
Because of large food exports, the United States runs a big trade surplus with the Soviet Union.
Most of what the United States buys from the Soviets is raw materials. The biggest import is fuel oil, followed by anhydrous ammonia used to make fertilizer, palladium and such products as fur skins, vodka, caviar, woven cotton fabric and crabs cooked in their shells.

HEADLINE: Official Sees Consistency in Scholarship Rule

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
As an undergraduate and a law student at the University of Southern California in the late 1970's, Michael L. Williams challenged the university to increase its number of minority students.
But as head of the civil rights office in the Education Department, Mr. Williams is telling colleges and universities that if they give out scholarships based on race, except in narrow instances, they will be violating the law. 
 The 37-year-old Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights sees no inconsistency in the actions.
"You have to go back to the position that we took at Southern Cal," he said today. "We said the university needed to look at a lot of other variables besides the S.A.T. in selecting students. We urged them to look at economic disadvantage, whether students overcome large obstacles, et cetera. We did not urge them to say we will admit 15 black students a year."
 
A Fresh Wind in June
 Mr. Williams, a domestic policy analyst in George Bush's Presidential campaign in 1988, is a former Justice Department official. He was considered a fresh wind in a moribund agency when he took over the Education Department office in June.
Civil rights and education groups were cautiously optimistic that he would be sympathetic to their concerns, particularly because he emphasized the law-enforcement aspects of his office. He sought redress for anti-Asian admissions practices uncovered in a 30-month investigation at the University of California at Los Angeles. He also completed an investigation at Harvard University, concluding that there was no anti-Asian bias in admissions procedures there.
The Office of Civil Rights is responsible for enforcing Federal laws that prohibit discrimination based on race, sex, national original, handicap or age in all education programs or activities that receive Federal money.
In his confirmation hearings Mr. Williams said that his office could support education goals that the governors and the President have set for the nation by insuring that grouping students by ability was not carried out in discriminatory fashion and that children whose first language is not English were not disproportionately placed in special education programs. These are concerns of education and civil rights groups.
But Mr. Williams draws his educational philosophy from the early roots of the civil rights struggle and its search not for racially balanced schools or busing but for equal education opportunities for blacks.
Mr. Williams said today that the reaction to his policy prohibiting scholarships based on race was "maybe a bit of unnecessary frustration and anxiety." He added that he was not worried that without such scholarships universities and colleges would not increase the number of minority students in their institutions.
"There are a lot of forces out there that will force universities to do the right thing," Mr. Williams said. "We can get minority students into schools without saying that the only way you can get in is that there are five seats allocated here for you."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Effort Sells Bonds, But at a Price

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
After its most intensive marketing and lobbying campaign in years, New York City was able to sell almost $1.3 billion in long-term bonds yesterday, but the price to the city was high. It was the first such sale since the city's financial situation sharply deteriorated in the last few months.
Yields to investors ranged up to 8.5 percent for the longer-term tax-exempt bonds, under prices worked out in negotiations between city officials and a team of underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation. 
 Over the last few days, Mayor David N. Dinkins and a parade of city officials and business leaders met with representatives of bond rating agencies in a tense but successful effort to convince them that the administration was on top of the city's worsening finances and that the city's credit rating should not be lowered.
 
Lower Rates Than Expected
 But to attract investors the bonds sold at yields far higher than those of most other comparably rated bonds, or even higher than most bonds that have lower but still investment-grade ratings. That cost the city tens of millions of dollars in higher interest costs.
Underwriters said that once the ratings were reaffirmed -- A from Moody's Investors Service and A- from Standard & Poor's, which are medium- to high-investment-grade ratings -- there was strong interest by both institutional and individual investors. The bond offering was the largest in memory by the city, which is the largest single borrower in the municipal credit markets.
Bradford Higgins, a managing director at First Boston, said the tax-exempt bonds, totaling $950 million, had lower rates than many traders had expected.
Because of the strong interest in the bonds, the city was able to reduce yields yesterday evening. Late in the day, the city increased its offering of taxable bonds from about $200 million worth to $332 million because it had received several large orders.
The highest yield for these was almost 11 percent.
"Keeping the rating helped a lot," he said. "We are very pleased with the reception we have gotten. Compared to where New York City was a month ago you have got to view this as a vote of confidence."
The cost of borrowing has increased sharply since the the city last sold long-term bonds in September. For example, yesterday preliminary yields were 8.45 percent on bonds maturing in 15 years, an increase of 0.60 of a percentage point over the yields of similar bonds sold in September.
But during the same period, interest rates, including yields on municipal bonds, fell. An index of bonds compiled by the Delphis Hanover Corporation shows that on, average, yields on 15-year bonds rated A declined by 0.45 of a percentage point. So, in effect, the extra cost to the city is 1.05 percentage points more than for similar city bonds offered only four months ago.
This translates into more money to be paid to bondholders by the city over the life of the bonds. Each percentage point on the $1.1 billion in bonds translates into about $11 million in interest costs a year. So if the entire offering had consisted of 15-year bonds, the city would be paying $165 million more in interest than it would have on identical bonds sold four months earlier.
Last night Ms. Holtzman put the overall cost to the city of the tax-exempt borrowing at 8.35 percent, up from 7.9 percent in September.
The city is paying even higher costs than the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which has been struggling with financial problems and whose bonds have lower ratings. On Tuesday when Massachusetts sold $526 million in bonds, the top yield was 7.8 percent on 17-year bonds. Similar New York City bonds were yielding about 8.5 percent. The Massachusetts bonds were rated only Baa by Moody's and BBB by Standard & Poor's.
 
Meetings to Raise Confidence
 But rather than focusing on the high costs of the borrowing, city officials pointed to their intensive campaign to drum up demand for the city's bonds by lobbying institutional investors and rating agency officials and by using an investment vehicle the city had never used before, a zero-coupon bond, which was marketed as the New York CitySaver. The bond pays no yearly interest but sells at a deep discount. For instance, a few hundred dollars will buy a typical bond that will be worth $5,000 in the year 2005.
Deputy Mayor Sally Piniero-Hernandez said that in recent weeks Mayor Dinkins and City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman met with officials from each rating agency at least three times.
She said officials from both rating agencies were given helicopter tours of development sites and an intensive round of briefings.
"We told them pick any commissioner you like, and we will have them meet with you," she said. As a result they met with Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, and the Human Resources Administrator, Barbara Sabol.
 
'Marketplace Has Been Churning'
 Mark Page, a deputy city budget director, said uncertainty in the marketplace about the city had contributed to the high yields, as was the city's plan to hold more bond sales over the next few years.
"The marketplace has been churning over New York," he said. Now that the rating agencies have reaffirmed their ratings, he said, demand for New York bonds might increase.
The city is to sell $1 billion in bonds in February, but city officials said they were re-examining their schedule of borrowing.
One investor who has not been deterred is James Gammon, who manages municipal bond investments for the of Loews Corporation. Acting, in part, on the advice of former Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, who is now a consultant, Mr. Gammon began buying large quantities of New York City bonds in October on behalf of Loews and related entities as city bond prices fell.
With a portpolio of $350 million in city bonds, Loews quickly became the largest single holder of city bonds. Yesterday Mr. Gammon was said to be placing orders for more bonds.
"When the bonds got beat up, we started to buy," he said. "The bonds are selling like the city is going out of business. City bonds are a terrific bargain."
