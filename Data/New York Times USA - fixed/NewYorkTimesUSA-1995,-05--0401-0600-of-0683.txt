HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: MEDICARE;
G.O.P. May 'Go It Alone' On Medicare

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
Haley Barbour, the Republican national chairman, said today that he had reluctantly concluded that Republicans would have to "go it alone" in cutting projected spending on Medicare because President Clinton and Democrats in Congress had refused to join the effort.
But Mr. Barbour said Republicans could reap political dividends because they would receive most of the credit for saving Medicare from bankruptcy. 
 His comments were the first indication that Republicans were now contemplating unilateral action and party-line votes to redesign Medicare and slow the growth of the program, which serves 37 million elderly or disabled people.
"At this stage of the game it looks like the Republicans will have to go it alone," Mr. Barbour said today at a meeting with reporters. "As you know, we have asked repeatedly, publicly and privately, that the Administration join in a bipartisan effort to save Medicare."
But the White House has turned down such invitations, saying that House Republicans must first specify how they will reconcile their promises to balance the budget and cut taxes. In effect, the President has demanded that House Republicans drop their plans for a big tax cut before the Administration will discuss specific proposals to overhaul Medicare.
Republicans have enough votes in Congress to pass a Medicare bill, but not enough to override a veto. While Mr. Clinton might be inclined to veto a Republican bill that dealt only with Medicare, he may not get that opportunity. At least some of the changes needed to guarantee the program's solvency over the next 10 years may be wrapped into a bill cutting dozens of Federal programs. And before that, Congress may pass a bill requiring the Administration to submit recommendations to prevent depletion of the Medicare trust fund.
The six trustees responsible for the program, including four Administration officials, said last month that the Medicare trust fund would run out of money by the year 2002 if there were no changes in the current law.
But White House officials said the President was not interested in any plan to shore up the Medicare trust fund unless it also made improvements in the overall health care system and provided coverage to some of the 41 million Americans who have no health insurance now.
Disputing Mr. Barbour's assertions, Democrats said they doubted that the Republicans would win political credit for taking the steps now under consideration. Those steps include raising Medicare premiums, co-payments and other charges to beneficiaries.
"When co-payments start going up, you can't put a positive political spin on that," said Representative Earl Pomeroy, a Democrat from North Dakota who regulated health insurance as Insurance Commissioner of that state.
Gene Sperling, deputy assistant to the President for economic policy, said, "The real question is why the Republicans are refusing to work with us to reform Medicare in the context of a serious step-by-step approach to health care reform."
Mr. Barbour said he was not an expert on Medicare, but he displayed detailed knowledge of the program, its finances and the recommendations of various health policy experts. He said he believed that Republicans would not suffer devastating political damage if Americans understood the alternatives to the Republican proposals.
"I do not think there is a political dividend for dodging your responsibility in the face of what is a universally agreed crisis," Mr. Barbour said. "The Clinton Administration apparently thinks it's good politics to do nothing."
The fiscal blueprint approved today by the House would cut $283 billion, or 15 percent, from projected spending on Medicare over the next seven years. The plan developed by Senate Republicans would cut $256 billion, or 14 percent.
Mr. Barbour said such cutbacks "will not change in a drastic way the lives of the beneficiaries." But the American Association of Retired Persons said the changes would cause hardship for millions of elderly people, and the American Hospital Association said some inner-city hospitals would be forced to close.

HEADLINE: California Treasurer Joins Attack on Orange County

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
The California State Treasurer, Matthew Fong, yesterday joined the attack on officials of Orange County who are seeking to default on some $1.3 billion in short-term debt about to come due.
He said that such a default -- which appears increasingly imminent at the affluent, but bankrupt, county -- would raise borrowing costs for all California municipalities and could lead to a state takeover of Orange County's financial affairs by a control board similar to New York's Municipal Assistance Corporation. 
 Mr. Fong's words added strength to the growing outcry by mutual funds and investors who own Orange County securities.
He made his remarks at a municipal industry conference and after spending two days meeting with major holders of California securities in New York and Boston, including representatives of Fidelity Investments, Dreyfus Corporation, Alliance Capital and Putnam Investments, all of whom are alarmed by the possibility of a default.
"Orange County has got to get its head out of the sand and recognize that any default would create serious problems," Mr. Fong said in remarks before a conference sponsored by Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a trade publication. "This is a frustration that I have. It is still not clear that there is a message of conviction by Orange County's political leaders."
Currently, Orange County officials are seeking to "roll over" the $1.3 billion in borrowings that the county must repay in the next three months and possibly replace them with securities with longer maturities and lower returns. Some county officials have even suggested repudiating the debt entirely and are seeking legal ways to avoid meeting the county's debt obligations.
Mr. Fong said his "message" was that "rollovers should not be an option" sought by Orange County. "It's a question of accountability and responsibility," he said. "They are trying to disabuse themselves of any notion of accountability by saying 'the bankruptcy was not my fault and we don't want to pay for it.' "
Orange County, one of the nation's wealthiest counties, is also the home of widespread antitax sentiment. The unwillingness of the county to raise taxes and repay investors who lend the county money has angered holders of its short-term notes, primarily mutual funds, as well as the entire municipal finance industry.
The county's action threatens an underpinning of the industry: that the promise of a municipality to pay off its general obligation debt is ironclad.
Negotiations are now under way between the note holders and the county to reach some accommodation, which is expected by next week. The sides remain far apart; some close to the negotiations characterize the county's efforts as a "cramdown" that provides little for the note holders.
A June 27 ballot proposal will ask county residents to raise the county sales tax slightly to help pay off the debt -- but polls have indicated that even that modest proposal may be defeated.
Mr. Fong said that Orange County's stubbornness could hurt all California municipalities in the debt market. He predicted that short-term paper would cost the issuing municipalities a half to a full percentage point more in interest -- and that some less-affluent municipalities might find no lenders at all. Most municipalities need short-term borrowings to provide cash flow for municipal operations as they await the ebb and flow of tax receipts.
"It's already going to cost Los Angeles $25 million more to borrow short-term and that's money that could have gone for police or firemen," Mr. Fong said. "I hope the rest of the state can focus and see that this is going to become their problem, not just Orange County's problem."
Mr. Fong ruled out the possibility of any state bailout for Orange County. "Orange County made a mistake," Mr. Fong said. "Why should we bail them out?"
Orange County declared bankruptcy last December after a high-flying investment fund managed by the county collapsed, creating a $1.6 billion loss.
A state takeover of the county's financial affairs remains a slim possibility. Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed a bill proposing such a takeover last week, but Mr. Fong said that the State Legislature, still in an emergency session concerning Orange County, could pass such a measure -- and might do so if the county defaulted on its short-term securities and, in doing so, endangered the borrowings of other municipalities. "The problem with the bill Governor Wilson vetoed was not the bill itself, but that the timing was wrong," Mr. Fong said.
He also criticized Wall Street bankers who appeared to be willing to underwrite new Orange County securities, even as the county was seeking to default on its old ones.
"Investment bankers are smelling blood and are saying that there is life after bankruptcy," Mr. Fong said. "That causes me trouble. There may be life after bankruptcy. But is that fair for the other 2,000 municipalities in California that did nothing wrong but will get tarred and feathered for the poor management and lack of supervisory authority by Orange County?"

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Starting Over In Latin America;
Partnership Signals Revival Of Interest in Risky Market

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
It was hardly the typical leading indicator. But when Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski got into his red Porsche recently and headed south for Miami, that was as good a sign as any that the smart money was heading south, too, all the way back to Latin America.
Mr. Kuczynski, a trim 56-year-old investment banker, has been shifting his base to Miami for more than two years. Driving down in the Porsche with some of the last of his things, he was making a final break with his life up north, leaving behind a 33-year marriage and homes in New York and Washington. 
 Ahead was the new life he was forging with a woman he met some years ago, Nancy A. Lange, an analyst of institutional money managers. Also ahead was a bold plan to invest big again in Latin America. And since Mr. Kuczynski knows the region as well as anyone -- he was a pioneer there, "one of the only people doing Latin America 20 years ago," said Richard L. Grand-Jean, a former Salomon Brothers banker -- the move south can be read as something other than a midlife crisis.
Indeed, less than six months after Mexico's unexpected and drastic devaluation of the peso sent foreign investors skittering out of developing markets throughout the region, the dollars are starting to flow in again. And by relocating to Miami, an important pipeline for Latin-bound investment, Mr. Kuczynski (pronounced Ku-CHIN-ski) has been positioning himself to become one of the biggest conduits.
Now, Mr. Kuczynski has fully arrived. A former managing director at CS First Boston and a former Minister of Energy and Mines in Peru, where he grew up and remains a citizen, he has been signing the final papers this week to start up a $150 million fund that will take equity stakes in large privately held companies in Latin America.
The timing could not be better, he said, adding that the Latin American Enterprise Fund L. P. that he would be running with Ms. Lange and a few others was still attracting investors and could soon top $200 million.
"The Mexican crisis has increased the opportunities in the private equity market," he said, and "not only in Mexico," because it is now easier to win more favorable terms.
He's not the only one thinking that way. Nicholas F. Brady, the former Treasury Secretary, has teamed up with Daniel Marx, a former director of Argentina's central bank, to set up Darby Overseas Investments Ltd., which has already made some investments in Latin America. And Joseph G. Fogg 3d, a former head of investment banking at Morgan Stanley & Company, recently set up a private equity fund to invest in Peru.
Few who are making the return trip have Mr. Kuczynski's roots in the region -- his name derives from his father's Polish ancestry -- and his long years of investment experience there.
At CS First Boston, he helped privatize 18 Mexican banks, and he advised such companies as Vitro S.A., the Mexican glass maker, and YPF S.A., the Argentine energy company, about raising money on the New York Stock Exchange. He also helped George Soros, the billionaire fund manager, double his investment in a Peruvian brewery, Compania Nacional de Cerveza. Since leaving CS First Boston in 1992, he spent nearly three years restructuring and managing the Latin American portfolio of Stephan Schmidheiny, a Swiss tycoon. It was while doing that job that Mr. Kuczynski began to spend time in Miami.
That background -- complemented by Ms. Lange's extensive contacts with institutional investors -- has produced an enviable list of deep-pocket backers, including the Bank of America, a unit of the BankAmerica Corporation; the Chemical Banking Corporation; the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company, and Internationale Nederlanden Groep N. V., or ING, the new parent of Barings P.L.C.
"He's very effective, he knows the business well and he knows the markets," said Jay H. Newman, a former managing director at Morgan Stanley whose firm has made investments in Latin America.
And no one is starting over in quite as dramatic a fashion.
Earlier this month, the final divorce papers came through for Mr. Kuczynski and his wife of more than three decades, Jane Casey. The couple, who have three children, had long been a fixture of the social circuit in Washington, where Ms. Casey works as a journalist at Voice of America. Mr. Kuczynski would shuttle down weekends from his New York apartment to join her, often taking the opportunity to hobnob with politicians and top officials from agencies like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. He worked at both prior to moving to Wall Street in the mid-1970's.
These days, he is living in the Coconut Grove section of Miami with Ms. Lange.
The two met almost a decade ago when Ms. Lange worked for Institutional Investor magazine arranging conferences for money managers. Mr. Kuczynski said he told his wife in 1992 that he wanted a divorce because of his relationship with Ms. Lange, who is now 40 and has never been married.
The new couple live just blocks from the office on fashionable South Bayshore Drive where their Westfield Capital Management Company will run the Latin American Enterprise Fund and other investment operations. The Westfield team includes Mr. Kuczynski, Ms. Lange and five investment bankers: Fernando Montero, Edouardo Elejalde and Gerardo Sepulveda in Miami; Jairo Edouardo Loureiro in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Felipe de la Balze in Buenos Aires.
The company is "so lean, it's like an Indian fakir," Mr. Kuczynski said. There is nothing lean about the company's goals, however.
Mr. Kuczynski said he was looking for an annual return of 35 to 40 percent from buying and selling stakes in the right companies.
His fund will look to invest in companies with sales of at least $50 million a year. He estimated that 800 to 1,000 companies fell in the target group, but he was reluctant to identify any.
He would say, however, that beverage companies in Chile and Argentina are attractive. He was also looking at some basic steel and engineering businesses as well as newspapers and supermarket chains.
Of course, investing in Latin America is never a sure bet. The high returns that Mr. Kuczynski envisions are possible only because the area is such a risky proposition in the first place. Even some of the smartest investors with the best local connections were caught by surprise in such debacles as the regional debt crisis of the early 1980's and last December's peso devaluation. And the continuing recovery from that peso shock is certain to have its own surprises.
Still, foreign investors recently have started to become more confident about the region. After four months of decline, one sign is the net inflow of cash in March and April into mutual funds that invest in Latin American securities. Moreover, central bank reserves have started to rise again, said Ernest W. Brown, an economist at Morgan Stanley who follows Latin America. Mexico's reserves now stand at more than $8.3 billion, up from only $3.5 billion at the end of January.
The major Latin American stock markets have also recovered strongly since the beginning of the year. The Mexican stock market index, for example, closed yesterday at 2,014.76, compared with a low for the year of 1,447.52 at the end of February.
The slump in Latin American securities in January and February was probably overdone, experts now say. "There's no market that overshoots like the less-developed country market," said Mr. Newman, the former Morgan Stanley managing director. "The smart money believes that in the long term there's incredible value in Latin America."
American corporate investors seem to have gotten the message. Auto companies, telephone companies, airlines and state pension funds have all been buying Latin American debt and equity in recent weeks, said Stephen W. Dizard, a managing director at Salomon Brothers who specializes in emerging markets.
Why are some placing money with Mr. Kuczynski and his team?
Mr. Kuczynski "checks out very well," said Jeffrey C. Walker at Chemical Venture Partners, a unit of Chemical Banking. "Montero checks out very strongly. And Felipe de la Balze is one of the real stars in Buenos Aires."
The Chemical group decided to put $25 million into Mr. Kuczynski's fund, and hopes to get returns of "30 percent pretax per year and higher," Mr. Walker said. One attraction was that Mr. Kuczynski's fund covers all of Latin America, not just one country, making it less exposed to volatility, he added.
Former colleagues at First Boston generally speak well of Mr. Kuczynski, praising his marketing skills and high-level contacts. If they have criticisms, they are that he was more independent than most of his colleagues, that he may be a little vain and that he is generally better at marketing than at managing, but that he usually has found skilled associates to manage the business he brings in.
Raising money for his new venture -- a process that started in earnest early last year and had to weather Mexico's devaluation -- was not easy. "It was like having cancer," Mr. Kuczynski said. "You have a good couple of days and then you are set back for a day or two."
Ms. Lange was helpful in producing the good days. "The management team wasn't used to raising money," she said. "They thought it would go faster than it did, but I knew it wouldn't. I decided that I would call on banks and insurance companies first. They'd be more likely to give you a quick decision than a pension fund."
Now that the fund is almost up and running and he has settled into his new home base, Mr. Kuczynski said he was thrilled to be closer to Latin America. "To Chile, Argentina and Peru," he said, "New York is just too damn far."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
For many luxury auto makers and their agencies, the U.S.-Japan tariff battle is off limits.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
IMAGINE if for some reason the Federal Government imposed a tax on soft drinks sold in contoured bottles. How many minutes would Pepsi-Cola wait before unleashing an ad blitz intended to exploit its sudden advantage over Coca-Cola?
Automobiles, it seems, aren't quite like soda. Except for Cadillac, most marketers of luxury cars and their agencies say they are unlikely to undertake advertising or marketing efforts to benefit from the threat by the Clinton Administration to impose a 100 percent tariff on models of competitive Japanese marques like Lexus, Infiniti and Acura. 
 "We're not interested in any artificial advantage these tariffs might create," said Donna Boland, a spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz of North America in Montvale, N.J., part of Daimler-Benz A.G.
Robert C. Austin, marketing communications director for Volvo Cars of North America in Rockleigh, N.J., a unit of Volvo A.B., said, "We are not planning any guerrilla tactics to take advantage of the situation."
And Kathleen Hamilton, manager for North American communications at the Jaguar Cars unit of the Ford Motor Company in Mahwah, N.J., said, "We don't have plans to exploit this in any sense of the word."
The auto marketers and their agencies offer a variety of reasons for their reticence, which may in part stem from the volatility of the situation and the chance that one or both sides in the touchy trade dispute will blink.
"I don't want to touch it," said Patrick R. Fallon, chairman of Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis, referring to the tariff issue. "It's not in our best interest."
"We might be jumping for joy in the short term," added Mr. Fallon, whose agency was awarded the creative part of the account of BMW of North America, part of BMW A.G., in late March. "But anything that interferes with the free market is, in the long term, bad for us."
Lawrence W. Gustin, a spokesman for the Buick division of the General Motors Corporation in Flint, Mich., offered a similar rationale. "We're in favor of open trade," he said.
In the relatively low-key and genteel realm of selling higher-priced cars, seizing on the misfortune of someone else might be, well, tacky.
"It's not particularly our style," said Barrie K. Hedge, president of Angotti, Thomas, Hedge in New York, one of two agencies working for Saab Cars USA, a unit of the Swedish auto maker Saab Automobile A.B.
"Our audience is pretty sophisticated," he added, referring to the buyers of higher-priced nameplates. "I'm not sure they're people who are terribly fond of" such tactics.
In addition, Mr. Hedge said, the potential buyers of Saabs are knowledgeable enough to realize "what a good value we are," regardless of whether competitors like the Toyota Motor Corporation, the Nissan Motor Company and the Honda Motor Company are forced to sell their luxury brands at far higher prices than now. (At the moment, however, the Japanese car makers say they will not pass on the higher tariff to their customers.)
"Do we need to prime the pump?" Mr. Hedge asked. "I think it would happen automatically."
That thought was echoed by Ms. Hamilton at Jaguar. "Right now, in terms of our advertising, the luxury value-price equation is working well for us," she said, citing an increase in sales in the American market of 31.7 percent for the first four months of 1995, compared with the corresponding period a year ago.
Mr. Austin at Volvo said: "The most important thing for us to do is get Volvo on the shopping lists of more people, and our campaign we feel is doing that because business is going rather well for us. So we don't want to detract from that." For the first four months of this year, Volvo sales in the United States rose 7.2 percent, compared with the corresponding period in 1994.
Robert C. Doherty, chairman and chief executive of McKinney & Silver in Raleigh, N.C., the agency for Audi of America, borrowed a term from political strategists to describe his intentions to continue emphasizing the themes now prevalent in the Audi campaign.
"You can anticipate no such advertising from Audi" centered on the tariff, he said, "because that would be 'off message.' " McKinney & Silver ads aggressively compare models of Audi, a unit of Volkswagen A.G., to imports like Volvo.
The exception to this trend is the Cadillac division of General Motors. "Even if the sanctions don't go through, this serves to highlight the critical situation relative to our trade imbalance with the Japanese," said Peter Levin, advertising director for Cadillac in Warren, Mich., "and should make the educated, sophisticated luxury-car buyer think twice about American alternatives."
"We see pretty significant opportunity, particularly for the Seville STS," he added, referring to a Cadillac model that costs about $48,000, "as it becomes more and more of a value" relative to tariff-taxed Japanese rivals.
Mr. Levin took issue with the belief that if the tariff took effect, shoppers suffering from sticker shock over Japanese imports would automatically gravitate to European imports and ignore American-built products. He cited research showing that "Seville and Seville STS are getting pretty high consideration levels and are starting to 'conquest' more and more."

Harold M. Jacobs, a former chairman of New York City's Board of Higher Education and a past president of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan.
He was 81 and lived in Lawrence, L.I.
A successful Brooklyn businessman, Mr. Jabobs held two distinct leadership roles, civic and religious, serving for more than two decades as a member and chairman of the Board of Higher Education and as a spokesman for Jewish orthodoxy in this country.
His final years on the board were marked by the controversy over the board's attempt to fire Dr. Leonard Jeffries as chairman of the black studies department at City College.
Mr. Jacobs was one of four board members who spoke out against Dr. Jeffries and actively sought his ouster because of the professor's anti-Semitic comments. As a result, Mr. Jacobs was one of four board members who were assessed $80,000 in damages in 1994 in a suit filed against the board by Dr. Jeffries in Federal Court in Manhattan. But a Federal appeals court in Manhattan reversed the ruling last month, holding that City College acted within its rights in removing Dr. Jeffries as chairman.
Mr. Jacobs was a lifelong friend of former Mayor Abraham D. Beame, who appointed him to the Board of Higher Education in 1974. Mr. Jacobs was named chairman two years later.
Mr. Jacobs was a strong advocate of charging tuition at the City University of New York, which began in 1975. He also advocated tough financial reforms during the city's fiscal crisis in 1976, and warned he would seek the resignation of the university's Chancellor, Robert J. Kibbee, unless they were implemented.
As head of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, he advocated a strong, pro-Israel American policy in the Middle East and a tight arms embargo against Israel's Arab neighbors.
The son of a prosperous manufacturer, Mr. Jacobs grew up in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, where he became active in Orthodox Jewish affairs.
Despite his family's wealth, he chose to work his way through college, attending St. John's University at night. His strong sense of self-reliance helped explain his support of tuition in the City University.
"Anyone who wants to go to college badly enough will find a way," he said in 1976. Mr. Jacobs received a master's degree in economics from Columbia University.
Mr. Jacobs built his own business, Precision Ware, into a profitable kitchenware company. He later headed Precision Equities, an investment company.
Mr. Jacobs also served as president of the National Council of Young Israel and as a member of New York State's advisory council for the Small Business Administration.
Mr. Jacobs's wife, Pearl, died last year. He is survived by two sons, Joseph, of Brooklyn, and Paul, of Toronto; a daughter, Vivian Chill of Manhattan, and a sister, Ruth Malinowitz of Queens.

3 of Japan's Top Securities Firms Post Big Losses

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 18

 BODY:
Battered by Japan's prolonged stock market slump, three of the nation's four biggest securities firms today reported combined losses equivalent to more than $1 billion for the latest fiscal year, while the fourth, the NomuraSecurities Company, announced a sharp decline in profit.
Nomura, Japan's biggest brokerage firm, said pretax profit tumbled 87 percent in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, to 6.80 billion yen ($76 million at the exchange rate of 89 yen to the dollar on March 31) from 50.69 billion yen in the prior fiscal year. 
 The Daiwa Securities Company said it swung to a pretax loss of 24.90 billion yen from a profit of 52.03 billion yen in the previous year. The Yamaichi Securities Company reported a loss of 50.6 billion yen in contrast to a profit of 17.87 billion yen, and the Nikko Securities Company showed a loss of 19.25 billion yen from a profit of 35.02 billion yen.
The firms' results were for the parent companies only; they will report group results later. Also today, all of Japan's nine second-tier brokerage firms reported parent-company losses for the fiscal year.
The brokerage houses were hurt by low volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which is slumping because of Japan's weak economy and sluggish corporate profits.
"We suffered from steep declines in commission income, in particular on stockbroking," said Nomura's managing director, Atsushi Saito. "We don't expect our revenue will drastically improve in the near future. Unless we take drastic steps, we may be overwhelmed by Western houses advancing into Japan and Japanese banks' securities subsidiaries."
 Analysts said financially weak brokerage houses would be forced to seek outside capital or close down. "But like Nomura, strong houses will become much stronger," an analyst at a domestic research institute said.
 Mr. Saito said: "The current conditions are the same as what happened in the United States in the 1970's, and we must diversify our strategy toward income sources. We see China and other Asian countries as a major source of future income."
Last month, Mr. Saito said, Nomura was profitable because of its bond business, even though average daily volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was only about 210 billion yen from the start of April through mid-May. Nomura views daily turnover of 250 billion yen as a break-even level. During the full fiscal year, volume averaged 330 billion yen a day, below the four firms' forecast of 400 billion yen.
 The three big firms that reported losses, Daiwa, Yamaichi and Nikko, said they expected to return to profitability in the current fiscal year.

HEADLINE: 4-Week Average of Jobless Claims Is Up

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment benefits dipped slightly last week, but the more important four-week average shot up to the highest level in nearly a year, the Government said today.
New claims for unemployment pay decreased by 2,000, to 364,000, in the week that ended last Saturday, the Labor Department said. The weekly total exceeded Wall Street economists' forecasts of 361,000 initial claims. 
 The closely watched four-week moving average, which is considered a more accurate barometer of the labor market than the weekly figure because it irons out weekly fluctuations, climbed to 363,000 last week, the highest since 365,500 in the week that ended on May 28, 1994.

HEADLINE: Britannica Didn't Care Enough About Sales

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Slow-to-Adapt Encyclopaedia Britannica for Sale" (Business Day, May 16): At $1,500, is the price of the printed Britannica really so high? Each page has about 1,300 words, versus about 350 for a normal book. At 1,100 pages, each volume contains nearly a million-and-a-half words. Should the vast and indefinitely useful Britannica charge the market price for the nearly 600 scholarly books it represents -- $30,000? 
 I know a small-town newspaper editor who recently replaced her 1950's Britannica. She remarked that if the 1955 price had merely kept pace with inflation, it would have been several thousand dollars more.
You have to spend money to make money, and I fear the Britannica has been very phlegmatic on the sales side. It is not for sale in shops.
Two months ago I saw a small notice in a computer magazine about the Britannica CD. I called the number listed, and was informed that I couldn't buy the product except from a local sales office in New York, whose number was then provided.
The woman at the New York office never offered to take an order for her product. After a long discussion about whether I represented a business, educational or governmental entity, she promised to send "the information." It never arrived. If lazy management causes our cultural institutions to collapse, it must be seen as the enemy, not the marker, of civilization.

Mix of Cultures, Politics and Bravado

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
Major exhibitions of contemporary African art are rare in New York City. The last one of note was the 1993 "Fusion: West African Artists at the Venice Biennale," a fascinating, tough-to-love show organized by the Museum for African Art for Europe and brought to SoHo last year.
Of its five artists, the outstanding presence was a 38-year-old painter who goes by the name Ouattara (pronounced wah-TARA). His big assemblages of paint, dirt and found objects, pierced with niches and crowned with architectural turrets, had the texture of mud-walled shrines, but their vibrant combination of graffitilike words and gestural abstraction recalled epic-minded Western pasticheurs like Anselm Kiefer and Julian Schnabel. 
 The artist is now having his first solo show with Gagosian Gallery, and it's a knockout. The new paintings are almost absurdly ambitious: grand in scale (13 feet across in some cases), broadly but confidently painted and packed with a dense pileup range of images in which African history and American rap music, voodoo and Joseph Beuys's shamanism, colonialist remnants and Pan African politics maintain an exhilarating coexistence.
This mix is entirely in line with Ouattara's own background. He was born in the Ivory Coast, and although by his own account his childhood was shaped by such traditional events as initiation rituals. An uncle, Draman Ouattara, was, for a time, the Ivorian Prime Minister and later an executive director for the World Bank in the United States. Ouattara himself left Africa for Paris to pursue his career as an artist. There he met the American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, who not only bought his work in bulk, but also brought him to New York, where he now spends much of his time, while commuting to Paris and Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
American, European and African cultures mingle seamlessly in the new work, though from first to last it is Africa that predominates. The first painting in the show, the mural-size "Nkrouma Berlin 1885," is a vivid symbolic precis of the continent's modern history, beginning in 1885, when European powers gathered in Berlin to carve Africa up into the disruptive and arbitrary proprietary units still in place today.
Against the form of a vermilion cross stand two dark tutelary figures, one with bound arms, the other with hands raised in prayer. Between them, written in the Amharic language of Ethiopia, is the name of Kwame Nkrouma of Ghana, who was both President of Africa's first independent nation and who urged Pan African unity. Finally, at the painting's very center is a scrap of paper bearing the name of European cigarettes, a wry souvenir of the discarded but ever-present colonialist past.
Political references are still more pointed elsewhere. One painting makes allusions to the existence of contemporary slavery. A grotesque, headless, coffee-colored figure, derived from the artist's reading of the biblical apocalypse, seems to be in the process of exploding across a lemon-yellow ground. Legions of olive- and black-skinned figures -- a generic third world labor force -- stand in ranks around him, while a torn burlap bag used for exporting "naturally decaffeinated" coffee is glued to the upper left corner.
Like the work of Beuys, Ouattara's is framed in epochal and universalist socio-spiritual terms. It is an approach generally out of fashion in New York's mainstream art at present, but he makes a vividly convincing case for it in paintings like "Mami Wata," which brings together the Afro-Caribbean deity with a Christian cross and voodoo instruments in a symmetrical composition that actually suggests a ritual enactment in progress but manages to sustain an unpretentious, street-smart pop edge.
Popular culture itself is the subject of "Hip-Hop Jazz Makoussa," with its two horizontal bands of collaged record album covers, echoed by attenuated male and female African figures. Here Aretha Franklin and Bob Marley, John Coltrane and the Rolling Stones, Queen Latifah and African bands form an edge-to-edge continuum, which has African culture at its roots and which is "blessed," to quote the Amharic word on the painting's surface.
The distinctive blend of wit and gravity in the Gagosian show, which has been organized by Raymond Foye, is most arrestingly embodied in "Dark Star." Here the figure of death appears in the form of a gold skeleton, posed with the hip-slung insouciance of a rock hero as he pounds out rhythms on a drum. A skull fused with an ahnk, the Egyptian symbol of eternal life, appears elsewhere. The rest of the huge canvas is filled with circling blood-red footprints, left by the artist as he danced across its surface, and a sea of handprints like a communal gesture of either praise or dismay.
The sense of community -- of a kind of spiritual force field shared across cultures -- is strong here, as it was, in a crankier, angrier, specifically urban way in Basquiat's work. And indeed it is easy to see why the American artist championed his African colleague. In some ways they are mirror reflections: the black American artist channeling African influences and making them his own, the African channeling American influences and making them his own. The resemblance between the two ends there -- the work of one could never be mistaken for the other -- but the connection suggests vibrant future directions for contemporary art on both sides of the Atlantic.
The works of Ouattara remain at the Gagosian Gallery, 65 Thompson Street, SoHo, through June 10.

Madonna Pitches In for High Art
Madonna and the Philadelphia Museum of Art might at first seem like strange bedfellows. But think about it. The rock star is a collector of 20th-century Mexican paintings and photographs, as well as a supporter of the arts. And the Philadelphia Museum, like all arts institutions, needs support for its special exhibitions.
So when Anne d'Harnoncourt, the museum's director, learned that Madonna was an admirer of the photographer Tina Modotti, she approached her to see if she would be interested in supporting a major Modotti exhibition scheduled to open in Philadelphia on Sept. 16. "We proposed and she accepted," Ms. d'Harnoncourt said. 
 But Madonna has a more creative notion of beneficence than simply writing a check. On June 10, Sotheby's in New York will auction her 1969 white convertible Mercedes 280 SE, the one she drove in her 1994 music video "Deeper and Deeper." It is expected to sell for $40,000 to $60,000, with proceeds going to the exhibition.
In the past, Madonna has donated items to charity auctions, but often the buyers would turn around and sell them at auction, making a substantial profit by using her name as the bait. "Now she would rather sell something directly than see it marked up 10 times and have the profits go to an individual," said her press agent, Liz Rosenberg. About Madonna's choice of an exhibition to finance, Ms. Rosenberg said it shouldn't be seen as unusual: "Madonna's always been a Modotti fan."
Ms. d'Harnoncourt said she hoped the car would "go through the roof," especially since the museum needs more than $125,000 for the show. She also said the show might attract an interesting crowd because of Madonna's involvement. "It certainly gives the show an extra spin, an added element of intrigue," she said. "But people may be surprised that Modotti is not as highly contemporary as Madonna is."
 
Expansion at the Cooper-Hewitt
 The Cooper-Hewitt, the National Design Museum that is part of the Washington-based Smithsonian Institution, has an ambitious agenda. It is about to embark on a $20 million renovation that will force the museum to close for a year, beginning on Aug. 21.
This will be the first time the institution has expanded its home in the Andrew Carnegie mansion on Fifth Avenue and 91st Street. The building was renovated into a museum in 1976, when the Cooper-Hewitt moved uptown from the Cooper Union.
"This is a major turning point for us," said Dianne H. Pilgrim, the Cooper-Hewitt's director. "Two and a half years ago, we hired Polshek & Partners to do the design."
Besides an upgraded climate control system and more efficient study and storage areas, which will better preserve the 250,000 objects in the Cooper-Hewitt's collection, more of the museum will be open to the public. The building will also be totally accessible to the disabled.
A new design research and resource center is also a major part of the scheme. It will be housed in two adjacent brownstones, 9 and 11 East 90th Street, which the museum owns. The two buildings will be linked internally and connected to the Carnegie mansion. Financing is a joint effort. The Smithsonian has provided $13 million, and the museum has raised almost $3 million privately. "We need to raise $4 million more," Mrs. Pilgrim said.
Though the museum will close its exhibitions, it will still offer its educational programs and workshops in its main building, and the library and curatorial departments will remain open.
That's not to say the Cooper-Hewitt has curtailed its curatorial efforts. The museum plans a number of off-site exhibitions during the renovations, among them "Six Bridges and the Making of the New York Megalopolis," scheduled to open in January at the Paine Webber Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street.
 
Bold Sculptures for the White House
 The First Lady's Garden at the White House has a new look. Instead of being dominated by demure spring flower beds, it is filled with bold sculptures by such artists as David Smith and Mark di Suvero, Beverly Pepper and David Deming.
The setting is the second in a four-part series called "20th-Century American Sculpture at the White House," organized by the Committee for the Preservation of the White House and the Association of Art Museum Directors. When conceiving the series, J. Carter Brown, the director emeritus of the National Gallery of Art in Washington and head of a sculpture subcommittee, said the panel had decided to divide the series into four geographic areas: Midwest, West, South and Northeast. The first exhibition in the series, "Statues Into Sculpture," which was on view for five months beginning in October, was organized by George W. Neubert, director of the Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery and Sculpture Garden at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. It represented only Midwestern artists.
The new exhibition was organized by Townsend Wolfe, director and chief curator of the Arkansas Arts Center in Little Rock, and consists of 12 sculptures from museums in the Southeast. All the works were created since 1965. The first part "dealt with the development of sculpture from the turn of the century to the present," Mr. Wolfe said in a telephone interview this week. "This show deals with more contemporary artists."
 
Record Prices for Latin Artists

 Economic problems in Latin America don't seem to have hurt the market for Latin American art. On Wednesday, at a Sotheby's sale of Latin American paintings, drawings and sculpture, 11 artists made record prices. Ten works from the I.B.M. collection were included in the auction, and they were the stars of the evening. Frida Kahlo's 1942 "Self-Portrait With Monkey and Parrot" sold for $3.1 million, the highest-priced painting in the sale and a record price for the artist. The buyer was Eduardo Costantini, a financier from Buenos Aires. Another record was made for Diego Rivera's "Dance in Tehuantepec," which was bought by an unidentified pricate collector for $3 million.
"Ten years ago buyers tended to be nationalistic," said August Uribe, who heads Sotheby's department of Latin American art. "We are now seeing an internationalization in the market."

HEADLINE: Iran's Nuclear Goals Lie in Half-Built Plant

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: BUSHEHR, Iran, May 16

 BODY:
At a vast construction site baked by the sun and buffeted by the salty Persian Gulf air, two partly built nuclear reactors are frozen in time.
For the Iranians, the enormous steel and concrete structures represent what might have been and what might be, a symbol of their legal right to develop nuclear energy and of their potential to become a great regional power. 
 For the Americans, the reactors are an ominous sign of Iran's determination to build nuclear nergy Agency have never reported suspicious activity.
But the plant has strained Washington's relationship with Moscow, aggravated already inimical relations between the United States and Iran and trained the spotlight on a place that has yet to produce either a gram of enriched uranium or a watt of electricity.
The United States and Germany say they have amassed substantial evidence that Iran is secretly buying components and technology from abroad that point to a determined weapons program. The American view is that the Bushehr project is dangerous because it will bring hundreds, perhaps thousands of Russian experts to Iran who could help build nuclear bombs.
Despite the insistence of Iran's leaders that they have no intention of becoming a nuclear power, they have invited few outsiders to Bushehr, and in opening up the complex to a foreign reporter, they clearly intended to prove they have nothing to hide.
"We only want to get the benefit of the huge amount of money we have already spent," Reza Amrollahi, the head of Iran's nuclear program, said in an interview in Teheran. "We have the right, just like any other country, to develop a peaceful nuclear energy program."
Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi once said Iran would have nuclear weapons "without a doubt and sooner than one would think," and it was he who asked Siemens of Germany in the 1970's to build a nuclear energy complex for his country.
The revolutionaries who toppled the Shah in 1979 vowed, as they put it, not to waste the people's money on such a frivolous project, and they canceled the contract. Then, several years later, they changed their minds and decided to make good on the Shah's $6 billion investment.
But the German Government, suspicious of Iran's intentions and under intense American pressure, determined to avoid all nuclear cooperation with Iran. Then the Russians came along this past January with an irresistible bargain: they would build and install a light-water reactor in one structure for only $780 million, and finish the second one if the first went well.
"Because of the bad economic situation in Russia, the Russians can do industrial and technical magic here," said Kazem Khabir, the deputy manager of the site and a nuclear engineer who received his master's degree from the University of Oklahoma. "For such a small price, I don't think the West could have done such a thing."
The site has been largely untouched in the 16 years since the Shah was overthrown.
Although soldiers guard the entrance and at least one antiaircraft gun is on the site, the entire complex can easily be seen from the villages and farms nearby.
With 2,000 housing units, subsidized food shop, hospital, barber shop, elementary school, bakery, bank, laundry, swimming pools, playground, movie theater and vast dining halls capable of serving 4,000 people, the thousand-acre complex resembles a small Government-run village, not a sophisticated secret cell for learning how to build bombs.
Over the years, the authorities have tried to preserve the site exactly as it was at the time of the Shah. They have covered motor shafts and rotary blades with tar-based paint to lessen the corrosive affects of the humid salty air. Visitors are required to remove their shoes at the entrance to a sophisticated information center, to prevent salt from damaging the carpets.
German-made models of planned reactors are so detailed that they include all the auxiliary buildings, complete with vehicles, palm trees and even tiny workers dressed in white uniforms and caps. Electronic information boards explain how a thermal power plant operates.
Since the 1979 revolution, the complex has been home to 300 to 400 Iranians who maintain it, and it now houses an estimated 150 Russian engineers and inspectors who have arrived in recent months. The Iranians say 500 Russians will eventually be based on the site; the Russians say they will send 3,000.
Exactly where the Russians are is not clear; there were none to be seen. The ranking Russian official at the site declined a request for an interview, and the Russians have not allowed even official Iranian guests to photograph Russians at the site.
The Russians are said to live in a separate area and report to their own director. They have already imported their own cook, and will open their own primary school next year. People in Bushehr, about 15 miles away, say Russians come by bus and do their shopping every Thursday.
"They are scattered all around," Mr. Khabir explained. "Maybe there are two underneath us, two on top."
Some Russians have had problems adjusting to the rules of an Islamic republic. The few who have been found with women or alcohol have been sent home, according to officials at the complex. Russian women in bathing suits have tried -- without success -- to sneak into the Persian Gulf for a swim.
By all accounts the Russians have an extraordinary job ahead of them.
Iraqi war planes hit the site at least twice in the latter stages of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980's, damaging one reactor so badly that the structure has been sealed and its protective dome of steel and concrete covered over with sheet metal.
The Germans withheld key blueprints and technical documents relating to the site. That will make it more difficult to fit 1,000-megawatt Russian-made reactors and turbines into a damaged structure intended for German-designed 1,200-megawatt reactors. If the Bushehr site causes anxiety ourside Iran, it may have little to do with the possible spread of bomb-making know-how and more to do with the issue of nuclear safety.
Already there are conflicting analyses of what structures Russia will be able to salvage. Iranian officials insist the metal dome and the partly completed concrete dome that surrounds it can be salvaged. Some Russian officials say the work may be much more extensive.
Sergei Tretyakov, Russia's Ambassador to Iran, said in an interview that Russia would have to lay a new foundation for the reactor; Mr. Khabir said he believed that the existing foundation was sound.
The Russians also question whether Iran, with its worsening economy, will be able to pay for the project.
"It's a cash deal, a commercial deal, and they'll have to pay in installments in advance," Mr. Tretyakov said. "If they pay, we will go on; if they don't, we'll stop."
The main work is yet to get started. During the Government-arranged visit, fewer than 50 Iranian workers could be seen, welding metal, moving equipment, bringing in electricity and serving meals and tea. Huge cranes on the top of the reactor stood idle.
"It's a monument," said one Iranian official connected with the nuclear energy program. "You visited a monument, a dead monument."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 20, 1995, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Iran's nuclear energy program included a scrambled passage in some copies. It should have read: "For the Americans, the reactors are an ominous sign of Iran's determination to build nuclear weapons within the next decade, and a threat to American national security. There is no evidence that this site, 730 miles south of Teheran, is a center for a weapons program, and inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency have never reported suspicious activity."

HEADLINE: Japanese-American Judges Reflect on Internment

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 18

 BODY:
The places themselves Tule Lake and Manzanar, Calif.; Minidoka, Idaho; Topaz, Utah -- have largely returned to dust. But for five Japanese-American judges, the internment camps of World War II still loom large, either because they claimed chunks of their childhoods or because, even for those too young to have been in them, they cast a long and gloomy shadow over their lives.
Last week, before an audience that included many others who had been interned, the five judges reflected on the relocation of 120,000 Japanese-Americans, two-thirds of them United States citizens, during the war and its effect on them and their offspring. And because one of those descendants is the judge presiding over the O. J. Simpson trial, the epoch moved from the footnotes to the footlights. 
 As seven television cameras recorded the scene, Judge Lance Allan Ito explained how his very name is a monument to the internment experience.
His parents, who met at a camp in Heart Mountain, Wyo., had named him Lance for the San Francisco lawyer who had unsuccessfully sued the Federal Government for what his parents lost during their three years of incarceration. It was an honor that came, in a sense, in lieu of a fee. Allan was for the pastor of the Mount Hollywood Congregational Church, who took care of his parents' homes while they languished 1,400 miles away.
Judge Ito was born in 1950, four years after the last of the 10 camps closed. But three other panelists at the gathering sponsored by the Japanese-American National Museum and the Los Angeles Jewish Federation were interned for three years of their youth. They recalled the indignities, like sleeping on mattresses they had stuffed with straw, or sharing toilets with hundreds of others, or covering knotholes in the flimsy wooden barracks walls with tin cans to keep out the dust.
They talked as well about the paradoxes of the relocation: being removed days after selling war bonds; being taught behind barbed wire about the glories of freedom; watching newly minted Gold Star mothers cry in captivity for their soldier sons who had served in the United States Army, and had died in battle.
The three who were interned reflected on how the years spent under watchtowers and searchlights had guided them toward the law and guide them still on the bench, sensitizing them to civil liberties and the rights of minorities.
"It has certainly affected me 26 hours a day," said Judge Robert M. Takasugi of Federal District Court in Los Angeles, calling his internment "an education to be fair."
Judge A. Wallace Tashima, also of the Federal District Court, concurred. "I'm still keenly aware that the Government can make mistakes, and probably more conscious than I otherwise would have been of the persecution of minorities," Judge Tashima said in an interview. He is soon to become the first American of Japanese ancestry to sit on the United States Court of Appeals.
For all the reminiscences, the speakers at the gathering here warned that anti-immigrant hysteria, particularly in economically hard-pressed California, was not some historic artifact; nor was anti-Japanese prejudice. Though unable -- or unwilling -- to summon his name, Judge Takasugi spoke caustically of the stereotypic sing-song impersonation of Judge Ito by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, in a recent radio interview, calling it "a disgrace."
At the same time, last week's event at the museum demonstrated how far Japanese-Americans have come since February 1942, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, setting in motion the mass removal of people of Japanese ancestry. "If the five of us had been sitting as public officials in 1942, it's hard to conceive that we would have been forcibly removed from the state of California," said Judge Tashima, a California native who was interned in Poston, Ariz.
The evening also furnished a chance to see the newest new Judge Ito. As the Simpson trial drones on, the only emotion the new Judge Ito has come to show is annoyance. Here, as he recounted his maternal grandfather's suicide, a grandmother's citizenship ceremony, his two visits to Dachau, his voice cracked and his composure vanished.
In arranging the evening, the Los Angeles Jewish Federation attempted the delicate and sometimes thankless task of showing that while no wartime experience could compare with the Holocaust, no group had a monopoly on suffering. .
The Japanese-American National Museum is in the city's Little Tokyo section, close to -- in Los Angeles that means only a short drive from -- Judge Ito's courtroom. The program included a reception, in which Jews and Japanese-Americans shared kosher sushi and California rolls near an exhibition on the liberation of Dachau and a computer terminal where a sign stated: "Find Your War Relocation Records Here. Limit requests to 4 Per Family."
At the internment camps, apart from the heat and the cold, the rattlesnakes, the scorpions and the mud, the barracks so indistinguishable that youngsters sometimes got lost on their way "home" from the latrines, life was not always painful, at least for children. With hundreds of contemporaries in close proximity, they lacked neither for playmates nor activities: the Heart Mountain camp, for instance, had seven Boy Scout troops. (When the future Representative Norman Y. Mineta of California was allowed to leave the internment camp for a jamboree, his tent mate there was the future Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming.)
Nor, in a place where everyone ate in the same mess halls and lived in the same rude rectangles, were its legacies all deleterious. "It was a great leveler of class distinctions," Judge Tashima recalled, "and for someone like myself, coming from a poor background, it was probably advantageous."
But for older Japanese-Americans, who lost their homes, their property and their dignity, the experience was painful. Judge Takasugi's father, 57, died of a stroke brought on, his son believes, by feelings of helplessness at Tule Lake.
Judge Ito described how his maternal grandfather, an insurance salesman before the war, could not reclaim his job, declared bankruptcy and eventually killed himself.
Judge Fumiko Hachiya Wasserman of Los Angeles County Superior Court recalled the shame her father felt among his relatives for the humiliation of internment.
Only years later did Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki, also of Los Angeles County Superior Court, learn that his father had grown so despondent during the ordeal that he considered returning to Japan. It has taken Judge Fujisaki, who was 5 when he was interned at Manzanar, most of his life to shed the feeling that he had deserved to be there.
"I always felt that somehow or another I had something to apologize for," Judge Fujisaki said.
Less than two hours after millions of television viewers had watched him fine two lawyers in the Simpson case, Judge Ito stood alone with his thoughts in the museum's exhibition room, watching archival footage of people boarding Pacific Greyhound buses for the camps, or playing baseball under big, dry Western skies. He then walked across the street, where a shabby tar-paper barracks from Heart Mountain had been reconstructed. Six families had lived in it -- one, conceivably, his own.
Judge Takasugi, who stood nearby, was asked whether it resembled where he had lived. "Yeah, exactly," he replied, "but the floors were tar, so on a hot day we started sinking."
A photographer asked him if he was willing to step inside. "I don't want to go back in, really," Judge Takasugi said. "I'll take the loyalty oath."
Throughout the evening, everyone labored to make things easy for Judge Ito. Though there were frequent references to the Simpson case, all were gentle and affectionate. In an allusion to recent DNA testimony, the evening's moderator, Laurie Levenson of Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, called him "a man who is 1 in 9.7 million."
When Judge Ito's turn to speak came, he initially adopted the same clinical, understated tone in which he usually presides over People v. Simpson. He called the topic under discussion "the relocation experience," much as he calls the trial of the century "the Simpson matter."
But he spoke so quietly that the program's organizer, Heather Rothman of the Jewish federation, stood up and gestured for him to raise his voice. And when he started describing the ceremony in which his grandmother became a United States citizen, his lips twitched and his voice fell out of gear.
He faltered again when he spoke of a childhood visit with his parents in the 1960's to Dachau, which he called "one of the most profoundly moving experiences of my life," and described how he returned to that German camp last year with his wife, Margaret York.
"I told her it was very important," he said. "And I have to tell you, I agree that if it can happen to us, if it can happen to you, it can happen to anybody."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Are Down, But Investor Influx Cuts Loss

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday, hurt in part by profit taking after its recent rally. But a steep selloff in the stock market helped limit losses as investors fled equities for the relative safety of Treasury bills.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 14/32 , to 1096/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.89 percent from 6.86 percent. 
 The decline in the bond market began after a Government report showed surprising strength in imports and exports, suggesting that economic growth is moving at a faster pace than most people had expected.
The Commerce Department data reported that the overall shortfall between exports and imports fell fractionally to $9.12 billion in March from a revised $9.15 billion in February.
 Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said, "Stronger exports could put some further price pressures on the manufacturing sector, while stronger imports raise the possibility that the consumer may come back strong during the second half of the year."
In another report released yesterday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its index of regional business activity increased only slightly, to minus 16.4 this month from minus 16.7 in April The prices-paid subcomponent fell slightly to 28.3 from 31.7, registering the fourth consecutive monthly decline, while the prices received rose to 5.7 from 2.8, still at a relatively low level.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said while the market did take note of the Philadelphia Fed index as well as the trade data, market participants did little more than yawn given that the reports were close to expectations. "The major event taking place over the next few trading sessions, of course, will be the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday," Mr. Fine said. " But since the Fed is expected to keep its monetary policy unchanged, the major question facing everbody that day may well be, 'What's for lunch?' "
"The economy is presently not strong enough to produce an inflation threat and cause the Fed to tighten, while at the same time the current softness seen in some sectors may well prove temporary, which makes the concept of Fed easing seem very premature."
The bond market was helped yesterday by the biggest selloff in the stock market this year. Investors fleeing stocks typically turn to the relative safety of Treasury bills, which helps support the long end of the market as well.
Next week the Treasury will sell $29.25 billion of two- and five-year notes. In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 6.15 percent and the five-year notes were offered at a price to yield 6.40 percent, up two and three basis points, respectively, from the previous day.
In the corporate market, Viacom Inc. joined a number of borrowers that have brought to market more than $16 billion of new debt in the last month.
Yesterday Viacom sold $1 billion of 10-year noncallable junk notes with a 7 3/4 percent coupon at a price of 99.04, to yield 7.89 percent, or about 130 basis points more than the 10-year Treasury note. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The company drew off a $3 billion shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Standard & Poor's rates Viacom's senior debt BB+, and Moody's Investors Service rates it Ba2. Analysts said the low yield at pricing was more akin to high-grade than junk, suggesting a strong demand for domestic issues.

HEADLINE: Crops Tailor-Made for Profit;
Farmers Alter Their Way of Life to Assure Sales

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: BURCHINAL, Iowa

 BODY:
When he was growing up, Mike Olk helped his father farm. He, too, became a farmer, and like most Midwest farmers he grew as much yellow feed corn or soybeans as possible. Some of the grain was fed to his own animals and the rest was sold to local elevators.
 So, last fall, why did the 39-year-old Mr. Olk spend $650,000 on fancy computerized machinery that weighs, stores and dries grain? 
 "It all boils down to money," Mr. Olk (pronounced Oak) said. By taking advantage of his fancy new machinery to win specialized contracts to grow higher-priced strains of corn and soybeans for domestic and foreign buyers, Mr. Olk can count on making tens of thousands of dollars more than he would if he had continued to follow in his father's footsteps.
 Crop contracts are part of a trend in the agricultural heartland toward reshaping farming to be more like industry. Contracting is not new to fruit and vegetable growers or to farmers producing crops like barley for the beer industry and the corn and beans that become next year's seed. But until recently it was rare in much of the Midwest.
 Now, with commodity prices in the doldrums and with Government price supports shrinking, more Midwest farmers are looking to lift profits by tailoring their crops to the needs of customers, even if that means having to invest in big-ticket machinery.
 Indeed, the food production and marketing chain is becoming more tightly linked, in a transformation that closely resembles what is happening to companies supplying industrial giants like General Motors and mass retailers like Wal-Mart.
 For the consumer, industrialization should lead to lower inflation in food prices. For farmers, it should lead to more stable earnings and spell the difference between profits and red ink in lean years. And for the middlemen, it clearly results in more efficiency and higher profits.
 Mr. Olk is growing 300 acres of white corn for use by Quaker Oats in Cap'n Crunch cereal; 350 acres of a recently developed strain of high-oil yellow corn that Du Pont is buying for export to Latin American poultry farms, and 700 acres of high-quality soybeans that Midwest Soya, a food broker in Clear Lake, Iowa, will export to Japanese food companies.
 Such crops must be dried and stored separately from standard grain, most of which goes to animal feed, just as an oil company keeps high-octane gasoline separate from regular blends. The aging grain elevator of the Burchinal Cooperative cannot store specialty crops separately from its several million bushels of regular soybeans and corn.
 For Mr. Olk, the crops under contract take up less than a quarter of his total acreage, but he expects the percentage to grow. He is also marketing his excess drying and storage capacity to neighbors, who can then look for their own contracts with Du Pont and Agri Industries, the unit of Cargill Inc. that handles contract buying for Quaker.
 The contracts and other aspects of industrialization -- from specialization to creating ever-larger farms by renting from landowners -- are a result of a combination of economics and the kind of advanced technology that gives farmers much greater control over their soil, animals and produce. Seed suppliers, for example, are manipulating plant genes to invent new crops with such traits as insect and pesticide resistance, unusually high oil or protein levels or lower fat content.
 The question on many farmers' minds now is how far industrialization will go. The most rapidly industrializing sector -- pork production -- has seen contract farming jump from 2 percent in 1980 to more than 20 percent, with no signs of slowing. The share of food and feed grain grown under contract has tripled by some estimates to 6 percent, from less than 2 percent in 1970.
 Some agricultural leaders like Thomas Urban Jr., chairman and chief executive of Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., the country's largest seed company, expect the percentage of grain grown under contract to jump to 20 percent during the next 10 years.
 Mike Olk is almost a textbook case of the trend. He got rid of his livestock in the 1980's. His farm has grown to several thousand acres through renting land, and he has had to hire helpers. He is subcontracting work like pesticide spraying. And he has begun to plant and harvest for neighbors to help pay for the top-of-the-line equipment he has bought.
 But in the conservative heartland, a region wary of big business and newfangled technology, some aspects of industrialization have provoked conflict and anxiety.
 The downside of hog factories -- their rigid operating methods, their threat to small farmers, their neighbor-unfriendly stench -- has given rise to fears that the more subtle industrialization of grain farming could also have its unwelcome side. Ultimately, farmers have to decide whether farming is more a business than a way of life -- whether they will grow what customers want or stick to traditional commodities that give them more independence but less stability.
 An increasing number of grain farmers, according to the Agriculture Department, are taking the partial step of signing forward contracts. With the contracts, farmers plant what they choose and have complete control over how they handle their crop. But they commit themselves to a buyer -- and often a specific price -- long before harvest.
 Many farmers experimented with forward contracts in the 1970's when spikes in demand fueled by sporadic large grain sales to the Soviet Union caused prices to gyrate sharply. Now, more farmers see such contracts as a useful way to reduce risks in any market.
 Others are going further by signing contracts even before their crops are planted. The contracts may require investments like Mr. Olk's new grain-handling system, limit what the farmers plant and restrict some of their farming practices.
 Mr. Olk's contract with Du Pont, for example, requires him to use seed supplied by that company. To achieve the purity required of a premium specialty crop, he must plant his crop far enough from other corn so that wind-blown pollen from other strains will not contaminate it.
 And contracts may become more embracing. Frito-Lay, a unit of Pepsico, has begun experimenting with "whole farm" contracts, under which it buys everything a corn farmer grows at a specified price. Such contracts have been used in the past only in niche markets where so little produce is openly traded that it is hard to agree on a market price.
 Crop contracts underscore the increasing need for farmers to have the same management skills as other business executives. "The guy who knows soil and animal husbandry like the back of his hand may not do as well in years to come as the farmer who is a good negotiator," said Mitchell Moreheart, an Agriculture Department researcher who has been studying the impact of industrialization on farming.
 Critics of industrialization say Midwest grain farmers need look only at the pork industry to see how drastic the changes can be. Iowa is following the lead of states like North Carolina and Missouri in what some describe as a shift from breeding pigs to manufacturing pork. Small family-run enterprises are giving way to megafarms owned by a corporation, or other large investor, that raise hundreds, even thousands of hogs. A farmer gets a three- to five-year contract guaranteeing a final price. In buildings erected to corporate specifications, the farmer follows management's rules in breeding the animals -- in some cases specializing in just one part of their life, like the final fattening before slaughter.
 "It's the franchising of the farm economy," said Marty Strange, co-director of the Center for Rural Affairs in Walthill, Neb. The changes have sharply reduced the number of farmers needed to raise pigs and produced more uniform animals for processors. But they have also ignited bitter disputes among neighbors over the megafarms' odor.
 Few experts, however, expect grain farmers to become as tied to production contracts as the pork operators have. Hogs can be confined indoors, but even with improved strains of grain seed, weather remains a big variable for crops. Specialty crops may command a higher price per bushel, but unless they get optimal conditions they may also yield fewer bushels per acre.
 Farmers may also hold back from fear that the companies supplying the seed, chemicals, marketing connections and food-processing capabilities will drive harder and harder bargains as more farmers sign contracts. For example, purchasers might cut the premiums they are offering or demand that farmers buy expensive irrigation equipment.
 Yet the pressure on grain farmers to trade independence for customer satisfaction is bound to grow, industry leaders say.
 "Our goal," said Dean Kleckner, executive director of the Farm Bureau, a group based in Park Ridge, Ill., that represents 4.5 million farmers, "is no longer to sell what we can produce but to produce what we can sell."

But Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, and other Republicans have introduced a bill to derail the proposal. 
 The question of normalizing relations flared anew on Tuesday after Vietnamese officials turned over a long-requested batch of documents about Americans missing in action.
Senior officials said there is increasing pressure in the Administration, especially within the State Department, to recognize Vietnam. They said that position is being pushed hardest by Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, but also by the President's economic advisers, especially Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown.
These officials and several people lobbying on the issue noted, however, that some National Security Council aides, notably Nancy Soderberg, chief of staff to the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, oppose the move because they fear it could hurt Mr. Clinton politically. Mr. Lake is leaning against full diplomatic relations with Vietnam, the officials said. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has not made up his mind, a senior aide said.
The question of recognition is one of the most emotional and delicate foreign policy issues the Administration faces. On one side are business groups worried about losing opportunities in the world's fastest-growing region and diplomats hoping to increase American influence as a counterweight to China. On the other are veterans' groups, the families of missing American servicemen and White House advisers who worry about reviving criticism of Mr. Clinton's avoidance of the draft.
The proposed Republican bill, co-sponsored by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, one of Mr. Dole's presidential rivals, said the President should not recognize Vietnam until it has provided full disclosure of all information about the 1,619 Americans missing in Vietnam.
Senator Robert Smith, a New Hampshire Republican who introduced the bill, said: "I think the Administration definitely wants to normalize. I think it's on a fast track within the Administration."
Proponents of normalization have also been scrambling in recent days to thwart that attack. Two decorated Vietnam veterans -- Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat -- maneuvered today to make it easier for Mr. Clinton to grant recognition by saying they would soon introduce a resolution calling on the President to recognize Vietnam -- a step being pursued by many business groups as well.
President Clinton lifted the two-decade-old trade embargo against Vietnam last year, after the Senate approved a bill that those two Senators had introduced calling for an end to the embargo.
"For the sake of America, maybe it's time we ended the war," Mr. McCain, who spent seven years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam, said in an interview. "I believe normalization would be an important part of the healing process."
Administration officials said no formal recommendation would be made to Mr. Clinton until a Presidential delegation, comprised of officials from the Pentagon, State Department, National Security Council and Department of Veterans Affairs, returns next week from a trip to Vietnam and other Asian countries.
Several officials said the President might grant recognition before Secretary of State Christopher visits Asia in July, well before the presidential campaign heats up. Others said they would not be surprised if the President played it safe politically and granted recognition after the elections in November 1996.
Mr. McCain and several Administration officials asserted that normalization is the best strategy to pursue the main goal of the United States: to gain the fullest possible accounting of missing Americans. Opening an embassy, they say, would insure continued cooperation from the Vietnamese and make it easier for Washington to investigate such cases.
But Senator Smith argues that the only way to gain the fullest possible accounting is by not granting Vietnam the biggest carrot -- recognition -- until it has provided full disclosure of all information on the M.I.A.'s.
Other sponsors of his bill include Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Mr. Smith insists that Vietnam is not close to providing all the information it has. "It still refuses to release a lot of archival information," he said. "We know based on our own intelligence that there is still information they can provide us on a number of cases."
Under Senator Smith's bill, the President could grant recognition only after certifying that Hanoi has been "fully forthcoming" with information about missing servicemen.
When the Presidential delegation returns from Vietnam, it will analyze the more than 200 pages of analysis and documents Vietnam provided about missing Americans.
A senior State Department official said the view held by Mr. Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State, is that Vietnam deserves recognition because it has provided all the cooperation about missing servicemen that President Bush asked of it four years ago, when he laid out a road map of how it might win normalization.
"The Vietnamese are clearly trying to demonstrate as much cooperation as they can," a senior official said.
According to the President's advisers, Mr. Clinton might approach normalization in several ways. Having agreed to exchange liaison offices last January, he might next decide to open an embassy and exchange ambassadors. Another option would be to announce recognition but send a charge d'affaires instead of a full ambassador. If Vietnam showed continued cooperation on M.I.A.'s, then a decision to exchange ambassadors would follow.
To pave the way for recognition, Administration officials said, the State Department will soon fix up a mansion in Hanoi for the first American ambassador. In addition, the United States is holding talks with Vietnam about human rights, and Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gelbard will soon travel to Hanoi to discuss anti-narcotics efforts.
Corporate America is one of the major forces behind the push for normalization with this economically dynamic country of 75 million.
Major companies say normalization should include not just recognition but also preferential trade status. They also want the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to provide insurance for American companies doing business in Vietnam and the Export-Import Bank to provide low-cost financing.

HEADLINE: Debt-Plagued County Likely To Get Relief

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 19

 BODY:
Orange County is on the verge of an important step in its efforts to emerge from the largest municipal bankruptcy on record. Investors in nearly $1 billion of the county's bonds have agreed in principle to wait a year for repayment, county officials and lawyers involved in the negotiations said today.
The deal, if it is completed, would be a landmark, one of a very few such extensions ever worked out in the municipal bond market. 
 All those involved said the deal was a compromise that recognized the county's serious financial predicament while it avoided an outright default on the bonds, which would have come due over the next several months.
In addition to agreeing to extend the repayment for a year, bondholders have also agreed to significant reductions in the interest rate to be paid.
"This gives us some breathing room," said William J. Popejoy, the county's interim chief executive. "It is not a solution to our problems, but it looks very close, and we believe we're going to put together something that calms the marketplace and avoids an actual default on the bonds."
Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy attorney, emphasized: "This doesn't improve the overall financial situation of the county. It gives us one year to come up with new sources of revenue. It's an important interim step."
Mr. Bennett said the agreement was likely to be completed and submitted to the court overseeing Orange County's bankruptcy next week. The complex plan is subject to the approval of the court and of 90 percent of the owners of the bonds about to come due.
Nevertheless, all sides said they had hopes that the agreement would hold; indeed, at this time it is regarded as the best the investors in the bonds can hope for. A committee representing the largest bondholders has already reviewed and appears to have tentatively approved most of the plan.
Orange County stunned the financial markets when it filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 6 after losing $1.7 billion in a big investment fund. Its former treasurer, Robert L. Citron, had made highly risky investments using complex securities called derivatives, which magnified the extent of his losses when interest rates rose last year and bond prices plunged.
The filing was particularly surprising because Orange County, an area of beaches, country clubs and affluent suburbs just south of here, is one of the wealthiest counties in the country, and its economy is generally sound.
Mr. Citron has since pleaded guilty to six felony charges related to the losses, and the county has been left to grope its way to financial recovery. It has slashed its budget by 41 percent, laid off about 10 percent of its work force and is selling assets in a desperate bid to regain its financial footing.
An agreement on extending the bond repayment dates has been described as one of two essential steps for stabilizing the county. The other step is passage of a half-cent increase in the sales tax, to 8.25 cents per dollar. The tax increase is being bitterly opposed in the conservative county, and a vote on June 27 is expected to be very close.
The tentative agreement reported today covers $975 million of bonds that come due in several steps over the next several months. Under the agreement, repayment would be deferred until June 30, 1996.
Also, the bondholders have agreed to accept a significantly lower interest rate over the next year because the county does not have the money to pay a full market rate.
At the end of the extended period, the bondholders and the county will negotiate payment of additional interest, with the amounts depending on the county's financial ability, the lawyers said.
"This is very, very difficult for them to accept," said Robert Moore, the lead attorney for the bondholders. But, he added, "We've made reasonable progress on all the open issues with the exception of one economic issue, and I'm hopeful there will be movement on that over the weekend."

HEADLINE: Rhode Island's Senate Sends Gay-Rights Bill to Governor

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
The Rhode Island Senate extended civil-rights guarantees to homosexuals last night, approving a measure that would bar discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations and credit on the basis of sexual orientation.
Gov. Lincoln C. Almond, a Republican, will sign the measure into law, his spokesman said, perhaps as early as Monday. That would make Rhode Island the ninth state to offer specific civil rights protections to homosexuals and the first to do so in two years. 
 The 26-to-21 vote in the Rhode Island Senate capped 11 years of lobbying by gay and lesbian groups and came after four successive defeats in the Legislature. The House of Representatives approved the bill 57 to 41 in March.
The legislation was seen as an important gain nationally for the lesbian and gay civil rights movement, which suffered a major setback a week ago when a Federal appeals court upheld the right of Cincinnati voters to deprive homosexuals of legal protections.
State Senator William P. Fitzpatrick, Democrat of Cranston, who is openly gay and shepherded the Rhode Island bill through the State House in Providence, said, "It's a small state but it's a big victory." He said it was the most significant legislative success since 1993, when a similar measure was passed in Minnesota and signed by Gov. Arne Carlson, a Republican.
Other statewide measures have been enacted in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Vermont and Wisconsin.
Christine Nickerson, the president of the Rhode Island Alliance for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights, said the bill took so many years to pass because "it took a long time to educate people, even to give them a chance to meet gay men and lesbians."
A former president of the alliance, Julie Pell, said there had been a cumulative effect of testimony about discrimination from men and women who were openly gay. "We all know our legislators," she said. "We run into them in the grocery store. When people come out, it makes even more of an impression."
Governor Almond's communications director, Jim Taricani, said the Governor believed the bill was "unfortunately necessary."
Opponents disagreed, arguing that homosexuals do not merit protected status because they are neither economically deprived nor lacking in political influence.
Jerry Burchette, the president of the Coalition to Preserve Traditional Values, also said the bill would "have the effect of trampling under foot the religious rights of the individual to make choices of conscience concerning homosexuality."
Religious leaders were found on both sides of the issue. Bishop Louis E. Gelineau of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence explained in the diocesan newspaper why he had not spoken out against the bill.
"If proposed legislation attempts to condone or promote homosexual activity by equating morally all forms of sexual behavior, then it should be defeated," Bishop Gelineau wrote. "If it merely seeks to afford protection from unjust discrimination, which is not now afforded under our laws, then those laws should be changed."
As the Rhode Island battle entered its final days, the Cincinnati case was often cited by opponents of the bill. The decision came from the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which said laws could not be drafted that protect an "unidentifiable" class of citizens, like homosexuals, who make themselves known only by their conduct.

Icahn Reported Buying Up Rockefeller Center's Debt

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Carl C. Icahn, the financier best-known for wresting Trans World Airlines from its management, has been buying up the debt of Rockefeller Center Properties Inc., the real estate investment trust that holds the $1.3 billion mortgage on Rockefeller Center.
Traders said yesterday that Mr. Icahn's investment firm had been accumulating the trust's bonds since two partnerships that own Rockefeller Center filed for bankruptcy on May 11. The trust is the largest creditor of the partnerships, in which the Mitsubishi Estate Company of Japan has an 80 percent stake and the Rockefeller family has a 20 percent stake. 
 Mr. Icahn was out of his office yesterday and could not be reached for comment.
 As of the end of last year, Mr. Icahn's firm also owned less than 1 percent of Rockefeller Center Properties' 38.26 million shares, most of which are held by individual investors.
 Once known as a corporate raider, Mr. Icahn in recent years has become one of a clique of investors who specialize in buying stakes in distressed companies and parlaying them into savvy investments.
 Many such "vulture" investors have stayed on the sidelines of the Rockefeller Center bankruptcy, however, because the real estate trust's debt has not traded at low enough prices to entice them. Recently, the convertible debentures carrying a 13 percent interest rate and maturing in 2000 have traded at about $97 for every $100 of face value, while the zero-coupon convertible debentures maturing in 2000 have traded at about $48 or $49.
 Separately, Alan Miller, the lawyer representing the real estate trust, said there was no truth to rumors swirling in the market yesterday that the trust planned to file a motion asking Judge Prudence B. Abram to appoint a trustee to administer Rockefeller Center during the bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Sumitomo, World's Biggest Bank, to Post Loss, a Rarity in Japanese Finance

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 19

 BODY:
It's the biggest bank in the world, owns a chunk of Goldman, Sachs, is being harassed and shot at by gangsters, and is little known outside Japan.
 Sumitomo Bank Ltd. has amassed the equivalent of about $624 billion in assets, about two and a half times as much as Citibank, by daring to blaze its own trail in a country that preaches conformity. But now it is facing an array of new challenges that underscore the turmoil in Japan's financial sector. 
 Since 1916, when Sumitomo became the first private bank in Japan to expand overseas, it has been one of the country's most aggressive and profitable institutions. Next week, its aggressiveness will take a new turn, as it takes losses in writing off a large chunk of bad debt. Sumitomo will report a loss for the fiscal year that ended on March 31, becoming the first Japanese bank in the postwar period to report an annual loss. At least three other Japanese banks are also expected to post losses this month.
 Analysts love this sort of aggressiveness, but customers often don't. A survey among corporate banking customers this month found that Sumitomo was the most unpopular bank in Japan -- apparently because it has the temerity to turn down credit risks.
 "If there is any Japanese bank that is most like an American bank, it is Sumitomo," said a Japanese banker at one of Sumitomo's competitors. "It is the most profit-driven. If your industry doesn't have potential, they won't lend to you."
Sumitomo's experience is a warning light to other banks with growth aspirations, particularly the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which is expected to be formed next spring through the merger of the Bank of Tokyo Ltd. and Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. and will be more than one-third larger than Sumitomo is now.
 Just a few years ago, size and status were everything to a bank. That's why Sumitomo acquired a first class art collection, including a Renoir that reportedly cost $60 million.
 The problem is that in its quest for profits and size, Sumitomo failed to become more efficient at home. To be sure, most of the blame for Sumitomo's domestic inefficiency lies not with the executives of Sumitomo but with stifling Japanese regulations that never made the domestic consumer market very appealing or lucrative.
 But now the regulations are changing, opening up new areas like retail banking in ways that will probably touch off banking wars.
 Banks are facing other mine fields. Demand for credit has been weak for months, sinking interest rates threaten to erode loan margins, a depressed stock market is battering equity portfolios and write-offs of bad loans are shrinking the size of their capital.
 In the 1980's, when becoming an international superbank was a vision for many bankers around the world, the go-go growth in Japan led its bankers to lend recklessly at home and expand breathlessly overseas. Sumitomo added 14 offices abroad in the late 1980's, invested $500 million in Goldman, Sachs and racked up a pile of bad loans.
 It is now paying for that wild growth. It was forced to absorb a large client, Itoman, that collapsed in the middle of an art scandal and led to the resignation in 1990 of Sumitomo's chairman, Ichiro Isoda. Write-downs related to Itoman also make up a significant part of this year's losses, which are expected to be between 250 billion yen and 300 billion yen, or $3 billion to $3.6 billion.
 Then for more than a year, Sumitomo had a series of bizarre brushes with the Japanese underworld. It was the target of more than a dozen attacks, presumably stemming from business dealings with crime syndicates or loans turned sour.
 In 1993, a Molotov cocktail was tossed into the residence of Tatsumi Sotoo, the bank's current chairman. Then, apparently in a separate incident last fall, an executive director in the bank's Nagoya branch was fatally shot.
 Now Sumitomo seems to be turning a new page, at least bringing itself into line with banks in the rest of the modern world. It is building a new computer system, extending banking hours, expanding its lending to small companies and developing better techniques for risk management. It is also cleansing its books and trimming its size to prepare for the next bout of fierce competition.
 "Japan has been behind the United States by 10 years," said the refined president of Sumitomo, Toshio Morikawa, an English speaker who recently stepped down as the industry's leading spokesman. "We see this year as the dawn of a new era of liberalization."
 Last fall, the Ministry of Finance allowed banks to start setting their own rates on their deposits, and bankers worried they would be pulled into the kind of "toaster wars" -- free giveaways for new deposit customers -- that rattled the American retail banking industry in the 1980's.
 But prospects appear grim for that kind of rapid transformation in Japan. Indeed, while some small Japanese financial institutions are offering lottery tickets and savings account rates linked to baseball batting averages or summer temperatures, larger banks like Sumitomo believe such sales techniques are demeaning to their reputation.
 Moreover, the pressure to conform is still strong. The genteel banking association successfully enforces a rule on its member banks that limits the monetary value of souvenirs offered to customers to three small gifts each of 500 yen, or about $6.
 Some bankers and analysts say that rather than adopting an overarching strategy for the future, Sumitomo is still searching, still regrouping from several years of tumult.
 "Not only Sumitomo, but all the major banks are trying to find a way to survive," said a senior official at a Japanese bank. "For five decades after World War II, bankers have lived in a highly regulated industry and top banks look so similar to each other."
 Almost uniformly, the Japanese banks have neglected the consumer. Compared with American institutions, Japanese banks offer very few products -- no telephone banking, mutual funds, credit or debit cards, money market accounts or C.D.'s.
 While Japanese consumers take out home mortgages, they traditionally have been reluctant to borrow, and banks do not offer overdraft privileges or education loans. Even auto loans are limited.
 "The man in the street sees a bank as a place to put money, not get money," said Mark N. J. Faulkner, a bank analyst at S. G. Warburg Securities (Japan) Inc.
 But many bankers and analysts say that may be changing. And the bank that is leading the way ahead is Sumitomo's comrade in spirit, Citicorp, whose expansion in Japan with American-style service puts Sumitomo and other Japanese institutions to shame. Embracing primarily the affluent Japanese consumer, it has set up a network of A.T.M.'s and telephone services that run 24 hours a day. The bank also offers a variety of currency exchange and other products in several cities throughout the country.
 In contrast, Japanese A.T.M.'s are generally open only until 7 P.M., with limited hours on weekends. The problem is that in Japan, there is no checking system. No one writes checks, and no one has a checking account.
 So while some payments can be automatically debited, Japanese consumers rely on A.T.M.'s to pay for newspaper subscriptions, tuition, telephone, and electricity bills among others and must incur the costly charges. To improve its service to customers, Sumitomo is extending its A.T.M. hours to 9 P.M., but not until November.
 Not surprisingly, those who think Sumitomo is not aggressive enough, at least in reaching out to its customers, are Americans.
 "Sumitomo is well known, but staid and conservative," said Robert M. Berardy, consumer marketing manager of Japan operations at Citibank, N.A. "Why can't Sumitomo do 24-hour A.T.M. service?"

HEADLINE: $49.7 Billion Budget Surplus Posted in April, a U.S. Record

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
The Government reported today that it had its largest one-month budget surplus in history last month, reflecting record revenues and the annual flood of income tax payments from individuals close to the April 17 deadline.
 The $49.72 billion surplus for April was almost three times greater than the $17.454 billion surplus in the same month a year earlier, according to the Treasury's budget statement. In March, the United States posted a $49.927-billion deficit. 
 The impact of large individual and corporation tax deposits sent budget receipts to a record high of $165.4 billion last month, the Treasury Department said. Spending, meanwhile, declined from a year earlier.
 Not counting refunds, collections from individual taxpayers in April were $19.5 billion higher than in the same month a year earlier, the Treasury said.
 The April improvement continues a trend of narrowing Federal budget deficits since the Clinton Administration took office. For the first seven months of the fiscal year 1995, the deficit was $94.284 billion, down 28.9 percent from $132.688 billion for the October-through-April period in the previous fiscal year.
 The report came a day after the House approved a plan to eliminate the deficit by 2002.
 In addition to tax payments due in April, last month's budget surplus was bolstered by "a calendar quirk in March," said Scott Brown, an economist at the investment firm Raymond James & Associates Inc. in St. Petersburg, Fla.
 Because April 1 fell on a Saturday, the Government mailed entitlement checks to retirees, veterans and other beneficiaries in late March. That caused the March deficit to balloon by several billion dollars. Benefit checks, like Social Security, are not mailed on weekends or holidays.
 For the entire fiscal year, the budget deficit is on target to total $180 billion to $190 billion, analysts said, an improvement from the $203.267 billion deficit reported for the fiscal year 1994.
 If that happens, the budget deficit as a percentage of the gross domestic product would decline to 2.7 percent for this year from 4.9 percent in 1992, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Why Choose Times Sq. For a Hotel Complex?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your May 12 article on the plans by Disney and developers to build a hotel complex in Times Square and your editorial "Disney on 42d Street" (May 13): 
 Charles Gargano, chairman of the State Urban Development Corporation, said in his announcement of this project that "Times Square represents the vibrancy, creativity and soul of New York." What is so sacrosanct about Times Square?
The soul and greatness of New York can be found not in its popular sites, nor in its tall buildings, but in its people and their institutions.
The proposed gigantic project would prove to be a great blunder in urban planning. The area, the city's most traffic-congested spot, also teems with pedestrians. Any additional big structures would intensify the strangulation of the central area of the city.
There is no question that the seedy parts of Times Square need regeneration. However, the plan must be slimmed down and aimed not at increasing but at decreasing the density of commercial movement. The ideal solution would be to transform the area into an arts-and-culture hub, to reflect the real soul of our city.
And think also what lasting benefits New York would derive from a $300 million project developed elsewhere, in a more appropriate part of the city.

BATTLING FOR PEACE
A Memoir.
By Shimon Peres.
Edited by David Landau.
Illustrated. 350 pp. New York:
Random House. $25. 
TOWARD the end of this memoir, Shimon Peres, the Israeli politician and leader, likens himself to the "unpaid dreamer" of a short story by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Indeed, Mr. Peres has been vilified, not praised, by his own people for the visionary approach he has brought to a political career that spans six decades. Israeli politicians and journalists have castigated him as "Israel's Nixon" for what they see as his inauthenticity, and have dismissed him as superficial for his compulsion to churn out new ideas regardless of their weight or wisdom.
That explains why Mr. Peres, currently Israel's Foreign Minister, seeks to portray himself now as victor and victim, to stake out his place in history as a peacemaker and to settle scores like any other politician. He makes no excuses for his optimistic world view. On the contrary, he tries to explain and defend it, not only for posterity but for whatever remains of his political career. "I feel I have earned the right to dream," he writes. "This book is my personal testimony to the fact that it is permissible for a man to dream -- not just any dreams, but great dreams."
Although "Battling for Peace" is brief by American autobiographical standards, it traverses Mr. Peres's 71-year life and his performance in almost every key ministerial job. He speaks here with the voice of the unabashed romantic (which sounds fine in English, but is not likely to play well back home when the memoir is published in Hebrew). Born Shimon Persky, the "adored firstborn" of a well-off merchant family in a Belarussian shtetl, he relates his arrival in "Jewish Palestine" at age 10. As a teen-ager he devoured Dostoyevsky, edited his high school newspaper, flirted with Communism and dreamed of his future as a "brawny, sunburned kibbutz farmer, plowing the fields of the fertile Jezreel Valley by day, singing lustily in the common dining room at suppertime, guarding the perimeter fearlessly by night on a fleet-footed horse."
Yet the book is a reminder of the concrete achievements that Mr. Peres's dreams helped produce. As the 29-year-old director general of the Israeli Defense Ministry under his mentor, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, Mr. Peres helped build Israel a modern army, secretly buying arms from Western and Eastern Europe. Against all odds, and despite a profound lack of enthusiasm in most of the Cabinet, he later helped make Israel a nuclear power -- covertly importing hundreds of French scientists, commissioning Israel's top architects and engineers, begging for money from Israel's friends around the world and building roads while laying miles of power lines and water pipes for the massive desert project at Dimona. During his two years as Prime Minister in the mid-1980's, he extricated most of Israel's troops from Lebanon, an occupation he called "bloody and pointless," and shrank Israel's inflation rate from 800 percent to 20 percent. Perhaps most important, had it not been for the combination of Mr. Peres's dreams and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's sang-froid, a peace accord between Israelis and Palestinians might never have happened.
Mr. Peres is a master of the telling detail that both captures the moment and entrances the reader. There is the American diplomat Averell Harriman, seducing Mr. Peres into downing glasses of Russian vodka at a White House lunch, saying, "Let's drink it for its taste and ignore its origin." And Moshe Dayan as military Chief of Staff, shooting pigeons with his shotgun from his office balcony so that he would have a main course for his 39th-birthday party dinner. And Uganda's President Idi Amin, protecting the passengers on the hijacked jet at Entebbe after being sweet-talked by the Israelis into believing that he might win a Nobel Prize. And King Hussein, clearly one of Mr. Peres's heroes, joking irreverently about President Ronald Reagan's sincere inquiry about fishing in the Dead Sea.
The clarity of Mr. Peres's impressions in those instances makes one long for more. Peace with the Palestinians would have been impossible without the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, yet he appears only fleetingly. Even the casual reader will find it frustrating that Mr. Peres omits his intense exchanges with Mr. Arafat over ideology and territory, and their endless negotiations over such mundane issues as the color of the protective glass at Palestinian checkpoints.
The flaw of "Battling for Peace" is that Mr. Peres tries to answer history too soon. His memoir is two years too early and 200 pages too short. Like a meal with both satisfying and skimpy courses, the book is at times brilliant, at times uneven. Mr. Peres's only turn as Prime Minister is dealt with in a nine-page chapter; he shares his impressions of American Presidents -- from John F. Kennedy to George Bush -- in six pages at the end of his chapter on the Iran-contra affair. Bill Clinton is not included.
Still, Mr. Peres has produced a volume that combines a well-argued political analysis with elegant prose (perhaps with the help of his editor, the Israeli journalist David Landau). Unlike many other writers on the Middle East, he does not assume extensive knowledge of Israel, making his book accessible to nonexperts on the region.
The memoir gives Mr. Peres the opportunity to settle scores, and settle he does. His rivalry with Mr. Rabin has been well documented over the years, and Mr. Peres is torn between his desire to defend himself and his desire to stand, statesmanlike, above the fray. There was no "special comradeship between us," he writes.
Some of the complaints seem petty. Mr. Peres feels obliged, for example, to take exception to the charge in Mr. Rabin's own 1979 memoir that he opposed Mr. Ben-Gurion's appointment of Mr. Rabin as military Chief of Staff. He also writes that he was "aghast" to read in the same book that he told people before the 1967 Middle East war that Israel couldn't and mustn't fight. He calls Mr. Rabin's charge that he was involved in leaking records of his conversations with Henry Kissinger in the mid-1970's "another unfounded allegation." And he denies Mr. Rabin's assertion that he ever tried to undermine him during the 1974-77 Government led by Mr. Rabin.
With strains like these, it is hard to comprehend how the two men have actually worked with each other. But somehow, when it comes to serious matters, Israel's ministers seem to stick together. Thus Mr. Peres explains how Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Mr. Rabin and he circled the wagons during the Reagan Administration's ill-fated venture into swapping arms for hostages with Iran. And after his galling defeat by Mr. Rabin for Prime Minister in June 1992, Mr. Peres concludes that "bitterness is not statesmanship," and he credits Mr. Rabin with giving him the chance to carry out the months of secret negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization that led to the Israeli-Palestinian accord. Mr. Rabin "was skeptical about the Oslo talks," Mr. Peres writes of the crucial weeks in the late spring of 1993. "Sometimes he wholly disbelieved in them. . . . Nonetheless, he gave me, and the talks, a chance. And ultimately, when the final goal became attainable, he did not draw back."
SINCE Mr. Peres is still working for Mr. Rabin, it is not surprising that he withholds the stories of their continuing animosity: his deep resentment on the day of the Israeli-Palestinian signing ceremony at the White House, when Mr. Rabin at first excluded him from the Israeli delegation; his humiliation when, in meetings with American officials, Mr. Rabin interrupted him to deliver the punch lines of his jokes.
As statesmanlike as he tries to be, Mr. Peres makes no effort to hide his most painful diplomatic disappointment: his failure in the late 1980's to make a separate peace with Jordan. A lifelong admirer of King Hussein, he reveals the details of their secret meeting in London in 1987, which produced a written framework for peace between the two countries. Both the King and Mr. Peres wanted the Americans to present the agreement as an American proposal. But Prime Minister Shamir sabotaged the scheme by secretly sending his envoy, Moshe Arens, to Washington to inform Secretary of State George P. Shultz that if the United States presented the plan, it would be considered crass interference in Israel's internal affairs. Mr. Shultz agreed, and Mr. Peres, who expected more from the Americans, never forgave him.
That sense of betrayal, Mr. Peres now writes, was one of his reasons, six years later, for excluding the Clinton Administration from the secret channel in Oslo that produced the accord with the Palestinians. "I learned my lesson from the London agreement," Mr. Peres says he told Warren Christopher, Bill Clinton's Secretary of State. "Shultz got cold feet at the last moment." According to the American side, these words were never spoken.
"Battling for Peace" is neither the beginning nor the end of the story. Mr. Peres's 1993 book, "The New Middle East," was a sweeping, albeit fantastic, vision of a region where peace and prosperity would one day reign. In this volume, he tells his readers: "My life's work is not yet done. The final, crowning chapters of my biography are still being written at this time."

Fix-It Journalism

BYLINE: By MAX FRANKEL 

 BODY:
A HALF-CENTURY ago, Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger detected what she thought was an appalling ignorance of American history among allegedly educated college graduates. The daughter, wife and mother of newspaper executives, she used her influence to encourage The New York Times to test her hypothesis in a national survey. The survey found that only 18 percent of the nation's colleges and universities required students to take a course in American history. The revelation prompted many schools to change their degree requirements and won a Pulitzer Prize for The Times. Since then, unfortunately, a lot more American history, including Mrs. Sulzberger's modest crusade, has been forgotten.
I invoke its memory now because present newspaper owners and editors think they are inventing a new ideology when they ask journalists to use their skills and influence to promote civic virtue. Their movement, which they call "public" or "civic" journalism, seeks a new "connection" with the community to cure it of "political disaffection." That will happen, they believe, if news coverage becomes a more deliberate act of citizenship, dedicated to the solution and not just description of social problems. And while many of them would praise Mrs. Sulzberger for having done just that 52 years ago, the true devotees of civic journalism would deride her willingness to settle for a few articles that only incidentally shamed college deans into action. 
 The ardent civic journalists of today are not content to tell it like it is. They want to tell it and fix it all at once. They would summon those college deans to a conference and make them either defend their neglect of history or promise prompt remedial action, with front-page punishment or reward. Also invited to the conference would be legislators and foundation heads so that they could be badgered into providing the funds to endow the necessary new chairs in American history. Famous names from business and academia would grace the stage and alliances with television would guarantee more attention than newspapers alone can command.
Just such conferences -- to air public concerns and to propel communities into action -- figure prominently in the list of "public life projects" that civic journalists are organizing around the country.
The Detroit Free Press has been waging a "Children First" campaign, raising money for summer recreation, summoning cabinet members and experts to a forum on violence against children, giving reporters time off for volunteer work in schools. The Charlotte Observer is rousing citizens in a campaign called "Taking Back Our Neighborhoods" -- leading televised discussions and directing charities to the most neglected parts of town. The Sun in Bremerton, Wash., teamed up with the local electric company to promote economic development that could compensate for the loss of military installations. The San Jose Mercury News lavished special coverage and free newspapers on one low-income precinct to try, inconclusively, to get out the vote last November. The Norfolk Virginian-Pilot formed a "public life team" of reporters formally pledged to "revitalize a democracy that has grown sick with disenchantment" and to "lead the community to discover itself and act on what it has learned."
Newspapers in the Knight-Ridder chain have been in the forefront of this campaign. Most of their editors, coming from elsewhere, think civic journalism will keep their staffs in touch with local readers without compromising traditional standards of fairness and nonpartisanship. But some of their publishers, and also those in the Gannett chain, love the idea for less disinterested reasons. They think their staffs' community involvement can sell papers and advertising. Some think civic journalism is the perfect response to declining readership. The Knight Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts are major supporters of the movement, and Jay Rosen's Project on Public Life and the Press at New York University provides logistic support and philosophical justification.
Rosen's best argument is that newspapers risk alienation from the community if they mindlessly focus coverage on ineffective governments and disconnected public officials. "The political problem in journalism right now," he has said, "is to find a more immediate, flesh and blood connection to citizens in the public world." But some of his own examples of brilliantly "connected" reportage prove that energetic legwork and empathetic writing could stop well short of community action.
Civic journalists have encountered two valid lines of criticism. Some critics argue that if newspapers aim only to put more reporters "in touch" with ordinary people -- without using their influence to sponsor social or political causes -- then they're only doing what they should have been doing all along. But other critics contend that the emphasis on "solutions" and "connections" will inevitably distort the news agenda, devalue problems for which no easy remedy is apparent and end up compromising the paper's independence.
In response, Rosen has argued that "objectivity" in reporting is an illusion and that even the quest for fairness or balance in news articles can obstruct the truth or understanding of it. But his debunking of some journalistic cliches hardly justifies a new ideology that holds journalism duty bound to stimulate and organize public opinion and action. The elemental tasks of describing events and discerning their causes are already beyond the skills and budgets of many American newsrooms. Running forums, finding speakers and raising money are diversions for most television and newspaper staffs even if such activity had no compromising side effects.
Recipes for action that could safely "connect" a newspaper with its readers sound like recipes for making omelets without breaking eggs. Such action will be either superficial or extremely messy and embarrassing. Given Mrs. Sulzberger's concern about American history, civic journalists would either be content, as she was, to describe the situation or, organizing solutions, they would end up trapped in the crossfire of contending histories -- those of classicists, feminists, ethnicists and all the other obvious factions. And what if college deans thought that mathematics was even more neglected than history? The more energetic a newspaper's initial agitation, the more difficult and incredible would be its retreat to trustworthy observation.
American journalism sorely needs improvement. But redefining journalism as a quest for a better tomorrow will never compensate for its poor performance at explaining yesterday. Reporters, editors and publishers have their hands full learning to tell it right. They should leave reforms to reformers.

Tighter Rules Proposed On Ferry Transport

BYLINE: BY RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Far more than in the United States, ferries are a common means of transportation in Europe. So it was not surprising that the sinking of the ferry Estonia in the Baltic Sea last fall, with the loss of more than 900 lives, sent shudders of fear across the Continent and the islands arrayed around it.
Investigations into the Estonia, which was en route from Tallinn to Stockholm, quickly pinpointed the cause, a faulty bow door that allowed in enough water to destabilize the ship, causing it to list heavily and sink in rough, icy seas. But subsequent studies of how to improve ferry safety have raised a host of questions about ferry design, crew training, evacuation procedures and the trade-offs between maximum passenger safety and economic viability for ferry operators. 
 Whether they are shuttling tourists among the Greek islands, carrying business executives from Stockholm to Helsinki or plying the busy sea lanes across the Channel between England and France, ferries in Europe, and in most of the rest of the world, are regulated by the International Maritime Organization, an agency of the United Nations based in London.
Although safety rules imposed by the organization have become substantially tighter in the last five years, a panel of 22 experts convened by the agency following the loss of the Estonia issued proposals for further regulations last month. The proposals, which are still being debated and perhaps modified within the I.M.O., will be put to a vote by the group's 151 member nations in November.
The focus of the proposals was the class of ship known as the roll-on, roll-off ferry, or ro-ro's. Ro-ro's have large doors at bow and stern that allow cars, trucks and buses to drive directly on and off. The Estonia was a ro-ro, as was the other large European ferry to be involved in a major accident in recent years, the Herald of Free Enterprise, which partly sank near Zeebrugge, Belgium, in 1987, with 134 deaths. Investigators ruled that the most likely cause of that accident was an open bow door.
It takes only a moderate amount of water sloshing around on the vehicle deck of a ro-ro to put the vessel at risk of tipping over. So the safety debate has centered on proposals to require watertight bulkheads, or walls, on the vehicle deck to keep any water in a confined space, minimizing the destabilizing effects.
Some naval architects think multiple bulkheads are a good idea; others think they could create new problems. Ferry companies generally don't want them because they would be extremely expensive to install in existing ships, and would slow the process of getting vehicles on and off. The British Government supports mandatory use of bulkheads, but most other governments are less committed to them.
The I.M.O. panel opted not to require bulkheads in its proposals. Instead, the panel outlined stricter stability requirements for the vessels, and left it to ferry operators and designers how best to meet them. But the stability requirements specifically require designers to consider the effects of large amounts of water on the vehicle deck and of rougher seas.
The panel also proposed that there be an inner door behind the bow door as a second line of defense; that drainage of water from the vehicle deck be improved; that crew members all be able to speak the same language (reportedly a problem on the Estonia, where Finns, Estonians and Swedes worked alongside one another), and that there be better alarms on hull doors.
"The panel is aware that some of its proposals will have severe implications to existing ro-ro passenger ships and may even lead to some ships being forced out of service," the International Maritime Organization group said.
Most of the ferries that would have trouble meeting the new standards, industry executives said, are in southern Europe. They said that the I.M.O. and member countries, including Italy and Greece, were likely to have continuing debates over whether the proposals are too tough, given that many local and regional economies, reliant on ferries for transportation and tourism, would be devastated if ferries were forced out of service.
The ferries that ply the English Channel are already among the newest and most advanced in use anywhere, industry officials said, and would be only moderately affected by the new standards.

A Flare For Fantasy: 'Miami Vice' Meets 42d Street

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
KA-BOOM! ARQUITECTONICA HAS LANDED. LANDed the job, anyhow. The Miami-based architects, renowned for their colorfully jazzed-up modern designs, have been chosen to create a keystone to the multi-building complex that represents the rebirth of Times Square -- the major new convention hotel planned for Eighth Avenue and 42d Street. The legendary mecca of raffish good times and the architectural firm with rhythm, 42d Street and Arquitectonica are a match made in honky-tonk heaven.
The fruit of their union will not be mistaken for the Plaza. Don't expect oak paneling, marble columns or palm trees wafting gently over decorous afternoon teas. Instead, this glitzy Ritz (actually, a Westin) will erupt with vibrant color and flashing lights in a building designed to look like an exploding meteor. Scheduled for completion by Jan. 1, 2000, it's a jazz fanfare for the millennium, an apocalypse with room service. 
 Selected May 11 over competing designs by two internationally prominent architects, Michael Graves and Zaha Hadid, the hotel will be Arquitectonica's first building in New York. It will also enlarge the Times Square presence of the Disney Corporation, which is affiliated in the project with the designated developer, the Tishman Urban Development Corporation, and also responsible for the renovation of the New Amsterdam Theater just east of the hotel site. As the participation of those corporate Goliaths suggests, this architectural fantasy is big-time business, though money for its completion is yet to be raised. Economic return, not esthetic merit, is the paramount goal of the project's government sponsors, the New York State Urban Development Corporation and the New York City Economic Development Corporation.
But the best guys won anyhow. While all three designs were good, Arquitectonica's captured the spirit of place: the unsubtle fusion of erotics and economics that is Times Square. Their design embodies the drives, defenses, fantasies and symbols that animate this legendary crossroads of dollars and desire.
The design is a vertical triptych. Stretching along the north side of 42d Street will be an entertainment and retail complex designed by specialists in retail outlets, D'Agostino Izzo Quirk Architects. Housed in a mix of new and renovated structures, the complex will retain the existing scale of the neighboring low-rise buildings while pumping it full of new life. Restaurants, shops, superstores and an Imax theater are among the uses currently planned.
A 10-story Disney Vacation Club, containing 100 time-share apartments, will anchor the corner of 42d and Eighth, or possibly blow it away, for the jagged-edged structure is supposed to represent a meteor moments after the crash. Rising above the fallen body is the 680-room hotel, a 47-story tower sheathed with colored glass. A curving streak of light, representing the meteor's trail, splits the skyscraper down the middle. Blue-toned glass clads the west side of the tower in a pattern of vertical stripes, while the east side is glazed with horizontal bands of copper and orange. Some will find the tower's esthetic unpleasantly reminiscent of the 1964-65 New York World's Fair. I like the flashback to that populuxe extravaganza.
In accordance with the guidelines for the project, the design makes heavy use of lighting and signs. Immense "supersigns" will march across the retail and entertainment complex in a neon pop art parade. The tower will erupt periodically in a light show designed by Fisher Marantz, the lighting wizards. High-powered beams within the curving "meteor path" will shoot up into the sky, while clouds of "pixie dust" explode at the base.
New York's leading avant-garde architects, Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, have designed a tower of video monitors for the hotel's Eighth Avenue corner, while a 10-story mural of glass mosaics will cover the vacation club with postcard images of New York landmarks. Why should Arquitectonica resort to these Chamber of Commerce cliches? These architects have already demonstrated an unrivaled talent to create dazzling urban icons of their own.
You may have already seen one. The "sky patio," an outdoor terrace punched into the side of one of Arquitectonica's early high-rises in Miami, was featured in the weekly opening credits of the flashy 80's television series "Miami Vice." The design epitomized the firm's ability to enliven a spare modern architectural framework with sensuous, surrealistic flair.
A single, iconic palm tree rises in the patio against the blue sky of tropical paradise. But there's a snake in this garden, a red spiral staircase coiling up behind the palm as if to pluck something from its fronds. Who said that the forbidden fruit wasn't a coconut? Or a Coca-Cola? Or coke?
The colors here are primary; so are the implied emotions. A red balcony juts out from a yellow wall, suspended like a diving platform over a blue-tiled Jacuzzi. The red is the color of lipstick on a collar, of passion, perhaps danger. Will we fall or be pushed? Into the whirlpool or into heaven? Pleasure and risk go hand in hand in this vertiginous realm of the senses.
Arquitectonica started building young. That's the first important thing to know about them. Bernardo Fort-Brescia and Laurinda Spear, who founded the firm in 1977, were the first architects of the baby-boom generation to build prominent, large-scale projects, like the string of residential high-rises they set along Brickell Avenue in Miami in the early 1980's. At an age when most architects are still in their apprenticeship years, Fort-Brescia and Spear were helping to shape a new image for Miami. That image was youthful, it was sexy, and, above all, it was modern.
That's the second important thing to know about Arquitectonica. As the first voice of its generation to make itself heard in major projects, the firm let it be known that post-modernism had peaked. The younger generation just wasn't picking up on it. Modern architecture, it turned out, hadn't come to an end with I. M. Pei. Indeed, in Arquitectonica's Bauhaus-does-the-rhumba version, modernism never looked livelier.
The firm's vision was evident in their first building, the Spear House, designed in 1977 for Ms. Spear's parents. Much used as a backdrop by fashion photographers in the late 1970's, this was a Bruce Weber photograph of a building: a lean, muscular structure that showed a lot of skin. With a blue swimming pool screened by a wall of glass blocks and pink stucco, the house fused the era's twin obsessions with voyeurism and flesh.
Arquitectonica were hardly the first to bring sensuality to modern design. In the 1930's, Latin American architects forged a sultry tropical version of the International Style. But for those who still equated modern buildings with bleak glass boxes and brutal concrete sheds, Arquitectonica's hedonistic update of Latin modernism came as a jolt, and not always a pleasant one.
I ONCE SAW FORT-BRESCIA DRIVE A student audience crazy with a presentation that dramatized how architecture could be at once esthetically progressive and socially hard to swallow. One project, a home for a Florida couple, had the students bouncing off the walls. It seemed that the couple enjoyed swimming together, but he liked to swim in fresh water while she liked to swim in sea water. The ingenious solution? A pair of serpentine pools that overlapped each other, I don't remember how, in a kind of acquatic duet. As I recall, there was also a third lane, for exotic fish. And the pool was to be outfitted with a glass bottom, so swimmers, peering down, could behold a temperature-controlled cellar of rare vintage wines.
Then followed the staggeringly beautiful Banco de Credito in Lima, Peru, with board rooms as glamorous as the sets for a 40's Hollywood musical and an oval entrance atrium that recalled the 1594 anatomical theater at the University of Padua. But those entering the atrium were more likely to be maimed than healed, for its function was to provide surveillance for terrorist attacks; the bank was not a beloved institution when the revolutionary group Shining Path was on the rampage. When a journalist friend of mine flew down to write about the building, she was alarmed to find that security guards, toting machine guns, were on hand to accompany her to the bank from her hotel. And she wasn't even making a deposit.
I had a similar experience two years ago when I went to write about Edison Terrace, a low-income housing project Arquitectonica had designed for the Liberty City neighborhood of Miami. The area had recently been in the news -- a tourist passing through had been dragged from her car and run over -- and the architects were reluctant to let me visit the building unless I agreed to be driven there by someone from their office and promised to stay in the car. Most architects who build in cities today have to deal with security issues, but somehow Arquitectonica's esthetic seems to capture this unsettling contemporary mixture of danger and glamour, eros and death.
Visitors to Times Square do not generally take bodyguards, despite the area's notoriety as a combat zone. But here a hazard is also likely to come from those who resent the whole 42d Street project and detest its sanitized razzmatazz. Those who relish the authentically seedy can hardly be expected to welcome the flag of Disney, the co-sponsor, raised over a street corner better known to viewers of the late-night "Robin Byrd Show."
Some wouldn't want to see Disney putting down roots in any part of town. To them, the company stands for theme parks, for fantasylands that are at once irresponsibly escapist and oppressively controlled. Do we want to welcome the arrival of that dubious formula within the city gates? Like it or not, it's here. And its arrival should provoke us to recognize that fantasy and control were shaping urban space long before Disney showed up.
It's odd the way we keep compulsively rubbing this spot, Times Square, as if the prurience it signifies had not escaped long ago into the atmosphere and filtered into the culture at large. The French writer Jean Baudrillard once theorized that the function of Disneyland is to keep Americans from seeing that their country is Disney land; the genuine imitations differ only in the accuracy of the simulation. Perhaps one reason we make such a fetish of "cleaning up" Times Square is that it diverts attention from the degree to which the entire culture has become eroticized.
It's hard to take cleaning up Times Square seriously with all those Calvin Klein billboard models bulging voluptuously at skyscraper scale. Still, the billboards help clarify the line between permissible and impermissible desire. What's taboo is not desire but its satisfaction. Consumer culture thrives on appetite; satisfaction makes the market wither. You can wear Calvin Klein's Escape, but you cannot escape Calvin Klein: cannot avoid the constant bombardment of images designed to keep us in a constant state of craving.
If we really wanted to clean up Times Square, we should probably start by banning skyscrapers, not building new ones. Is the city's indefatigable vertical thrust really suitable for viewing by children under 17? Arquitectonica's tower is not much naughtier than most. From some angles, the building will appear to be doing a strip, peeling back its glass skin to reveal the reveling of conventioneers. And that orgasmic 47-story light show should be a local landmark like no other. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, but an explosion of "pixie dust"? In Times Square?
THE ARCHITECTS HAVE DEscribed the project as a deliberate evocation of chaos. The eclectic mix of signs, styles and storefronts in the retail base, especially, is meant to look like a jumbled heap. One could interpret this on a purely cartoon level as the physical upheaval caused by the meteor's impact. Or, on a more sophisticated level of urbanism, one could view the jumble as a metaphor for the havoc unleashed by development in a city from which planning, for the most part, has all but disappeared.
I see this outstandingly smart design as a study in urban psychology. It seeks to visualize the forces that link private emotions and public space. The design's chaotic pileup of signs, stores and attractions are an invitation not just to consume, but to be hungry. I can think of no other recent work of architecture that pictures more accurately the disordered universe that desire brings in its wake.
This is the private universe, the life shaken up by the drives that bring people to the city, to connect with others, with destiny, with themselves. And it's the universe of the city itself, propelled through time by its unflagging willingness to sacrifice order to ambition.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Midtown Leasing;
After a Deluge of Deals, a Sudden Downturn

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
TALK about short-lived euphoria. After six months of frenzied leasing activity throughout midtown, the brakes are on the deal-making process. And landlords, brokers and tenants, most of whom had finally settled into the idea of a steadily recovering real estate market, are all trying to make sense of the unexpected downturn.
"We are definitely seeing less traffic coming through our buildings," said Douglas Durst, executive vice president of the Durst Organization. Another local landlord, who insisted on anonymity because he did not want to appear to be "negotiating from a position of weakness," was a lot more blunt. "This market is dead," he said. 
 Nor is it just a lull between the start of space searches and the closing of deals. "There definitely were fewer new assignments coming in in April, and that could certainly impact 1996," said Stephen B. Siegel, chief executive of the Edward S. Gordon real estate company.
The numbers certainly indicate a sickly market. According to the Gordon company, midtown activity peaked last October, when nearly 1.7 million square feet were leased. Activity remained comfortably above 1.3 million square feet a month for the next five months, too. Then, in April, it plunged to a piddling 815,000 square feet rented. And May is not looking much better.
The amount of space available is creeping up, too. According to RELocate, which tracks commercial leases, available space in midtown dropped at the end of 1994 and hit a low of 22.9 million square feet in January. Last month that number was back up to nearly 24 million square feet. The amount of available sublet space, meanwhile, has moved up and down between 4.5 million and 5 million square feet since November.
"The sublet situation is not as glaring, but available direct space is inching up," said Bruce Weissberg, RELocate's president.
So why the slump?
As with most real estate subjects, different players offer widely divergent rationales. But many agree that the boomlet of the last six to eight months was as much a result of smoke and mirrors as of genuine recovery. They note that many tenants had waited until the 11th hour to sign new leases, hoping rents would continue to plummet, then simply ran out of time and had to make deals. Others reacted to the first whiff of a stabilizing market as though it were their last chance to lock in bargain rents, and rushed to find new space or agree to early renewals on existing leases.
NOW the pent-up demand has been pretty well satisfied. "Up until the end of last year we could concentrate on renewing tenants," said Alan L. Stein, a senior vice president of Rockefeller Center Management. "Now we have to bring in new tenants, new blood." It is not easy, he has discovered: As of April 30, about 7.3 percent of the space in Rockefeller Center was empty; a year ago the vacancy rate was only 3.3 percent.
(Two weeks ago, in a development related more to depressed rents than to vacancy rates, the partnerships that own 12 of the Rockefeller Center buildings filed for protection under the Bankruptcy Code.)
The downturn isn't causing widespread doom and gloom -- yet. "Last year was an aberration, a feeding frenzy, and all that's happened is we're back to a normal pace," said Mr. Siegel. "Sure, if we have three months of just 800,000 square feet leased, I'll be upset, but I don't think that will happen."
Neither does Joseph G. Costabile, an executive director of Cushman & Wakefield. "Yes, April and May have been quiet, but I think it's temporary," he said. "The residential market is booming, the stock market is fine, and there's not that much space available." Mr. Costabile expects that the traditional summer slowdown (conspicuously absent last year) just hit early.
Others say that the current slowdown signifies nothing more than the market digesting the remnants of a heavy meal.
"Last year represented the culmination of a lot of deals that had been circling the market for several years prior," said Mitchell S. Steir, an executive vice president with the Julien J. Studley brokerage. "Now the market needs to digest those deals and move sideways for a while. There's a limit to how many record years you can have."
Of course, if landlords would drop rents again, tenants might rush back to market. When Edward Minskoff was asking for an annual rent of about $50 a square foot at 590 Madison Avenue, the old I.B.M. building at 56th Street that he bought last year, he got only one taker, BHF-Bank, a German bank. Now, brokers report, he has dropped his price to the $40's, and a very large tenant is considering a 200,000-square-foot-plus deal.
But few landlords are similarly ready to drop prices. Most of those who survived the recession are presiding over buildings that are fairly full and that have cash flows that cover operating expenses and debt service. Financially, they do not need to rent every last drop of space; psychologically, they do not want to backtrack to the time when they had to do so.
"It took so long and was so painful to climb out of the last hole, and none of us have the huge amount of available space we had a few years ago," Mr. Durst said. "Our attitude is that we can wait it out."
When tenants have that attitude as well, the result is stalemate. Mr. Durst recently tried to negotiate an early renewal of a lease with one tenant whose rent had escalated to $38 a foot in a building where the going rent now is about $30 a foot. Mr. Durst was willing to split the difference, and set a rent in the mid-$30's. The tenant opted instead to wait out the two years left on its lease, and decide later if it wants to stay or move.
"It doesn't pay for a tenant to give up flexibility to save just a few dollars in rent," Mr. Durst said.
FLEXIBILITY has grown particularly important to those tenants who are suffering their own economic disappointments. Many companies that were thinking about expanding when the recovery began are now hunkering down for another spate of difficult times.
"As recently as last quarter, tenants were still investigating their options, looking around, focusing attention on real estate," said James S. Meiskin, president of the Plymouth Partners brokerage. "Now they have to focus single-mindedly on their basic businesses."
This is particularly true in financial services. "So many of the investment banks are reporting losses, or at least earnings that are off," noted Bruce E. Mosler, chief executive of the Galbreath Company, a real estate service firm. Mr. Mosler predicts that leasing activity in the second half of 1995 will be flat at best, and that 1996 will be a "decent but slow-growth year." His reason: "As the financial services industry goes, so goes New York."
Perhaps the only truly upbeat people around are the investors -- and thus, the sales brokers. While sales of residential buildings have slowed down, brokers report that commercial sales remain brisk.
"Investors still feel the city's economy is viable," said Daun Paris, president of Eastern Consolidated Properties, a real estate-oriented investment bank.
Foreign investors, particularly, are attracted by the prices, said Scott Latham, Eastern Consolidated's executive director. Mr. Latham said there is "tremendous interest" in 535-545 Fifth Avenue, adjoining buildings at 44th Street that Eastern has put on the market for about $130 a square foot.
"That's not only reasonable for Fifth Avenue north of 42d Street, but it is incredibly cheap compared to the prices in Hong Kong or Tokyo," he said.
And there are pockets of vibrancy even in commercial leasing. The entertainment industry, for one, continues to rent more space. Brokers report that Sony, Time Warner and Viacom, all of which have rented space of late, are looking for more.
Still, few real estate experts expect the slump to end very soon. "I've been advising my landlords to make the best deals they can make now, because I think '96 will be a slower year than '95," said Mr. Costabile.
Mr. Durst agreed. "This slump will last another year or year and a half," he said. "We won't see a big decline in rents, but we won't see a lot of leasing activity, either."

HEADLINE: For Home Buyers, Patience Has Paid Off

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
INTEREST rates are falling. Interest rates are falling. It's a mantra being intoned by almost every real estate broker, mortgage banker and potential home buyer these days. And unlike other industry slogans -- like "now is a good time to buy" or "prices are rising" -- this one is unarguable, at least for now.
The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages in the New York metropolitan area has plunged in the last few months, dropping more than a full percentage point to 8.06 as of last Wednesday from its recent high of 9.39 percent on Dec. 16, according to HSH Associates, a mortgage research company in Butler, N.J. That means that anyone who simply waited five months to buy a home with a fixed-rate mortgage may have saved, before taxes, $95 a month on a $100,000 mortgage; the payments would have dropped to $738 from $833. Rates on adjustable-rate mortgages also have dropped -- but not as much. The average interest rate on a one-year A.R.M. in the New York metropolitan area fell to 5.69 as of last Wednesday from its recent high of 6.54 percent on Jan. 13, according to HSH Associates. That means the average monthly payment for a new A.R.M. fell $55 on a $100,000 loan, to $580 from $635. 
 "Patience has indeed paid off for a lot of people," said Keith T. Gumbinger, an analyst with HSH Associates, adding that rates were slightly higher for co-ops and some condominiums.
Considering the favorable trends in interest rates, it may seem to be a bit of a conundrum, then, that the real estate market remains so weak.
Projections by the National Association of Realtors for this year's total sales, based on first-quarter figures, declined in New York (by 10.3 percent), in New Jersey (by 8.1 percent) and in Connecticut (by 0.6 percent). And the median sale price of existing homes in the New York region fell 3.5 percent from $173,200 last year to $167,200 for the first three months of this year.
Interest rates, however, generally reflect demand for loans -- not the other way around. For example, in the mid-80's, when a surging demand for housing pushed residential real estate prices through the roof, mortgage rates for both fixed and adjustable rates had double digits and, for fixed-rate loans, the suffix "-teen" applied in some years.
Thus lower interest rates may provide a good opportunity for home buyers -- and anyone considering refinancing an existing mortgage. They are not, though, necessarily positive indicators of the health of the real estate market. Indeed, when rates hit their 20-year lows in the fall of 1993, the increase in resales and home appreciation was, generally, lackluster, although refinancings increased tremendously.
"Refinancings are almost strictly driven by interest rates, but the interest rates are only part of the picture in rest of the housing market," Mr. Gumbinger said.
He noted that buyers might not be stampeding into the market because rates have not collapsed to the 25-year lows that existed just 18 to 24 months ago, when fixed-rate mortgages were as low as 7 percent, and A.R.M.'s had teaser or special low-ball promotional rates as low as 3 percent.
Buyers, he speculated, also may be more likely to enter the market when rates start to rise (to try to beat further increases) and they may delay buying when rates are declining (to wait until rates hit bottom).
Mr. Gumbinger noted that there was a lack of affordable starter homes in the New York region, too, and that that was the market niche with the highest demand.
"PEOPLE can't find what they want at a price they want, so they don't buy," he said. "And the people who have the homes to sell bought them at such high prices that they can't afford to lower them below a certain point. So they don't sell, which means they can't trade up, which means the trade-up's can trade-up again, and it becomes a cycle."
There are, of course, other factors, like consumer confidence, demographic changes and job formation at play in the market for first mortgages. And these factors, according to economists, are neutral or negative in much of the New York region.
"The biggest problem with New York, and to a lesser extent New Jersey, is that we are not getting the job formation," said Rae D. Rosen, a senior economist with the Federal Reserve Board in New York. "So, if you don't have job growth, particularly upper-income level job growth, people are going to be reluctant to purchase homes or to trade up."
She estimated that, according to surveys of realtor groups, home sales had declined about 5 to 10 percent over the last year, and that prices might have dropped by as much as 10 percent.
"Things were improving, then in about June of last year, job formation stopped, and we hit a brick wall," she said. "People in the city, city employees in particular, are worried about losing their jobs or losing pay. And that means they are not going to be buying homes."
Ms. Rosen added that a more ominous sign might be that the size of New York's labor force was actually declining slightly, not just increasing slowly.
"It may be because of out-migration, or people have just given up looking for work," Ms. Rosen said. "Either way, it's not good. It's an indicator that the economy is weak -- but it's not collapsing. For the private sector, we are probably bouncing along a trough, and for the public sectors we have more cuts ahead."
"This is not true, though, in New Jersey, because they have had a high level of immigration," she added. "That's one of the factors."
The weak economy is often attributed to the Fed's decision to raise short-term interest rates seven times between February 1994 and February of this year to cap what it believed to be growing inflationary pressures.
The higher short-term rates made it more costly to borrow, which may have snuffed out inflation for the time being. They also, however, stunted, if not aborted, an economic recovery that began nationally in late 1992 but did not get under way in the New York region until early last year or late 1993.
"THE Fed's raising of interest rates seven times last year may have had a negative impact on consumer confidence as well as some big employer layoffs," said Carl DeMusz, president of the New Jersey Association of Realtors. "We also expected first-quarter sales this year to be lower than in '94 because last year's resales were at the second-highest quarterly level for that time period of all time."
In recent months, interest rates have started to recede because of a widespread belief in the bond market that the Fed has stopped raising short-term rates and may even, sensing that inflation is no longer a significant danger, lower rates to head off a recession. (Others, of course, are not so optimistic. They believe the Fed may again raise rates either because of new signs of inflation or because of the weak dollar in Japan and Germany.)
This interplay with the bond market may sound arcane, but it is important because interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages usually track in the same direction as the interest rate on the 30-year Treasury bond, or long bond as it is sometimes called. (The rate on the long bond had fallen to 6.85 percent on Wednesday from a recent of high of 8.25 percent on Nov. 7, the day before Election Day.)
The interest rate that lenders charge on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is not linked directly to the long bond, however, at least not in the manner that some adjustable-rate mortgages are pegged to short-term Treasury rates with the lender adding on a premium.
Instead, the rate on fixed-rate 30-year mortgages is usually developed by the secondary market -- Government-sponsored enterprises like Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Fannie Mae, the Federal National Mortgage Association -- which buys mortgages from lenders and essentially set the lending standards.
These buyers in the secondary market offer to pay a certain interest rate on certain types of fixed-rate mortgages after weighing the likelihood of inflation over the next seven years; homes are usually sold or mortgages refinanced within seven years. (They also, to be sure, consider the likelihood of default and other risk characteristics.)
Then originating lenders -- institutions like a local savings-and-loan or a mortgage banker -- pass along to borrowers the secondary-market rates with a premium of about three-eighths of a percentage point for their profit, loan servicing and administration.
(This rate rate may also be "discounted" or reduced if the borrower prepays interest on the mortgage by paying up front what are commonly known as "points." A point is equal to 1 percent of the loan's total value. Rates and premiums may be higher for so-called jumbo mortgages, which are loans over $200,000, and nonconforming mortgages, which are often loans to borrowers with credit problems.)
"All of these things explain the spread -- right now it's about 1.2 points -- between the rate on the 30-year bond and a 30-year mortgage," said Mr. Gumbinger of HSH Associates. "There is a slight additional risk."
Adjustable-rate mortgages haven't declined as much as fixed-rate mortgages over the last five months simply because they are pegged to short-term Treasuries, which haven't declined as much long-term Treasury bonds. A.R.M. rates are usually the rate for the one-year Treasury security plus a premium of about 2.75 percent, not taking into consideration discounting, points or teaser rates, which are artificially low rates for the first year and are sometimes even lower than the Treasury security rate with no premium attached.
(Some A.R.M.'s, particularly those that adjust monthly, every 90 days or every 180 days, are linked to other short-term rates, like the less volatile London Interbank Offering Rate, or Libor, or the 11th District Federal Home Loan Bank's cost of funds index, known as Cofi.)
PREDICTABLY, home buyers have reacted to the greater decline in fixed-rate mortgage rates by buying more fixed-rate loans. In March -- the most recent month for which data is available from the Federal Housing Finance Board in Washington -- 56 percent of all the home loans made had fixed rates. By comparison, in January only 41 percent of home buyers took out fixed-rate loans. (The figures for A.R.M.'s includes hybrids, mortgages that are fixed for several years and then adjust.)
Mr. Gumbinger also noted that the spread between the lowest A.R.M available and the average fixed-rate mortgage had shrunk from 5 to 5.5 percentage points, which is an unusually wide gap, last fall to about 3 percentage points today. "The low end of the A.R.M.'s has closed up considerably, mostly because of the rise in short-term rates, related to the Fed's moves," Mr. Gumbinger said. "Basically, lenders couldn't afford to give away the store anymore."
"Generally, when rates go up you can expect people to buy more A.R.M.'s," he added. "And when rates go down, they'll buy more fixed. They want to lock in the low rate and get rid of some of the risk. When rates are high, they go with the A.R.M. just because it's cheaper."
The declining rates have also started to spark a small outburst of refinancings, but the numbers are still small -- about 10 percent of all mortgage originations, according to HSH Associates. In 1992 and 1993, when rates were 1 to 2 percentage points lower, refinancings made up as much as 70 percent of mortgage originations.
"We are starting to see people who want to do it, and we are getting a lot of calls from people inquiring," said Bruce R. Lublin, president of Homerica Mortgage Corporation in Mamaroneck, N.Y. "The rates aren't quite low enough yet to spark anything like what we saw a few years ago, though."
Maybe not, but they are low -- very low -- by historic standards. The current average A.R.M. rate of 5.69 percent is not substantially higher than the all-time low of 4.15 percent on Oct. 29, 1993; A.R.M.s have only really been around since 1980. Moreover, the current average fixed-rate mortgage of 8.06 percent is not much above the 6.87 percent that it fell to on Oct. 15, 1993, and that marked the lowest point in fixed rates since 1965.
The recent decline in both fixed and adjustable rates came as surprise to most mortgage-market watchers. A year ago, when the Fed was in the midst of increasing rates and inflation seemed to be looming, many economists predicted that fixed-rate mortgages might be as high as 10 percent by now.
ANALYSTS are divided on whether rates will fall much further or start to rise again. Should rates rise, the impact on the resale market, which dwarfs the new home market in the New York area, would almost certainly be negative. If they fall, though, the impact may be less substantial than expected, though far from not negligible.
Again, other factors are at least as important, if not more so. "People are very hesitant to enter into their most significant financial commitment without a certain degree of long-term job stability," said Charles M. Staro, executive vice president of the New York State Association of Realtors.
Mr. Gumbinger speculated that demographics could become a dominant factor in the years ahead, as they were in the 70's and 80's. He noted that in 5 or 10 years, many baby boomers would start to become empty-nesters and would likely look to sell the large, multi-bedroom houses in which they raised families.
This could mean, he said, that a wave of baby boomers will try to sell their homes all at the same time (to a smaller cohort that will likely be buying homes even later than their parents did) and depress prices -- much as they all bought homes at the same time and helped make prices rise 10 and 20 years ago.
In the nearer term, though, there is some degree of optimism that home resale volume in the second quarter, which is the prime home-buying season, will benefit from the lower interest rates.
"With the weather warming up and interest rates at attractive levels, we expect this year's second quarter to bounce back," said Mr. DeMusz of the New Jersey Association of Realtors.

HEADLINE: CAMPUS LIFE;
When the Office Park Becomes a White Elephant

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: WAYNE

 BODY:
If the American Cyanamid site here is eventually put on the market, it will join a growing roster of corporate campuses waiting for another user.
"In the New York area, these campuses are expensive to run, the taxes are unbelievable and everyone's looking to downsize," said Rick Gelmetti, senior vice president with Weichert Commercial Realtors in Morris Plains. 
 No one is sure how many of New Jersey's sprawling corporate campuses -- loosely defined as sites of 60 acres or more -- are either unoccupied or available.
But officials from Senior Campus Living in Baltimore say they have visited about 30 such sites in northern New Jersey -- some still operating, like American Cyanamid, and some defunct, like the I.B.M. property in Franklin Lakes -- with the idea of turning them into self-contained retirement communities for 2,000 or more elderly people.
These sites are not always easy to find, because having a defunct corporate campus is not exactly something businesses like to advertise.
"It's really sensitive," said Fred Walker, vice president of acquisitions for Senior Campus Living. "With some of these companies, they're still in business and they're not sure what they're going to do."
But it is growing more and more apparent that the days of the vast corporate campus may be ending.
Robert G. McCafferty, senior vice president of the Garibaldi Group, a corporate real estate firm in Chatham, says many campuses were born in the speculative building boom that followed the sharp rise, then equally steep drop, in interest rates in the early 1980's.
Developers built office parks without specific tenants in mind. When the economy soured, companies were forced to cut costs -- and one way they did was to try to sell off their suburban corporate parks.
Now the towns saddled with abandoned campuses, like I.B.M.'s in Franklin Lakes, are trying to figure out what should be done with them.
"We have seen a movement toward adaptive re-use," said Andrew J. Merin, a senior director of Cushman & Wakefield of New Jersey Inc. "We're seeing towns, under the pressure of taxes, that are more open to zoning changes."
Similarly, officials in Wayne are looking at the Cyanamid campus with an eye to the future.
"In this economic climate, just by the mere fact that there is so much office space available in New Jersey, it's going to be hard to sell that building out, lease it, rent it out," said Councilman Scott Rumana. "To fill it with a company for its present use is going to be virtually impossible, at best, very, very difficult." DAVID W. CHEN

HEADLINE: The View From: New London;
Another Marine Attraction Vies for Waterfront Attention

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
PILES of rubble littering a 24-acre peninsula on New London's shoreline will soon be cleared to make way for Ocean Quest, a $41 million center devoted to the study of the sea.
The Ocean Quest marine sciences camp and oceanography museum lies at the center of New London's plans for economic revival. The brick mill buildings that once stood on the waterfront site, known as the New London Mills property, have been torn down. In their place, a 150-room Marriott Hotel and an 87,500-square-foot center, which includes an amphitheater, will be built during the first phase of construction. The second phase consists of a 360-degree theater, exhibition areas and expansion of the learning center. A whaling village with shops is scheduled for the third phase. Plans also include a restaurant and cafeteria, conference rooms, a waterfront park, a dock and moorings. Construction is expected to start this spring, and opening day is planned for July 4, 1996. The venture is to be financed with a $2.4 million state grant and private support, said Philip J. Slack III, a director of the project. 
 The marine sciences camp and museum, to be situated at the mouth of the Thames River, will be another link in a chain of attractions that promote southeastern Connecticut's maritime history and marine science resources. Proposals have been made to renovate and expand Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, improve Mystic Seaport, develop the Thames River Maritime Heritage Park in New London and expand the marine sciences center at the University of Connecticut's Avery Point campus.
"I look at Ocean Quest as another major tourist destination. We hope people will buy package tickets to all the region's activities," Mr. Slack said.
Modeled after the Space Camp and the Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Ala., Ocean Quest will use hands-on devices, computer graphics, animation, video and simulation to teach visitors about the ocean and undersea technology. Students at the Ocean Quest Learning Center will attend one of three overnight camps. And tourists visiting exhibitions at the Ocean Science Center will learn about everything from ocean environments and undersea experiments to discoveries in the oceans.
Campers will learn what it feels like to be aboard a submarine by operating two simulators donated by the Navy. The simulators, formerly used by Navy trainees, replicate a submarine control room. The Navy has also agreed to give Ocean Quest steering and diving training equipment it no longer needs, Mr. Slack said. Teams of campers will be given missions to complete aboard the simulator, ones like traveling to the Arctic to map the thickness and contours of the ice. As the simulator is moved, computer-generated displays will show the undersea world.
Ocean Quest will take advantage of nearby resources, including the USS Nautilus Museum and the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in New London. In addition, Jean-Michel Cousteau, son of Jacques Cousteau, and Edward Buckbee, founder and director of Space Camp in Alabama, have agreed to act as consultants.
The exhibitions and camp are expected to draw about 330,000 visitors during the first year of operation and create an estimated 300 full-time jobs and another 80 part-time positions, Mr. Slack said. Displaced military-contract workers with technical skills will be needed in the development of programs. Students and teachers at local schools will also be hired to work on curriculum and in other areas, Mr. Slack said.
Mr. Slack and another director, Michael O'Donnell, formerly Navy sonar technicians, were managers at Analysis and Technology Inc., a military contractor in North Stonington, before resigning to work full time on Ocean Quest. The New London Citizens Council approached Analysis and Technology early in 1992 with an idea for a tourist attraction using a display of surplus Navy training equipment. When the company decided not to pursue the project, Mr. Slack and Mr. O'Donnell took it over. Although they had no experience as real estate developers, they were able to convince local legislators, city officials and state grant administrators that Ocean Quest could create jobs and income for southeastern Connecticut.
The work Mr. Slack and Mr. O'Donnell have done promoting their project has paid off. Ocean Quest has won acceptance throughout the community, the director of development and planning for New London, Peter D. Gillespie, said. "There has been overwhelming support for the project, which you don't say all the time," Mr. Gillespie said. "New London has been a working waterfront community. Tourism hasn't been something the city has marketed. It's been overlooked."
"From a historical point of view, it's a perfect fit," said Vivian Stanley, director of Mystic and More, a regional tourism agency. "If you look at the Thames River, starting with the clipper ships and ending with submarines, you have this wonderful history of the water."
Ms. Stanley said she was not concerned that other entertainment in the region would draw tourists away from Ocean Quest. While Mystic Seaport attracts high-income tourists, and the earnings of patrons at Foxwoods High Stakes and Bingo Casino are lower, Ocean Quest's market is in between, Ms. Stanley said.
New London would not have to make major street changes or deal with traffic as heavy as the stream of cars that travel through Ledyard to Foxwoods, Mr. Gillespie said. "The good thing about this location is that you can get to Ocean Quest by using several different routes," he said, "and the traffic is broken up."
On a summer weekend day, 1,860 cars might travel through New London on their way to Ocean Quest, said Mr. Gillespie, quoting from a traffic study. Tourists would follow signs from Interstate 95, 395 and Route 32 through the downtown to Ocean Quest on Pequot Avenue. Downtown businesses would benefit when tourists stop along the way, Mr. Slack said.
People would be able to visit several places in New London and take a boat across the river to sites in Groton, Mr. Gillespie said. The goal for Mystic and More is to persuade vacationers to spend a couple of days visiting the places that make the region an educational type of destination, Ms. Stanley said. "Ocean Quest is part of that cluster," she added.
Ocean Quest appears to symbolize a nationwide trend of disappearing manufacturing plants and flourishing service industries. The buildings on the New London Mills property, which at different times included a textile mill, a printing press plant and a linoleum factory, will be replaced by a sleek building of glass and steel housing high-technology exhibits. "Southeastern Connecticut has a lot of natural reasons why tourism is a big industry," said a spokesman for the state Department of Economic Development, Joseph M. Cohen.
"That's not something that should be avoided. With manufacturing jobs shriveling across the country, you can't force manufacturing to happen."

HEADLINE: Tall Timber And the E.P.A.

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
YOU are a multibillion-dollar corporation and Federal regulators are sniffing suspiciously at your factories, building a case that your industry has broadly violated the country's environmental laws.
What to do? 
 Your lawyers' guesses about which side might prevail if the case ends up in court are just that -- guesses. You could pre-empt the Feds by volunteering to install pollution gear, but that might cost tens of millions of dollars and raise the price of your product.
And what happens if one of your competitors plays hardball with regulators, or goes to Congress for a legislative fix, and doesn't have to put on the expensive control equipment? No company wants to be tarred in the press as an environmental villain. But there are also dangers in capitulating too easily, and becoming known as a pushover for any Federal regulator looking for a patsy.
Three of the nation's largest wood products companies found themselves pondering this Rubik's cube of uncertainties and risks in the early 1990's, when the Environmental Protection Agency began a nationwide investigation of the industry. Although they make similar products at comparable factories, they chose very different courses, and the outcome remains much in doubt.
The Weyerhaeuser Company, of Tacoma, Wash., took the most conciliatory approach, agreeing to put tens of millions of dollars of controls on its plants before the E.P.A. brought its case. It paid more than $1.5 million in fines to state authorities, but is still arguing with Federal officials over whether it should pay further penalties. The company does not disagree with the E.P.A. estimate of how much pollution its wood products plants give off.
The Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, based in Portland, Ore., paid an $11 million Federal fine and pledged to install more than $70 million in pollution-control equipment a few months after the E.P.A. served notice of possible Clean Air Act violations.
The Georgia-Pacific Corporation of Atlanta has been the most pugnacious. It disputes the scientific and legal foundations of the Government's case, says the E.P.A. estimates of its pollution are overstated and has argued that the agency is unfairly applying present-day standards to decisions made 10 to 15 years ago. Last November, the company fired off a blistering, 243-page response to the E.P.A. that dismissed the agency's allegations as "difficult to fathom" and "extraordinarily stale."
This year, Georgia-Pacific took the fight to Capitol Hill and persuaded the new Republican majority on the Senate Judiciary Committee to approve an amendment that derails the pending E.P.A. investigation. According to Clinton Administration officials and Weyerhaeuser, the measure could allow Georgia-Pacific to avoid installing pollution gear at many of its plants.
All three companies defend their strategies. But in an unusual, high-stakes lobbying battle, Weyerhaeuser executives are now working hard on Capitol Hill to undo Georgia-Pacific's legislative success. The amendment at issue is part of Senator Bob Dole's regulatory reform bill, which will come before the Senate for a vote later this year.
Weyerhaeuser fears that if the amendment stands, it will wind up at a disadvantage. Operating costs at plants with the controls, company executives say, are $1 million a year higher, and when the lumber market goes into a cyclical downturn, as it does every few years, that extra cost could mean the difference between closing a marginal mill and keeping it open.
Georgia-Pacific executives have said they are going to Congress just as any citizen would do to redress an injustice. Moreover, they say, studies by company consultants suggest that the current E.P.A. test method overstates the emissions from wood products factories. Nonetheless, they said they would install controls at plants that need them.
Lee Thomas, a former E.P.A. Administrator who is now a senior executive at the company, said the case was an instance in which E.P.A. enforcement officials had "stretched beyond where they should be going."
But Sara Shreiner Kendall, Weyerhaeuser's director of environmental affairs, said her company's own studies confirmed the E.P.A. view of how much pollution was going into the air, and the need for controls at such factories. The legislation at issue, which was slipped into Senator Dole's bill more or less as Georgia-Pacific drafted it, "sends exactly the wrong signal," she said. "We're finding ourselves in the position of being penalized for coming into compliance. We think that's unfair."
Such an open split between Fortune 500 rivals in the same industry is an unusual spectacle -- even for Washington. It stems directly from the companies' differing tactics for dealing with Federal regulators and for maximizing returns for shareholders.
Those differences, industry analysts and environmental lawyers say, are not surprising. Dealing with the Government's environmental enforcement officials poses the most subjective, and most uncertain, of business decisions. The laws are among the most arcane in the statute book, and subject to varying interpretations. Many times, basic technical facts are in dispute, even among independent scientists. And shifting politics in Washington further cloud the picture.
Companies like Georgia-Pacific and Weyerhaeuser, with far-reaching business empires, also have to worry about whether a pitched battle over one case will generally sour relations with Federal regulators who have vast powers to issue permits and begin investigations year-in, year-out.
There are also the vagaries of public relations. "Even if you win, you can lose by being tarred as a bad corporate player by the Government," said Mark Rogers, a paper and forest products analyst at Prudential Securities. "Everybody would always like to 'get it behind them,' but the question is always: at what cost?"
THE E.P.A. has been wrestling with how to regulate the wood products industry for more than a decade. In the early 1980's, the agency considered imposing limits on the emissions at all new plywood mills, but dropped the effort because of technical difficulties in measuring the pollutants and because the industry was losing money.
Air pollution is an inevitable byproduct of manufacturing plywood and other wood products. At the mills, logs are peeled and sliced into veneer or smaller chips. Then, the green wood is dried at high temperatures before being glued and pressed together. Most emissions come from the dryer.
The E.P.A. focused on what are called volatile organic compounds, or V.O.C.'s, substances that can combine with nitrogen oxides from car exhausts and other sources to form smog. The V.O.C.'s waft skyward when the water, sap and other juices in wood are vaporized by heat.
The agency's retreat from imposing new emission limits did not mean the companies were off the hook when it came to V.O.C.'s. Under the 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act, companies operating in regions with the cleanest air -- like the forested areas in which most plywood and waferboard mills are situated -- must undergo stringent review. They have to apply for permits from state or Federal agencies if they build new plants that emit more than 250 tons a year of V.O.C.'s or other key pollutants. Permits are also required for any modification of an existing plant that increases emissions of these compounds by more than 40 tons a year. Companies applying for permits can be ordered to install expensive pollution-control technologies.
As the economy roared back to life in the mid-1980's, and homebuilding took off, the plywood and wood products industry revived with it. New mills were built, primarily in the South, and old ones expanded. Managers had to estimate their plants' emissions and decide whether to apply for permits.
Many companies and states, which typically administer the permit programs, turned to an E.P.A. document known as AP-42 that provides formulas for industries to calculate emissions. The section on emissions by plywood dryers was based on a study by Washington State University. For reasons that remain unclear, one of the numbers in this section was incorrect; as a result, anyone using the table to calculate the emissions, the E.P.A. now argues, would end up with a number roughly one-tenth what it should have been.
In 1983, the research arm of the wood products industry published a report that said plywood dryers were emitting pollution at much higher levels than what was set out in the E.P.A. document. The National Council of the Paper Industry for Air and Stream Improvement, a group financed by the pulp and paper industry, included the higher figures in its Technical Bulletin 405.
Charles Simon, a chief researcher in the industry's study, said he described the bulletin's findings to regional meetings of plywood company executives. Copies of the bulletin, he said, were mailed to the research departments of all the major companies and to scientists at the E.P.A.
Mr. Simon, who is now a consultant to the Government in its continuing investigation of the industry, said it was inconceivable that the companies' top scientists would have been unaware of the research arm's test results. If companies had used them to estimate their plants' emissions, many of the new or expanded mills of the 1980's would have been applying for permits under the Clean Air Act.
That didn't happen. Instead, the E.P.A. republished the AP-42 document, with the mistake, in 1984, 1987 and 1991, and company executives used it to justify not applying for permits. In using the E.P.A.'s erroneous formula, Mr. Simon said, "the industry was taking advantage of a regulatory agency's lack of knowledge. That's crystal clear to me."
In a telephone interview, Mr. Simon said he was reluctant at first to join the Government's side -- and take on his friends and colleagues in the wood products industry -- but changed his mind after reading Georgia-Pacific's vehement opposition to the E.P.A.'s case. Mr. Simon said he became increasingly upset as he read what he felt was a distorted, inaccurate account of the industry's ignorance of V.O.C. emissions in the 1980's. He said company executives appeared to be "thumbing their noses at the regulators."
EIGHT years after the industry's study of V.O.C.'s was published, the E.P.A. decided to investigate the wood products industry. It began with suspicions about a single company, Louisiana-Pacific, which had been hit with a scattering of local pollution actions.
By 1991, the company had grabbed nearly half of the growing market for waferboard, a plywood substitute made from wafers of wood glued and pressed together.
Many of the company's plants had been built without controls for V.O.C.'s because Louisiana-Pacific estimated the emissions as being less than 250 tons annually.
E.P.A. officials had their doubts about the level of V.O.C.'s and other pollutants and decided to open an investigation.
As they reviewed documents and tested the company's dryers and presses, E.P.A. officials began to conclude that Louisiana-Pacific had understated its emissions, sometimes by thousands of tons a year. E.P.A. officials widened the inquiry to other companies and other segments of the wood products industry, including plywood and particle board.
The agency sent requests for information to Georgia-Pacific, Weyerhaeuser and seven other companies. And in July 1992, the E.P.A. served notice on Louisiana-Pacific of possible violations of the Clean Air Act at eight plants. Six other plants were added later.
Soon after, the company began to talk seriously about striking a deal with the Government. In a settlement announced by the Clinton Administration in May 1993, the company paid an $11 million civil penalty -- the largest in the history of the Clean Air Act -- and pledged to install $70 million in pollution control equipment. More than 9,000 tons of volatile organic compounds that the company plants had been belching into the atmosphere would now be incinerated before they could escape.
The company signed a consent decree in which it admitted no wrongdoing. But court papers filed in the case by the Government accused the company of concealing its emissions in several instances.
Carol Browner, the E.P.A. Administrator, and Janet Reno, the Attorney General, held a news conference in which they triumphantly declared the Government had sent a "loud and clear message" to polluters.
Louisiana-Pacific executives declined to give interviews for this article or explain why they were so quick to settle. Industry analysts noted that the deal came at a time of a booming market in wood products. The company, they said, may well have feared the E.P.A. would use its ultimate sanction: shutting down the plants while the case was pending.
After the announcement, Louisiana-Pacific executives were disappointed at how the news media portrayed the case. Harry A. Merlo, the company's chairman, complained in a letter to shareholders that press accounts had "zeroed in on the fine we were required to pay and ignored the joint nature of the agreement and the environmental advances we will pioneer."
WEYERHAEUSER knew it had a problem even before the E.P.A. began its investigation, but the company said it was unaware of the mistake in the AP-42 document.
Ms. Kendall, the company's director of environmental affairs, disputes the E.P.A.'s theory that the industry intentionally disregarded its own 1983 study of V.O.C. emissions. Interviews with present and former company employees, she said, turned up no evidence that anyone had deliberately used the E.P.A.'s erroneous formula to understate a plant's pollution.
Instead, she says, Weyerhaeuser stumbled on the problem in August 1991, when a test at the company's waferboard plant in Elkin, N.C., found startlingly high V.O.C. emissions: A rate of 1,000 tons a year, 10 times what the company had reported to state authorities.
A second test confirmed the results, and Ms. Kendall asked one of the company's scientists how many other Weyerhaeuser mills might be in similar straits. He came back with a list of at least a dozen.
"At that point," she said, "we realized we had a big problem."
As Ms. Kendall viewed it, environmental law relies on what is, essentially, an honor system. Companies have the chief responsibility for understanding their own processes and figuring out how much they pollute. Ignorance is not much of a defense. After the Elkin test results were in, Ms. Kendall said, the company had little choice but to look at all its operations and see if they were similarly polluting.
"We felt if we sat on the information we had, we could expose ourselves to a risk of criminal prosecution," she recalled.
In April 1992, the company began to test all of its wood products plants. Many of them were emitting more than 250 tons a year of V.O.C.'s, and did not have the appropriate permits.
Weyerhaeuser executives weighed the pros and cons of the matter. While there were no "slam dunk" legal arguments, Ms. Kendall said, the confusing technical situation and the E.P.A.'s own inaccurate formula in AP-42 gave the company some legs to stand on. But ultimately, she said, Weyerhaeuser's senior management felt it would be better to come forward, voluntarily install controls and adopt a "pro-active" stance that might persuade Federal officials not to file a case.
Weyerhaeuser told state officials about the V.O.C. findings and applied for Clean Air Act permits, a step that meant installing new control equipment. It also asked state officials to impose fines for the violations, in the hopes of heading off citizens' lawsuits and Federal action. Ms. Kendall said some states were reluctant to impose fines because they did not view the violations as significant.
William Ruckelshaus, a former E.P.A. Administrator who serves on the Weyerhaeuser board, sounded out William K. Reilly, the head of the agency at the time, about the company's approach. Ms. Kendall said the reply was encouraging.
A few weeks later, Weyerhaeuser was startled to receive a letter from E.P.A. enforcement officials requesting information that might be used in an enforcement action. Over the next few months, Weyerhaeuser appealed to the E.P.A. not to go forward with an enforcement case, but agency officials told the company they were required, by law, to recoup the economic benefit the company had gained by operating without controls. That meant filing a civil case, and seeking fines.
Weyerhaeuser has countered that fines are inappropriate because, it says, it reaped no benefits. Nonetheless, last August, the E.P.A. served notice of possible violations at nine Weyerhaeuser plants, the first step toward a civil suit.
The case is pending, even as the company installs pollution control gear and seeks permits. Federal officials have not decided whether to file a civil suit and seek fines.
"We felt we owned some of this problem," Ms. Kendall said, "but we don't feel that we should be penalized when everyone -- the states, the companies and the Federal Government -- contributed to this mutual mistake."
AT Georgia-Pacific, executives were analyzing similar facts and reaching vastly different conclusions.
Gordon Alphonso, senior counsel, said that beginning in 1992, the company took a close look at the foundations of the E.P.A.'s case, and saw a string of dubious assumptions as well as an inappropriate attempt to apply new rules retroactively.
Mr. Alphonso noted that different states had different definitions of what constituted a volatile organic compound. The E.P.A. itself, he said, was never able to agree on what test method should be used. State and Federal officials reviewed, and approved, all of the company's decisions not to apply for permits under the Clean Air Act.
In several instances, he said, E.P.A. regional officials had insisted that state agencies and Georgia-Pacific stick to E.P.A. methodology, and specifically ordered them not to substitute their own estimates. As for the industry's 1983 study, Mr. Alphonso said it was riddled with caveats, and was later discounted by the E.P.A.
According to Mr. Alphonso's view of environmental law, it was up to the E.P.A. to develop pollution standards and testing methods. He said there was a place to turn for calculating emissions and that place was the agency's own document, AP-42.
Even so, Mr. Thomas, the former E.P.A. Administrator who now works for Georgia-Pacific, said the company stood ready to settle the case and might even install controls at some plants. It has already promised to do so in Michigan.
But there is a gulf between the two sides over how many of the other plants will ultimately get new controls. Mr. Alphonso said the company's own studies indicate that many of the plants simply do not emit enough V.O.C.'s to need more controls.
In August 1994, the E.P.A. filed a notice of possible clean air violations by Georgia-Pacific, citing 26 plants. The company submitted its detailed challenge to the E.P.A.'s case in November.
The company also took its case to Capitol Hill. It drafted an amendment that would bar Federal agencies from taking action against companies whose decisions had been approved by state officials, or had relied on documents like the E.P.A.'s mistaken emissions formula. The company asked Senator David Pryor, the Arkansas Democrat, to propose the measure. He declined, but a few weeks later, a similar version turned up in Senator Dole's regulatory reform bill, as refined by Senators Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
If the Hair Is Gray, Con Artists See Green

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
BETTY NORMAN was no match for the telephone con men who emptied her pockets of more than $40,000.
A plain-talking widow who runs a small motel in Ionia, Mich., a town of state prisons and apple orchards, Mrs. Norman, born and raised here, was taught to believe that people are essentially honest. So she trusted salespeople who picked up details about her life in seemingly casual telephone chat while pitching her pens, costume jewelry and other trinkets. And after being swindled out of thousands of dollars, she lost even more to people promising to recover her original investments. 
 "It makes you feel like taking your life, to think you've been skinned," said Mrs. Norman, 68, who for months was too mortified to reveal it to her grown children. "I've been struggling along. People here have lent me money, and I'm trying to get it paid back."
Few have been hurt as badly as Mrs. Norman, but millions of older Americans know what it is to be hounded by marketers -- some legitimate, some not -- who consider the elderly easy marks. With plenty of assets, ranging from life-insurance payouts to mortgage-free homes, they are seen as lonely and more trusting than cynical baby boomers. They tend to worry about interest rates: high rates signal inflation eating away their nest eggs, while low ones mean certificates of deposit will yield less.
All this makes them prime targets for people trying to sell, sell, sell -- everything from interests in wireless cable, obscure metals and "dirt piles" said to conceal nuggets of gold to mutual fund shares and limited partnerships that promise the moon.
Not that the elderly are the only victims. It's just that they don't often see themselves as pigeons. In a recent survey sponsored by AT&T, 18 percent of Americans, up from 14 percent two years ago, admitted to being scam victims. And even though fewer respondents over 65 said they knew a victim, younger respondents said they thought the elderly were the most likely to be preyed upon. Law-enforcement officials agree; indeed, F.B.I. agents working a telephone-marketing sting in 1993 got many salespeople to admit they targeted the elderly.
What's more, it is harder for the elderly to bounce back after being swindled -- either by taking legal action, earning enough to repair their finances, or turning for help to their children who might see the mishap as proof of a loss in judgment or sign of frailty.
"It's often very, very difficult for them to admit they've been exploited because it's so humiliating," said Herbert Rosedale, a Manhattan lawyer who helps elder victims of fraud. "It's not like a kid who can say, 'So, I bought into a scam. I'll grow out of it.' "
Finding victims is simple. Older people are fairly easy to contact, either through zip codes or mailing lists of retirees. Sometimes they're taken for a ride by apparent friends, whether it's young people who turn up on doorsteps offering to carry groceries or middle-aged people who ease into church groups.
Even trusted local business people can turn into predators. The elderly "just like the Marcus Welby view of the world, that people in business are basically honest," says Philip A. Feigin, Colorado's securities commissioner and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association, which tracks investment fraud. "So many times when we crack a scam, the investors who call us are absolutely furious that we broke it up."
Of course, any investment, made at any age, can go sour. But "if you blow it when you're 30, you've got 35 years to make it up before you retire," says Barbara Roper, director of investment protection for the Consumer Federation of America. "If you blow it at 65, you may have to go back to work for the rest of your life."
The elderly are also prime targets for cults, many of which flourish in the nursing homes and sunnier climes where senior citizens are clustered. They are often expert at exploiting the loneliness that comes with living far from kin and at persuading recruits to turn over all their assets.
"Twenty-five years ago I had people calling me to say their young-adult offspring had been picked up by a cult," said Margaret Singer, a Berkeley, Calif., psychologist and leading authority on cults. "In the last five years, it's adults calling me and saying a certain cult has got their mother or their grandmother."
What follows are the main investment frauds and hazards that older Americans, and their adult children, should be aware of.
 
In the Mail, On the Phone
 Fraud that reaches the elderly by mail or telephone has been refined to a high art. Telemarketing fraud alone is believed to be a $40 billion business. Sometimes the scam starts with a puzzle or a contest, promising prizes; other times a breathless broker, complete with ticker-tape sound effects, pushes a trendy commodity or a stock too hot to resist.
"I had a lot of time to waste," said Bea Johnson, a 77-year-old retired beautician who lives alone in Roseville, Minn., and became addicted to puzzles she got in the mail. The puzzles, mostly word or number games, were supposed to qualify her for prizes like new cars or $10,000 in cash; she merely had to return them a check for $10 or $50 or more.
Mrs. Johnson lost $11,000 over two years by the time she quit in 1993. The case wound up with the Minnesota Attorney General and Mrs. Johnson became something of a celebrity, as the widow who learned to say, "No." "I still work on those puzzles they send me, but I don't send them in."
Bill Duryea, a retired Sears service representative who lives in Casa Grande, Ariz., got taken in several years ago by a salesman who called and urged him to invest in wireless cable. Mr. Duryea sent a check for $6,400. "He was blabbering and jabbering, and I don't listen to them too good," said Mr. Duryea, 80. But the same salesman had once urged him to buy shares in a cellular phone company, and Mr. Duryea regretted ignoring that pitch.
He sent off his money in 1991 -- a cashier's check, fetched by a courier (two clear warning signs of a fraud in progress). He has received nothing but a telemarketing barrage since then.
Now, he says with a chuckle, he has an answering machine that says, "If you're trying to sell me something, forget it."
Investigators say telemarketers sell one another "mooch lists" of people like Mr. Duryea, people who once took the bait, and are thus considered likely to do so again. Such lists sell for $5 to $10 a name, compared with 50 cents a name for typical mail-order lists, Mr. Barker said.
Mrs. Norman described being called repeatedly, at all hours, by a man claiming to be with an outfit called the National Recovery Service. "He would tell me to go to Western Union and send him $300, or $1,500, and he'd send me my money," she said. "One time he called and I was on the phone, and he had the operator butt in and say it was an emergency and he was my grandson. Another time he said he was driving to Michigan to bring me my money. He said he was driving a little Ford Pinto, and told me the color."
He and the Pinto never arrived, and neither did her money. She ended up spending $32,000, just for the supposed recovery, between September and December of last year. She had lost perhaps $10,000 on various contests before that, she said.
 
With Friends Like These . . .
 Often the elderly are persuaded by people they think of as friends to make inappropriate investments, or to otherwise be reckless with their money. Louise Fletcher, an 86-year-old widow, trusted the branch manager of the Scarsdale branch of the Dime Savings Bank so thoroughly that she gave him her passbooks to perform transactions. The manager, John F. Bald, was charged Friday with stealing $260,000 from Mrs. Fletcher over the last six years. Even being very rich provides no immunity. When a court-appointed investigator concluded last month that the butler to Doris Duke, the late tobacco heiress, had gone on a spending spree with money she had entrusted to him, the case was front-page news. But garden-variety scams flourish every day of the year.
In January, a Denver investment artist named Randy Romero was sentenced to four years in prison and ordered to pay $98,000 in restitution to people he had defrauded through phony securities sales. One of his techniques, said Mr. Feigin, the Colorado securities commissioner, was to win people's trust by joining church groups. His victims included a retired Lutheran pastor and several elderly parishioners.
"He used to get on his knees and pray with his fellow victims-to-be that their investment would turn out well," Mr. Feigin said. "They thought that was great."
In another case, a 77-year-old retired teacher in Maine invested almost all her savings -- $77,000 -- with a man who visited her regularly and whom she came to consider her best friend. He sold her shares of a nonexistent fund, for which he produced fake account statements that promised a 12 percent yield, said Christine Bruenn, an official with the Maine Securities Division. The man, Christopher P. Mussenden, had been well known in small Maine towns, where he had sold insurance, legitimately, for years. He was sentenced to 33 months in prison in 1993 for defrauding 25 people.
Breaking the news about him to his victims was painful, Ms. Bruenn said. "She was rocking in her rocking chair, with her cat on her lap," she said. "And I had to tell her this man she considered her best friend had done all this. She told me the cat was her only friend left."
A retired mechanic in Emigsville, Pa., had spent months discussing his financial situation with a man who repaired his roof. "We were friends for years," said the retiree, who did not want to be further identified.
But the roof man became a salesman for something variously called Tri-State Water Haven Club and Brighter Community Inc., which sold shares in a water-purification system that promised a 15 percent annual return. The retiree put in $4,000 in severance pay he had told the roofer about.
"He knew what was going on in my world," he says, "and I knew what was going on in his world. And he knew about my life savings, and there you go -- I don't have it anymore."
 
Cults
 From groups run by Lyndon LaRouche to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, cults have shifted their focus to the elderly.
"Cults recruit the elderly on the basis of their loneliness," says Margaret Singer, Berkeley, Calif., psychologist and a leading authority on cults whose book, "Cults in Our Midst" (Jossey-Bass, 1995), discusses the increasing number of elderly people joining up. "But they're going for their assets. Cults on the whole are out to get more money and more power, not to benefit the lives of the members."
Some cults play on the elderly's fears of mortality, promising eternal life, as in People Forever International Inc., based in Scottsdale, Ariz., Dr. Singer said. Others feature conspiracy theories, like the untrustworthiness of the Federal Government and the undependability of the nation's banks.
"I had a call the other day from a woman whose elderly mother had given $75,000 to organizations that were milking her for conspiracy theories," said Cynthia Kisser, executive director of the Chicago-based Cult Awareness Network. She "didn't feel the public was being told the whole truth by the media, and was being exploited because of that."
Doomsday cults urge elderly recruits to surrender money, cars and houses on the theory that since the world is about to end, they'll lose it anyway.
Ms. Kisser's organization also collected testimony from elderly people who had given money to the Lyndon LaRouche Foundation thinking this was a charitable deduction but then could not qualify for tax deductions. "One woman gave what she thought was a contribution, and they told her they would give literature to the college library of her choice," she said. Because the gift didn't come directly from her, however, the woman was ineligible for a tax deduction.
Sometimes cult recruiters perform small favors, like mowing lawns or toting grocery bags, to build up guilt in older people so they feel they have to attend a meeting. Or they might offer classes in, say, money management, that start out inexpensively but then build to ever-more-costly levels.
 
Real Deals That Mislead
 Even when the product is legitimate, many elderly people can be victimized simply by being led into making the wrong investment.
The confusion can begin at the front office, either at a bank or a brokerage house, where employees who are rewarded for their sales volumes carry titles like "financial adviser" or "financial consultant."
"This is one of my pet peeves," said Ms. Roper of the Consumer Federation. "It's particularly a problem when you have a large sum of money to invest, from a lump-sum pension or a life-insurance payout, and you go to a financial adviser at Shearson or Prudential or Merrill Lynch. They're salespeople but they're not advertised that way. "
But the securities industry begs to differ. "They're more than just salespeople," said Jeffrey M. Schaefer, director of research for the Securities Industry Association in New York. "The emphasis is on building a relationship. Those who try to concentrate on one particular transaction don't last too long."
To avoid confusion, Ms. Roper suggests contacting a fee-only financial planner, who has no financial incentive to steer clients into specific products. Consumers should then choose investments with care. Elderly people whose financial derring-do goes no farther than rolling over a certificate of deposit now and then should be especially wary when other financial products such as mutual funds are being pushed at their local bank branch.
"Sometimes the same vice president who's selling them to a retired couple is the person who gave them that college loan or the money for an extension on their house," said Mr. Feigin. "What's worse is that many of the salespeople are new to the industry, don't have good training and may think what they're selling is good for the client."
With mutual funds, titles can be misleading and the funds themselves inappropriate for older people, who, like everyone else, can neglect to read the prospectus's fine print. Ms. Roper points to the Piper Jaffray Institutional Government Fund Portfolio -- it sounded as sturdy and all-American as apple pie, but it actually contained high-risk mortgage-backed derivatives. The fund lost 28 percent of its value last year alone.
In Maine, regulators joined counterparts from several other states to bring a lawsuit against First Investors Corporation, which had marketed high-yield funds to local residents, many of them elderly.
When interest rates fell in the early 1990's, "a lot of elderly people became vulnerable to investment pitches that promised them a continuing high level of interest without additional risk," said Stephen Diamond, the state securities administrator. But certain funds, like First Investors' Income Fund and High Yield Fund, contained junk bonds. "They were overtly or at least subtly misleading these people about the risk," he said. The case culminated in a $9 million judgment in December against Merchants Trust, the bank that had marketed the fund.
"We tend to blame the victims, but no one can say they're immune to this," said Mr. Feigin. "It could be your mother next time."
 
 
 
What to Look For And Whom to Contact
 EXPERTS offer the following tips for dealing with telephone salespeople.
1. Just hang up. Or better yet, get an answering machine, which prevents that verbal foot-in-the-door.
"Never do investment business over the phone," says Philip A. Feigin, president of the North American Securities Administrators Association.
2. Beware any salesman who says he or she will send a courier to pick up your check.This began as a means of skirting Federal mail-fraud laws, Mr. Feigin said.
3. Any salesman who calls should be willing to meet in person, to give addresses of local sales offices and to send a prospectus.
Even so, it's helpful to check out his or her credentials, as well as the firm's -- through the state Attorney General's office, the state securities administrator or other watchdog agencies.
4. Investigate every angle of a mutual fund. Read the prospectus; find out what's being included in the fund.
Ask what relationship exists between the bank selling the fund and the fund's management. Ask about fees and front-end loads.
Remember that not everything is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
5. Be cynical. If something seems too good to be true, it usually is.
6. For children of the elderly, continuous contact can help avoid problems. Loneliness is frequently a factor when older people take affection, services or other bait from someone who is after their money.
People who suspect they may have been victims of an investment fraud can contact their state Attorney General's office or local securities administrators.
In addition, the following agencies and organizations may be helpful in reporting or averting fraud.
The National Fraud Information Center operates a special telephone line weekdays from 9 A.M. to 5:30 P.M.: (800) 876-7060.
For referrals to fee-only financial planners, contact the National Association of Personal Financial Advisers, (800) 366-2732.
To investigate the credentials of a stockbroker or securities firm, call the North American Association of Securities Administrators, at (202) 737-0900.
For guidance on investing in mutual funds, the S.E.C. publishes a brochure,"Invest Wisely," which is available by calling (202) 942-7040.
For information on cults, sources include the Cult Awareness Network, (312) 267-7777; the International Cult Education Project, (212) 439-1550, and the Maynard Bernstein Center for Cult Education, (213) 852-1234.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Small Funds Bulk Up With Borrowed Money as Stocks Soar

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
IS your mutual fund on steroids?
A handful of funds are. They have turned to the financial equivalent of steroids -- leverage -- in search of heftier returns. What they do is leverage their assets, by borrowing money from a bank, to invest more than their shareholders have contributed. 
 But heavy borrowing by a fund should give pause to any investor who is not prepared for a high degree of volatility. Financial leverage sharpens performance on the way up but magnifies losses on the way down. A swooning stock market, therefore, could leave a leveraged fund reeling.
In such a great year for stocks, there would seem to be few reasons for fund managers to use any artificial performance enhancers. According to Lipper Analytical Services, nearly two-thirds of all equity funds have gained more than 10 percent so far this year. But only 148 of 1,701 equity funds, or 8.7 percent, have outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 index.
By borrowing money to invest, funds improve their chances of beating the average in a rising market.
Trying to maximize gains is a common pursuit these days. The most recent data from the Investment Company Institute, the Washington trade group for mutual funds, show that cash levels in domestic stock funds fell to 7 percent of total assets at the end of March -- the lowest level since 1978. Normally, fund managers maintain higher cash levels to cover any shareholder redemptions and to provide a cushion should share prices decline. But holding cash this year has meant below-par returns.
One indicator of whether a fund has taken the next step and begun borrowing is when its cash position turns negative, something tracked since 1986 by Morningstar Inc., the fund researchers in Chicago. A search of the Morningstar data base found that 2.4 percent of the 2,000 equity funds it tracks had a negative cash position at the end of the first quarter. Though high, that is well below the record of 4.3 percent with negative cash positions in the tumultuous fourth quarter of 1987.
Screened out then were international funds, which might borrow to hedge against currency losses, and hybrid funds, which often contain more bonds than stocks. Of the pure domestic equity portfolios remaining on the list, most had negative cash positions of less than 2 percent of assets. Four funds had very heavy borrowing, led by Yorktown Classic Value at nearly 50 percent, making them particularly vulnerable should stock prices retreat.
Mutual funds can borrow money only if the possibility is spelled out in the prospectus, and then the cash must be borrowed from a bank. Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the money cannot be borrowed from a brokerage firm, and funds cannot buy stocks on margin.
But as with so many contingencies detailed in those impenetrable documents, most funds rarely avail themselves of the right to borrow. When they do, it is often for short periods -- a few days perhaps, to pay a large shareholder who wants a redemption.
A handful of aggressive funds turn to leverage more regularly, sometimes borrowing for months at a time. The results can be spectacular. the Yorktown Classic Value fund, which had far and away the most leverage in the Morningstar data search, is one of the best performers this year in its class of growth stocks. The $5.7 million fund has gained nearly 23 percent since Jan. 1.
But in its first two years, the fund seriously trailed the Standard & Poor's 500, by 6.5 percentage points in 1993 and 5.3 percentage points last year.
"We've used leverage since Day 1," said David D. Basten, manager of the Yorktown fund. "And we probably always will as long as interest rates and inflation are stable. It's a tremendous advantage to be able to borrow cheaply, at about 9 percent, and earn more than double that amount in returns."
A mutual fund is allowed to borrow the equivalent of 50 percent of its net assets. Put another way, one-third of a fund's total assets can be borrowed money. Yorktown Classic Value nearly always borrows up to the limit: At the end of the first quarter, borrowing totaled 47.3 percent of net assets.
Yorktown's concentrated portfolio of only about 20 stocks at a time may add to the fund's volatility, Mr. Basten said. But he insists that because the fund focuses on high-quality stocks -- its biggest holdings are May Department Stores, at 12 percent of assets, and Owens Corning-Fiberglas at 9 percent -- leverage does not guarantee disaster when the market turns negative.
"If the market takes a severe hit, sure our stocks will get hit," Mr. Basten said. "But if you're already in strong, high-quality issues, half the portfolio might get hammered, but the other half will only get semi-hammered. And we increase our position in the less battered ones."
Simple math, however, shows how leverage can hurt. Suppose funds A and B each have $10 million in assets. Both funds invest all their money, but Fund B borrows an additional $5 million, at an annual interest rate of 10 percent, and invests it.
If the stocks in each fund rise 20 percent, Fund B, after repaying the $5 million it borrowed and interest of $500,000, ends the year with a gain of $2.5 million, or 25 percent. Fund A, of course, finishes with a 20 percent gain.
BUT suppose the funds' investments fall 20 percent. Then Fund B, after repaying its borrowing and interest costs, is left with $6.5 million, a loss of 35 percent, compared with Fund A's 20 percent loss.
A negative cash position, though, may reflect factors other than borrowing to buy stock. A March 31 snapshot of Bull & Bear Special Equities showed a negative cash position of nearly 19 percent.
Brett Sneed, the manager of the fund, said he had borrowed some money to invest and then on the last day of the quarter shareholders requested redemptions representing nearly 10 percent of the fund's assets. Rather than sell that much of the portfolio immediately, Mr. Sneed borrowed most of the amount to repay the investors. Since then, he has reduced much of the debt.
"Right now, our borrowings are at about 6.4 percent," Mr. Sneed said, calling that a typical amount. "If we have money in the fund that might be deemed warm or hot, that might move quickly out, we are more likely to stay away from leveraging. We don't want to be caught with a down market and have money running out."
Some funds use leverage sporadically. Mark D. Beckerman, manager of the 44 Wall Street Equity fund, pointed to good years from 1991 to 1993, when the fund gained 18 percent to 26 percent each year, without borrowing.
At the end of last year, however, with bullish sentiment rising, the manager decided to increase borrowing, to near its current level of 11.6 percent. In recent weeks, the fund's return has spiked upward as well. "If we had a more extensive use of leverage, we might be scaling back," Mr. Beckerman said. "But we still have stocks that haven't appreciated that much, so we probably will stay about where we are now.
"Leverage is simply a tool," he added, "and when it's used properly it's going to work for you."
Shelton Swei, co-manager of two Alger funds that use leverage, notes that if declining stock prices push a fund above the permissible amount of leverage, it has three days to sell stocks to return to the limit. Although his funds can buy more volatile instruments than stocks using leverage, they have done so "only very modestly," he said.
When the bond market turned south last year, investors in some leveraged bond funds learned about the danger of borrowed money. Investors in stock funds that are using leverage face the same painful lesson if stocks reverse course.

Playing the Game of Tariff Tag

BYLINE: By HUBERT B. HERRING 

 BODY:
SUPPOSE that instead of a used car, you're in the market for a Lexus or an Infiniti. What do you do now that the Clinton Administration has slapped 100 percent tariffs on these and other Japanese luxury cars?
The tariff went into effect for cars not on these shores yesterday, though it won't be applied until June 28. So while politicians tryto work things out, prospective car buyers are left to agonize over the next step. 
 After all, with that killer tariff, a $30,000 Acura Legend would top $50,000, while a top-of-the-line $50,000 Lexus would be . . . no, you don't want to know. The Japanese car makers are saying they will hold dealer prices steady for now, covering the tariffs themselves if the sanctions hold. So their loyal fans are rushing to lock in today's prices.
Dealers, of course, could take advantage of the situation by padding prices, but visions of a stampede down the street to the Mercedes or BMW dealer might give them pause. "Jaguar and BMW must be licking their chops," said one trade lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 Susan Jacobs, a consultant in Rutherford, N.J., to the auto industry, said buyers with their "hearts set on a Lexus should probably go ahead and close the deal." For if June drags on with no resolution, she said, prices will start to rise. But she added, "If you're undecided between a Lexus and a European vehicle, it's better to wait."
Many impatient souls were spotted at dealers last week. "I'm sure a lot of people will rush out to buy" Japanese luxury cars, said Ted Orme, spokesman for the National Automobile Dealers Association. He estimated that dealers had a 60- to 80-day supply of cars. But he said that if you rush to buy at what is unlikely to be the best price, "you may be jumping the gun, gambling that the tariffs will go through."
 That's the big question: Will the tariffs stick? The trade lawyer predicted that the World Trade Organization would rule the sanctions illegal, but that could take months. And John Jackson, a University of Michigan law professor and a top trade scholar, has said that the Japanese have a "flat-out easy case."
But Ms. Jacobs, calling herself a pessimist, said she "wouldn't be surprised if we end up with some sort of sanctions." If full sanctions hold, she said, the affected dealers "would be transformed" though most would still be around. Since auto parts are not affected, the dealers could still provide service.
But will parts be readily available years down the road? And will your dealer -- the one you had counted on for service -- survive? Either loss could make life bumpy.
 What all this adds up to is if you're dead set on buying a Japanese luxury car, do it now -- but don't expect a plum deal. (And don't forget that the luxury tax kicks in at $32,000.) If you're wavering, keep wavering.

Vendors Fear Another Block Could Be Another Country

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Pulsing to the rhythms of dance hall reggae, the intersection of Fulton Street and Nostrand Avenue is a kind of Caribbean and African bazaar where street vendors hawk herbs such as sea moss and bacano, handmade leather hats, purses carved from calabash gourds and landscapes that are painted while you wait.
But the burgeoning outdoor market is scheduled to close on June 1, when the city says it will move the vendors off Fulton Street. The vendors are worried about the plan, which calls for them to leave the commercial hub of Bedford-Stuyvesant for a vacant lot on Tompkins Avenue, three blocks away. 
 "If customers have to leave where they're walking and look for us in some parking lot, they're not going to come find us," said Raphael Charles, a 40-year-old from Grenada who sells West Indian herbs. "This is a good form of self-employment."
The impetus for the city's actions comes, in part, from neighborhood merchants with whom the vendors had peacefully coexisted for years. But the sluggish economy has prompted complaints from store owners worried about sidewalk congestion and competition from merchants who don't pay rent.
"At first, nine out of 10 merchants said that they would let vendors sell in front of their stores as long as they did not sell the same things," said Joe Long, the chairman of the Fulton-Nostrand United Merchants Association. "It only changed when the economy changed."
Their efforts to remove the vendors were bolstered after Mayor Giuliani ordered vendors removed from 125th Street in Harlem and other major thoroughfares in the city. Mr. Long, who owns Birdy's Tapes and Audio Store on Fulton Street, contacted City Councilwoman Annette M. Robinson, who represents the area, to plan the move. "We are hopeful that there will not be a lot of resistance because we've been planning this for years," Ms. Robinson said.
Lewis A. Watkins, the district manager of Community Board 3, agreed that the streets are often overcrowded, but he said he would like some vendors to remain on Fulton Street. "The city established a policy that they want to clear all the vendors," he said. "It's not about a community demand. I think the community should have some say-so."
Many street vendors said they felt betrayed by the impending city action. "America is a country of freedom and rights, a country that encourages business and enterprise," said Simeon Chickosie, a 40-year-old from Arima, Trinidad, who sewed a leather hat as he spoke. "I don't see why they should stop us."
"It's sad," said Mucai Albert, a 45-year-old from Senegal who was forced to stop selling his $5 sunglasses on the Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan last year. "This is not Manhattan, this is not downtown -- it's Brooklyn. I don't know what will happen if we move. But God is good."
Mr. Long and Ms. Robinson said they would leaflet the neighborhood and send out sound trucks to try to drum up business for the new market on Tompkins Avenue.
But Otis Andrews, a 27-year-old from Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, who was working on a leather bracelet with an awl, said that Tompkins Avenue may be too out-of-the-way.
"The vendors bring sales to the stores," he said. "People come to see us and then they go to the stores."
John Baldeo, the owner of Tony's Country Life Food Shop, a store on Fulton Street, agreed. "A lot of people come here for the outdoor market," he said. "People like crowds. New York is about crowds. If this becomes a lonely street people will be scared to walk here."
Outside Tony's, Franklin Holland and his friend, who gave his name only as Mark, set out cosmetics, tube socks, tapes and Mike Tyson T-shirts. Mr. Baldeo said that he would like to let them continue selling there.
"They keep the sidewalk clean, they help me close at night," he said. "In the winter they even shovel the snow." MICHAEL COOPER

A Gathering of Clans Puts Power in Relief

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
In an unusual alignment of opposing political constellations, the Republicans and the Democrats are both on the road in New Jersey this weekend, the Republicans to celebrate a sense of power and purpose, the Democrats literally wondering what to do next.
The Republicans are spending the weekend in Atlantic City for the Republican Leadership Conference, a gathering of Northeastern state party chairmen operating on an agenda whose absence of strenuousness says a lot about the G.O.P.'s confident mood. Several of the leading Presidential contenders were scheduled to speak, Governor Whitman should see her national reputation burnished, a few strategy sessions will spell out campaign themes, but gripping and grinning is about as much work as there is to do. 
 New Jersey state Democrats met on a smaller scale Friday and Saturday in Long Branch, a town that might have politely changed its name to Square One in honor of the Democrats' situation. "A Party of Ideas" was the theme, and its purpose was to decide what the Democrats stand for in the age of Whitman.
One thing is clear, according to a statement of party principles that Tom Byrne, the state chairman, put out Tuesday: New Jersey Democrats are in the "the post-Florio era," which was the era of the old Democratic ideas about state intervention when the opportunity arose, and higher taxes if necessary.
"As a party, we are committed to a government that is lean without being mean," Mr. Byrne said, paraphrasing Mrs. Whitman's catch phrase for Republican management, "leaner and smarter." "Democrats," Mr. Byrne continued, "are proud of their long tradition of commonsense solutions to the problems of everyday working men and women."
That tradition has written some brave chapters in New Jersey. The income tax, enacted when Mr. Byrne's father, Brendan T. Byrne, was Governor, broke the cycle of ever-rising property taxes and put school financing on a rational and fair basis. Democrats began the long and still unfinished task of winning an equal break for inner-city schools. New Jersey's environmental laws are some of the most thorough in the country, although the Republicans have certainly participated in their enactment. Mr. Florio, now largely ignored by his own state party, outfaced the Republicans on his assault- rifle ban, which was a worthy task just on principle in a society besotted with firepower, even though the firearms that he outlawed were rarely used in crimes.
But politics is heartless, and its operating motto is "What have you done for me lately?" With many of the fundamentals in place, the Democrats took too long in figuring out that "everyday working men and women" had found new things to worry about.
Take a very minor example, the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit. Begun in the name of fuel economy, retained in the name of safety, it is as frustrating as it is ignored by everyday men and women. Yet from Boston to Albany to Trenton, Democratic administrations dismissed talk of changing it. Now, for reasons that have nothing to do with speed limits but lots to do with frustration, Republicans are running those states and before long, the speed limits on the appropriate, Federally certifed stretches of highway, will be back at 65, as they already are in Massachussetts.
When the new signs go up in New Jersey, a lot of everyday people are going to say a silent, "Thanks, Christie." By then the Democrats will have endorsed the idea, but "me too" is a losers's strategy.
"The comparison I see is to the Republicans in the 1950's," said Stephen Salmore, a grizzled Republican strategist whose wisdom is rooted in his skepticism, including where Mrs. Whitman is concerned. "In the 50's the Republicans said the Democrats' ideas weren't bad but that Republicans could do them better because they were businessmen. Now the Democrats are saying, 'The Republicans' ideas are good but they can't do it compassionately.' "
The 1993 campaign said something about the appeal of compassion in a state like New Jersey, where a lot of people were too worried about jobs and their value of their homes to fret for others. At several points in the campaign, Mrs. Whitman even used the compassion argument against Mr. Florio, accusing him of cruelty to welfare mothers for the limits on benefits contained in his welfare reform.
It did not catch on with the voters, and in a grab for an issue that is universally described as desperate, she uttered the only words that are beyond the reach of even me-too Democrats: tax cut.
So this weekend, the Republicans are relaxing in Atlantic City, and the Democrats are back at a place called Square One.

Pay: Low. Future: None. Still Want a Summer Job? Get in Line.

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
As Memorial Day approaches and the school year slouches to a close, a frenetic ritual is well under way. The teen-agers of New Jersey are scrambling for summer work, and despite slight improvements in the state's economy, those jobs are still relatively scarce.
After several years of recession, when young people were competing with adults for summer jobs, the market finally improved last year. In the third quarter of 1994, unemployment among New Jersey residents age 16 to 19 was 16 percent, down from 20.7 percent in 1993. But the chances of finding a job were much slimmer than in the late 1980's, when a labor shortage made it a summer job-seeker's market, and the State Department of Labor's annual employer outlook survey, to be published in June, suggests that the market will remain stagnant this summer as well. 
 "What we hear is that employers expect hiring to be about the same as last year," said Jan DeJong, chief of the labor department's Bureau of Labor Market Information. "We have definitely improved over the recession levels, but it doesn't look like there will be considerable change this summer."
An exception could be the shore region, where 54 percent of all tourist dollars are spent and businesses experienced an economic rebound last summer. In fact, the shore offers more seasonal jobs than any other part of the state, so thousands of adolescents flock there each June, seemingly eager to hawk T-shirts, dispense snow cones and deliver seafood platters to tables of tourists.
But even when the economy is thriving at the shore, the number of summer jobs does not necessarily grow. The Casino Pier and Waterworks in Seaside Heights hires about 700 employees every summer, regardless of the economic mood.
"It may vary by 10 or 20 people, but the number of jobs doesn't change," said Bill Erwin, the general manager, adding that he would be hiring slightly fewer people this season. Like many shore businesses, the amusement pier has far more applicants than jobs. Typically, Mr. Erwin said, 700 teen-agers apply for 180 positions at the pier's water park.
For job-seekers who lack seaside lodging, there is a popular alternative: the Six Flags Great Adventure amusement park.
The park, located in Jackson, is the state's largest private summer employer. Last summer, about 5,000 high school and college students worked as ride attendants, maintenance workers and security guards, among other things. So far this year, almost 8,000 people have applied for summer jobs at the park, and 3,558 -- mostly teen-agers -- have been hired.
Like boardwalk businesses, Great Adventure lures the same employees back year after year. MaryBeth Clayton, the public relations manager, said 60 percent of the park's employees from last summer were returning for another season. Some, like Zhi Zhi Kurokawa, confess to wanting a year-round job there.
"It's a great place because the company shows us how much they appreciate us," said Miss Kurokawa, who at 22 has spent seven summers at Great Adventure. Barbecues and bingo games for employees, she said, make up for the long shifts spent under a hot sun. And the friendships that blossom among park employees continue after Labor Day.
Another perk is transportation: Because many teen-agers lack cars, Great Adventure transports employees between the park and 18 locations in Burlington, Mercer, Monmouth and Ocean counties.
While most summer jobs are found by combing the classified section or scouting out "Help Wanted" signs, Great Adventure actively seeks employees with a corporate approach. In January, the park holds a "rehire reunion," giving the previous summer's employees the first crack at positions for the coming summer. (The most popular job? Ride attendant, by a long shot.)
It then recruits at 53 colleges and 46 high schools throughout New Jersey, including inner-city schools in Trenton. Applicants, who must be at least 16, go through three interviews. Those who are hired must endure rigorous training in the art of being "guest friendly." (In other words, if someone asks directions to the Viper roller coaster, a park worker must cheerfully explain a route.)
Despite the park's efforts to hire in advance, it is flooded with calls from skittish parents well into June. Latecomers need not abandon hope: Many young people cannot work the entire summer, so jobs open up constantly.
"It's a Catch-22 working with kids because their schedules are so unpredictable," Ms. Clayton said. "So if someone leaves in August, we'll hire someone else to work through Labor Day."
Like most summer jobs, the pay at Great Adventure is not a major incentive. Beginners earn a minimum wage of $5.05 an hour, while people with seniority earn up to $7. The money apparently doesn't matter to Miss Kurokawa, who said she turned down a lucrative marketing job at Trump's Castle in Atlantic City to return to the park.
"I actually started working there, but I missed this place so much that I couldn't stay," she said. "Knowing I could be here, I couldn't stand being somewhere else."
 
JOB SEARCH: Help Wanted
 Here are some suggestions from several guidance counselors.
SIX FLAGS GREAT ADVENTURE Hires workers throughout the summer. Call(908) 928-2000, ext. 2636.
RACE TRACKS There are several, including Freehold Raceway in Freehold, Garden State Park in Cherry Hill and Monmouth Park Race Track in Oceanport. Some need summer help. Check the yellow pages.
STATE PARKS Many need extra maintenance workers. Check the blue pages of the phone book.
RECREATION DEPARTMENTS Municipalities hire workers for maintenance work and recreation programs. Call your town's recreation department, listed in the blue pages.
TEMPORARY SECRETARIAL WORK Jobs can last from a day to a few months. Typing and some computer skills are usually required. Call placement services, listed in the yellow pages under Employment Agencies.

Japan's Secret Weapon Is the Piggy Bank

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
AS America hurtles toward a trade war with Japan, most economists think the United States' trade deficit has little to do with protectionism in Japan. The real problem, they say, is that Joe Sixpack uses his paycheck to buy CD's from Wal-Mart while Joko Sixpackayama uses hers to buy CD's from a bank.
 How's that? 
 The underlying reason for the American trade deficit, the economists say, is that Americans have a miserable record of saving for the future. And one of the most fundamental principles of economics -- and among the least understood -- is that trade balances reflect how countries save and invest their money.
 So even if Washington forces Japan to buy more American cars and parts, don't expect a decline in the trade deficit. Since it is savings and investment that mainly determine trade deficits, the overall deficit would stay about the same.
 "The reason you will find very few economists who will disagree with that is simply that it comes straight out of the basic national income accounting that we teach students in the very first week of the very first economics course," said Peter B. Kenen, a Princeton economics professor.
 This may be essential to understanding trade disputes, but hardly anyone understands it. Nor is there recognition of the prospect that Japan's aging population and dropping savings rate may solve the problem, giving Japan its own trade deficit.
 The bottom line is this: If a country saves more than it invests in new factories and equipment, it will definitely run a trade surplus. Or, in America's case, vice-versa.
 "If the U.S. addressed the domestic problems that it has, such as the budget deficit and the household savings rate, all this U.S.-Japan protectionism argument would appear as nothing more than a hill of beans," said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist of Salomon Brothers in Tokyo.

 
 
Take That
 The United States primed its artillery in the trade war a few days ago by imposing 100 percent tariffs that will make the Lexus, Infiniti and other luxury cars unsalable in the United States. The tariffs will be revoked if the two countries reach agreement in the next six weeks.
 In the meantime both countries are taking the case to the newly created World Trade Organization. Many experts believe the United States is likely to lose the suit brought by Japan.
 Most economists think the Japanese Government is less responsible for America's trade deficit than the American Government -- which borrows to cover the budget deficit -- and the American people, who save only around 5 percent of their disposable incomes. In contrast, Japan is a champion saver, the world's richest creditor nation, whose people save about 14 percent of their disposable incomes.
 So what's the connection with the trade deficit?
 It works like this: Last year Americans bought $155 billion more in Toyota cars, German beer and whatnot than foreigners bought in American products. That means a $155 billion deficit in the current account, which is the broadest measure of trade.
 So how do Americans make up the bill? They borrow: Other countries lend $155 billion of their extra savings. This is called the capital account, and it measures the extra savings that flow across borders. It exactly equals the current account.
 Japan exports its excess savings -- exporting $125 billion of capital last year. And that means that it had to run a current account surplus of $125 billion as well.

 
 
From Lexus to Mercedes

 The United States had a shortfall of savings, requiring an infusion of $155 billion last year. And that means that it had to run a current account deficit of $155 billion.
 So unless the relationship between savings and investment changes, in either Japan or the United States, it doesn't help to force Japanese to use American spark plugs. This might help the spark plug workers, but if the overall American trade deficit is unchanged, it just means that some other American exports have been crowded out: a spark plug factory in Michigan is saved, but a logging camp in Oregon goes bankrupt.
 "Let's suppose we succeed in really clobbering the Japanese auto industry," suggested William R. Cline, a trade expert at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. The high tariffs would mean that the United States would buy several billion dollars less in luxury Japanese cars, although the money might be used to buy German Mercedes-Benzes instead.
 The Japanese car makers would then face an economic crisis, and Mazda in particularly might not survive. The Japanese economy would slow down a bit, and Japanese auto executives would stop ordering log homes from Oregon, or even Jeep Cherokees from Chrysler. Over all, American employment would be unchanged.
 If economists think trade pressure on Japan isn't going to make much difference, what is the Clinton Administration up to?
 Partly, the answer is politics. Extra support among union members will outweigh any lost votes among economics professors.
 There are also more charitable explanations. For starters, there are economists who disagree to some extent with this conventional view. There are also some Japan specialists who complain that economic theory is virtually useless in explaining what goes on in Japan.
 Perhaps more important, the Clinton Administration points out that there is the issue of fairness. For half a century, Japanese industry and Government have colluded to place all kinds of obstacles in the way of American and other exporters, and threats have been the only way to reduce these barriers. Almost all economists would agree that the world has an interest in trying to get Japan to play by the same rules as other countries.
 The problem with the fairness issue is that in this dispute the United States has acted in such a way that it is about the only country that thinks it has right on its side.
 Almost everybody shares the American annoyance with Japanese officials, and the conviction that foreign exporters and Japanese consumers alike would benefit from a liberalization of rules. But in this case, there is a widespread feeling that the United States had adopted the wrong tactics, and that it is unjustified in bypassing the international trade system -- the World Trade Organization -- that has just been set up.
 The European Community a few days ago rebuked the United States for undermining the World Trade Organization, and the Economist magazine accused Washington of "truly breathtaking hypocrisy." The Financial Times warned in an editorial that "rarely -- perhaps never -- has U.S. action posed such a clear and direct threat to the fundamental principles of the multilateral trading system."
 Is a trade deficit bad? The answer, as with anything in economics, is: It depends. (President Truman, frustrated with economists always saying "on the other hand," once asked for a one-armed economist.)
 In the 19th century, the United States ran trade deficits, and this was the wise thing to do. The trade deficit meant that the United States was borrowing from foreign countries, and the money was used to build railroads and steel plants. These were sensible reasons to borrow.
 But mature economies, like the United States today, normally are lenders, not borrowers. There is no huge American construction program that requires foreign loans. And the trade deficit means that American children will have to pay back the loans their parents are taking out today.
 If the United States is serious about cutting its trade deficit, economists say, it should look for ways to boost its savings rate. Eliminating the tax-deductibility of mortgage payments would discourage people from borrowing to buy homes. Making interest income tax-free would encourage savings, and so would a high national sales tax in place of part of the income tax.
 Japan uses some of these methods. It has a national value-added tax, and its cut-rate taxes on interest income encourage savings. But these approaches primarily help the richest people, and in America they would be politically difficult or impossible to put in place.

 
 
The Graying of Japan

 In any case, the underlying role of savings and investment could mean that Japan's trade surplus will disappear on its own over the next two decades. This is because the Japanese population is aging rapidly, as its baby boomers become denture boomers. By the year 2020, a quarter of Japanese may be over 65.
 People normally save during their careers, and withdraw money from savings when they retire. So when Japan has more old people, it may have fewer people depositing into savings accounts, and more retirees withdrawing from their accounts.
 "Our savings rates will fall as our population ages," said Yukio Noguchi, an economics professor at Hitotsubashi University near Tokyo. Professor Noguchi's research suggests that savings will fall even lower than investment by about 2005 or 2010. That would mean that Japan would then be running a trade deficit.
 And then Japan, horrified by its trade deficits, may begin screaming about American protectionism.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Balancing Ax;
Doing Well in a Deficit-Free America. Or Not So Well.

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
FOR the first time since the golden 60's, the goal of a balanced budget suddenly seems within reach. The idea is hugely popular. The new Republican majority apparently has the clout to make it happen. And now the House and Senate Republicans have produced their versions of a balanced budget, complete with timetables and dollar targets.
 Many of the particulars will change as Congress hammers out a compromise. And no one can know whether the moment's political resolve will buckle -- it's happened before -- or whether the plan will indeed whittle the deficit from $200 billion to zero in a mere seven years. But whatever comes of the negotiations is bound to follow the current formula of stiff restraints on health care spending, a freeze on defense and deep cuts in Government programs. 
If the balancing act actually works, there will be lots of obvious losers, from forest rangers to Medicare recipients. Less easy to spot in the $1 trillion-plus of spending cuts are the winners.
 Some groups would escape the ax almost completely. Others would reap rewards from tax cuts. Still others -- a majority, most economists say -- would gain more from the benefits of deficit reduction to the economy than they would lose in Government services and checks. Economists figure that interest rates could fall by a percentage point or two as the Government borrows less and total demand for credit shrinks, and that the dollar will become even cheaper, spurring exports. Job and income growth are apt to be slightly faster than they would be if deficits kept piling up.
 Here are some of the probable winners and losers in this scenario.

 
 
The Elderly
 America's retirees have long been one of the biggest beneficiaries of Government largess. Now they will feel a squeeze. Almost half the savings -- over $400 billion -- is supposed to come from limiting growth in Medicare and Medicaid, which together make up the biggest item in the Federal budget after Social Security. Total spending would keep rising, but at a rate much lower than the double-digit pace of recent years. Further, though Social Security is off the table, the cost-of-living increase would shrink if a more accurate inflation measure replaces the Consumer Price Index. "The elderly, obviously, are the big losers," said Alan Auerbach of the University of California at Berkeley, former chief economist of the Congressional Joint Tax Committee. Still, he said, these blows are likely to be softened if interest rates fall: that would push up the price of most assets, from homes to stocks, and older Americans own most of these.

 
 
The Young
 If today's elderly pay for a bigger share of what they receive, tomorrow's workers can only benefit. Economists say current policies mean astronomical tax rates -- or huge benefit cuts -- for future generations. Lawrence Kotlikoff, an economist at Boston University, said that under the Senate proposal, the tax rate on future generations would drop to 72 percent of their lifetime wages. While that's a big improvement from the 84 percent that he projects under current policies, it is still "twice as high as current generations and still infeasible," he said. Of course, the plan also envisions cuts in some benefits for young Americans, including college loans and job training.

 
 
Washington, D.C.
 For Government employees and contractors, particularly those clustered in and around Washington, the Republican budget qualifies as a neutron bomb -- the kind that leaves buildings standing but eliminates people inside. The House version calls for abolishing the Commerce, Education and Energy Departments and the Interstate Commerce Commission. The Senate plan includes a seven-year pay freeze for senior Government officials. Mark Zandi, an economist at Regional Financial Associates in Philadelphia, calculates that the cuts would cost the nation's capital almost 12,000 jobs, or 2 percent of its job base, by the year 2003. New York and New Jersey, by contrast, stand to gain 60,000 jobs over the same period, spurred by tax changes.

 
 
Military Types
 Talk about dodging bullets. At the end of nearly every war in American history, Congress has slashed military spending to the bone. Not so after the cold war. True, the Republican budget blueprints call for freezing the defense budget at last year's level. Assuming an inflation rate of 3 percent, that would amount to a cut of more than 20 percent in real terms, and points to continued consolidation among weapons manufacturers. Nonetheless, says Stephen Moore, an economist at the Cato Institute, that is extremely gradual by historical standards. "Republicans are still fighting the cold war that doesn't exist anymore," he said. "They could do 40 percent."

 
 
Home Builders
 An interest-rate decline of a point or two would almost certainly fuel a housing boom, boost construction employment and spur lumber and appliance sales. Other interest-sensitive industries, from cars to computers, would get a lift, too. When rates declined in the early 1990's, new single-home construction and car sales helped pull the economy out of a recession.

 
 
Unions
 The Republican budget plans include several land mines for organized labor. One is the elimination of the Davis-Bacon Act, a law that requires union-scale wages for workers on government construction projects; striking it from the books would almost surely depress pay scales. And urban transit subsidies, for the most part, bolster the pay of transit workers. And there would be direct hits to government employment, just about the only area where unionization is growing.

 
 
Farmers
 An increasingly important Republican constituency, farmers may do rather well in the budget balancing process. The budget plans call for cuts in rural programs, like soil conservation and waste and water treatment, but major crop subsidies look likely to survive. Further, farmers are large net borrowers and own lots of assets. So they would be among the biggest beneficiaries of an interest-rate decline.

 
 
Doctors
 The pain of Medicare and Medicaid cuts for the poor and elderly would almost certainly be shared by their doctors and hospitals. Some of the squeeze would probably be felt by the privately insured, who may, in effect, subsidize patients with Government insurance.

 
 
Exporters
 Lower rates tend to keep the dollar cheap, too, as investors pass up American assets to buy up those of countries offering higher returns. So a deficit that's heading toward zero should, other things being equal, keep the dollar on the weak side. That's good for exporters, like makers of jet aircraft and fabricators of specialty steels.

 
 
The Poor
 Even enthusiasts of welfare changes agree that poor people who depend on the Government for cash, food, housing and medical care are likely to suffer. Both the House and Senate budget plans envision steep cuts. Part of the impact on the poor could be offset by new job opportunities. "The number of jobs overall will increase," said Roger Brinner, chief economist at Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass. "With all these interest-sensitive sectors expanding, there will be more unskilled jobs in manufacturing and construction, as well as highly skilled ones."

 
 
The Middle Class
 It's the middle class that stands to gain most if deficit reduction swells national saving, encourages investment and leads to greater productivity gains and faster wage growth. But the middle class stands to gain in the short term, too.
 With lower interest rates, homeowners can refinance mortgages and stand to see their homes appreciate in value. Those who hold bonds or stocks benefit from asset appreciation as yields decline. Lower taxes on capital gains and estates would also raise the return to investing.
 Some benefits would be offset by cuts in Government services like student loans and possibly tougher tax treatment of fringe benefits. But in general, "since Social Security won't be cut, the middle class has been spared," said Joel Prakken, an economist at Laurence Meyer in St. Louis. "The tax cuts go to a lot of people, including the rich."

 
 
The Economists
 These tireless advocates of the benefits of zero deficits are about to get a kick in the teeth. At least under the Senate plan, the entire social sciences portion of the National Science Foundation, the independent Government agency that finances most of the research by most of the field's superstars, is about to be wiped out.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends;
Riding on Straw And Other Polls

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
HERE'S a news flash from the Presidential campaign headquarters of Lamar Alexander: A survey of likely Republican primary voters across the country concluded that Mr. Alexander "leads overall and in every region of the country." Bar graphs show vividly that he even beats Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, 34 percent to 25 percent, and that he is wildly popular with female voters. 
 But there's a hitch. These expected voters were not actually expressing support for Mr. Alexander, but for a mythical contender named "Candidate B."

 
 
Faux Poll to the Rescue
 Since Mr. Alexander, a former Tennessee Governor and Education Secretary, barely registers on most voter surveys, his campaign needed to do something to convince reporters, fund raisers and others that he is gaining steam. And since no actual votes are cast until next February, contenders must somehow establish credibility to boost their organizational and financial efforts.
 Thus, the faux poll. "You only publicize it when it's good for you," said Michael Murphy, one of Mr. Alexander's top advisers. "But if I were the Dole campaign, the numbers would scare the hell out of me."
 While candidates have long toyed with ways to inflate their political stature, those running for the 1996 nomination have begun the process particularly early and, increasingly, are spending money on sophisticated strategies like polling. The pressure for them to appear significant is greater than ever because the primary schedule has been socrowded and truncated that the selection of a nominee could be settled only weeks after the first contests next February.
 "Every candidate tries to maximize whatever strength they have," said Senator Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat who ran for President in 1988. "I don't remember putting out phony polls, but we did other things that exaggerated my strength. If some newspaper -- even if it only had 27 circulation -- had a supportive editorial, we'd distribute that."
 (For whatever it's worth, Mr. Simon did not last past the primary in his home state.)
 Although Mr. Dole is far ahead of his rivals in almost every poll where candidates' names are used, he is going all out to remind people of his strength. So he does not have to manufacture good news.
 The others are more desperate.
 Advisers to Gov. Pete Wilson of California, determined to prove that his flagging campaign was coming on strong even before he formally announces his candidacy, called reporters to let them know that he had raised $8 million in pledges. Sounds impressive but there was no way to verify the pledges -- or, more important, that they would turn into cash.
 The campaign of Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, distributed a newsletter that trumpeted "Iowans Warming to Buchanan." Then there was this quote: "I have not seen a Presidential candidate draw such responsive crowds in this part of the state, this early, and from a candidate who has barely visited Iowa." The observer? Guy Rodgers, Mr. Buchanan's campaign manager.
 A favorite tactic is assorted "straw polls" conducted by state parties and local political organizations. Hardly scientific, these polls often have as much to do with how many tables a campaign bought at a fund-raising dinner as anything else.

 
 
This Guy's a Comer!
 After coming in second in a straw poll at a Republican convention in Oklahoma City last month, Alan L. Keyes, a twice-failed candidate for Senate from Maryland, issued a news release. "Only a month into Alan Keyes' campaign for the White House," it said, "his political star is rising fast."
 Mr. Alexander's advisers insist that their polls were far more legitimate than straw polls. But the other campaigns may disagree with the descriptions of the generic candidates proposed by Mr. Alexander's pollster, Whit Ayres. He sums up their ideology as follows:
 Candidate A (Senator Phil Gramm): "He is a staunch conservative who has concentrated on economic issues during his time in Congress, with particular emphasis on cutting spending to balance the Federal budget."
 Candidate B (Mr. Alexander): "He is a conservative who stresses personal responsibility and returning much of the power of the Federal Government to the states."
 Candidate C (Mr. Dole): "He is a conservative who emphasizes balancing the Federal budget, and he is skilled at reaching compromises."
 Candidate D (Mr. Wilson): "He is a moderate on most social and economic issues."
 Of course, Mr. Wilson probably would not describe himself as a moderate. More people would probably describe Mr. Alexander as a moderate than as a conservative. And Mr. Dole might note that he emphasizes returning power to the states.
 Donald L. Fowler, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said such polls are created out of self-interest: "It's like asking: 'If you had somebody who was the combination of John F. Kennedy, Jesus Christ and Moses, would you vote for him?' Well, I'm that person."

HEADLINE: Travel Industry Anticipates Biggest Summer Season Ever

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Spurred by an improving economy, widespread discounts and growing consumer confidence, the travel industry is anticipating America's biggest ever summer vacation season.
Because the industry defines summer as the three and a half months between Memorial Day and Labor Day, the calendar and the summer solstice notwithstanding, Summer 1995 is expected to get off to a roaring start next week when about 29.8 million travelers take advantage of the long Memorial Day weekend to visit relatives or friends, amusement parks or art museums, beaches or baccarat tables. 
 The American Automobile Association and the Air Transport Association have predicted that Memorial Day will mark the beginning of a summer of record crowds on the highways and in the air. By Labor Day, if the projections prove correct, Americans will have taken a record 230 million summer trips of 100 miles or more away from home, an increase of 2 percent over last summer. Moreover, industry officials see signs that for the first time in years, summer vacationers plan to loosen the grip on their wallets.
"Americans will take a break from the thrifty 90's and turn the clock back to the luxury 80's, as high-ticket items will be on many travelers' 'have to have' lists rather than 'wish I had' lists," said William S. Norman, chief executive of the Travel Industry Association of America, a trade group based in Washington.
In keeping with the recent trend toward shorter and more frequent getaways, 58 percent of the travelers surveyed by the association said they were planning more than one vacation this summer.
Among this season's multiple vacationers will be Provvi Panarisi and David Jakubowski, a wife and husband from Queens who find that short vacations fit well with their separate work schedules.
"We're flying to Boston next Saturday and staying through Wednesday, while we explore Cambridge and surrounding areas," said Ms. Panarisi, a sales assistant in New York for Hyatt Hotels and Resorts. "And in July we'll drive to Cape Cod to spend a few days at an inn in Falmouth, then visit Martha's Vineyard."
Tourism should also get a lift this summer from the expected huge influx of Europeans who, after exchanging their strong currency for cheap dollars, will find that prices at hotels, restaurants and just about everywhere else resemble a gigantic fire sale.
And that is good news for Death Valley National Park, which draws almost a million visitors a year.
"Almost all our summer visitors are Europeans," Ann Titus, a spokeswoman for the park, said in an interview by telephone from the park's headquarters in Furnace Creek, Calif. Summer temperatures at the park average 115 degrees, she said, "but last year's high hit 128 degrees -- that's why we don't get more Americans that time of year."
This year, gasoline is 9 cents a gallon higher than last Memorial Day. But the American Automobile Association said that gas prices adjusted for inflation are 3 cents less now than in 1990, and 26 cents less than in 1985.
"This summer a vacationing family of two adults and two children can expect to spend an average of $221.80 per day for meals, lodging and vehicle operating costs," said Graeme Clarke, a senior vice president of the association. "That compares to an inflation-adjusted $245 in 1988."
In two recent industrywide air fare sales, good for summer travel, fares were cut as much as 60 percent and allowed passengers to buy tickets 14 days in advance of travel, rather than the standard 21 days.
Moreover, cruise lines are discounting heavily for summer trips to the Caribbean and to Alaska. And hotel bargains abound, except at the most popular destinations.
The apparent anomaly of dangling discounts before record numbers of summer vacationers is not as bizarre as it may appear, travel industry experts say. It is precisely those discounts that will generate the record number of vacationers, they say. And beyond that, the airline and hotel industries -- despite slowly improving fortunes -- are still so traumatized by huge losses that they fear that higher prices will result in half-empty planes and hotel rooms.
"A strong summer is the key for the industry's financial recovery, but even a good summer like the one we are anticipating is just the start of a long road back to profitability," said Carol Hallett, president of the Air Transport Association. "After five years of losses totaling $13 billion, airlines have had to postpone the delivery of new aircraft and plans for expansion, so passengers should expect planes to be fuller than usual."
On a year-round basis, airlines on average fill about 65 percent of their seats, but Ms. Hallett's association is projecting that the averages will rise to 70 percent or 80 percent on six of the seven days between next Wednesday and May 30. The exception will be Sunday, May 28, when it is expected to fall to 63.2.
For the sixth consecutive year, Orlando, Fla., home of Disney World and Epcot Center, heads the list of most popular summer destinations, according to the automobile association. Next are Myrtle Beach, S.C., a newcomer to the list, having displaced Washington, Grand Canyon National Park, Yellowstone National Park and Williamsburg, Va.
In a poll of the five most popular destinations this summer, compiled by the American Society of Travel Agents, New York City ranked third, behind Orlando and Las Vegas, Nev.
Lucy, the six-story wood-and-tin elephant in Margate, N.J., cannot compete with the major summer vacation attractions, including the gambling casinos in nearby Atlantic City. But the 114-year-old "architectural folly," as it has been called, each summer attracts about 25,000 children and adults, who climb the spiral staircases in Lucy's legs to gaze out her eyes at the Atlantic Ocean.
"Right now we're repairing its howdah -- the seat with a canopy and railing that the maharajahs used for riding on the back of an elephant," said Josephine Harron, president of the volunteers who work with Lucy, which has been designated a National Historic Landmark. "But it'll be fixed in a few weeks, and then Lucy will be ready for what we expect will be a busy summer."

HEADLINE: In Asia, Fears U.S. Bill May Impede Boat People's Return

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, May 20

 BODY:
Legislation has been proposed in the United States Congress that could result in offers of resettlement to half the 40,000 Vietnamese boat people now facing deportation to Vietnam from camps throughout Asia.
The proposal has alarmed the United Nations and some Asian Governments because it threaten to scuttle an international effort endorsed by the Clinton Administration to send home the last of the Vietnamese in the camps. 
 The plan is contained in a foreign affairs appropriations bill drafted by House Republicans. Although the Administration opposes the measure, it has already been approved by the House International Relations Committee and is awaiting a vote before the full House.
The bill would earmark $30 million for the resettlement of up to 20,000 Vietnamese who have been seeking asylum in the United States, while placing nearly insurmountable obstacles to new American contributions to the United Nations-backed program to return the last of the boat people to Vietnam. The United States has promised to provide about $25 million to the program this year. Prospects for the legislation are uncertain.
Refugee workers say that word of the American plan has already begun circulating in detention camps in Hong Kong, and that some of the Vietnamese who had once agreed to return home voluntarily are reconsidering because of the possibility they may be allowed instead to fulfill their dream of resettlement in the United States.
"Many of these people would be refugees by any fair definition of the word," said Representative Christopher H. Smith, a New Jersey Republican who is a member of the International Relations Committee and a sponsor of the plan. "It is grotesque that we should now be paying to force them back to Vietnam."
Refugee workers say that, even if the bill is rejected by Congress or vetoed by President Clinton, the renewed debate in Washington may have convinced many Vietnamese to resist deportation, as they recognize there is still a powerful constituency willing to fight to let them into the United States.
The people now in the camps are the last of more than a million Vietnamese who fled their homeland, many in rickety boats, after the Communist troops of North Vietnam overran the southern half of the country in April 1975. Most of the so-called boat people ended up in the United States.
If the House plan became law, it would mean a reversal of American policy, which for several years has held that the vast majority of Vietnamese who remain in camps in Asia are economic migrants who have no realistic fear of persecution in Vietnam and who are thus not entitled to asylum.
Although the State Department would not be forced to offer resettlement to 20,000 Vietnamese if the bill became law, the $30 million earmarked for the program could not be spent for any other purpose.
Jahanshah Assadi, the chief of mission in Hong Kong for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, characterized the House proposal as "playing with fire."
"People in the camps are being given false hopes and false expectations," he said.
Mr. Assadi, who oversees detention camps that now hold 21,000 Vietnamese, warned that if word of the American proposal reached Vietnam, it could set off another exodus of people who would see it as a new chance to go to the United States.
"It doesn't take very much to spark that off," he said, noting that nearly 1,000 Vietnamese left the country last year in boats headed for Japan, apparently as a result of unfounded rumors that the Government was offering jobs and cash payments to migrants.
The 40,000 Vietnamese who have not been resettled or returned home have been denied status as political refugees and are waiting to be sent back to Vietnam either voluntarily or by force. In addition to the camps in Hong Kong, there are large camps in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.
The House plan has outraged officials in Hong Kong, which has been trying for years to shut the detention camps there by persuading -- or forcing -- the Vietnames to go home. The camps have turned increasingly violent as thousands of Vietnamese there face the prospect of being forced to board airplanes headed for Vietnam.
Just today, 19 Government riot officers in Hong Kong were injured as they battled Vietnamese who were protesting attempts to move them to a different camp. [In a statement early Sunday, officials in Hong Kong put the toll of injured at nearly 200, The Associated Press reported. Most of the injured were riot policemen who were using tear gas to end the demonstration and were attacked with spears and rocks, The A.P. said. The disturbances continued early Sunday.]
On May 11, 47 Hong Kong police and corrections officers were wounded, including two who were stabbed, in a battle with other Vietnamese detainees who were desperate not to return home. At least eight Vietnamese were injured.
The South China Morning Post, the city's largest English-language newspaper, suggested in an editorial on Thursday that the American plan was being offered by politicians "blind to the havoc created on this side of the Pacific by their attempts to expiate that guilt" about the plight of the boat people.
In a statement, Representative Smith contended that many of the Vietnamese now in detention camps had been unfairly denied refugee status because of inadequate screening. He said some camp residents had been "persecuted for anti-Communist political views, for religious practices or for past associations with the United States."
Because of the American involvement in the Vietnam War, he said, "we Americans have a special relationship to people who have managed to escape from Vietnam."
"These are our guys," he said. "We left them behind."
The United Nations, which is responsible for monitoring the condition of the 71,000 Vietnamese who have been returned home, says it has been unable to document a single case in which a returning migrant has faced persecution.

HEADLINE: Medicare Talk Brings Anxiety To Heartland

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: OMAHA, May 19

 BODY:
To Mike Brown, who runs a tiny county health care center about an hour's drive from here, the $250 billion or so in Medicare savings that Congressional Republicans want to achieve over the next seven years is more than an abstract figure in a Washington budget battle.
Like many rural hospitals, his center, Saunders County Health Services, ministers to a population that is largely elderly and exceedingly dependent on Medicare. The health insurance program for the elderly accounts for about 40 percent of hospital revenue nationally but for more than 80 percent of the hospital revenue at the Saunders County center. 
 As a result, Mr. Brown said one cool spring morning this week, he fears that new spending controls on Medicare would have a significant impact on his 30-bed hospital. It lost money last year, hopes to break even this year and has been struggling since the mid-1980's, he said.
In a little burst of feeling amid the dry policy talk, he argues that his center has "real value" for its aging population, often cared for by aging children, for whom the drive to Lincoln or Omaha for regular treatments would loom large.
When planners and politicians talk about potential "disruptions in the health care delivery system" from the new Republican budgets, they are often talking about hospitals like this one. But even in Omaha, in the high-rise temples of medicine that dwarf the one-story Saunders County hospital, the Medicare policies being created in Washington instill anxiety and frustration.
Hospital administrators say that they are not trying to preserve or defend the status quo and that they recognize the need for restructuring the Medicare program. But they say they have already taken numerous steps to control their costs, and they bristle at the idea that there is still a great deal of easily identifiable fat to be quickly wrung from the system. Even here in Omaha, a comparative latecomer to the competitive new world of managed care, hospitals say they have felt increasing cost pressures from private payers.
Given all these forces in play, and the expectation of new constraints on Medicaid at least as tough as those proposed for Medicare, several hospital administrators here said they feared that Congress was moving too far, too fast.
"I'm confident that we can come up with a better system for caring for Medicare patients and doing it in a more economical fashion," said Charles J. Marr, president and chief executive officer of Immanuel Medical Center, a nonprofit hospital sponsored by the Lutheran Church of America. "But they shouldn't throw us into a tailspin and force that change over a short period of time."
John M. Fraser, chief operating officer of Methodist Hospital, across town, noted more than once during an interview that he is a Republican and said both deficit reduction and Medicare overhaul were valid issues. "But you don't do this in six months on Capitol Hill," he added.
Republicans, of course, maintain that extracting these savings from Medicare is essential to insuring the continued solvency of the 30-year-old program. Under their plans, they note, spending on Medicare would continue to grow, just at a slower rate than the current average of about 10 percent a year.
Representative Jon Christensen, a Republican freshman who represents Omaha and who voted for the House Republican budget this week, declined an interview request. But in a statement he defended the plan.
"The simple fact is that Medicare is going bankrupt," he said. "Would it hurt Nebraska's hospitals less to let the Medicare program collapse?"
Many health planners dispute Mr. Christensen's argument that this level of reduction in projected spending is necessary for the sake of the Medicare system. Democrats assert that Republicans are simply using Medicare as a piggy bank to pay for their political promises of a balanced budget and a tax cut.
Nobody yet knows exactly how these spending reductions would be achieved or how much they would affect payments to hospitals; that will be resolved in Congress.
What is clear, away from Washington, is not only how enmeshed Medicare is in the health care system but also how vulnerable that system is to large-scale changes in the program.
Here in Nebraska, state officials say, it is the rural health care system that is most "fragile," as Dr. Mark Horton, the state director of health, put it. Eighteen percent of Nebraska's rural population is over 65; many of the hospitals in rural areas, and many of the primary care physicians there, are extraordinarily dependent on the Medicare program. Tinkering with its complicated reimbursement system, which some hospital officials say already makes it hard for them to recover the cost of rendering care, can thus have a major effect on the overall health system, officials say.
"You could argue that maybe some of these hospitals should close," said Dr. Horton. On the other hand, he added, these small community hospitals are often the most cost-effective places to treat common ailments like pneumonia.
Mr. Brown's center, which also depends on a county levy, includes a small attached nursing home, an outpatient clinic and a home health care agency. Its hospital beds are generally filled with patients suffering from pneumonia and other heart and lung ailments that afflict the aged, he said. There is little flexibility in his budget. "When you don't have any private paying patients to speak of," he said, "there's no place to shift the cost to."
Harlan M. Heald, president of the Nebraska Association of Health Systems, said of the expected round of spending reductions, "The more Medicare patients you have in your mix, the more it's like that old Nebraska farm joke: if you're not making back your costs, you're not going to make it up in volume."
C. Edward Schwartz, chief executive officer of the University of Nebraska Medical Center, works at the opposite end of the spectrum from Mr. Brown. Mr. Schwartz runs an academic medical center that prides itself on its liver, bone-marrow and pancreas transplant programs. Yet he too describes Medicare as "absolutely crucial" to his institution's future, in part because it recognizes and helps subsidize the cost of medical education at such centers.
Mr. Schwartz argues that the people who should be most alarmed about new controls on Medicare are private employers, because hospitals could be driven to renewed cost shifting. "We have to be honest with ourselves," he said, adding, "I thought business was well past the point of wanting to pay the taxes Congress didn't want to collect."
The debate over Medicare, in short, looks decidedly less abstract at the grass roots, a fact that opponents of Republican proposal are counting on in the coming months.
Diana Smalley, chief executive officer of Midlands Community Hospital, a 208-bed center south of Omaha, said she was looking forward to putting together a health forum for Representative Christensen, whom she met at a recent function of the local Chamber of Commerce. As head of the chamber, Mrs. Smalley is more than able to brief her Congressman on the importance of her hospital to the community's economy. It is the largest civilian employer in the county, she noted.
"I'd rather work with him if I can," she said. "I admire, I guess you could say, the zeal that we see to get things done. I just worry about the time frame."

HEADLINE: PATAKI IN ACCORD WITH LAWMAKERS ON TAX-CUT PLAN

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 20

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki and the state's legislative leaders have agreed on a three-year plan to cut state income taxes that would give two-thirds of all taxpayers a 25 percent reduction in rates by 1997, state officials disclosed today.
The agreement represents a compromise between the Governor, a Republican, and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat. Mr. Pataki wanted a four-year plan that would have cut rates for everyone by 25 percent. Mr. Silver wanted a less expensive two-year plan that would have given a larger share of the savings to low-income and middle-income New Yorkers. 
 Under the compromise, the greatest benefit would go to those with adjusted gross incomes of $55,000 or less, according to the state officials, who insisted on anonymity. People earning less than $55,000 would see their top tax rates drop by 25 percent by 1997. Those earning more than $55,000 would have their top rates fall by 13 percent.
State officials estimate that a family of four making $50,000 a year and claiming the standard deduction would pay $663 less in taxes for 1997 than for 1994. If the same family made $100,000 and itemized its deductions, its estimated savings would be $868, the officials said.
The tax cut agreement now becomes the driving force behind the budget that ultimately will be enacted in Mr. Pataki's first year and that will represent an uneasy consensus between the Republicans and Democrats who share power in Albany. The tax cut reflects the new priority placed on tax relief after years of unchecked growth in state spending.
The tax cut deal was settled late this week during closed-door budget discussions involving Mr. Pataki, Mr. Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican. The three leaders said on Friday that they hoped to complete their budget negotiations before Memorial Day. This year's impasse -- the fiscal year started on April 1 -- is one of the longest in state history.
In recent weeks, the negotiations on tax cuts became intertwined with talks on Mr. Pataki's proposals for deep reductions in welfare spending. In the end, Mr. Silver, who must satisfy an ideologically diverse group of Democrats, agreed to a deeper tax cut than he wanted. And Mr. Pataki agreed to arrange the tax cut more to Mr. Silver's liking and to drop his demand for the biggest welfare cuts, which would have reduced benefit levels and imposed time limits on payments to able-bodied recipients.
Even so, lawmakers and gubernatorial aides have predicted that the remaining spending cuts will be so severe that many Democrats in the Assembly will vote against the budget. That would force Mr. Silver to seek votes from the Republican minority to pass the budget, which would be extremely rare in Albany.
The state officials who disclosed details about the tax cut agreement said it was firm. But there is always the potential of its falling apart if negotiations on the larger budget agreement break down.
Last week, it became clear that Mr. Pataki and the legislative leaders were nearing the end of their grueling negotiations, which were embittered by high political stakes and intense ideological combat between new players.
The leaders are still discussing how to cut Medicaid, how to finance criminal justice programs and how to pay for athletic stadium construction projects around the state. But they have essentially agreed on most major issues, including a slight increase in financing for schools and cuts that would leave state university students with a tuition increase of about $750 a year. Total state spending, which Mr. Pataki had hoped to reduce by 3.5 percent, would drop by about 1 percent, state officials said.
Mr. Pataki made his promise of a 25 percent tax cut the centerpiece of his 1994 campaign, arguing that a large cut would be essential to New York's economic recovery. The Governor is expected to push for further income tax relief next year.
Despite pressure from more liberal Democrats to resist the tax-cutting fever generated by Mr. Pataki's election, Mr. Silver announced early this year that the Assembly Democrats would also support a reduction. But with the state already facing a budget gap of more than $4 billion, he argued that a tax cut as large as Mr. Pataki's would require unacceptable reductions in spending on education and social programs.
The compromise tax-cut package would cost the state $555 million in revenues in the 1995 tax year, $2.2 billion in 1996 and just over $3.5 billion in 1997, the state officials said. Other state officials said the value of the tax cut in the third year could be as high as $3.8 billion. The income tax is the largest single source of revenue for the state, accounting for $17.6 billion of the state's $33.4 billion general fund budget last year.
Mr. Pataki's original income tax cut proposal would have cost $720 million this year, $2.1 billion in 1996, $4.4 billion in 1997, and $6.8 billion in 1998. Mr. Silver's plan would have cost $720 million in 1995 and $1.7 billion in 1996.
Under the income tax agreement, there would be five income brackets, as now. But the boundaries of those brackets would change, as would the tax rates, meaning that fewer people would pay the top rate and it would be lower.
For instance, the top tax rate, currently 7.875 percent for married filers with taxable incomes of $26,000 and above and single filers with incomes of $13,000 and above, would be reduced gradually to 7.59375 percent for 1995, 7.125 percent for 1996 and 6.85 percent for 1997. The top bracket would be changed to include only married filers making $40,000 and above and single filers making $20,000 and above.
The Governor and legislative leaders have also agreed to the broad outlines of a plan that would require recipients of Home Relief, the welfare program for childless, able-bodied adults, to work off their benefits in jobs with government or nonprofit agencies. If they miss work once without a legitimate excuse, their benefits would be suspended for 90 days. A second absence would bring a 150-day suspension. A third violation would mean a 180-day cutoff.
While Mr. Pataki apparently will win his demand for workfare, he failed to persuade the Assembly Democrats to reduce benefit levels for welfare recipients and to limit payments to those recipients to 60 days.
But the welfare agreement will apparently include a requirement that recipients keep their children in school or face a loss of some benefits. The sanctions would take effect after a student is truant three times in one quarter and would apply to students through the sixth grade.
Other welfare changes would tighten eligibility screening, as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has done in New York City, and strengthen fraud detection. Electronic fingerprinting of welfare applicants, an anti-fraud measure, would become mandatory in all counties.
Youngsters under 18 who are on welfare would be required to live at home rather than in their own households, unless they could demonstrate a well-founded fear of abuse. New residents of the state would be limited to the welfare benefits paid in their former states for the first six months they live in New York.
While they are still discussing details of Medicaid cuts, the leaders have agreed to reduce the $1.2 billion reduction proposed by Mr. Pataki to a cut of $500 million to $700 million, state officials said.
The leaders have also agreed to use Urban Development Corporation bonding to buy two New York City jails that primarily house state inmates, giving Mr. Giuliani a $120 million infusion for his budget. In light of the state's deep financial problems, resistance has dropped to a "Quick Draw" video lottery game expected to raise about $100 million.
In addition to the income tax cut, the leaders have also agreed, according to state officials, to enact $50 million worth of cuts in business taxes. Legislative aides said the business taxes would grow to $170 million in 1996 and to $250 million to $300 million in 1997.
They have yet to make final decisions on which business taxes will be cut and by how much. But container taxes on soda and beer would probably be cut in half; the petroleum business tax would be reduced for trucks, airplanes and nonprofit organizations; the estate tax would be exempted for homes worth up to $250,000, and the parimutuel tax would be cut. Still under consideration are cuts in taxes on sales of real estate for more than $1 million, and on utilities.
The leaders have also agreed to Mr. Pataki's proposal to accelerate the phased enactment of the state's earned income tax credit for the working poor, which was first approved last year. Under the new plan, the state credit would jump from 10 percent of the Federal Government's credit this year to 20 percent in 1996, rather than 10 percent this year to 15 percent in 1996 and 20 percent in 1997.


GRAPHIC: Taxpayers' bill would be cut in two ways under the agreement reached in Albany: through a lower tax rate and a different tax bracket structure, which would raise the cutoff for the top bracket. Because what individual taxpayers pay is greatly affected by the deductions they claim, state officials estimated the adjusted gross incomes of each tax bracket.

HEADLINE: Strapped for Money, Washington Suffers Indignities and Insults

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
A financial crisis is one thing. No toilet paper is quite another.
While the Clinton Administration prepares to name a control board to oversee the District of Columbia's finances, an action expected next week, and Republican members of Congress continue studying how to improve city agencies, local residents are enduring the effects of the District's $722 million budget deficit in ways large, small and annoying. 
 Garbage pickups have been reduced. City employees have been forced to take furloughs and pay cuts. The housing authority has been placed in receivership. And now, with insufficient funds to pay city vendors, restrooms in municipal buildings have no toilet paper.
"Can you imagine the nation's capital, there's all kinds of jokes flying around," Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. said this week.
Mr. Barry expressed all due embarrassment but quickly blamed the City Council for cutting the $28 million budget of the Department of Administrative Services to $10.7 million. He vetoed the cut, but the Council overrode his veto.
The city owes more than $30 million to about 500 vendors, and it owes $1.25 million alone to the CPF Corporation, which cleans and maintains 34 municipal buildings. This week the company drew the line. Its crews cleaned restrooms in the buildings but stopped restocking toilet paper. That sent several managers scurrying to nearby drug stores to buy supplies, and some municipal workers began bringing their own.
"Look, we're slow pay, and we're going to be until we come out of this," Johnny Allem, a spokesman for Mr. Barry, said today. "Out of nowhere, the Council cut our budget on this after the city spent $28 million every year for these expenses. We've long since exceeded $10 million in spending this year."
Critics of the city's administration said that the toilet paper shortage was an appropriate symbol for a city going down a fiscal drain and strongly reflects the reasons Congress passed legislation to create an oversight board.
The five-member panel to be appointed by President Clinton will have final say over all financial operations of the city, which grew worse through the administration of Mr. Barry's predecessor, Sharon Pratt Kelly.
In addition, Speaker Newt Gingrich has asked several of his Republican colleagues to examine city agencies and recommend changes to make them more efficient.
Mr. Barry, who blames Mrs. Kelly for the debts and inefficiencies he inherited, said he welcomed their suggestions as long as lawmakers solicit ideas from residents before making any final pronouncements.
Using the city's beleaguered schools as an example, he said: "Gingrich knows the D.C. education system needs reform. I know it needs reform. The question is how are we going to do it?"
Mr. Barry has tried to weather the storm stoically, proclaiming the worst of the crisis has passed and things are under control.
Even with his wife, Cora Masters Barry, under investigation by local and Federal authorities over accusations that she helped divert campaign funds last year, Mr. Barry felt comfortable enough with the city's predicament to spend 10 days this month touring West Africa, ostensibly to drum up tourism and business interest for Washington.
One Ivory Coast village, Sikensi, was so honored to have Mr. Barry and his wife visit that village leaders crowned them King Yede and Queen Hypo and gave them an acre of land.
Then, they asked Mr. Barry for $130,000 to build a new town hall.

HEADLINE: How the Clinton Administration Reversed U.S. Policy on Cuban Refugees

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
It took just over a month for a small group of top Clinton Administration officials to overturn 30 years of American policy toward Cuba.
The process started when Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, went to the Oval Office one Friday afternoon in late March to deliver a warning. He told President Clinton of the rage building among the thousands of Cubans detained at the Guantanamo Bay naval base -- a warning that the general in charge of the region was starting to send up the Pentagon chain of command. 
 "I told the President there was an increasingly unsustainable situation at the Guantanamo camp," Senator Graham said.
Two weeks earlier, he had visited the refugees, who were being detained indefinitely after setting sail last August. "It couldn't last through the summer without the strong potential of a riot," he said.
The process ended in a series of secret meetings between a top State Department official and a confidant of President Fidel Castro in a New York bar and a Toronto hotel -- meetings that culminated in a deal, announced on May 2, that the Administration called a breakthrough and that many Cuban-Americans have called a betrayal.
The deal had two prongs. First, President Clinton decided to admit the 21,000 Cubans at Guantanamo, brushing aside a vow never to allow them on American shores.
The second prong was an even more stunning reversal: Cubans picked up at sea would be returned to their Communist-ruled island, scrapping the 35-year-old policy against sending intercepted boat people back to Cuba.
The new policy came under heavy attack at a House subcommittee hearing on Thursday when Democratic lawmakers joined their Republican counterparts and Cuban-American leaders to denounce the policy reversal as well as the secrecy with which it was made. The Administration fears a similar assault at a Senate hearing on Cuba scheduled in the coming week.
For a foreign policy team known for leaks, indecisiveness and delays, the policy shift was uncharacteristic. It was made swiftly, secretly and with a willingness to offend powerful constituent groups that it had long courted. And, because the matter was so explosive, it was handled by an unusually small group of advisers, leaving out those who were likely to object.
Even so, interviews with Administration officials, members of Congress and Florida officials indicate that the process in a larger sense was characteristic of an Administration in which foreign policy has often been made more in response to pressing, practical problems than on the basis of longer-term strategies or strongly held beliefs.
Moreover, in this case the new Cuba policy was a practical fix to the problems created by an earlier practical fix. When the Administration last August sought to deter Cuban refugees by sending them to Guantanamo, it abandoned a three-decade practice of granting asylum to most Cubans who flee their homeland for the United States. It was warned that sooner or later it would face this quandary: if they can't stay in Guantanamo forever, where will they go?
Senator Graham hammered that point home to Mr. Clinton at the very time that Gen. John J. Sheehan, chief of the Atlantic Command, was starting to warn the Pentagon that Guantanamo was turning into a tinderbox.
"It was not a long-term solution to leave 15 or 20 thousand migrants permanently in the camp at Guantanamo," General Sheehan said in an interview. "Civil disturbance was clearly an option."
Mr. Graham and General Sheehan made the same recommendation: the more than 20,000 Cubans there should be admitted to the United States.
But it was clear to all that this solution could create another explosive problem. As soon as the Guantanamo detainees were allowed into the country in large numbers, many of the 11 million people in Cuba might be encouraged to set to sea, confident that they, too, would be taken to a haven in Guantanamo and then ultimately to Florida.
This was the same pressure that had forced the decision last summer to vow never to admit that wave of refugees.
One of the last things the White House wants is a new tidal wave of Cuban boat people, least of all as the 1996 Presidential campaign heats up, because it could cripple Mr. Clinton's already troubled prospects in Florida, a key state.
After meeting with Senator Graham, the President handed the problem to his national security advisers. Samuel R. Berger, the deputy national security adviser, became the point man, and he brought in just two other officials to work on the issue with him: Morton H. Halperin, a senior aide, and Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff.
By early April, Administration officials say, Mr. Berger, Mr. Halperin and Mr. Tarnoff agreed that the Cubans at Guantanamo should be allowed in.
But the only outsiders they consulted, Senator Graham and Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida, also a Democrat, warned of political complications: Floridians might hold it against Mr. Clinton in 1996 if the Guantanamo Cubans were seen as another tidal wave of immigrants.
To get around this, they suggested that the Guantanamo Cubans be included as part of a quota of 20,000 Cubans allowed in each year, and not added on top of it. Last September the Administration agreed to that quota as part of a deal to persuade Havana to stop the exodus of boat people the month before.
Persuading Mr. Castro to include them as part of the 20,000 quota might be hard, the Administration feared, because he treated that quota as a safety valve for pushing out dissidents.
Complicating matters, Governor Chiles opposed admitting the Guantanamo Cubans unless there was a muscular interdiction policy.
So the President's advisers sifted through four options: allow future Cuban boat people into the United States, send them to third countries, hold them in Guantanamo or return them to Cuba.
Admitting future boat people was rejected because it would lead to a new exodus, while sending them to third countries was dismissed in light of the Administration's past difficulties in getting other countries to take Cubans. And sending future boat people to Guantanamo was ruled out because it would create the very problem the Administration was wrestling with.
"There was a consensus right away," one official said. Consensus was made easy because the policy review excluded officials who were likely to object. Also left out were Cuban-American leaders like Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman of the powerful Cuban-American National Foundation, whom the Administration consulted in the crisis last August.
"We wanted to keep this to a very small circle," a senior official said. The fear was that if such an explosive policy change leaked out, it would be derailed.
In mid-April, President Clinton approved the two-pronged plan to empty Guantanamo and return Cubans.
On April 17, Mr. Tarnoff flew to New York, ostensibly for a conference on the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. But the main reason was to present the Administration's proposal secretly to Ricardo Alarcon, the longtime diplomat and Castro confidant who heads Cuba's Parliament.
That evening Mr. Tarnoff met the Cuban over drinks in a hotel bar near the United Nations. "He was interested but guarded," a senior Administration official said. "He had to report back to Havana."
Mr. Alarcon complained about the three-decade-old trade embargo, and a Republican-sponsored bill to tighten it, but Mr. Tarnoff said he was there to discuss just one thing: immigration. To the Cuban-American groups that learned of the talks later, Washington's willingness to hold such high-level talks was a dangerous step toward "normalization."
The next day, Mr. Alarcon met at the United States Mission to the United Nations with Dennis Hays, the State Department's coordinator of Cuban affairs, for previously scheduled talks about carrying out last September's immigration agreement. Mr. Hays, a hard-liner who has opposed cooperating with Mr. Castro, was left in the dark about the high-stakes talks the night before.
Although it was hard to predict Mr. Castro's response, the Administration believed that it was pushing on an open door. Havana had never hid its unhappiness about the more than 20,000 anti-Castro Cubans in Guantanamo -- if unrest exploded there, it could sow disorder elsewhere on the island.
The American proposal was attractive to Cuba in another way: normalizing immigration policy could stimulate investment, since it could give foreigners the impression that normalized economic relations might soon follow.
The way Americans saw it, as the price for the benefits of the accord, Cuba would agree to let the Guantanamo Cubans be counted among the 60,000 Cubans to be admitted over three years under the quota system.
After Mr. Alarcon consulted in Havana for a week, he called Mr. Tarnoff to say the Cuban Government liked the proposals. He urged Mr. Tarnoff to meet him in Toronto the weekend of April 29 and 30. Negotiating in a hotel suite there, they pieced together an accord.
Late that Sunday, they returned to their capitals to show the agreement to their superiors. After a few small adjustments were made, the two men talked on the telephone at noon on Monday. They had a deal.
Even though the policy shift has flopped with Cuban-Americans in Miami, Administration officials say they believe that it will be a political plus because most Floridians want firmer controls on immigration.
"Florida's two leading politicians told us that most Floridians would accept this without much of a problem," a senior official said. "So far that seems to be the case."

HEADLINE: Imperiled Agencies Mount Life-Saving Efforts

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
Republicans often portray Federal agencies as slothful, lethargic, unresponsive. But many agencies have snapped into action in the last two weeks, galvanized by Republican plans to end their existence or cut their budgets.
The agencies on the Republican hit list are mobilizing supporters and deploying their troops on Capitol Hill, pleading with Congress to spare them. Among them are the Departments of Energy, Commerce and Education, the Voice of America, the Agency for International Development and the National Endowment for the Arts. 
 Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary told Congress this week that her agency was needed to guarantee civilian control of nuclear weapons, and she said that computers built to design such weapons now had myriad civilian uses, at textile factories and in other industries.
Clifton R. Gaus, head of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, an arm of the Public Health Service with 270 employees and a budget of $163 million this year, argued that his agency actually saved money for the Government by controlling health costs. Guidelines developed by the agency had shown that cataract surgery, prostate surgery and back surgery are often unnecessary, he said.
His message to Congress was simple: "We are not part of the problem. We are part of the solution to Medicare's budget problems."
The House budget resolution would eliminate the health policy agency. The Senate would cut its budget by 75 percent, on the ground that its work could be "more appropriately performed by the private sector."
The Agency for International Development has infuriated some Republicans with the intensity of its lobbying. Somehow the Republicans obtained a copy of an internal memorandum in which a top Agency for International Development official described the Administration's strategy: "delay, postpone, obfuscate, derail" the Republican plan. It also used the phrase "backdoor isolationist" to describe lawmakers who want to cut foreign aid.
The Administration is fiercely resisting Congressional efforts to merge the Agency for International Development, the United States Information Agency and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency into the State Department, saying that the agencies should retain a large degree of independence.
Officials from these agencies have fanned out across Capitol Hill to spread their message, and Jay Byrne, a spokesman for A.I.D., said his agency had begun "an intensive public outreach and information campaign."
At a recent hearing of the Committee on International Relations, Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, asked people in the room who actually worked for the affected agencies to stand up. More than three-fourths of the 200 people in the audience rose, the Congressman recalled.
"Usually, you have outside interest groups swarming around," Mr. Rohrabacher said in an interview. "But today you have as many people from inside the Government as from outside the Government lobbying Congress. It's like a big battlefield. Republican forces are on the offensive, and you have all these Government bureaucrats fortifying the high ground to beat back the attack."
Senator Craig Thomas, Republican of Wyoming, said he was incensed by the attitude of Agency for International Development officials. "Instead of looking for ways to work with members of Congress to streamline its operations, cut waste and bloating, and accept the downsizing that the American people expect of every other agency of the Federal Government," Mr. Thomas said, "A.I.D. has taken on, as its first priority, saving its own skin."
J. Brian Atwood, administrator of the Agency for International Development, said, "I am not intimidated by those who would prefer that I keep my mouth shut." And he insisted that members of Congress trying to cut the foreign affairs budget were "leading us to isolationism through the back door."
To fend off budget-cutters, the agency highlights its efforts to combat the deadly Ebola virus in Zaire; the agency is coordinating the United States response to the health crisis.
And the agency says the budget cuts contemplated by Congress would have "truly horrific" results: fewer children immunized, fewer condoms distributed, more unsafe abortions and more cases of AIDS around the world.
Some agencies on the chopping block are old, like the Interstate Commerce Commission, created in 1887 to regulate railroads. Others are newcomers like the Corporation for National Service, created in 1993 to run the volunteer program known as Americorps.
The House and Senate Budget Committees both recommend abolishing Americorps, with its budget of $575 million. This is a slap at President Clinton, who proposed increasing the number of volunteers to 47,000 from the current 20,000.
Americorps officials said they had little hope of changing the budget resolutions. But they are pleading with friends and supporters on the Appropriations Committees, which could provide money for Americorps if they made deeper cuts at other agencies. Americorps has invited members of Congress to visit its volunteers at work in elementary schools and homeless shelters around the country.
"To eliminate this agency would be tragic, like killing a puppy," said Jay Toscano, a spokesman for Americorps. "The Republicans should use this agency as a model, not a target."
Some agencies threatened with extinction, like the Legal Services Corporation and the Education Department, have overcome similar threats in the past. But some, like the National Institutes of Health, which have enjoyed strong bipartisan support, now face significant budget cuts for the first time.

HEADLINE: The Fresh Aid Fund;
'Shadowing' the Music Professionals

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
Yahaira Vargas was looking forward to working with Mariah Carey again.
"She's like a little kid, but as an adult," said Yahaira, who is 13, as she and six other youngsters waited for Ms. Carey, the pop singer, to emerge from the studio where she was recording a new album. Just then, she burst into the waiting room and began a raid on the group's McDonald's Happy Meals. 
 "You guys don't want those prizes?" Ms. Carey asked. "Can I have them?"
Aside from that, Ms. Carey, who at the age of 25 has already sold more than 55 million records, was all business at a "job shadowing" event organized by the Fresh Air Fund. The children, music-minded seventh and eighth graders from all over New York City, had come to the Hit Factory on 54th Street in Manhattan to learn about the recording industry by shadowing professionals on the job.
Ms. Carey is a special friend to the fund. Last year, she donated $1 million to the fund for a career awareness camp in Fishkill, N.Y., which is now named for her. The seven youngsters are among the 2,900 economically disadvantaged New York City children who will attend Fresh Air camps this summer. Yahaira, a South Bronx resident, and several others were returning to Camp Mariah for a second year.
Ms. Carey, wearing dark glasses and black nail polish and redolent of strawberry chewing gum, ushered her young charges into a control room lined with a Star Trek-like array of sleek black gizmos, buttons and lights.
First she let them grill her producer, Jermaine Dupri, a 23-year-old who produced his first record at 14 and now boasts a hit rap record, "Funkdafied," by Da Brat, and his own label, So So Def.
"What's your greatest pleasure in your job?" asked Sonseray Cummings, 13.
"Seeing a group that I create from scratch grow into something that everybody knows," Mr. Dupri replied.
"What's your ambition?" someone else asked.
"I want to write big songs that stay around," Mr. Dupri said. "Maybe one of you all will do them over someday."
Then Ms. Carey introduced her engineer, Jay Healy, commander of the 72-track console. Mr. Healy punched a command into his computer and 72 volume controls slid up and down in a neatly choreographed dance.
Mr. Healy, who broke into the business answering phones at the Hit Factory 12 years ago, added, "There are schools and colleges and programs you can go to, but there's no substitute for working on the board."
The theme, as at fund job shadowings in law offices, restaurants, hospitals and other work places, was to emphasize that in any field there are many kinds of jobs.
"Kids today know about poor people and they know about doctors and lawyers and stars, but they don't know too much about the vast middle," said Jenny Morgenthau, executive director of the Fresh Air Fund. "In music, you can be the technician, the marketer, the makeup person, the receptionist."
Finally it was time to get to work. Ms. Carey led the youngsters into the recording studio, a dramatically lighted wood-paneled room the size of a school gym but with considerably better acoustics. She handed out headphones and had them sing a chorus of "Hero," one of her biggest hits and a song she said she wrote with young people in mind.
Everyone knew the words. "When you feel like hope is gone," they sang, "look inside you and be strong. And you'll finally see the truth, that the hero lies in you."
After seven takes, some really loud and some just whispering, Ms. Carey invited the children back into the control room. Mr. Healy hit a switch and a 49-voice children's chorus swelled into being, rich voices filled with emotion and deft imitations of Ms. Carey's trademark swoops and glides.
"I'm going to keep that one," Ms. Carey said. "I might use it someday." She had the kids record a new outgoing message on her answering machine and bade them farewell.
Back in the waiting room, everyone was raving. Aurelius Mayfield, a gangly 12-year-old choirboy from Coney Island in a Camp Mariah sweatshirt, was just about speechless.
"That was so . . . wonderful!" he said. "She's so wonderful, she's just wonderful, and she's nice and so pretty and the way she sings is just wonderful."
Andrae Mitchell, a pint-sized aspiring talk-show host from East New York, was considerably more composed.
"You know," he said, "People think artists are tired after doing all this work for everybody, and that they're so hard, but if you just sit down and talk to them one on one without the middleman, everything goes easy."
Lisa Watson, the Fresh Air Fund's career awareness director, reminded the young people that Ms. Carey had a good reason to be in such a good mood.
"She was having a good time because she was in her element, doing what makes her happy," Ms. Watson said. "Everyone should pursue careers that make them happy. You should follow your heart, no matter what people tell you."
It costs $912 to send a child to Fresh Air camp. Tax-deductible contributions may be sent to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018. People wishing to volunteer for the fund's camping and career awareness programs may call (212) 221-0900.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Japan, a Frog and a Pail

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
After the U.S. imposed trade sanctions on Japan last week, I found myself thinking back to that old science class experiment where the teacher puts a frog in a pail of water on the stove and gradually turns up the heat. The frog, which is very good at adapting, adjusts to each new level of heat. Eventually, though, the frog boils to death, because it is so good at adapting it never thinks to jump out of the pail.
 The Japanese have become so good at adapting to trade threats and the ever-rising value of the yen that instead of doing what a normal country would do -- jump out of the pail by opening its economy -- the Japanese simply keep the foreigners out and adapt to the consequences. They just tighten their belts another notch, sacrifice some profits and move their factories to lower-cost labor markets around Asia. 
 But with the U.S. having just slapped a 100 percent tariff on Japanese luxury cars and, more importantly, with the yen having soared in value by 20 percent this past year, making everything Japan sells here 20 percent more expensive, what will Japan do now? Jump, adapt or finally boil into stagnation?
 My guess is that Japan will try to adapt again, and not open its markets. The Japanese Government is too weak to take the tough steps to deregulate its economy, and its instinct for adapting to foreign pressures is too deeply ingrained. That's why President Clinton was right to raise the stakes to a boil. The President's only option is to create so much pain for Japanese manufacturers -- and so much pleasure for Japanese consumers, by weakening the dollar and making U.S. goods temptingly cheap to buy -- that instead of trying to adapt, they will finally work to remove Japan's trade barriers.
 I hope Mr. Clinton has the stomach to keep the heat on, because here's how I think Japan will initially respond: Japanese businesses will use the strong yen to buy, at bargain-basement prices, more and more factories in cheap labor markets around Asia. This will lower their production costs and nullify the effects of the higher yen on their exports. Sure, Japanese companies may have to eat some losses this quarter. But Japan, unlike America, doesn't worry about quarterly profits. It worries about quarter-century profits, and in a quarter century, with the yen having such buying power, Japan will own every other factory from southern China to Burma. So the U.S. can bar all Japan's exports, and Japan will just slip them in through these other markets.
 True, this will mean fewer jobs in Japan, and a hollowing out of its economy, and that in itself will force Japan to import more from abroad. But the Japanese aren't just going to sit back and live off their investments in Asia. If history is any guide, they will also adapt by finding more efficient ways to produce in the industries they do keep at home. With the strong yen forcing them to streamline in order to stay competitive, Japanese companies will move even faster into the knowledge-intensive, high-wage, high-skilled economy of tomorrow that the U.S. still dreams of.
 No, no, say the classical economists. This time Japan won't be able to adapt. This time they jump or boil. Oh? That's what they said when oil prices quadrupled in the 1970's, but Japan adapted. That's what they said when the yen rose by 50 percent in the 1980's, but Japan adapted. Only a fool would bet against them trying to adapt again, while opening their markets as little as possible.
 Unless one thing happens: Japanese consumers decide they are tired of tightening their belts, living in houses the size of a walk-in closet and being the world's richest country and poorest people. That would be nice, but history also teaches that there is a deep cultural tradition in Japan, shared even by many Japanese consumers, that consumer welfare must always give way to the national welfare, and the national welfare is to win the 100-year trade war, not the battle of 1995.
 But hey, if you think this time Japan can't adapt and will open instead, then buy Ford Motor stock; they make a hot little right-hand-drive Mustang for the Japan market. If you think Japan can adapt, without opening much, then buy the yen. That's the bet. The structure of U.S.-Japan competition in the 21st century is riding on the outcome.

The Unkindest Cut

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
High up on any list of ain't-broke, don't-fix-'em institutions is America's huge web of universities. As Vartan Gregorian, the president of Brown, puts it: "As many as three-quarters of the best universities in the world are located in the United States. What sector of our economy or society can make a similar claim?"
 But Dr. Gregorian -- in a powerful, post-election speech to the National Press Club in Washington last fall and in a phone conversation last week -- now feels he must campaign for the American university's survival, and fast. Why? The Republican budget plans sailing through the 104th Congress would end a 50-year government-university partnership that has made our country's higher education the best. 
 For all the talk about funding cutbacks in student loans, surprisingly little attention has been paid to how the G.O.P. budget will damage the educational institutions themselves. Now reality is setting in. As Harvey Fineberg, the dean of Harvard's School of Public Health, said in an interview last week: "We thought the case was so self-evident we didn't think the cutbacks were actually going to happen. Now that the proposals have come forward, people are just dumbstruck."
 The G.O.P. assault on higher education began not as a budget-balancing strategy but as an ideological campaign in this winter's Congressional hearings on the National Endowment for the Humanities. Arguing that the N.E.H. should be abolished, representatives of right-wing think tanks led by William Bennett and Lynne Cheney condemned universities en masse as subversive hotbeds of political correctness.
 Are there indeed the radical feminists and multiculturalists that Mr. Bennett decries on campus? Of course. Do some of them get N.E.H. grants? Yes -- and why not, given that they're Americans too? But the Bennett-Cheney characterization of academia was an indiscriminate smear, as was their description of the N.E.H. The endowment's typical (and largest) grants go not for Marxist deconstructions of "I Love Lucy" but to underwrite Euripides translations (University of Virginia), or edit the papers of Andrew Johnson (University of Tennessee), or assist an archeological dig (University of Wyoming).
 Just the same, the Bennett-Cheney strategy did the deed; under the House budget proposal, the N.E.H. will be killed.
 With respect for our universities so low in the new Congress, it was inevitable that no one would think twice about axing the Federal contribution to academic science research as well. One example: The proposed cuts at the National Institutes of Health alone will radically alter the nation's medical schools, given that roughly 16 percent of their income derives from Federal research grants, mainly from the N.I.H.
 In practical terms, Dr. Fineberg explains, this is "like eating the seed corn." Fewer grants will slow scientific breakthroughs in disease prevention and cure, which from the Salk vaccine to recent advances in breast cancer have mostly happened at American universities. With less research come fewer opportunities to nurture new researchers. "We will destroy the future by turning a generation of would-be scientists away," Dr. Fineberg says.
 Ask G.O.P. leaders how universities will replace Federal funding, and the mantra-like answer is "privatization." But lately industry has paid for only 7 percent of academic scientific research and development, compared with the Federal Government's 57 percent. "Anyone who dreams these cuts will be replaced though private philanthropy or industry is fooling himself," says Dr. Fineberg. The research that might unlock the genetic origins of a disease, after all, does not immediately produce a product industry can sell.
 Just as bleak are prospects for privatization in the humanities. Richard Ekman of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has calculated that the N.E.H., tiny as it is, gives three times as much to the humanities as all the private foundations in America combined -- which makes it "highly unlikely" that those foundations can even begin to replace the endowment's support of university scholarship. If it's dumb and dumber this country wants, it couldn't find a more foolproof scenario than the one now being drafted on Capitol Hill.

HEADLINE: Forever In Debt

BYLINE: By Paul Johnson; Paul Johnson, author, most recently, of "Modern Times: The World From the Twenties to the Nineties," is at work on a new book, "A History of the United States People."

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
The U.S. national debt is $4.7 trillion and increasing by $38,158 every four seconds, as a clock posted in the House Budget Committee hearing room reminds us. On Thursday, the House approved a proposal to balance the budget by the year 2002; the Senate is scheduled to vote on its own plan this week. But whatever compromise plan emerges, even if made law, will not necessarily balance the budget: it will only set spending goals. Congress can ignore those goals just as it did those set by the deficit-reduction bills passed in the mid-1980's.
 Meanwhile, the debt mounts, and no one, it seems, has a long-term proposal to get rid of it altogether. The burden the country will almost certainly lay on the shoulders of its children in the 21st century is disgraceful. 
 Americans are historically hard-working and provident, and rightly proud that they live in the world's most powerful democracy and its oldest republic. So how did they get into this mess?
 It is comparatively recent. The United States has a long record of sound public finance, ever since Alexander Hamilton took over the Treasury in 1789 and introduced fiscal realism, balancing the budget for the first time. In 1835, President Andrew Jackson actually contrived to eliminate the debt altogether. Thereafter the debt fluctuated, as is reasonable, according to the emergencies through which the nation passed. The Civil War, World War I, the Great Depression and World War II all led to large-scale increases in the public debt. But the calms that followed these storms all saw it systematically reduced. During the last period of debt reduction, 1946 to 1975, it was cut by half.
 Then an odd and sinister thing happened. Without any emergency or world war or even a deep recession, the debt began to rise. At the beginning of Ronald Reagan's Presidency, it had reached $914 billion; on his retirement, it was $3 trillion. Today, of course, the debt is closing in on $5 trillion, so it is not surprising that the dollar is at a historic low against the yen and the German mark. Indeed, it could be argued that the dollar's reputation is more fragile now than at any time since the 1780's.
 The reasons are not far to seek: huge increases in Government employees (well over 20 percent of the work force) and in unfunded long-term liabilities (over $15 trillion), and, not least, a colossal commitment to transfer payments ($300 billion for poverty relief alone this year).
 The United States is running the most costly welfare state in history, as well as acting -- reluctantly and not consistently but certainly expensively -- as the world's policeman.
 Even to eliminate the deficit, let alone reduce the debt, Federal spending will have to be fundamentally reformed. This will mean, among other things, ending the welfare state as it exists today. It may not be as hard as some people think -- after all, it is scarcely a generation old.
 But if at the same time taxes are also to be reduced -- at between 35 and 40 percent of personal income they are a real brake on economic dynamism -- then the cuts must be not only deep but ubiquitous. The Government must go from being a prodigal to a frugal -- better yet, a stingy -- spender.

That is by no means impossible. If Congress wants to know how a Scrooge-like mentality operates, it need only study almost any Treasury correspondence dating from 1815 to 1860. For the reform to become reality, however, there are three political prerequisites.
 The first is sufficient Congressional support. That has already been achieved. For the first time in 40 years -- longer than the U.S. welfare state has existed in fully developed form -- the Scrooges have taken over from the Micawbers. There appears to be a majority in both the House and Senate for some sort of balanced-budget strategy, and the momentum for reform appears to be growing.
 The second prerequisite is a popular consensus. Every sign indicates that there is one. The nation appears to be in the mood to do the right thing, even if it means sacrifices. Public opinion surveys, including a New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted in April, all seem to indicate a new spirit of fiscal rectitude among ordinary people. When asked to choose between a tax cut and balancing the budget, a majority chose the budget.
 Congress is ready for reform; so are the people. But history shows that neither means much without a dedicated leader.
 Normally one would expect such leadership to come from the President. In the past, the White House has shown a much greater concern for financial probity than Capitol Hill. When Congress passed Mr. Clinton's deficit-reduction package during his first year in office, it did so with hardly a vote to spare in both houses.
 But Mr. Clinton is not a leader, though he can sometimes be persuaded that it is in his interest to be an energetic follower. No. Leadership will have to come from the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich.
 Here is Mr. Gingrich's opportunity to transform himself from a successful gadfly into a political heavyweight. It may be necessary for him to bite the bullet and give up his cherished plan for tax cuts, at any rate for the moment, as the Senate has done. In any event, he should take up the challenge and lead the movement to transform America into a model of frugality.
 Certainly the world needs such an example. All over the third world, progress is held back by the unwillingness of governments to balance their books, even under direct pressure from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The ascent of the former Communist world to freedom and prosperity is imperiled by precisely the same vice.
 Even in Europe, which ought to know better, a dozen governments are piling up deficits and debts for fear of voters who in fact are desperate for thrifty leaders. The United States would add immeasurably to the moral debt the world already owes it if Washington could take the lead in bringing us all back to good old-fashioned providence.

BANKRUPTCIES
Implant Mess: What Is Real?
Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy protection last week, swamped by lawsuits over breast implants. But the odd thing about this multibillion-dollar mess is that there is considerable doubt about whether the implants are actually harmful. Scientific doubt, that is. The legal system seems convinced that implants cause a variety of maladies, but a number of scientific studies balk at that -- finding that the diseases are real, but the cause not established. The bankruptcy is real, though, halting all new lawsuits and delaying settlement of existing ones -- for at least two years and probably longer. And the company's owners, Dow Chemical and Corning, will no doubt see their investments go to women's claims.
 
TOBACCO
Smoke, but Fire Next Year
That huge class-action suit against the tobacco companies will have to wait. A big group of lawyers in New Orleans was going full speed ahead in its attempt to show, among other things, that cigarette makers concealed knowledge that nicotine is addictive. And they had plans to notify -- through nationwide ads -- up to 90 million smokers that they were part of the class. But last week the judge allowed an appeal now -- on whether the class should be certified. The bad news for the lawyers is that this means a delay of six months to a year -- just when they had their engines running. But one lawyer saw a silver lining -- that they could get the certification question cleared up now, before spending vast sums on the case.
 
PUBLISHING
Words, Words, Words for Sale
The Encyclopaedia Britannica was first published in 1768, before the existence of the United States -- or, yes, even Microsoft -- and is still going. But not surprisingly -- at a time when many homes have more computers than books -- sales are dropping, from 117,000 sets in 1990 to 51,000 last year. Then again, look at it this way: even in the age of the CD-ROM, fully 51,000 people and libraries shelled out $1,500 for the 32 volumes of this ultimate reference work. But that's not enough, and Britannica is losing money -- and last week its owner, a private trust called the William Benton Foundation, put it up for sale. And as befits the age, the potential buyers included not just publishers like Simon & Schuster but, you guessed it, Microsoft.
 
TRADE WARS
Tyrannosaurus Lexus?
A world without Lexuses (Lexi?) would be a sorry place indeed. Some people would probably have to settle for lapel buttons saying, "I'm so loaded I could spend $50,000 for a mere car." But just such a world loomed as a possibility last week as the Administration, making its move in some convoluted political game, plunked a 100 percent tariff on Japan's luxury cars. It's effective for cars arriving now, but won't be applied till late June -- allowing time for a settlement, or for this saber-rattling to pass. But if it sticks, that'll be it for new Lexuses, Infinitis and the like -- $30,000 to $50,000 is one thing, but $50,000 to $80,000? To the Mercedes dealer, Jeeves. And those of you scooping up "bargain" Lexuses now may find dealers few and far between.
 
BANKING
Musical Bank Chairs
Anyone inclined to brand loyalty must have a hard time when it comes to banks. These days, the "venerable" banks are the ones that haven't changed their name or ownership in, say, five years. Until 1988, Bowery Savings was a New York fixture, but then it was bought by H.F. Ahmanson, its branches turned into Home Savings offices. But then last week Greenpoint bought 60 Home Savings outlets -- mostly old Bowery branches. It paid dearly -- $660 million -- but Greenpoint used to be a mutual savings bank, and after going public it had a lot of money to spend. Now it has spent it -- and old Bowery customers face a new identity crisis.
 
AUTOS
Chrysler Can Spare a Dime
Chrysler tossed Kirk Kerkorian a bone last week, raising its dividend from 40 cents to 50 at its annual meeting -- after saying in December that there would be no increases this year. Not that it was admitting being swayed by Mr. Kerkorian's effort to buy the company, and his push for a far bigger dividend increase. "That was not the dominant issue at all," said Robert Eaton, the chairman. Now, Mr. Eaton said, he simply hoped the "disruptive force" of Mr. Kerkorian's nudging just "goes away." And Chrysler's tough stance seems to have worked, for no other big shareholders rallied to Mr. Kerkorian's cause, apparently a vote of confidence in Chrysler's cautious long-term plan. And the stock has settled at around $42, above the $39 before the bid but well below the $55 Mr. Kerkorian offered.
 
STOCK MARKET
Dow Drops 82; Life Goes On
So why did the Dow industrials plunge 82 points on Thursday, the year's biggest drop? You could trot out the usual suspects -- trade deficits, bond prices, an economy too strong or too weak (pick one). Or you could just look at the numbers: the Dow had risen 750 since November, traders with a fear of heights were glancing warily about to see who'd jump first, and on Thursday some jumped. And remember: 82 points ain't what it used to be. In the days of an 800 Dow, that would have been a scary 10 percent. At today's lofty levels, this drop doesn't even weigh in at 2 percent. So there's a good chance the world is not coming to an end.
 
CONGRESS
Tame the Deficit or Bust
Balancing the budget has become almost a religious crusade for Republicans, with the House last week charging ahead and voting a specific plan to break even by 2002. Specific, that is, except for things like how they'll save $280 billion on Medicare. If the Senate passes its own cuts this week, they'll have to work out the differences -- mainly that $350 billion House tax cut. But then comes a likely veto -- the House vote, 238 to 193, is not veto-proof. . . . Senate budget-cutters, meanwhile, want to do away with taxpayer-financed elections, which were created as a post-Watergate reform, saying Government should stay out of politics. What did the Democrats think? It would create an "obscene race for dollars," said Senator Christopher Dodd.
 
FUGITIVES
How to Steal a Billion
It's hard to steal billions of dollars -- because, well, most people don't leave billions of dollars lying around waiting to be stolen. But a German developer named Jurgen Schneider is accused of doing just that -- a year ago, his vast real estate empire collapsed and he disappeared, leaving $5 billion in debts. And last week -- after continuing reports that put him in places like Switzerland and Iran -- he was arrested in Hollywood, Fla., trying hard to look like your basic retiree. Does he have something stashed away? Who knows. But the real question is, How could German banks have let this happen? They may be asked that more often now that Mr. Schneider's dream vacation is over.
 
HOLLYWOOD
All Eyes on Mr. Ovitz
One thing is certain: Michael Ovitz will continue to call a lot of shots in Hollywood. The only question: where he'll be sitting. There was talk last week that he might leave the Creative Artists Agency, which practically owns Hollywood, to head MCA, which Seagram just bought. But the math gets tricky: Creative Artists could be worth $400 million now, and Mr. Ovitz probably owns half of it, but if he leaves and takes some top agents with him, it'll look a lot less valuable. In short, he's an awfully valuable man, so one wonders whether Seagram -- and its shareholders -- are ready to pay what it will take to get him.

 "More than any other developed country," you write, "Japan has resolved to 'just say no' to crime," and "Japan may offer some lessons about ways to achieve security -- and the price of that safety." You describe how the Japanese police and courts have more extensive powers than those in the United States, how handguns are banned and how prisons are harsh places where inmates are expected to learn to feel remorse for their crimes.
 You give these policies causal significance in Japan's low crime rates, mentioning only as an afterthought the influence of Japan's egalitarian distribution of wealth. You also imply a causal link between rates of crime and rates of single motherhood, as well as a link between crime and the degree of "permissiveness" in American society.
 How does your correspondent know that authoritarian crime policies and a lack of "permissiveness" keep crime rates low? Could it not just as plausibly be that Japan's higher and more equal level of economic opportunity and relatively generous social safety net make people less desperate and make it less likely they will feel so socially alienated as to commit violent crime?
 There is certainly no consensus among sociologists about whether it is the absence of a father or the absence of economic opportunity that leads children of broken families to commit crimes in greater numbers.
We should not be led to expect that changes in the criminal justice system can have an impact on crime while increasing numbers of Americans are impoverished, alienated and desperate, and society offers them little assistance, compassion or hope.

HEADLINE: The Brochures Pile Up. The Decision Presses. The Question: To Join or Not to Join?

BYLINE: By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE 

 BODY:
LOREN KALISH was 24 and frightened.
Burson-Marsteller, the public relations giant on Park Avenue South where she works as an associate, had just announced that all employees had to choose a health-maintenance organization. She knew H.M.O.'s usually require patients to see only doctors in their networks and insist on approving any visit to a specialist. But a "wonderful doctor" at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center had seen her through the ordeal of several irregular Pap smear readings, and she dreaded being treated by anyone else. 
 "I was not about to give him up," she says. "I was afraid I was going to have to pay for him myself!" She didn't have to. Ms. Kalish learned she had an option that would let her see an out-of-network specialist. "That," she says, "was an enormous relief -- my mother died of cancer so I know how important it is to find the best doctor you can." She saves money by using her H.M.O. doctor for routine care but sees her trusted gynecologist occasionally.
For Robert Fasano, a 43-year-old graphic designer who lives on the Upper East Side, the decision about a health-care plan was more traumatic and immediate. In 1990, he underwent a liver transplant at Mt. Sinai Hospital. At the time, he was covered under an insurance plan that let him pick his own doctors and reimbursed him for much of their cost. Last year, while covered under his wife's H.M.O., he started feeling terrible.
"The MetLife network physician, a nice guy who did not know much about post-transplant problems, did not figure out what was wrong," he recalls. "I called a doctor associated with the original transplant team, and in a few minutes on the phone he diagnosed cellulitis, got me to an emergency room and may have saved my life."
These two cases illustrate the often agonizing decisions New Yorkers now face as the nation's medical system -- after more than a decade of skyrocketing costs -- undergoes a fundamental and tortuous transformation.
When it comes time to select a heath-care plan, you will probably find yourself staring, glassy-eyed, at a formidable bundle of folders, each with vast amounts of information about H.M.O.'s, other managed-care plans and traditional fee-for-service insurance. What to do?
* Should you continue to get health care in the traditional manner, by seeing your own independent doctors, paying a fee and filing a claim with an insurance company?
* Or, like much of the rest of the nation, should you switch to managed care and an H.M.O., which promises to provide health care at a much lower cost but without sacrificing quality?
* If you do switch, how can you decide which H.M.O. to join and how to use it to best advantage?
As recently as two years ago, only 10 percent of all city residents were enrolled in an H.M.O., according to the state Department of Health. Today that number has nearly doubled and is rising rapidly. Currently, 12 H.M.O.'s operate in the city.
This shift toward managed care has ignited a furious debate whose main ingredients are money, medical ethics and the quality of treatment. Though there is little dispute that managed-care companies have lowered health-care costs, many in the medical community argue that their determination to do just that has compromised the quality of care. For their part, the companies insist that their care is every bit as good as that provided under fee for service.
Several studies are grappling with these issues, but their answers are a long way away. In announcing one such analysis to be done by the Hudson Center, an independent research group in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation said that while managed-care executives constantly strive to beef up efficiency and pare costs, "they do not yet have a systematic method for assessing the ethical dimensions of their decisions."
The angst surrounding all the point-counterpoint is heightened as more and more local companies apply economic pressure to switch to managed care -- dangling carrots and wielding sticks to keep their own health-insurance costs in check.
An H.M.O., already the dominant form of health care in some parts of the country, is usually a private, for-profit company that hires doctors under contract to treat patients for a set range of fees. Once in an H.M.O., you pick a primary-care doctor -- a "gatekeeper," -- who will do checkups and treat common illnesses. Usually, part of the primary-care doctor's job is to decide if a patient needs a specialist and to pick one in the H.M.O. network. There is normally a small co-payment, from about $2 to $15, for each doctor visit, but no deductible and no paperwork. There can be a catch: a gatekeeper who keeps the gate closed and denies permission to see a specialist. An appeal can be tedious, time-consuming, and sometimes, fruitless.
Most H.M.O.'s also offer what may, for now, be the best of all worlds, a "point-of-service option," which, for more money, allows visits to a specialist outside the network.
Another common, and simpler, form of managed-care company is a preferred-provider organization, or P.P.O., usually a network of doctors who sign up with an insurance company and agree to treat its customers at below-standard rates. It's important to be aware that, even in traditional fee-for-service medicine, there now may be some form of managed care -- someone who watches over a doctor's treatment decisions and fees. It may be a company hired by the insurer, or by your own employer. The goal is the same: to help keep down overall costs.
Medical-care costs are dropping, and economists attribute the reductions in large measure to managed care. The average cost of health benefits for American workers declined last year to $3,741 from $3,781, according to Foster Higgins, a benefits consulting firm. The Federal Labor Department reports that during the same period, health-insurance costs paid by employers dropped by 1 percent after increasing by as much as 18 percent a year during the last decade.
But those economies cut to the heart of the debate. Fee-for-service doctors' basic view is this: the quality of medicine suffers when patient and doctor are forced to give up their mutual trust and the physician's knowledge of a patient's history, built up over the years. Furthermore, they say, when a health-care corporation restricts the treatment a patient may or may not have, it may be putting money before medicine, the interests of its stockholders ahead of its patients.
Dr. Norma M. T. Braun, a pulmonary specialist at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, says she often has to wage time-consuming battles to get managed-care companies to approve needed treatment for her patients.
"There are now 12 to 15 percent annual salary increases for the chief executives of these managed-care companies," Dr. Braun says, "the rationale being that the companies have to stay competitive or they will lose the best executives. But we really have to look at the cost of cost containment -- it's become enormous, and the patient suffers. I'm as much against waste as anyone. But the first obligation in medicine has to be to the patient, not the pocketbook."
Dr. Braun treats patients covered under both fee-for-service plans and several H.M.O.'s that approached her and that she has signed with. Her colleagues call her a brilliant example of the kind of doctor you want under any system; her patients are equally effusive. A prominent Upper West Side musicologist who suffers from asthma, high-blood pressure, several broken ribs and cancer calls Dr. Braun a "one-person H.M.O." because "she does so much herself and then makes so many excellent referrals." But in Dr. Braun's experience, managed care often makes it difficult to practice the best medicine: "You're spending all your time arguing instead of treating your patient."
The H.M.O.'s complain that the doctors present isolated, anecdotal "horror" stories and that there are an equal number of similar upsetting accounts under fee-for-service medicine. As for the argument that patient-doctor relationships will be severed under H.M.O.'s, they insist that many consumers find it easier and receive better care by staying with one doctor, the H.M.O. primary-care physician, than they did when they were switching from one costly specialist to another. They contend, too, that when patients have to pay very little to be treated as often as necessary, the primary-care doctor is more likely to practice successful preventative medicine, like making sure routine checkups and tests are done and health regimens followed.
Leslie Moran, director of communications for the New York State H.M.O. Council, a private trade association, says: "H.M.O.'s are making sure that patients get the appropriate care at all levels. It's in their own best interests to put the consumers' interest first -- we don't want people unhappy or unwell."
The H.M.O.'s also point to their own national surveys, which often show a level of patient satisfaction approaching 90 percent. But it is not always easy to know precisely what is being surveyed. Tod Cooperman, president of CareData Reports, an independent research group, said that while "the plans try to put their best material forward, naturally," the range of satisfaction goes from a high of 70 percent "highly satisfied" to 62 percent "dissatisfied."
Generally, the satisfied patients they are talking about are people like Faye Joyce of the Upper West Side, who has been a member of the Health Insurance Plan (HIP) of Greater New York since 1976 and uses its center at Amsterdam Avenue and 68th Street.
"When my husband had trouble getting over the flu," she says, "HIP did a battery of routine tests, and then their specialists came in. He had a stress test, saw a psychiatrist and a neurologist and it was determined that he had Parkinson's disease -- and they got second and third opinions."
 
SEEING A SPECIALIST CAN BE TRICKY
But the critics of H.M.O.'s and other forms of managed care insist that problems they see are more than isolated cases of bad medicine -- and that they fall into four main areas: failure to refer patients to proper specialists, emergency decisions, premature hospital discharges and inadequate mental-health care.
The specialist problem is reflected in the case of a 40-year-old woman who suffers from a rare blood-clotting disorder that caused her to suffer strokes and, in turn, almost uncontrollable epileptic seizures. Dr. Orrin Devinsky, director of the New York University/Hospital for Joint Diseases Epilepsy Center, at 17th Street and Second Avenue, was called in on the case by Dr. James A. Charles, a neurologist.
Dr. Charles, a consultant to the woman's primary-care physician in H.M.O.-Blue of New Jersey, requested that she be transferred to Dr. Devinsky's care.
"I received a phone call from an H.M.O.-Blue nurse," Dr. Charles recalled. "She said she had never heard of the disease and directed me to the physicians' supervisor. He told me he was looking to cut costs, and that the patient could be treated in New Jersey. He berated me, saying he had heard stories before from other physicians who want to transfer patients to New York or Philadelphia or Boston for more expensive treatment out of network."
The transfer was denied, Dr. Charles said, but "this story had a happy ending: Her husband's insurance company authorized the transfer; she was treated in New York and is now doing well."
H.M.O.-Blue of New Jersey said it would not comment on the case out of respect for patient confidentiality. The new president of Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield in New York, Dr. Michael Stocker, points out that Blue Cross in New York is operated separately from New Jersey but added, "It is utterly obvious that this woman should have been transferred." And spokesmen for the H.M.O. industry say its doctors are as eager as anyone to have a top-notch specialist treat a complicated case when necessary.
Nevertheless, Dr. Devinsky maintains, "The H.M.O.'s do vary with regard to the ease with which a patient can be referred out of network. And some restrict the criteria for use of important tests or procedures."
He tells the story of one of his patients, a Manhattan man who had been treated for epilepsy for 43 years by some of the nation's leading neurologists. "We found out doing a diagnostic video-EEG during one of the patient's seizures that he didn't have epilepsy at all," Dr. Devinsky said, "but rather cardiac arrhythmia that slowed blood flow to the brain -- and had been treated for the wrong thing all that time."
Had the patient been in an H.M.O., it is unlikely the video-EEG (video-electroencephalogram) test would have been approved, he said. "You can only use an in-patient video-EEG for surgery, for example, to locate where in the brain a patient's seizures come from. But not for general diagnosis." Since the correct diagnosis was made, Dr. Devinsky said, the patient "has a Pacemaker and has been seizure-free for three years."
Some doctors who work for H.M.O.'s in the city say the companies have told them to transfer patients from non-network hospitals to network hospitals, even though the patients were too sick to be moved. Similarly, they tell of being discouraged from moving critically ill patients into intensive-care units at non-network hospitals, even when there are no ICU beds at network hospitals. Others complain about pressure to discharge mothers and their newborn babies even though another child or someone else may be sick at home. The doctors were unwilling to speak for attribution, saying they feared having their H.M.O. contracts canceled.
Kathryn Allen, president of the New York State H.M.O. Council, denied that H.M.O.'s pressure doctors to take any steps that would put patients at risk. "To do so would be self-defeating," she said.
Some H.M.O. doctors say colleagues fear their contracts may not be renewed if they disagree too often or too vigorously with the administrators of their plans. But an Upper East Side dermatologist who belongs to several H.M.O.'s said an effective way to resolve a battle is to "simply send an overnight certified letter, return-receipt requested, to management, stating the urgency of the treatment you demand -- and you send a copy to the patient!"
The last main area of debate is mental health. Psychiatrists in the city complain that H.M.O.'s offer little or no managed care for patients with serious long-term conditions -- clinical depression and anxiety, bipolarism and schizophrenia. Some plans, they say, do not have enough psychiatrists or child psychiatrists.
"There is the fear in general that mental-health coverage leads you to a black hole of unending costs," says Dr. John C. Markowitz, an attending psychiatrist at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Cornell University Medical College. "But studies show that this isn't so -- failure to treat mental health properly is in the long run much more costly in lost productivity and future illnesses than almost all other forms of sickness."
Dr. Markowitz cited a case of what he called badly managed managed care, in which a 17-year-old patient developed manic depression, became delusional and thought himself the Messiah. The managed-care company, which the doctor declined to name, wanted the boy released from the hospital before Dr. Markowitz thought he was ready. When the company told his parents it would no longer pay for their son's hospitalization, they agreed to his discharge. "The boy was back in another hospital in two weeks," Dr. Markowitz said.
Psychiatrists also complain of a tendency of some primary-care doctors to treat psychiatric problems themselves. Often they prescribe the antidepressant Prozac, thinking there are no side effects; true in most cases, but not all. Or, they say, a medical doctor may believe incorrectly that he or she can detect a chronic schizophrenic who has stopped taking medication.
Many employers now use "carve-out" companies to manage mental-health care, and critics contend their real intent is to limit such care. Workers are often required to get approval from such companies or from the employer's own employee-assistance program before they will pay for any psychiatric help.
But Aetna, which operates both a carve-out division and H.M.O.'s that provide mental-health care, insists that the care given by both is equal in quality to that of individual psychiatrists. "To do otherwise," Dr. Jack Montgomery, an Aetna vice president, said, "would be penny-wise and pound-foolish." And Dr. Leonard Reich, the New York vice president for mental-health services at HIP, said it, too, provides high-quality mental-health care under its plans' basic provisions. He added, however, that employers looking to cut costs often cut mental health coverage first.
 
SOME SAY ALL H.M.O.'S ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL
Where does all this back-and-forth leave the New Yorker who, for economic or whatever reason, is going the H.M.O. route and trying to figure out which company and plan best suits his or her needs?
One of the fastest-growing H.M.O.'s in the city is Oxford. Its managers contend that one reason is its emphasis on point of service, the option that allows patients to go out of network. David Snow, Oxford's executive vice president, said another reason is that Oxford has "always treated our physicians as partners," allowing them far more autonomy than many H.M.O.'s.
Both Oxford's basic plan and its point-of-service plan finished at the top of a survey of overall patient satisfaction with H.M.O.'s in the city, as well as on Long Island and in Westchester, Rockland, Putnam and Orange counties. The survey, by CareData of New York, the independent research firm, questioned 3,397 metropolitan area residents.
Another H.M.O. available in the city, ChoiceCare, finished first in four of the survey's sub-categories: satisfaction with primary-care physicians, administration, choice of hospitals and choice of pharmacies.
And then there is an H.M.O. being set up in the city by First Option, which was founded last July by doctors and hospitals in New Jersey. Echoing those who contend that bottom-line considerations outweigh medical ones under some managed-care companies, First Option's president, John Odessa, says: "What makes us different is that we have no shareholders requiring 20 to 25 percent profit margins. Our primary incentive is to provide optimal health care."
First Option is a for-profit corporation owned by doctors and hospitals who are stockholders. But its board has voted to limit its profit margin to 5 percent.

Charts: "EXIT SIGNS: Going Out of Network"
Basic H.M.O. plans do not allow you to see out-of-network doctors. But most offer options that do, called point-of-service (P.O.S.) plans. Monthly premiums for such plans range from 10% to 20% higher than for basic H.M.O. membership, but other payments stay the same unless a consumer sees an out-of-network doctor. Many consumers, therefore, use their primary-care H.M.O. doctor for routine check-ups and leave the network only to visit a specialist. When they do, it triggers deductibles, reimbursement and out-of-pocket expense limits - the total amount a comsumer has to pay in a year. Most companies offer several point-of-service plans. These are some.; "Vital Signs" list figures for 10 major H.M.O.'s in the city (Source: Individual companies; New York State Department of Insurance); "Dollar Signs" lists first visit and follow-up visit costs for seeing a specialist in 7 major H.M.O.'s (Source: Dr. Richard Lester) (pg. 13)

HEADLINE: The Lowcountry Of South Carolina

BYLINE: By GUY GARCIA; GUY GARCIA is a frequent visitor to South Carolina's
Lowcountry.

 BODY:
STEEPED in history and studded with some of the most elegant examples of American Colonial architecture, the great plantations of South Carolina have long been a mecca for anyone seeking the quintessence of gracious hospitality. But the stately houses and exquisite gardens of antebellum landmarks like Middleton Place, Drayton Hall and Magnolia Gardens are only part of the story. For a fuller taste of pre-Civil War life, a visitor can also experience the rice fields, swamps and meandering rivers that were once the economic engines of the Lowcountry estates, connecting the landed families of the region with each other and the outside world.
 Until recently, exploring the waterways and hinterlands of South Carolina's sprawling plantations was either unwieldly or impossible. But that has changed with the advent of two popular advances in recreational technology -- the kayak and the all-terrain mountain bike. Together they offer an opportunity to see the Colonial South from an off-road perspective that emphasizes the hidden history and natural beauty of the region. 
Intrigued by the notion of an eco-sensitive tour of Middleton Place plantation, my wife, Cathleen, and I signed up with W3 Outfitters (for Water, Woods and Wildlife), a Charleston-based company that runs ecological mountain bike and kayak tours through Middleton's 6,500 acres of rivers, rice fields, swamps and forest. We joined a group kayaking trip down the Ashley River on the first afternoon; the second day I set out with a single guide for a mountain bike and swamp tour. W3 operates by reservation only; the trips begin and end at the Middleton Inn, a 55-room hotel where we booked a room, though accommodations at the inn are not included in any W3 package.
 Opened to the public in 1986, the inn is a sleekly modern assembly of two-story and three-story buildings made of wood, glass and concrete that sits next to Middleton's noted formal gardens. The geometrical open spaces in the main building frame the surrounding foliage and echo the ruins of the main house of the estate, which was burned by Sherman's troops in 1865. Our room was a spacious studio on the second floor, with a fireplace, cypress-paneled walls, oak floors and furniture upholstered in shades of vanilla. Floor to ceiling windows, outfitted with double rows of pine shutters, afforded a view of the wooded footpath that follows the Ashley River to Middleton Place.
 We spent the morning of our first day strolling through the grounds, one of the oldest formal gardens in the United States. Planted in 1741 under the direction of Henry Middleton, the first president of the Continental Congress, the gardens fell into neglect after the great earthquake of 1886, but were restored and enhanced in the early 20th century. Designed to take advantage of Middleton's sloped river-bank site, they are a labyrinth of angular pathways, reflecting ponds and stepped lawns.
 During a picnic lunch by the pool at the inn, we met with Ben Chapman, the proprietor of W3 Outfitters, and the rest of our party, which included a magazine publisher, a real estate appraiser, a lawyer and the Charleston-based watercolorist Rhett Thurman. A strapping, energetic man with a neatly cropped beard, Mr. Chapman, who is a former board member of the South Carolina chapter of the national Nature Conservancy, founded W3 in 1993 as a venture dedicated to "historical, nature-based experiences." His affinity for the lore and land of the Lowcountry was immediately apparent as he began pointing out how the inn itself was built on the site of a century-old phosphate processing plant. "See those trees right there?" he asked, pointing to a pair of long-stemmed saplings growing near the pool. "Those are Chinese parasol trees. They aren't indigenous -- the seeds were blown in from the Caribbean during Hurricane Hugo. Aren't they pretty?"
 Mr. Chapman then strode over to the lawn, where a half-dozen 16-foot plastic and glass fiber sea kayaks were in a neat row. Sitting in the hull of one he demonstrated the proper way to get in and out, how to paddle ("The principle of paddling is based on leverage not muscle") and what to do if the kayaker should tip over ("Relax, hold on to your paddle and get out of the boat"). Thus prepared, we shoved off into the tannin-tinted water of the Ashley and began paddling north, past Middleton's jade lawns and butterfly lakes, all the while doing our best to navigate the wake from an occasional passing speedboat. The recreational craft that buzz up and down the river are a particular peeve of Mr. Chapman, who grimly pointed out erosion of the bank caused by their wakes. The river ranges from 30 to several hundred feet wide at the landing at Middleton.
 We kept paddling away from the plantation until all we could hear was the sound of the wind whipping through the gold-green curtain of spartina grass sprouting from the banks. Along the water line, armies of fiddler crabs scurried over the rocks as egrets and osprey wheeled in the limpid sky. Now and again we came upon a lone fisherman, his pole raised over the glistening water. These wetlands, Mr. Chapman told us, are home to bald eagles, loggerhead turtles, wood storks, alligators and dozens of other rare or endangered species. On the way back, paddling against the current, we kept a lookout for the 16-foot-long alligator that Mr. Chapman had spotted a few days earlier. At the end of our two-hour excursion, as we turned the final bend, the sun was slanting through the branches of Middleton's giant river oaks and for a moment the plantation seemed restored to the grandeur of its 18th-century self.
 LATER that evening, Mr. Chapman offered to drive us to a rice pond about a half-mile from the inn to watch the sunset. Sitting in a wooden duck blind that he built himself ("The only kind of shooting that goes on here is with a camera," he told us), we sipped wine and watched as the sky ignited in neonshades of salmon and magenta. When the sun dipped behind the treeline, the earth seemed to hold its breath for moments before exploding into a nocturnal fugue of croaking marsh frogs.
 Next morning, as first light touched the treetops, we watched from our bed as a redheaded woodpecker cavorted in the branches outside our room. The pale blanket of fog that had covered the Ashley overnight burned off by the time we walked to the lodge for a breakfast of omelets, muffins, cereal and fresh juices. Mr. Chapman soon arrived with a pair of 22-speed Univega Rover mountain bikes for our five-hour bike tour. He led the way as we cycled past the riding stables and across highway 61, where 50 miles of dirt paths and utility roads crisscross the property, which takes up the better part of Dorchester County.
 We rode single file past flowering dogwood trees and groves of 200-year-old longleaf pine, pausing frequently as Mr. Chapman identified botanical and historic points of interest. Breaking on a sandy rise, Mr. Chapman scrutinized the foliage. "There's a lot going on here," he announced, plucking off a leaf of southern bay and crushing it between his fingers. "Smell that," he said. "That's pungent, I use it for cooking all the time." Taking a few steps, he leaned over and snapped off a branch of Lowcountry cane, stripping away the thin brown bark to reveal the bamboo stem underneath. Taking out his pocketknife, Mr. Chapman split the bark and bent it into a small hoop. "The Indians used this to make baskets," he noted.
 We had biked several more miles when the road dipped and the terrain became lusher. We were getting closer to the swamp. Along the way, we stopped to admire a solitary atamasco lily growing in the center of the road beside the green fan of a scrub palmetto. A few minutes later we arrived at an old swamp dike that had survived for at least 200 years. The land to our left, once used to grow corn, indigo and other cash crops, was dry and overgrown with brush; on the right was a rice field that had reverted to swamp.
 The tangled foliage of the swamp was alive with the cacophonous music of warblers, crows and woodpeckers. Mr. Chapman bent over to show me an otter slide on the edge of a drainage canal. Then, in a voice that made me stiffen, he told me to "Turn around, very slowly." I did as he said and immediately spotted an alligator about 10 feet away, drifting toward us. The alligator was a juvenile about four feet long, but I nevertheless felt a visceral tingle of apprehension. As we strolled along the dike, the animal followed, watching us with open curiosity. Before we left, I scanned the still surface of the water, hoping to see it again, but our amphibious friend was too perfectly camouflaged in his natural habitat.
 From the dike it was a short ride to the wooden shed where Mr. Chapman had stored several plastic swamp kayaks. Sliding the boats into the indigo water, we pushed off from the bank for about a 90-minute trip and entered a primordial world of giant bull rushes, floating creepers and stalagmite-like root formations -- all reflected in the swamp's still surface, which duplicated and magnified the foliage like a fun house mirror. Producing bags of Cajun-style boiled peanuts, a local delicacy, Mr. Chapman handed me some and munched a few himself. Then he dipped a plastic bottle under the carpet of floating leaves and lifted it out full. The water was clear with a reddish tint, like weak iced tea. "Go ahead and take a drink," Mr. Chapman said. "It's pure rainwater. Delicious." After a moment's hesitation, I did. It tasted like iced tea, too.
 We paddled deeper into the swamp, listening to the staccato banter of a dozen different birds. Sunlight filtered through the growing emerald canopy and, bent by the ripples from our boats, made luminous bands that undulated over mammoth cypress trunks. The effect was enchanting, like being inside an aquarium. "This is the place that, once I bring people in here, I have to drag them out because they don't ever want to leave," Mr. Chapman remarked. As I drifted farther into the leafy cavern of pulsating light and color, I had no trouble understanding why.

THE TYRANNY OF NUMBERS
Mismeasurement and Misrule.
By Nicholas Eberstadt.
305 pp. Washington:
The AEI Press. Cloth, $24.95. Paper, $16.95. 
THE modern liberal democracy is an edifice built on numbers. Rationalist, problem-solving and expansive in nature, it strives to better the lot of its citizens by charting policy against statistics. In the process, however, it inevitably transgresses the limits of knowledge. The result: misrule born of mismeasurement.
So goes Nicholas Eberstadt's line of argument in "The Tyranny of Numbers." One might expect him to support it by looking at the states that have ventured farthest in the rationalist, "meliorative" direction he thinks is so perilous: France and Germany, say, where government spending accounts for roughly half the national output, or the even more socialized Scandinavian countries, where the figure is almost two-thirds.
But while Mr. Eberstadt, a visiting scholar at the somewhat right-of-center American Enterprise Institute and a visiting fellow of the Harvard University Center for Population and Development Studies, has profitable observations to make about the world food problem, poverty in South Africa and literacy under Communism, the only liberal democracy he directly considers is the United States. That is odd. Our public sector, after all, is relatively small. As a nation we tend to agree with Ronald Reagan that "government is the problem." So by the author's lights we should be better off than our counterparts in the more meddlesome European welfare states.
Why, then, is our poverty level so stubbornly high? Why is our rate of infant mortality an international disgrace? Mr. Eberstadt has a ready answer. These are but statistical illusions, he argues -- another manifestation of the tyranny of numbers.
Take infant mortality, a key index of national well-being. Our rate may be one of the worst among the industrialized nations, Mr. Eberstadt concedes, but "U.S. babies at any given birth weight appear to have unusually good chances of surviving the perinatal period, regardless of race." The real problem is our tendency to produce babies with low birth weights -- a tendency that according to the author's painstaking analysis is associated not so much with poverty or lack of access to health care as it is with parental negligence during the prenatal period.
Mr. Eberstadt may not be right to blame low birth weight for American infant mortality; the latest study indicates that being born too soon rather than too small is the main cause of infant death. (For a given length of pregnancy, lighter babies are as likely to survive as heavier ones.) Yet his logic gives rise to deeper misgivings. When it suits him, he will explain away bad numbers by pointing to individual choices that the state cannot do much about. Thus infant mortality in the United States, far from being Washington's fault for failing to provide funds for better prenatal care, is a result of Americans -- single mothers in particular -- freely exercising "the right to be a negligent parent." In other cases, however, the system seems to be guilty. The collapse of health standards in the former Soviet bloc, for instance, is a black mark against Communism, even though (as Mr. Eberstadt shows) it was in large part brought on by the prodigious consumption of hard liquor and cigarettes.
Oddly, the farther Mr. Eberstadt strays from his philosophical premise, the better his book gets. His diagnosis of why the C.I.A. blundered so badly in estimating the size of the Soviet economy is superb. Even better is his careful demographic debunking of the myth, propagated by Unicef among others, that the third-world debt crisis is killing millions of children.
No doubt policy by statistics -- plagued as it is by false precision, biased indexes and sheer invention of numbers -- has resulted in a great deal of governmental mischief, not to say tyranny. Yet Mr. Eberstadt's suggestion that the United States is already bumping up against the "immutable limits" of state knowledge, and hence perfectibility, strikes me as unduly cautious. It should not be forgotten that there are some nations today, no richer or cleverer than ours, where you can't tell the economic class of a child by looking at his teeth.

HEADLINE: County Advertises Its Economic Vitality

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
AMID signs that the national and state economies are slowing down, the message on a cable television channel in the county was clear: Westchester is growing and the business outlook remains robust. In an advertising campaign on television and radio, individual executives representing a spectrum of business in the county, said that despite darkening clouds elsewhere, the picture was bright where they work.
Nationally, leading indicators fell 0.5 of 1 percent in March, their biggest decline in two years and the first consecutive decline in nearly three years, the United States Commerce Department reported this month. But in Westchester, indicators were up -- unemployment was low and is inching down and companies reported healthy profits -- according to economists and the Westchester Business Partnership, the public-private-sector coalition that sponsored the ads. 
 Take the story of Eileen Fisher, which the Business Partnership said represents the kind of growth many Westchester companies are experiencing. The fashion designer moved her business from Manhattan to a converted warehouse on the Hudson River in Irvington three years ago and reported that profits more than doubled to $2.7 million from $1.1 million in the first year.
In a 30-second television spot, Ms. Fisher talks earnestly about the reasonable cost of doing business in Westchester and the relatively lower taxes and rents that her business pays.
George R. Steiner, a co-owner of Steiner Foods, has also taken to the airwaves to tout Westchester's virtues. His family-owned company, which imports and distributes gourmet foods, is about to move from the Bronx to New Rochelle.
The concern, started 65 years ago by Mr. Steiner's grandfather, has been growing at a rate of 10 to 15 percent a year, and Mr. Steiner said Westchester and New Rochelle officials "reached out to us" with tax abatements and other incentives to persuade them to relocate. The company sells to department stores and speciality shops like Zabar's and Balducci's.
The experiences of Ms. Fisher and Mr. Steiner reflect what the Business Partnership calls the changing face of business in the county: the robust growth of smaller and medium-size firms, as opposed to the large corporations that dominated the economic landscape of the 1980's.
The two business owners' experiences also echo what bank officials are reporting for many companies here: healthier inventories, steady growth and sensible acquisitions -- all of which place many mid-size companies in a strong position to expand domestically and in international markets.
Meanwhile, the State Department of Labor is reporting that while job numbers are down statewide, they continue to increase in Westchester: 370,700 jobs in the county in March, up from 366,600 a year ago. The new jobs are mainly in the services sector, construction and retailing.
In explaining the county's current business outlook, economists point to what they consider one of the healthiest byproducts of the changing business scene. Because Westchester is no longer dominated by Fortune 500 corporations, the economists explained, it is less vulnerable to large-scale layoffs that leave many white-collar workers without jobs.
In other words, "diversification of the local economy allows it to withstand periodic setbacks and still rebound," said Richard D. Schaab, vice president of the Westchester County Association, a 600-member business organization.
While the overall picture is promising, all sectors of the economy are not benefiting, and the commercial office vacancy rate for the county remained high -- about 24.9 percent for the first quarter of the year, compared with 22.3 percent at the end of last year. In White Plains, the central business district of the county, the vacancy rate for commercial office space was 30.8 percent, the same as three months ago.
Typically, newer businesses moving to Westchester are renting small spaces, said William V. Cuddy Jr., a senior vice president with the Rostenberg Doern Company, a corporate real estate firm in Purchase and Stamford. Nearly 75 percent of commercial office leases in recent months have been for fewer than 10,000 square feet, he said.
The Eileen Fisher headquarters in Irvington occupies about 28,000 square feet and employs 75 workers. And when Steiner Foods moves to New Rochelle, it will occupy 50,000 square feet -- double its current capacity -- and have 50 employees.
"Years ago in Westchester's golden age of a Texaco or Pepsico, we saw the big multinational companies with thousands of employees and thousands of square feet of office space," said Geoffrey S. Thompson, a partner in Thompson & Bender, an advertising and public relations agency. "That's just not typical of the market anymore. Even the big companies are operating leaner."
At Chemical Bank in White Plains, Robert H. Rogers, regional manager, said the small and medium-size firms seeking loans were in a much stronger position this quarter, with "a healthy cash flow and a strong market presence." Many, he said, were looking at strategic acquisitions.
"There is a real sense among the people we do business with that they are happier now than they were two years ago," Mr. Rogers said of the bank's commercial customers. "The economy was down then, sales were flat, and they didn't see an opportunity for growth.
"In a sense, they are just starting to edge out of the recession, when the rest of the nation has been well out for some time now." He added that most firms were still in a cautious mode -- not overstocking inventories or overextending on receivables to try to minimize the impact of a future downturn.
The county may have been behind the rest of the state by about a year in pulling out of the recession, but it is now expanding at twice the rate -- particularly in terms of job numbers -- said Frank M. Surdey, a regional economist with the State Department of Labor.
He said the unemployment rate in the county in March was 4.7 percent, the lowest March jobless figure since 1990, when it was 3.3 percent. The unemployment rate for the state in March was 6.8 percent, and in the nation it was 5.7 percent. The national rate inched upward to 5.8 percent in April, the highest rate in seven months.
March jobless figures in Westchester were the sixth lowest in the state, behind Putnam, Nassau, Monroe, Albany and Tompkins Counties.
The unemployment rate for New York City in March was 8.5 percent, which represented 30,000 jobs lost as a result of government downsizing, Mr. Surdey said.
Government downsizing in Westchester is also expected to result in job losses, Mr. Surdey said, but most recently, the county government payroll was up by 1 percent to 58,500 jobs.
In general, continued job growth is expected. The March opening of The Westchester mall in White Plains generated 2,500 new jobs, and more stores are expected to open there this summer. In Yonkers, Kawasaki Rail Car, which two years ago feared that it might have to close its plant, recently announced that it had signed a $180 million contract with the Long Island Rail Road to build 114 double-decker cars and a $81 million contract with the Maryland Department of Transportation to manufacture 50 standard cars.
In assessing the economic health of the county, economists like Mr. Surdey also pointed to Mastercard International's pending relocation to Purchase -- a move that will bring 450 jobs to the county -- and to the 85 other companies that have moved to Westchester in the last year.
But the impact of layoffs from previous years continues, and the county reported on May 11 that the United States Department of Labor would provide $819,000 through the Job Training Partnership Act to re-train 300 workers who had recently been laid off. The layoffs occurred at Hudson Wire in Ossining, Controlex-Incom in Croton Falls, the Reader's Digest Association in Pleasantville and A.T.&T. offices in Peekskill.
Also, Mr. Surdey said there were "more dark clouds on the horizon." General Motors is scheduled next year to close its assembly plant in North Tarrytown, where 2,000 workers are employed.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Can a Visit to the Company Doc Help a Cold but Hurt a Career?

BYLINE: By DEBORAH L. JACOBS 

 BODY:
LOW-COST, quality health care, conveniently located. If it sounds too good to be true, it sometimes is -- at least when the boss is wearing the stethoscope.
More employees are going to the company doctor than ever before, and not only because they must have a pre-employment physical or be examined for a workers' compensation claim. Many are now taking advantage of company "wellness programs" stressing preventive care, including periodic screening for heart disease and breast cancer. And employees at a small but growing number of companies are choosing to get all their basic care at what amount to company-run health maintenance organizations. 
 Both the companies and the employees see these services as a way to save money and time, and many workers swear by the good care they receive.
But going to the company doc is sometimes not a good move, either for the health of the employee or the employee's career.
Problems can arise, for example, when tests "disclose an illness that's expensive to cure," said Lewis L. Maltby, director of the national task force on civil liberties in the workplace at the American Civil Liberties Union. You could "lose your coverage or, even worse, your job" if management finds out you have a costly ailment, Mr. Maltby said. "It's not just a privacy issue. It's also an issue of economic security."
Indeed, as company doctors become involved in highly private and medically complex matters, one result is a tangled web of legal and ethical questions:
To whom does the doctor owe loyalty -- the company or the employee? In particular, whose interest does the doctor represent when dealing with an illness or injury caused or worsened by conditions at work? Or one that might have an impact down the line on the employee's performance and health care costs? And are there pressures on the doctor to tailor treatment to the employer's needs, rather than the employee's?
Many company doctors say they get a signal from management -- directly or indirectly -- not to speak up about work conditions that could hurt employees' health, like exposure to toxic chemicals and other risks, said Elaine Draper, a sociology professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. She is working on a book about the problems such doctors face.
Related to those questions are privacy concerns. Companies have taken steps to protect confidentiality, by creating separate files for medical records, developing privacy rules and hiring outside vendors to run their primary-care clinics. Nonetheless, breaches occur.
Stephanie Evans, director of health care advocacy at the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York, said she handled a number of cases in the last year in which employees found out from a company doctor that they were H.I.V. positive and experienced workplace problems as a result.
In one case, at a pharmaceutical company, people in the medical department apparently overheard conversations about a manager's condition and told his co-workers. In another, involving a manager at a large cosmetics company, the information somehow got back to a supervisor, who pressured the manager to leave on disability, Ms. Evans said.
For all these reasons, many health and privacy experts say, employees have to think hard about when to take advantage of the affordable care that companies offer.
Company medical departments, like any other medical service, also face varying perceptions about quality. When Gary Towler, an auto worker at a Ford Motor Company plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., needed a doctor's certification last year to go on disability for a work-related wrist injury, his saw his own doctor instead of the company's.
"The medical service is not highly thought of" at his plant, he said. "It's there, but it's a last resort really."
Mr. Towler also said the company doctor's hours were not convenient for him because he works the night shift and there is no doctor at the plant from midnight until 6 A.M.
Jon Harmon, a Ford spokesman, said company doctors were intended for a limited purpose: to treat only conditions that occur on the job. All other types of injuries and illnesses should be handled by an employee's own doctor, he said. Jennifer Flake, a spokeswoman for Ford, said, "We're proud of the quality of service provided by our physicians companywide."
Many satisfied employees also defend their companies' medical departments. Linda Cowart, a personnel assistant at the Union Camp Corporation in Savannah, Ga., credits a company doctor with saving her life. For more than a year, Ms. Cowart had been to various private physicians complaining of vertigo. One doctor said that it was inner ear trouble, another that she had fluid in her sinuses. Late last year, a Union Camp doctor sent Ms. Cowart for a brain scan that showed she had a benign tumor. She had it removed three days later and has since made a complete recovery.
WHATEVER employees think of the quality of their companies' care, another important issue is confidentiality. Alan F. Westin, publisher of Privacy and American Business, a quarterly newsletter, said employees should be aware of the economic relationship between the doctor and the company. "Anybody who uses a company physician in the assumption that person can be as absolutely respectful of confidentiality as an outside person is foolish," he said.
A crazy quilt of Federal, state and court-made rules governs confidentiality, said Craig M. Cornish, a privacy lawyer in Colorado Springs. Medical ethics rules say doctors may tell management only whether a person is fit to work, and may not disclose diagnoses or other details. Some states have adopted the physician-patient privilege, so that doctors usually cannot divulge anything learned in an examination without first getting a waiver from the patient -- as they might, for example, for pre-employment physicals and workers' compensation exams. At the opposite extreme are state court decisions finding that when the company requires an exam by its own doctor, there is no physician-patient privilege.
Companies can calm employee nerves by clarifying policies and procedures, said Mr. Westin, who advises businesses about privacy issues. That way, he said, employees won't "view the doctor as a company espionage agent." He added that current technology enabled businesses to use bulletproof security systems that keep medical records separate from personnel files.
But even with such safeguards, medical records in the aggregate "may come back to haunt you," said Mark A. Rothstein, professor of law and director of the Health Law and Policy Institute at the University of Houston. Benefits departments that administer or oversee company medical plans sometimes have access to data that show -- without disclosing names -- how many employees and dependents have submitted claims related to AIDS, for example, and what the treatment costs.
Although the law is unclear about what companies can do with that information, they seem to have some latitude to cut coverage "even if it's not good policy or good ethics," Mr. Rothstein said.
Special pressures may come to bear on company doctors that can affect the care of employees in other ways.
With low-back injury, for example, a private doctor might recommend that the employee avoid much bending or lifting at work, said Stephen Levin, medical director of the Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. Yet a company doctor who makes the same recommendation risks interfering with productivity, Dr. Levin said, speaking hypothetically.
Dr. Levin also speaks from experience. Early in his own career, when he ran the employee health service for another hospital, the personnel office asked whether he could come up with a medical reason to find that an employee with high blood pressure could no longer do her job. He refused, and left the position for other reasons a year later.
Nor do cases like this seem to involve only a few companies. Economic tension with management is a pervasive problem for company doctors, said Ms. Draper, the sociology professor.
For her book, Ms. Draper interviewed more than 60 company doctors. Many of them told her anonymously about pressure to violate privacy protocols as well as to keep quiet about risks to the health of workers.
More than a dozen recent lawsuits against E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company and its doctors raise that issue. The suits, filed in New Jersey state court by 68 current and former employees, include accusations that Du Pont doctors discovered toxic levels of lead in the bodies of some employees and did not tell them about it. Du Pont denied the accusations but settled the cases in March of this year. Silvio J. DeCarli, a company lawyer, said details of the settlement were confidential.
Doctors at many companies deny that they face such conflicts. A physician's loyalty belongs to patients, said Robert Kessler, medical director at Quad Graphics, a printing company in Pewaukee, Wis., that runs a full-service medical department for employees and their families.
Since the company opened its clinic five years ago, it has not found any link between printing compounds and employee health problems, Dr. Kessler said, but if it did, the doctors "have the full support from our C.E.O." to put the patient first.
Nobody knows just how many companies have full-service medical departments, but more than two dozen opened clinics in the last several years as they became fed up with other health care options, said Jim Norton, a consultant in Toronto with the Wyatt Company, a benefits firm.
At least one big company has gone in the opposite direction. Southern California Edison, a 50-year leader in company-operated health care, has lately seen no reason to compete with the burgeoning health care business in its region, said Margaret Jordan, vice president for health care and employee services. For the last two years, the utility has been dismantling its clinic, Ms. Jordan said.
But numerous others -- among them Deere & Company, Gillette and Adolph Coors -- see the clinics as tools for reducing the cost of health care benefits, even though the savings are sometimes hard to measure. Employee participation is usually voluntary, but many companies make it substantially less expensive for workers to get health care at their own clinics than elsewhere.
At Union Camp, the forest products company based in Wayne, N.J., each clinic visit costs the employee $15, including lab work and injections. Employees who instead see their own doctors must pay 20 percent of all costs out of their own pockets.
Economics was the initial reason why Dianne Lawhorne, a technician in industrial relations at the company, started taking her daughter, Dru, 2, to the clinic in Savannah. By seeing the family practitioner there, Ms. Lawhorne figures that she saves about $25 a visit, compared with what she paid a private pediatrician. Now, she says she also goes for the good care. The clinic is operated by Medicenter Inc. of Lawton, Okla., which provides the five doctors.
AN emphasis on preventive care also attracts employees to their companies' medical departments. Kathleen M. Davis, 46, a trademark specialist and corporate ethics coordinator for Hercules Inc., a specialty chemicals company in Wilmington, Del., receives a free annual physical from its medical unit and consults it for minor ailments. Several years ago, she said, it played a larger role.
"I had a pounding in my head, in my ear area, and I went to the medical department," she said. "They talked with me, checked me out, and recommended that I see a specialist who diagnosed the symptoms as the beginning of Meniere's disease." She said she is no longer under care for the disease, which is an inner ear disorder. "As far as I'm concerned, I'm fine now," she said.
Gillette, which started its medical department 35 years ago, remains firmly committed to providing employee care, said William Greer, who has been the medical director since the department's inception. He estimates that Gillette saves $75,000 a year just by doing electrocardiograms itself.
Harder to quantify are the savings associated with prevention, one of the chief advantages companies cite for playing an active role in primary care. At Gillette, that includes periodic screening for high blood pressure and diabetes. A wellness program at Coors offers free pap smears and skin cancer checks.
But these are just the type of services that trouble the privacy experts, especially given the somewhat uncertain state of the law.
The Americans With Disabilities Act, in effect for three years, may offer some protections against an employer that uses medical information improperly to affect a worker's job status, said Mr. Cornish, the privacy lawyer in Colorado Springs. But the precise contours of the law, which covers all aspects of the work relationship, remain largely untested.
What's more, bringing a lawsuit is difficult and expensive and "compounds the injury," said Mr. Maltby of the A.C.L.U. "Everyone from the judge to the court clerk knows about your medical history."

HEADLINE: To Keep Russia Out of the Arms Business

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Probably most of us in the United States are happy that Russia has agreed not to sell a gas centrifuge to Iran. Most of us wish that Russia would not sell weapons and the means to create nuclear bombs. 
 Because of past political decisions to support United Nations sanctions against countries such as Iran and Libya, Russia estimates that it has lost 20 percent of its total military-industrial complex hard-currency revenues.
If we do not want Russia to sell what it is most expert at producing -- weapons -- we must work to bring those producers of goods into the free world economy on a fair basis.
On a recent trip to Tula, Russia, a city of 600,000 whose economy was 80 percent dependent upon the manufacture of military equipment and armaments, I toured a factory that has converted 80 percent to peacetime production.
The factory has exported to German companies, which have found some of this factory's technical products to be equal to or superior to their own at half the price. The Germans import the goods, put on their own labels and sell them.
In contrast, more than one American company has made contact with this factory, signed letters of intent, taken samples and plans but, according to the plant director, never followed through. The director believes that these companies only wanted samples and plans to secure their own competitive advantage.
If we are to prevent the cynical re-entry of this factory and many others into the armaments markets to provide jobs and food for their citizens, the United States business community must make a greater effort to become involved with the Russian economy.
Germany's involvement is helping both the Russian and German economies. We should learn a lesson from them.

HEADLINE: Compassion Belongs In American Politics

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Frederick L. Kopff's May 18 letter about Federal fiscal policy does a disservice to Representative Martin Olav Sabo, a Minnesota Democrat who has long worked to attack our budget problems and address America's growing income inequality. Martin Sabo is a friend and public servant I've known throughout his distinguished career. 
 In 1993, as chairman of the Budget Committee, Representative Sabo guided the most significant deficit-reduction plan in history through the House. That plan trimmed hundreds of billions of dollars in projected red ink and led to three consecutive years of lower deficits.
At that time, Republicans in the House made the same "socialistic" charges about the plan and claimed it would throw the economy into a recession. However, since then we have seen unprecedented economic growth, lower unemployment, millions of new jobs and soaring corporate profits. Certainly, Mr. Kopff must agree that these are products of a healthy capitalistic economy.
Mr. Sabo is also right to be concerned about the economic and social implications of our growing income gap.
In the past 20 years, we have seen a growing polarization of income between rich and poor, which has lowered living standards for millions of working American families.
It is not socialistic for those in public service to work for both lower deficits and higher wages for all Americans.

HEADLINE: Les Aspin, 56, Dies; Member of Congress And Defense Chief

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
Les Aspin, a Democratic representative from Wisconsin for 22 years and Secretary of Defense in the first 11 months of the Clinton Administration, died tonight at Georgetown University Medical Center.
He was 56 and suffered a stroke on Saturday. 
 Michael Tebo, a spokesman for the medical center, said Mr. Aspin died at 7:55 P.M. He said that Mr. Aspin was "lucid, awake and speaking" when he was admitted to the hospital at 9:30 A.M. on Saturday but that "despite intensive medical intervention over the next 34 hours his medical condition continued to deteriorate."
Mr. Aspin had a history of problems with his circulatory system. He was hospitalized in March 1993 after complaining of shortness of breath, and a pacemaker was inserted then to regulate his heart's rhythm.
Mr. Aspin was elected to Congress in 1970 in large part because of his opposition to the war in Vietnam, and in his early years in Congress he was an outspoken critic of the Pentagon.
But his views shifted after he became chairman of the House Armed Services Committee in 1985. He endorsed much of the military build-up under President Ronald Reagan and was a strong supporter of the war against Iraq under President George Bush.
As Secretary of Defense, Mr. Aspin was involved in some of the toughest international and domestic policy matters faced by the Clinton Administration in its first year. By the end of the year, he was viewed by the White House as indecisive and basically a disappointment. He would probably have been forced from office had he not resigned in December 1993.
He had been working this year as chairman of a Presidential commission charged with reviewing the operations of the nation's intelligence services, particularly the Central Intelligence Agency.
In a statement issued by the White House tonight, President Clinton said Mr. Aspin "rendered our nation extraordinary, selfless service."
"I speak for millions of Americans when mourning the death today of Les Aspin and join many others in saying that he was my friend," Mr. Clinton said. "Les Aspin accomplished greatly because he cared greatly."
John M. Deutch, the Director of Central Intelligence and a friend of Mr. Aspin's for 30 years, said he had lunch with him last Friday at the C.I.A.
"He seemed marvelous," said Mr. Deutch, who was the best man at Mr. Aspin's wedding. He said he and Mr. Aspin, who was instrumental in the selection of Mr. Deutch to head the C.I.A., "were scheming on how to reform the intelligence agency."
Defense Secretary William J. Perry, who was Mr. Aspin's deputy at the Pentagon before replacing him, called Mr. Aspin's death "a loss to the nation, a loss to the men and women of the U.S. military and a loss to me personally."
Leslie Aspin Jr. was born on July 21, 1938, in Milwaukee. His father, who died young of heart disease, was from Yorkshire, England, and immigrated to the United States by way of Canada.
Mr. Aspin earned an undergraduate degree from Yale University, a master's degree from Oxford University and a doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the 1960's, he performed his military service as an economist at the Pentagon under Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara.
After his military service, he worked briefly on the staff of Senator William Proxmire, a Democrat from Wisconsin, and then returned to Wisconsin to enter politics and teach economics at Marquette University. In 1970, at the age of 32, he was elected to the House from a district in southeastern Wisconsin on a platform that stressed his opposition to the war in Vietnam and his advocacy of environmental regulations.
Robert W. Kastenmeier, a Democrat who served for 20 years with Mr. Aspin in the state's Congressional delegation, said that Mr. Aspin was an energetic politician who took a district "where it was hard to get elected as a Democrat, and he made it his own."
In Congress, Mr. Aspin was appointed to the Armed Services Committee and immediately began to attack the close relationship between senior lawmakers and the Pentagon.
Week after week, he issued news releases exposing what he believed to be wasteful Pentagon spending. He criticized a wide range of practices, including poison gas experiments, expensive uniforms for officers, cost overruns in shipbuilding and the care of officers' pets at Government expense. He was also at the forefront of various antiwar efforts in Congress.
At the time, he explained himself this way to a reporter: "You're a junior member of a committee, and you don't have the leverage of a subcommittee or committee chairman, so what do you do?"
In his first years in the House, he was almost constantly at war with F. Edward Hebert, the crusty, hawkish Louisiana Democrat who was then chairman of the Armed Services Committee. In 1975, in one of the first breaks with the practice of selecting chairmen strictly by seniority, Mr. Hebert was ousted by Democrats in the House and replaced with a more malleable chairman, Melvin Price of Illinois. Mr. Aspin was one of the leaders of the uprising.
In the years that followed, Mr. Aspin became less of a gadfly and more of a serious student of the military. By 1985, he was recognized as a leading Congressional authority on Pentagon policy. Then, he organized another coup, driving Mr. Price from his chairmanship and leapfrogging over more senior members to become chairman himself.
By this time, his politics had changed, to the dismay of the liberal wing in his party. He urged fellow Democrats to shed the party's dovish image.
On one of the most divisive policy matters of the time, he supported the development of the multi-warhead MX missile, which many liberals thought was too expensive and disruptive of the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.
On another controversy, he defended United States support of the contras, who were trying to overthrow the communist government of Nicaragua.
In 1987, an unusual coalition of liberal and conservative Democrats tried to strip Mr. Aspin of the chairmanship, but he narrowly survived the challenge.
Four years later, Mr. Aspin argued vigorously in favor of the Bush Administration's policies in the Persian Gulf. Four days before the House voted to authorize the use of military force against Iraq, he wrote a report that many of his colleagues saw as callous. One sentence read: "I believe prospects are high for a rapid victory with light to moderate American casualties, perhaps three to five thousand including 500 to 1,000 dead."
In 1992, along with Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr. Aspin was a chief adviser on military policy to Bill Clinton's Presidential campaign. His selection as Secretary of Defense in December 1992 was generally praised, although some military experts pointed out that he had no experience managing a large organization like the Pentagon.
Mr. Aspin took control of the Pentagon at a time of tremendous upheaval in the post-cold-war world and in the Pentagon itself. Eager to take on the country's shifting international commitments, Mr. Aspin hired mostly academic experts as his main advisers.
He was never as close to President Clinton as Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the national security adviser, Anthony Lake. And he disagreed with the all-or-nothing approach to military engagement of Gen. Colin L. Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Mr. Aspin held that the United States should be prepared to use troops selectively to buttress its diplomacy. In this vein, he suggested that the use of force in Bosnia might be appropriate.
In retrospect, his limited management ability can be seen to have hurt him as Defense Secretary. He tried, sometimes awkwardly, to mediate the prolonged fight between the White House and the military brass over whether to allow homosexuals to serve in the armed forces. He was also widely criticized for deciding not to reinforce American troops in Somalia in the weeks before 18 American soldiers died in a disastrous raid.
He sought to articulate a new vision of what the structure of the military should be. But in an Administration not known for its decisiveness, he often seemed unable to close a discussion and reach a decision.
At the end of his tenure, he was deep in battle with the Office of Management and Budget, which wanted to reduce military spending more than Mr. Aspin's plan to remake the Defense Department's long-range war-fighting strategy could stand. The only way Mr. Clinton could have sided with Mr. Aspin would have been to take money away from domestic programs to spend on the military, a step the President was unlikely to take.
Mr. Aspin was the first Clinton Cabinet member to leave, and Mr. Clinton took pains to portray the resignation as Mr. Aspin's decision. But few doubted at the time that he would have been dropped had he not resigned.
Mr. Aspin was a tall, stoop-shouldered, rumpled figure with thick glasses who began to go bald and gray at a young age. He was divorced in 1979, had no children and never remarried. He periodically entertained at his home in Georgetown, but basically his life was his work.
"Obviously, he was a person who took his job very, very seriously," said Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado, who served with him on the Armed Services Committee. "He was totally wedded to his job 24 hours a day, to the point where he probably sacrificed some of his personal life."
Ms. Schroeder said she often felt that his best friend was his sheepdog, Junket, who often accompanied him to work, and she described that as "very sad."

HEADLINE: Changchun Journal;
Motor City Keeps Communism in the Driver's Seat

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: CHANGCHUN, China

 BODY:
Here in China's Motor City, the culture of Communism is changing so slowly that only recently have the city fathers considered changing the name of Stalin Street to something less ideological.
Changchun is home to the No. 1 Automobile Works, or First Auto, a huge and antiquated industrial combine with a bloated work force of 130,000. Yet China's leaders say they believe that it can become a "pillar" industry, and thus demonstrate that state-owned factories managed by smart Communist Party cadres can not only succeed but can also compete with the likes of Ford and Toyota. 
 "We are fortunate that we have the auto industry to lead the way," said Yin Wen, the city's First Deputy Mayor. "I went to Detroit and I saw the Mayor and I told him that we are turning Changchun into another Detroit, making this our own Motor City. Although the one difference is that in Changchun we have good social order, whereas in Detroit, you don't dare go out at night."
If his statement seemed tinged with nationalism, so does the billboard outside First Auto: "I am a No. 1 Auto Man, Building Industry and Vying for First Place."
Ideology still runs deep in parts of China, like the big coal seams that run under the timberland. And while much of southern and coastal China resemble free-market zones of capitalism, here in northeastern China, the icon of the idealized socialist man working in the idealized socialist enterprise is making a comeback.
"State enterprises, especially the large and medium-sized ones, are the pillars of our economy," Prime Minister Li Peng told the National People's Congress in March.
But a visit to First Auto reveals how an undefined brand of socialism is slowly evolving from the old attitudes of the "iron rice bowl" society, where the worker is cared for from cradle to grave.
Today, despite all the talk of economic reform in the era of Deng Xiaoping, First Auto remains a thoroughly socialist enterprise that sprawls over more than 1,000 acres on the edge of Changchun and is home to 300,000 workers, dependents and pensioners.
The skyline around the automobile city is a mixture of Communist uniformity studded with the occasional remnant of Japanese imperial architecture, owing to Changchun's role as the seat of occupied Manchuria from 1931 to 1945.
"The city of Changchun was occupied by the Japanese for 14 years," Mr. Yin said. "Now we are welcoming the Japanese to come back to the northeast and invest."
Over the years, the company town has also provided 1,000 apartment buildings for more than 30,000 families. The factory operates more than 26 schools as well as 10 kindergartens for the more than 20,000 pre-schoolers.
All of this for a plant that barely produces 200,000 vehicles a year, about one-quarter the output of a large American or European auto plant. Plant officials acknowledge that there are large numbers of idle and surplus workers, but plead that they have not come upon a scientific technique for weeding them out.
There is talk in Beijing that the Government and foreign investors will pump billions of dollars over the next five years to quadruple First Auto's production to one million vehicles a year, part of a national strategy to develop an affordable "people's car."
Volkswagen came here in 1988 with a production line for an expensive series of black Audi sedans, increasingly the favorite car for China's Communist Party bosses now that driving a Mercedes can lead to the opening of a corruption investigation. A second Volkswagen domestic production line for Jettas and Golfs is now under construction.
Though the factory's managers hope one day to shed their social welfare burdens, significant reforms remain somewhere out in the future.
"We would like to cut them off," said Li Shuzheng, the plant's Communist Party official responsible for propaganda and meeting foreign journalists. "Our socialist enterprises are different from those in capitalist countries. We just can't let too many people flow out into society and be unemployed."
First Auto is a success story in Jilin Province, where 46 percent of the state-owned factories are losing money and where 120,000 workers have been sent home by factories that have no work.
The flagship of China's widely dispersed state auto industry of about 120 plants, the car maker here says it made money in 1994, declaring a profit of $107 million on $2.4 billion in sales. But Mr. Li declined to explain how the company accounts for the substantial debt and other liabilities that are routinely excluded from profit calculations.
Unwilling to provide an annual report or any statistics about the auto maker's performance or financial condition, Mr. Li said, "Some of this stuff is secret." What First Auto wants from foreigners, he added, is technology and investment without a lot of questions.

Baltimore Mayor Urges Yale Graduates to Embrace Nation's Cities

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, May 21

 BODY:
Saying that American cities are as vital to the nation as the Sun is to the Earth, Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke of Baltimore urged graduates of Yale University today to live, work and thrive in the nation's urban centers.
In a speech at Yale's Class Day, a day before commencement, when 2,892 undergraduate and graduate degrees will be conferred, Mr. Schmoke said that the United States cannot afford to lose the analytical and creative skills of millions of city youths, nor have them growing up frustrated and underemployed. 
 "Whether you spent your four years at Yale studying science, management, art, language, computers, there's a home and a future for you in our cities," said Mr. Schmoke, who graduated from Yale College in 1971. "We need your talent. We need your optimism."
Mr. Schmoke also told the students that Forrest Gump got it wrong when he compared life to a box of chocolates and claimed people never knew what they were going to get. With a box of chocolates, he noted, people at least know they will get chocolates.
"Life is not about what you get," Mr. Schmoke said. "Life is about what you do."
 
Southampton College
 SOUTHAMPTON, L.I., May 21 -- Their velvet-trimmed academic robes concealing Grateful Dead T-shirts, Bennett R. Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, of ice cream fame, called on graduates of the Southampton Center of Long Island University today to look beyond profit in their dealings with the world. Then they distributed "peace pops" as the college conferred degrees on 256 undergraduates and 23 graduate students.
Mr. Cohen and Mr. Greenfield, the founders of Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc., described their joint stumble into becoming multimillionaires. It was left to Mr. Cohen to describe how he and his partner had coped with success and to call on the graduates to recognize that there is a "spiritual aspect to businesses just as to individuals."
"The good you do comes back to you, and just because this is written in the Bible instead of in a business text doesn't mean it doesn't apply to businesses," he said.
Mr. Cohen criticized government officials who have "no problem finding billions for the savings and loan bailout" but neglect social needs. "How can you face the child coming home from a disintegrating school building, walking through streets that are garbage-strewn and filled with gunfire and say you just don't have the money?" he asked.
 
Manhattan College
 In a ceremony that had the aura of a high-stakes game, Manhattan College graduates celebrated yesterday both their commencement and their basketball team's first victory in a National Collegiate Athletic Association championship game in 37 years.
Still glowing over the Jaspers' upset of Oklahoma, the first such win since 1958, Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers, adopted the tone of a coach sending his team out of the locker room. "Don't ever bank on pure luck," he told the 500 graduates in the gymnasium of the college's campus in Riverdale, the Bronx. "The key to success is not just to make a decision, but to execute that decision. I learned this in political campaigning where everyone loves to sit around solving problems by coming up with a strategy. This accomplishes little."
While in college, Mr. Powers managed an unsuccessful campaign for student body president for his current boss, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Both graduated in 1965.
Mr. Powers said: "If you asked a lot of people in this city who we are, they would say, 'Oh yes, the Mayor and the First Deputy Mayor.' If you asked us, we would say, 'We are a couple of Christian Brothers boys who wouldn't be where we are without the brothers and Manhattan College.' "
 
Hofstra University
 HEMPSTEAD, L.I., May 21 -- Under sunny skies, 1,020 undergraduates and 780 graduate students received their diplomas today in the football stadium at Hofstra University. The 800 graduates of the Hofstra College of Liberal Arts and Sciences received some insight about the corporate world.
Edward V. Regan, the former New York State Comptroller who is now the policy adviser to the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College, said that the business world is presently in the throes of "relentless restructuring and re-engineering."
"There is no more joining I.B.M. or Kodak with the expectation of having a job for life," he said. "Loyalty to company has been substituted with loyalty to one's profession."

HEADLINE: SCIENCE RESEARCH WOULD BE HIT HARD IN BUDGET CUTTING

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
The glory days of the Federal science establishment may be over, science leaders fear, as cuts proposed by Republicans to wipe out the budget deficit fall hard on civilian research.
Under the cuts, annual appropriations for nonmilitary research might drop to about $25 billion by 2000 from the current level of $32 billion. The reductions over that period would total $24 billion or more. 
 At risk is the type of Government-financed basic science that has put men on the moon, explored the deep sea, unlocked the atom, cured cancers, found the remains of lost civilizations, tracked earthquake faults, and discovered the chemistry of life, among other feats.
Specific casualties of the cuts might include atom smashers, new weather satellites, space probes and dozens of large Federal laboratories that study everything from solar power to violent storms.
Republicans say their goal is to trim fat and corporate welfare rather than cripple basic science, which economists agree is a powerful engine for promoting economic growth and high standards of living.
Representative Robert S. Walker, the Pennsylvania Republican who heads the House Science Committee, said this month that the proposed budget would keep "a robust science policy while providing for the fundamental science base we need to move forward."
But Democrats and private experts say the cuts would undo the Federal science establishment, crippling parts of it beyond repair.
To be sure, science leaders in past budget battles, clearly working in their own self-interest, have been known to exaggerate how painful reductions might be. And some pain might be averted as Democrats and Federal agencies fight the cuts, or if President Clinton successfully vetoes spending bills.
Even so, the momentum for change is now so great that many private experts, as well as Democrats, say Federal support of civilian science is destined to weaken and shrink no matter what, its budget declining by as much as a third if inflation is taken into account. Such cuts portend wide changes in American science and American life.
"Any sensible person knows you have to make prudent investments to get ahead," Representative George E. Brown Jr., a California Democrat who once headed the House Science Committee, said in an interview last week. "But the Government doesn't. We're dominated by fools."
Agency heads, university officials and private experts say the fabric of science is likely to fray widely as the Republican juggernaut rolls forward and as the Clinton Administration makes its own cuts in an attempt to regain lost political ground.
"Nationally, there's been a massive sticking of heads in the sand, of not looking at the problem," said John Wiley, provost at the University of Wisconsin, one of the nation's top science schools. "There's going to be a price to pay."
Experts say the repercussions could include the abandoning of much long-term environmental monitoring, the virtual end of applied research to aid corporations, layoffs at colleges and universities, and a flight of students from scientific careers.
"We don't want to get so lost in the frenzy to balance the budget that we throw babies out with the bath water," John H. Gibbons, President Clinton's science adviser and director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in an interview.
"Whatever the reduction is -- a quarter or a third -- it's big, and it's a reversal of historical trends," he added, referring to how Republican cuts would end years of budget growth.
"There's no question that we have to be sharper with our knives, to streamline the agencies," Dr. Gibbons said. "But if you take away a third, that's going to push us way down in terms of international competition."
During the last four decades, the Federal Government has spent nearly $1 trillion on civilian research and development, laying the basis for a powerful wave of prosperity that has touched most facets of American life. In pushing back the frontiers of knowledge, the Federal money has supported tens of thousands of scientists at universities across the country and has financed the work that led to scores of Nobel Prizes.
Spending on nonmilitary science has grown fairly steadily in the last decade. It peaked this year at $31.9 billion, according to the National Science Foundation, a Federal agency that finances much basic research at universities.
The civilian science budget of the Federal government is puny compared to the $100 billion that American industry is putting into research and development this year. Yet its importance is greater than size alone suggests, for while industry typically looks years ahead, aiming to please shareholders, the Government often looks decades and sometimes centuries ahead, pursuing fundamental issues of understanding that may ultimately lead to wide social benefits.
Another difference is that industrial science is often shrouded in secrecy. By contrast, Government-financed civilian work is usually published openly so it can serve as intellectual kindling for other social and commercial endeavors.
After their sweep in the midterm elections last November, the Republicans devised a balanced-budget plan that went easy on military research, currently about $40 billion a year, and hard on civilian science, especially on Federal programs with ties to industry. An aim of the Clinton Administration has been to help high-technology industries better compete with foreign rivals.
House Republicans produced the most detailed plan for science cuts, which was endorsed Thursday by the full House as part of a comprehensive package to balance the budget by 2002. The Senate is debating a companion measure.
Democrats of the House Science Committee portray the House plan as an extensive cracking of the foundations of Federal science. By their calculation, spending under the committee's jurisdiction would fall by a total $24 billion from 1996 to 2000, relative to 1995 levels. If 3 percent annual inflation is assumed during that period, the overall drop would be 34.7 percent in terms of real purchasing power.
The committee oversees most civilian science spending in the Federal budget, with responsibility for $27.2 billion this year. The exceptions are the National Institutes of Health and the Agriculture and Interior Departments. The latter's Geological Survey, which monitors water, hunts minerals and makes maps, has been targeted for eventual elimination by the Republicans. Its current budget is $571 million.
The biggest cuts are slated for the Federal Government's largest scientific agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Among possible victims is tiny Pioneer 10, now nearly six billion miles from Earth and still sending back data more than two decades after it was launched.
"A lot more than Pioneer will go," NASA's administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, said in an interview.
The Republicans would squeeze a series of planned satellites for global climate monitoring, trimming the budget by $2.7 billion, or about half, to the end of the decade. Over all, the agency's annual budget would drop to $11 billion from $14.3 billion by 2000.
On Friday, Mr. Goldin outlined a plan that would move toward eventually turning over operation of the space shuttles to private industry, something the Republicans have called for. The NASA plan would also reduce the work force of the agency and its contractors by about 25,000 people, bringing it to 1961 levels.
"We're right at the edge," he said. "The Republican cuts would roughly double that, pushing another 20,000 people out the door."
A similar tale comes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, whose parent, the Commerce Department, has been targeted for elimination by the Republicans. Among other things, NOAA runs weather satellites, makes forecasts, tracks hurricanes and tornadoes, probes the deep ocean and monitors fisheries.
James D. Baker, NOAA's Administrator, said in an interview that the agency was already losing 2,300 employees and that the proposed Republican cuts would trim another 1,000 in 1996 alone. Its budget for that year would fall to $1.7 billion from a current $2 billion, with deeper cuts in following years.
"What we see coming is a real tragedy," he said. "We'll have to cut services and stop future investments on all kinds of things."
NOAA runs 11 environmental research labs around the country to study things like air quality, climate changes and severe storms. Some labs would have to be cut back or closed down. And proposed Republican cuts for 1996 would force the agency to abandon plans for a new weather satellite.
Ultimately, NOAA officials say, lives will be at risk if weather forecasts decline in quality.
"We're a service agency," said Douglas K. Hall, NOAA's Deputy Administrator. "We have people on duty 24 hours a day at the nation's airports. They're critical to the safety of millions of Americans."
More esoteric is the work of the Energy Department, which studies new kinds of solar and geothermal energy production, struggles to harness the nearly limitless power of nuclear fusion, and probes the atom with big particle accelerators. It also is conducting a costly cleanup of sites contaminated by decades of nuclear weapons production.
Its current budget is $17.5 billion. The Republicans would cut that by a total of $7 billion over five years.
The department says the cuts would trim 2,000 university science jobs and 3,500 jobs from its sprawling system of laboratories, would end the large fusion experiment at Princeton University and would force the cancellation of one of its atom-smasher projects. In addition, hundreds of companies, universities and Federal laboratories that are trying to improve energy efficiency would lose funds.
One bright spot in the Republican proposal is the National Science Foundation, whose current budget is $3.3 billion. The Republicans would slightly boost basic research to match expected inflation but would squeeze the social sciences, which include economics, anthropology, psychology, sociology, geography and archeology.
The National Institutes of Health, the nation's biomedical research giant and a main patron of university research, would also get some preferential treatment. Its $11.3 billion budget would drop slightly in 1996 and then freeze. Even without severe reductions, however, N.I.H. officials say their programs would be devastated by inflation.
For the nation's system of big research universities, said Dr. Wiley of the University of Wisconsin, "there's likely to be a shakeout" as the cuts hit home and universities shut down programs.
"We'll probably emerge from the next 15 or 20 years with far fewer universities that try to be comprehensive," he said.
Robert L. Park, a physicist at the University of Maryland and a spokesman for the American Physical Society, the nation's leading group of physicists, said the race between Republicans and Democrats to make science cuts boded ill for the future.
"Enormous promises have been made and it's hard to see how they can back away from those," he said, referring to the Republican promise to balance the budget.
"Social Security and most of Medicare is off the table," he added. "There's not much left in the discretionary budget except for science."

China's 'Four Fears'

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The television series soaring in popularity in China is about the exploits of Bao Qingtian, a magistrate of the Song Dynasty.
This legendary judge of a thousand years ago is shown dispensing evenhanded justice, punishing wrong doers and exposing lawless government officials. The TV series is produced in Taiwan but can be seen in mainland China because it seems to be politically noncontroversial. 
 What makes the show such a hit, however, is its implicit criticism of corruption on high. Such kickback economics is rampant in China today, making millionaires out of relatives of Communist leaders, Deng Xiaoping's son famously included.
That is one tea leaf in the reading of the rising tide of popular resentment in the world's most populous nation. China today is showing all the signs of being on the brink of a major upheaval.
On the eve of the sixth anniversary of the repression of freedom in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, longtime dissidents are being rounded up; scholarly signers of petitions for reform are being harassed and jailed; designated "troublemakers" from all over China are being denied entry to the capital.
As Deng Xiaoping prepares to "meet Marx," the sclerotic regime he leaves behind -- embracing the dangerous excesses of capitalism without its saving freedoms -- is left to face the "four fears."
First is the average Chinese consumer's fear of being robbed by inflation, now over 20 percent -- which means that half of what he saves disappears after four years. The economic chief, Zhu Rongji, once a reformist who Richard Nixon thought might become the savior of China, has reverted to regulation, central control and protection of state-owned defense monoliths.
Second is the workers' fear of growing underemployment -- commu-capitalism's dirty secret -- especially away from the prosperous coast. Inland workers are migrating eastward, overcrowding cities and driving down wages, worsening inflation's impact.
Third is fear of the anger of farmers, their land encroached on by industrialization, who now prefer to sell to local entities and black markets than to Beijing's state purchasers. As in pre-revolutionary days, food shortages loom.
Finally, there is the well-founded fear in Beijing of some expression of the people's disgust at pervasive corruption. That explains not just the popularity of a Song Dynasty Perry Mason, but the willingness of Deng's hand-picked successor to crack down on a ring of grafters in Beijing's city government who make Tammany's Boss Tweed look like an innocent.
In the sincere syntax of Sinology, President Jiang Zemin's arrest of the head of the Communist Party in Beijing -- a sleaze who was promoted to the Politburo for his brutality in crushing the Tiananmen demonstration -- is perceived as a way for the transitional Jiang to gently dissociate himself from Deng's increasingly hated hard-liners.
Too many of us fall for subtle interpretations of maneuvering inside the Forbidden City as if it were comparable to jockeying for leadership within our Republican Party.
Forget that inside Ping-Pong, because the stakes are of a different magnitude: The after-Deng convulsion will determine whether a billion-plus people will progress toward democratic stability -- or regress to the rigid totalitarianism that would lead to civil war within a nuclear power.
That's why we should be more actively on the side of the dissident scholars and students, publicizing their arrests, demanding their release, embarrassing their harassers.
That's why we should identify ourselves with courageous workers like the electrician Wei Jingsheng, jailed 15 years ago for wall posters protesting corruption, now held incommunicado lest his voice reach a new generation of workers. (A Nobel prize would help.)
That's why we should align ourselves with Asian decentralized democracy, protesting human rights abuses in Tibet; welcoming official visitors from Taiwan; using our market muscle to encourage freer enterprise.
The "four fears" may produce brittle dictators or leaders not fearful of freedom. We should know who to root for and be willing to use what influence we have.

1939
The Lost World of the Fair
By David Gelernter
Illustrated. 418 pages. Free Press. $23.
Considering that the 1939 New York World's Fair envisioned a future of cars, superhighways and technological triumph, one can understand why a contemporary observer might not look back at the event with feelings of nostalgia. Yet that is exactly what David Gelernter does in his new book, "1939: The Lost World of the Fair," which is part fiction, part history, part sociology and part prophecy. 
 He argues that in certain respects the time of the fair was a better one than today and that part of what we have lost in the meantime is the vision that inspired the fair. What we have lost, he writes, is the optimism that the fair embodied, even at a time when the American economy had barely started up again and Europe was facing catastrophic war. As the fictional Hattie Levine puts it in an imagined interview with the narrator: "The fair had a remarkable mood and feel to it. At least for us. It was an air of . . . . I don't want to lapse into rosy romanticism. I'm skeptical of it. But what I want to say is, acute hope."
 The fictional parts of "1939" are a surprise coming from Mr. Gelernter, a professor of computer science at Yale University and the author of two previous books, "Mirror Worlds: Or the Day Software Puts the Universe in a Shoebox," and "The Muse in the Machine." They are built out of conversations with Mrs. Levine, who is obviously a composite of actual people who recall the fair, and out of selections from a diary the author invents for her. The novel within "1939" serves the useful purpose of giving us a spectator's view of a day at the fair, from a ride through General Motors' Futurama, one of the fair's great hits, to a parachute jump on the machine that today stands useless at Coney Island.
But the story that Mrs. Levine tells is highly predictable and wastes far too much space rather heavy-handedly underlining the author's theories, mainly through an endless discussion between a younger version of Mrs. Levine and her fiance-to-be over whether to bring children into a world about to go to war. Mrs. Levine's outlook is far better dramatized in E. L. Doctorow's novel "World's Fair," a book that Mr. Gelernter never acknowledges, even in his lengthy bibliography, although he mentions Mr. Doctorow in another context.
Mr. Gelernter's points are also far better made in the nonfiction parts of his book. Here he argues that the technological vision that informed the fair amounted to a "civic religion" that "made eschatological predictions: It promised a utopian future to believers, in the end of days." The author continues: "And then an amazing thing happened -- a thing without parallel, so far as I know, in the whole history of religion: In the years following the Second World War, those utopian promises came true."
Americans got the cars, the highways and the suburban homes equipped with gadgetry that the fair promised, the author contends. Americans became richer, better fed, more in command of their world. "It's not utopia, we point out, it's just suburbia," writes Mr. Gelernter, imagining a dialogue between today and 1939. "But that is what we longed for, says 1939, and you have got it. Promise made, promise kept."
Yet having achieved the dream, people lost the vision, the author says. Having entered the future, they lost a view of the future. This explains why in a better time, we feel worse. "When a person loses his religious faith, it is not that God's character seems to change; God disappears," Mr. Gelernter writes. "Religion is above all a matter of seeing. . . . Today, by dint of achieving the utopian future, we have lost our faith and see nothing."
All of which makes sense, so far as it goes. Yet somehow it also leaves everything out. Mr. Gelernter mentions the Vietnam War as a possible source of contemporary disillusionment; "also rock music and drugs and things like that." He adds that "a change as deep as the one we experienced ought not to happen merely on the basis of external events." Yet he never touches on certain more significant events.
He mentions bombing and Guernica, but never the bomb that high technology produced. He insists that people in the 1930's were sensitive to nature, but he never brings up what uncontrolled technology, particularly involving cars, has done to the environment. He writes that "the search for bigger and better Frankensteins has gone forward," without seeming to be aware of the negative import of Mary Shelley's invention. In short, he never acknowledges any of the deeper causes of the loss of faith in technology. He merely asserts that we're unhappy because our dreams have come true.
Still, if "1939" is weak on the woes of the present, it is strong on the pleasures of the past. Through the eyes of Mr. Gelernter's fictional witness, the reader can sense the wonder of the fair. "When it is almost nine we walk (just as everyone else is walking) towards the Lagoon of Nations & the display there is indescribable," the younger Hattie records in her diary. "At the climax, everything is turned off at once, lights, fountains, flame & music -- the waters crash back into the pool with the roar of a breaker driving into a cliff, & the sudden black is immense & a little frightening & incomparably dramatic. For a few moments no one moves. The show is amazing. And it recalls many other things at this Fair in being simply unlike anything you have ever seen before."
"I have seen the future," declared the buttons that people received at the end of the Futurama ride. And for a while you share Mr. Gelernter's longing for a time when that future was good.

HEADLINE: Japanese Critics Say Schools Pushed Best and Brightest Into Sect's Arms

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 21

 BODY:
Koichi Ishikawa was a brilliant, dedicated student at a top high school, passed Japan's toughest entrance exam to study medicine at Tokyo University and was destined for a promising career.
Then he joined Aum Shinrikyo, the religious sect suspected of staging the poison gas attack on the subway system that killed a dozen people and injured 5,500. Now Mr. Ishikawa, 26 years old, is sitting in a jail cell, a suspect in various crimes committed by Aum. 
 In cells nearby are his Aum comrades, also graduates of Japan's equivalents of Harvard, Princeton and Yale, trained scientists who proved that they had what it takes to get ahead.
As Japan struggles to assess what went wrong with these serious, smart young people, many scholars and commentators are pointing their fingers in an unusual direction: the schools. Japan may have one of the world's most admired educational systems, but the critics say it teaches young people to memorize instead of to think.
Young people spend so much time hunched over desks, the critics say, that they fail to develop sufficient social skills. Many of them -- and they seem to be more common in Japan -- resemble the stereotype of the computer nerd: brilliant and driven, but utterly lost when in human company.
 
Inability to Discern Basic Human Values
 "It reflects a profound crisis in the educational system," said Alfons Deeken, a longtime Japanese-speaking professor of philosophy at Sophia University in Tokyo. "Many Japanese students are absorbing ever greater amounts of information, but they don't acquire the ability to make value judgments on basic human values like responsibility for human life or respect for freedom of the individual."
Typically, Japanese students attend school for about 240 days a year, one-third longer than American students. In addition, many go to cram schools or after-school lessons almost as soon as they learn to read, and they test their way into classes from kindergarten to college.
They are taking calculus when American students are struggling through geometry, and English about the same time that many Americans are learning their rules of grammar. But while many Japanese have studied English for nearly a decade by the time they reach college, very few can speak it.
Perhaps that is indicative of the system: students are able to absorb rules and vocabulary but often cannot use what they have learned in the real world.
 
No Plan to Develop Mature Personalities
 "These guys in the science division have no time to relax," said Yoichi Masuzoe, a former politics professor at Tokyo University who taught some of the Aum members but hardly remembers them. "They should have read more literature, like Shakespeare. Then they could have learned what human beings are. They lack an understanding of human nature."
Takeshi Sasaki, a professor of political science at Tokyo University, was more pointed. "In this society, there isn't any organization which can train young talented people into mature personalities," he said. "The deficiency in social relations in Japan is a serious issue. Social relations are more or less being destroyed by the examination-centered life."
Scholars, of course, do not blame Japan's educational system entirely for Aum's terrorism, and by many standards the system is a model one. Many Americans would love to have Japanese-style schools, which do an admirable job in teaching reading, writing and trigonometry. Japanese students often have some of the highest average test scores in international comparisons.
There is also no doubt that Aum's techniques in recruitment and mind control play a more direct role in roping in its members. But the complaint is that in turning out naive, vulnerable students, Japan's schools leave the students as open prey for a charismatic leader like Aum's guru, Shoko Asahara, a 40-year-old yoga expert.
College students are often searching for explanations to life that cannot be found in their textbooks. And Mr. Asahara, with his flowing pink robes, open arms and assertions that Aum is the key to enlightenment, may appear as a fatherly savior to them.
Fumihiro Joyu, the sect's 32-year-old spokesman and a graduate of Waseda University, told an interviewer recently that he joined the sect because it gave him a purpose in life.
"I wanted my life to be meaningful," he said. "I did not want my life to be meaningless."
Mr. Asahara, who was arrested on Tuesday in his hideout, had insisted on complete obedience from his disciples. But once they proved their loyalty, they were apparently given substantial freedoms, important jobs in the organization and prestigious titles.
At least 11 of Asahara's top disciples -- effectively his cabinet members -- were educated in science and engineering at top universities, where experimental laboratory budgets are tiny and competition is fierce. Some say that Aum basically bought out these scientists. They were given enormous sums of money to pursue research projects, so long as the research advanced Aum's interests.
 
Bond With the Guru, Then Blindly Obey
 "It is a big jump to believe in the guru," said Akira Asada, an economics professor at Kyoto University. "But once they make the jump, they are simply given freedom and financial support to pursue maniacal projects."
Of course, the motivations for joining the cult are easier to understand than those for committing mass murder. But the very strong sense of identity with Mr. Asahara, and of loyalty to the sect rather than to society, may have helped cultivate a blind obedience.
"I kept hesitating because I realized many people would die," Ikuo Hayashi told the police in a jail-house confession, according to the newspaper Asahi. Dr. Hayashi, a cardiac surgeon and Aum official, is said to have confessed to taking part in the subway attack.
"Again and again, I tried to stop what I was about to do, but I was unable to disobey the sect's orders," the Asahi quoted Dr. Hayashi as saying.
Another example is Hideo Murai, who graduated from Osaka University. Specializing in aerospace physics, Mr. Murai worked for Kobe Steel doing research in aerospace technology before he became an Aum member.
He soon won the trust of Mr. Asahara and became the head of the sect's "science and technology" department. In this position, he is believed to have been given an important challenge: to help organize the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway on March 20.
But Mr. Murai may have done or known too much. He once revealed that Aum had assets worth 100 billion yen, or nearly $1.2 billion. In April Mr. Murai was fatally stabbed by a member of an underworld gang.
Mr. Murai's disclosure remains one of the mysteries of Aum. While Aum demanded that its 10,000 Japanese members donate all their possessions to the sect when they joined, it is still unclear how or why Aum accumulated such large assets.
It has led some scholars to suspect that Mr. Asahara was intent on building some sort of empire. Mr. Asahara's motives are unclear, but some say he had both material and political ambitions and had set up a hierarchical structure to support those goals.
"It was similar to the Nazi Party and the Stalinist system in that the same kind of mass hypnotism exists," said Hiroyoshi Ishikawa, a professor of social psychology at Seijo University. "The young people in the group have many frustrations and are discontent with society. In this situation, the group can easily become a big psychological apparatus, a psychological machine that substitutes their frustration with revolution."
Partly blind, Mr. Asahara showed a desire to be a leader while attending a school for the blind. His eyesight was apparently stronger than that of the other children and he would often strike a deal with them: he would lead them all to a restaurant in exchange for their paying for his meals.
As a young man, Mr. Asahara appears to have been unusually ambitious -- or, as people now say, obsessed with power. He told a number of acquaintances, for example, that he wanted to be Prime Minister.
In 1990 Mr. Asahara ran for Parliament and lost. Giving up on the electoral system, he sought power in other ways. His organization was growing into a mini-nation, a state within a state with cabinet members and various ministries from health and welfare to finance and self-defense.
Moreover, he had begun to amass a giant stockpile of tons of chemicals, some of which are suspected of being used to make sarin gas. Meanwhile, he was telling his followers about an imminent World War III, an Armageddon that would strike the world but permit Aum to survive.
"Asahara is a total materialist," said Yoshiya Abe, a religion professor at Kokugakuin University. "He's interested in assuming assets and acquiring control. Power and money."
Some scholars say Mr. Asahara staged the gas attack on the subway as a way of waging war on the Japanese Government. But it is still far from clear exactly how the sarin gas attack fit into his overall grand designs.
One theory is that having predicted Armageddon, he wanted to make it come true.
Another is simply that he was obsessed by power, including the power to use toxic chemicals and see their effects.
A third theory has to do with reports that Mr. Asahara is in poor health, that he is dying of one ailment or another. Thus Mr. Asahara, newly reminded of his own mortality, wanted to lead people not only in life but into death as well.
The one person who could shed the most light on this is Shoko Asahara himself, but he is not saying much. He sits in his jail cell, exchanging small talk with the police but insisting on his innocence and refusing to enter substantive interrogation.
"How could a blind man like me commit such a crime?" Mr. Asahara is said to have told the police soon after his arrest. "But I don't think you will believe what I'm saying."

HEADLINE: Aides to Clinton Say He Will Defy Beijing and Issue Visa to Taiwan's President

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
President Clinton has decided to grant a visa to the President of Taiwan, senior Administration officials said today. The action would break a 16-year-old policy and risk retaliation by China, which vehemently opposes the move on the ground that the United States has no official relations with Taiwan.
The officials said President Clinton had decided to risk a run-in with China by admitting President Lee Teng-hui because of intense pressure from the Republican-dominated Congress. 
 Earlier this month, the Senate voted 97 to 1 and the House 396 to 0 to urge Mr. Clinton to reverse the longstanding policy and allow Mr. Lee to attend Cornell University's alumni reunion next month in Ithaca, N.Y.
With this move and the decision to impose trade sanctions on Japanese cars, President Clinton will in one week have angered the two most powerful Asian Governments, China and Japan, at a time when many experts on Asia say American relations with the world's most dynamic continent are already strained.
No President of Taiwan has been allowed to visit the United States since 1979, when the United States adopted a policy that recognizes Beijing as the sole Government of China. Until then, Washington had recognized the Chinese Nationalists, who fled mainland China for Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Communists, as the legitimate Chinese Government.
Under intense pressure from China, the United States now maintains only unofficial ties with Taiwan, which the Government in Beijing views as a breakaway province.
A senior Administration official said that when Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, and Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff met China's Ambassador to the United States, Li Daoyu, on Saturday to inform him of the decision, Mr. Li said his Government was "very unhappy." Another official said the Ambassador responded that his country would have "a sharp reaction."
A spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry in Beijing, asked about the decision to allow Lee Teng-hui to visit the United States, said that the ministry would not have any immediate comment.
Shortly after Congress adopted its resolution urging that President Lee be granted a visa, China's Foreign Ministry said that admitting him for either an offical or a private visit would have "serious consequences."
American diplomats acknowledged today that they feared that China might somehow retaliate, but they added that they had sought to assuage the Chinese by saying Congressional pressure was making such a decision inevitable.
"We expect China to be unhappy about this, but we'll have to wait and see exactly how they react," said a senior State Department official, who said the visa did not signal a change in the Administration's policy toward China or Taiwan.
In discussing the decision, which is expected to be announced on Monday, members of the Administration sought to minimize the likelihood of an angry Chinese response by noting that President's Lee trip would be a short, private visit in which he would not meet any American officials.
Mr. Lee, who received a doctorate in agricultural economics from Cornell in 1968, has been invited to be the main speaker at the university's alumni weekend, from June 8 to 10.
China is expected to accuse the United States of violating a commitment by admitting Mr. Lee because last September, after a long policy review, the Administration assured China's Government that President Lee would not be allowed into the country except for a transit stop for safety, comfort or convenience. Last May, his plane was allowed to stop in Hawaii to refuel, but the Administration barred him from staying overnight and meeting friends.
Even though they excluded Mr. Lee in the past, State Department officials said they liked him, and they praised him for solidifying democracy in Taiwan.
Republicans in Congress welcomed the decision. "The White House had to address the realities in Congress," said Senator Frank Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who sponsored the resolution on Taiwan in the Senate. "When we look at the significance of President Lee in the development of Taiwan -- they'll have free elections this year -- keeping him out was a situation that had to end, and I'm glad to see President Clinton move on it."
One senior official acknowledged that the nonbinding resolution approved by Congress had forced the Administration's hand, since continuing to bar Mr. Lee would give the impression that Mr. Clinton was bowing to Chinese pressure.
The President has sought to shake that image since last May, when he extended China's preferential trade status even though its human rights performance fell far short of what he had demanded.
When Mr. Lake and Mr. Tarnoff met with Ambassador Li, they told the Chinese diplomat that if Mr. Clinton did not soon grant a visa to Taiwan's President, Congress might overwhelmingly adopt a binding resolution that would not only require him to do so, but would also upgrade the American relationship with Taiwan -- something that China bitterly opposes.
"The Taiwan issue is very important symbolically for China and we have to manage it very carefully," a senior State Department official said. "There was a desire by this Administration to pre-empt new binding legislation that could hurt our relations with China."
Administration officials said they had no idea whether or how China might retaliate. After President Bush announced plans in 1992 to sell F-16's to Taiwan, China protested and, many Asia experts say, retaliated by ignoring American pleas not to sell missile technology to Pakistan and nuclear technology to Iran.
"The Chinese aren't going to like this one bit," said Harry Harding, an expert on China who is dean of the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University. "It's possible, even likely, that they will take some retaliatory action. It's difficult to know what they will do, but I think when they find an issue that is more important to us than to them, they will decide not to be cooperative."
Administration officials say Secretary of State Warren Christopher overruled some low-level officials when he recommended to the President last week that Mr. Lee be admitted. Several Asia experts in the State Department opposed granting Mr. Lee a visa, fearing that it would do too much damage to relations with China when Mr. Christopher's diplomatic vision is to try to maintain strong relations with the world's major powers.
But some other advisers were recommending a visa for Mr. Lee to avoid a high-stakes showdown with Congress that the White House was likely to lose. Their fear was that Congress would adopt a binding resolution to admit Mr. Lee with enough of a majority to withstand a Presidential veto.
"We will be quite delighted if President Lee is able to attend the alumni reunion weekend," said Henrik Dullea, Cornell's vice president for university relations. "It will be the capstone of the weekend."
Cornell's President, Frank H. T. Rhodes, had urged the Administration to admit Mr. Lee, as had a petition from students, faculty and alumni.
One factor that weighed in the decision, Administration officials said, was that China was slowly increasing economic ties and unofficial diplomatic exchanges with Taiwan even as it pressed the United States and dozens of other countries to keep contacts with Taiwan to a minimum.

HEADLINE: Government Also Adds to Property Values;
A Tax to Set It Right

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Unlikely Alliances Attack Property Rights Measures" (front page, May 15): There does exist a very appropriate financial mechanism for compensation to property owners. It is the land value increment tax, formerly known as a betterment tax. The idea is old, simple and widely considered fair. 
 An increase in land value, as opposed to changes in the property value resulting from improvements erected on land, is basically an increase in site value. The land owner typically has done nothing to produce the incremental value. This increase usually results from population growth, economic growth and the infrastructural investments made by local governments, such as roads, water supply and sewerage.
These increments are unearned by the property owner and could be taxed away without affecting resource allocation. That is, such taxation would not impair the potential for the land market to assign land to its "highest and best" use.
It is an easy argument that such increments in value fairly belong to society, and not to the land owner. Thus an appropriate source of funds for paying financial compensation for public "takings" of private wealth is to raise revenue from private "takings" of that value created by society. These are called "rents" in economics, which by definition are unearned.
As an example, California farmers who benefit from subsidized water would by this measure have that increase in land value caused by access to subsidized water taxed away, and thus any compensation to be paid would be a perfect wash.
It might cause those who express outrage over the regulations, such as developers, to reconsider their position.

HEADLINE: White House Memo;
Administration Bides Its Time as Budget Debate Start to Boil

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
The Clinton White House has many faces and voices. But when it comes to negotiations on the future shape of the Federal budget, they all speak these days in one portentous rumble: "All in good time," they say.
"This is not the moment for us to offer an alternative," Alice M. Rivlin, director of the Office of Management and Budget, told reporters on Friday morning. 
 Hours later Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the President's chief economic policy adviser, said, "It's not the appropriate moment to propose an alternative."
And the same day, the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said: "The President will, at the proper point, be ready to engage and to offer up some ideas. But, you know, the timing is his choice and not yours."
That strategy reflects not only a remarkable unity of purpose for a White House known for talking out of turn but also the realization that, in the words of one senior Clinton adviser, "the budget is the whole ball game" this year in determining the direction of the Government and Mr. Clinton's prospects for re-election.
Accordingly, under the direction of the White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, who is steeped in budget gamesmanship from his days as chairman of the House Budget Committee, the Administration is singing as one. Ms. Tyson has added senior political and communications aides to the list of top economic advisers who meet twice a week to plan tactics, and any dissenters either keep quiet or have left the Administration, with their advice relegated to the opinion pages of newspapers.
Having passed his own economic plan two years ago without a single Republican vote, and having seen his health care plan picked to pieces by a steady drumbeat of criticism, Mr. Clinton has resolved to torture the Republicans by "explaining" what he thinks their proposals for balancing the Federal budget by 2002 would do to a range of popular programs like Medicare. For the last two weeks he or top aides have done so almost every day.
At the same time, Mr. Clinton has laid out his conditions for cooperation: abandonment of Republican tax cuts, which he contends unfairly favor the wealthy; protection of aid for education and programs like his national service corps, and cuts in the growth of Medicare and Medicaid spending only as part of a broader overhaul of the health care system.
The Republicans have responded by accusing Mr. Clinton of abandoning leadership -- or going AWOL, in the not-so-subtle idiom of the Senate's Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas -- and indeed, the risk of the White House strategy is that Mr. Clinton may look intransigent.
The Administration's approach may be transparent, but like many obvious ideas, it appears to be working, at least in the short term.
The President's popularity is rising in public opinion polls. And the Republicans are at some pains to defend their plans, unable to muster the votes needed to override Mr. Clinton's threatened veto of $16.4 billion worth of cuts in spending for the current year -- cuts that the President says protect roads and building projects at the expense of education and the environment.
On the other hand, Mr. Clinton has not been a font of bold proposals. His own budget message deliberately avoided the hard choices on deeper reductions in the deficit, because he was confident the Republicans would simply seize any cuts he proposed while ignoring his spending preferences, and the Senate defeated his proposal 99 to 0 last week in a symbolic vote intended only to embarrass him.
The real debate is just beginning, and the specific spending and tax bills that will set priorities and perhaps prompt Presidential vetoes will come this summer. Some Democrats, like Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, who is also the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, are already suggesting that the Administration should drop its own proposed tax cuts, which are only about one-third the size of those proposed by House Republicans, as a sign of good faith and willingness to grapple with the deficit.
Ms. Rivlin said: "There will come a moment of negotiation. Exactly what form that'll take is not clear yet. What we have been doing is making clear exactly what we don't like."
Many moderate Democrats and Republicans believe that the White House missed an opportunity for compromise on health care last year. Asked how the Administration's judgment could be expected to be any better now, Ms. Rivlin acknowledged, "We certainly didn't judge things very well last year on the health plan, nor do we have any exact date for when we think is the moment for engagement."
For now, curiosities abound in the role reversal of the two parties since the Republican electoral sweep last fall.
When Mr. Clinton proposed $118 billion in cuts in the growth of Medicare spending to help finance his health care overhaul, Republicans denounced the plan as likely to increase deductibles paid by the elderly and limit participants' choices of doctors. Now the White House registers the same complaints about the Republicans' plans to force up to $300 billion in Medicare savings, with Hillary Rodham Clinton denouncing the proposals as "deep and arbitrary cuts."
Republicans defeated Mr. Clinton's proposed economic stimulus package in 1993 by attacking it as pork barrel spending, pent up and hastily assembled after 12 years of Republican administrations. Last week, the President attacked the Republican plan to cut this year's budget by $16.4 billion as putting pork over people, though he had actually supported some of the protected projects in the past and agreed with all but about $1.5 billion of the choices proposed in the final bill.
Having included significant deficit reduction in his first budget and received almost no discernible credit for it with voters, Mr. Clinton would now let the deficit stay at about $200 billion a year through the turn of the century, and his advisers criticize Republican plans to balance the budget by 2002 as arbitrary and impractical.
The only hint that the Administration finds that switch hard to defend is subtle but widely noted among regulars at White House briefings. When Ms. Rivlin is asked routine questions about the budget, her voice has the smoky timbre of Bette Davis. When she is asked why the Administration is not pursuing deeper deficit reduction, she slides three octaves into the nervous chirp of Betty Boop.

HEADLINE: Of G.O.P. Suitors, 2 Are Just Flirting

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
Maybe they are reacting to a lack of excitement over the current crop of contenders for the Republican Presidential nomination. Maybe they feel a call to greater public service. Or maybe it is plain ego.
Just when it appeared that the field was settled, now come two party luminaries -- one a Washington insider and the other an outsider -- who want it known that they are available for their party's nomination: Speaker Newt Gingrich and Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin. 
 While Mr. Gingrich says he is not running for President in 1996, his statements on the subject are far from definitive. And he touched off a new round of speculation last week with the release of a full itinerary for a trip to New Hampshire next month. It is so crammed with events -- even moose hunting with Representative Bill Zeliff -- that the Speaker's advisers were considering chartering buses for a full-scale campaign-style motorcade around the state.
Mr. Thompson is far less subtle about his longing for the White House. He has already visited Iowa and New Hampshire and has more trips planned.
His aspirations were obvious this weekend at a regional meeting of Republicans in Green Bay, Wis., where he tried to upstage the Presidential candidates at the event by calling a news conference on Saturday afternoon and urging reporters not to count him out. "I haven't, certainly, foreclosed that option," Mr. Thompson said. But he cautioned reporters not to count him in, either, adding that he will make a decision by Labor Day.
It is said that every politician thinks he or she should be President, and Mr. Thompson is no exception. Delivering what might be the nucleus of a campaign speech, the Governor was not modest in making the case for why his record in three terms on welfare reform, taxes and job creation make him an obvious choice.
"All of the ideas that everybody's talking about are ideas that I've already done," he said. "Wisconsin is a microcosm of what everybody talks about in Washington, except we've done it. And I think that's a message that can resonate across the country." Noting that he has not served in Washington, he said, he would present himself as "the only candidate that's clearly from the outside." And he said he would emphasize economic issues rather than a social agenda.
Nor was Mr. Thompson bashful in recounting how the candidates are all making plays for him. "They all want an endorsement," he said.
The Governor, who is 53, seemed genuinely in a conflict about the Presidential action. One moment he would praise the contenders, and the next he would dismiss them as not matching his achievements. "None of the candidates have the record that I have," he said. "I may want to put that record out there."
But flirting with running for President is usually far more rewarding than actually running for President. Running means raising millions of dollars, putting yourself and your family under even deeper scrutiny and subjecting yourself to nasty attacks from fellow Republicans.
Then, of course, what if you lose? As successful as they may be in their current positions, it could be that Mr. Gingrich's negative ratings and Mr. Thompson's lack of name recognition, among other factors, would sink their candidacies.
Compounding the risk, the candidates who are already running have a head-start in organization and most have raised several million dollars. That is significant because with the compressed schedule of early primaries next year, the race could be over soon after it begins.
That is why some prominent Republicans think that Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Thompson will ultimately stay put. The Speaker, especially, may be positioning himself for a draft movement should the current contenders stumble.
But Mr. Thompson has considered all the angles: Spinning out a scenario of how he might win, he said Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, may not last as the front-runner. Even if Mr. Dole wins the early contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, he said, "The question is: Who comes in second? Who comes in third?" He acknowledged that he could not come close to his rivals' warchests but said that he could raise as much as $4 million by the end of the year.
Turning aside the conventional wisdom, Mr. Thompson said there may be such a divided field that "there's a good chance that this election could be decided on the convention floor, and wouldn't that be exciting?"
For all his plotting, there is someone on the sidelines who may scare Mr. Thompson off: Mr. Gingrich.
"Newt could come in here, and throw this whole election up for grabs," the Governor said. "Newt has an excellent chance to go right to the top."
Is Mr. Thompson maneuvering to be picked for Vice President? Perhaps. Don't count him in for the No. 2 spot, Mr. Thompson said. But, as his Republican fans in Wisconsin warn, don't count him out.

HEADLINE: Miracle in Mexico: A Clean Election

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: VICTORIA, Mexico

 BODY:
In the world that Vicente Fox would save, rivers are running dry, jobs are disappearing, and children's stomachs are hardening from their hunger. It goes almost without saying in the case Mr. Fox makes for his election as Governor of central Guanajuato state that corrupt governing-party politicians are growing fat on the taxpayers' pesos, but he rants about this anyway.
More striking is what Mr. Fox, a strapping, 52-year-old businessman, does not say: In town after town, speech after thundering speech, he never mentions the word "fraud." 
 Not quite four years ago, the protests Mr. Fox led after the state's last gubernatorial race established Guanajuato as a symbol of the anti-democratic ways of the party that has governed Mexico since 1929. In his quest for satisfaction, however, Mr. Fox now finds himself the comfortable frontrunner in what many political analysts say could be the fairest major election held in Mexico in decades.
Surprisingly effective campaign-spending regulations have limited the usual flood of resources to the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. A new state election law has the opposition virtually discounting the possibility of ballot-stuffing, repeat voting and other once standard practices at the polls.
With a member of Mr. Fox's right-of-center National Action Party serving as Guanajuato's interim Governor, the standard claims of favoritism by the incumbent are being made only by the PRI. "The dirty war" that dominates the headlines of local newspapers refers merely to the mundane business of what Americans know as negative campaigning.
"Things are very different from the last time," Mr. Fox said after a well-attended speech in Victoria, the sort of small farming town where he was all but ignored a few years ago. "I don't think it would be possible for them to get away with a fraud big enough to affect the outcome."
Even aides to President Ernesto Zedillo acknowledge that the conditions for Guanajuato's vote on May 28 remain exceptional. According to federal election officials and a leading election-monitoring group, PRI supporters in the southern state of Yucatan have continued to manipulate the rules and try to coerce the support of voters in another, much closer gubernatorial race there.
Yet the prospect of a clean vote and -- what is far more novel -- fair political competition in Guanajuato suggest that the opposition's growing strength in many states is pushing Mexico toward a more democratic political system even as opposition leaders and aides to Mr. Zedillo haggle over the terms for talks on what he promises will be "definitive" election reforms.
"What we are trying out here is going to be a lesson for the rest of the country," said Hugo Villalobos, 41, a hardware entrepreneur who leads Guanajuato's State Elections Council, an agency now controlled by a council of politically independent local dignitaries. "In Guanajuato, the 'definitive' reform has already taken place."
Six months into the economic crisis that began with Mr. Zedillo's disastrous devaluation of the peso, the brunt of the voters' anger at the PRI is being channeled in Guanajuato and Yucatan not by the leftist opposition that had long criticized the Government's economic policies but by the rightist opposition that had supported most of them.
Both states happen to be relative strongholds of the National Action Party, or PAN, which has governed some of their major cities for years. But the party's track record of relatively efficient, uncorrupt government may now be a lesser part of its candidates' appeal.
Despite leading by almost a two-to-one margin in most opinion polls, Mr. Fox insists that the PAN's interim Governor in Guanajuato, Carlos Medina, is almost as unpopular as the PRI: "He doesn't bring us votes," Mr. Fox said. "He costs us votes."
With many Mexicans growing more nervous about crime and political stability as well as about their jobs, Mr. Fox and his counterpart in Yucatan, Luis Correa, promise gradual change, smaller government, law and order. And in the purest populist tradition, Mr. Fox, especially, tantalizes the crowds with all kinds of things that he knows the next Governor might not have the money to to deliver.
To farmers who have been ruined by drought, he offers dams and canals to irrigate their land. To parents fed up with the decrepit education system, he pledges a computer in every school. Mexican and foreign companies will be wooed to a big, new industrial complex in the poorest reaches of the state, he says, and products will move back and forth on a four-lane highway.
Mr. Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who makes no secret of his hopes to seek the presidency in the year 2000, also vows to spend only one day out of every seven in the governor's office in the Guanajuato, the colonial state capital. "I am going to hire a governor," he said in an interview, smiling. "I'm going to be a politician."
His talent for political marketing was displayed after the August 1991 contest in which the State Elections Council, then dominated by the PRI, awarded a narrow victory to a candidate from that party's old guard, Ramon Aguirre. The lasting image of the campaign is of Mr. Fox, his eyes open wide, leading angry demonstrations with recovered stolen ballots.
With Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the President then, trying to prove himself a democrat to the United States Congress, which had just begun debating Mexico's possible inclusion in the North American Free Trade Agreement, officials in Mexico City forced Mr. Aguirre to resign before he could take office.
The election was the first of several in which Mr. Salinas quelled opposition protests of fraud in a politically expedient but not particularly democratic way. Mr. Salinas chose Mr. Medina, a rival of Mr. Fox's within the PAN, as interim Governor, then used his control of the federal Congress to push through a law that blocked Mr. Fox from running for President before the year 2000 because one of his parents was born abroad.
Mr. Medina has given Mr. Fox crucial help in presiding over the most advanced state election laws in Mexico.
The citizen-counselors of the State Elections Council quietly proved their independence last December, federal and state officials said, when four of its members threatened to resign in order to force out a fifth member aligned with the PRI.
For the first time in a gubernatorial election, poll workers will be able to compare photographs, signatures and fingerprints on the voter rolls to those on the voters' own identification cards. And though there is no formal auditing of campaign spending, both a study by the elections council and estimates by the PAN have indicated that PRI gubernatorial candidate, Ignacio Vazquez Torres, has so far held to the $2.3 million limit. (Mr. Fox said he had spent slightly less than half the $1.5 million that his PRI opponent was thought to have spent by early May.)
Notwithstanding a scandal last month in which supporters of Mr. Vazquez Torres were implicated in a stolen-car ring, the state elections tribunal has received only about a dozen minor reports reports of campaign malfeasance.
By comparison, reports released on May 18 by the election-monitoring group Civic Alliance documented vote-buying, coercion and a huge advantage in television and newspaper advertising by the PRI candidate for the governorship of Yucatan, Victor Cervera Pacheco, a stalwart of the party's old guard. The evidence was especially troubling, opposition officials said, because Mr. Cervera and his PAN challenger, Mr. Mena, have been neck-and-neck in the latest polls.
"Fraud is much more possible in Yucatan," Mr. Fox said. "I don't think it can really happen here."

An article on Monday about elections in the Mexican state of Guanajuato imprecisely summarized the views of Vicente Fox, an opposition candidate for governor. Although Mr. Fox did say that the record of the interim governor, Carlos Medina, a member of his own National Action Party, would cost him votes, he also said that the Institutional Revolutionary Party was even more unpopular with the voters.

HEADLINE: New Schools Seeking Small Miracles

SERIES: Multiple Choice: New York's Alternative Schools -- First article of a series

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON and JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
Once they were New York City's sturdy castles of learning, immense neighborhood high schools with as many as 5,000 students each that dependably churned out graduates to sustain the city and, sometimes, transform the world. Colin L. Powell went to Morris High School in the Bronx, Barbra Streisand and Bobby Fischer to Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn, Lewis Mumford to Stuyvesant in Manhattan.
But many of the city's 125 high schools are aging behemoths, seemingly incapable, as the dinosaurs, of adapting to a changing world. With teachers no longer commanding the authority they once did and with some parents unable to correct unruly or drifting children, too many large schools have become academically barren and violent places. 
 Two years ago, the New York City school system came up with a remedy that some say is its most radical change since its decentralization in 1969. And the initiative has moved forward even as major budget cuts have eliminated sports, art and music from many schools.
Forty-eight experimental small schools -- 46 of them high schools with enrollments of 110 to 600 students -- have been started by an unlikely alliance of neighborhood advocates seeking control of their schools, conservatives promoting school choice, educational pioneers eager to test theories and a teachers' union striving to give its members more say in their work lives.
"Our high schools were just too large, and there were a lot of problems with kids not feeling people even knew who they are," said Joseph A. Fernandez, the former Chancellor who set off the wave of small school development in 1992.
The current Chancellor, Ramon C. Cortines, has also supported the initiative, although his support is more tempered. He has warned that small schools are not a panacea and that the city's support for them must not hurt the large high schools, from Stuyvesant to Midwood, that function well and are still attended by a great majority of children.
Fifty more scaled-down schools, not only high schools but elementary and junior highs as well, will soon be on the drawing boards as a result of a $25 million award from the Annenberg Foundation.
The idea behind the new schools is disarmingly simple: Smaller is better.
Break up the impersonal school factory into intimate, more familial academies. Strip away the assistant principals and other layers of bureaucracy, reducing schools to the essentials: a teacher and a small group of students who can more easily know one another. Build teaching around a captivating theme -- building tunnels and bridges, museums, high finance, the environment, foreign languages, singing.
Similar experiments have been tried elsewhere -- and in New York City, two dozen "alternative" high schools for troubled students have sprouted sporadically since 1968. But nowhere has a city started so many small schools so fast and in such variety.
 
Effectiveness
Innovative? Yes. Better? Maybe.
 The big question, of course, is do these schools work?
That answer is distinctly uncertain. Most experimental schools have been operating for only a year or two, so the Board of Education has little data on academic performance. About all that board officials have concluded is that students attend classes more consistently and that these schools are less violent.
"Some of the small schools are just outstanding," said Mr. Cortines. "Others, there's not much education going on, though they're working to make it happen."
Over the last six months, reporters from The New York Times visited 50 of the new schools and, for contrast, 10 of the older alternative schools. They found that some new schools -- like Kingsborough Academy for the Sciences in Brooklyn -- are blossoming, some are just putting down roots and others have been uprooted repeatedly and are struggling. Many have inexperienced supervisors and teachers who are still grappling with fundamentals, while others have attracted seasoned professional staffs.
Kingsborough Academy has had a robust beginning because it has been paired with Kingsborough Community College in the Manhattan Beach section of Brooklyn, and has access to lectures by the college's science professors as well as its gym and laboratories. Its academically challenging program is so popular that it received 4,000 applications for 180 spots.
Yet Vanguard High School, founded in 1993, camped in four different buildings before moving into a permanent home on the Upper East Side in March. The Leadership School on the Lower East Side shares a building with a junior high where discipline is so bad that students regularly run through halls and occasionally light the bulletin boards on fire. One Bronx school devoted to foreign languages started all its students on Japanese and switched to Russian the next year, only to return to Japanese.
Some critics, including Diane S. Ravitch, a former assistant United States secretary of education, and Hanna Rosin, writing in The New Republic, have voiced concerns that classes at several small schools devoted to the study of social justice can border on indoctrination.
Because of their size, the schools' curriculum is limited -- nothing like the palette of sciences at Midwood High in Brooklyn or the seven languages offered at Edward R. Murrow in Brooklyn -- and many courses seem to be still in development.
Monroe Academy for Business and Law, for instance, has no legal courses yet. For next year, the school has readied a course called Street Law, which the principal, Judith Miller, said would teach students "things you need to know to be a citizen, like how to navigate the legal system, how to go to Small Claims Court, things like that."
Almost everywhere, principals of traditional high schools remain skeptical, pointing out that most of the new schools are not trying to qualify their students for the statewide Regents examinations, as comprehensive high schools must do.
"Smaller schools make it possible for kids and teachers to know each other," said Saul Bruckner, Murrow's principal since 1974. "But it's not easy developing a theme school and still providing the fundamentals."
Yet, at many schools, including those founded and run by teachers, staff members find they relish the chance they now have to discuss teaching and to draw on one another's experiences and perspectives.
"Children do want to learn, they do want to make a difference, and so do teachers," said Maura Malarcher, 33, a former volunteer in Indonesia who teaches at the 129-student Renaissance School in Queens. "But so many teachers walk around with 500-pound weights on their back. They have to file a big request just to make a Xerox of something. Here you finally have a sense of ownership as a teacher."
 
Changes
New Themes And Less Testing
 At these boutique schools, incubating in basements of school buildings, churches and neighborhood centers from the northern Bronx to the Rockaways, the bell does not ring every 43 minutes and students do not have three minutes to get to the next class.
At some schools, classes are two hours long and teachers, blessed with only 14 or 15 students, have time to consider a child's math difficulty or to console an adolescent enduring a family crisis.
In many classrooms, students can eat popcorn or chew gum, listen to music through headphones and call teachers by their first names. At Frederick Douglass Academy in Harlem, though, students in uniforms line up for class in silent rows.
Many are trying exciting, often unorthodox lessons. Students at the Museum School in Manhattan recently surveyed the mammal collection at the American Museum of Natural History and wrote essays on the ethics of collecting specimens. The High School for Economics and Finance, in lower Manhattan, taught a course in capitalist finance: "Welcome to Wall Street." Students at the School for the Physical City, in Chelsea, went 750 feet under Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx to view a water tunnel.
Within many new schools, there has been a radical break with the traditional disciplines. In science, for instance, high school students have for decades been taught in yearlong sequential courses -- earth science, biology, chemistry and physics. Some new schools, like the Science Skills Center High School in downtown Brooklyn, still present this curriculum.
But teachers in the experimental movement felt that subjects taught in isolation were quickly forgotten; instead, they offered courses focused on broad themes and projects. In a course whose theme is water, classes may be taught some biology as they study fish, chemistry as they look at river pollution and a smattering of physics as they examine ocean currents.
Driving these schools is the theory that students learn more by directing their own research than by scribbling lecture notes. Blackboard teaching brought results when America was shaping a labor force for the industrial era, the movement's champions argue, but schools must prepare students differently for the more initiative-driven workplace of the information age.
Students may learn a basic concept of geometry like the Pythagorean theorem only if a teacher decides they need to know how to measure the angles of a triangle to complete an assigned project, like designing a model roller-coaster. Otherwise, a student may never hear of the theorem.
Board of Education officials have no way to monitor what concepts are being taught to which students when. Many experimental school directors criticize traditional tests. Students at only 13 of the 30 new high schools that opened in 1993 took even one state Regents test in 1993-1994.
"I was very unhappy," said Martha R. Sutphen, an English teacher who taught at Manhattan Village Academy on the East Side for a year before returning to a more traditional school. "You'd say, 'Take out your books,' and they'd say: 'Why? You don't give us tests; why should we take out our books?' "
And students at the new schools may be taking even fewer tests: the schools are trying to persuade the State Education Department to grant waivers from Regents competency examinations, which all high school students must pass in order to graduate. Instead, many new schools are developing graduation requirements that involve teacher committees' reviews of students' work.
Some educational leaders are criticizing the abandonment of traditional disciplines and tests. "We find students' access to these disciplinary tools to be an indispensable ingredient of quality education," Howard Gardner, a Harvard University professor, wrote in an article last winter he co-authored with an assistant, Veronica Boix-Mansilla. "Shorn of disciplines we become intellectual barbarians."
These small schools must also confront the reality that some colossal high schools do work, offering a cornucopia of courses in an orderly atmosphere and graduating many students with academically taxing Regents diplomas. At Brooklyn high schools like Midwood or John Dewey or at a Queens school like Benjamin N. Cardozo, a combination of effective principals, a close-knit staff, ambitious students and engaging programs still makes for the kind of schooling most New Yorkers over 50 took for granted.
The new schools, however, have begun to recast a few of the most troubled old ones.
Hoary bastions like James Monroe in the Soundview section of the Bronx and Julia Richman on the Upper East Side in Manhattan have been broken up into six distinct schools. Andrew Jackson in Cambria Heights, Queens, is now four schools.
Although Thomas Jefferson in East New York, Brooklyn, and Bushwick High School still carry on, some of their students are being siphoned off by two new schools run by East Brooklyn Congregations, a clergy and neighborhood group whose forte has been building affordable housing.
A common criticism of the new schools is that they are recruiting the highest-achieving children through interviews. While some student bodies are especially talented, at most new schools the accusation of "creaming" appears to be false. About two dozen new schools act like any other neighborhood school, taking students within a district or zone, first come, first served. Most of their students are very low-achieving. Other schools, like the Choir Academy of Harlem, affiliated with the Harlem Boys Choir, use selective admissions.
A computer study of ethnic composition shows that the schools are about as integrated, ethnically, as the rest of the system. At the most segregated new school, the Choir Academy, 92 percent of the students are black. Eight traditional high schools have a higher concentration of black students.
Anthony Alvarado, who sponsored experimental schools over two decades as a superintendent in East Harlem and in lower Manhattan, said of the movement: "There are warts everywhere -- warts in the pedagogy, warts in the staffing, warts on the leadership." But he added: "The small schools have much to teach the rest of the system about knowing children well, and this isn't just touchy-feely stuff. It creates the potential for much more powerful teaching."
 
Politics
Powerful Support Is Fueled by Hope
 It is violence that set off the experiment. Former Chancellor Fernandez authorized several dozen new schools after a 15-year-old shot two fellow students to death in Thomas Jefferson High in Brooklyn in February 1992. He also used the program to address political pressures to create small community-controlled high schools.
For help in designing safer schools, Mr. Fernandez turned to an odd alliance. It included the Fund for New York City Public Education, a private group that channels corporate funds to public schools; Deborah Meier, who founded an East Harlem school in 1985; the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group; Acorn, a community organization of low-income residents in three boroughs, and East Brooklyn Congregations.
Besides financing from City Hall and the Board of Education, the Annenberg Foundation donated $25 million in September to a coalition that includes the Fund, the Manhattan Institute, Acorn and Ms. Meier's network, the Center for Collaborative Education. It has become fashionable for corporations and philanthropies to adopt an individual school or a nonprofit organization that has helped found schools.
Teachers' union leaders, hopeful the changes can invigorate not only schools but teachers as well, pioneered contract changes -- new in the nation -- that have allowed the new schools to bypass sacrosanct seniority rules in selecting staff.
So far, the new schools are more expensive than other schools, but this is because each is to receive $800,000 in startup money for desks, computers and other equipment, said John J. Ferrandino, the board's chief superintendent for high schools.
The city has spent more than $120 million to build classrooms in leased offices and factories for 22 new schools, at about $10,000 a seat, said Robert Buxbaum, director of the board's facilities division. By contrast, the most recently built high school, Stuyvesant in Manhattan, cost $54,000 a seat.
After City Hall cut the board's long-term construction budget last fall, Mr. Cortines barred the building of any more small schools. He has urged the recipients of the Annenberg grant to divide troubled large schools into small new ones, keeping them in their own buildings to save money.
Robert Berne, dean of New York University's Robert F. Wagner Jr. School of Public Service, who is studying the new schools' finances, contended that any analysis must consider how many students graduate. And by that criteria, he said, they may prove to be cheaper than large schools.
"Most analyses of school cost look at cost per student," Dr. Berne said. "But the real issue is cost per graduate, because these schools may be more successful at educating students."
By 2000, these schools will seat only 50,000 students -- a tiny fraction of the city's projected 1.3 million schoolchildren. Still, hope is strong that these schools can reverse a long cycle of threadbare results.
"These schools work," said Michelle Fine, a social psychologist at the CUNY Graduate Center. "Violence is down; parent involvement is up. And they are holding on to kids with very troubled histories."

An italic note at the end of an article yesterday about experimental small schools in New York City misstated the name of a school being profiled today as part of the same series. It is El Puente Academy for Peace and Justice, not El Puente Academy for Peace and Freedom.
PUB-DATE: June 1, 1995
An article on May 22 about New York City's small experimental schools referred incorrectly to a comment by the Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner about "an indispensable ingredient of quality education." Mr. Gardner was defending traditional disciplines like science and history. He was not also defending standardized tests; he opposes them.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Obtains a Delay On a Shift in Bond Ratings

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
After an unusual last-minute joint plea from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and leaders of the City Council, a major bond-rating agency agreed yesterday to hold off a possible downgrade of the city's bond rating, at least until after the city and state budgets are settled.
Since late last week, city officials have said that New York City's general obligation bonds were in imminent danger of being downgraded from their current A- level -- an action that would be a major embarrassment for the Mayor -- because of the city's difficulty in closing its $3.1 billion budget gap. 
 But yesterday, Richard Larkin, a managing director of the Standard & Poor's Corporation, said the Mayor and other city officials had made a convincing argument to the rating agency that any change in the bond rating should come only after final agreement was reached on the city and state budgets. He said Standard & Poor's would keep the city's bonds on what is called negative credit watch, a warning level that the city received in January.
Mr. Larkin said the negative credit watch demonstrates that the agency continues to have serious concerns about holes in the city budget, and would continue to discuss those concerns with city officials in the weeks to come.
The agency's decision was at least a temporary relief for the Mayor, who ran on a platform of restoring order to the city's fiscal accounts and who has proposed two straight years of drastically reduced budgets. A downgrade, in essence, would be a signal of no confidence in Mr. Giuliani's fiscal policies from financial institutions. A statement by the rating firm that the city's bonds were considered a more risky investment could force the city to pay more interest to sell its bonds on the open market.
The Mayor said yesterday that the decision by Standard & Poor's was a "very helpful, very useful step." He said the administration had finally persuaded the agency that his budget plans would eventually slash the city's structural deficit.
But that view contrasted sharply with the gloomy appraisal that Standard & Poor's officials offered today. They said they were still not convinced that the city was headed in the right direction.
"This is not good news for the city," Mr. Larkin said. "We're only waiting until we've seen the whole puzzle."
To avert the political blow of a downgrade, the Mayor has held three meetings with Standard & Poor's officials in recent weeks, two in the last four days. The final meeting, which took place yesterday morning, was particularly remarkable by City Hall standards because Mr. Giuliani took with him two leaders of the City Council. The Mayor and the Council leadership are frequently at odds over budgetary matters, and the joint presentation underscored the importance to the city of preserving its bond rating.
Joining the Mayor in the hourlong meeting with the rating agency were Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker; Herbert E. Berman, chairman of the Council's Finance Committee, and City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, along with staff members. City officials said that by taking the unusual step of adding Council members to the coalition, the Mayor was trying to demonstrate unanimity on the request, even though the two wings of City Hall are deeply divided on how the budget should be cut.
Mr. Vallone said that if not for yesterday's meeting, the agency would have downgraded the city's credit rating. He said that he strongly urged the agency not to do so and that he remains in disagreement with its decision to continue a negative credit watch.
"I don't think they fully understand how committed everyone is to making sure New York City is not a spendthrift city," he said. "Their only job is to tell people how risky our bonds are. Why would anyone be afraid to buy New York City bonds? They're the safest paper on earth."
Both Mr. Vallone and Mr. Giuliani stressed that they were equally committed to balancing the budget, disagreeing only over which services should be cut.
"Although we have differences in how we allocate reductions," the Mayor said, "we don't have a difference in the scope of the problem."
But now that the rating agency has agreed to wait for a final city budget before taking action, the Mayor and the Council are under even more pressure to close the huge gap without resorting to budget gimmicks used in previous years, techniques that would be likely to produce an immediate downgrade.
Mr. Larkin said Standard & Poor's still had strong doubts about several aspects of the Mayor's plans to close the budget gap. Nearly a billion dollars in the Mayor's program depends on assistance from the state, and leaders in Albany have said the city will be lucky to get even half of its request. The city is also counting on $600 million in labor savings that have yet to be negotiated with municipal unions, along with pension fund changes and agency spending cuts still to be worked out with the City Council.
Raymond D. Horton, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business group, said a downgrade would have little practical effect on the city's finances because the city's bonds are already trading at a low level, as if they had been downgraded.
The real embarrassment of a downgrade would be in casting the city's credit rating near the lowest levels of major cities. If Standard & Poor's had downgraded, Mr. Larkin said, the rating would probably have fallen to BBB+. That is slightly more favorable than the rating of Philadelphia, now at BBB; of Detroit, now at BBB-, and of Washington, which is the worst in the country, at B.

HEADLINE: Budget Dispute Erupts Over Loans and Grants to Businesses

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 22

 BODY:
A new dispute emerged today in negotiations over the state budget, now 52 days late, over whether the State Commissioner of Economic Development should be given greater discretion in giving out tens of millions of dollars in low-interest loans and grants to businesses.
The issue is more about politics than money. The Commissioner, Charles A. Gargano, was campaign finance chairman last year for Gov. George E. Pataki, directing the drive that raised more than $14 million for the Republican candidate. Democrats now suggest that Mr. Gargano is planning to use his new post to reward loyal Republicans and pressure contributors to finance future Republican candidates. 
 Following a midafternoon negotiating session, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, called Mr. Gargano a "political operative" who controls a $142 million "slush fund." He said Governor Pataki had proposed lifting spending guidelines, reporting requirements and other restrictions traditionally imposed by the Legislature on this money, which is earmarked for business-development projects.
"I'm not giving a political operative of the Governor unfettered discretion as to how to spend a significant amount of money in this state," Mr. Silver said, noting that Mr. Gargano had recently appeared with Republican political officials before groups of potential campaign contributors.
But Mr. Gargano said that Mr. Pataki was only trying to remove costly restrictions that his Democratic predecessor, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, also opposed. He said he had not been involved in political fund raising activity recently.
"Was I a political operative during the campaign? Absolutely," Mr. Gargano said in an interview. "Am I one now? Absolutely not."
This is not the first time Mr. Silver has tried to use Mr. Gargano as an example of cronyism in the Pataki administration. In March, the Speaker criticized Mr. Gargano for planning to move some of his department's offices to a midtown Manhattan office condominium that Mr. Silver described as luxurious and frivolous.
The dispute comes as Mr. Pataki, Mr. Silver and the third member of the Albany power triumvirate, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, Republican of Rensselaer County, are struggling to complete marathon negotiations over the budget.
Though the three leaders said a final agreement was possible this week, they said they remained apart on key issues including health care, education and criminal justice.
In particular, Mr. Pataki and the leaders were at an impasse over a proposal to soften penalties against nonviolent repeat felons, mostly low-level drug dealers, while also lengthening the sentences of violent offenders.
Though all three sides in the budget debate have agreed in concept to the plan, they have disagreed sharply over alternative programs for the nonviolent repeat offenders. Mr. Pataki and Senate Republicans have recommended converting two state psychiatric centers in upstate communities into drug treatment centers for nonviolent, drug-addicted criminals.
But Mr. Silver suggested that those programs were simply a form of pork-barrel spending for Republican districts and said he would like to see alternative programs in other places, though he would not specify where.
Senator Michael F. Nozzolio, a leading proponent of converting the state psychiatric centers, one of which is in his district, said Mr. Silver is advocating a "lax approach" to drug treatment.
"They are suggesting something that does not have appropriate correctional oversight," Mr. Nozzolio, a Republican from Seneca Falls, said. "They are suggesting something where we would lose control."

HEADLINE: Congress Move on Cuba Irks Canada and Mexico

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: TORONTO, May 22

 BODY:
Canada and Mexico have joined forces to defeat proposed American legislation that would tighten the 33-year-old trade embargo against Cuba.
The extra-territorial reach of the bill, which penalizes countries that have commercial ties with Cuba, has brought the protests of the two North American Free Trade Association partners and their unusual cooperation in Washington. 
 In separate letters to members of Congress, the Canadian Ambassador to the United States, Raymond Chretien, nephew of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, and the Mexican Ambassador, Jesus Silva-Herzog, say the measure seeks to regulate what their countries can and cannot do, and they warn of almost certain retaliation.
Concern is so great in Canada that an all-party delegation of members of Parliament is about to take arguments against the bill directly to the halls of Congress.
"We're going to explain how this bill interferes with our sovereignty," said Paul Zed, chairman of the Standing Committee on Industry of the House of Commons.
"It irks a lot of us in Canada, and we're not going to take it lying down," said Mr. Zed, a New Brunswick Liberal who heads the delegation jointly with Bill Graham, a Toronto Liberal who is chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Commons.
The bill, which has strong backing in both houses of Congress, is sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who heads the Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative Dan Burton, the Indiana Republican who heads the the House Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs.
Canada and Mexico mainly object to provisions that ban the import of sugar, syrups and molasses from any country that buys these products from Cuba, prohibit American foreign subsidiaries from having any financial dealings with Cuba, and deny entry into the United States of foreign citizens deemed to have had dealings involving property in Cuba expropriated from Americans.
The Globe and Mail has observed tartly that Canadian executives would enter the same prohibited category as political militants and convicted felons.
Sherritt Inc., a Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, mining company that recently started producing nickel in Cuba, and Delta Hotels and Resorts, with its nine Cuban properties, are among Canadian companies that could be hit by sanctions in the Helms-Burton bill.
Canada and Mexico say the legislation violates undertakings of the United States under both the free trade agreement and the new World Trade Organization.
Beyond the adverse effects on political, trade and economic relations, Ambassador Chretien grumbled, the bill "would undermine the integrity of an international legal system which serves both our countries."
By trying to force trade partners to squeeze Cuba, the bill sets up a secondary boycott, Canada and Mexico argue. But it has long been illegal in the United States for union members to act against an employer to get it to bring pressure on another company. And in international relations the United States has traditionally opposed secondary boycott situations, like Arab pressure on third countries to isolate Israel.
In the Central American-Caribbean region, Cuba is Canada's second largest trading partner after Puerto Rico. Two-way trade was around $220 million last year, with imports and exports almost in balance. Canada chiefly exports food products and imports nickel and sugar.
Mexico's two-way trade was somewhat smaller at $161 million. Mexico imported only $11 million, mainly rum and tobacco. Exports of $150 million included oil and chemical products and detergents and soap. With its own sugar crop, Mexico has not bought sugar from Cuba since 1990.
But the sugar import prohibition raises serious concerns for Canada, which annually exports $500 million worth of products containing sugar to the United States. Much of this commerce is from American-owned subsidiaries like Kraft Canada Inc., which employs 460 in Cobourg, Ontario, and makes cereals and other packaged foods containing sugar. Canada imports about $400 million of American products containing sugar.
So, Canadian officials point out, trade hostilities over Cuba could erase nearly $1 billion of bilateral trade and the thousands of jobs it generates.
"We're not challenging the right of the U.S. to impose an embargo," said Bruno Picard, an aide to the Canadian Trade Minister, Roy MacLaren. "We share similar goals regarding democracy in Cuba and a market-oriented economy. But we disagree on the means to get there. We favor more engagement and dialogue, rather than a boycott."

HEADLINE: Christopher Urging Clinton to Veto a Bill to Cut Foreign Aid

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today that he was urging President Clinton to veto a bill in the House of Representatives that would cut foreign aid and eliminate three foreign affairs agencies.
Mr. Christopher, who has spent much of his time during the last several months trying to persuade Congress to leave the foreign affairs budget and agencies alone, said the bill would undermine American leadership in the world and encroach on the President's authority to make foreign policy. 
 In a speech to the Council of the Americas, an association that promotes United States-Latin American relations, Mr. Christopher sounded exasperated about a bill approved last week by the House International Relations Committee that would cut foreign aid by 15 percent during the next two years and abolish the Agency for International Development, the United States Information Agency and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. The full House is scheduled to vote on the bill this week.
The bill would also reverse the Administration's new policy of sending boat people back to Cuba, would cut off aid to Russia if it sells nuclear reactors to Iran, and would require the appointment of a special envoy to Tibet, a move that would enrage China.
Mr. Christopher, who in the past has pursued a cooperative approach toward Congress, spoke with a harsh tone today, saying the bill "wages an extraordinary assault on the President's constitutional authority to manage foreign policy."
His remarks come after many Administration officials acknowledged that they have done too little and acted too late to blunt the Republican offensive to cut the $15 billion foreign aid budget and to restructure the foreign affairs agencies.
One official said Mr. Christopher's remarks are intended in part to persuade Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who heads the Foreign Relations Committee, to negotiate with the Administration on amending bills he is sponsoring that would also reduce foreign aid and abolish the three agencies.
The aide said Mr. Christopher also hoped that his speech might persuade the full House to amend its State Department authorization bill by raising the levels of foreign aid and deleting provisions that conflict with Administration policy on Cuba and Tibet.
Mr. Christopher has sent President Clinton a letter recommending a veto, and the White House has sent a statement to the House saying that Mr. Christopher, Defense Secretary William Perry and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin will recommend a veto if the bill is presented to the President.
White House officials said that the President shares Mr. Christopher's concerns, but that he wants to see the final bill before deciding whether to veto it.
"Under the cover of budget-cutting, back-door isolationists on the left and the right want to cut the legs off of our leadership," President Clinton said in a recent speech. "We did not win the cold war to walk away and blow the peace on foolish, penny-wise-pound-foolish budgeting."
The Administration's campaign to save foreign aid has stirred little enthusiasm in Congress, partly because overseas aid is, according to many polls, the least popular part of the $1.5 trillion Federal budget.
Yet foreign aid represents just 1 percent of the budget. In campaigning for the aid, the White House often notes that the United States ranks last among 22 major industrial countries in terms of spending on foreign aid as a percentage of its gross domestic product.
Senator Helms and many other Republicans assert that foreign aid has often been squandered on poor nations that have little to show for it despite receiving millions of dollars. Those Republicans contend that, with balancing the budget a priority, the Government can achieve significant savings by cutting foreign aid and eliminating the three foreign policy agencies.
At his daily news briefing, Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman, criticized both the seven-year budget outline approved by the House and the balanced-budget proposal put forward by the Senate Budget Committee. The two together would reduce foreign aid by more than 35 percent.
"They're simply too low to meet the minimum requirements that this country needs as a global power to meet its interests," Mr. Burns said.
At a Senate hearing last week, Mr. Christopher called those budget bills "irresponsible," saying they would force the United States to close many embassies and abandon its policy of having an embassy in every country.
"We cannot support our nation's foreign policy on the cheap," he said. "We cannot protect our interests as the world's most powerful nation if we do not marshal the resources to stand by our commitments."

Trade Dispute Between U.S. and Japan Moves to Paris

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 22

 BODY:
The United States and Japan brought their bitter trade dispute to the European Continent today, with senior representatives from both sides accusing each other of using misleading figures on Japanese imports of American autos.
A day before the annual ministerial meeting here of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- which brings together the foreign, trade and finance ministers of 25 of the wealthiest nations -- Japan's representative to the European Union, Tomohiko Kobayashi, exchanged strong words at a news conference with the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor. 
 Mr. Kantor said the Japanese were trying to confuse the public with their own numbers and present a distorted picture of the realities of their car market. "You are trying to confuse our friends," he said.
Afterward, Mr. Kobayashi asserted that Washington's threatened trade clash with Japan ran the risk of eroding pro-American sentiment in Tokyo and could lead to worsening relations between the two trade superpowers. "There's a very rapid decrease in sympathy for the U.S.," Mr. Kobayashi said.
The barbed exchange was the latest skirmish to follow the United States' decision nearly a week ago to impose 100 percent tariffs on imported Japanese luxury cars after representatives of the two sides failed to reach agreement in talks to open Japan's markets for American-made cars and parts.
The dispute has placed the O.E.C.D.'s meeting under a cloud, overshadowing its semiannual economic forecast, which showed growth slowing, over all, in its 25 countries.
At the Royal Monceau Hotel here in the stylish 8th arrondissement of Paris, not far down a broad road from the Arc de Triomphe, Japanese officials were setting up their own version of a trade war room. Scores of these officials occupied offices on three floors, for the Trade, Economic and Foreign ministries, giving extensive interviews and having early meetings with their counterparts in the O.E.C.D. The purpose was to make sure that Japan's analysis of its auto market would be widely circulated.
Among the early discussions, Japanese representatives talked with Mexican officials, hoping to win their support and apply pressure on the United States from a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"The Japanese car market is not well understood," said Yoshihiro Sakamoto, a vice minister in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. "There has been a lack of effort by American car companies to penetrate the Japanese car market."
Mr. Sakamoto said that contrary to assertions by the United States, Japan's market was open and the United States' problem was simply that its auto makers had not done a good job in penetrating the mass market, particularly compact and subcompact cars with engines smaller than 2 liters. He noted that 80 percent of the Japanese car market consisted of such small cars and argued that no Big Three auto maker offering American-made autos in Japan of that size. American officials say they are trying to sell 51 models of such cars in Japan.
The Japanese have come here ready to argue. They have brought the International Trade Ministry's ranking automobile expert, Atsushi Oi, to rebut numbers used by Mr. Kantor and his aides.
Mr. Oi contends that in the big-car market -- cars with engines larger than 3 liters -- the Americans have done well selling to Japanese, capturing 28.4 percent of the market. But that market accounts for less than 3 percent of the 6.5 million cars sold in Japan each year.
Last Tuesday, the United States said it would enforce 100 percent tariffs on 13 luxury cars from Japan with annual import value of $6 billion, unless an agreement on the Japanese auto market could be reached by June 28.
In many previous disputes, Japan has yielded at the 11th hour, but its hard stand in the last few days has made many here doubt that it will accommodate Washington's strong-arm tactics. For example, Japanese officials have repeatedly said they would take part in no more joint talks with Washington on car imports until the United States removed the threat of sanctions. Otherwise, Mr. Sakamoto reiterated today, Tokyo would take its case to the World Trade Organization.
The O.E.C.D. said in its economic report that it had lowered its overall growth forecast because of lower-than-expected growth in Japan.
It estimated the overall increase for its 25 nations at 2.7 percent this year and next, after adjusting for inflation. In December, the group forecast growth at 3 percent in 1995 and 2.9 percent in 1996.
The organization cut its estimate for Japan's growth almost in half, to 1.3 percent from 2.5 percent.
One of the chief reasons for the slowdown was an overly strong Japanese yen, which makes Japanese exports more expensive, reducing demand for them.

Clinton's Aid To Industry Is A G.O.P. Target

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
Buried among the Republicans' sharp cost-cutting proposals to balance the Federal budget is the swift dismantling of two of the Clinton Administration's most prominent economic innovations: the use of the Government to promote exports and the underwriting of new technologies that corporate America considers too risky.
During his Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton briefly called those strategies "industrial policy," until Republicans seized on the phrase as proof that Mr. Clinton wanted the Government to meddle in the workings of the market. Once in office, the White House dropped the terminology but went ahead anyway with an aggressive program, declaring that the United States needed to develop partnerships with industry and use Government pressure to promote exports, two skills that Japan and Germany turned into an art after World War II. 
 The Republican budget proposals would bring many of those efforts to a halt and drastically shrink others, from the Energy Department to the Pentagon. The most sweeping cutback proposal, the "The Department of Commerce Dismantling Act," is scheduled to be introduced on Tuesday by House Republicans. The act would immediately terminate six of the Cabinet department's offices and slice up the organization that provides the skills for trade negotiations with Japan, China and several other nations.
Many functions of the Commerce Department's highest-profile organization, the International Trade Administration, would be carved up or eliminated. It is unclear what would happen to the economic "war room" that calls in ambassadors, Cabinet secretaries and sometimes the President to put pressure on foreign governments to buy American goods.
Curiously, the White House has said almost nothing in public about the attack on the core of its economic strategy, partly for fear that it would detract from its warnings about proposed cuts to Medicare and other popular social programs.
"We've talked through what is the best approach, and the decision was to stay focused on the programs that most people understand," said Hazel R. O'Leary, the Secretary of Energy, whose department's budget would shrink by roughly $7 billion over the next five years.
"It's a little early," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the National Economic Council, an office that was created at the start of the Administration to give economics equal weight with issues of national security. "There should be a good debate about the wisdom of this, but it is still early in the budget process."
It may be early, but it seems clear that most of the trade and technology promotion programs will be sharply reduced, if they survive at all.
As a result, the White House's reticence has not kept the departments themselves from starting all-out survival campaigns. Capitol Hill these days is flooded with under secretaries and assistant secretaries explaining and justifying programs that have never before come under intense scrutiny.
Many of those programs were started under Republican administrations. The theme of the presentations often boils down to one argument: In an age of economic conflict, cutting out political and economic support for industry is the equivalent of unilateral disarmament.
"Our global competitors are laughing at us," Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown said today in a telephone conversation from Paris, where he is attending a meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. "Just at the moment when we've finally learned that there is no way to win without a public-private partnership, without getting the Government involved in promoting a nation's exports, people are incredulous that Congress would be doing this.
"The French are apoplectic that we have been so pro-active and successful," Mr. Brown said, a reference to Washington's role in winning a huge contract in Brazil last year over French competition. "And now they are delighted that we are thinking about not doing it anymore."
The Republican theory is that the Commerce Department has become a brazen example of "corporate welfare," a term coined by one of Mr. Clinton's Cabinet members and close friends, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich. To the White House's horror, the phrase -- which Mr. Reich has not repeated since -- has become a rallying call for the freshman class of Republicans, who do not share their party's traditional closeness or dependence on big business.
"There are 19 different departments in the Government that deal with trade," said Representative Dick Chrysler, the Michigan Republican who drafted the legislation to dismantle the Commerce Department 92 years after its creation. "They could all be reduced to a single Department of Trade."
Another target of Mr. Chrysler's is the department's Advanced Technology Program, which provides backing for technologies that small companies -- and some large ones -- consider promising but too risky to attempt. "This has grown from $10 million in 1990 to $250 million in 1993, and now they want $750 million," Mr. Chrysler said. "This is nothing other than picking winners and losers."
Such arguments underscore the sharp difference in the way technology and trade policy is dealt with in Washington and in the capitals of its major economic competitors, where trade is considered national security and "picking winners and losers" is a phrase with no political resonance.
In Japan and Germany, there is virtually no debate over government programs to provide seed money for risky technologies or to use the influence of top officials to win contracts. It is taken as a given that such roles fall to the central government, along with defending the nation's territory and making foreign policy.
In Japan, for example, officials will freely acknowledge that more than 50 percent of the money committed to new technologies will result in utter failure. But even a 20 percent success rate, they argue, should be considered a success. No one would even attempt such an argument in Washington.
"You can't go up on the Hill and talk about a 40 percent success rate, even if that is a brilliant performance," Ms. O'Leary said last week. "People will say: 'What? We are throwing away 60 percent?"
Instead, Ms. O'Leary's department has been churning out news releases about its industrial breakthroughs in energy conservation. A giant sulfur lamp now hangs over the Energy Department's entrance on Constitution Avenue, a single light that replaces 250 bulbs. "It was developed with $1 million in Government money and much more in private funds," she said. "That is hardly a waste."
On the Hill, though, no one wants to talk about sulfur lamps, unless they are designed to illuminate a balanced budget. "This is the tail-wagging-the-dog syndrome," Mr. Chrysler said. "If it is a good invention, let the private sector invent it."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japan's Auto Makers Feel Bite of U.S. Tariff

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, May 23

 BODY:
The high tariff imposed by the Clinton Administration on Japanese luxury cars imported into the United States has begun to bite, forcing Japanese companies to suspend exports and cut production.
The Mazda Motor Corporation and the Honda Motor Company said today that they had temporarily halted exports to the United States of the models that would be subject to the 100 percent tariff. 
 The Nissan Motor Corporation said it was considering cutting its production and exports of the affected cars starting in June.
The Administration imposed the 100 percent tariff on 13 Japanese luxury car models after the United States and Japan failed to reach an agreement aimed at increasing sales of American automobiles and parts in Japan. The tariff, which will affect American-bound exports valued at $5.9 billion annually, will formally take effect on June 28, but it is to be applied retroactively to last Saturday.
Luxury-car exports, while small in number, are very profitable for the Japanese companies. As the yen has risen, auto makers have shifted production of less expensive cars overseas, leaving only expensive cars that can be made profitably in Japan.
The Clinton Administration is counting on the sanctions to break the resistance of the Japanese companies to developing voluntary plans for increasing their purchases of foreign automobile parts.
The companies still say they will not back down, but auto executives are expressing doubts about the hard line taken by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in the negotiations with the United States.
The companies can ill afford more cutbacks in production because domestic sales and exports have been declining for a few years, leaving a huge overcapacity in Japan.
Because of the high yen, Mazda, which has reported big losses, has already cut in half its exports of all cars to the United States, to about 10,000 vehicles for the quarter from April to June. Its two luxury models subject to the sanctions, the 929 and Millenia, account for about 20 to 25 percent of those exports, or as few as 1,000 cars a month.
Nissan, the second-largest auto company behind the Toyota Motor Corporation, makes 5,000 or so a month of the three Infiniti models subject to the tariff. A spokesman said the company had a 60-day supply in the United States.
Honda said it had stopped exporting its Acura Legend to the United States as of last weekend and was considering reducing production of the vehicle, but had not made a final decision.
Toyota, the largest and financially strongest Japanese auto maker, said it was continuing to ship its Lexus luxury vehicles. A spokesman said the company wanted to keep supporting its American dealers and was hopeful that in the end the sanctions would not be imposed.
Mitsubishi Motors, which is in a somewhat better position, is continuing to ship its Diamante to the United States. The Diamante that is subject to the tariff is in the last stages of its model life. The new model is expected to be produced in Australia, which might allow the company to export to the United States and avoid the tariff.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices for Bonds End Mixed Ahead of Fed Policy Session

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday in thin trading in advance of today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee and this week's auctions of new Treasury securities.
The 30-year bond rose 1/32 , to a price of 10829/32for a yield of 6.91 percent, down from 6.92 percent on Friday, while bills of shorter maturity were a bit weaker. Bills with maturities ranging from three months to one year rose as much as 3 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 Though the Open Market Committee is the Fed's policy-making arm, few market participants expect it to make any shift in short-term interest rates at this session. Eric Hamilton, a senior fixed-income analyst with the Technical Data Corporation in Boston, said the market was just plodding along yesterday, with many market participants already looking ahead to the three-day holiday weekend.
With stocks on the rebound yesterday, some investors who retreated to the shelter of credit markets last week may have moved back into equities, he noted. Also, traders said that there was some downward pressure on Treasury securities from the issuance of more corporate debt, which competes with the Treasury market for investor cash, as well as from the $75 billion of new Treasury securities to be sold this week.
"Demand does not show overwhelming retail interest right now, at least not as strong as it normally would be," Mr. Hamilton said, adding, "The low yields we see in the market may very well keep investor interest at the auctions to a minimum."
Mr. Hamilton called yesterday's bill auction "just plain vanilla, with average demand or a little less, given the expensive nature of Treasury securities." The three-month bill was sold at an average discount rate of 5.72 percent, up one basis point from last week; the six-month issue came at the same average rate, 5.72 percent, up 3 basis points from the previous week.
Traders saw some weakness in intermediate-term notes ahead of this week's auctions. Today the Government will sell $17.75 billion in two-year notes.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the new two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 6.23 percent and the five-year notes at a price to yield 6.46 percent. "Yields have backed up a bit since last week," Mr. Hamilton said.
Tomorrow the Government will sell $11.5 billion of new five-year notes and on Thursday $18.25 billion of one-year bills. Yesterday, the rate for a one-year bill was 5.67 percent. With buyers in no rush to acquire securities that some already consider pricey, dealers have had to sweeten or raise the yields on the new note supply.
In the corporate bond market, where sales have picked up in recent weeks to take advantage of the lower rate environmnent, the AT&T Corporation filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday to sell as much as $3 billion of debt to pay for several recent acquisitions and future growth.
With the return between corporate and Treasury debt securities widening, the American General Corporation, an insurer, and Pacificorp, a utility holding company, also plan to sell debt this week.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
 (000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.554	97.092	Discounted Rate	5.72%	5.72%	Coupon Yield	5.90%	5.99%	High Price	98.559	97.103	Discounted Rate	5.70%	5.70%	Coupon Yield	5.88%	5.97%	Low Price	98.552	97.092	Discounted Rate	5.73%	5.72%	Coupon Yield	5.91%	5.99%	Accepted at low price	24%	59%	Total applied for	$50,466,129	$49,397,650	Accepted	$13,647,536	$13,667,043	Noncompetitive	$1,489,846	$1,326,053	
Both issues are dated May 25, 1995. The three-month bills mature on Aug. 24, 1995, and the six-month bills mature on Nov. 24, 1995.

HEADLINE: 10 Companies Join in Effort to Lower Bids by H.M.O.'s

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
More than 100 health maintenance organizations are bidding this week for a chance to offer standardized health coverage to 240,000 employees of 10 big companies. The bidding is the employers' latest effort to push the H.M.O.'s to lower prices and let employer groups monitor the care provided by doctors and hospitals.
By banding together and offering $1 billion in combined buying power in 27 markets, the 10 employers hope to duplicate the successes of regional employer coalitions in a growing number of metropolitan areas, notably Minneapolis and San Francisco. 
 Michael Sydlaske, a principal with the William M. Mercer consulting firm, said that tomorrow was the deadline for bids from the H.M.O.'s.
The bidding is the first move by a new national health care purchasing coalition. Participants said 10 more big employers were considering joining the original 10 in the buying group.
"It could be as big as we want to make it," LuAnn Cash, a vice president of American Express, said. Still, the organizers said they wanted to stay relatively small to avoid the conflicts that typically plague large coalitions.
In a separate move, some of the same employers are working on plans with other big companies to negotiate with Government-financed Medicare H.M.O.'s to cover their retirees .
The 10 companies are expanding a program begun by American Express and Merrill Lynch & Company, which joined with Macy's in 1993 to negotiate jointly with H.M.O.'s in the New York area, Atlanta, California, Florida and Texas. The participants now include Sears, Roebuck, International Business Machines, the ITT Corporation, Marriott International, Pfizer Inc., and Nabisco Inc., the RJR Nabisco spinoff. Two other companies have asked not to be identified. Macy's dropped out after it was acquired by Federated Department Stores.
Jim Bronson, benefits director of Sears, said the coalition requested bids from the H.M.O.'s on April 26. He said Sears, where about 80,000 of the 115,500 employees and dependents are enrolled in H.M.O.'s in the 27 markets, expected to add to its roster of competing H.M.O.'s. Those already involved include Kaiser Permanente, U.S. Healthcare, United Healthcare, Cigna, Aetna and a number of Blue Cross plans.
Sears is involved in a separate program with the Towers Perrin consulting firm to move retirees into Medicare H.M.O.'s. Mr. Bronson said that some Sears retirees in Florida, California and Arizona had already joined Medicare H.M.O.'s.
Bob Dankmyer, a vice president of Marriott, said the H.M.O. purchasing group was an offshoot of a larger group of employers who provide coverage for 3.5 million people. He said some did not offer H.M.O.'s but they wanted to meld their purchasing power in negotiating for less tightly organized types of managed health care, including physician networks and modified H.M.O.'s that permit enrollees to pick their own doctors if they pay more for doing so.
Sean Sullivan, president of the National Business Coalition of 85 employer groups, said that half did some joint purchasing, often bypassing health insurers and dealing directly with hospitals. "Houston is the latest example," he said. Coalitions in San Francisco and the Minneapolis-St. Paul area were among the first. There are also purchasing groups in Orlando, Fla., Cleveland, Cincinnati and St. Louis.
John Brence, a vice president of Merrill Lynch, said company officials had formed their coalition after discussions with Alain Enthoven, an economist at Stanford University, who advocates competition to make health care more efficient.
Dr. Lonny Reisman, a cardiologist with the William M. Mercer consulting firm, visits the health maintenance organizations and audits their procedures for assuring good quality care. Merrill Lynch and American Express have frozen enrollment in several H.M.O.'s that were judged deficient in the quality monitoring.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up Against Yen on Hope For Reduction in Trade Deficit

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar surged to a seven-week high against the Japanese yen yesterday, bolstered by optimism that Washington's confrontation with Tokyo over automotive trade would help cut the United States trade deficit.
The dollar also received support from a sharp fall in the Japanese stock market. The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 351.73 points, or 2.18 percent, dragged down by concerns about weak corporate earnings. The decline prompted currency dealers to sell yen, which increased the demand for dollars. 
 "The dollar has really gained some ground versus the yen," said Michael Faust, a foreign exchange strategist at Bailard, Beihl & Kaiser, a money management concern in San Mateo, Calif. "The sanctions and the stock market plunge helped the dollar stay afloat."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 87.35 yen from 86.74 yen on Friday. The dollar slipped to 1.4410 German marks from 1.4440 marks.
The performance of the dollar elsewhere in the foreign exchange market was mixed, marked by thin trading that may have exaggerated price movements. Trading was light ahead of a meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy makers. While the market has already assumed that the Fed will not raise short-term interest rates at a meeting today, many dealers were exercising caution yesterday.
Also supporting the dollar against the yen yesterday were further comments by American officials that Japan must open its auto market or face sanctions.
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said yesterday that the sides were "not even close to agreement" on the auto trade.
Mr. Kantor pledged to follow through with threatened sanctions, which would impose a 100 percent import duty on $6 billion of the most popular Japanese luxury cars. The sanctions will take effect on June 28, but are retroactive to May 20.
The Secretary of Commerce, Ronald H. Brown, also said the United States was serious about the sanctions and "it wasn't just rhetoric."
After those comments, Japan's Ambassador to the European Union in Brussels, Tomohiko Kobayashi, said Washington's moves on trade threatened to erode pro-American sentiment in Japan.
Cars and auto parts account for almost two-thirds of Japan's $66 billion trade surplus with the United States. That imbalance has been seen as an important underlying reason for the dollar's long-term erosion against the yen, because it means Japanese exporters have enormous amounts of dollars that they must sell when repatriating profits.

HEADLINE: Albany's Unsound Tax Cuts

 BODY:
Gov. George Pataki and the Democrats in the New York State Legislature have reached agreement on an income tax cut that should help resolve the divisive budget battles of 1995 on terms that both sides can claim as some sort of victory. But their agreement will undermine New York's financial integrity. While scaled back from Mr. Pataki's original proposal, the tax cut is still too drastic to be carried out without further rupturing state services and aid to localities.
Mr. Pataki originally proposed a phased tax cut that would have ballooned in size to nearly $7 billion annually in four years, with no convincing strategy for curbing costs to pay for the revenue loss. He relied on the same wishful premises that have led to record deficits in Washington: that tax cuts would pay for themselves by stimulating economic growth. Some tax relief is needed to help economic development in New York State, but only if instituted carefully and targeted on taxes that dampen the business climate. The state has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs despite steep cuts in the income tax since 1987. 
 The tax cut accord reportedly worked out in Albany will be less costly in terms of revenue loss for the next fiscal year than Mr. Pataki's original proposal. It will grow in four years to only half the size of the Governor's proposal in terms of lost revenues. But there is still no way it can be paid for unless there is a boom in the state's economy, an extraordinary drop in the cost of welfare and Medicaid in the next few years -- and a willingness by state political leaders to carry out cuts rejected this year in education, higher education, mental health programs and other state services.
The Democrats are in a triumphant mood because they have forced Mr. Pataki to make the tax cut more progressive. But the Democrats have also trapped themselves. The tax relief for the wealthy is to be carried out in the first year, leaving relief for the middle- and lower-income groups for the subsequent two years, when it will be hard for Democrats to stomach the spending cuts, especially for the poor, that may be needed to pay for them.
The state should not be locking itself into multi-year tax cuts. Such an approach has attractions for Republicans who argue it is the only way to exact discipline on the spending side. But other Governors, including Christine Todd Whitman in New Jersey, have carried out tax-cut pledges one year at a time. New York, which already has one of the lowest credit ratings of any state, is in no condition to enact tax cuts that will throw its finances into structural imbalance for years to come.

HEADLINE: Crippling American Science

 BODY:
The budget plan passed by the House mounts an assault on scientific research, science training and American research universities that are the envy of the world. Blinded by ideological fury at government, House Republicans seek to abandon a crucial function of government, the provision of public goods like research that are undersupplied by private markets. Private companies will invest in research that is likely to raise their profit, but they are unwilling to invest in research whose benefits leak out to competitors. By abandoning government's irreplaceable role, the House budget would undermine America's technological base.
The magnitude of the House-passed cuts is shocking. Civilian research would fall over five years from about $32 billion to $25 billion, a 35 percent cut after accounting for inflation. Medical research, other than for AIDS, would fall by more than 25 percent. Robert Walker, chairman of the House Science Committee, says the plan would protect basic science. He dissembles. His budget would increase spending on research by the National Science Foundation. But the small increases would not keep pace with inflation, so the number of university-based scholars, graduate students and research projects that the N.S.F. supports would steadily fall. Indeed the plan envisions wiping out support for social science research. 
 The House budget would continue to support the space shuttle and space station, two costly hardware projects with constituencies in key electoral states, but it would provide little money for other aeronautical and space research. It would cut several energy research programs by between 35 and 80 percent -- eliminating thousands of university jobs -- and reduce research on high-speed rail and other transportation projects. Republicans say their cuts eliminate only applied research that business can undertake for itself, but they propose slashing nearly every program in sight.
Not all the research that Washington pays for makes sense. Some university-based research can sound ridiculously abstruse. But there is danger in indiscriminately chopping research and undermining a system that has for decades produced the best scientists and graduate programs in the world. The sectors in which America has led the world -- from computers and software to agriculture and aircraft manufacturing -- can trace their success to heavy Federal support.
Mr. Walker could have performed a valuable service by carefully sifting through Federal programs to weed out those that needlessly subsidize corporations for research and development projects that they would undertake for themselves. But massive cutting just to reach a balanced budget quickly risks damaging important economic assets.
The party that preaches cost-benefit analysis for Federal agencies ought to practice what it preaches. Cutting the science budget will save a few billion dollars a year in a $6 trillion economy. Knocking out innovative research can lead to stagnant productivity and growth. By that calculation, the House plan is an irresponsible gamble.

HEADLINE: How to Save Social Security

BYLINE: By Bob Kerrey and Alan K. Simpson 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Because we belong to opposing parties, the public might presume that we disagree on everything. But there is one critical matter on which we find common ground. We both believe that the time has come to re-examine some of the fundamental premises of the Social Security system. This is Social Security's 60th anniversary year. The needs of retired Americans have changed radically in six decades. Social Security deserves radical change, too.
Last week, we introduced legislation that would transform what is now a consumption-based system into a system that encourages savings and investment. Our bill would allow workers to divert nearly one-third of the employee's share of the Social Security payroll tax into a private I.R.A.-type account or an investment fund modeled after the thrift savings plan offered to Government employees. 
 The plan would also allow one-fourth of the Social Security Trust Fund to be conservatively invested by the fund's managing trustee in equities instead of the Treasury bonds to which they are limited by current law.
When combined with other reforms, this approach would yield at least three major benefits. First, it would give individuals greater control over how they plan for retirement. Second, it would help rescue the Social Security system so that all Americans know with certainty that a promise made is a promise kept. Third, it could increase private savings of 139 million working Americans by nearly $1 trillion over the next decade -- restoring the savings base on which healthy economies are built and maintained.
Last year, an estimated 139 million working Americans and their employers pumped $345 billion into the Social Security system. Under current trends, many of the 139 million have no reasonable expectation of receiving full benefits from the pension fund when they retire. Social Security has hundreds of billions of dollars in unfunded promises it will be unable to pay when the system goes bust in just over three decades.
The main reason is this: Social Security was designed as a consumption-based, not a savings-based, program -- a system under which each generation of workers pays taxes to support the previous generation in return for a promise that the next generation will, in turn, support it.
The system works provided that each generation has enough children to underwrite benefits. The baby-boom generation is producing proportionately fewer children. Today, there are nearly five workers paying taxes to support each retiree; when the baby boomers retire, there will be fewer than three.
The consequences of having a consumption-based system grounded on a 60-year-old demographic assumption that no longer holds true are clear. Without reforms, by the year 2012 every dollar the Government collects in taxes will go directly to spending on entitlements and interest on the national debt. A year later, in 2013, Social Security will begin running a deficit instead of a surplus.
Eighteen years after that, the entire system will be bankrupt -- around the time that workers in their late 20's today retire. Because there will be nothing but the payroll taxes of a small generation of workers available to finance the benefits of the large generation of retirees, our children would be forced to slash benefits dramatically or impose a huge tax increase on themselves.
Fixing this requires going beyond traditional proposals to raise taxes or cut benefits or a combination of the two. The nation must re-examine the consumption-based premise of the program. If it wants to save Social Security, it needs to start putting Social Security into savings.
Our plan includes reforms designed to restore long-term solvency to the system and leave room to begin a shift toward a savings-based approach. One reform would gradually raise the age of full eligibility for Social Security from 67 to 70, a change that reflects the growth in life expectancy since the eligibility age was first set at 65 six decades ago. The change would not affect anyone over the age of 51 today.
In addition, an independent panel would be asked to assess the accuracy of the Consumer Price Index, which is used to determine the size of cost-of-living adjustments. Most economists agree that the index generously overstates the inflation rate. Our bill would also limit cost-of-living adjustments; the top 70 percent would get only partial protection from inflation.
Allowing workers to invest nearly a third of their contributions in alternative investments would bring benefits to the economy. The United States has one of the lowest rates of private savings in the industrialized world, in part because most of the $345 billion pumped each year into Social Security is spent for everyday living expenses by retirees.
 Our international competitors understand the importance of savings; the payoff is clear in the strength of their economies and currencies. Japan, a creditor nation, saves nearly 20 percent of its gross domestic product. Germany, also a net creditor, saves more than 10 percent.
The United States, by contrast, saves less than 5 percent; worse, a big percentage of those savings are consumed by Government borrowing and therefore are not available for the private investment that creates jobs and wealth. Because we consume so much and save so little, America must borrow abroad; this has converted us from a creditor to a debtor nation in less than a generation.
We both believe that diverting part of the payroll tax to private investment plans would radically alter the entire culture of savings. Those who for the first time have large pools of private savings would be likely to see their value and begin to contribute more and more to them. Such a system would allow individuals the substantial benefits of compounding interest, which Social Security, as currently constituted, denies them, and would give the economy the benefits of a new foundation of savings that can restore our status as a creditor nation.
There are a variety of options for repairing Social Security, and both of us are open to suggestions. But one thing is clear. As our society's demography shifts and our population ages, social insurance in which one generation of retirees consumes the next generation's taxes will simply not hold up. Everyone is going to have to start saving more and saving earlier.
Savings has always been a foundation of a healthy economy. In an aging America, it's also an imperative for secure retirement. Making Social Security partly into a savings-based program means that we can build on its successes and strengthen this monumental legislative achievement for future generations and our evolving economy.

HEADLINE: Japanese Too Suffer From Trade Barriers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Trading War: No Way Out?" (front page, May 17): 
 There is no doubt that there are trade barriers in Japan against foreign imports.
Many Japanese industry professionals, economists and journalists have been raising their voices vigorously to lift those barriers as soon as possible.
Also, many Japanese consumers would appreciate more foreign products, ranging from gasoline and natural gas to American Jeeps and candies, at lower prices. They know that the costs are too high because of Government regulations, industry practices, and markups by big importers (mostly large corporations) and at each stop in the distribution. They pay all these costs. So, no doubt, Japanese consumers support a more open market policy.
Many economists say, to revitalize the market economy and survive in a globalized economy, it is essential for Japan to "liberate its market" to all countries.
Japan has been missing leadership for this task.
Japanese consumers travel to foreign countries and enjoy shopping where they can buy goods at less expensive prices, even products made in Japan.
However, United States enforcement obligating Japanese automobile companies to buy a defined number of American auto parts is not the appropriate course to persuade the Japanese people who want their markets freer and have been good allies of the Americans.
It only causes feeling of rejection of American power politics.
The Japanese media tend to interpret it as a campaign gimmick by the Clinton Administration to buy votes in Detroit for the 1996 election.
The United States Government must tell the Japanese its true objectives -- open the Japanese market for mutual benefit for both nations, instead of political gain for the Administration.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Chief Says Mexican Crisis Has Eased

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
The managing director of the International Monetary Fund said today that the Mexican financial crisis had been reduced to controllable proportions.
"I am confident the crisis has turned into a manageable problem," the top official, Michel Camdessus, told a meeting here of the Council of the Americas. Problems remain, Mr. Camdessus acknowledged, but "Mexico is headed toward recovery," he said, if it sticks with its economic austerity program. 
 He listed a number of encouraging signs that the recovery plan had taken hold. Mexico's trade balance moved from continuing deficits to a surplus in the first quarter of 1995, the peso has recouped some of its losses and domestic interest rates have eased, he said.
Mexico has been struggling to pull out of its worst financial crisis in more than a decade, set off in December by a badly bungled devaluation of the peso.
The Mexico City stock market rose sharply yesterday, with the main index jumping 78.67 points, or 3.91 percent, to 2,090.93.
Last week, though, Mexico's Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, said the Mexican economy was expected to contract sharply in the second and third quarters after a deceivingly mild decline in the first three months of the year. "I think unemployment and economic contraction will get worse before they get better," he said in a speech in Washington.

HEADLINE: Gray Eminence of Classical Music's Stars

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
He wields classical music's biggest baton, conducting conductors, orchestrating orchestras, giving voice to vocalists. But his name is not to be found on concert hall marquees or opera kiosks. When it comes to publicity, Ronald A. Wilford is happy to be Orpheus's silent partner.
As president of Columbia Artists Management Inc., the world's leading classical music booking and talent agency, the silver-haired Mr. Wilford casts a long shadow from the music canyon of West 57th Street to premier concert stages in New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Berlin, Vienna, Tokyo and other music capitals. His many top clients -- who commonly pay commissions of 10 to 20 percent -- include James Levine, Kurt Masur, Seiji Ozawa, Valery Gergiyev, Leontyne Price, Jose Carreras, Marilyn Horne, Kathleen Battle, Yehudi Menuhin and Andre Previn, along with a fair number of the world's leading orchestras. 
 Yet Mr. Wilford remains a cryptic figure who ridicules accounts of his power, even as he uses his vast knowledge of the business to drive hard bargains for his clients. "Publicity does not help me," he said in an alternately grumpy and playful conversation in which he parried most questions and declined to be interviewed at greater length. "I do not run a public institution."
Recent events, however, have focused attention on Columbia Artists -- known throughout the classical world as CAMI -- and the man who has run it unchallenged for 25 years.
Early this year, one of Mr. Wilford's top music managers joined a substantial list of former CAMI executives when he jumped -- or was pushed -- out of the agency. The exit of David Foster, who left CAMI after 22 years to become president of the rival ICM Artists, has raised the question of succession at CAMI, where Mr. Foster, 48, was widely considered a prime candidate to take over for the 67-year-old Mr. Wilford.
In 1993, Peter Gelb, whom Mr. Wilford called his only protege, went with Columbia Artists' classical music video unit when it was bought by Sony. ("He didn't leave," Mr. Wilford quipped. "I sold him.") And several other managers have left amid accounts of feuding among the agency's 18 semi-autonomous divisions.
Besides the threat a stronger ICM presents, CAMI is encountering a growing challenge, especially abroad, from another relative newcomer to the field, I.M.G. Artists, North America, a spinoff of the hugely successful billion-dollar-a-year sports management agency, International Management Group.
Mr. Wilford, for his part, professes indifference to any and all of this.
Why did Mr. Foster leave? "Simple," he said in the brief telephone talk. "We have a contract policy. David Foster was not under contract so he could leave anytime."
Retirement plans? "I'm in retirement."
And finally: "I'm very unimportant."
Mr. Wilford's success has not come on the strength of his musical training; indeed, he has none. Rather, associates say, he has demonstrated near-perfect pitch in recognizing talent and matching music director and orchestra: "picking winners," as one put it.
Others cite his commanding grasp of the industry and all the minutiae of drawing contracts and touring orchestras. "He knows every fact and figure," said Julie Kedersha, who worked at CAMI before opening her own agency. "He can calculate mileage and gas and how much the hotel is. He can go as fast as your calculator."
If you could match his mastery and prove him wrong, she said, "he'd back down." But if not, she said, "he'd eat you alive."
Associates call his nonchalance a cover, a mind-game for someone long enamored of psychotherapy, just, they say, as his oft-proclaimed penchant for privacy seems to invite scrutiny. "He cares very deeply about the artists he represents and his company," said Caroline Smedvig, marketing director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and a longtime friend.
But she said Mr. Wilford saw no client benefit in his being seen as "a nice guy," and was actually amused by his image as "the black knight of 57th Street."
Interviews over recent weeks with dozens of industry figures offer no dispute that Columbia Artists, with headquarters in an Italianate mansion across from Carnegie Hall, remains the giant of classical music, with a current roster of some 800 clients and a total of some 3,000 artists represented over the last 65 years.
It is heir to a management empire built by the redoubtable Arthur Judson. From 1930 to 1935, he managed the Philadelphia and New York Philharmonic Orchestras and the Lewisohn Stadium concerts in Manhattan. He was also was a radio pioneer who became the second-largest stockholder in William S. Paley's Columbia Broadcasting System and the sole owner of Columbia Records, while at the same time running a lucrative concert-management bureau that consolidated with other agencies to become what is now CAMI in 1930. Judson also created a revolutionary unit called Community Concerts, which organized local audiences around the country for lucrative pre-paid bookings featuring the agency's own contract artists.
Mr. Wilford, the son of a Greek janitor and his Mormon wife in Salt Lake City, went into business with another arts manager in New York before striking out on his own. In 1955, he staked his savings on the first American tour of the French mime Marcel Marceau. Mr. Marceau was a smash, and Mr. Wilford, building on that success, mastered the business of touring attractions.
In 1956, he married Janice Roberts, who worked at Columbia Artists. It was Mr. Wilford's second marriage, and three years later he joined the agency as Judson's protege. When Judson left CAMI in 1963 to start a new management venture, Mr. Wilford chose to remain, and succeeded to the presidency in 1970.
 
RELATIONSHIPS
Selecting a Stable Of Favorite Clients
 Not all of Mr. Wilford's relationships with artists have gone smoothly.
A dispute between CAMI and the pianist Andre Watts landed in court in 1990 after a disaffected Mr. Watts sought to reroute commissions through his new agent, I.M.G. Artists. After countersuing for nearly $300,000 and portraying Mr. Watts unflatteringly in court papers as money-driven, CAMI won a judgment in a suburban New York court of nearly $337,000, including interest and costs.
Earlier, in a tangle of professional and personal issues, Mr. Wilford, in his first years at CAMI, took on the pianist Anthony DiBonaventura. Booked on overseas tours, Mr. DiBonaventura found that his wife, with their five children, was leaving him for Mr. Wilford, who was leaving his wife and their adopted son.
The former Mrs. DiBonaventura -- Sara Delano Roosevelt, a granddaughter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and a stepdaughter of the newspaper publisher, Ambassador and Vanderbilt heir John Hay Whitney -- became Mr. Wilford's third wife. The two divide their time between a Fifth Avenue apartment, vacation trips to the Caribbean and Salzburg, Austria, and a house in West Stockbridge, Mass., near Tanglewood, where Mr. Wilford indulges a passion for gardening and tennis. ("Surprise," said a friend, "he hates to lose.")
Even admirers of Mr. Wilford and CAMI wonder how a star-packed agency can simultaneously advance the careers of dozens of competing artists, especially when, as some say, the managerial divisions are often at odds with each other. In Mr. Wilford's case, associates say, he handles his favorite clients and turns others over to other managers.
"People don't want to hear from John the Baptist," said Jack Mastroanni, an opera manager who left CAMI two years ago, along with his client the mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli. "They want to hear from Jesus Christ."
Mr. Foster, the most recent former apostle, said his decision to leave had less to do with CAMI than with the "wonderful opportunity" to become president of ICM Artists, replacing the long-serving Lee Lamont, who moved up to chairman. Mr. Foster described his departure as amicable and said that although he had offered to leave as soon as he gave notice last fall, Mr. Wilford had encouraged him to spend his final two months there winding up his affairs.
(This was in marked contrast to the departure of the one-time Wilford associate Sheldon Gold, who, before leaving to start ICM Artists in 1976, found himself stripped of his phone and held virtual prisoner by Mr. Wilford in a closetlike office. The Gold captivity has become so ingrained in the lore of the business that Mr. Foster's smooth departure was met with some incredulity. "Ron's lost his edge," one colleague told Mr. Foster.)
An amiable, round-faced man who colleagues say is as "schmoozy" as Mr. Wilford is often inscrutable, Mr. Foster was seen by some as a potential successor to Mr. Wilford. With his departure and others, CAMI "doesn't appear to have that depth of stable that it had in the past," said Thomas W. Morris, executive director of the Cleveland Orchestra.
"From my perspective," he said, "it was a loss for Columbia Artists and a gain for ICM."
One of the most perplexing aspects of Mr. Foster's departure was Mr. Wilford's apparent willingness -- even eagerness, according to some -- to see one of his longest-serving deputies go. Mr. Foster's portfolio, after all, included the Boston Symphony, the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra and other prize clients. He is barred for a year from taking clients with him.
ICM Artists has a more-than-respectable roster of its own, including Isaac Stern, Midori, Yo-Yo Ma, Emanuel Ax, Wynton Marsalis and the Israel Philharmonic.
Associates who spoke on condition of anonymity said that despite professions of amity, there had been some strain over Mr. Wilford's decision about a year ago to take the job of touring the Vienna Philharmonic, a high-prestige client, out of the Foster division.
Mr. Foster also realized, colleagues said, that he was destined to hit the same glass ceiling as his predecessors at CAMI, that is, Mr. Wilford was not the faintest bit interested in a corporate heir.
If Mr. Wilford shrugged off Mr. Foster's departure, he did not pretend indifference to the loss of Peter Gelb, who, by design, went with CAMI's video division when Mr. Wilford sold it to Sony Music Entertainment in 1993 for a price Mr. Wilford has put at around $6 million.
"I adore Peter," Mr. Wilford said, "but I cannot hold Peter back."
Mr. Gelb, 41, a son of Arthur Gelb, a former managing editor of The New York Times, was similarly effusive, calling Mr. Wilford "the visionary manager."
Mr. Gelb said his introduction to the Wilford style came as press representative for the Boston Symphony when he asked the CAMI president about making Mr. Ozawa, the orchestra's music director, available for press interviews. Mr. Gelb said Mr. Wilford had told him that if Mr. Gelb knew what he was doing, the maestro would cooperate.
Mr. Wilford also taught him, he said, never to enter a meeting carrying a briefcase for fear of looking like a salesman.
"I can't imagine Ronald ever retiring," he said.
While at CAMI, Mr. Gelb produced telecasts at the Metropolitan Opera, an arrangement that Joseph Volpe, who became the Met's general manager in 1990, viewed with suspicion.
"I didn't need an executive producer," the blunt Mr. Volpe said in an interview. "Guess why? I was the executive producer." It ended with Mr. Volpe once reportedly threatening to throw Mr. Gelb across Lincoln Center.
Music professionals close to Mr. Wilford and Mr. Volpe said a degree of tension was inevitable, given the strong management styles of both and the longtime bond between Mr. Wilford and James Levine, the Met's artistic director, which Mr. Volpe was said to regard as an axis.
Some of the tensions burst forth in last year's celebrated firing of the soprano Kathleen Battle, a notoriously difficult Wilford client. Mr. Wilford later complained to associates that the Met management had not provided the right person to smooth things over. But Mr. Levine's position appears secure; he is discussing Met projects into the new millennium.
 
CHALLENGES
Aides Departing As Rival Emerges
 The Foster departure was the most prominent of several. Earlier this year, John Mazzarella, a senior vice president of the Community Concerts unit, left Columbia Artists after 27 years, for reasons he declined to discuss. A deputy to Mr. Foster, Caroline Woodfield, followed her former supervisor to ICM. Yet another executive, Sean T. Bickerton is leaving this month -- amicably, he said -- after more than nine years to open his own agency.
Music managers throughout the industry link some of the discord at CAMI to efforts by Mr. Wilford to tighten control, including trimming expenses, closing the public relations unit and further concentrating the closely held stock, of which he holds a majority share.
In the past, the managers said, Mr. Wilford liked to call the company "employee-owned," allowing division heads to purchase CAMI stock and sell it back to the company at a profit after 10 years under certain circumstances. But recently, the stock policy has become more restrictive, they said. Details remain closely guarded and with the company privately held, there is no outside monitoring of its finances.
Columbia Artists is also facing a rising challenge from an unlikely source: a sports marketing and management giant barely a dozen years in the music business. But many music managers say that I.M.G. Artists, under its director, Edna Landau, now represents a stronger threat to CAMI than does ICM.
Mark H. McCormack, who founded the billion-dollar-a-year company on $500 some 30 years ago and wrote the 1984 best seller "What They Don't Teach You at Harvard Business School," said sports and music struck him as parallel fields.
Like sports, Mr. McCormack said in an interview, music is multinational, a discipline outside language. Money, at least at the high end, is big, leaving star performers, like star athletes, in need of tax and business advice. Corporate sponsorship, too, lends itself to musical events as well as sports. In one way, moreover, music surpasses sports as a marketing and management candidate: musical careers are often many decades long.
The soprano (and golfer) Kiri Te Kanawa, whom Mr. McCormack had met on the greens, smoothed his move into music. "Kiri said, 'I'm going to teach you culture,' " Mr. McCormack recalled. " 'The first thing you have to know is it's intermission, not half-time.' "
Among other recent high-profile catches, I.M.G. Artists signed the soprano Dawn Upshaw, formerly with CAMI. And it signed the teen-aged violinist Leila Josefowicz after Mr. McCormack spotted a writeup in People magazine.
The agency hopes to use both its vast economic resources and its 67 overseas offices to build an international clientele, Mr. McCormack said.
In what is likely to set off a kind of feeding frenzy by both the leading management agencies and the multitude of "boutique" agencies founded by managers who split off from the larger concerns, one of the longtime pillars of the industry, Harold Shaw, announced this week that he would be closing his twin agencies, Shaw Concerts and Shaw Attractions, on June 1, 1996. The action reportedly followed Mr. Shaw's announced intention to retire and the consequent pending departure of a pivotal lieutenant, Bill Capone. Potentially available as a result will be such stars as the soprano Jessye Norman, the pianists Garrick Ohlsson and Mitsuko Uchida, and the guitarist Julian Bream.
Mr. McCormack of I.M.G. said he was flattered to be seen as a major player and would compete hard. "We're aware of changes and a shifting power basis," he said. "We're just staying on our own road. Size is not where it's at."
Characteristically, Mr. Wilford represents himself as profoundly unfazed. "We are what we are," he said.

TEMPTATIONS OF A SUPERPOWER

144 pages. Harvard University Press. $18.95.
In "Pax Americana," his classic 1967 critique of American foreign policy, Ronald Steel looked at the motives behind two decades of United States intervention abroad and at its consequences. He argued that World War II ended decades of American isolationalism by wedding the nation's native idealism to enormous military might, and that the ensuing cold war had nurtured the country's global ambitions. In his view, America's fear of Communism and its moralistic desire to spread its own values to the world at large had had serious repercussions, including an infatuation with global power and influence, a willingness to subordinate rationally assessed national interests to grandiose principles, and "a dangerous gap in our foreign policy between our involvements and our means -- between what we would like to accomplish and what we can reasonably hope to accomplish." 
 The 28 years that have passed since the publication of "Pax Americana" have witnessed enormous changes in the world: the Vietnam War came slouching to a long-awaited end, Communism unraveled as the Soviet Union fractured and fell apart, the Berlin wall came tumbling down and a harsh new brand of nationalism surfaced around the globe. In his latest book, "Temptations of a Superpower," Mr. Steel, a professor of international relations at the University of Southern California, assesses these developments and analyzes America's current foreign policy objectives, habits and imperatives. The resulting book, based on a lecture delivered at the Library of Congress in 1993, is both an impassioned follow-up to "Pax Americana" and a provocative prescription for a new foreign policy based on humility and a recognition of limits, a prescription that is bound to be hotly debated in some circles.
 The opening chapters of "Temptations," which try to sketch in the dynamics of current international relations, will be familiar to the reader: not only do Mr. Steel's musings on the end of the cold war recapitulate his work in "Pax Americana," but his writings on the evolving global situation also retrace ground covered by a host of recent foreign policy books. Like Zbigniew Brzezinski (in "Out of Control: Global Turmoil on the Eve of the 21st Century"), Mr. Steel speaks of the dangers of a newly fragmented world, rebutting the views of Western triumphalists like Francis Fukuyama, who foresee the inevitable victory of liberal democracy around the globe. Like John Lukacs (in "The End of the 20th Century and the End of the Modern Age"), he predicts the waning power of both the superpower and the nation-state in general, as well as the fading of American hegemony. And like William Pfaff (in "Barbarian Sentiments" and "The Wrath of Nations"), he warns of the perils of America's optimism and of its desire to remake the world in its own image.
It is when Mr. Steel turns from a broad overview of global politics to the details of American foreign policy that he most forcefully engages the reader's attention. As he sees it, "We are still hobbled by our cold war ways of looking at the world," even though the world has suddenly and spectacularly become a very different place. He writes that the current military budget of $253 billion "is down fractionally from the previous year" but "is still 85 percent of the average cold war level," which makes "it as large as that of all the other nations of the world combined."
Such expenditures, he continues, have weakened America's ability to compete in the international marketplace, while Japan and Europe, freed from a focus on military concerns by the American security umbrella, have been able to "concentrate on productivity, market penetration, wealth and innovation: the kind of power that matters most in today's world." Instead of worrying so much about the nation's "global responsibilities," he argues, American policy makers might be wiser to focus on the host of domestic problems (from violence in the streets to poverty and a huge national debt) that make the country an upalatable role model to other nations. That policy makers have not done so, he suggests, is partly a reflection of the military bureaucracy's need to perpetuate itself and partly a reflection of the policy elite's own reluctance to abandon the heady notion of American hegemony.
As Mr. Steel sees it, the old American goal of containing Communism has recently given way to the larger (not to mention hubristic) goal of containing "global disorder," even as anti-Communism has been replaced by Wilsonian idealism "as the guiding light of American foreign policy." In his view, the Wilsonian concept of self-determination can lead "to the atomization of human societies," while the Wilsonian concept of collective security threatens to "embroil us in wars everywhere." This latter principle, he observes, was invoked by the United States in three recent situations involving real or threatened military action: in Somalia, in Serbia and in Haiti.
"In not one of these cases," Mr. Steel writes, "could it be argued that a vital American interest was involved. The cold war, for all its irrationalities, was based on real military, economic and political issues. With the cold war behind us, we now engage in conflict for reasons of virtue. However desirable this standard may be for individuals, it is not suited to nations. It can lead either to unending wars for peace in the name of morality or to a reputation for hypocrisy and empty rhetoric."
Under what circumstances should America intervene in the internal affairs of other nations? In Mr. Steel's opinion, justifications come in two categories: morality ("to alleviate extraordinary and severe degrees of human suffering") and self-interest ("to protect vital natural resources; to quell regional disorder in areas vital to American security; to defend the nation's borders"; "to preserve a favorable balance of power in such critical areas as Western Europe, and to prevent nuclear and ecological threats to our national well-being").
Although Mr. Steel lays out these arguments in his usual logical, sharp-edged prose, his discussion of specific examples feels highly perfunctory. In a mere two pages, he argues that the United States should have intervened in Rwanda and Cambodia but was correct not to resort to armed intervention in Bosnia because the death of civilians there "took place in the context of a traditional war over territory, and neither the intention nor the result was the systematic eradication of a people, which is the strict definition of genocide." The human rights abuses in Haiti, he adds, are deplorable but are also part of "the condition under which much of the world lives." Such highly telescoped assessments, laid out almost as an afterthought near the end of the book, feel simplistic, cavalier and coldblooded, and they undermine the more persuasive and carefully considered arguments in Mr. Steel's book.

HEADLINE: Mexico Plans Bigger Role For Military Against Drugs

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 22

 BODY:
Faced with a growing threat from narcotics traffickers, President Ernesto Zedillo has ordered the Mexican military to take a greater role in the anti-drug fight, including the use of air force jets to intercept planes loaded with cocaine, Mexican and United States officials say.
The move represents an important shift in policy after years in which successive Mexican administrations, worried about tempting the military with new opportunities for corruption, restricted army involvement in the war against drugs largely to the eradication of marijuana and opium poppy crops. 
 "The determination was made that the situation with drug trafficking was so serious that the army had to be used now," a senior Mexican official said.
Mexican and American officials said that during the last two months, army generals have taken part more extensively in a redesign of the Government's drug-control strategy. Army field commanders have also begun working with federal police officials around the country to coordinate new regional plans to intercept drug shipments.
Most notably, officials said, Mr. Zedillo has responded to the traffickers' use of converted passenger jets to transport huge amounts of cocaine by quietly ordering the military to deploy its F-5 jet fighters and T-33 trainers in pursuit.
The interception program is still in an early phase. Military pilots are being trained to track the traffickers' jets, and it may be months before their effectiveness can even be evaluated. Already, though, several officials said, a significant -- if symbolic -- line had been crossed.
"In the past, there was always a reluctance to allow the military to play a stronger role," a United States official said today. 'But with the Zedillo administration, that mindset has dissolved."
The budget for the military's counter-narcotics campaign, which includes the steady involvement of 7,000 to 12,000 soldiers in the destruction of drug crops, is projected to more than double this year in peso terms. According to Defense Ministry figures, it is to rise from about $27 million last year to $38 million in 1995, adjusted for the prevailing exchange rates.
Officials said the Clinton Administration was expected to provide the Mexican Attorney General's office with about 20 surplus UH-1H Huey helicopters to carry police agents in drug-interdiction operations.
Discussions are also continuing between the two countries about the possibility that the United States might lend or sell as many as several dozen of the far more sophisticated UH-60 Blackhawk transport helicopters for the same purpose.
Mexican officials have made no public announcement of the planned deployment of military jets and helicopters against the old Boeing 727 and Aerospatiale Caravelle passenger jets that have been used by Colombian cocaine traffickers during the last year. Those measures may nonetheless be the most concrete of several steps that the Zedillo administration has pledged to take in response to American pressure for stronger anti-drug efforts.
Following the Clinton Administration's orchestration in February of a $52 billion international rescue package for the Mexican economy, Mexican officials also agreed to a wider exchange of drug-intelligence information, greater cooperation to stop the laundering of drug profits and measures to crack down on leaders of Mexican smuggling organizations.
The Mexican military has played a secondary role in drug-control operations since the establishment of a Government counternarcotics intelligence center in Mexico City in 1992.
In concert with the program run by Mexico and the United States to intercept planes carrying drugs into Mexico, military forces are alerted along with those of the federal police forces when United States Customs Service radar planes deployed over the Caribbean or the Pacific track drug smugglers flying north.
Army troops are sometimes sent to block the traffickers' paths or to back up the federal police, but they leave most law-enforcement tasks to the civilian police. Similarly, the Navy conducts some interdiction operations at sea, but generally does not act on its own initiative.
Even so, the relationship between the Defense Ministry and the Attorney General's office -- which controls the Federal Judicial Police, the drug-intelligence center and the National Institute for the Combat of Drugs -- has often been tense.
Some Mexican law-enforcement officials say the federal police have still not forgotten an episode on Nov. 7, 1991, in which army troops attacked seven federal agents who followed a plane carrying drugs to a clandestine airstrip in the western state of Veracruz. Autopsies suggested that the soldiers -- who appeared to be protecting the shipment and who allowed the traffickers to escape -- beat several of the agents and shot them point-blank.
Some officials said the military's new assertiveness in anti-drug operations was simply part of an effort to perform better duties it already had.
Several Mexican officials said Mr. Zedillo was turning to the military partly out of frustration with the corruption running rampant in the federal police. At the same time, however, the officials played down the danger that such corruption might spread to the army and air force, saying the two forces would generally not plan operations and would continue to turn over criminal suspects to the police.
For the time being, the military has committed six of its Northrop F-5 fighter jets and four aging T-33 Shooting Star trainers to intercept the converted passenger jets, a United States official said. The American official and a Mexican official said the military might deploy more of the F-5's later.
Both military jets are able to fly at speeds comparable to the 500 nautical miles per hour of the passenger jets, although they have smaller fuel tanks and therefore a shorter range.

Horry's Only Basket Puts Rockets Over Top

BYLINE: By TOM FRIEND 

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, May 22

 BODY:
He pump-faked east, west, north and south before taking the shot. The clock read :10, his Houston Rockets trailed by a point, their superstar passed him the ball on a whim and then Robert Horry went into his own personal stall.
He measured, sighed, thought about what he was having for dinner and then heard his entire bench say, "Hurry!" 
 But it was a jump shot worth waiting for because Horry's 18-footer splashed in with 6.5 seconds remaining and made the San Antonio Spurs see red, 94-93.
As is the Rockets' way, they still had to sweat it out until the final buzzer, but Spurs forward Sean Elliott babied a four-foot jump shot.
David Robinson was boxed out by a 38-year-old and could not tip it in.
So, Houston improbably took Game 1 of the four-of-seven-game Western Conference finals, stuck a collective sock in the mouths of 33,337 fans at the Alamodome and made San Antonio's home-court advantage irrelevant.
There are only 10 of them on the bench, but the Rockets have been coming off respirators to win for more than four weeks now.
"This is a crazy team," guard Sam Cassell said. "This team doesn't make sense sometimes. Look around. These characters. I mean, Robert waited 20 seconds to take that shot. He faked three, four times. This team is sick."
At Phoenix over the weekend, an unsung guard named Mario Elie defeated the Suns with a shocking 3-pointer, causing Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon to say of Elie, "He's a wicked man."
Asked if Horry was the wicked one tonight, Olajuwon said, "He is lucky man."
Considering it was Horry's first basket of the night, that is about right.
"I had no doubts," Horry said. "That's no time to be doubting yourself."
Meanwhile, on most valuable player eve, a relic named Charles Jones turned Robinson into an impostor. With Olajuwon pestered by foul trouble (his fifth came with 8 minutes 10 seconds to play), the 38-year-old Jones was assigned to Robinson. The Spurs center has cleared out space for his m.v.p. trophy -- which he is expected to receive Tuesday -- but he was only 1 of 10 from the field through three quarters and finished with a soft, uninspired 21 points and 7 turnovers.
"I don't think we could've played worse," Robinson said. "This has been our worst game in the playoffs, easily."
In the game's taut moments, Robinson was hounded by Jones, who began the season unemployed in Washington and who was signed only when power forward Carl Herrera dislocated his shoulder.
"Defense is his life," Rockets Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said of Jones.
Jones's brother, Caldwell, played just like him, but when Spurs center Moses Malone was asked to compare the brothers tonight, he said, "Caldwell shot more."
Not anymore. Charles Jones, who had scored one basket all regular season and only one in the playoffs, had 6 points tonight.
"Playoff high?" he said. "That was my career high."
"Old fella came in with a reverse layup tonight," Cassell shouted in the Rocket locker room.
But Clyde Drexler (25 points) and Olajuwon are still the old reliables. Olajuwon, in fact, had 27 points, 8 rebounds and the assist of the night. The score had been tied at 92-92 when Robinson made 1 of 2 free throws with 45.9 seconds left. Olajuwon then did not look in his rearview mirror and allowed Doc Rivers to steal the ball from him, but Elliott missed two free throws with 26.6 seconds left.
That set up the last possession for Houston. Olajuwon was trapped on the baseline and swung the pass to Horry. The 6-foot-10-inch forward seemed to count to 10 before letting it fly.
"Like a free throw," guard Kenny Smith said.

HEADLINE: Partnerships Help Create New Schools

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
Over three decades, New York City educators have opened scores of small public academies, including 46 high schools in the last two years. In the series, all the new high schools are profiled, as well as older ones that served as models and some elementary and middle schools organized according to the same principles. As this listing shows, the founding of the schools has often involved unusual collaborations. A number have been sponsored by educational reformers working with organizations like community groups, colleges, churches and even a labor union.
 
Community Service Schools
 
Benjamin Banneker Academy for Community Development
At Pratt Institute, Steuben Hall, 329 Dekalb Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn. 

IDEA: Learn to build a neighborhood.
OPENED: 1993. (N.V.)
CURRENT ENROLLMENT: 125.
PEAK: 500.
GRADES: 7-10; eventually, 7-12.
Named after the 18th-century black engineer, the academy was founded to teach math, science and technology through internships in building renovation and other urban planning projects. "The changes in science and technology mean increased competitiveness," said Assemblyman Roger Green, who wrote the proposal for the school. "Technological literacy becomes as important as language literacy."
The school's first project director left after a difficult year marred by tensions with officials from Pratt Institute, who seemed to view the school as an unwanted new burden during the Institute's own financial crisis; at one point, Pratt wanted to terminate Banneker's lease. But representatives from both schools attended a retreat, and relations appear to have improved. The Board of Education is constructing permanent classrooms in a leased building at 77 Clinton Avenue at a cost of $11.5 million. DAVID GONZALEZ

HEADLINE: Switching His Tactics, Clinton Begins Preparing Proposal for Balancing the Budget

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
After weeks of refusing to offer specific counterproposals to Republican plans to balance the Federal budget in seven years, the White House has begun to prepare ideas, and President Clinton has explicitly said for the first time that he believes such a goal is achievable.
Asked on Friday in an interview with New Hampshire radio stations whether he was prepared to set a target date for balancing the budget, the President said, "No." But he added, "I think it can be done. Well, it can---- First of all, it can be done in seven years." 
 Mr. Clinton did not specify what he would propose, and, indeed, warned of the risks in trying to balance the budget. But White House aides said his comments were meant to show his determination to continue reducing the deficit and prevent the Republicans from pre-empting him on a popular issue.
"The question is, What is the penalty and what are the tradeoffs," Mr. Clinton said, according to a transcript obtained by The New York Times. "I think it clearly can be done in less than 10 years. I think we can get there by a date certain."
The interview was broadcast on New Hampshire Public Radio stations in Concord, Hanover and Keene.
Mr. Clinton has never opposed the principle of trying to balance the Federal budget, and Vice President Al Gore and other Administration officials have variously suggested that 2002 was a reasonable goal.
But for weeks, most of Mr. Clinton's top advisers, from his chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, down, have denounced Republican efforts to meet such a deadline as unrealistic efforts to fulfill an "arbitrary campaign promise." They have also warned that proposed cuts in the growth of spending on Medicare and other programs would harm the elderly.
The President's chief economic policy adviser, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, went so far as to say that locking the Government into the goal of balancing the budget by the turn of the century could risk worsening any economic downturn that might occur in the meantime.
But now, in the words of one senior economic adviser, "the President wants to move the debate from whether or not you can balance the budget at a time certain to a debate over how you get there, what are the tradeoffs and what are the priorities, and even what the best time path is."
To that end, White House budget aides have been reviewing potential alternatives to the Republicans' plans, though aides emphasize that Mr. Clinton has not softened any of his three main conditions for negotiations: That the Republicans drop their proposed tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, agree to protect educational programs and curtail the growth of Medicare only as part of a broader overhaul of the health care system.
"It's not like they're preparing a balanced budget of their own to be sent up," a senior White House aide said of his Administration colleagues. "But I'd be dishonest if I didn't say this is a reflection of the President's interests and his unwillingness to let the debate be diverted."
House Republicans have already passed a broad outline of how they would balance the budget, and Mr. Clinton said he wanted to wait to evaluate the Senate's proposals, and see how differences were reconciled.
"Then I have to do what I promised them," he added. "I promised them that if they would adopt a budget, that I would negotiate with them in good faith, and that I would propose a counterbudget.
"That's what I---- I have given them my word I'd do it, and I will do it. I owe that to them, and I owe it to the American people."
One of Mr. Clinton's greatest frustrations is that he has not won more political credit for his willingness to reduce the deficit in the five-year economic plan that passed Congress in 1993 without a single Republican vote. After last year's electoral rout by Republicans, the White House decided against deeper deficit reduction in favor of reviving Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign promise of tax relief for the middle class, which he set aside on taking office.
Since then, the President has often struggled to be heard above the Republicans' own promises of bigger tax cuts and bigger spending cuts in an effort to put the budget on a path to balance by 2002.
In recent weeks, as the scope -- and potential pain -- of the Republicans' plans became clear, the White House rallied traditionally powerful political constituencies like the elderly by warning of the dire consequences, while refusing to provide specific budget-cutting proposals of its own. That has led Republicans to accuse Mr. Clinton of ducking the tough choices of leadership.
The White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, sought today to portray the President's comments in the New Hampshire interview as a natural evolution.
"He has said all along we want to reduce the deficit and move toward a balanced budget," Mr. McCurry said, "and he's prepared to lead the way forward. We are going to engage at some point in the process, and probably sooner rather than later."

HEADLINE: Fed Policy Makers Decide To Leave Rates Unchanged

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
Faced with slowing growth in the American economy and a strengthening dollar, the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged at a meeting today.
The Fed's interest rate policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee, signaled its decision with a brief statement. "The F.O.M.C. meeting ended at 12:15 P.M.; there is no further announcement," said Joseph R. Coyne, the Fed's chief spokesman. 
 The phrasing of the announcement matched almost exactly the wording of statements from previous meetings at which the Fed left interest rates unchanged.
Few economists were surprised by the Federal Reserve's announcement. The central bank doubled short-term interest rates in the 12 months that ended on Feb. 1 in response to a burst of economic growth that appeared likely to produce some increase in inflation.
A wide range of economic indicators since then has pointed to slower growth, while inflation has barely risen. Producer prices and consumer prices did creep up in April. But last year's sharp increases in prices for raw materials like wheat and for semiprocessed goods like steel have not yet produced the run-up in finished good prices that many Wall Street economists and some Fed officials feared last year.
In the bond market, longer-term interest rates have been sliding this spring as Treasury prices rallied in reaction to the dwindling inflationary pressures. Today, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond fell to 6.86 percent, from 6.91 percent.
The economy's slowing growth led some economists to speculate today that the Fed might ease monetary policy and push down interest rates later this year. "There is a chance of easing in July and a bit greater chance in August, but I don't see any chance of tightening in 1995," said Lawrence Chimerine, an economist at the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington research group.
Other experts say there is just as much chance of another interest rate increase this year as a rate cut, depending on whether the economy grows too fast or too slow. "We're right on the razor's edge of that, and I think that's where the Fed is now," said Darwin L. Beck, an economist with the First Boston Corporation.
The Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet next on July 5 and 6, and again on Aug. 22.
The Fed still faces risks that the economy will grow too fast or too slow, most likely as a result of fluctuations in consumer spending. The last two months have produced signs of weak consumer spending, notably a slowness in auto sales.
But some Fed officials also thought in June of last year that consumer spending was slowing and the economy with it, only to find that shoppers soon returned in force to stores. That experience may have left Fed officials cautious.
Falling interest rates in recent weeks have produced a surge in new mortgages and in mortgage refinancings, as consumers try to lock in lower rates. Many economists say lower rates will produce a recovery in home building and in sales of appliances like washers and dryers.
But many refinancings involve homeowners trading adjustable-rate mortgages for fixed-rate mortgages at about the same rates. Because these homeowners' paymentsremain roughly the same each month, they may not have much added cash to spend on goods and services, said Sung W. Sohn, a senior vice president and chief economist at the Norwest Corporation, a bank holding company in Minneapolis.
The weakness of the dollar earlier this year had put some pressure on the Fed to push up interest rates to make American financial investments more attractive.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Is Hopeful After Going to Albany in Quest of Money

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 23

 BODY:
With the state budget headed toward completion, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani made a last-minute sojourn to Albany in search of cash today and said he thought New York City would fare better than Albany leaders have previously suggested.
But it was far from clear yet whether he was right. 
 At the same time today, two of the city's fiscal monitors, City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi and State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, both Democrats, warned that the city may face sizable budget shortfalls, even if the Republican Mayor gets all of the money he wants from Albany, because much in his budget plan relies on risky assumptions.
Also today, Democratic Assembly officials said they had acceded to Gov. George E. Pataki's proposal to cut $58 million in Metropolitan Transportation Authority funds that pay for free transit passes for about 350,000 students in New York City. Because the M.T.A. already faces a $150 million budget gap this year, the cut could increase the likelihood of a fare increase.
"Our belief is there was no way to guarantee how that money would be used, and we might be throwing it away," said one Assembly official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
On his rounds of the Capitol, Mr. Giuliani received some good news from Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, who predicted that anticipated state budget cuts in welfare, Medicaid and other entitlement programs would save the city between $550 million and $600 million of the $700 million sought by the Mayor.
Tonight, Mr. Pataki said that estimate was "within the range of what we think is possible." State officials had predicted previously that Mr. Giuliani would receive far less, opening a large gap in the city budget for the fiscal year that begins on July 1.
Mr. Giuliani sounded markedly upbeat as he assessed the continuing state-budget negotiations, which seem to be moving slowly but steadily toward completion. "From what I know of the compromise that's been reached, it gets us a very, very large percentage of the savings that we need," he said.
Mr. Giuliani focused his lobbying efforts today on several priority measures that would drive additional cash to the city. One priority, he said, is for the state to keep a commitment it made last year to pick up a greater share of the cost of pre-kindergarten programs for handicapped youngsters, a $78 million saving for the city. Another request was for the state to keep last year's commitment to raise revenue sharing for local governments, worth $31 million to the city.
Mr. Giuliani also pleaded for the state to pay a larger share of the cost of managed-care programs for Medicaid recipients, worth $22 million. And he asked the Governor and the Legislature to grant him a waiver from a state requirement that forces the city to spend the same amount as the state on the City University. The waiver is necessary to enact Mr. Giuliani's proposal to cut $38 million from the CUNY budget.
The Mayor's total request for state aid, which combines cash assistance with entitlement cuts, is valued at $950 million.
Mr. Giuliani raced through the Capitol from one half-hour meeting to the next, with news conferences after each. Along the way, he received encouragement at each stop. None of the leaders dismissed his requests on philosophical grounds, although none expressed any certainty the money would be found.
Mr. Pataki and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, both Republicans, used Mr. Giuliani's request to apply pressure to the Assembly Democrats to make deeper cuts in social programs.
"I think in the context of the entire budget, what the Mayor has requested today is not unachievable," Mr. Pataki said. "That's not to say it won't be difficult because it requires additional cuts in entitlement programs that thus far the Assembly's resisted."
Handing a double dose of criticism to the Mayor, Mr. Hevesi and Mr. McCall questioned the viability of several of Mr. Giuliani's budget proposals.
They both said the budget relied heavily on actions of others -- including the Federal and state governments and the city's municipal labor unions -- that the city is by no means certain to achieve.
Both of them also criticized the Mayor's estimates on tax revenues and pension contributions and expressed doubt about the city's ability to find $130 million in new revenues for leasing the city's two airports to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The largest uncertainty involves the assistance from the state that Mr. Giuliani lobbied for today. Mr. Hevesi and Mr. McCall both estimated that the city would receive only $400 million to $500 million of the $950 million the Mayor has sought.
The Mayor's budget also calls for other legislative changes that would save the city millions of dollars beyond the $950 million, but there is no assurance they will be approved. Those include changes in special-education requirements that would save $155 million, legislative changes in the city's legal liability to save $45 million and a waiver to allow the city to cut its contribution to the City University.
In all, Mr. Hevesi said $1.4 billion to nearly $2 billion of the Mayor's gap-closing proposals were "substantial risks" that could fail to become reality. Mr. McCall, who recently has feuded with Mr. Giuliani, took a softer tone but still said the Mayor's budget included $948 million in risky or uncertain proposals.
Mr. Giuliani defended his budget proposals. He said the city had made a significant "downpayment" toward ending its recurring budget gaps in the last year and would continue to do so with the new budget.
"This budget, assuming that it goes through in the form in which we've proposed it, will make even more of a downpayment on it," he said, speaking to reporters at the Capitol. "We're working our way out of, really, 40 or 50 years of consistently spending more money, with maybe one or two exceptions, than the rate of growth in the economy."

Chart: "LEDGER: Soft Spots in the Mayor's Budget"
Mayor Giuliani's proposed budget relies on several sources of income, or savings, for the city that are not assured because they rely on actions by the Federal or state governments, or others. Yesterday both the city and the state comprollers published reports showing how much money is involved.
 The state Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, estimated that the Mayor's budget includes $948 million that the city might never actually get, while the city's Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, warned that the total could be between $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion.
These are some of the proposed sources of income, or savings:
 
Savings from state cuts in welfare and Medicaid, and new state aid -- up to $500 million
 
Proposed state waiver to allow city to cut CUNY's budget -- $38 million
 
Proposed state legal reforms -- $45 million
 
Proposed additional aid to come from the new Federal budget -- $50 million
 
Savings to come from negotiations with labor unions -- $600 million
 
Proposal to renegotiate airport leases with the Port Authority -- $130 million
 
Over-estimation of tax revenues -- $93 million
 
Unbudgeted, projected overtime costs -- $81 million
 
Unbudgeted additional pension-fund contributions -- up to $100 million

HEADLINE: Bradlees Halts Dividend, With Big Loss Foreseen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: BRAINTREE, Mass., May 23

 BODY:
Bradlees Inc. suspended its 15-cent quarterly dividend today and predicted a fiscal first-quarter loss about twice as large as had been expected.
The struggling regional discount department store, which has been hurt by the expansion of national chains, also said it would not develop new stores in 1996. 
"Bradlees is a turnaround company in its first stage of transition," said its chief executive, Mark A. Cohen. "It is unfortunate that we are living through one of the worst retail periods in memory, but then we have no control over the general economy."
The Braintree-based Bradlees, which was spun off from the Shop and Shop Companies in 1992, said it expected to report a loss of $2.25 to $2.75 a share for the quarter that ended last month.
Four analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research had been projecting an average loss of $1.38. Bradlees said it is scheduled to release the earnings in mid-June.
The announcement came after Bradlees stock closed today off 12.5 cents, at $7.50, on the News York Stock Exchange.
Earlier today, the Standard & Poor's Corporation placed its ratings of the Bradlees debt on Creditwatch, with negative implications.
The ratings agency said it was concerned about the company's liquidity under its current credit arrangement, "given expected continuing weak operating and financial performance."
Same-store sales, or sales in stores open at least a year, fell 6 percent in the quarter ended April 29. The retailer said today that it intended to replace its credit agreement with a larger, more flexible asset-based facility in the middle of this year.
"We believe that the elimination of the $6.8 million dividend is in the best interests of Bradlees and its shareholders," Mr. Cohen said.
Bradlees operates 136 stores in Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
Wilmington, Del., gets a shot in the arm from office construction for two big banking companies.

BYLINE: By Maureen Milford 

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del.

 BODY:
TWO big banking companies are generating a small burst of office construction in downtown Wilmington. Both plan to relocate operations from the suburbs.
One of the companies, the MBNA America Bank, a big issuer of Visa and Mastercard credit cards, has nearly completed the first of two towers on 11th Street, the main boulevard into the city from Interstate 95. The tower is in Rodney Square, a prestigious office location. 
 The other institution, the Wilmington Trust Company, has architects at work on a design for a 10-story building to supplement its headquarters on Rodney Square.
Both banks are responding to the vigorous courting of Mayor James H. Sills Jr., who was joined in his efforts by Wilmington 2000, an economic development group made up of business leaders. The city offered a variety of tax breaks, and has worked to smooth the path to the approvals required for new development.
Until the MBNA America Bank agreed to consider the city for its new headquarters, the site on Rodney Square had been an embarrassing and unsightly hole left over from a failed real estate project of the 1980's.
Now the final touches are being put on a nine-story neoclassical building of 350,000 square feet designed by Heery International Inc. of Washington. It will serve as offices for MBNA's executive staff and business development functions.
The building shares the square with E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, the Hotel du Pont, Wilmington Trust and the Delaware Chancery Court, where many of the country's prominent takeover battles have been fought.
When the work on the MBNA building is completed in July, the bank will shift workers from its sprawling suburban complex in Newark, a town near the Maryland line 11 miles southwest of Wilmington.
The bank has grown in its 13-year existence to become the state's second-largest private employer, with 5,800 employees. Du Pont is the largest, with 16,300 employees in Delaware.
The bank's physical growth has been equally rapid. No sooner had it begun work on the new headquarters than it was scouting properties on neighboring city blocks. In March MBNA said it would begin work on a companion to the Rodney Square building. It had quietly bought two neighboring properties for $2.7 million for the project.
The second building, which will house the bank's telemarketing, computer processing and training operations, will be smaller, at 225,000 square feet. It will be connected to the Rodney Square building by an elevated walkway.
As a result of the moves, MBNA will have as many as 2,000 more workers in downtown Wilmington, a boon to the retail district and wage tax base.
The planned Wilmington Trust building, which will be three blocks west of Rodney Square on 11th Street, will be the first of possibly two buildings to be built by the bank in the next decade.
The bank will shift about 650 people to the building when it is completed in 1997, more than half of whom will come from the bank's suburban building near New Castle.
When the move is complete, Wilmington Trust will put its 13-acre suburban campus and 85,000-square-foot building up for sale, saying the downtown offices will meet its space requirements through 2015.
While there is still a large inventory of space here that is less than prime, most office users are looking at new construction because of the smaller floor sizes of older buildings. Today companies want at least 40,000 square feet of space for the best use of office furniture systems, said Daniel R. Reeder, vice president of CB Commercial Real Estate Group Inc. in Wilmington.
Some are worried that land in the most desirable areas will be spoken for. The state Committee for the Delaware Justice Center, which is working to consolidate all the state's courts in Wilmington into one new building, had its eye on the site that MBNA chose for its headquarters.
The committee is now looking at other sites in the city. One proposal for the justice center called for the construction of a tower behind the existing classical facade of the Daniel L. Herrmann Courthouse on Rodney Square, the building in which the Chancery Court is situated.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Recovers From Weakness In Europe and Ends Up vs. Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar was steady against most leading currencies yesterday after recovering from a bout of weakness in Europe, where dealers were drawn to German marks because of fears about the new French Government's economic agenda.
The dollar traded within a tight range. A decision by Federal Reserve policy makers to leave interest rates unchanged had little effect on the market. Currency dealers had expected the Fed to take no action at the meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee yesterday. 
 The Fed has raised short-term interest rates seven times since February 1994 to stem inflation and slow the economy. Higher rates tend to attract investors to dollar-denominated assets.
"There was just no economic news to get this market going," said Christopher Iggo, an international economist at the Chase Manhattan Bank.
In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 1.4436 German marks, up from 1.4410 on Monday. The dollar slipped to 87.10 Japanese yen from 87.35.
The dollar weakened against the mark at the start of New York trading after the new Prime Minister of France, Alain Juppe, outlined his Government's budget plans.
He reiterated many of the measures that were announced during the campaign of President Jacques Chirac in early May. Those included employment incentives and tax breaks on real estate investments.
But he also added that the minimum wage would be "raised significantly," which worried some investors, sending them selling French francs and buying marks. That indirectly hurt the dollar.
"The mark is considered the safe-haven currency," said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign-exchange dealer at the Bank Leumi Trust Company in New York. "Many investors are worrying how the French are going to go through with all of this."
The strengthening of the mark against the dollar was only temporary and the dollar recovered after European trading concluded.
The dollar was weighed down against the yen amid uncertainty of what would happen with the American trade sanctions against Japan.
The United States has imposed an import duty of 100 percent on $6 billion of Japan's most popular luxury cars in an attempt to press Japan to open its auto market. Washington said it rescind the duty if an agreement was reached with Tokyo by June 28.
"The market is starting to wonder what will happen with the sanctions and whether they will help" lower the bulging United States trade deficit, Mr. Waxman said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Fledgling World Trade Arbiter Listens to the War Cry of Giants

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 23

 BODY:
At the annual meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development here, one of the major players turned out to be not a member of this select club of 25 rich nations but an invited guest.
As Renato Ruggiero, the Director General of the new World Trade Organization, went from meeting to meeting, he had to fight his way through the crush of television cameras. 
 Mr. Ruggiero's high visibility only underscored one of the biggest worries here -- whether a brewing trade war between the United States and Japan over car imports will undermine, even negate, the very agency created to settle international trade disputes.
"The threatened United States sanctions against Japan could sabotage the entire concept of the W.T.O.," a European trade official said. "I don't know why the Americans did this just five months after the thing was started. The timing is just bad."
The World Trade Organization, which came into being on Jan. 1 in Geneva, replaces the headquarters organization of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. GATT saw plenty of disputes, but none with the magnitude of this one facing its successor -- the hot new round of argument over access to the Japanese market of 6.5 million cars each year and the American threat to impose 100 percent tariffs on luxury Japanese cars.
Today, as Japanese and American representatives tried desperately to convince fellow O.E.C.D. members of the correctness of their positions, the question many were asking was: Can the agency under Mr. Ruggiero -- whose candidacy had been opposed by both Washington and Tokyo until it was clear there was no real alternative -- bring the two warring sides together?
When GATT went out of existence at the end of last year, after more than 100 countries had signed the Uruguay Round agreement liberalizing world trade by eliminating or slashing tariffs, many experts saw the World Trade Organization as the arbiter and protector of the new free trade.
They predicted that it could become the most important international economic agency in the 21st century, possibly eclipsing the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
These experts envisioned the agency's dispute settlement board, which will have the final word on trade disputes, as the forum for resolving the myriad of bigger and smaller such arguments every year. It would aim to prevent its members from backsliding into protectionism.
Many of the Government ministers here today were highly critical of Washington's threatened sanctions against the Japanese. Most agreed that Japan needed to open its markets, but nearly everyone condemned sanctions. In part, Europeans see such sanctions as a political tool to bolster President Clinton's re-election prospects next year.
They also fear side effects of strong-arm tactics. One possibility is that the United States will use sanctions against them. Another is that if a settlement is reached, it will be one primarily involving the United States and Japan, effectively excluding European auto makers. Finally, Europeans -- particularly the Germans -- argue that their auto makers have heavily invested in building car distributorships in Japan and are now seeing the first results. They note that European car sales in Japan are almost twice the level of American sales.
"Our companies have invested a lot and made the effort to penetrate the market," said Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's Economics Minister. "We are not interested in the United States companies earning a cheap dollar by forcing a managed market."
Trying to calm the troubled waters, the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, promised today that Washington would abide by any ruling the World Trade Organization made. Mr. Kantor also tried to drive home the point that any opening of the Japanese market would benefit not only American workers, but Europeans and even Japanese.
In an interview, he said that the dispute with Japan "is not going to overwhelm the W.T.O," adding: "We have gone to the W.T.O. We'll abide by the W.T.O."
But he criticized his European colleagues for not being tougher on the Japanese. Alluding to the threat of sanctions, he said: "What you're hearing here is a little bit of, 'We'd rather you not do this. We want you to be successful. We'd just rather you not proceed in this manner because we're a little frightened you will use it against us.' "
Still, it is Washington's threat of sanctions that leads many to say that the United States has weakened the W.T.O.'s position in world trade disputes. If the world's largest economic power sees no problem imposing a trade action, even though it simultaneously seeks a settlement through the W.T.O., doesn't that send a signal to small countries that such an approach is acceptable?
Several European Government officials pointed out that perhaps what the Japanese feared most was that even though the United States had agreed to abide by any W.T.O. decision, the complex review and appeals process could take as long as two years.
In the meantime, if an agreement with Japan is not reached by June 28, Washington will impose tariffs that could total more than $6 billion a year, effective May 20 -- money that the United States would not necessarily be obliged to repay Japan and its auto makers for lost sales, even if it lost the case.
For his part, Mr. Ruggiero said he was sure that the World Trade Organization would rise to the challenge of taking on this dispute between economic giants.
"I do not want to overdramatize this," he said. "It arrived at the beginning of its life, and we will handle it."

HEADLINE: No Question of Fed Nominee's Pro-Tax Views

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Peter Passell's defense of Alicia H. Munnell's candidacy for a Federal Reserve slot (Economic Scene, May 18) employs newspeak, which illustrates exactly why Republican opposition to Ms. Munnell is growing. 
 Mr. Passell refers to "members of Congress who have never met a tax expenditure they didn't like." "Tax expenditure" is newspeak for any of that portion of wealth individuals are permitted to keep: Mr. Passell is referring to members of Congress who have never met a tax they do like.
In that light, opposition to Ms. Munnell's position by those who oppose new taxes becomes clearer.
Mr. Passell then equates the absence of a putative new tax on accrued income in pension plans with an "adverse impact on income distribution."
This assumes that income distribution is a desirable yet incomplete role of government.
Again, it should be no surprise that those who do not agree with this position oppose Ms. Munnell's appointment. When someone employs newspeak in an influential forum, watch your wallet.

HEADLINE: Turkey Beats Kurds With an Old Stick

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (column, May 17) writes in awestruck tones of Turkey's "bad neighborhood," as if it were something truly new and the main source of the country's serious difficulties -- which it is not. He barely mentions Turkey's most urgent problem -- that is, its Kurdish insurgency and the Ciller Government's refusal to deal with the issues it raises other than by force. 
 Mr. Friedman describes the Kurdistan Workers Party, or P.K.K., which leads the armed revolt, as a Marxist organization that aspires to carve a separate Kurdish state out of southeastern Turkey. That is the Turkish (and United States Government) line. On the chance that the P.K.K. itself might have something to say about this, I recently sent a list of questions to its General Secretary, Abdullah Ocalan. Here, in part, is what Mr. Ocalan replied in regard to the allegation of Marxism:
"We are dedicated to a philosophy that is based on democracy and pluralism, not on the power of the state. We favor a synthesis of capitalism and socialism, an economic structure in which individuals will freely develop to their fullest potential."
And about breaking off from Turkey: "It is unrealistic for the P.K.K. to insist upon a separate state. . . . We hereby explicitly declare that we do not insist on a separate state of our own. . . . We want a Spanish or American type federalism."
Those who uncritically echo the charge that the P.K.K. is Marxist and separatist (and "terrorist") should understand that the purpose of the charge is to justify Ankara's policy of military repression of ethnic Kurdish aspirations. That policy worked in decades past when governments were considered free to do as they pleased with people within their borders.
Today it guarantees a Turkey consumed by civil war, economic misery and a rising tide of Islamic fundamentalism, far too unstable to play the role of regional bulwark that the United States and other NATO allies would assign it.

HEADLINE: Argentines Voted For Continued Change

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The election results in Argentina are a good sign of a maturing democratic society. President Carlos Saul Menem won a second term with nearly 50 percent of the vote. The Radical Party received only 19 percent of the votes for president, coming in third. 
 In Congress, the vote was 42 percent for the Peronists and 22 percent for the Radicals, making them the second party in Congress. In certain provinces, like Cordoba, the Radical Party won the gubernatorial race by a greater margin than Mr. Menem won as President. In Buenos Aires, he lost to a third party. So the political process is working.
I do not think the results give anyone a blank check, but rather show that Argentines want to continue the process of change that is now going on both economically and socially, and they believe that the credibility of the Government must continue to maintain stability.
Argentina faces the task of restructuring a nearly bankrupt banking system and bankrupt provinces and creating a method of handling the huge unemployment in a country that tends to think foreign investment is the savior, when it will be development of products for export and Argentine investment that will remake the country.
The Argentines will have to learn that because you have the technology for first-world stock exchanges, that in itself does not remake a country.
The President and his Economy Minister, Domingo Cavallo, who was a force in Mr. Menem's victory, deserve credit.

Toyota Considers Suit Against U.S. Sanctions

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 23

 BODY:
The Toyota Motor Corporation is considering filing suit against the United States Government in an effort to remove or reduce the impending sanctions on luxury vehicles, company officials said today.
"If there is legal ground to act, we have to explore the possibility," Toshiaki Taguchi, a Toyota director in charge of North American sales and public affairs, said today. 
But he and a company spokesman said the company had not made a decision. If action is taken, they said, it would not occur until sanctions are actually imposed on June 28.
Toyota also warned today that earnings would suffer if the United States imposed 100 percent tariffs on 13 models of Japanese luxury cars. The 13 include all five Lexus models made by the company. Toyota, Japan's largest auto maker, warned about the tariffs' impact while reporting strong earnings.
Besides Toyota, other auto makers and American dealers of Japanese luxury cars were believed to be exploring court action to stave off the tariffs.
"Such an idea is widely talked about among Toyota and other manufacturers," Eiji Hirabayashi, the spokesman for Toyota in Tokyo, said.
Another company official said the Washington law firm of Hogan & Hartson, which represents Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., the company's American sales arm, had prepared a memo outlining the possible legal approaches but cautioning against proceeding.
A lawsuit would have to be filed by Toyota's American subsidiary. Since a case that might take years to resolve would be of little help, a company filing a lawsuit would no doubt seek an injunction to stop the tariffs from being imposed.
It was difficult to predict how successful such a lawsuit might be. The proposed tariffs fall under Section 301 of United States trade law, which has never been challenged in court.
The tariffs would formally go into effect on June 28 but would be retroactive to cars that entered the United States as of last Saturday.
Mr. Hirabayashi said the company was particularly considering a lawsuit that would contend it was illegal for the Government to make the sanctions retroactive.
Toyota is concerned about this because it is continuing to export Lexus cars to the United States. If the tariffs were applied retroactively, the company would face a huge payment on luxury cars that entered the United States after last Saturday. Mazda and Honda have already stopped exporting cars that would be subject to the tariffs.
Mr. Hirabayashi said companies in the industry were exploring broader attacks on the sanctions as a whole. One approach would be to argue that United States law requires the Government to go to the World Trade Organization to resolve a dispute before imposing sanctions.
A likely place for filing such a case would be the Court of International Trade in New York, where Government decisions to impose duties can be appealed.
That is the court in which the Nissan Motor Corporation won a suit in 1993 against the Government over the tariff on imports of its Pathfinder sport-utility vehicle. The ruling was upheld by a Federal appeals court in 1994.
While sanctions could hurt sales and earnings, Toyota posted a healthy gain for the nine months that ended March 31. The company earned 131.95 million yen, or $1.48 billion. The reporting period was for nine months because Toyota changed the end of its fiscal year to March from June to put it in line with the accounting practices of most large Japanese companies. Toyota did not provide figures for the corresponding period a year earlier.
Still, the results were well above the 125.81 billion yen in earnings reported by Toyota for the 12 months that ended June 1994.

Bond Rally Sends Rates Downward

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bonds rallied yesterday, sending interest rates to their lowest levels in nearly a week on speculation that the Fed would cut short-term interest rates soon.
The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee met without changing the Fed's monetary policy. After the meeting, the Fed's spokesman simply said, "There is no further announcement." 
 William Shea, senior vice president-head government trading at Nikko Securities Company International, said that Treasuries received a lift from a report in The Washington Post yesterday that suggested Fed officials would lower the overnight bank loan rates, better known as the Federal funds rate, sometime this year. The article said that the central bank could cut short-term rates as much as 1.50 percentage points this year, if growth slowed to a 2.5 percent pace.
Analysts said that since the economy was widely predicted to grow at less than that rate in the first quarter of this year, the newspaper article effectively presented a case for an easing of rates in the near term.
Other market watchers attributed some of the market's rise to a 1.1 percent drop in the Mitsubishi/ Werthein Schroder weekly sales report, saying that the bond market yesterday was driven by technicals.
Some analysts noted that dealers who tried to set shorts ahead of the auctions, could not because the market failed to give ground, forcing them instead to cover quickly. A short occurs when a market participant sells borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back later at lower prices, thereby pocketing the difference. However, if prices are rising instead of falling, shorts need to cover, that is buy back the securities in order to limit their losses.
According to some trading desks, the two-year note auction went well, with the average yield coming in at 6.15 percent, down sharply from the April auction when the yield was 6.52 percent, and the lowest since June 21, 1994, when the yield was 6.04 percent.
Today the Treasury will auction $11.5 billion in five-year notes, and in when-issued trading they were offered at a price to yield 6.37 percent.
Mr. Shea said he thought that the market was working on breaking out from a consolidation phase and resuming its upward path. In fact, he said, seasonally and technically he likes the market. "This is one of the best times of the year to buy," he said, adding that the yield on the long bond might get to 6 3/8 to 6 5/8 percent in the near term before a substantial correction in the market.
In a technical analysis, Mr. Shea notes, bond price changes have developed a chart formation that is characteristic of fast market moves. This suggests that the market is in the late stages of a bull move, he said.
Eric Hamilton, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said, "There are still concerns that investors are not fully prepared to take on any further supply, and the five-year and one-year auctions today and Thursday may have a harder time finding investor favor" than did the two-year note.
In the Johnson Redbook weekly retail sales report released yesterday sales were up three-tenths of 1 percent for the first three weeks of May versus April. This was down slightly from the four-tenths of 1 percent gain reported last week and was slightly lower than some economists had expected.
Elsewhere, municipals rose in step with the rally in Government bonds, as investors concentrated on yesterday's $1 billion in new debt securities.
In the day's largest scheduled competitive sale, Connecticut sold $125 million in special tax obligation bonds in an offering awarded to Chemical Securities Inc.
The bonds were priced to yield from 4 percent for an issue due in 1996 to 5.75 percent in 2014 and 2015. And because the bonds were insured by the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company they are rated triple-A by the major rating agencies.

HEADLINE: Boeing to Cut 5,000 More Jobs Than Originally Expected

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
The Boeing Company said yesterday that it expected to eliminate 5,000 more jobs this year than it originally anticipated, bringing the total number of cuts to 12,000. The company said its new forecast resulted from actions taken to reduce costs to stay competitive.
The additional job cuts would occur at a time when the airline industry has returned to profitability after four years of losses. But Boeing officials said the duration of the recession raised doubts about how soon airlines would be ready to order new airplanes. They also said that to remain competitive with the European Airbus Industrie consortium and other aircraft manufacturers, Boeing had to continue reducing costs. 
 Boeing shares closed at $57 yesterday, up 75 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said the increased number of job cuts were not surprising in light of the early retirement program Boeing announced last month, and were more reflective of increased manufacturing efficiency than of pessimism.
"What the company is saying is that the ability to lower employment this month is really the result of efficiencies they've achieved, and not another production-rate cut," William B. Whitlow, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities in Seattle, said. "The company is really making a lot of headway in increasing productivity."
Boeing said a significant portion of this year's job reduction would result from the one-time special retirement-incentive program offered to employees last month. The 13,000 employees eligible have until June 16 to decide whether to take part in the program. So far, more than 6,000 have said they would do so. Job cuts for the year so far totaled 3,600, leaving 2,400 that must be cut by layoffs or attrition to meet the revised goal of 12,000, a Boeing spokesman said.
"We're pursuing aggressive efforts to reduce costs so that we can maintain and expand our leadership position in the market," Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman, said in a statement. "These additional job reductions are the result of efforts to trim the size of our nonmanufacturing work force and improved processes to design and build aerospace products more efficiently."
Most of the added 5,000 job cuts were expected to occur at Boeing plants in the Seattle area. Boeing currently employs 113,900, down from 117,300 at the beginning of the year. As a result of the special retirement program, the company may have to hire new workers in some divisions, Boeing said.

HEADLINE: GRAMM PROPOSAL FOR DEEP TAX CUT KILLED BY SENATE;
Clinton Draws Line on Vetoes On 2 Subjects

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
Confronting the Republican Congress on several major fronts, a combative Clinton Administration today threatened to veto foreign aid legislation the President denounced as "isolationist," as well as any welfare bill that would turn the Federal food stamp program over to the states.
At the same time, the President backed away from his remarks to New Hampshire radio stations on Friday, suggesting that he was preparing his own counterproposal to Republican plans to balance the budget over seven years. 
 After saying that he believed such a goal was achievable, Mr. Clinton returned instead today to themes sounded by his own advisers, calling the seven-year goal "an arbitrary period" that would require "massive tax increases or massive budget cuts," which would hurt the nation's standard of living.
The veto threats, delivered personally by Mr. Clinton and by the Agriculture Secretary, Dan Glickman, continued White House efforts to put the Republicans on the defensive and draw sharp distinctions between the President and the Congress.
And while the White House has insisted that Mr. Clinton's comments in New Hampshire reflected only a marginal shift in his tone and thinking, it was clear from his remarks today that he and his top aides were concerned that the remarks would be interpreted as a significant shift in strategy and draw him into negotiations before he is ready.
Indeed, Senate Republican leaders leapt to deride Mr. Clinton for what they called his "secret plan" to balance the budget, noting that he had endorsed the balanced budget in a key primary state known for its anti-tax mood. "It's strange that only people in New Hampshire have heard about this plan," said the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, who is the front-runner for the Republican nomination to challenge Mr. Clinton.
For the first time today, Mr. Clinton said he would veto legislation under consideration in the Republican Congress that would cut foreign aid and eliminate the Agency for International Development, the United States Information Agency and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
As the House began debating a measure to cut foreign aid by 15 percent over the next two years and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee worked on its own bill, Mr. Clinton spoke at a news conference in the Rose Garden and assailed the legislation as "the most isolationist proposals to come before the United States Congress in the last 50 years."
Singling out the House proposal, Mr. Clinton said it would compromise efforts to stop North Korea's nuclear program, endanger the Administration's policy toward Russia and restrict the President's ability to fight illegal immigration. "Taken together, these constraints represent nothing less than a frontal assault on the authority of the President to conduct the foreign policy of the United States and on our nation's ability to respond rapidly and effectively to threats to our security."
It was at a hearing of the Senate Agriculture Committee today that Mr. Glickman made it clear that Mr. Clinton would veto any attempt to turn the food stamp program over to the states.
Mr. Glickman said that wrapping food stamps into block grants for the states would do away with a valuable feature of the food stamp and school lunch programs, which as entitlement programs automatically expand to meet increased need in a recession.
But the chairman of the committee, Senator Richard G. Lugar, said that despite the veto threat he was considering suggestions by Republican governors to give each state a lump sum of Federal money to run its own food assistance program.
Mr. Lugar, an Indiana Republican, said he had not decided whether to recommend such changes and added that he had heard nothing on the question from Mr. Dole.
On the question of balancing the budget, when Mr. Clinton was asked if he was prepared to set a target date, he said: "No, but I can say this, I think it can be done -- well, it can -- first of all, it can be done in seven years. The question is what is the penalty and what are the tradeoffs. I think it clearly can be done in less than 10 years."
Today Mr. Clinton emphasized the pain involved in balancing the budget by the year 2002, saying "that would require massive tax increases or massive budget cuts, which would be unfair to our long-term objective to stabilize the incomes and the way of living of the American people."
Seeking to explain the change in emphasis, White House officials later said that since Friday Mr. Clinton had asked for detailed figures on the kinds of cuts needed to balance the budget in seven years and had rejected them as untenable. They also said he was irritated that news accounts of his New Hampshire remarks had interpreted them as signaling a shift in policy.
The White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, also suggested that the President had signaled a willingness to negotiate too early, because House and Senate negotiators have not agreed on their own outline for balancing the budget by 2002 and have not indicated if they are willing to compromise with the White House.
Asked if the President's change in tone was designed to keep the emphasis on the Republicans, Mr. McCurry said, "Bingo!"
"The Republicans are still wrestling with their own resolution, and there's a huge internal contradiction in their two versions of a budget resolution," he said. "And the President has made it clear that they've got to reconcile that."
Asked if the President would offer specific full-scale budget alternative, Mr. McCurry said: "It depends. And it depends on what type of posture the Congress will be in at that point.
Mr. Clinton repeated his three longstanding conditions for negotiations with the Republicans: that they drop tax cuts for the wealthy, protect education programs and curtail the growth in Medicare only in the context of overhauling the health care system. He also added a fourth, that Republicans back off from their plan to repeal the scheduled expansion of tax credits for low-income working families with children, which were enacted after Mr. Clinton made them a central feature of his 1993 economic plan.

HEADLINE: U.N. Links G.O.P. to Boat People's Riots

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, May 23

 BODY:
United Nations officials asserted today that a Republican-sponsored proposal to offer asylum in the United States to thousands of Vietnamese boat people set off riots last weekend that left more than 200 injured in Hong Kong.
They also warned that the bill could lead to a new exodus from Vietnam. 
 Refugee officials say the riots last Saturday began when 1,500 Vietnamese, many of them carrying handmade metal spears, refused to be transferred from one detention camp in Hong Kong to another in preparation for their deportation to Vietnam. It was the most violent clash in years between the boat people and the Hong Kong police.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which oversees the detention camps in Hong Kong, said the Vietnamese were emboldened to riot by the recent move by Republicans in the House of Representatives to offer asylum to as many as half of the 40,000 Vietnamese still held in detention camps in Asia.
"Absolutely," said Jahanshah Assadi, head of mission for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, when asked if there was a connection between the legislation and the riots. During the riots, he said, "you saw U.S. flags all over the place, you saw portraits of President Clinton all over the place."
At least 180 Hong Kong fire, police and corrections officers were hurt in the clashes on Saturday in the Whitehead detention center, the largest of the Hong Kong camps used to detain the Vietnamese. Dozens of Vietnamese were also hurt in battles in which the camp was blanketed by thick clouds of tear gas.
Representative Chris H. Smith, a New Jersey Republican who is a sponsor of the legislation, said in a statement today in Washington that there was no evidence of a connection between the legislation and the violence in Hong Kong. It is "grossly unfair to blame resistance to forced repatriation on the very people who are trying to come up with a peaceful and gentle solution to the problem of these refugees," he declared.
Mr. Smith has said that many of the Vietnamese residents of the camps, including Buddhist monks and former soldiers of the American-backed South Vietnamese Government, are legitimate political refugees who could be persecuted by Vietnam's Communist Government if sent home.
While the Republican-drafted legislation is opposed by the Clinton Administration and faces an uncertain fate in Congress, word of the Republican plan is already circulating in the camps in Hong Kong, where nearly 21,000 Vietnamese are now detained. Mr. Assadi said in a telephone interview that the Vietnamese who joined in the riots "have the false hope of going to the United States."
Even if the bill is defeated in Congress or vetoed by President Clinton, he said, "the damage has been done," since many Vietnamese now believe that they can resist deportation because "they have strong support from influential members of Congress."
Mr. Assadi said the American asylum proposal could also lead to a new exodus of Vietnamese, taking to rickety boats and pushing off into the dangerous waters of the South China Sea in the hope of becoming one of the lucky 20,000 who might be offered resettlement in the United States.
"That risk is definitely there now," he said. The $30 million asylum plan is part of a foreign affairs appropriations bill now before the full House of Representatives. The bill has already been approved by the House International Relations Committee.
While some Vietnamese rioters waved photographs of President Clinton last weekend, the Administration is in fact a strong advocate of a United Nations-backed plan to return virtually all of them to Vietnam.
While the United States granted asylum to most of the more than one million Vietnamese who fled their homeland after the Vietnam War, sympathy for the boat people has mostly run out. The State Department says that virtually all Vietnamese who remain in Asian detention camps are economic migrants who have no legitimate fear of persecution in Vietnam and are not entitled to asylum.
The deportation program, known as the Comprehensive Plan of Action, was supposed to empty most of the detention camps around Asia -- there are also large camps in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand -- by the end of the year.
The Hong Kong Government is clearly outraged that the moves in Congress may have contributed to the violence in the camps.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Rebuke by White House
 WASHINGTON, May 23 (By The New York Times) -- Administration officials said today that they had predicted that the proposed Republican measure would encourage thousands of boat people who were not qualified for refugee status to refuse to be returned to Vietnam.
"We are opposed to the proposed legislation which, at the 11th hour, seeks to abrogate an international undertaking," said one State Department official. "The proposed legislation would reopen large-scale screening of those already found to be ineligible for refugee status."
Administration officials predicted that the bill would encourage further riots like the one that occurred on Saturday in Hong Kong.
"The proposed legislation will end voluntary return to Vietnam and create new levels of false hope and result in further disturbances," a State Department official said.
Administration officials assert that the $30 million the bill would set aside to handle the Vietnamese migrants would result in less money being available to handle those found to be legitimate refugees from Vietnam, Cuba, Bosnia and Russia.

HEADLINE: Focus on Federal Power

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
The surprise in the Supreme Court's decision on term limits on Monday was not the result; ever since the Court agreed last June to decide the case, it had been widely assumed that the Justices would find state-imposed limits on Congressional terms to be unconstitutional.
Nor did the surprise lie in the divided vote. The case, argued last November, was the oldest undecided one on the Court's docket, suggesting that a struggle of some dimension was under way that would be unlikely to produce a unanimous ruling. 
 Rather, the startling aspect of the 5-to-4 decision in U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton was how close the Court came to rewriting the script of modern constitutional law and of long-dominant political thought.
Justice Clarence Thomas's dissenting opinion, signed also by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia, would have deposed the Federal Government from its primary role in the constitutional system and resurrected the states as the authentic organs of democratic government.
Taking the opinion at face value, and recognizing that the Court would not actually go so far in the crucible of a real case, it is only a slight exaggeration to say that the dissent brought the Court a single vote shy of reinstalling the Articles of Confederation, the affiliation of sovereign states that the Constitution replaced with the Federal system in 1789.
"It is hard to overstate the importance of how close they came to something radically different from the modern understanding of the Constitution," Prof. Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard Law School said in an interview.
Furthermore, it is barely a month since the same four Justices, joined then by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy to make a 5-to-4 majority, ruled in United States v. Lopez that the authority of Congress to regulate interstate commerce did not reach as far as it had been generally assumed for nearly 60 years. The Court held in that case that Congress did not have the power to make it a Federal crime to possess a gun near a school.
The two events -- what the Court accomplished in the Lopez decision and what the dissenters nearly achieved this week -- have together put in play for the first time in a half-century fundamental questions about the essential nature of the Federal Government. While the dissenters fell short this week, they framed the terms of the debate, retrieving it from the scholarly journals and think tanks to which it had long been relegated and placing it center stage at the Supreme Court.
"The Court is reaching the question at the heart of it all: Did we authorize all this government?" said Roger Pilon, an enthusiastic supporter of the Court's new focus who runs the Center for Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute, an influential libertarian research organization here.
Cheerfully conceding in an interview today that the underlying question was one of the legitimacy of the national government, Mr. Pilon said: "When you ask the question 'by what authority?' you are asking the most fundamental question in law and in politics. And it's absolutely consistent with the mood of the country that wants to get Washington off our backs."
Justice John Paul Stevens, the 75-year-old liberal Republican who wrote the majority opinion striking down state-imposed term limits, is really the Court's "most reactionary member," Mr. Pilon said, because "he is defending the ancien regime" of centralized Federal power that is enshrined in the Court's modern precedents. He added that Justice Thomas, at the age of 47 the Court's youngest member, was "speaking for the future" in his states' rights dissent.
Whether that is an accurate forecast of the Court's balance of power depends in part on where Justice Kennedy casts his vote as the debate continues to unfold and, more saliently as the 1996 Presidential election approaches, on future appointments to the Court.
It is a measure of how unexpected has been the emergence of the Court's debate over Federal power that no recent Supreme Court nominee has been asked more than a passing question about the issue during the confirmation process.
Confirmation hearings that have examined in excruciating detail constitutional questions ranging from the right to privacy to the authority of the President to deploy troops have understandably skipped issues that have appeared firmly settled since the New Deal, like the scope of Federal authority over the economy.
But the last few weeks at the Court have virtually guaranteed that this omission will not continue. The next "litmus test" for judicial confirmation could easily be the vigor with which a nominee endorses the dissenting Justices' statements in the term-limits case that "the Federal Government's powers are limited and enumerated" and that "the ultimate source of the Constitution's authority is the consent of the people of each individual state, not the consent of the undifferentiated people of the nation as a whole."
"This is a Court that is reopening first principles," Prof. Paul Gewirtz of Yale Law School said in an interview. Both Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion in the Lopez case and Justice Thomas's dissent on Monday used the phrase "first principles," Professor Gewirtz noted.
What those first principles are, in fact, is the heart of the debate. "Some of what Justice Thomas thinks of as first principles were actually the first principles of those who opposed ratification of the Constitution," Professor Gewirtz said. He noted that Patrick Henry, an opponent of ratification who once declared, "I am not really an American, I am a Virginian," demanded at the Virginia ratifying convention in 1788, "Who authorizes the gentlemen to speak the language of 'we the people' instead of 'we the states?' "
"We the people of the United States" is, of course, the opening phrase of the preamble of the Constitution. Justice Stevens, in his majority opinion in the term-limits case, cited the preamble for another of its famous phrases, "a more perfect union."
But the Court is so divided on the basic question of national structure and identity that even the Constitution's preamble, a paragraph so familiar as to strike modern readers as platitudinous, provided no common ground between the majority and the dissent.
Justice Thomas noted in a footnote to his dissenting opinion that as originally drafted at the Philadelphia convention, the opening phrase was "We the people of the states of New Hampshire, Massachusetts" and so on, and that the phrase "the United States" is used throughout the Constitution "consistently as a plural noun."

HEADLINE: Making It Easier to Get Justice in America

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Make Haste Slowly" (column, May 15): Imagine our surprise when we found something on which we could agree with Anthony Lewis. While we are not in accord on all civil justice reform issues, he makes a very strong point about lowering the costs of litigation by curbing some abuses of plaintiffs' lawyers. 
 When we introduced our civil justice reform legislation this year, we included a limitation on attorneys' contingent fees that Mr. Lewis praised. That bill is pending before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The fee limit, which has the endorsement of legal scholars from Norman Dorsen to Robert Bork, is one sure way of putting more money in the hands of injured victims.
Studies show that the injured receive too few of the dollars spent in the liability system. Most of the money goes to the system and to the lawyers on both sides, who profit from the status quo.
We also propose an early-offer, rapid-recovery mechanism that would enable injured parties to recover a specified amount that would include all of their economic losses, both past and future, without a legal battle.
Both of these reforms change the incentive structure of the legal system, which too often rewards the most contentious and protracted litigation. Defendants must be encouraged to make fair and reasonable offers at an early stage; plaintiffs need incentives to accept them. These proposals do just that.
The Senate has just completed action on much-needed product liability reform legislation. We anticipate further legal reforms in the 104th Congress and look forward to Mr. Lewis's continued support of our efforts to put more money faster into the hands of injured persons.

In My Next Column

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
I've been keeping my eye on Mexico lately, watching the economic indicators there so I can be the first columnist to write that America's $20 billion bailout of Mexico -- which I favored -- has worked.
This is not that column. This is the column just before that column -- the one that says there are a lot of positive indications the Mexican bailout is working, but that it's too soon for a definitive judgment. 
 Am I a chicken, or what? Not really. Because there is something definitive that can be said right now about the Mexico bailout. It always had two objectives. One was to save the Mexican economy from melting down; the other was to save the system from melting down -- the system of developing countries adopting free-market models, privatizing their state-owned industries and financing their growth with domestic savings and private capital from developed countries.
While it's still unclear whether the bailout will bail out Mexico, it is clear that it has preserved the system, by giving time for the other developing countries that were being dragged down with Mexico to get their balance sheets in order and disengage from Mexico's fate. In other words, Mexico's fate is still in doubt, but it's now much less important.
At the peak of Mexico's crisis a lot of investors called their brokers and screamed in panic: "Get me out of all emerging markets" -- without distinguishing. That's why Mexico's financial collapse threatened to set off a domino effect. What the U.S.-led bailout of Mexico did was buy time for the next two dominos in line, Brazil and Argentina, to fortify themselves and to persuade investors that their stories were different from Mexico's.
Argentina just overwhelmingly re-elected President Carlos Menem, who ran on a platform of continued free-market reforms, combined with tight fiscal and monetary policies that will hurt many Argentine workers but promise long-term stability. In other words, Argentine voters looked at Mexico and instead of saying let's try a different model, said let's stick with the same model only do it right. Other dominos rattled by Mexico, like Peru, India and South Africa, have done the same, and foreign investors are now flocking back to all of them.
As for Mexico itself, the peso has stabilized at around 6 to the dollar, from near 8 at the height of the crisis. Interest rates are down from 100 percent to 60 percent. In the first quarter of this year Mexico ran a $165 million trade surplus, versus a $4.3 billion deficit the same period a year ago. Its exports were up 33 percent -- all signs that the Government's new policies are working.
But that's also Mexico's problem. The rescue plan is working. It is putting the Mexican people through a brutal recession, like wiring someone's jaw shut to lose weight. With 500,000 newly unemployed, the potential for a social explosion remains very high. On the finance side, the main problems are banks, banks, banks. There are a lot of Mexicans with variable-rate mortgages who cannot repay at the current high rates, so the banks are carrying huge amounts of bad loans. The potential for bank runs, or for the Government to have to prop up banks with cash and create more inflation, is still real. Until foreigners are assured that Mexico's inflation is under control, it is unlikely they will return in large numbers and the Government will still need to draw bailout funds.
Still, President Clinton's decision to rescue Mexico was the largest non-military international commitment by America since the Marshall Plan. It was done without Congressional or public support, because it meant bailing out some U.S. speculators as well. But what Mr. Clinton understood was that it was important to rescue Mexico -- not because a few big American investors would be helped by it, but despite the fact that a few big American investors would be helped by it. Because the issue was never just Mexico, but the stability of the global system.
Of course, some reckless populists like Senator Al D'Amato advocated doing nothing. But as bankers will tell you, it was that sort of shortsighted thinking that made the Great Depression "Great."
No, if this works, the Mexico bailout could go down as the least popular, least understood, but most important foreign policy decision of the Clinton Presidency.
But this is not that column. This is the column just before that column.

HEADLINE: Dole and Gramm: At Play in the Field of Budgets

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
At a passing glance, it may appear that the Senate's 100 members have spent most of the week debating a plan to balance the Federal budget. In fact, maybe 46 of them have. The other 54 -- that is to say, the Republicans -- have been watching a race for President.
The contestants are Senators Bob Dole of Kansas and Phil Gramm of Texas, the early leaders among Republican Presidential aspirants, and their field of battle has been that chestnut of Republican political issues, cutting taxes. Mr. Dole, the front-runner, says he wants to. Mr. Gramm, playing catch-up, says he wants to more, much more. Mr. Dole says he wants to just as much as Mr. Gramm. And so on. 
 This dance for political advantage has played on and off the Senate floor all week, elbowing aside an eye-glazing budget debate whose outcome was long preordained anyway. The blunt truth is that the Dole-Gramm jousting is the main event by default, but it is still worth watching.
A week of back-and-forth over the tax-cut issue has cast in relief the personalities and political skills and flaws of the two men: Mr. Dole, the cagey, tight-lipped tactician; Mr. Gramm, the battering ram who disdains tactics for the brute force of argument.
As if it were needed, it has also underscored the clout of the those on the Republican new right, the Gingrich wing of the party for whom tax cuts are not just a platform plank, but the foundation.
Mr. Gramm has their hearts, but needs to persuade them that he can outpoint Mr. Dole and win the party's 1996 nomination for President. Mr. Dole looks like a winner, but needs to persuade them that he has their interests at heart.
For Mr. Dole, this is no easy task. For one thing, he is majority leader in a Senate whose Republicans are, by and large, far less radical than the Gingrich acolytes, and he cannot appease the right without risking the loss of his colleagues' support in legislative battles to come. For another, he has a record of Republican-style moderation that he cannot shed without appearing to the nation at large to be unprincipled.
Mr. Gramm, on the other hand, has little to lose by courting the activist conservatives who are a real force in the early months of a Presidential campaign.
"Phil Gramm is playing to the Republican primary voter," Kenneth M. Duberstein, former chief of staff to the patriarch of tax-cutters, President Ronald Reagan, said the other day. "He's not worrying about the general election. Bob Dole is worrying about both."
The field for this contest has been the Senate's budget blueprint, the document in which Republicans have shown in rough terms how they intend to move the nation to fiscal balance in seven years. The House version of this document makes additional reductions in spending to accommodate a raft of tax breaks, for businesses and individuals, that is expected to total $350 billion by 2002.
The Senate version, drafted by Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the Budget Committee chairman and Mr. Dole's close ally, held out the prospect of a tax cut -- but only later, after a balanced budget is locked into law. And it suggested that any cut should be limited to $170 billion, the amount some economists say the Government could save if a balanced budget led to lower interest rates and lower finance charges for Federal borrowing.
Perhaps sensing a chance to highlight his ideological differences with Mr. Dole, Mr. Gramm decided weeks ago to make the tax issue a battleground. He made it known that he would try to attach a House-sized tax package to the Senate budget proposal, paid for with deeper savings in Federal programs like Medicaid.
In Green Bay, Wis., last weekend, he told Midwest Republicans that Mr. Dole showed no commitment to lower taxes despite a promise by the Senate's Republicans in last fall's campaign. "We have some Republicans who have one foot firmly implanted in the dramatic change we committed to," Mr. Gramm said, mentioning no one by name, "and they have the other foot firmly implanted in business as usual in Washington. This week, they are going to have to pick one of those feet up."
Mr. Gramm's plan, which he proposed on Monday, cut taxes for families, retirees, small businesses and others by $300 billion, omitting only a few of the breaks in the House tax proposal. In truth, it stood no chance of passing the cautious Senate, where a body of Republicans opposes cutting taxes at all until the budget is on the way to balance.
But an effect of it was to put Mr. Dole on the hook, and, for a long while, he seemed to wiggle between the Republican right and the moderates he represents as majority leader.
Mr. Dole repeatedly promised that the Senate's final budget would include a tax cut, but he did not say how large it would be, whom it would benefit or when it might be enacted. Asked outright whether he supported Mr. Domenici's no-tax-cut-now stance, he said drily, "I haven't talked to Mr. Domenici about that."
There were rumors, then sightings, of Republicans closeted in Mr. Dole's office, trying to hash out a compromise tax plan that would appease both Mr. Gramm and the majority leader.
Mr. Dole refused to confirm such sightings. "If they want to see me, they know where to find me," he said of the negotiators.
Mr. Gramm, in a speech on the Senate floor, rejected bargaining. "I know there are others talking about cutting deals, compromising," he said caustically, again mentioning no names.
If the United States is to take a new course, he said, "we've got to stop cutting deals in Washington."
On Thursday, the moment of truth arrived, and Mr. Gramm's proposal came to a vote. It lost by an unexpectedly large margin, 31 to 69. Twenty-three of the 54 Republicans opposed it.
Mr. Dole voted for it.
"I think it has possibilities," he said, without elaboration.
On record in support of Mr. Gramm's plan, but unencumbered by it, Mr. Dole now appears ready to support an alternative filed late today by one of the negotiators, Senator Rod Grams of Minnesota. The plan would effectively follow Mr. Domenici's dictates, allotting $170 billion for tax relief over seven years. But first, the Congressional Budget Office would have to certify that that $170 billion was actually materializing.
Republican aides said Mr. Dole would speak on the Senate floor on Friday, advocating that the money be devoted to a $500-per-child tax credit for most families, lower capital-gains and estate taxes and a new individual retirement account for spouses.
"Dole came out of this fine," one Republican senator said today. "He covered his rear."
Mr. Gramm begged to differ. A "cut-a-deal, kiss-your-sister kind of compromise," he said.

Europe Warns of Trade Suits On Car Quotas

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 24

 BODY:
Fearing they might be cut out of a deal on auto imports, European officials warned Japan and the United States today that they would sue both countries if the Japanese agreed to demands to set numerical targets for increased imports of American cars.
It was the most aggressive step to date by the Europeans, who have condemned the plan by the Clinton Administration to impose punitive tariffs of 100 percent on 13 Japanese luxury cars as a violation of world trade rules. 
 The warning came as the American Secretary of Commerce, Ronald H. Brown, acknowledged that the United States was unsure of its legal standing in such threats of trade retaliation. Mr. Brown said at a briefing with reporters here that Government lawyers had given mixed opinions to the Administration on whether its intention to increase tariffs on Japanese cars was legal under the new world trade agreement adopted last year.
The Clinton Administration has demanded that Japan force open its automotive markets and set a figure for increased American auto sales by June 28 or it will impose the sanctions, effective last Saturday.
Some trade experts noted that the world trade agreement set tariff levels for automobile imports and said that any increase would blatantly violate the accord.
"We believe such numerically denominated imports amount to managed trade and would violate international trade rules," Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's chief trade official, said today. "And we would give very serious consideration to taking action against such an agreement" at the World Trade Organization, he said.
Sir Leon's warnings, delivered to Japan on behalf of the 15 countries of the European Union, came on the second of a tense two-day meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development here.
The American plan to impose $6.5 billion in new tariffs on Japanese luxury cars in retaliation for Japan's closed-market system has overshadowed other debate at the meeting.
The threat by European officials places them in the middle of the auto trade debate. It underlines the level of European frustration with tactics that amount to a threat of a trade war, just a few months after 124 nations had signed an agreement meant to settle such disputes through a system centered at the World Trade Organization in Geneva.
Japan welcomed today's statement by the European Union, its officials said, as it amounted to support for its position against the United States in their increasingly heated trade dispute.
Though there was little disagreement that Japan's markets were not fully open to foreign competition, almost every member of the O.E.C.D., an organization of 25 of the world's richest nations, was visibly upset over plans by the United States to take action on its own against Japan and not let the matter rest with the World Trade Organization.
Clinton Administration officials asserted that after two days of talks with fellow O.E.C.D. members, they had gained support. But others here said no other country was willing to support the use of sanctions against Tokyo.
Japan pushed hard to include language that explicitly condemned the use of unilateral trade actions in the meeting's final statement, and officials here said that all the O.E.C.D.'s nations supported the Japanese position except the United States.
But it was the United States' threat that it would not agree to the final communique, and Japan's willingness to avoid outright confrontation, that kept the language out of the document, officials said.
Numerical targets are hardly a new concept in Japanese-American trade relations. Indeed, during the Bush Administration, an agreement was reached that set target levels on imports of American-made auto parts. But since the new round of negotiations with the Clinton Administration began two years ago, Japan has been resisting that idea.
"We cannot force Japanese auto dealers to sell American cars," said Atsushi Oi, director of the automobile industry division of the Japanese trade ministry, the top-ranking Government specialist brought here to persuade Europeans that Japan had tried to open its markets to American cars and that the problem was that American auto makers had made only paltry efforts to gain a greater share of the Japanese market. "We cannot do any more."
In the end, much of the wrangling centered on the interpretation of numbers. Japanese trade officials, for instance, said that American auto makers were selling only two cars with steering wheels on the right side -- the standard in Japan -- so how could the Big Three expect to sell more cars.
American officials said such arguments were bunk, that Detroit had 10-right hand drive models but could not get the cars into Japan.
"If you don't have dealerships and can't get the cars into the country, how can you sell cars," a senior American official said.

HEADLINE: Gerry Adams and Briton Discuss Ulster Peace in Washington

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
Gerry Adams, the political leader of the Irish Republican Army, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the British Secretary for Northern Ireland, met for the first time today to discuss the peace effort in Northern Ireland.
The meeting lasted 30 minutes in Sir Patrick's sixth-floor suite at the Sheraton Washington Hotel. Mr. Adams said the meeting was "very useful, frank and friendly and positive." He added, "We understand each other's position." 
 Asked if he could "do business" with Sir Patrick, Mr. Adams answered, "Absolutely." The two men shook hands, but not in sight of photographers. Mr. Adams added that the meeting had "moved the full situation forward."
Sir Patrick was less sanguine about the meeting, which he described as "civil." He said he had urged Sinn Fein to try again to persuade the I.R.A. to begin decommissioning its arsenal, but said he did not get a positive response from Mr. Adams. "I won't negotiate with a party associated with a paramilitary organization that won't give up its arms," Sir Patrick said.
Officials and experts said this meant that there was still a long way to go before the British Government would allow Sinn Fein to take part in full-fledged peace talks.
The meeting was expected to clear one of several obstructions to the peace moves that have been advancing sporadically since the I.R.A. declared a cease-fire last Aug. 31. Mr. Adams had been demanding a meeting with Sir Patrick for months, arguing that the Secretary, the ranking official in the British province of Ulster, was in contact with other parties involved, including Protestant unionists, mainstream Roman Catholics and the Irish Government.
Sir Patrick had delayed contact with Mr. Adams because he wants assurances from him that Sinn Fein is ready to discuss ways to decommission the I.R.A. arsenal, estimated at 100 tons of weapons.
The meeting came at the start of a White House-sponsored conference on trade and investment in Ireland, which President Clinton promised last year as part of his attempt to foster peace in Northern Ireland.
The talks at the Sheraton Washington upstaged the economic aspects of the conference, which Mr. Clinton, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown and a number of American business executives are scheduled to address on Thursday.
"For the first time representatives of all Ireland, not only political but from the community, are meeting under the same roof," said John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party in Northern Ireland, whose secret talks with Mr. Adams two years ago led to the revival and acceleration of the peace effort. "Given that we're all prepared to sit down and talk about jobs, it shouldn't be too hard to sit down to talk about lives."
He said that Sir Patrick, having met with Mr. Adams, should now agree to permit Sinn Fein to take part in full-fledged peace talks, including all the Protestant and Catholic parties and the British and Irish Governments. Such talks are Sinn Fein's main demand. But officials and independent experts say that there will be no all-party talks until the arms issue is resolved.
The meeting today gave Sinn Fein the important recognition it wanted, showing that political negotiations, as distinguished from the I.R.A. campaign of violence, had attained for Mr. Adams a meeting of equals with Sir Patrick.
Some Irish and British officials said the meeting was pressed on the British by the White House, which wants the peace negotiations to move faster.

HEADLINE: Long War Turns Liberia Into Core of a Spreading Blight

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia

 BODY:
Nearly every street of this city bears the marks of the five-year-old conflict in Liberia. Medical clinics have been stripped of their roofs. Government ministries, dark and looted shells, are crowded homes to squatters.
In the countryside, instead of merely being the theater of constant small-scale skirmishes between poorly armed peasants, one village after another has been leveled and inhabitants slaughtered by the heavy firepower of tribally based militias that mark their territory with the skulls of their victims. 
 If regions can be likened to neighborhoods, few would dispute that Liberia has been the eyesore of West Africa. While many countries in the region have made unparalleled strides toward democracy and economic reform in the last few years, the blight of Liberia's crisis has also spread.
"There are ever more cross-border incidents in the Ivory Coast," a Western diplomat said here. "You've got a major refugee crisis in Guinea, and as far away as Mali now we are seeing a wave of armed robberies using Liberian weapons."
Of all the countries in the region, however, none has been more affected than Liberia's western neighbor, Sierra Leone. Shortly after the Liberian rebel leader Charles Taylor invaded his country from the Ivory Coast in 1989, he helped spawn a copycat movement next door.
Now, after an increasingly intense yearlong drive that has resembled a scorched-earth campaign, Sierra Leone's rebels, led by a shadowy former army photographer named Foday Sankoh, are camped on the doorstep of the capital, Freetown, and stand far closer to their goal of power than does Mr. Taylor.
In both cases, experts on this region readily identify the factors behind the political decay. First, in Liberia, as in Sierra Leone, years of misrule and economic hardship created a desperate yearning for change. Next, neighbors began to take advantage of each country's weakness, exploiting resources in exchange for cash and arms.
"Had our neighbors not permitted their borders to be used for the arms trade, we would never have had this problem," said David Kpormankpor, chairman of the Council of State, Liberia's governing body.
Additionally, analysts say, the failure of the West to respond adequately has encouraged others to meddle. Diplomats say Libya and its leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, have been the most active and puzzling troublemakers.
"In the 1980's, Qaddafi began looking for interesting characters in the region, helped them get set up and has maintained contact with them," a Western diplomat said. "This provided him with a way to take a slap at the Americans, a slap at the French and a slap at the British, without really leaving fingerprints."
Recently, diplomats say, Colonel Qaddafi has received visits from Mr. Taylor and Burkina Faso's President, Blaise Compaore. For years, diplomats have complained that Mr. Compaore has funneled arms and logistical support to Mr. Taylor, and, many now suspect, to Mr. Sankoh of Sierra Leone. These leaders share military tactics or pasts, and a vague leftist or nationalist oratory.
Some of the fighters in Mr. Sankoh's group, the Revolutionary United Front, are known to have received training in Libya, and diplomats say Mr. Sankoh maintains contact with Colonel Qaddafi.
"What we are seeing is a Libyan move to extend its influence throughout West Africa by reaching out to young, ambitious leaders who have been frozen out by the West or otherwise frustrated," a European analyst said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Pressing China Hard to Maintain Democracy in Hong Kong

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 24

 BODY:
Signaling heightened interest in Hong Kong's future, American officials have issued their boldest warnings yet to China over its future treatment of the British colony when it reverts to Chinese sovereignty in two years.
The warnings have provoked a wave of denunciations from Beijing-controlled newspapers here. 
 In a blunt statement by the United States Consul General and in comments by Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, Washington has expressed its apprehensions over excessive control of Hong Kong's economic and social freedoms.
"What we're saying," Mr. Lord said during a brief visit to Hong Kong over the weekend, "is, we have a strong interest in the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong."
The strengthening of attitudes on Hong Kong comes at a time of growing concern here over how China will govern the territory. The local press is full of articles about the future of the legal system, threats to freedom of the press and the outlook for democratic politics.
This toughening also comes as the Clinton Administration has decided to grant a visa to Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, a decision that Beijing greeted with a barrage of hostile pronouncements.
In setting forth Washington's objectives in Hong Kong, the Consul General, Richard Mueller, emphasized that the United States wants a continuation of Hong Kong's autonomy, the flourishing of its free-market economy, a firm commitment to the rule of law, the protection of human rights and the development of democratic institutions.
Mr. Mueller emphasized the continuation of Hong Kong's autonomy, which is set forth in the Basic Law, a Beijing document that stipulates China's policies toward Hong Kong.
"The continuation of this promised high degree of autonomy is a key factor in the future of Hong Kong's international position, and in the future of U.S.-Hong Kong relations specifically." Mr. Mueller said. "U.S. interests focus particularly on the rule of law and the protection of civil liberties."
China and Britain, whose lease on Hong Kong expires in 1997, are deeply divided over setting up a Court of Final Appeal, which is to be the highest court. The impasse has become increasingly worrying for businesses seeking protection of contract and property rights.
Mr. Mueller's remarks, earlier this month, drew an immediate and stinging retort from Beijing-controlled newspapers, which accused him of interfering in the British-Chinese talks and of collaborating with the British Governor, Chris Patten, who is routinely demonized in the pro-China press.
"It is inappropriate for a U.S. Consul General in Hong Kong to utter the above mentioned remarks," Wen Wei Po declared in an editorial, "quoting out of context and siding with Chris Patten in his policy to confront China and stir up trouble in Hong Kong."
Increasingly throughout the year, Beijing has attacked American statements on Hong Kong.
A State Department report in April surveyed American interests in Hong Kong and firmly supported efforts by Mr. Patten to expand democratic institutions, especially the legislature. China has said it will abolish any democratic structures created before 1997.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman in Beijing, Chen Jian, described the report as "irresponsible" and "interference" in China's internal affairs. "The Chinese side would like to express our strong displeasure," he said.

HEADLINE: Brazil's Former President Can't Seem to Make Up His Mind

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, May 17

 BODY:
As President of Brazil until last December, Itamar Franco displayed an indecisiveness that was the despair of the nation. Out of office, his dithering over a plush diplomatic post has become mass entertainment.
In Bolivia, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela, former Presidents are battling lawsuits or court trials. Here, in Latin America's largest country, Mr. Franco has been agonizing over what most consider a soft landing -- his appointment by his successor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, as Ambassador to Portugal, Brazil's former colonial power. 
 When he was in office, the soft-spoken Mr. Franco was a reluctant President, often offering to resign. But since his diplomatic appointment, he seems to have been looking for excuses to avoid leaving the bright lights of Brasilia, the capital.
"Perhaps nostalgic for the spotlight, he insists on remaining on the stage," Mauricio Dias, a newspaper columnist, wrote recently.
Although sending political rivals into golden exile as ambassadors is a longstanding Latin American custom, Mr. Franco seemed a curious choice for an ambassador because of his limited diplomatic skills. As President, he routinely ducked official receptions and dinners by staying in his hotel room. Averse to overseas travel, he offended the Portuguese by canceling official visits to Lisbon twice at the last minute.
Mr. Franco took three months to accept the ambassadorship. When he did, Brazil's Senate responded with unusual speed, unanimously approving the nomination in March without debate.
He sent his clothes and butler on to Lisbon, but since then has jumped at every opportunity to avoid following.
First, Mr. Franco made it known that he had taken offense when Brazil's Foreign Minister, Luiz Felipe Lampreia, failed to greet his former boss at the door of the Foreign Ministry when he came to discuss his appointment. Then Mr. Franco's girlfriend, June Drummond, announced that she would not go to Lisbon with him unless he married her. Initially, he seemed inclined to do that, and the Supreme Court completed in record time its ratification of Ms. Drummond's 1994 divorce in the United States.
Then it appeared that the 63-year-old politician had cold feet about marrying Ms. Drummond, a teacher half his age. No wedding date has been set.
As he has lingered in Brazil, the former President has repeatedly broken a vow of political silence he took when his term ended.
When a federal judge criticized a labor accord reached by Mr. Franco while President, he called the judge "an ignoramus." But the harshest outburst came when Clovis Carvalho, Mr. Cardoso's chief of staff, charged that Mr. Franco had derailed a privatization program.
"Let's hope that this citizen understands historical and political facts better and that he shuts his mouth," Mr. Franco wrote recently in a telegram sent first to President Cardoso and then to newspapers.
Referring to the plan to reduce inflation that went into effect during his presidency and that was based on a new unit of currency, the real, he added, "One day history will show my participation in your presidential candidacy -- approving, endorsing, and supporting the Real Plan."
In response, Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, a conservative Senator and former ally, belittled the former President. "To this day, the ex-President doesn't understand the Real Plan," he said. "He did everything so that the plan would not work."
After this broadside, Mr. Franco kept silent. Through friends, he hinted that he might fly to Lisbon after all.

HEADLINE: Charitable Giving Rose 3.6% in 1994, Philanthropy Trust Says

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Charitable giving in the United States rose by 3.6 percent last year to $130 billion, just slightly ahead of inflation, according to figures made public yesterday by the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel's Trust for Philanthropy. After inflation, the gain amounted to six-tenths of 1 percent.
At a time when Speaker Newt Gingrich and other government officials are calling for charity to replace government aid in some functions, these figures provide little evidence of any surge in charitable giving, either by individuals or corporations. 
 "There is a big question about how much our nonprofit sector can absorb," said Ann E. Kaplan, research director for the association, which gathers these figures annually.
Giving by individuals, which accounts for about 80 cents out of every dollar given to charity in the United States, was up by eight-tenths of 1 percent after inflation, or slightly more than giving over all. Giving by foundations, which accounts for almost 8 cents of every dollar given to charity, was also up slightly after inflation. But giving by corporations, which accounts for just under 5 cents of every charitable dollar, fell by 2 percent after inflation.
Officials of the philanthropy trust said, however, that they believe corporations are contributing in other ways that do not necessarily get counted.
Ms. Kaplan said the increase in giving last year probably grew out of the improving economy and in people's confidence in their own future.
Not all areas of giving showed gains, however. Giving to human services and to arts, culture and humanities, two sectors that are expected to be hit hardest by local, state and Federal budget cuts, declined on a real basis last year, after inflation.
Charitable donations in all other areas of giving showed an increase after inflation, including donations to religious causes (up 1.4 percent), education (up 5.3 percent) and health institutions (up 3.3 percent).
International affairs, a relatively small area of giving by Americans, showed the biggest gain, to $2.2 billion, for an increase of 15.3 percent after inflation. That is up sharply from the $900 million given for international affairs in 1987, the year the association began to track that type of giving as a separate category.
Environmental and wildlife groups and public benefit organizations like those involved in civil rights and community development also showed gains of nearly 8 percent after inflation last year.
One question in philanthropic circles now is whether the problems stemming from the bankruptcy of the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy will discourage giving by other potential donors.
Helmer Ekstrom, president of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel, an association of consultants to charitable groups, said the New Era situation could lead some potential donors to raise questions about whether charities were handling their donations responsibly. But he added that he believed most charities would be able to convince their donors that "they are minding the store and taking good care of the gifts they get."
Members of the association were also optimistic that the New Era problems would have only a minor impact on giving.
"The Aramony-United Way affair was quite damaging to giving," said J. Patrick Ryan, the association's chairman. "Some nonprofit groups made some mistakes, but they were in good company. This is not a matter of malfeasance by executives running the nonprofits, except for bad judgment."

HEADLINE: China Takes Its Own Way in World Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
William Safire's "China's 'Four Fears' " (column, May 22) contains four errors: 
 (1) Inflation in China is declining. April inflation fell to 18 percent, the sixth consecutive monthly decline. It did not rise to 20 percent, as Mr. Safire implies. The "average Chinese" may have many economic worries, but a fear that "half of what he saves disappears after four years" because of inflation is not one of them. His savings account receives an "interest rate subsidy" on top of the normally earned interest, calculated to compensate for increase in the price level.
It is questionable whether China's gradual lifting of its prices to world price levels can be called "inflation." The national currency has been steadily appreciating against the United States dollar in the last 15 months, and the income of wage and salary earners is growing faster than prices rise. Last year, the national savings rate topped 50 percent of gross domestic product.
(2) There is no such thing as "workers' fear of underemployment" in China. There is fear among "underemployed workers" in archaic sectors of the economy that they may lose their patronage appointments to more productive competitors. Many among those who "migrate eastward" do so by abandoning dead-end employment in order to seek more productive and rewarding opportunities.
Moreover, in the last half-year, large-scale migration of investment capital inland has been spreading these opportunities beyond the "prosperous coast."
(3) Farmers' land is not "encroached on by industrialization." Farmers themselves are selling their appreciated land for profit and are going into business. Farmers do not "now prefer" to sell to local entities and black markets. They have always preferred to do so, and this preference was unfettered by Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 1978 and constituted the backbone of China's free-market reforms.
(4) What dominates in Beijing these days is not fear of "some expression of the people's disgust at pervasive corruption." What dominates is the tactic of the reformers, centered around an effort to impose congressional supervision over party and government, thereby channeling "the people's disgust at pervasive corruption" into successful campaigns against party hacks who impede free-market reforms.
Mr. Safire's charge that the economic chief, Zhu Rongji, has reverted to "regulation" and "central control" is misleading.
His most notable measure of "central control" in the last year has been to introduce central banking and a unified financial market against the opposition of corrupt provincial political machines.
It will do us no good to misread what 1.2 billion people are up to. Nor will it do us any good to try and alter their course by "using our market muscle to encourage freer enterprise." China's reformers started encouraging freer enterprise for their own national strategic reasons some 17 years ago -- before anyone in the West had any inkling that such a thing was possible.
China's largest trading partner is not the United States, and some 85 percent of all foreign investments into the country come from wealthy overseas Chinese. Japan, the largest among the non-Chinese foreign investors, is also China's largest trading partner.

HEADLINE: Letter Grades Flunk The Evaluation Test

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "A's Aren't That Easy" (Op-Ed, May 17): 
 It has always been my impression that grade inflation had already begun by the early 1970's. Thus, I am not surprised there has been little change since then. It would be more useful to compare today's grades with those from 30 years ago, when C's and D's were allegedly more common than today.
I hope that widespread attention to this phenomenon reflects an emerging appreciation of the inadequacy of letter grades as a system of academic evaluation. In the last two decades I have had experience with both letter-grade and narrative evaluation systems, as undergraduate and graduate student, college professor, employer and, now, mother of a school-age child.
From all these perspectives, I have found letter grades deceptive and uninformative.
Narrative evaluations provide the rigorous and useful details that parents, admissions committees, employers and the students themselves need: the strengths and weaknesses of all aspects of student work, including exams, papers and research projects, oral and written skills, creativity, mastery of the subject, consistency of performance.
Narrative evaluation systems have been sustained at colleges and universities (notably the University of California at Santa Cruz), and are becoming widespread in private and public schools.

HEADLINE: Raytheon Can't Complain About Electric Rates

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Corporate dissembling reached a new level in the declaration by a senior executive of the Raytheon Company, likening his Massachusetts-based company to helpless sheep because regulations compel it to buy costly power from in-state utilities (Business Day, May 18). 
 Raytheon itself may be the biggest single cause of its high electric rates. A Raytheon subsidiary, United Engineers & Constructors, designed the $6 billion Seabrook nuclear plant, collecting $1 billion in engineering fees, much of it from Massachusetts utilities that own a large chunk of the grossly expensive plant. United Engineers & Constructors was also a prime cheerleader for Seabrook, declaring it essential to the regional economy, and for nuclear power in general, trumpeting its illusory cost-effectiveness in a dozen government-paid studies over two decades. By all means, let Raytheon shop around for cheap power, but let it first make reasonable reparations for helping to create the predicament it now decries.

Bonds Rise and Yields Drop On New Signs of Slowdown
Bond prices surged and their yields fell sharply after a Government report showed a drop of 4 percent in orders in April, convincing some investors that the Fed's next move would be to lower interest rates.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 6.74 percent, its lowest level in nearly 15 months. [Page D20.] 

Stocks closed mixed after drifting for much of the day. The Dow industrials edged higher to 4,438.16, up 1.72 points. [D10.]
 
Europeans Threaten Trade Suit If Japan Accepts U.S. Car Quotas
European officials, fearful of being cut out of any deal on auto imports, warned Japan and the U.S. that they would sue both countries if the Japanese agreed to set numerical targets for increased imports of American cars. The aggressive step followed European condemnations of American tariffs. [A1.]
 
Salomon's Loss, Merrill's Gain
Sheldon Epstein, who invented the indexed-amortizing swap, is leaving Salomon after less than a month to rejoin Merrill Lynch. [D2.]
 
Sprint Alliance Hits Snag
Sprint's attempt to form an alliance with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom hit another obstacle when the European Union's commissioner for competitiveness criticized the $4.2 billion deal's joint venture. [D3.]
 
Insiders Work on Securities Bill
The Senate Banking Committee is to begin work on securities legislation today that could save businesses and securities firms billions of dollars by making it harder for investors to sue. Critics contend the firms had too much say in crafting the bill. Two top Senate aides who worked on it have accepted jobs in the industry. [A1.]
 
California to Seek Low-Cost Power
The California Public Utilities Commission recommended the creation of an agency to buy power for the state's utility customers from the lowest-cost producers. [D4.]
 
Voting Begins on Phone Bill
The House Commerce Committee began voting on provisions of a bill to overhaul the nation's communications laws, but put off the most volatile issues until today.[D3.]
 
One Orange County Case Dismissed
The bankruptcy judge handling the Orange County, Calif., fund collapse ordered a dismissal of the investment pool's bankruptcy case, but not that of the county itself. [D2.]
 
Bogus Parts Used for Aircraft
The F.A.A. told a Senate subcommittee that bogus parts were common on airliners because of greed by suppliers and weak Government oversight. Several witnesses said inspectors were lax. [A18.]
 
Matsushita Warns of Loss
Matsushita Electric said its earnings more than tripled, to 90.5 billion yen, or $1.02 billion, for the last fiscal year, but the Japanese company warned that it would lose about $730 million next year because of its $1.9 billion loss on the sale of MCA to Seagram. Matsushita said that on a pretax basis, it would still remain profitable. [D6.]
 
Chairman Quits Embattled Ayer
A battle for control of N. W. Ayer erupted publicly with the unexpected announcement that Steve Dworin, the agency's chief was leaving after only 13 months. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D8.]
 
Computer Use Among Blacks
A Census Bureau study found that 25 percent of blacks were using computers, compared with 37.5 percent of whites, confirming what black people in the computer industry have suspected: that many blacks are not embracing them as necessary tools. [C1.]

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Skid: A Harder Landing?

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
Evidence mounted today that the economy was cooling faster than the Federal Reserve intended when it doubled short-term interest rates from February 1994 to February 1995.
Orders for long-lasting manufactured goods skidded 4 percent in April, the third consecutive decline, the Commerce Department reported. The drop was the steepest since December 1991 and worse than analysts had expected. Moreover, no big category of durable goods was spared. 
 "Today's report confirms that what little momentum was left in the industrial sector has all but disappeared," said Laurence H. Meyer, a consultant in St. Louis.
Still, analysts generally continued to avoid predicting that the sharp deceleration of the economy would lead to a recession, even though the annual growth rate had probably become slower than the pace of 2.5 percent or so that was widely thought to be the quickest the economy could grow without increasing inflation.
"The picture of a soft landing is still coherent," said David C. Munro, economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in New York. "It's not time to call for the crash truck."
The report today was the latest in a nearly unbroken string of statistics depicting an economy that was slowing sharply from the breakneck pace of late 1994 that the Fed, fearing resurgent inflation, had already begun to counter.
Bond prices surged and long-term interest rates fell to their lowest point in nearly 15 months as the report today reassured investors that any inflationary pressures were abating. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond fell to 6.74 percent from 6.86 percent. [Page D20.]
But stocks gave up almost all their early gains as new concerns emerged about corporate profits. [Page D10.]
The Commerce Department's report on durable goods also showed that shipments of durable goods fell 2.1 percent last month, the first decline since October, while backlogs of unfilled orders declined, by four-tenths of 1 percent, for the first time since August.
Though orders for durable goods are volatile, today's statistics tend to increase the chances that the next move by the Fed will be to cut interest rates, but analysts said it remained unlikely that would come as soon as its next scheduled policy meeting in early July. The meeting on Tuesday of the Federal Open Market Committee, which convenes eight times a year to plot monetary policy, produced no change.
With exports booming, long-term interest rates reduced enough to stabilize the housing sector and payrolls still expanding, the economy may accelerate again after currently swollen inventories are worked off, analysts said.
Still, the figures on durable goods reinforce other evidence of an increasing slowdown. Retail sales and industrial production both fell in April, the latter for the second consecutive month, and gross domestic product slackened in the first quarter, to an annual pace of 2.8 percent, from 5.1 percent in the final three months of last year.
Orders for durable goods -- goods designed to last at least three years -- tumbled $6.5 billion last month, to $156.5 billion, and the Commerce Department revised orders for March to show a decline of two-tenths of 1 percent instead of the advance of five-tenths of 1 percent it had first estimated.
Transportation equipment was the weakest sector in April, down 9.3 percent on slumps in motor vehicles and parts, along with aircraft and aircraft parts. That followed a decline of 2.9 percent in March and was the third fall so far in 1995.
Industrial machinery and equipment tumbled 4.2 percent, its first decline since December, electronic equipment fell 3.4 percent and primary metals were lower by 1.8 percent, the fourth consecutive monthly decline.
Perhaps most sobering, some analysts said, was the fact that capital goods, one of the few areas of persistent vigor this year, reversed course and fell 8 percent over all, 5.2 percent when military items are excluded and 4.9 percent without military goods or civilian aircraft.
Orders for military equipment alone plunged 24.6 percent, more than wiping out the combined gains of February and March.
"This is the third consecutive monthly decline in orders and it suggests that the second quarter will be quite weak, probably showing a growth rate of 2 percent," Gordon Richards, economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement. "Clearly, the Federal Reserve did the right thing by not raising interest rates yesterday."
For the latest 12 months, orders for durables are now up only 6.2 percent, compared with 11 percent in March and 13.5 percent for the year through April 1994, the report also showed.
The widespread decline in shipments of durables was also paced by transportation equipment, down 4.1 percent, the third consecutive fall. And unfilled orders of transportation equipment have now declined nearly every month since reaching a peak in March 1991, the department said.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
First luxury cars, now bicycles get the trade once-over.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IF Tokyo does not bend, say goodbye to all those sleek Japanese luxury cars. But look on the bright side: You can always buy a bicycle.
Don't bet on it. In what may be interpreted as an effort to cover all bases on the transportation front, the Commerce Department is investigating charges by the American bicycle industry that China is "dumping" bicycles in the United States. If the domestic makers prevail -- and precedent suggests they will -- the prices of all bicycles are likely to go up in time for Christmas. Worse, there will be serious shortages of the high-end bicycles that are the lifeblood of thousands of specialized bike shops. 
 Three American manufacturers (Huffy, Murray and Roadmaster) dominate the domestic industry. And three giant retailers (Kmart, Wal-Mart and Sears, Roebuck), which sell more than a quarter of all bicycles in this country, stock only American-made bikes. But the two other big chains (Toys "R" Us and the Target unit of Dayton Hudson) sell imported bicycles as well as domestic brands.
Imports sometimes cost the retailers less than competitive domestic models in spite of tariffs ranging from 5 to 14 percent. Much of the incentive for selling imports, however, is variety: Toys "R" Us, for example, stocks five times as many models as the price leaders.
All low-price imports come from Asia, which until a few years ago meant Taiwan and South Korea. Rising wages along the industrial Asian rim, however, have led producers to relocate their factories to the Chinese mainland, where the large bicycle industry is fast becoming both a cost and technology leader.
Imports have held a fairly steady 40 percent share of the American market because China's export gains have largely come at Taiwan's expense. Indeed, the indirect cause of the new war on imports is apparently the intense, profit-sapping struggle for market share among the American makers in the wake of Roadmaster's decision to expand production capacity.
But the legal threshold for establishing a "reasonable indication of material injury" from imports is, as a matter of precedent, very low. Hence no jaws dropped last week when the United States International Trade Commission, a Federal agency with close ties to Congress, forwarded the domestic bicycle makers' complaint to the Commerce Department to measure the degree of dumping.
"Dumping" is legally defined as selling below "fair market value," which is usually interpreted as less than cost. Just why private companies would invest in new factories in China in order to sell below cost is a bit of a mystery. Jim Pollock, the bicycle buyer for Toys "R" Us, states flatly that suppliers are "in business to make money." But judging from previous dumping cases, such logic carries no weight at Commerce.
When foreign producers in capitalist countries are accused of dumping, the Commerce Department reconstructs their costs from internal accounting data. But in earlier cases, the department decided, China is a "nonmarket economy," and it is thus likely to use the method of measuring cost preferred by the domestic bicycle makers -- namely, the cost of making similar products in a third country.
To make the Government's job easier, domestic producers have already calculated what it would cost to make Chinese bikes in Indonesia. And -- no surprise -- they find that merely to break even, the Chinese would have to raise prices by 51 to 98 percent, depending on the model.
Mass market retailers are not about to say how they would respond to the imposition of steep punitive tariffs. But industry analysts expect a combination of higher prices, limited selection and spot shortages by Christmas.
The fate of independent bike stores and their customers would be far worse. Specialty stores sell 95 percent of the $200-plus bicycles, most of which are now made in China. Thus, while virtually none of the bikes sold by independents compete with Huffy, Murray and Roadmaster, punitive tariffs "would be devastating to a good number of the 6,500 independent dealers," said Jay Townley, a consultant to manufacturers and retailers of high-end bicycles.
The Commerce Department could still surprise everyone by deciding that Chinese bicycle makers operate in what the law defines as a "bubble of capitalism," and are thus not subject to the most biased methods of calculating punitive tariffs. And even if the department sets very high tariffs, the International Trade Commission could carve out a sanctuary for high-end bicycle makers and their independent retailers, who cannot possibly be injuring the domestic mass-market manufacturers.
But even if Chinese bicycles slip through the cracks in the protectionist wall, the antidumping law will remain an inviting alternative to just about any domestic manufacturer who would rather hire lawyers than cut costs. America's trade laws are written for the benefit of producers and consumers. Stay tuned: you have nothing to lose but your living standard.

D'Amato Leads Attack on Mexican Aid Package

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and a string of Capitol Hill witnesses argued today that the $20 billion rescue package for Mexico was a failure that was being covered up by unrealistic official reports.
"The Mexican Government is taking the American Government for a ride," said Javier Livas, a Mexican businessman and political opponent of President Ernesto Zedillo. "The bailout package has not helped the real economy." 
 Mr. Livas testified before the Senate Banking Committee, which is headed by Senator D'Amato, a leading critic of the Clinton Administration's loan package to Mexico.
Senator D'Amato, the New York Republican, said Mexico's "economy is in shambles" and optimistic accounts of a recovery were misleading. "The financial alchemy is concealing a massive hole in Mexico's banking system," he said.
Economists, business leaders, members of Mexico's political opposition and college professors supported Senator D'Amato's assessment.
A banking committee aide said there were no plans to call Clinton Administration witnesses and it was uncertain if additional hearings would be held.
The Administration insists Mexico's economic crisis is easing, with a sharp reduction in its short-term debt and tough austerity measures.
The United States approved the latest $2 billion installment in loans last week, bringing the total provided Mexico to $10 billion. The money is being used to pay off short-term, dollar-denominated debts.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has said "it is too soon to declare victory" but that Mexico is putting major budget-cutting and revenue-raising measures into effect.
Senator D'Amato disputed the Administration's optimistic assessment, saying Mexico's economy appeared on the verge of collapse because the loans from the United States were only helping wealthy investors redeem their securities.

HEADLINE: Stocks End Mixed, With the Dow Gaining 1.72, to 4,438.16

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stocks closed mixed yesterday, as stock traders wondered whether the latest evidence of an economic slowdown was good news or bad.
After drifting for much of the day and then falling as much as 30 points, the Dow Jones industrial average edged higher to a record 4,438.16, up 1.72 points. And the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.02 point, to 528.61, also a record, while the Nasdaq composite index, rich in the technology stocks that have recently led the market, dropped 1.66 points, to 877.98. 
 Stocks rose for the first 15 minutes of the day in reaction to a Commerce Department report that seemed to reinforce the market's consensus that the economy is slowing, inflation poses little or no threat, and the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates flat or even cut them later in the year.
But the Commerce Department report pointed to such a sharp economic slowdown that some traders began puzzling whether corporate profits would be depressed, meaning they should start selling stocks.
Because of the uncertainty, high-technology stocks, for the first time in weeks, actually dropped sharply, although many rebounded by the end of the day. "In a slowing economy, it becomes harder and harder to make money," thus hurting equities, said Tim Grazioso, manager of Nasdaq trading at Cantor Fitzgerald & Company. When high-tech stocks fell, other stock groups fell, too, Mr. Grazioso said.
The Commerce Department said factory orders for aircraft, cars and what economists call durable goods, declined 4 percent in April. It was the largest drop in more than three years and the third monthly decline in a row.
Wall Street had expected a drop of only half a percentage point, which would have been more in line with March's drop of two-tenths of 1 percent and February's drop of seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Durable goods orders have "declined quite sharply, much more than I thought they would," said Joseph Liro, chief economist for S. G. Warburg & Company.
The drop in American exports to Mexico, caused by the peso crisis, and a big drop in April car sales, Mr. Liro said, mean that the gross domestic product will probably grow only 1 percent or so in the second quarter, compared with growth of 3 percent or more in the first quarter.
Because of the slowing economy, the bond market is betting on a Fed rate cut, bidding down bond yields, lowering borrowing costs and thus deflecting some money to stocks.
Indeed, shorter-term bills, ranging from three months to two years, are now trading below 6 percent, the level of the Federal funds rate that the Fed left unchanged on Tuesday. It is a clear indication that bond traders are anticipating a rate cut later this year.
But unlike other economists, Mr. Liro sees a pickup in the economy in the second half, removing any urgency for the Fed to cut interest rates. "This market has the Fed moving to cut rates no later than the August meeting" of the Fed's policy-making committee, he said. "The Fed is going to be slower on the trigger than that."
Mr. Liro sees stock money staying put, as the bond market underperforms because of the misperception of the Fed's willingness to cut rates. But later this year, he sees more foreign investors moving to buy American stocks, in which they are underinvested in comparison with other assets.
The dollar has stabilized recently, so foreign investors, especially Europeans, are not penalized so much by buying dollar-denominated stocks as they were. The Dow, for example, has risen 15.74 percent in dollars so far this year, 15.02 percent in British pounds and 15.74 percent in French francs, but only 7.47 percent in German marks.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.18 point, to 283.98, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,213 to 1,040. The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.09 point, to 491.77.
Among advancing stocks, United Counties Bancorporation rose 19 1/2, to 147, after Meridian Bancorp agreed to acquire it for $360 million. American International Group, an insurance company, rose 3 3/8, to 116 7/8, after it declared a 3-for-2 stock split and raised its quarterly dividend.
Among declining stocks was Michaels Stores, a home-decorating retailer, which dropped 7 1/2, to 24 3/4, after it warned of lower profits in its second fiscal quarter. The American depository receipts of CBT Group, a software developer in Ireland, fell 5, to 38, after an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons downgraded his assessment from "strong buy" to "buy."
The most active stock, at nearly 9 million shares, was Oracle Systems, a software developer, after a Goldman, Sachs analyst said it might be undervalued.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Slips as Durables Report Stirs Interest-Rate Speculation

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against most leading currencies yesterday after a large decline in American durable goods stirred speculation that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that factory orders for durable goods, manufactured items from air-conditioners to aircraft, fell 4 percent last month, the biggest drop since December 1991. Orders have fallen three months in a row. 
 "The fact that the durable goods report was so bad deterred some dollar buyers," said Betsy Reetz, head of institutional sales at National Westminster Bank in New York.
Also weighing on the dollar was talk that European central banks were selling dollars for marks as part of normal reserve adjustments, currency traders said. Foreign central banks bought dollars on several occasions this year in coordinated efforts to support the value of the dollar, and are now seeking to sell, traders said.
"We heard there were a lot of orders by foreign central banks to sell dollars at the 1.4450 level," said Dave Glowacki, senior currency trader at NBD Bank in Detroit. "That had a major impact on the dollar."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar slipped to 1.4385 marks from 1.4436 marks on Tuesday. The dollar edged up to 87.18 Japanese yen from 87.10 yen.
The durable goods report yesterday, together with other signs of slowing in the United States economy, reinforced the view that the seven rate increases by the Fed since February 1994 had cooled growth enough to keep inflation in check. Some traders have suggested the Fed could lower rates later this year. Lower rates typically hurt the dollar by making deposits denominated in it less attractive.
"The Fed is on hold with a bias toward easing, and the easing could come sooner rather than later," said Karl Halligan, vice president of strategic trading at CIC Bank New York.
The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged after a meeting of its policy-making committee on Tuesday.
A strong rally in the Treasury market, however, muted the negative effects of the durable goods report on the dollar, traders and analysts said. Demand for American stocks and bonds usually bolsters the dollar because foreign investors must buy dollars to buy the securities.
"The report was worse than expected, but dollar fallout is being stifled by the bond market rally," said Kevin Lawrie, manager of foreign exchange trading at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.

HEADLINE: Dole Abandons His Plan For Significant Tax Cut

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, today abandoned any notion that the Senate's budget plan could allow for a substantial tax cut right away.
But the budget plan that comes out of a House-Senate conference committee is almost certain to include a tax cut in some form. So the Senate will have another chance to vote on the issue next month. 
 The final vote on the Senate plan was delayed until Thursday, as Democrats offered dozens of amendments meant mostly for political consumption and demanded votes on all of them.
Most of these amendments were rejected on party-line votes. But the Democrats, joined by 10 Republicans, did succeed in blocking a Republican scheme to abolish taxpayer financing of Presidential election campaigns.
On Tuesday, the Senate voted, 69 to 31, to reject a proposal by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas to include tax cuts of more than $300 billion in its overall plan that is supposed to balance the budget within seven years.
Republicans were split on the issue. Twenty-three of them voted with all the Democrats against the tax cut, including Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Budget Committee, and Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, chairman of the Finance Committee.
Mr. Dole and Mr. Gramm are rivals for the Republican Presidential nomination next year. Mr. Dole voted in favor of the Gramm tax proposal, presumably hoping to cancel any political advantage Mr. Gramm might get for his effort. Mr. Dole has promised all year that the Senate would vote for a tax cut, but he expended no effort to get the Gramm amendment passed.
Looking for solid political footing, Mr. Dole, who normally offers an opinion on every issue in the legislative galaxy, has kept quiet this week about the tax matter. On Tuesday night and again today, he met with Republican colleagues in search of some kind of compromise.
What they decided on was an amendment, to be voted on Thursday, that would require that any money the balanced-budget plan saves the Government in lower interest rates on Government bonds be used for tax cuts.
During the debate, Mr. Dole is expected to enter into an exchange with Mr. Packwood in which they pledge that such tax cuts would involve lower taxes for families with children, a tax break for capital gains and several other items on Mr. Gramm's list.
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that if a balanced budget plan is adopted and adhered to for seven years, the Government will save $170 billion because of lower interest rates. The budget plan now before the Senate would permit this money to be used for tax cuts and would not allow any of it to be spent, but it would not require that taxes be lowered.
In any event, almost none of the money would be available in the first year or two, and the bulk of it could not be used until after the turn of the century.
The scene in the Senate today represented legislative sausage-making at its worst.
By early afternoon, the 50 hours of debate allotted by the budget law had expired. But dozens of amendments had not been voted on. So the Senate took one vote after another without any debate or explanation of what the amendments entailed.
The proposal to block Republicans from stopping Government financing of Presidential campaigns beginning with the election in the year 2000 was approved, 56 to 44. Ten Republicans joined all 46 Democrats in supporting the proposal. All those in favor of scrapping public financing were Republicans. The measure to drop the financing system was put into the budget resolution earlier this month by the Republican majority on the Budget Committee.
The Republican Senators running for President next year were split on the issue. Mr. Dole and Mr. Gramm voted to cancel Federal financing. Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania voted to retain it.
Under one of the campaign finance laws enacted in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, the Federal Government partly finances Presidential primary races and fully finances general election campaigns.
In return for the Government money, candidates can accept only limited private contributions in the primaries and no private donations at all in the general election campaign.
To pay for this, taxpayers can voluntarily check a box on their tax returns that results in $3 going to the campaign fund. It does not increase their taxes, but it reduces the amount of money the Government has available for other purposes.
Scrapping this system has become a pet project of Republicans in recent years. The main reason this has become a partisan issue is that Republicans generally have an easier time raising private contributions than do Democrats.
In next year's campaigns, the Government is expected to spend $60 million to $80 million for primary races, $12 million for each major party's nominating convention and an additional $60 million for each party.

HEADLINE: Government Is Urged to Act Quickly in Protecting Habitats

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
An expert panel convened by the National Academy of Sciences today called on the Government to act more swiftly to protect the habitats of plant and animal species that are found to be in danger of extinction.
When a species is listed under the Endangered Species Act, the group of scientists said, the Government should act on an emergency basis to protect enough of the habitat to stabilize the species' population and guarantee its survival for about 25 years, taking protective steps no matter what the economic consequences. 
 That recommendation flies in the face of critics who are recommending that Congress change the law to give more consideration, not less, to economic factors when writing environmental regulations.
The critics also contend that the law is not being scientifically applied, for example, by trying to protect distinct populations that closely resemble one another. But the report's main conclusion was that the current law was "based on sound scientific principles."
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who supervises the law's enforcement, said many of the report's conclusions supported "exactly what we've been doing for the past two and a half years."
But Henson Moore, head of the American Forest and Paper Association, an industry group, said the report was neither a total endorsement of the law nor a repudiation of an industry-supported bill to revise the law.
The panel, convened in 1992 by the scientific advisory council at the request of Congress, included 17 experts from various disciplines. It was headed by Michael T. Clegg, a geneticist who is dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of California at Riverside.
Calling preservation of habitat the major factor in saving species, the report noted that nearly 80 percent of all the species listed as endangered have not been provided with protected habitat. "Survival habitat" should be provided immediately, it said.
When long-term plans for the recovery of endangered species are drawn up, it said, enough habitat must be set aside to let populations grow to sustainable levels, though in these long-term plans, economic costs may be taken into consideration.
"Because habitat plays such an important biological role in endangered species' survival," the report said, "some core amount of essential habitat should be designated for protection at the time of listing a species as endangered, as an emergency, stop-gap measure. It should be identified without reference to economic impact."
The panel said its conclusions and recommendations were based on purely scientific grounds. It said that subspecies, or distinct populations, like the runs of salmon that migrate along a single stream generation after generation, should be protected because of the genetic diversity they provide.
More fundamentally, the report endorsed the widely held scientific view that human activities have recently brought on a "major episode of biological extinction" comparable to the great extinction 65 million years ago that wiped out the dinosaurs and most other reptiles. The best-known example, it said, is the destruction of tropical rain forests, which harbor enormous biological diversity.
"To sustain a viable future for our descendants," the report said, "we must find ways to preserve both species and ecosystems. The Endangered Species Act is a critically important part of our efforts."
But the panel said this law alone could provide no more than a safety net for maintaining biological diversity. Other measures, such as tax incentives for private conservation, are also needed.
"Any coherent, successful program to prevent species' extinctions and to protect the nation's biological diversity is going to require more enlightened commitments on the part of all major parties to achieve success," the report said.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Whitman Gets to Hear Fans' Plea: Don't Let the Devils Go!

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., May 24

 BODY:
Midway through the first period of tonight's Devil-Penguins playoff game at Byrne Meadowlands Arena, a fan held up a sign that said:
"KEEP DEVILS. SEND NASHVILLE THE YANKEES." 
 Between periods, the door of a luxury suite opened onto a jammed, stifling concourse and New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman stepped out.
"Keep the Devils, Christie!" one fan shouted hoarsely.
"Don't let 'em go!!" screamed another.
"I'm trying," the Governor said, over and over, to fans who had clustered around her, making various pleas to make the Devils happy enough in current lease renegotiations to scotch a potential move to Nashville.
Whitman, whose husband last week brought together officials of the Devils and its landlord at the arena, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, insists that the Devils can be saved from moving.
"All you have to do is look at the crowd tonight," she said. "I've witnessed a continual growth in support of this team. I wouldn't have thought so five years ago or even two years ago."
Although the arena was not sold out, a common problem for the Devils, even during the playoffs, Whitman said, "This is a pretty darned good crowd."
Yet the failure to sell out Byrne Arena is symptomatic of the Devils' existence in New Jersey. Thirteen years after emigrating from Colorado, the Devils, two victories from the Stanley Cup semifinals, are one of the best teams in the National Hockey League. But the team has not captured a significant enough fan base or snared a large enough chunk of the New York market's heart.
It is hockey's local stepchild to the Rangers, the defending Stanley Cup champions, in terms of attendance, attention and corporate cache.
Whereas Rangers fans know tickets at Madison Square Garden are scarce because 15,000 of the 18,200 seats are in the hands of season-ticket holders, those going to Devils games know there will almost always be tickets available because the team has only 10,000 season ticket owners.
And, it's difficult to lure walk-up traffic to Byrne Arena.
The Rangers sold out all 24 home games this year, the Devils sold out six. The Rangers are capable of charging up to $125 for playoff tickets, the Devils charge a high of $60. The Devils have 29 luxury suites, the Rangers 88. The Rangers have sold out their three playoff games, the Devils one of three.
"I'm surprised when they don't sell out the playoffs, but they did when they played the Rangers last year because their fans bought up the tickets," said Laura Steers of Hackettstown, N.J., a 26-year-old veterinarian's assistant.
The Devils admit that they exist within the Rangers' shadow from the east, and compete for some South Jersey hearts with the Philadelphia Flyers. It comes down to whether there really are enough Devils devotees.
"We feel there aren't," said Mike McCall, the Devils' head of marketing and sales. "We have a base of fans. But we think we can grow more."
And McCall admitted that the Devils had for years mistakenly marketed the team as a New York club, not aggressively targeting home-grown fans.
"Dr. McMullen said he felt he was buying a team in the Big Apple," he said, referring to the team's owner, John McMullen. "That's proved not to be the case. North Central Jersey is our primary area."
The Devils have significantly less business support than the Rangers, and the team has not succeeded as well as the basketball Nets, their Byrne co-tenants, in aggressively selling corporate sponsorships.
The Devils are hamstrung as the local area's third team, after the Rangers and Islanders, and even a fourth, the Flyers.
"We're the No. 4 sport, and even Nos. 1, 2 and 3 haven't put three teams in this market," said the N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman. "If I were confronted with putting a third team in this market, I would not have recommended it."
Governor Whitman, who has said she won't go overboard financially to satisfy the Devils, insisted there is a supportive market for the Devil.
"But I don't think the N.H.L. wants three teams," she said.
Whitman's job is to persuade the authority to satisfy McMullen, who believes he has been mistreated financially. Besides believing that the terms of his lease are grossly inadequate, McMullen feels the authority has not always paid everything the team is owed.
McMullen's long-term displeasure with the authority and its president, Bob Mulcahy, has made quite alluring Nashville's offer, which is a virtual giveaway of gate, luxury suite, advertising and concession revenues.
Despite a small rapproachment last week at Whitman's behest, the team and the authority squabbled again this week over a revelation that the authority temporarily suspended the team's lease last December during the N.H.L. lockout. Persons familiar with the situation said the team viewed a letter sent by Mulcahy as unnecessarily provocative and may have meant the possible withholding of revenues, including those from luxury suites.
No other arena owner in the N.H.L. is believed to have done the same thing.
John Samerjan, a spokesman for the authority, said the letter had informed the team that it would reap no revenues for unplayed games. It was rendered moot when the lockout ended. "It was legal necessity," he said. "It was routine and non-threatening." He said no revenues had been withheld.
The Devils have an inadequate lease by the standards of today's sports economics. The team reaps about 35 percent of key luxury suite, concession and parking revenues, well below Nashville's sweetheart offer.
"I'm sick they might move," said Jean Sagarese, 42, a government worker from Mendham, N.J. "I hope it's a bluff."
"The Devils had better stay," said Joe Yander, 40, of Morganville, N.J., who owns a sports novelties business. "It's a con job by the N.H.L."

HEADLINE: 1 State-Federal Tax Collector Is Better Than 2, I.R.S. Says

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
Relief is coming soon for small businesses that fall behind in turning over income, Social Security and other taxes withheld from their employees' paychecks, an Internal Revenue Service official said today.
 Small businesses owing such taxes must typically contend with the competing claims of Federal and state tax collectors, either of whom can file a lien. That can cause an enterprise that is temporarily cash-starved to collapse. 
The I.R.S. now believes, however, that it can increase tax collections and reduce collection costs by coordinating efforts with state tax agencies. Within two years small businesses would need to deal with only one tax collector, who would have authority to negotiate on behalf of both the Federal and state governments.
 To induce states to cooperate, the I.R.S. would forgo its supremacy in collecting the back taxes, and it would split any collections with the states.
 Beverly P. Monaco, the I.R.S. official in charge of relations with state tax agencies, told the I.R.S. Commissioner's Advisory Group at its quarterly meeting here, that a pilot program in San Jose, Calif., involving 200 businesses that were chronically late in submitting Federal and state unemployment insurance taxes had produced dramatic results.
 Businesses default on 50 percent to 75 percent of such agreements, she said, but there have been no defaults in San Jose.
 "The business people involved are very happy," Mrs. Monaco said in an interview. "Business people who had been running from us, and from the State of California, are now coming in, saying they understand they can work out an agreement with both of us."
 The agreements require the businesses to keep all taxes current and to make agreed-upon payments to reduce the back taxes, she said. The payment schedules are tailored to fit the cash flow of each business, she said.
 Mrs. Monaco said that "easily within two years" she expected the I.R.S. to authorize its regional and district offices to sign contracts with state tax agencies to coordinate collection of overdue payroll taxes.
 "We expect tax collections to increase, even though we will split the money with the states, and we expect the expense of collection to go down," Mrs. Monaco said.
 Mary Craig, a former Montana state revenue commissioner who serves on the advisory group, said the I.R.S. was also exploring joint training of Federal and state tax auditors, examiners and collectors. She said the first such training would begin soon in Montana, probably to be followed by joint training in Indiana.
 In another development, a document from an advisory group committee disclosed that the I.R.S. was considering increased record-keeping requirements for all small businesses, even part-time enterprises run from a kitchen table, to reduce the need for tax audits.
 Among the options being discussed, the document showed, are requiring small businesses to keep separate business and family checking accounts and requiring that an annual cash flow statement be submitted to the I.R.S. Mrs. Monaco said that she was surprised to find the disclosure in the document, adding the I.R.S. had not intended to make the proposals public yet.

HEADLINE: A Generation Gap in Venture Capital

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN 

DATELINE: BOSTON, May 24

 BODY:
In his 11 years in the venture capital business, Jonathan Flint found himself becoming more and more frustrated at other people getting rich from all his work. Sure, he earned a six-figure salary, lived in a stylish suburb of Boston and was respected by his peers. But after steering his firm, Burr, Egan, Deleage & Company, through a series of stellar software start-ups -- including a $105 million payback on a $3 million investment in the Powersoft Corporation -- he wanted more.
So, along with two like-minded partners, Mr. Flint is taking a radical step that reflects the new order that is beginning to reshape the clubby world of venture capital. Rather than waiting for the three founding partners of Burr, Egan to hand over the reins and share more of the profits, Mr. Flint is betting that he and his colleagues, Stephen D. Arnold and Terrance McGuire, can do better for themselves by splitting off and seeking investors for a new firm, Polaris Ventures. 
 "This is an old bulls versus young bulls situation," said Mr. Flint, who is 44. "The founders think they are leaving too much money on the table, while the next generation thinks they are taking too much off."
For Burr, Egan, Mr. Flint's exodus represents the end of an era. While the firm, one of the great investment success stories of the last two decades, will not disappear, it has decided not to raise any new funds or invest in new ventures. It will split into three new firms, but members of the former team, including Mr. Flint, will maintain their roles overseeing the firm's earlier investments.
Burr, Egan is not alone. From Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif., home to many of the venture capital partnerships that helped build Silicon Valley, to downtown Boston, where the first venture capitalists got their start after World War II, the business is molting in an unprecedented fashion.
Several blue-chip partnerships are closing as a spate of new operations emerge to carry on the traditional business of venture capital: raising money for young entrepreneurs with great promise and helping shepherd them along until they can sell shares in their companies to the public. And while more venture capital money than ever is now available, several longstanding firms -- Interven Partners in Santa Monica, Calif. is just one -- have decided not to seek new funds. Venture groups within Alex. Brown, the Wall Street investment house, and the Hambros Bank in London, are also retreating. In their place, some veterans of those operations are starting new partnerships like North Bridge Venture Partners in Waltham, Mass.
"There's more turmoil right now with venture partnerships than I've ever seen," said Gib Myers, a general partner at the Mayfield Fund in Menlo Park, who has 25 years of experience in the field.
All this upheaval worries entrepreneurs and the investors who put their money on the line for them.
"This makes our lives very difficult," said Gary Bridge of Horsely, Bridge Partners, an adviser to corporate pension funds and the insurance companies that have increasingly replaced wealthy individuals as the prime sources of risk capital for privately held companies. "This is a people business. The people may not be new to the business but they may be new to working with each other. You never know how the chemistry will be."
Bill Egan, 50,, who presided over the uneasy breakup of the firm he helped start in 1979, acknowledges the risk of abandoning the general-purpose approach of Burr, Egan in favor of the three new organizations with untested leaders at the helm. "We're either going to be real visionaries," he said, "or real idiots who killed the goose that laid the golden eggs."
Much of the turmoil revolves around sharing the rewards of sponsoring successful new ventures.
"There's a younger generation of partners who want theirs and aren't getting it," said Steven P. Galante, editor of Private Equity Analyst, an industry newsletter in Wellesley, Mass.
A survey by the Hay Group, a consulting firm based in Jersey City, found that the average compensation last year for a founding partner in a large venture capital firm was $1.24 million. Senior partners took home an average $770,000, while intermediate partners received $366,000.
But unlike law firms, where younger partners can expect to reap steadily greater rewards as their tenure and status rise within the firm, or Wall Street investment firms, where the best producers tend to receive the greatest compensation, many venture capital partnerships are so closely identified with their founders that they are stumbling over questions of succession and pay.
In Silicon Valley, Merrill Pickard Anderson & Eyre is undergoing a metamorphosis similar to that at Burr, Egan. Steven Merrill, a founding partner, said the structure of most venture capital firms was "not optimal for the normal kinds of promotions and successions." By helping to spin off the firm's younger partners into new funds while they continue to manage Merrill Pickard's existing investments, he said, the elder statesmen might satisfy the Young Turks and still come out ahead.
But others say Mr. Merrill and the other founders brought the breakup upon themselves. "If Merrill Pickard had divided the rewards more equitably, they wouldn't have split up," said one person with knowledge of the industry.
Some founders, critics say, are clinging to the past, when they arranged every deal personally and assumed much of the risk. With younger partners taking lead roles today in many deals, they say, these founders are overreaching by continuing to reap so many of the rewards themselves.
"Today the power is much more distributed," said Robert Kagle, 39, a partner at Technology Venture Investors in Silicon Valley. He is leaving to start Benchmark Partners. "Nobody can claim they are making all the money for the firm."
Not everybody is caught up in the turbulence. Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers in Menlo Park, which has invested in companies ranging from Compaq Computer to the biotech pioneer Genentech, has successfully navigated the transition from one generation of venture capitalists to the next. Its track record is unmatched: the companies in which it has invested now generate a total of $30 billion in annual revenue and employ 30,000 people. The continuity of the firm is a testimony to the lessons that one of its founders, Eugene Kleiner, learned from his experiences at the Hewlett-Packard Company, the Silicon Valley trailblazer that has become a global heavyweight in computers and printers and is now in its third generation of leadership.
As early as 1986, Mr. Kleiner and Thomas Perkins, the other chief founder, set in motion a plan to hand over leadership of the firm to L. John Doerr, a younger partner.
"What it takes is, first, a decision that you want to sustain and build a franchise, which I'm not sure others have made," Mr. Doerr said. "And second, let the best idea win around the table. Hierarchical structures don't work in a stable, healthy partnership. Plus, you generously share the profits."
By going off on their own, though, the up-and-comers of the business are running big risks for themselves and their original firms. The powerful advantage of stability is the reassurance it provides to limited partners, who generally invest for a decade or more in a venture fund. Many have come to expect that the same people will be there to safeguard their investments.
"One of the reasons people make investments is that they know who they are investing with," said Arthur Rock, a venture capital pioneer who now lives in San Francisco. "New faces mean more anxiety."
Many younger partners are tempted to go out on their own in part because the venture capital business is flush with cash these days. According to Private Equity Analyst, $4.3 billion was raised last year, up from $2.9 billion in 1993.
With so much money on hand, funds at the blue-chip firms are oversubscribed, analysts say, leading them to concentrate on the bigger deals available at later stages of financing rather than true start-ups, which are smaller and riskier.
That should provide an opening for the new firms. But T. Bondurant French, a partner at Brinson Partners, an institutional money management firm in Chicago, said he was wary because of the generational upheaval roiling the business. Like many others, Mr. French appears to be sticking with the tried-and-true venture capital outfits, at least for now. "There are certain firms where we have decided not to invest in their latest fund because some of the most talented senior and junior people were leaving," he said.
For now, more money is ending up in fewer hands, leaving the growing number of new firms to fight over the remainder. According to Jesse Reyes, director of Venture Economics Information Services in Boston, 75 percent of the investment money is now controlled by just 40 percent of the venture capital firms. In 1980, that share was spread across 55 percent of the firms.
Indeed, for all the potential rewards, many younger partners are deciding it is safer to stay where they are. Many are handcuffed by existing commitments to companies they helped get off the ground. Others are not ready to walk away from steady incomes and potential future payoffs when their companies go public.
Still, in a business tied so tightly to the entrepreneurial spirit, the lure of starting over is strong. Mr. Flint of Polaris Ventures said the difference between his generation of venture capitalists and the prior one was that he and his peers were much closer to the newer technologies, like the convergence between medicine and software, that will dominate the investment opportunities of the next decade. But he also acknowledged that his group, like the earlier generation that built the business from scratch, was motivated by the same desires for fame and fortune.
"At the end of the day, all we want is to go out and do what those guys did," he said. "We're high on the yearning curve."
 Because of an editing error, the article misstated the total employment of companies in which Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers has made investments. Those companies now employ 100,000 people, not 30,000.

HEADLINE: Investors Still Put Cash Into Stock Funds

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Mutual funds that buy American stocks are continuing to attract a lot of cash from investors, although May's cash flows have been down from April's extraordinarily high levels, fund managers said yesterday.
In April, such funds took in a net $8.6 billion, the highest flow for domestic funds since January 1994, but the cash did not stay in the funds for long. Instead, almost all of it was invested immediately in stocks, according to figures released by the Investment Company Institute, a trade group. 
 The figures showed that domestic mutual stock funds had just 6.8 percent of their assets in cash at the end of April, down from 7 percent in March and the lowest since 1978.
While the money is pouring into stock funds, bond funds are breaking even, at best, in terms of money flow. In April, a net $1.4 billion was withdrawn from bond funds, with most of that coming from funds that invest in municipal bonds.
"In 1994, we had the worst bond market in history, and that is a wound that has not healed yet," said Jack Sharry, a managing director of Putnam Investments. "People have a greater comfort with equities."
At Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund group and a unit of the FMR Corporation, domestic equity funds took in about $1.3 billion this month, a spokeswoman, Marilyn Morrison, said. That was down from $2.5 billion in April, when cash flows were inflated by the deadline for many retirement fund contributions.
April also saw a rebound in cash flow for international stock funds, which invest only outside the United States, and global stock funds, which can invest anywhere in the world. They took in a net $2 billion between them, the best performance since October.
The most extraordinary figures for any class were chalked up by growth funds -- the medium-risk class among diversified funds. Such funds took in $2.8 billion in cash during the month, up from $2 billion in March and the highest for any month since January 1993.
Moreover, the managers of growth funds ended the month with just 6.9 percent of their assets in cash, down from 7.2 percent in March and 10 percent as recently as November. That is lower than in any month for which comparable figures are available, stretching back to 1984.
Mutual funds keep cash on hand to handle redemptions and to guard against declining prices. With money pouring in month after month and stock prices hitting new highs, neither need now seems to be much of a risk.
Among bond funds, junk bond funds have been the only bright spot in attracting money. "People are either expressing confidence about the economy or trying to hold on to yield," said Steve Norwitz, a spokesman for the T. Rowe Price group of funds. In April, such funds took in a net $760 million, raising their total for the first four months of 1995 to $3 billion.
Over the same stretch, municipal bond funds saw outflows of $2.2 billion, government bond funds lost $3.6 billion and mortgage-backed funds had outflows of $2.9 billion.
All cash-flow figures include sales and redemptions as well as transfers among funds in the same family. But they exclude reinvested dividends.

HEADLINE: Cortines Is Conspicuous by His Absence

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

 BODY:
It was billed as a rally to stand up for New York City's schoolchildren and to protest school budget cuts. The teachers' union -- showing a toughened stance against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani -- bused thousands of teachers to City Hall. Some school board members walked across the Brooklyn Bridge with many of the school system's top leaders, a few hundred parents, students and more teachers -- everyone except Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines.
The Chancellor stayed away after issuing statement that said, "I was led to understand that my presence would be interpreted as meaning the rally was against someone or something -- City Hall, or the City Council, or state leaders or whomever or whatever." 
 Although Mr. Cortines did not say so in his statement, his decision to stay away followed a conversation with Deputy Mayor Ninfa Segarra in which she told the Chancellor that the Mayor would consider his participation an affront. Mayor Giuliani said at a news conference that he had not asked her to convey that message.
"We have worked long and hard to forge better working relationships with all our partners in government and I want to preserve that relationship," the Chancellor's statement said.
About 10,000 people attended the rally.
Mr. Cortines's decision to stay away, and his curious explanation of it, illustrated how uneasy his relationship with the Mayor, which has followed a tumultuous two-year course, continues to be. During a confrontation with Mr. Giuliani over budget cuts 13 months ago, Mr. Cortines resigned briefly and then rescinded the decision. Several of the educational leaders who attended the rally said they were puzzled by the Chancellor's decision.
Carol A. Gresser, the Board of Education president who hired Mr. Cortines and is his closest political ally, said she first heard of his decision not to take part when she read the Chancellor's statement yesterday. She expressed some irritation with Mr. Cortines's posture.
"I would have preferred that he join us because I think that we have an important message to deliver," Mrs. Gresser said in an interview at the rally. "I want the Mayor to hear our message, and I'm not tiptoeing around about it."
Sandra Feldman, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, said she was "really disappointed" about the Chancellor's decision.
"This is not a rally against anybody," Ms. Feldman said. "This is not an anti-Giuliani rally. This is a rally to show that there is a large constituency for public education in this city. I think it's appropriate for the leadership of the school system, the Chancellor, the board president, to come out and say to the Mayor and the City Council, 'We want you to make education a priority in your budget.' "
Donald Singer, the principals' union president, said of Mr. Cortines: "I'm disappointed that he's not here since he's the leader of the school system, but we're not leaderless -- we have most of the rest of the city's educators here."
The teachers' union hired 185 buses to transport teachers and parents from the outer boroughs to City Hall for the rally, said Susan Amlung, a union spokesman. Both the teachers' union, which represents 90,000 teachers, guidance counselors and other school employees, and the principals' union, which represents more than 3,000 assistant principals, principals and other supervisors, bought radio time to criticize City Hall's proposed school budget cuts and to urge the rank and file to attend the rally.
Mr. Giuliani, and to a lesser extent Gov. George E. Pataki, were the targets of the rally, although almost none of the speakers mentioned either man by name. Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, whose locals represent cafeteria workers, school aides and other school employees, was one of the few.
"We're saying to Mayor Giuliani and to Governor Pataki that when you take away money from the school system, you kill people, you hurt people," Mr. Hill said.
If most of the rally's speakers seemed reticent to target Mr. Giuliani by name, few of those who marched, chanting slogans and waving placards, showed the same hesitation.
"Gov. Pataki and Mayor Giuliani Hate the Children of New York!" screamed a placard carried by Ann Walter, an unemployed mother of a second-grade student who attends Public School 230 in the Kensington section of Brooklyn.
Two teachers from George Washington High School in Manhattan carried a banner, stretched between two poles, which portrayed a menacing Mr. Giuliani wearing an "I Love NY" T-shirt, but swinging an ax.
"The mayor is a target of a lot of unrest in this city," said Luis Espinoza, a social studies teacher at George Washington High School in Manhattan who helped paint the banner. "People trusted him because he says that he loves the city, but he has cut it apart."
Seeking to close the city's budget gap, City Hall has proposed that the Board of Education's operating budget, which was $8.4 billion during the current fiscal year, be reduced to $8.1 billion for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Because enrollments are rising and there are other increases in operating costs, board officials say City Hall is cutting the budget by $1 billion. City Hall says that it is seeking to cut the budget by only $220 million.
Mr. Giuliani, appearing after the rally on a WCBS radio talk show, took a call from a teacher at John F. Kennedy High School in the Bronx who complained that the city's schools are insufficiently funded. Mr. Giuliani reacted with an angry lecture about waste in the schools.
"Those are the things the teachers should have been out there demonstrating about today," he said. "We have got to be more accountable in spending the first $8 billion. There is no more money in New York City to put in the school system or anywhere else."

HEADLINE: McCall, Citing Pension Fund Payments, Blocks Budget Plan

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 25

 BODY:
The Democratic State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, erected a new roadblock on the path to a budget agreement today by rejecting a plan to save money by lowering the state's scheduled payments to its pension system.
Gov. George E. Pataki said that the rejection represented "a minor setback," and that another plan under consideration to produce the $110 million in savings might not require Mr. McCall's approval. But budget negotiations that had seemed headed for a possible conclusion by this weekend were sidetracked while legislative leaders focused on the pension issue. The budget is now 55 days late. 
 Also today, state officials said that Mr. Pataki had reached tentative agreement with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, and the Senate Republican leader, Joseph L. Bruno of Rensselaer County, on providing financing for 19 stadium projects.
The projects, worth a total of $110.6 million, had been approved as part of the 1994 election-year budget, but many had been recommended for elimination by Mr. Pataki, who questioned their value to economic development. The projects include construction of a deluxe $24 million swimming center in Nassau County for the 1998 Goodwill Games, renovations to Buffalo's hockey arena and construction of minor-league baseball parks around the state.
The agreement would also provide money for new projects in and around Mr. Bruno's district costing $14 million, including improvements at the Albany County Airport and the Saratoga Performing Arts Center.
The state officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said today that the leaders had agreed to pay for the stadium projects and the projects in Mr. Bruno's district by selling Urban Development Corporation bonds rather than using cash from the state's general fund.
The cost of paying off the bonds this year is estimated at $15 million. Of the projects approved last year, only construction of a soccer stadium in Mitchell Park in Nassau County was dropped.
The agreement, which remains subject to negotiations on the larger budget, would also restore $62 million for school construction projects that was appropriated last year, including $42 million for projects in New York City. Mr. Pataki had proposed eliminating that spending, but Mr. Silver made it a priority to restore the money.
As for a larger budget agreement, prospects foundered after Mr. McCall issued his objection today.
Mr. McCall, the sole trustee of the state's $60 billion retirement system, defended his decision by calling the plan a gimmick. He said it "would be a violation of my fiduciary responsibility" to allow the leaders to "adjust the pension fund or its contribution level for the purpose of balancing the budget."
The Comptroller's announcement also raised political questions. Mr. McCall is considered a potential gubernatorial candidate in 1998, in which he could compete against two authors of the pension plan: Mr. Silver in a Democratic primary, and then Mr. Pataki in the general election.
"I'm worried about Carl," Zenia Mucha, Mr. Pataki's spokeswoman, said. "He's either got a bad case of amnesia or a blind case of political ambition. He probably doesn't know whether to see a doctor or a pollster."
The plan devised by Mr. Pataki and the legislative leaders would have produced savings for the state and for local governments, by stretching out repayments to the pension plan that were ordered by the State Court of Appeals in 1993.
Ruling in a lawsuit filed by unions of state workers, the court found that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Legislature had acted illegally in 1990 when they changed pension actuarial methods. The change allowed the state and local governments to make huge reductions in their annual contributions to the pension system and helped the state fill a large budget gap.
In response to the court decision, Mr. McCall devised a schedule for state and local governments to repay the more than $4 billion lost to the pension system, with interest. The Comptroller estimated that it would take at least 12 years to make the system whole.
Republicans criticized him at the time for allowing a very small repayment in 1994, an election year in which his Democratic ticket mate, Mr. Cuomo, would be running for re-election.
The repayment schedule for this year requires the state to pay $110 million, and for local governments that use the state retirement system to pay a total of $120 million. Mr. Pataki proposed in his original budget this year to make those payments by using money that had accumulated in a $360 million fund intended to make supplemental pension payments to retirees.
But on Wednesday, Mr. Pataki and the legislative leaders announced that they would not disturb the supplemental fund and would try to use that money to increase pensions for retirees, as originally intended. Instead, they asked Mr. McCall to stretch out his previous repayment schedule to save money for the state and local governments. The proposal was to eliminate the payments by the state and by local governments in this fiscal year, and would have greatly reduced them in the subsequent five years.
Mr. Pataki argued today that Mr. McCall's original repayment schedule had been arbitrary and that nothing prevented him from changing it.
The Governor also said that at Mr. Silver's behest, he had dropped his proposal to eliminate the State Division of Cemeteries.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Rally Is Cut Short by Profit Taking

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
What appeared to be the making of another strong bond rally was cut short yesterday by a sharp decline in the dollar and profit taking.
Prices surged in morning trading after new economic reports on housing and the job market indicated that economic growth would be weaker than expected in the second quarter. The data raised expectations that the Federal Reserve might reduce interest rates later this year. 
 Carroll J. Delaney, managing director of Stires, O'Donnell & Company, a New York securities firm, said yesterday that while the data were of the "minor variety," the fact that the market was at such lofty levels meant "almost any nuance could initiate a profit-taking spree."
Still, bond prices ended higher, but off the highs of the day. The price of the 30-year bond rose 10/32 , to 11119/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.72 percent, from 6.74 percent on Wednesday.
Also yesterday, the Treasury sold $18.25 billion of one-year bills at an average yield of 5.88 percent, down slightly from 5.90 percent last month and the lowest since Sept. 15, 1994, when it was 5.38 percent. Traders said the sale of the one-year bills went as well as could be expected. The high and low bids were further apart than usually seen at the auction, suggesting that investors were hesitant to buy.
The market first gained after the Labor Department reported initial jobless claims for the week that ended May 20 were at 380,000, higher than forecasts for a drop to 362,000. The week before the figure was 364,000.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, yesterday put the four-week moving average of unemployment claims above an important level of 370,000, to 371,000 -- the first time the level has been briefly breached since the first two weeks of February 1994.
A second report yesterday, on sales of existing homes, was also weaker than economists' forecasts. The National Association of Realtors, a trade group, said that sales of previously owned single-family homes fell 6.4 percent in April to a seasonally adjusted 3.39 million annual rate, the lowest rate since 3.36 million in June 1992. Housing data, Mr. Chan said, continue to defy expectations despite a decline in mortgage rates. Althouth there are signs that housing will bounce back -- as seen, for example, in the home buyers index rleased by the National Association of Home Builders -- "bond traders are trading positions based on today's data, which does not really see a bounce-back," he said.
The advance in bonds, however, quickly gave way to profit taking. Also weighing on the market yesterday was a sharp decline in the dollar. The prospect of the Fed's cutting short-term interest rates to prevent a slowdown from becoming a recession caused alarm on foreign-exchange markets.
The message to the Fed on cutting rates, Mr. Chan of Banc One said, is "clearly don't do it, because if you do, no amount of government intervention is going to prevent the market from heading lower, which will only fuel the flames of inflationary pressures."
Lower interest rates would hurt the dollar by making deposits denominated in it less attractive. And a prolonged slide in the dollar would hurt bonds by diminishing their appeal to foreign investors.
"In short, the decline of the dollar was an early warning signal to the Fed, and provide an easy excuse for many credit market players to take profits," he said.
The market will have an abbreviated session today going into the Memorial Day weekened. The futures market will close at 1 P.M., and the Public Securities Association, a trade group, has recommended that the cash market close at 2 P.M. today.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new one-year bills:

HEADLINE: Powell on Politics: Still Cagily Noncommittal

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
From the viewpoint of some who want to make him President, Colin L. Powell is playing his cards too close to his vest. Either he gives a hint of interest soon, one of his main backers said last week, or people at the grass roots will dismiss him as "too coy."
From his own perspective, his friends say, General Powell has no option except to allow the political drama to unfold. One of them put it this way: "Suppose, just suppose, he wants the job. He has nothing to gain by running after it months ahead of time. That makes him look like everyone else." 
 "I want to keep my options open," the general himself said cagily. "I'm going to do something to try to help make this an even greater country than it is now. Just keep watching. I'll be out there somewhere."
He has certainly done nothing to chide those who have spoken favorably of his potential as a candidate, such as Ken Duberstein, a former White House chief of staff under Ronald Reagan, or former Senators Paul E. Tsongas, a Massachusetts Democrat, and John C. Danforth, a Missouri Republican. Nor has the general tried to head off a Citizens for Powell movement in New Hampshire or a small but persistent national draft-Powell effort. To all who ask, he replies with a smile, "I'm flattered."
As in the Persian Gulf war, he is cautious in assessing potential adversaries and determined, friends say, to follow a strategy that has "the highest potential for success and entails the least possible risk." He still refuses to say whether he is a Republican, a Democrat or neither.
Col. William Smullen, General Powell's spokesman, spends his days knocking down rumors that never stop coming, like a cook swatting flies in midsummer. No, the general has not decided against running. No, he has not signed on to advise Senator Bob Dole's campaign; the two just had a friendly talk. No, he has not been offered the Vice-Presidential nomination by anyone.
It is a high-stakes game. The odds are that it will come to nothing, and it would be easy to dismiss the whole thing. But many professionals do not, because neither President Clinton nor any of the Republican candidates seems to have captured the public imagination yet.
Also, in a time of public disgust with politics and politicians, General Powell, for all his years in Washington, has a reputation for probity, patriotism and independence. He is seen by many as the very archetype of the leader.
Haley Barbour, the Republican national chairman, acknowledged as much this week, telling a group of Washington reporters, "If he were to decide to run, he starts off with a well-deserved reputation and huge stature in this country."
 
Transition Made By Other Generals
General Powell is, of course, untested in the political arena. That could work against him if he proved unable to withstand media scrutiny or to articulate detailed policies. But it could also work for him if he were able to rise above the clamor of the campaign, like some Jimmy Stewart character -- or like Dwight D. Eisenhower.
It is said that if General Powell were obliged to take positions on such divisive issues as abortion or the capital gains tax, his appeal would vanish. The most popular sketch in this year's Gridiron show, staged by Washington journalists, showed him losing his halo every time he removed his officer's cap.
But other war heroes, from George Washington to Andrew Jackson, from U. S. Grant to Eisenhower, have successfully made the transition to Presidential candidacy.
Still doggedly Delphic, General Powell has begun to drop a few hints about his political ideas. A week ago, in a speech to mutual funds executives, he even allowed himself to say a bit about partisanship: "I don't find yet that I fit neatly into either party. I have very strong Republican leanings on economic matters and international affairs matters, but I'm still a New Deal kid from Harlem and the South Bronx. Franklin Roosevelt's picture was in my home."
What about Newt Gingrich's Contract With America? someone asked. The general answered: "Some parts I find a little too hard, a little too harsh, a little too unkind. We do not yet have a level playing field in our society."
They could have been the answers of a moderate Republican, a conservative Democrat or an independent, which is probably precisely the kind of ambiguity that General Powell wanted to convey, and which drives his backers nuts.
 
Three Have Links To Eisenhower
Not coincidentally, the three leaders of the draft-Powell movement, who see him as the perfect Republican nominee for next year, all have links of some kind to General Eisenhower. Two helped to put together the draft-Ike movement in 1952, which sent the World War II hero to the White House for two terms; the third wrote acclaimed biographies of Eisenhower and his Vice President, Richard M. Nixon.
Their goal is to convince General Powell that he would far better serve himself and his country by emulating General Eisenhower rather than George C. Marshall, whom he has long considered his hero, and running for elective office rather than settling for a high appointive position as General Marshall did.
Tex McCrary, the New York publicist, raconteur, wartime bomber pilot and onetime talk-show host, is one of the three draft-Powell leaders. Now 84 years old and ailing, Mr. McCrary remains a formidable advocate. He has thrown himself into this campaign-without-a-candidate with enviable zest; every week he writes to the general, often enclosing what he calls "an attention-grabber," such as a bayonet that former President Francois Mitterrand of France gave him.
The general replies politely, often charmingly, always noncommittally. Recently he wrote, "Tex, you are a piece of work." Not much to go on, but Mr. McCrary keeps at it.
Stephen E. Ambrose, the historian and biographer, has just retired as director of the Eisenhower Center at the University of New Orleans. He scarcely knows General Powell, but the Powell bug has bit him, too. Like Eisenhower and unlike contemporary politicians, the usually low-key Mr. Ambrose said: "General Powell is defined by the word 'trust.' He proves by his life that the American dream is still alive. Ike had that quality, too."
Mr. Ambrose plans to spend full time in the coming months as a volunteer in a political army that does not yet exist, working faxes and phones from his ranch in Montana. He described himself recently as "head over heels on this, determined to do nothing else unless he makes a Sherman-like statement."
Less well known is the third man, Charles J. Kelly Jr., but he was the one who got the whole thing started. Mr. Kelly concedes that General Powell has given him no encouragement, but he says the general "has done nothing to discourage me, which is enough."
 
Can a Centrist Shift the G.O.P.?
Mr. Kelly is not without connections. A retired Wall Street investment banker who was something of a protege of the late Clifford Roberts, one of General Eisenhower's original promoters and best friends, he worked in the Eisenhower White House. He rents the smaller house on the Georgetown property of Ben Bradlee, the former editor of The Washington Post.
Mr. Kelly, too, is busy seeking commitments, building networks, writing letters and taking reporters to lunch at the Metropolitan Club, one of the temples of the Washington establishment.
The three dismiss the idea of an independent candidacy, arguing, among other things, that General Powell is too much of a traditionalist to relish a third-party bid. But they have no ready answer to an obvious question: In an era when conservatives in the mold of Speaker Gingrich dominate the Republican Party, how does a dedicated centrist like the general win the nomination?
When Myrlie Evers-Williams was sworn in this month to head the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, for example, General Powell was there to help celebrate the occasion. News photographs showed him in the company of Jesse Jackson and Betty Shabazz, the widow of Malcolm X -- people who are considered well beyond the pale by Republican right-wingers.
Mr. Kelly, for one, thinks General Powell has the capacity to "realign the Republican Party to the center," but not many political experts agree with him.
By the time of the New Hampshire primary in 1952, Mr. McCrary recalls, General Eisenhower was nowhere in the polls. He still won the nomination. But in 1952, with television in its infancy, campaigns were less expensive and money was easier to raise in the absence of stringent Federal regulations.
A poll taken in March for Time magazine and CNN showed that General Powell is potentially the second most popular Republican candidate without having lifted a finger; Senator Dole ranked first, with 37 percent, in a hypothetical race and General Powell next, with 27 percent. No one else pulled more than 7 percent.
 
Powell Springboard In New Hampshire
Other polls are equally enticing for Powell-boosters. A New York Times/CBS News Poll produced stunning favorability ratings for the general, whose Gulf war achievements have evidently not faded from the public mind. He scored 67 percent among Republicans, 61 percent among Democrats and 52 percent among independents. Other national and state polls have shown that, as a third-party nominee in the 1996 general election, he would pull about a quarter of the vote against Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole.
In a memorandum two weeks ago, Mr. Kelly argued that "New Hampshire is almost ideally positioned to initiate a Powell primary campaign" because "its voters are famously independent-minded and sensitive to candidates' personal character and principles." Registered independents, who make up 31 percent of the state's electorate, are eligible to vote in the Republican primary.
General Powell, who is 58, has almost finished his memoir, which is to be published this fall. It has been bought by Time magazine, which plans to run excerpts and perhaps to put his picture on the cover. The general is committed to a five-week international book tour covering 22 cities and starting in mid-September, which should keep him in the limelight all fall.
To qualify for the New Hampshire ballot, he would not have to make a public declaration until Dec. 22, the filing deadline. That would give him time to finish his tour, take political soundings, authorize trial balloons, start a publicity buildup and then make his announcement.
But Senator Dole might have things clinched by then.
The troika wants the reluctant dragon to say something publicly -- not to declare his candidacy, but to say something at least nominally political, something that they can use to keep the pot boiling -- no later than the 51st anniversary of D-Day, June 6. That would underline the Eisenhower connection, but Colonel Smullen says nothing will be forthcoming until the tour has ended.

HEADLINE: SENATE APPROVES PROPOSAL TO BALANCE BUDGET BY 2002; TALKS WITH HOUSE ARE NEXT

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
In what could be a first step toward a revolutionary change in Government economic policy, the Senate today approved a Republican road map that is supposed to put the Government on the course to a balanced Federal budget in seven years.
After a week of highly partisan debate and votes on more than 50 amendments, most of them generally along party lines, the proposed budget calling for nearly $1 trillion in savings by 2002 was approved 57 to 42. The House endorsed a similar blueprint last week. All Republicans and three Democrats -- Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Sam Nunn of Georgia and Charles S. Robb of Virginia -- voted for the measure today. The remaining Democrats voted "no." 
 In the closing debate, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, said the vote would "make history."
In one respect, the vote is a milestone. It marks what seems to be the serious intention of a majority of the Senate to control spending on popular Government programs, saving enough money to balance the budget.
But in other respects, this is no more than the beginning of an arduous journey with land mines all along the way. Over the next few months, lawmakers will feel the heat as they go beyond the principle of saving money and decide exactly who will pay the price and how much they will pay.
The next step is for a conference committee to work out the differences between the Senate budget resolution and the one passed by the House.
Final remarks in today's debate offered a preview of arguments to come as Democrats contended that Republicans would protect the privileged at the expense of the needy and Mr. Dole countered that their complaints amounted to "the same old liberal rhetoric."
Senator Jim Exon of Nebraska, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee, declared, "It's a budget that takes away unfairly from our seniors, children and least fortunate, but disproportionately and unfairly lines the pockets of the wealthiest among us."
But Mr. Dole asserted that Democrats in control of Congress for a generation had piled up the nation's debt.
"In 1994," he said, "we had a political revolution, an earthquake."
And Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee who has devoted his career to the sometimes quixotic goal of cutting the deficit, said that from now on, "we're going to pay our own bills."
Settling the differences between the two versions of the proposed budget will not be easy because the House made a $350 billion tax cut the centerpiece of its plan, and the Senate on Tuesday rejected such a tax reduction by a margin of more than 2 to 1.
The really heavy political lifting will come after a single budget resolution is approved. Such a resolution only sets spending limits for broad areas of Government programs like the military, transportation and education. To actually balance the budget, Congress must decide on the policy changes that will allow it to wring the billions in savings it has specified out of hundreds of Government programs.
It is one thing to say, as the Senate measure does, that a quarter of a trillion dollars will be saved in Medicare over the next seven years. It is another matter to show exactly how these savings will be accomplished and to explain to retirees how their medical benefits would be reduced.
In addition, before the year is out, Republicans must compromise with President Clinton, who vigorously contests the way the Senate and House found most of their savings in the Government's domestic policy activities.
The budget resolution is not subject to a Presidential veto. But the measures to implement it are subject to veto. The Republican majorities in the Senate and House are probably not sufficient to override vetoes on such important matters.
Furthermore, while the Republican Congress seems to be showing more resolve this year about balancing the budget than Congress ever did when it was in Democratic hands, the laws that were passed this year can always be changed in the future.
Congress has promised tough measures to balance the budget many times before, the most prominent being the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings laws of the mid-1980's. But each time these laws started to pinch, they were relaxed.
Still, the importance of today's vote should not be underestimated. Congress is now on record with promises to take deep bites out of popular Government programs like Medicare and education and to force the states to bear a larger burden of programs for the poor like Medicaid and public assistance or trim the benefits.
While most of the week was spent in partisan warfare, Republican Presidential politics provided a sideshow. Mr. Dole found himself struggling to meet conservative markers laid down by a rival for the Republican nomination, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas.
Today, to prove his conservative bona fides, Mr. Dole engineered an amendment that committed the Senate to using for tax reductions any new money that the Congressional Budget Office finds is the result of an improved economy growing out of a balanced budget.
"Make no mistake about it," Mr. Dole said. "In the final analysis, we intend to provide tax relief."
The budget office has estimated that if a balanced budget is adhered to for seven years, the savings in lower interest rates on Government bonds would amount to $170 billion.
But there is less to this than meets the eye. Only $3 billion would be available next year, the budget office found, and $123 billion of the benefits would not accrue until after the turn of the century.
Republican senators say that their budget does not really lower Government spending but merely reduces the rate of growth of spending. That is literally true. But in many areas, reducing the rate at which spending grows would have the effect of cutting back Government services, especially in health care.
Without a change in the law, spending for Medicare, the Government health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, is expected to grow by about 10 percent a year. This is not because the program is being expanded but because inflation in overall medical costs and an increase in the number of beneficiaries each year requires additional spending just to maintain the current level of services.
Over the next seven years, compared with what the budget office believes would be the Government's expenditures without changes in the law, the Senate measure would reduce spending for Medicare by $256 billion and spending for Medicaid, which provides coverage for the poor, by $175 billion.
Republicans say that the trust fund that pays part of Medicare costs will run out of money by 2002 without changes. Still, the cuts anticipated by the Senate resolution are far greater than what would be needed to make the program solvent.
The Senate resolution would cut other Government benefits, including welfare, food stamps and Government pensions, by $209 billion, but Social Security benefits would basically be untouched.
The resolution would allow military spending to rise by about $25 billion over a seven-year period, the same amount favored by the Clinton Administration. But other domestic discretionary spending -- ranging as widely as education and transportation, paper clips and space shuttles -- would be reduced by $390 billion below what would otherwise be spent if the programs rose at the rate of inflation.
The Senate budget resolution proposes but does not require that these levels be met through steps like these: shutting down the Commerce Department; paring the operating budgets of the National Park Service, the Forest Service and the Wildlife Service; abolishing subsidies for Amtrak and municipal mass transit systems, and lowering allotments for scientific research.
One of the most controversial proposals in the Senate resolution is to reduce outlays for the earned-income tax credit, a program that gives tax breaks and, in some instances, direct payments to low-income working families.
One threatened cut was restored today. The Senate voted to rearrange allotments so that the Government's interest subsidy on student loans would not have to be cut.

Chart: "Compare and Contrast: Budget Proposals - The House and Senate Versions"
 Following are areas of significant difference between the House and Senate budget proposals: Yesterday the Senate passed its budget resolution, a broad outline in fiscal 1996. The House passed its version last week.
 
Total Deficit Reduction
 House: $1.04 trillion over seven years, when measured against the same "baseline," or starting point, used by the Senate.
 Senate: $961 billion over seven years.
 
Tax Cuts
 House: $353 billion over seven years.
 Senate: $170 billion over seven years, if the Congressional Budget Office certifies that this much money can be saved in lower interest payments on Government bonds.
 
Medicare
 House: $288 billion in savings over seven years, achieved by reducing the growth rate of the program to 5.4 percent a year from 10 percent.
 Senate: $256 billion in savings over seven years, achieved by reducing the growth rate to 7.1 percent a year from 10 percent.
 
Medicaid
 House: $187 billion in suggested savings over seven years, achieved by converting the federal share of the program to a block grant and transferring it to the states and by gradually reducing growth to 4 percent a year from nearly 10 percent.
 Senate: $175 billion in suggested savings over seven years, achieved by means similar to those in the House budget.
 
Welfare
 House: $101 billion in savings over seven years by converting major welfare programs into block grants to the states.
 Senate: $80 billion in savings over seven years, block grants.
 
Military Spending
 House: $67.9 billion increase in spending over seven years above the Senate budget and the Clinton administration's proposal, which called for increasing spending by $25 billion over seven years.
 Senate: $25 billion increase, like the Clinton proposal, which would keep defense spending at or below a "hard" freeze - unadjusted for inflation.
 
Non-Military Discretionary Spending
 House: $192 billion in savings over seven years, measured against a freeze at the 1995 enacted level.
 Senate: $190 billion in savings over seven years, measured against a freeze at the 1995 enacted level.
 
Agriculture
 House: $17 billion in savings over seven years in agricultural production programs.
 Senate: $12 billion over seven years.
 
Departments Abolished
 House: Departments of Commerce, Education and Energy.
 Senate: Department of Commerce

HEADLINE: In New Sign of Slow Economy, Home Resales Plunge by 6.4%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
More signs emerged today that the economy was heading toward a sharp slowdown. Sales of existing homes fell 6.4 percent in April to the lowest level in almost three years, despite declining mortgage rates.
The decline in home resales last month, to 3.39 million at an annual rate, was the third decrease in four months, the National Association of Realtors said. In March, sales rose at an unrevised rate of 5.8 percent. 
 "Housing sales are a leading indicator of the economy," said Peter Kretzmer, an economist at Nationsbank in New York. "The overall decline in the economy may be sharper than most people perceive."
A separate report from the Labor Department underscored that point. First-time jobless claims rose 13,000 last week to 380,000, putting them at the highest level since last July, the agency reported. Additionally, the less volatile four-week average for claims rose to a two-and-a-half-year high.
The new evidence of weakness follows Wednesday's report that orders for durable goods fell a steep 4 percent in April and reports earlier this month showing declines in retail sales and industrial production.
The slowdown stems from the Federal Reserve's moves to increase short-term interest rates seven times from February 1994 to February 1995 to cool a rapidly growing economy and keep inflationary pressure in check.
The level of home resales was the lowest since June 1992, when it was also 3.39 million, said Trisha Morris, a spokeswoman for the realtors association. Before that, the low was 3.27 million in January 1992, she said. Before today's housing report, analysts expected a decline of three-tenths of a percent in home resales during April.
For all of 1995, the realty group is projecting that existing-home sales will fall 7 percent from last year's 3.728 million rate, which the group said was the second-best annual showing on record.
By region, April home resales fell 8.1 percent in the South to an annual rate of 1.240 million, declined 6.6 percent, to 710,000, in the West and fell 6.3 percent in the Midwest to 900,000. Sales were unchanged in the Northeast at 550,000.
The realty group said the average price for a home rose five-tenths of a percent, to $108,400 in April from $107,900 in March.
The report showed that even though 30-year mortgage rates have been heading down, many consumers were still leery about committing to home purchases. Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.85 percent this week, up a bit from 7.83 percent last week, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said today.
In April, the rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage averaged 8.32 percent, down from 8.46 percent in March and 8.77 percent in February. That put the average monthly payment on a $100,000 loan at $756.19 in April. When rates were 6.74 percent in mid-October 1993, the monthly payment stood at $647.93.

The Quebec Nordiques surrendered to the economics of playing in a small market yesterday and were acquired for $75 million by the same entertainment company that purchased the Denver Nuggets in 1989.
COMSAT Entertainment Group follows the sports-as-entertainment lead of the Walt Disney Co., which owns the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, and Wayne Huizenga, the former chairman of Blockbuster Entertainment, who owns the Florida Panthers. 
 The sale price exceeds the $50 million expansion fees paid by the Anaheim, Miami, San Jose, Tampa Bay and Ottawa teams. In 1984, the Hartford Whalers sold for $47.5 million. Of the $1 billion paid for Madison Square Garden by ITT and Cablevision this year, the Rangers probably accounted for about $100 million.
The Nordiques were valued at $49 million by Financial World, but their value was hampered by playing in the small-market Quebec and in an inadequate arena, le Colisee, which holds 15,399.
The team will be worth much more in a larger market, where a new arena, the Pepsi Center, is scheduled to open for the 1997-98 season. The team will share McNichols Arena with the Nuggets for two seasons.
"The N.H.L. is very clear about not seeing this team play in McNichols beyond two years," said Charlie Lyons, the president of COMSAT Entertainment."
In moving, the team transfers from a market with 396,000 TV households to one with 1.1 million.
COMSAT's entertainment interests include film and TV production, hotel TV programming and communications systems.
Lyons met Marcel Aubut, the head of the Nordiques' ownership group, in December. Aubut has been working with the provincial government on financing to keep the Nordiques from moving and to build a modern arena. COMSAT's talks to buy the team got serious in the past week.
COMSAT will retain the services of Marc Crawford, the Nordiques coach, and Pierre Lacroix, the general manager.
The Nordiques' shift to Denver means the return of the National Hockey League to a market that lost its team, the Colorado Rockies, when John McMullen acquired them in 1982 and turned them into the New Jersey Devils.
Lyons said the Rockies "had a marketing problem, not a market problem then." He said there were some doubts, since erased, that major league baseball and pro basketball would work in Denver.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Lumber Prices Lower on Report Showing Weakness in Housing

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Lumber prices fell the daily limit yesterday after a disappointing housing report reinforced fears of a glut in lumber caused by a weak housing market.
On other commodity markets, cotton prices surged. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities fell 0.95 point, to 235.30. 
 Lumber prices fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned single-family homes fell 6.4 percent in April to the lowest level in nearly three years.
"Those numbers were just miserable -- there's no other word for it," said Michael Young, an analyst with the Pacific Futures Trading Company. "It's continued evidence of sluggishness in the new-home market as well."
Lumber for July delivery fell $10, to $251.10 for 1,000 board feet, and November lumber fell to a three-week low of $267.20 for 1,000 board feet.
Cash lumber prices have been at their lowest levels in years amid a glut of cut wood and dampened enthusiasm about the economy. Futures prices are beginning to fall in accord, analysts said.
Lumber prices have fallen for months as housing starts have fallen to new lows and inventory has backed up.
Some traders attributed the stockpile in inventory to the continued cutting in Canada, where prices of wood byproducts like newspaper pulp are soaring to all-time highs. That has encouraged more lumber companies to cut trees for pulping, depressing the price of wood.
"It's gone from bad to worse lately," said Neil Schmaedick, an analyst with Smith Barney Inc. in Eugene, Ore. "Until we see a break in paper and pulp prices, we're not going to see a rally."
The July cotton contract neared a return to Civil War highs on the New York Cotton Exchange yesterday, as buying was tied to fears of a shortage before the new crop becomes available.
July cotton rose the limit, 2 cents, to $1.12 a pound, while new-crop contracts fell amid improved weather conditions in some growing areas and lower mill consumption figures.
The Census Bureau said seasonally adjusted daily average cotton consumption fell to 41,686 bales in April from 43,007 in March. The National Cotton Council reported that textile mills consumed less cotton because of high prices.
Cotton prices reached $1.172 a pound on April 24, the highest since the Civil War, on strong worldwide demand for the American crop and fears that the supplies would run out before August, when the new crop is to be harvested.

HEADLINE: House Foes Talking on Foreign Aid Bill

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
With the vote on the delicate foreign aid bill postponed until June, House Republicans are negotiating with Democrats in hopes of making the bill more palatable to Democrats, according to some of those involved.
But the negotiations are tricky because raising the amount of foreign aid, to appeal to Democrats, could cost Republican votes. And the central sticking point is less the money than whether three agencies are retained or melded into the State Department. 
 Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, Republican of New York and chairman of the Rules Committee, said today that the Democrats wanted an extra half-billion dollars restored to the bill, which cuts foreign aid from $17.4 billion in 1995 to $16.5 billion in 1996 and $15.4 billion in 1997.
In addition to the reduction in money, the bill, the first foreign aid package designed by Congressional Republicans since the Truman Administration, would also eliminate three agencies -- the Agency for International Development, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the United States Information Agency -- that Democrats hold dear. It also would attempt to influence American policy toward other countries by restricting ways in which American aid could be spent, which prompted President Clinton to threaten to veto the bill, calling it a "frontal assault" on Presidential authority.
"If this whole bill goes down, there could be further cuts," Mr. Solomon said. "If Democrats aren't going to support it, and we didn't have the votes, then there will be further cuts. It's a fragile ball that's out there."
Republicans yanked the bill off the House floor Wednesday night, with Democrats asserting that the new majority did not have the votes to pass it. Republicans said today that they could have passed the bill without Democrats, but that they were in danger of losing several hard-core conservative Republicans if those members did not have a chance to offer their own amendments.
There were 100 amendments to the bill and the vote in the House was scheduled for today. But by the end of Wednesday, the House had debated only nine of them. House leaders then stopped the debate and postponed the vote to June 7.
Democrats said Republicans came to them on the floor to discuss a compromise, which the Democrats rejected because it still cut the agencies. "We had very strong indications that they didn't have the votes," said one Democratic aide.
Mr. Solomon said that between now and the vote on June 7, the negotiations would continue and he expected heavy lobbying by organizations such as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, to help persuade Democrats, who are the natural allies of foreign aid bills, to come on board. "Aipac is putting pressure on some of those Democrats to vote for it," Mr. Solomon said. "That's what will happen over the next eight days. If they don't vote for it, there's apt to be other trouble down the road" in the form of more drastic cuts.
Still, Mr. Solomon said he was "confident" that his party could gather enough Republicans, "if we had to," to vote for the bill despite their lifelong antipathy toward foreign aid.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said the same thing today. "We have the votes," he told reporters. "I'm not worried about passage." In private meetings with Republicans, he pressed for passage, saying, according to one Republican, that the bill amounts to "the projection of American power and presence around the globe in a nonmilitary way at a cost of one cent on the federal dollar."
Tony Blankley, Mr. Gingrich's spokesman, said of the negotiations with Democrats that the goal was a bipartisan foreign policy. The Republican party, he said, "is reorienting as a majority governing party, and there are old instincts that when you are in the minority, there are certain things you don't vote for." He added: "Those things are reversed in this case for both parties. So we're in that process.
"But on something as unpopular as foreign aid, that we were in single digits on possible no votes was a good sign. And we're not convinced we won't get Democrats. After all, there is Israeli aid, and that's a component in any foreign aid package."
While the Republican bill would slash aid to other regions, including Russia and Africa, it would continue the current $3 billion per year commitment to Israel.
Democratic aides said that the party was unified against the bill and that the party's caucus today revealed that only about four members might vote with the Republicans. But Mr. Solomon said that he believed about a dozen Democrats might defect, but if they did not, the Republicans would fall in line.
"We are cohesive enough, we can provide our own votes, because you've got people like me," Mr. Solomon said. "I've never voted for a foreign aid bill. I'm with the conservative hard core, the people who are not of the internationalist group. But we are going to support it and we'll give them the votes they need. You may have 8 or 10 Republicans who don't want to vote for it, and if we get no Democrats, then we just have to ask our people to vote for it."

HEADLINE: German Accuses Tourist Office of Prejudice

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN, May 25

 BODY:
An official of Germany's Government-financed tourism office in New York City said tonight that he had been dismissed after uncovering a directive from his head office in Frankfurt saying "Jews, blacks, Hispanics and Asiatics" should be discouraged from visiting Germany.
Government officials here sought to distance themselves from the directive as a statement of German policy and said they could not explain how it came to be in the files of the New York City office. 
 The New York German tourism office is already embroiled in several racial and sexual harassment suits and recently dismissed one of its employees who was involved in translating an article that sought to deny the Holocaust.
Fred Gross, the acting head of the New York tourism office, said on German television tonight that he was suing his employers, a Frankfurt-based office supposed to promote tourism in Germany. The office receives around 85 percent of its funds, which total over $30 million a year, from the Government in Bonn.
Mr. Gross said the document had not been formally withdrawn even after he drew the attention of his superiors to it.
German television showed an excerpt from the document referring specifically to "Jews, blacks, Hispanics and Asiatics" as people who should not be enocouraged to visit Germany.
Ulrich Geisendorf, an official of the Economics Ministry, which finances the tourism agency, described the document as "worthless." He said it dated to 1984 and did not reflect the practices of German tourism. It was not known who wrote the document.
In fact, Mr. Geisendorf said, American Jews had been encouraged to visit his country.
The existence of the document, however, is a major embarrassment for the Bonn Government, particularly since the tourism office has acquired a reputation for controversy and impropriety.
This week, the office's assets were attached by a New York State court in connection with a $3.5 million sexual harassment suit brought last year by an employee, Monique Schlein. Another employee, Christa Willibald, has brought a $1 million racial discrimination suit.
This month, Elke Berg, another employee at the office, was dismissed for translating an article by her husband calling the Holocaust an "absurd story."
At that time, Gunter Colonius, the head of the tourism agency in Frankfurt, said the tourism office "tolerates neither anti-Semitic statements nor the dissemination of the Auschwitz lie," a phrase by which Germans refer to attempts to discount the Holocaust.
A former director of the New York office, Henning Schreiber, was recalled to Frankfurt following the complaints of racial and sexual harassment. The monetary lawsuits outstanding against the German office now total some $15 million.

HEADLINE: Clinton Urges Investment In Ulster

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
President Clinton urged American companies today to invest in Northern Ireland, saying jobs created by new factories and businesses there would "lift the despair that breeds violence" and help turn a nine-month-old cease-fire into a permanent peace.
"We must make hope real," Mr. Clinton said, addressing 300 business and political leaders at a conference here on trade and investment in Ireland and Northern Ireland. 
 "I urge American businesses and all others to consider investing in Northern Ireland and the border counties," the President said, referring to border counties of the Republic of Ireland.
Mr. Clinton also vowed to battle for more American aid for Ireland despite the Republican onslaught on his budget proposals in Congress. He said he would seek a roughly 60 percent increase -- to $60 million over the next two years -- in the American contribution to the International Fund for Ireland. The fund channels some $50 million a year in economic assistance to Ireland from the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
"Some want to cut these programs which support peace," the President said, acknowledging Congressional opposition to the increase. He called such resistance "a grave error."
Saying economic development would also depend on disarmament, he urged the Irish Republican Army and Protestant paramilitary forces in Northern Ireland to start turning in weapons, so both sides could "get rid of the guns and bombs for good."
The call seems to increase the pressure on the I.R.A. at least to make a gesture by surrendering some weapons -- the price Britain is demanding for including the group's political wing, Sinn Fein, in all-party talks on a permanent settlement for the British-ruled province.
The White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said afterward that Mr. Clinton was hoping to visit Ireland and Britain in the late fall or early winter.
In a rare meeting here on Wednesday, Britain's chief official for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, urged Sinn Fein's president, Gerry Adams, to start the process of "decommissioning" the I.R.A.'s weapons, saying that would be the most effective way of giving businesses enough confidence to invest.
The premise of the business conference here and another held in Belfast in December is that much of the sectarian violence in Northern Ireland over the last 25 years reflects frustration and extremism bred by high levels of unemployment on both sides of the border.
That has led the Clinton Administration to develop a strategy that Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown today called "commercial diplomacy," or seeking to strengthen the cease-fire by increasing employment and economic development.
"People have a right to expect that risks for peace will bring opportunities and growth," Mr. Brown said.
The Administration has adopted a similar approach toward Israel's agreement with the P.L.O. on extending Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories. Last fall the United States helped organize a business conference in Morocco on investing in the Middle East.
The most important reason American companies should set up in Northern Ireland and the border countries of the Irish Republic, Mr. Brown said, would be to gain tariff-free access to the 15-nation European Union market.
Investors would also be drawing on a "large pool of educated, motivated and English-speaking workers" earning an average hourly wage that is 36 percent lower than that paid in the United States, he said.
Finally, Mr. Brown said, both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland offer tax and other incentives that have helped American companies investing there earn a healthy 25.8 percent annual return, the highest average in Europe.
Paradoxically, the short-term effect of peace in Northern Ireland will be a dampening of economic activity, as the British Army pulls out and police and other security services are reduced to normal levels.
"There is a down side to peace," Baroness Denton, the under secretary of state for the economy in Northern Ireland, said in an interview, while emphasizing that the British Government would gradually "recycle" the security savings back into the province's economy. By the end of the century, Britain hopes to create 60,000 more jobs in the province, she said.

HEADLINE: Reducing Debt Has a Depressing History

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Forever in Debt?" (Op-Ed, May 21), the British historian Paul Johnson uses at least three misleading or incorrect statements that the best government is one with no outstanding debt: 
 (1) While it is true that the United States national debt was virtually eliminated in 1835 and 1836, it is also true that a serious economic depression began in 1837. Every sustained period of debt reduction in United States history has been immediately followed by a depression. There have been six such periods, preceding the economic collapses of 1819, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1893 and 1929. For whatever reasons, systematic debt reduction has never led to prosperity.
(2) Mr. Johnson's claim that the national debt "was cut by half" between 1946 and 1975 is false. There has been no systematic debt reduction since World War II. Coincidentally or otherwise, there has been no serious depression since then.
(3) There have been no "huge increases" in Federal Government employees since 1975. There were 2.9 million Federal civilian employees in that year, and 3.1 million in 1992.

Newman's May 20 Op-Ed article "What Inner-City Jobs for Welfare Moms?" suggests that the chief job-search obstacle faced by recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children in the ghettos is unique to them. On the contrary, middle-class Americans have periodically faced a lack of local job opportunity and have been required to adjust. 
 Given the staggering unemployment statistics -- 18 percent plus -- in neighborhoods such as central Harlem, it seems an exercise in futility to continue the job search there. The history of immigrant and middle-class families speaks eloquently of the necessity of relocating where work is to be found.
Jobs do not, in a free society, move to meet the job-seekers; it's the other way around.
Even a leaner Federal Government could provide an essential service: a central data base matching job-seeker qualifications with constantly updated work openings in the private sector across the country. Problems in housing and training could be met locally with tax incentives and private philanthropy. Is this not the public-private cooperation our employment figures cry out for?

HEADLINE: In Book, Simpson Friend Takes a Skeptical Tone

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 25

 BODY:
On the day after Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman were killed, O. J. Simpson boasted to friends and to Brian (Kato) Kaelin that Mr. Kaelin could provide him with an alibi, according to a new book based on extensive interviews that Mr. Kaelin gave before taking the stand in March.
But the book, by a freelance writer, Marc Eliot, says Mr. Kaelin knew he could not account for Mr. Simpson's whereabouts throughout the evening of June 12. Indeed, on several occasions, Mr. Eliot writes, Mr. Kaelin told him that he believed that Mr. Simpson was a murderer. 
 The book, "Kato Kaelin: The Whole Truth," built around 16 hours of taped interviews, contains few other revelations or dramatic deviations from Mr. Kaelin's testimony. But in it the aspiring actor, who lived for a time with both Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, appears far less protective and far more skeptical of Mr. Simpson, a man he has vowed to help in any way he can. Prosectors may want to explore Mr. Kaelin's elaborations further under oath.
After the interviews, Mr. Kaelin and Mr. Eliot had a falling-out, and the $545,000 that the publisher, HarperCollins, paid for the book went to Mr. Eliot alone. Mr. Kaelin, who has gone from unemployment and a jalopy to fame and a Mercedes since the killings, is expected to seek part of that advance, though his lawyer, Michael Plotkin of Los Angeles, declined to comment today.
Meantime, prosecutors are weighing whether to recall Mr. Kaelin to the witness stand.
His published recollections include an account of the morning of June 13, when he joined friends and relatives of Mr. Simpson in his home at 360 North Rockingham Avenue. Mr. Simpson, he recalled, sat glued to the television set, watching news reports of the killings. When a reporter stated that Mr. Simpson could not account for his whereabouts at the time of the killings, Mr. Kaelin said Mr. Simpson declared: "That's not true. Kato knows where I was! Kato knows my alibi! Kato went to McDonald's with me. And Kato knows I went back into the house after."
Mr. Eliot said Mr. Kaelin then related: "In my head I went, 'No, I never saw you go in the house after McDonald's.' And I didn't. The last thing I remembered seeing before going into my room was O. J. standing by the driver's side of his Bentley."
Mr. Kaelin also recalled the evening of June 12, just before the killings, when he saw Mr. Simpson several times. But unlike the bland and disjointed version he offered on the witness stand -- which, Mr. Eliot contends, was an act designed to protect Mr. Simpson -- the book version is characterized by a persistent sense of disquiet.
After hearing Mr. Simpson describe both the dance recital he attended with his family early that evening and after accompanying Mr. Simpson to McDonald's, Mr. Kaelin said he felt something was amiss. "I don't know why, but the entire night, I kept having the feeling that something was not right," he said.
He felt the same way around 11 P.M., he said, when he spotted a duffle bag -- still unaccounted for -- on the driveway of Mr. Simpson's house, while the rest of the luggage that Mr. Simpson was taking to Chicago sat yards away by the limousine that took him to the airport.
"I didn't remember seeing it before, and couldn't understand why it was there since O. J.'s luggage usually is where the golf clubs had been," he said. "This made no sense, I told myself."
The Mr. Simpson he saw the day after the killings was strangely, disconcertingly detached, Mr. Kaelin says in the book, and the tearful Mr. Simpson he saw at Mrs. Simpson's wake was just as odd. "I thought it was possible he was crying just crocodile tears," Mr. Kaelin said. "The impact of sadness on his part just wasn't there."
Under oath last March, Mr. Kaelin testified that the Simpsons had a good relationship the entire time he knew them. But in the book, he said that Mrs. Simpson told him that she suspected Mr. Simpson both videotaped her in bed with other men and was tapping her phone. She told Mr. Kaelin, as she had others, that Mr. Simpson's jealousy would lead him to kill her but that he would go unpunished because of his celebrity.
Mr. Eliot, whose other books include biographies of Bruce Springsteen and Walt Disney, described his former collaborator as a "master opportunist." He said that his resolve to go forward with the project grew as he watched Mr. Kaelin "fandango his way through six days of testimony."
Like various other Simpson case authors, Mr. Eliot has pledged to donate a portion of the book's proceeds to the Simpsons' two young children, Justin and Sydney. Like his fellow writers, he has not specified the amount.

HEADLINE: Senate Welfare Plan Cuts $41 Billion Over 7 Years

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office said today that welfare legislation proposed by leading Senate Republicans would cut projected spending by more than $41 billion over the next seven years, a saving of at least 10 percent.
But the budget office said the proposal's work requirements were so stringent that most states could not meet them. And if states did comply, it suggested, they would have to spend most of their Federal welfare money on job training, child care and related services, rather than on direct assistance to poor people. 
 The bill, scheduled to be considered Friday by the Senate Finance Committee, was drafted by the chairman of the panel, Bob Packwood of Oregon, working closely with Bob Dole, the Republican leader.
Like a bill approved by the House in March, the Senate plan would eliminate the Federal guarantee of cash assistance for millions of poor families that meet eligibility criteria set by Federal and state law. Instead, each state would receive a lump sum, or block grant, equal to the amount of Federal welfare spending in the state in 1994.
Under Mr. Packwood's bill, the block grants would total $16.8 billion a year from 1996 to 2000, without any adjustment for inflation or population growth. The grants would not necessarily increase if hard times led more people to seek aid.
Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, has criticized many features of the Senate bill. But at a meeting with Administration officials on Wednesday, Democratic members of the Finance Committee chided the Administration for what they said was President Clinton's failure to lead an aggressive attack on Mr. Packwood's bill.
People who were at the meeting said Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, Democrat of Illinois, held up a copy of a report by the Department of Health and Human Services estimating that four million children would lose Federal welfare benefits because the bill would set a five-year limit on payments to any family.
White House officials responded then that the Senate bill was less harsh than the House bill. Several Senate Democrats said they left the meeting with a clear impression that President Clinton would not veto Mr. Packwood's bill, and some Administration officials said they had reached the same conclusion.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who has studied welfare policy for several decades, said he was disappointed that the Administration was not fighting to preserve welfare as an entitlement, available to all who meet the eligibility criteria.
Administration officials have said that Mr. Clinton will veto any bill replacing food stamps with block grants. But they have not made such threats about the main cash welfare program for poor children.
Mr. Packwood's bill would continue a work program established under the last major welfare law, the Family Support Act of 1988, but the requirements would be more stringent. Half of all the adults on welfare in each state would have to be enrolled in work or training programs by 2001. States failing to meet these requirements could lose 5 percent of their Federal welfare money grants.
The Department of Health and Human Services said that to comply with these requirements, states would have to spend $12.7 billion a year, or three-fourths of the block grant money, on jobs, training, education and child care. That would leave only one-fourth of the money for actual welfare benefits. The department, like the Congressional Budget Office, concluded that many states would simply pay the financial penalties rather than comply.
Republicans say that states can cope with the block grant restrictions because they can run welfare programs more efficiently than the Federal Government and will move many people from welfare to work.

HEADLINE: Long Beach Journal;
From Cambodia to Doughnut Shops

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: LONG BEACH, Calif., May 21

 BODY:
The first English words that Ly Yiv learned 15 years ago after fleeing the slaughter in Cambodia were the names of doughnuts: twist, glazed and jelly, chocolate, buttermilk and old-fashioned.
His first impressions of the United States remain crystal clear. "I came here to California at 2 o'clock in the afternoon," said Mr. Yiv, now 45, "and at midnight I went to learn how to bake doughnuts with my friend. I had coffee and ate hot dogs -- a lot of hot dogs -- and I stayed all night." 
 Ever since, he has been earning his living making doughnuts.
Cambodian refugees and doughnuts, which got their distinctive shape in 19th-century America, may seem an odd match, but the oddest thing is that Mr. Yiv's story is typical. Over the past decade and a half, Cambodian refugees have, with little fanfare, virtually taken over the doughnut business in California, making it their primary route into the local economy.
Building on the inspiration of a refugee named Ted Ngoy, and by extending credit to one another, Cambodian immigrants have opened one small shop after another, cutting deeply into the business of large chains like Winchell's Donut Houses, which once dominated the California market. Today, industry analysts say Cambodians own about 80 percent of the doughnut shops in the state.
These refugees, survivors of the Khmer Rouge government that caused the deaths of a million people in the late 1970's, brought with them memories of one of the century's great horrors. About 200,000 Cambodians reached the United States, with close to half settling in Southern California, particularly in the Little Phnom Penh section of Long Beach, where they began their doughnut boom in the 1980's.
Mr. Ngoy, who trained at Winchell's in the late 1970's, became rich by opening small doughnut shops and selling them to newer arrivals. He has since returned to a less chaotic Cambodia to enter politics, leaving behind a refugee community forever altered by doughnuts.
"In my computer, I have 2,400 Cambodian doughnut shops in California," said Ning Yen, 39, who started with a small shop and now owns an $8 million business distributing doughnut-making equipment.
"I think it's already too many now," said Mr. Yen, a disciple of Mr. Ngoy, "and people are fighting each other for business. They just kept opening doughnut shops, and there is not enough demand for them all."
Nancy Parker, president of Winchell's, said her company was now down to 120 outlets in California. Before the Cambodian influx, Winchell's had more than 1,000 outlets in the western United States, mostly in California.
"Where we had one Winchell's shop, they now have three or four Cambodian shops," Ms. Parker said. "They were very happy with a much lesser volume."
Defying California's health-food trend, she said, the number of doughnut shops in the state grew by 55 percent from 1985 to 1993, even as consumption fell by nearly 10 percent. In Los Angeles, for example, there is 1 doughnut shop for every 7,500 people, compared with 1 per 30,000 more common elsewhere in the country.
Scott Thov, an associate of Mr. Ngoy, said it takes about $80,000 to open a small shop, adding that a family of three to five people can manage a business alone, pulling themselves up from the poverty that still affects many of the refugees.
At Good Time Donuts in Diamond Bar, near here, Mr. Yiv, who was a landowner in Cambodia, said that while doughnuts were little known there, the business here had been a haven for refugees in an alien culture.
"Some people can't write and can't tell the name," he said, "but they can smell the flour and they can make the doughnut. This is a good business for people who don't speak too much English. They can say, 'Good morning' and 'How are you?' and count the money."
Mr. Yiv said Cambodians preferred doughnut shops to liquor stores or gas stations because they were not as susceptible to robbery, but Mr. Thov said many doughnut shops had been cutting back nighttime hours because of a rising fear of crime.
Sun's Donuts in Westminster remains open around the clock, with family members working in shifts. When one of the family's three children, Naun Sinn, was married last year, the family enlisted a friend to keep the shop open during the wedding.
Now Mr. Sinn, 26, whose father was a teacher before the Khmer Rouge takeover, starts in the afternoon and works until 10 P.M. and studies management at California State University at Fullerton. His wife, Sophan Chea, 23, who is studying to become a teacher, does her homework at a table in the back of the shop.
With the California market saturated, but with the refugees' entrepreneurial appetite far from sated, Mr. Yen said, some shop owners are looking to expand beyond California.
Perhaps back in Cambodia, an untapped market? "Too small," Mr. Yen said. "Only six million people -- less than Los Angeles.
"We are looking to go to China."

HEADLINE: SENATE APPROVES PROPOSAL TO BALANCE BUDGET BY 2002; TALKS WITH HOUSE ARE NEXT;
Fight Now Turns Intraparty, And Battleground Is Taxes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
Republicans in Congress have been fighting Democrats for five months over how to balance the Federal budget. Now they start fighting each other.
With broad-brush proposals to reach fiscal balance now approved by both the House and the Senate, the Republican majorities in the two chambers will begin haggling on Friday to reach a compromise plan that both ends of the Capitol can support. And they immediately confront a yawning split over the most divisive issue of the entire budget process: tax relief. 
 "It's the crux of the issue," Richard May, the staff director of the House Budget Committee, said today. "Everything else revolves around tax cuts. The longer this thing hangs out there, the bigger problem it becomes."
Already it is immense enough. The budget plan that the Senate approved today omits any guarantee of a tax cut, in large part because Republican moderates refused to go along with one until the deficit is on a proven path toward zero. The plan does reserve up to $170 billion for tax relief later, but only if lower deficits strengthen the economy and create a Government windfall from lower interest rates and greater tax revenue.
By contrast, the House would slash taxes by $350 billion over seven years, half of that for $500-a-child credits to taxpaying families earning $200,000 a year or less. Most of the rest would go toward tax breaks for capital gains, estates, small businesses, well-off Social Security recipients and married couples.
Although budget negotiations are legendary for puffery and posturing, Republicans in the House appear adamant about preserving tax breaks, which many place at the core of their ideological revolution. Today some 80 Republicans sent Speaker Newt Gingrich a letter in which they pledged to vote against any compromise "that fails to balance the budget or significantly diminishes the tax relief passed by the House."
"We're going to insist on capital gains," said Representative David L. Hobson, Republican of Ohio. "We're going to want fairness for senior citizens. We're going to go after the tax difference for marriages."
One House concession, said Mr. Hobson, who advises the chairman of the Budget Committee, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, might involve the scope of the family tax credit, which he predicted would be limited to households with annual earnings below $95,000, or even less. But lowering the earnings ceiling would save a scant amount, because the bulk of families who would benefit from the tax break earn less than $95,000 a year anyway.
The Senate, meanwhile, has made clear that a bone of a few score billion is not enough. Only this week, Republicans joined Democrats to deliver a 69-to-31 thumping to a virtual clone of the House proposal, a $300 billion tax cut offered by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas.
The Senate's chief bargainer, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, is as firmly opposed to tax cuts as Mr. Kasich is for them. Mr. Domenici was silent on the issue today, saying he did not conduct negotiations through newspapers. But the Budget Committee's No. 2 Republican, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, said he believed that the Senate would demand that the House scale back its tax-cut package by at least half -- to $170 billion, say.
"When you're out there in grass-roots America and asking questions, people want to balance the budget by a 2 to 1 margin over tax decreases," he said. Proposing a big tax reduction now, he said, wounds Congress's already bloodied credibility.
But Mr. May, the House committee's staff director, said, "I don't think the guys on our side are going to be happy with $170 billion."
That said, none of those experts appeared to believe today that the tax fracas would destroy the negotiations, as have budget disputes between the House and the Senate in some past years. Mr. Gingrich's spokesman, Tony Blankley, predicted that the party would arrive at a united stance on taxes, and he cast the letter from Republican conservatives as a gesture of support for negotiators, not a threat.
An aide to the House leadership put it another way: "This is typical pre-conference posturing on both sides, which is helpful to the process. Each side stakes out its turf. I think we all recognize the number's going to be somewhere between zero and $350 billion."
The negotiators face additional differences, but Mr. May and others predicted that these would fall like dominoes once the tax question was resolved. They include the following:
MILITARY The House would spend $1.9 trillion on the military through 2002, while the Senate would spend some $70 billion less. Mr. Grassley said he leaned toward the lower figure but predicted that the Senate would give up some of its cuts to satisfy Congress's hawks.
MEDICARE The House would reduce projected spending by $288 billion over seven years, the Senate by $256 billion. Logic, and the powerful lobby of the elderly, suggest that the Senate's figure will carry more weight, experts said.
CRIME The House would reduce contributions to the Violent Crime Trust Fund, established in last year's anti-crime legislation, by $7.8 billion over seven years. The Senate would reallocate to law-enforcement agencies $2.7 billion of those contributions.
HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT The House proposal would shave projected spending by $37 billion through 2002, cutting tenant subsidies, deregulating public housing and turning many programs into block grants. The Senate envisions considerably less paring, $12.2 billion, by cutting some existing block grants and consolidating other programs into new ones.
VETERANS PROGRAMS The House would save some $7.1 billion over seven years by reducing construction of new hospitals and making other changes in medical programs. The Senate would save $9.7 billion by freezing new construction and, like the House, changing medical programs.

 BODY:
The burrito proliferation has leveled off. Two years ago, new places specializing in gargantuan burritos were opening all over Manhattan, and established restaurants were opening branches with abandon. But a consolidation seems to have taken place, with the weaker restaurants closing and fewer new ones opening.
Nonetheless, burritos remain huge, in size at least, and economical. A single burrito -- a soft flour tortilla more than a foot in diameter, stuffed with rice, beans, cheese, guacamole, and meat or shrimp or anything else you can think of -- can be an entire meal, usually for less than $6. What's more, almost every place offers vegetarian burritos, and most even offer nondairy burritos, made with tofu instead of cheese and sour cream. Some also offer alternatives like brown rice and whole-wheat tortillas, although such choices will hardly lower the calorie and fat count of a burrito also laden with sour cream, cheese and guacamole. 
 Here are three burrito specialists in Manhattan.
BERTHA'S. This uptown outpost of the two Benny's Burritos downtown, which has a peace sign etched into the entrance wall, exudes northern California cool. With its big plate glass windows opening onto the Upper West Side, its comfortable couches in front of a carved wood bar and its butcher block tables, high ceiling and white brick wall, this is one of the more pleasant burrito restaurants in New York City, although the noise level can rise when the bar is hopping.
Chips ($2.25) are homemade, puffy and sprinkled with cayenne. They come with a lively, chunky tomato-and-onion salsa. The Bay burrito ($5.95) is fresh and almost impossible to finish, packed with chunks of beef or chicken, beans, rice and the rest. The barbecued pork burrito ($5.95) is less successful. An overly sweet barbecue sauce makes the whole package too moist.
The staff is mellow and alert, offering free refills of the tart homemade lemonade.
CALIFORNIA TACQUERIA. At this branch of a chain that began in Brooklyn, dining is self-service, the amenities are few and the focus is strictly on the food.
That is good news because the East L.A. burrito ($4.75) exudes freshness and flavor, stuffed with yellow rice, a choice of pinto or black beans, and delicious chunks of beef. The tortilla's texture and elasticity are just right, but flimsy plastic utensils can't properly saw through the behemoth burrito. Chips ($1) are thick and homemade, served with fresh salsa.
The pastel-green walls of the dining room are covered with colorful murals, and the ceiling is shiny silver. A display of hubcaps on one wall is a particularly nice California touch.
FLYING BURRITOS. Most of what you need to know about Flying Burritos is on the back of the menu: the restaurant serves 24 kinds of tequila, ranging from $3.50 to $8.50 a shot, and 34 kinds of margaritas, $4.50 to $9.25.
Yes, Flying Burritos is as much bar as restaurant. The dark square room is a study in head-shop kitsch, with black-light portraits of Elvis and Hendrix, a lamp covered in zebra skin and other dormitory favorites of an earlier era. Burritos here are more notable for their mass than for their quality. The Stomping Burrito ($5.95), stuffed with beef, guacamole, rice, beans and cheese, stretches over the ends of a plate but overall is rather insipid.
The margaritas are delicious, though.

HEADLINE: Slowdown Signs Hurt the Dollar, And Stocks Fall

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Fresh news suggesting an economic slowdown -- this time in housing and unemployment --hit the dollar hard and divided stock and bond traders yesterday.
The bond market, which is more fearful of inflation than recession, continued to rise. But stocks fell as the new data led traders to question their assumption that the economy was, in the words of Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, in a "Goldilocks expansion": not too hot to set inflation ablaze yet not cool enough to stop the growth of corporate profits. This view helped lift the blue-chip indexes by more than 15 percent this year. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 25.93 points, to 4,412.23, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.02 point, to 528.59. The Nasdaq composite index, rich in the technology stocks that have recently led the market, nonetheless dropped 0.66 point, to 877.32.
The value of the dollar, which had stabilized for the last few weeks, posted its biggest one-day loss against the German mark since the autumn of 1992, signaling more currency turmoil to come. The dollar dropped sharply against the Japanese yen as well.
Because of the dollar, the value of American stocks held by foreigners plummeted overnight. It was only Wednesday that the Dow rose 15.74 percent in dollars so far this year and 7.47 percent in German marks. Yesterday, the Dow's rise was 15.07 percent in dollars and only 3.88 percent in marks.
While there were one-time factors behind some of the market moves, especially in the currency market, analysts say the markets as a whole may be at a crossroads.
"My feeling, at the very least, is that the stock market is peaking before our eyes," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist for Oppenheimer & Company.
Next week, when more economic reports are due, will carry either more news of economic strength, which will reduce the chances of a Federal Reserve cut in interest rates and could hurt stocks and bonds, or news of more economic weakness, which could also hurt stocks and bonds.
"There is no good news from here on out," Mr. Metz said.
Only a few weeks ago, stocks and bonds marched upward in an almost unbroken advance. The dollar was steady against the mark and Japanese yen, encouraging foreign investors to buy dollar-denominated assets.
Now, some analysts say the economy is slowing too much and possibly hurting corporate profits. More and more traders are heading into next week primed to sell off stocks.
In addition, said Byron Wien, United States investment strategist for Morgan Stanley, "this correction was overdue because the market has gone too far too fast."
The immediate catalysts for yesterday's turbulent markets was a Labor Department report that the four-week average for initial jobless claims had reached its highest level in more than two and a half years. Also, the National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing homes in April dropped to their lowest levels in nearly three years.
These figures, which were far weaker than Wall Street analysts expected, followed Wednesday's report that durable goods orders had fallen more than expected.
Up to this point, the currency markets had largely ignored doubts about a soft landing for the economy. "The foreign exchange market had got sucked into believing that a bottom to the dollar had formed," said David De Rosa, a director of foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation.
Kevin Lawrie, manager of foreign exchange for the Mellon Bank, said, "To pay attention, we really had to be hit over the head with a hammer like the numbers in the durable goods orders and today's numbers."
Moreover, rumors about Mexico and Japan affected the currency markets. "When we walked in this morning, we immediately started hearing rumors about Mexico defaulting on its debt and a middle-tier Mexican bank that was on the skids," said Ramon Bauza, a vice president for foreign exchange for the Bank of Boston. Both rumors proved groundless.
Also, there were rumors that Japan was somehow going to retaliate against the United States in the continuing trade tensions between the two countries and that a German company was selling millions of dollars after an American acquisition had gone sour.
The rumors were especially effective because important European markets, including those of Frankfurt and Paris, were closed for Ascension Thursday. With fewer traders, there was less likelihood of someone buying dollars and thus supporting the price.
In New York, the dollar fell to 1.3969 marks from 1.4385 and to 84.71 yen from 87.18.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.05 point, to 283.93, with advancing stocks lagging declining stocks by 1,048 to 1,149. The American Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.14 point to 491.63.
Among advancing stocks was Legent, a software developer, which rose 13, to 44 1/4, after Computer Associates agreed to acquire Legent for nearly $2 billion. Computer Associates rose 5 7/8, to 71 1/2.
Stocks sensitive to economic downturns dropped as a group. For example, 11 of 12 paper and forest products stocks in the S.& P. 500 fell, led by Louisiana-Pacific, which dropped 4, to 22 3/4. The company said it might be indicted for violations of environmental regulations.
Among declining stocks was System Software, another software developer, which dropped 3515/16 , to 257/16 . Ideon Group, a credit card registration company formerly called Safecard Services, dropped 1 7/8, to 13 3/4. All of the price drop occurred before it announced, after a halt in trading, that it would report lower-than-expected earnings.
The most active stock, at 17.9 million shares, was Novell, a software developer, which dropped 2, to 20 5/8, after the company said sales of a major product, Netware, had fallen.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Reporter's Notebook;
The Lonely Americans, Isolated in a Trade War

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 25

 BODY:
It's not a nice feeling to be alone. And if you were an American trade official in Paris this week, you may have felt remarkably isolated.
The reason was simple. Fellow members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the economic research and policy forum here of 25 of the world's rich nations, do not like the big stick Washington is swinging around as it threatens Japan with trade sanctions -- 100 percent punitive tariffs on 13 luxury-car models -- unless the Japanese open their auto markets. 
 Europeans, conditioned by two world wars fought on their territory, do not like direct confrontation or brinksmanship and are trying to work out a system in which consensus -- or multilateralism, in world trade argot -- solves problems.
They also say that the Americans do not have the force of law on their side, arguing that automotive tariffs are covered by the recently approved world trade accord. And beyond the letter of the agreement, they say, its spirit should discourage one nation from taking action on its own against another.
For their part, the Japanese are tired of American ultimatums on trade issues and do not feel like yielding again.
So the in-your-face American style -- the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, calls himself a "bureaucratic thug" -- does not go over well here -- indeed, it is almost certain to alienate.
The United States position is that the world trade accord does not cover auto distribution and parts purchasing systems, and that anything not covered by the world agreement allows each nation to pursue its interests, according to its own laws.
Thus, as Americans and Japanese tried over the last couple of days to elicit support from their O.E.C.D. colleagues for their respective positions on opening Japan's markets, Clinton Administration officials did not seem to understand why they were being told privately, "Good luck, we wish you well," as Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown said, and then hearing that the same people were criticizing them to other audiences.
That was particularly true between Mr. Kantor and the European Union's trade commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan. Sir Leon became the chief antagonist of the Americans, holding friendly, public chats with Japanese officials while bitterly criticizing Mr. Kantor's threatened sanctions. Many here feared that the auto dispute would now dominate the meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia, starting June 15, of heads of government of the Group of Seven industrial nations.
Staff members here repeatedly complained this week that the Japanese-American trade battle had overshadowed the intended substance of the meeting. And that was indeed the case as several major initiatives and studies seemed to vanish into the ether.
One was a report on the effects of growing third world economies on the West. Some people have expressed fear that if emerging markets like those in Chile, Argentina and India modernize too much, they will become a serious competitive threat to established Western economies, draining manufacturing and high-tech jobs. This is certainly the case already with South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
But the O.E.C.D.'s report found that the benefits far outweigh the negatives because of the enormous consumer buying power that will be unleashed for Western goods and services over the next 15 years.
Look at the combined markets of China, India and Indonesia, three nations with a combined population of 2.25 billion and a combined middle class now of 100 million. The middle class is always at the core of broad economic growth. Given current growth rates, that 100 million will become 700 million by 2010, creating an enormous market for the West.
So what to do? The O.E.C.D. says its members should promote continued economic liberalization in these countries and encourage them to become more and more linked to the international marketplace.
Some of the talk here this week seemed, on the surface, remarkably esoteric -- but important nonetheless. The O.E.C.D. recognizes that while total world trade -- imports and exports -- is significant, the amount of business done by companies that set up plants in other countries -- direct foreign investment -- is more important. Such direct investment in the 1980's increased at a 30 percent annual rate, more than three times the growth rate of world exports and four times as great as overall world economic growth.
Primarily because of agreements like the recent world trade pact and regional trade accords like the North American Free Trade Agreement, trade rules are being standardized and barriers are coming down.
But there are no standards on direct foreign investment that make it easy for one company to set up a plant in another country. Standardize the procedures, get governments to agree on transparent methods of investment, and companies will set up more overseas plants.
The O.E.C.D. has begun a study on a standard direct investment regimen. Sir Leon -- who evidently enjoyed the publicity he got this week -- is insisting that this has to go beyond the exclusive club of the O.E.C.D. and include many of the developing countries.
Thus, it was agreed here that the World Trade Organization, the successor of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, with 124 members, will work on a parallel study in hopes that there will be little difference, in terms of Government red tape, between setting up, say, a glassmaking plant in Mannheim, Germany, and one in Santiago, Chile.
Also lost in the auto battle was a remarkably strong signal sent by Mr. Kantor to the Europeans on Monday, when he spoke to the American Chamber of Commerce in Brussels.
Talk has circulated in Europe for months about starting negotiations on a North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement. The Europeans provide the United States' largest trading region outside North America. There is neither a big deficit nor a big surplus between the two powers, and Europe is the only area of the world where wages are higher than those in the United States.
The Clinton Administration has been slow to focus on this matter, paying primary attention to free-trade initiatives with South American and Pacific Basin countries.
But Mr. Kantor sent the first official signal that the President likes the idea and that the United States sees a free-trade relationship with Europe as essential glue in holding the allies together, with the threat of Communism gone.
The Japanese left the talks on Wednesday relieved at the support they had gotten from the Europeans. But they were not quite celebrating. Although the Americans had been reproved for threatening sanctions, the Europeans had made it clear that Japan needed to do more to open its markets.

Philip Morris Recalls 8 Billion Cigarettes
Philip Morris is recalling more than eight billion cigarettes, including its Marlboro, Virginia Slims and Benson & Hedges brands, because of a defect in their filters that could cause "temporary discomfort" from an irritant that is similar to a commercial pesticide.
 Since there is no way to identify the defective cigarettes by their boxes or cartons, the company asked all smokers of 36 of its cigarette brands to return them to retailers immediately. [Page 6.]
 
Fed Open Market Committee Was Unanimous on Steady Rates
The Fed was unanimous in deciding to hold interest rates steady at the March 28 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, minutes showed. But panel members expressed some willingness to raise the Federal funds rate on overnight bank loans if needed to combat any signs of accelerating inflation. [38.]
 
BBA Group Bids for Paper Maker
BBA Group of Britain offered 443 million Swiss francs, or $390 million, for the Swiss paper maker Holvis Holzstoff, topping a hostile bid of 387 million francs from International Paper. BBA's friendly bid followed the withdrawal Tuesday of a takeover offer by Intertech Group. Both BBA and International Paper particularly want Holvis's nonwoven product used in making diapers, medical gowns and similar products. [36.]
 
Conseco Drops Bid for Bankers
Conseco withdrew its offer to acquire all the publicly traded shares of Bankers Life for $22 a share. Conseco's board had approved buying up to 10 million shares on the open market, where the cost could be lower. The company owns 63.2 percent of Bankers' 52.8 million shares. [39.]
 
Dollar Tumbles on Economic Fear
The dollar tumbled against the Japanese yen and the German mark on fear the American economy was slowing too much. [34.]
 
Oil prices fell 57 cents, to $18.69 a gallon, after a report indicated that a Brazilian oil workers' strike would soon end. [34.]
 
Treasury securities were mixed, weighed down by the falling dollar. Traders moved to cash ahead of the holiday weekend. [38.]
 
Awards for Business Ethics Planned
The Clinton Administration will offer annual awards to companies judged to be complying the best with a voluntary code of ethical practices it issued earlier this year for American corporations doing business overseas. The Model Business Principles urge employers to provide a safe and healthy workplace, avoid discrimination, avoid using child or forced labor and promote free expression. [36.]
 
Nissan Posts a Huge Loss
Nissan reported a group net loss of 166.1 billion yen, or $1.86 billion, almost double its loss of a year earlier. Mazda posted a net loss, for the Japanese parent company only, of 35.8 billion yen, or $400.6 million, but Mitsubishi's net income doubled because of its strong position in Japan's expanding recreational vehicle market. Other Japanese auto makers have also reported gains. [36.]
 
Detroit Considers Downtown Casino
In an effort to revitalize its downtown, Detroit is considering creating an Indian reservation in the heart of the city solely to establish casino gambling there. If approved, it would be the first casino run by Indians anywhere away from their main lands. [6.]
 
Electric Car Sets Distance Record
A four-passenger electric car has set a record for the distance traveled by a battery-powered vehicle without recharging: 238 miles in mixed city-highway driving. The car, the Sunrise, built by Solectria, set the record in the course of the American Tour de Sol, an annual five-day road rally for electric vehicles. [38.]

HEADLINE: Samuel Tamposi, 70, Real Estate Developer, Dies

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Samuel A. Tamposi, who rose from modest beginnings as a farmer and vacuum cleaner salesman to become New Hampshire's largest commercial real estate developer, died at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston on Thursday. He was 70 and lived in Nashua, N.H., and Hernando, Fla.
 The cause of death was lymphoma, said his son, Samuel A. Tamposi Jr. 
 The son of Romanian immigrants, Mr. Tamposi was born in Nashua and raised on the family farm.
 After graduating from high school, he began his career selling Electrolux vacuum cleaners door to door. After several years as a salesman, he began buying up vacant Nashua mill buildings, factories and farmland, including some parcels that sold for as little as $7 an acre.
 Those purchases were the foundation of a real estate empire that at his death stretched from New Hampshire to Florida.
 "He was a man who grew up very poor and had a great love of the land," said former Senator Warren B. Rudman, one of many New Hampshire Republicans to whom Mr. Tamposi contributed during his lifetime. "He loved to build things, things that would be of value."
 Mr. Tamposi made his fortune buying and selling land and persuading Fortune 500 companies like Anheuser-Busch, Digital Equipment and Raytheon to build plants in New Hampshire.
 Mr. Rudman said yesterday that Mr. Tamposi "brought more jobs to New Hampshire than all of the economic authorities in all of the state's cities and townships put together."
 Mr. Tamposi's other great interest was baseball. He was a limited partner in the Boston Red Sox, rarely missing a home game and occasionally traveling with the team.
 In the late 1960's Mr. Tamposi enlisted the help of Ted Williams, the Red Sox star, in the development of Citrus Hills in Florida, a 15,000-acre tract about 75 miles north of Tampa.
 The project was little more than watermelon fields and thick forest when Mr. Tamposi and a partner acquired it in 1968, but now it has two golf courses designed by Arnold Palmer and more than 2,500 houses.
 In addition to Mr. Rudman, the list of Republicans Mr. Tamposi backed includes former President George Bush and John H. Sununu, who was New Hampshire's Governor before joining the Bush Administration in 1989 as White House chief of staff.
 During the Bush Administration, Mr. Tamposi's daughter, Elizabeth M. Tamposi, was head of the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs, which issues passports and visas. During the 1992 Presidential campaign, Ms. Tamposi supervised a search of the passport records of Bill Clinton, an action that generated considerable controversy and led to her dismissal.
 In addition to his children Elizabeth and Samuel, who live in Nashua, Mr. Tamposi is survived by his wife, the former Eileen Maloney; four other children, Michael A., of Nashua, Nicholas E., of West Palm Beach, Fla., Celina Tamposi Griffin of Bedford, N.H., and Stephen A., of Hernando, Fla.; three stepchildren and 19 grandchildren.
 The stepchildren are Richard M. Doyle, Jr. of Boston; Charles R. Doyle of San Francisco and Katharine S. Doyle of Nashua.
 Mr. Tamposi's first marriage, to the former Barbara St. Pierre of Nashua and Palm Beach, Fla., ended in divorce in 1986.

HEADLINE: 10-Minute Clock Keeps Shots Low At G.M. Meeting

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., May 26

 BODY:
When the chairman of the General Motors Corporation muzzled a nun, any shareholder's hopes that G.M. might bend its new rules to limit their speaking time at its annual meeting here surely began to melt away.
 When he did it again, all hopes must have vanished. 
 "Again, Sister, your minute is up," said the chairman, John G. Smale, in his weary, growling baritone.
 Like basketball shot clocks, two digital signs, in glaring red, ticked off the seconds racked up by each outspoken shareholder. Each was held to a total of 10 minutes, in 1- or 3-minute increments.
 Those who overshot found themselves squawking into a dead microphone, as Mr. Smale briskly summoned the next speaker. Control of the mikes gave Mr. Smale a clear victory today in what became a grudge match against a tag team comprising the three most belligerent, loquacious shareholders.
 "I'm not done!" hollered one of the trio, George Sitka of Bristol, Conn., as his 10 minutes elapsed.
 "Well," said Mr. Smale, in a grim tone worthy of Dirty Harry, "yes, you are."
 Closely watched by other companies, G.M. is trying to discipline its historically raucous shareholder meetings, an often flammable blend of business forum, town meeting and cage-match wrestling. In addition to limiting speaking and keeping the entire meeting to two and a half hours, G.M. offered no plant tour to shareholders as it has in the past, and did not even display its vehicles in the Holiday Inn ballroom here. G.M.'s meetings are generally held each year in different cities where the company has assembly plants; the company, the nation's No. 1 auto maker, has a plant in Wilmington.
 "We're moving in the right direction," Harry J. Pearce, an executive vice president, said after the meeting, G.M.'s 87th. "This is a very important part of what corporate governance ought to be in the future."
 Mr. Pearce said G.M. spent only $150,000 on the meeting this year, compared with $1.2 million in 1994. But turnout this year, at 137 people, was the lowest since at least 1948.
 Despite the lower attendance, Mr. Pearce insisted that the new forum allowed G.M. to hear from more shareholders. "We can't allow two or three people to dominate the meeting," he said. He said G.M. hoped to emphasize less formal regional meetings with investors. It intends to hold 12 such meetings this year; some 6,000 shareholders have attended 26 regional meetings since 1993.
 At the meeting, executives were peppered with queries on such matters as how G.M. was protecting shareholders from the Ebola virus, and whether Dr. Jack Kevorkian was damaging the image of the industry by helping people kill themselves in a van. (Mr. Smale said he thought the van was a Chrysler product, although it is actually a Volkswagen.) One gentleman requested a seat on the board; Mr. Sitka requested the resignations of Mr. Smale and John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s president and chief executive, as he had last year.
 Nevertheless, a few interesting details emerged.
In a speech to shareholders, Mr. Smith said G.M. made a contribution of $1.5 billion to its United States pension fund last week, bringing the total of contributions since the beginning of 1994 to $17.2 billion. Based purely on those contributions, G.M.'s unfinanced pension liability would be as low as $3 billion, but lower interest rates and higher pension costs have raised it above that level.
 After the meeting, Mr. Smith also said that G.M. had for the first time reduced its forecast for sales in 1995 to 15.3 million cars and light and heavy trucks, down from 15.6 million. Ford and Chrysler had already cut their much more optimistic estimates several times to reach similar levels.
 And in response to shareholders' questions, executives said G.M. spent $220.6 million on recalls during 1994, and $300 million on fees for outside legal counsel.
 In addition, a group of nuns engaged Mr. Smith and Mr. Smale in a serious discussion of G.M.'s military sales abroad, and whether the company was paying its Mexican workers enough. Mr. Smith said G.M. had raised wages in Mexico by 15 to 30 percent since the devalutation of the peso in December. But the Mexican and United States Governments were discouraging increases, he said, because they could be inflationary in Mexico.
 A more typical, and less illuminating, exchange ensued when Evelyn Y. Davis, a notorious gadfly, asked how much Heidi Kunz, G.M.'s treasurer, and other female executives spent on first-class travel. (Earlier, Mrs. Davis said she was concerned that G.M. was promoting too many women, although only 4 of its 64 officers are women. "What chance does a man have for promotions at General Motors?" she asked, to widespread chortles.)
 Mr. Pearce said G.M. reimbursed executives only for coach fare. But Mrs. Davis's question about Ms. Kunz prompted another shareholder, Joan Cockerton of Michigan, to approach the mike.
 First, Mrs. Cockerton apologized for removing her shoes, saying that her feet hurt. Then she asked, "Who is Heidi Fleiss?"
 Mr. Smale gently explained that she was mixing up names. Mrs. Cockerton then said she was glad to discover that Mr. Smale was not a stuffed shirt.
 "It's hard to be a stuffed shirt in this situation," Mr. Smale said.
 The new rules did not delight all shareholders. Sister Barbara Glendon, an Ursuline nun from New York, told Mr. Smale that she understood there was a "creative tension" between allowing shareholders a voice and running an efficient meeting.
 But "if we have to be a little off-balance on one of them," she said, G.M. should err on the side of letting people speak. "It could be done in a better way," she said.

HEADLINE: An Indian Reservation? Right in Detroit?

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 21

 BODY:
Detroit has tried for decades to revitalize its moribund downtown, but never before with so novel an approach as a proposal now on Gov. John Engler's desk: to create an Indian reservation in the heart of the city solely to establish casino gambling there.
Michigan law prohibits casino gambling, but Federal law provides an exemption: states that permit any form of organized gambling, like Michigan's lottery, must permit gaming operations run by Indians on sovereign Indian lands, as opposed to private or commercial land owned by Indians. If approved, Federal officials say, the casino here will be the first casino gambling enterprise run by Indians anywhere away from their main lands. 
 Detroiters, frustrated by decades of decay, unemployment and a dwindling tax base but leery of gambling's harmful trappings, have mixed feelings. The voters rejected gambling initiatives four times. But after casinos opened last year in nearby Windsor, Ontario, and began drawing 25,000 people a day across the Detroit River, the voters had a change of heart.
By a two-thirds majority in a referendum last August, they approved a proposal, which had the backing of Mayor Dennis Archer and the City Council, to transfer land in the Greektown area downtown to a Chippewa tribe for the purpose of establishing an Indian-run casino there. The voters also approved a riverboat casino, but state law would have to be changed before that could be allowed.
The Rev. Jim Holley, pastor of the Little Rock Missionary Baptist Church near downtown, who opposed the ballot initiatives, said pragmatism had won out over principle.
"When you've got a million dollars a day going over to Windsor, which is a few blocks of water away," Mr. Holley said, "the people saw it as something that was already here, but the city wasn't benefiting from it." Mr. Holley served on an 11-member commission, appointed by Governor Engler, that concluded that Indian-run casinos would benefit the city. "They figured that they already had gamblers in Detroit," he said. "They just didn't have gambling in Detroit."
The willingness to risk for economic good the social ills that critics warn accompany gambling districts is a measure of the desperation many people feel about the longtime plight of Detroit's derelict city center. The city's unemployment rate is 15 percent, and an estimated third of its population of one million live at or below the poverty level. The Greektown proposal promises 4,400 jobs reserved for Detroiters, $25 million a year to city coffers and additional millions for economic development projects.
The exodus of department stores and business offices from Detroit began with the marriage of cars to new freeways in the 1950's and accelerated after the riots of the 1960's. Each decade since has had its own ambitious plan to bring people and prosperity back, none of them successful.
In the 1970's, it was Henry Ford 2d's Renaissance Center, the soaring, cylindrical twin hotel and office towers. But the "Ren-Cen" keeps its visitors indoors, and nearly two decades later the nighttime streets around it are as empty as before.
In the 1980's, it was the People Mover, several miles of elevated tramway subsidized by Washington to encourage visitors to tour downtown. But by then there were few places worth visiting, and riders gazing at eye level into the empty upper floors of the relics of pre-World War II Detroit commerce were left with the impression that this was a city that had moved out of town.
Now gambling is being heralded as the catalyst for renewal. So far, three competing groups, including the one whose specific plans were approved at referendum last August, are vying for the right to deed various parcels of downtown land to the Chippewa for a casino.
While the investors would not own, operate or directly profit from a casino, they would expect to reap the spinoff profits from the casino crowds and the hotels, restaurants and shops on adjacent land they owned. And, despite awareness that casinos in Atlantic City have not delivered broad prosperity, voters here are evidently counting on the promoters' scenario to reverse decades of decay and provide much-needed jobs.
John Kelly, a lawyer and former Democratic State Senator who opposed gambling when he was in the Legislature but is now working with one of the investor groups, said the presence of Canadian casinos across the river had been persuasive to him and many other Detroiters. Since gambling is, in effect, already here, the rationale goes, Detroit ought to reap some profit from it rather than watch its people -- and their money -- cross the border.
Still, the odor that surrounds gambling dictates that political leaders speak reluctantly of the proposal as a last resort, though even among opponents the betting is that Governor Engler, a Republican, will not stop the project when he makes his decision, perhaps by the end of June, on whether to accept in trust for the Chippewa 135,000 square feet of Greektown land offered by two developers for a casino. He is also weighing other proposals, though it is expected he would not sanction them without another referendum.
"The Governor is not necessarily enamored of gambling and doesn't consider this a panacea for Detroit's problems," said John Truscott, Mr. Engler's spokesman. "But he is certainly willing to consider it as an option."
Detroit draws substantial financial aid from the state, and so improving the city's economy, Mr. Kelly said, could make Mr. Engler's budget-balancing much easier.
So far, the two developers from the near east side's Greektown area, Jim Pappas and Ted Gatzeros, appear furthest along in their plans, with the Sault Ste. Marie tribe of Chippewa as partners. It was this proposal that the voters approved last August, and it has the blessing of the United States Department of the Interior, whose agreement, along with that of a state governor, is required before land can be placed in trust for an Indian tribe. The two developers have already transformed several old warehouses in Greektown into a lively nightspot, with a hotel, several restaurants and a small design center.
Another group -- known as the Foxtown group, for a development in the old theater district farther from the river -- is working on a proposal to offer other Michigan Indians land in Foxtown. They are following the lead of Mike Ilitch, the owner of the Detroit Tigers baseball team and the Detroit Red Wings hockey team. He has invested millions to refurbish the Fox Theater as the headquarters of his Little Caesar's Pizza empire and wants to have a new stadium for his baseball team built nearby.
The leagues in which Mr. Ilitch's professional sports enterprises compete forbid owners to be associated with a casino project. But his investment in the area would leave him in a position to profit from the spinoff traffic.
The third initiative is that of Mr. Kelly and his partners, who want to transform the former Hudson's Department Store building into a two-million-square-foot multilevel wedding cake of gambling, shopping, dining and a hotel.
"This is what the city needs," said Jim Butsikaris, owner of the Lindell Athletic Club, a sports bar that lies between Hudson's and Foxtown. "If we don't get people down here in the evening, we won't survive."
A spokesman for the Chippewa, John Hatch, described Detroit as one of the biggest untapped gaming markets in North America. "And," he said, "it is the only urban market that has passed a referendum on casino gaming."
But dissenters remain wary.
"In Detroit, we always get it backwards," said Fred Rashid, an English professor at Marygrove College and the president of a group, Fans of Tiger Stadium, that is trying to block Mr. Ilitch from moving his baseball team. "We always think that the big project is the one thing that's going to do the job. We have paid dearly for the absence of careful planning."

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
It was unlike any other event associated with the White House Conference on Trade and Investment in Ireland: A diminutive, rosy-faced Irish Archbishop and a bearded Presbyterian official joined in a conversation that veered wildly from the nuts and bolts of fair employment practices and investment opportunities to abstruse talk of "ontological individualism" and Trinitarian theology.
But in a world where religion so often opens wounds, one can hardly overlook religious leaders striving to close them. 
 "If we could find solutions" in Northern Ireland, said Cahal Cardinal Daly, Archbishop of Armagh, Primate of the Roman Catholic Church for all of Ireland, "it would have important lessons, I think, for the rest of Europe." He was addressing a news briefing on Wednesday with the Rev. John Dunlop, a former moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, at the National Press Club in Washington.
In January 1994, Cardinal Daly and Dr. Dunlop issued a joint call for strong fair employment measures and more investment in Northern Ireland. In some ways the joint call foreshadowed the Washington conference. Also signed by Irish Methodist and Anglican leaders, the joint call linked peace with economics and brought together leaders from contending factions.
More importantly, the call yoked what had been viewed as rival approaches. Catholics and nationalists had focused on job discrimination while Protestants and unionists had treated investment as the issue.
Both Cardinal Daly and Dr. Dunlop have faced opposition within their own churches. In an interview after the briefing, the Cardinal recalled how his denunciations of nationalist violence had provoked "a great deal of what you call hate mail," especially from those "who regarded me a betraying my own people.
"That's the interesting phrase -- 'my own people' -- and they are not my people," he said. The letter writers "just couldn't understand why I would be concerned about the rights of Protestants," he said.
Religious leaders have "to preach the Gospel in season or out of season, welcome or unwelcome," Cardinal Daly said, although "that can pose real pastoral problems."
Dr. Dunlop interjected: "It's sometimes described as a tension between the prophetic element of preaching and the pastoral element. You musn't lose contact with your base, but you musn't lose your integrity to maintain contact with your base. Neat trick."
Yet Cardinal Daly and Dr. Dunlop finally spoke less of bold preaching than of sensitive listening as the key to peacemaking. Each of the two communities in Northern Ireland, they explained, had distinct identities -- Protestant and unionist, Catholic and nationalist -- shaped by different stories.
"They are stories about suffering and about pain," Dr. Dunlop said at the news briefing. "And of course if you can establish the fact that your community alone is the only community that suffers, then you occupy the moral high ground, and there is an enormous amount of political capital that comes from that occupation.
"But whenever the Cardinal and I talk to one another, and whenever our two communities start to tell one another's stories, we begin to understand that the pain is not exclusively the domain of one community."
The challenge for the churches, he said, is "to create the opportunity for these stories to be told" and to enable their people to tell their stories in a way that others can hear "because if you tell a story in order to win an argument, a counter-story will be told against you, and the conflict will intensify."
If Ireland had long harbored two communities divided by a common faith, won't the rapid secularization it is undergoing end that? "That might create more psychic space for my community," Dr. Dunlop said. "If Ireland is understood ideologically as a homogeneous Catholic nationalist state, there's not an awful lot of room in it for somebody like me."
"And yet the Catch-22 is that secularization is not good for any kind of faith," he continued. "With regard to the young people in my congregation, none of them have ever become Catholics in my time, but a great many of them have stopped practicing the Christian faith altogether.
"So if I go around in Ireland thinking that Cardinal Daly's Christian community is the main threat to my existence, then I'm looking in the wrong direction."
And what about "ontological individualism?" Dr. Dunlop borrowed the phrase from the American sociologist Robert Bellah to contrast the idea of an isolated individual prior to all social relationships with the idea of an individual "made in the image of a God who is Trinitarian, Father, Son and Holy Spirit."
The concept of a person made in the image of a God "who has existed in unity and community from the very beginning" implied "a society which is interested in relationships," he said, "not a society which is dominated by power and by coercion."
The representative of the American National Conference of Catholic Bishops, which had helped organize the briefing, looked amused at this heavy serving of theology. He promised a free lunch, he said, to any journalists getting "ontological individualism" into their lead paragraph.

HEADLINE: U.S. Provides First Details Of Its Business Ethics Code

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration today disclosed its plans for encouraging American and foreign companies to respect the voluntary code of ethical practices it issued earlier this year for American corporations doing business overseas.
 The Commerce Department said it would offer annual awards to American companies judged to be complying the best with these guidelines. The first award will be made early next year and the search for the winning companies will start in September. The Commerce Department did not say what form the awards would take. 
 The Model Business Principles, as the voluntary business ethics code is called, urges employers to provide a safe and healthy workplace, avoid discrimination on race, religion or sex, avoid the use of child labor or forced labor and promote free expression.
 But it is vague about urging companies to respect a worker's right to organize and stops short of asking companies to encourage such activity.
 In addition to the Administration's statement, a San Francisco organization called Business for Social Responsibility plans to create a privately financed clearinghouse for information about other codes of business conduct. The clearinghouse will provide information and advice to companies planning to develop their own codes of conduct.
 The Administration will also work with Business for Social Responsibility to organize conferences and seminars at which business leaders will be instructed in the Clinton Administration's code and encouraged to draw up their own guidelines based on its principles.
 The Administration also plans to encourage foreign governments to draw up similar guidelines for their own companies and will seek international support for its code in such bodies as the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the International Labor Organization in Geneva.
 The Administration will also seek support for its ethics code from the President's Export Council, a group of chief executive officers who advise the President on issues affecting foreign trade.
 In an effort to show that American business is coming to accept the new code after expressing strong reservations in the past, the Commerce Department today issued a list of the companies that it said supported the code "as a useful reference point for framing the codes of conduct of individual businesses."
 These companies include the Boeing Company, Honeywell Inc., the General Electric Company, the Westinghouse Electric Company, the Eastman Kodak Company, the Rockwell International Corporation and the Loral Corporation.
 President Clinton first promised such a voluntary code of conduct last year in an attempt to meet the complaints of human rights activists' angry over his decision to renew China's most-favored-nation trade status despite criticism of Beijing's human rights record.
 To avoid seeming to be singling out China, however, the Administration decided to make the code applicable to American companies' business dealings with all countries.
 Today human rights activists welcomed the Administration's plans as "a useful first step toward encouraging U.S.-based businesses to adopt voluntary codes of conduct governing their activities abroad."
But the statement by Amnesty International USA, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights and the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights regretted the lack of governmental involvement in the proposed clearinghouse and said the Administration "has not taken sufficient steps to press for the protection of human rights in China."

HEADLINE: Stock Prices Tumble for A Second Day

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market extended its losses for a second consecutive session yesterday, setting off the so-called circuit-breaker rules of the New York Stock Exchange twice in one session. But leading stock indexes still managed to finish ahead for the week.
 Contributing to the drop in prices yesterday were declines in bonds and the dollar, prompting a small rush to gold, whose price is the fever chart of market anxiety. 
 Moreover, traders seem to continue believing that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this year. Such a cut could send the dollar plummeting further because it would pay less interest to foreign investors. "The dollar could prevent the Fed from easing," said Jay Goldinger, market strategist for Capital Insight in Beverly Hills, Calif.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 43.23 points yesterday, to 4,369.00, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 4.94 points, to 523.65. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 5.45 points, to 871.87.
 For the week, the Dow climbed 27.67 points, while the S.& P. 500 was up 4.46 points and the Nasdaq, 7.3 points.
 Next week will be a test for the financial markets, analysts said. At least five major economic reports are due: a preliminary revision of the first-quarter gross domestic product, April new-home sales and May consumer confidence, chain-store sales and employment data.
 It was difficult to draw many conclusions from the movements of the financial markets this week. As was the case last week, when stock trading was distorted by the quarterly expiration of options, one-time factors seemed to be at work.
 Thin trading also tended to magnify price movements. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange, for example, was a light 291.2 million shares yesterday, the bulk of it before 1 P.M. The long Memorial Day weekend as well as a wildcat railroad strike in New York prompted an early exit from Wall Street. "People were just getting out of the way of a three-day weekend," said David Holt, vice president for research and strategy at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles.
 After rising for four consecutive sessions, bond prices fell, pushing up yields and helping attract money away from stocks. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.75 percent from 6.72 percent.
 The dollar fell to 82.94 Japanese yen from 84.71 yen and to 1.3787 German marks from 1.3969 marks. Gold settled at $386.60 an ounce, up from $383.10 at the beginning of the week.
 Despite the decline in stocks, most surveys of market sentiment still show investors unusually bullish, said Todd Clark, managing director for equity trading at Rodman & Renshaw.
 Stocks may have risen too far, he said, which means there would have to be more of a correction before new money will come into the market and move prices higher. "We could still use some work on the down side," he said.
 Such concerns may have prompted the Dow to fall as much as 56.38 points by 3:30 P.M. The Dow was down more than 50 points at 11 A.M. setting off the Big Board's circuit- breaker rules, which are intended to slow high-speed computer-guided trading. The rules took effect again at 2:58 P.M.
 The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.35 points, to 281.58, with advancing stocks lagging behind declining stocks by 849 to 1,356. The American Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.89 point, to 490.74.
 Among the advancing stocks was Applied Innovation, a telecommunications equipment maker, which rose 4 1/4, to 38 1/4. On Thursday, Wheat First Butcher Singer recommended it as a buy.
 The American depository receipts of Kubota, the heavy-equipment maker, rose 7, to 142, after it reported higher earnings.
 Among the declining stocks was Chipcom, a computer-equipment maker, which dropped 11 7/8, to 20 1/8, after it said lower shipments of its products by I.B.M. would hurt profits. Chipcom was also the most active stock, at 10.2 million shares.
 Ideon Group, a credit-card registration company, fell 4 5/8, to 9 1/8. Ideon, which changed its name from Safecard Services on May 1, said it expected to report lower 1995 earnings.
 In Japan, stocks ended slightly higher. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 114.81 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, at 15,694.25.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Japan Inc.'s Dying Bit Players;
Rising Yen Is Wreaking Havoc on Small Factories

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 26

 BODY:
Tomohiro Koseki is one of the unsung heroes of this nation's industrial miracle. A journeyman metal worker, Mr. Koseki can craft a turbine blade or a shaft to a precision of less than the thickness of a human hair. He has also written books celebrating the Japanese metal-working artisan. But Mr. Koseki, 62, said such craftsmen were now a dying breed.
In this city's Ota Ward, where he works, many of the small metal-working factories are falling victim to hard times and the soaring yen, leaving a feeling of helplessness, "like a carp on a cutting board." His own employer has only eight workers left, down from 20 a few years ago. 
 For all the focus on how the rising yen is hurting powerful exporters like Honda and Hitachi, the impact is far worse on the small, anonymous manufacturers supplying the parts to the brand-name giants. The small factories either cut the prices of their parts to help the big companies maintain their profits or they lose business when the bigger companies relocate factories offshore.
 Yet these small factories have been instrumental in making Japan Inc. what it is -- an efficient producer of high-quality goods. And as their numbers keep on dropping, there is growing fear that Japan is losing some of its fundamental manufacturing know-how and possibly its ability to produce new products in the future.
 National and local officials, as well as the companies themselves, are devising countermeasures. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is offering loans as well as advice to small factories.
 In Ota Ward, the local government formed a special task force to come up with ways to preserve the factories. Tadao Kamiya, a ward official, said the goal was not to keep all the factories but rather a "manufacturing minimum" -- enough to insure that know-how gets passed to the next generation. One plan is for the ward to give loans to factories to help master craftsmen train younger workers.
 The ebbing of the manufacturing culture in Japan is being played out in Ota Ward, an area in southern Tokyo that is home to more than 7,000 small, mostly metal-working factories, 80 percent of them with fewer than 10 employees. These are not the direct suppliers to the big companies, but second- or third-tier ones.
 In the last decade, more than 2,000 factories have vanished from Ota Ward, driven out of business, or at least out of Tokyo, by land prices, recession, difficulties in recruiting workers and the rise of the yen.
 In one sense, Ota Ward is to metal working in Japan what Silicon Valley is to electronics in the United States. Just as Silicon Valley has the engineers, programmers and financiers who can join to create electronic products, so Ota Ward has a network of specialized workers to supply virtually any metal part, often quickly and in lots as small as one.
 The factories can share jobs, allowing them to accept bigger and more complex orders than any one shop could handle by itself.
 "The high level of technology arises because these small factories complement one another," said Atsuhiko Takeuchi, a professor of geography at the Nippon Institute of Technology, near Tokyo. "In that regard, this is the only place where such a concentration exists."
 Kuwashi Otomo, who owns a small grinding shop in Ota Ward, cited an instance of such industrial networking -- a complex valve that is part of a machine used to make computer chips in South Korea. Eight companies in Mr. Otomo's neighborhood teamed up to make the valve, with one doing the specialized welding, another the screw, and so on.
 Mr. Otomo said the valve could not yet be made in South Korea or other Asian nations with lower wages. The same is true, experts said, of many high-precision parts used in aviation, electric power generation and electronics equipment.
 But run-of-the-mill parts, like pins and screws, can be made offshore, and such work is leaving Japan. Mitsuhiro Seki, a professor at Senshu University, said that Japan was losing its "full set" industrial structure, in which it made virtually all components by itself, and would be more fully integrated with the economies of other Asian nations.
 American parts suppliers could also benefit as the big Japanese companies move more of their manufacturing -- of cars, machine tools and electronics -- to the United States.
 The Ricoh Company, the office equipment maker, is now importing 10 percent of its parts, from China and elsewhere, up from 2 percent a few years ago, although the heart of a copier machine, a specially coated aluminum cylinder, can still be made only in Japan. The company has urged its 350 local suppliers, one- tenth of whom are in Ota Ward, to adopt more sophisticated technology or face losing business.
 Takahide Kaneko, general manager of Ricoh's purchasing division, noted that salaries in China are one-tenth or one-fifteenth of those in Japan. Senior craftsmen in Ota Ward can make more than 5 million yen a year. In the last four months, the dollar equivalent of that has risen to $60,000 from $50,000.
 The pressures on small companies are heightened because many of them borrowed heavily during Japan's speculative boom of the late 1980's to buy new computerized machine tools, which can cost $100,000 apiece.
 "At the peak I was boasting to people that debt is a barometer of your power -- it shows how creditworthy you are," said Norihide Fujita, 50, a factory owner.
 Mr. Fujita's company makes metal molds for one customer, Fujikura Ltd., which uses the molds to stamp out printed circuit boards. The boards are sold to another company making speedometers for Nissan cars.
 But in 1989 Fujikura moved part of its operations to Thailand, even studying Mr. Fujita's shop to set up its own metal mold operation there.
 Mr. Fujita's sales have dropped to 80 million yen, or about $1 million, from 140 million yen a few years ago. Since January, he said, four of his eight workers had quit. And these days Mr. Fujita can afford to pay only interest, not the principal, on his loans.
 "Actually, we want to quit but we cannot because of the debt," Mr. Fujita said. "Probably most of the factories in Ota Ward are in that situation."
 The constant pressure to cut costs has strained what is supposed to be a harmonious, long-term relationship between the big companies and their suppliers.
 Manufacturers are forcing the small companies to bid against one another, and suppliers who cannot meet demands for price reductions are losing business. Mr. Otomo, the grinding shop owner, said the big companies often unilaterally cut prices or changed the terms of an agreement.
 "They say orally that an order will continue for a year," he said. "It never continues for a year."
 Recruiting is another problem. In Ota Ward's heyday -- during Japan's high-growth years of the 1950's through the 1970's -- 15-year-old junior high school graduates known as "golden eggs" would arrive in Tokyo from the hinterlands and find work in metal shops. After they became skilled craftsmen, many would go into business for themselves.
 But nowadays, affluent and well-educated Japanese young people shun factory work. At Mr. Koseki's factory, the eight remaining employees are all more than 50 years old. Teiichi Matsuda, the factory owner, said he had given up trying to find young blood. So it is a matter of time before the factory shuts down.
 The real estate boom in the late 1980's created more problems. It forced some factories to move to outlying areas with cheaper rents. Some owners converted their factories to more lucrative apartments. (There are few zoning restrictions in Japan.) Since Ota Ward is in the middle of a big metropolis, defunct factories quickly give way to office buildings or shops. So the area has avoided the fate of Bridgeport, Conn., which turned into an urban basket case when its factories shut down.
 Masahito Ohma now manages an apartment house built on the site of the factory he closed in 1990. The factory, started by Mr. Ohma's father in 1951, made lenses and other camera parts but suffered as Japanese camera makers began buying parts from Taiwan and Southeast Asia. The company, which had 150 employees, could not meet the camera makers' demands to cut its prices 40 percent.
 "When we said we could not cut prices further, orders stopped coming," Mr. Ohma said. "At our peak we were making 5,000 lenses a month but it dropped to the 1,000 to 2,000 level. The most difficult thing in making the decision was that we felt so bad toward our workers."
 To survive, some companies are looking for products they can sell themselves, rather than continue solely as parts suppliers. Here, the networks in Ota Ward come in handy. Mr. Fujita's company and 10 others recently teamed up to develop a nozzle that when attached to a vacuum cleaner sucks the air out of plastic soft-drink bottles for recycling.
 Mr. Fujita said Ota Ward should try to advertise itself as a parts supplier to the world, not just Japan. "It's so sad to just sit here and see the town losing factories," he said. "We have to move."

HEADLINE: Fed Panel Was Unanimous For Steady Rates in March

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers were unanimous at their March 28 meeting in deciding to hold interest rates steady, according to the minutes of the session that were released today.
 But the policy makers, members of the Federal Open Market Committee, did express a willingness to raise the Federal funds rate on overnight bank loans if needed to combat any signs of accelerating inflation, the minutes show. 
 "There remained a risk that higher inflation could emerge if the expansion did not moderate sufficiently," the minutes said. "On the whole, the economy appeared to retain considerable forward momentum."
 Still, the panel left the Federal funds rate unchanged, as it did at its most recent meeting, on Tuesday.
 The last time the panel voted for a rate increase was at its meeting on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1.
 The policy-making committee normally meets eight times a year. Its deliberations are held in secret, and the minutes of the meeting are released several weeks later -- after the subsequent meeting of the committee.
 The committee next meets July 5 and 6. A growing number of economists say Fed officials may be prompted to lower rates at that session because the economy could be teetering on the edge of recession.
 At the March meeting, committee members expressed concern about the decline of the dollar and whether that "would add to inflationary pressures in the economy," the minutes said.
 "In these circumstances, the members generally concluded that some increase in inflation was likely in the coming months," the minutes said.
 And though Fed officials remained concerned about the weakness of the dollar against other leading currencies, "they believed that policy should not be directed toward the achievement of a specific level for the dollar but rather toward the implementation of an effective anti-inflationary monetary policy," the minutes reported.

HEADLINE: 3 Convicted In Mob Plot To Cheat U.S. Of Gas Taxes

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 26

 BODY:
Three men, including an associate of John Gotti, were convicted today of defrauding the Government of more than $100 million in gasoline taxes in a huge scheme that provided new evidence of the growing ties between the Italian Mafia and emerging Russian organized-crime groups.
 In a five-month trial, jurors were taken into a world of tribute money paid to New York's largest Mafia families, threats of violence and arson, and a sting operation set up by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service. 
 Mob members provided protection to the black-market companies, helped control competition and handled price-fixing, witnesses testified. The Government maintained that the Gambino, Genovese, Colombo and Lucchese families split proceeds from bootleg gasoline transactions.
 In an undercover operation, F.B.I. and I.R.S. agents set up a company, Packer Petroleum in Ewing Township, to compete with the bootleg oil dealers. The undercover agents were pressured by the black-market operators to team up with the bootleg organization -- in which case they would receive $165,000 -- or go out of business, said an Assistant United States Attorney, Robert G. Stahl.
 The undercover company burned down in February 1992 in a fire of suspicious origin.
 The Government charged that phantom companies were set up for a few months at a time with forged I.R.S. registration forms, indicating that they were entitled to sell fuel without paying taxes. To hide the origin of the transactions, fuel was sold from company to company in a chain. Since the illegal companies saved 20 to 37 cents a gallon on tax, they were able to manipulate the market price and make large profits.
 The three defendants -- Gregory Federico, Anthony Morelli and Igor Roizman -- were found guilty in United States District Court here of racketeering acts and extortion, United States Attorney Faith S. Hochberg said. She said the companies avoided paying taxes on hundred of millions of gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel and laundered $48 million.
 Videotapes played in court showed Mr. Morelli speaking with John Gotti, the boss of the Gambino crime family, at the Ravenite Social Club in Little Italy.
 The Government maintained that Mr. Morelli collected tribute money from motor fuel bootleggers for the Gambino crime family. Mr. Morelli was convicted today of racketeering, extortion, money laundering, mail fraud and wire fraud.
 Mr. Federico, who owned and operated Capital Fuel Service in Cranford, N.J., was accused of supplying diesel fuel to the black-market oil companies. He was convicted of racketeering, money laundering, mail and wire fraud, tax evasion and extortion.

HEADLINE: BBA Group Bids $390 Million To Acquire Swiss Paper Maker

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: BASEL, Switzerland, May 26

 BODY:
The BBA Group P.L.C. of Britain bid 443 million Swiss francs ($390 million) today for the Swiss paper maker Holvis Holzstoff A.G., topping a hostile offer of 387 million francs from the International Paper Company.
 BBA's friendly bid followed the withdrawal Tuesday of an offer by the Intertech Group Inc. for Holvis, which has been seeking other suitors since International Paper made its offer on April 24. 
 Both International Paper and BBA are after Holvis's paper-fiber business. The product, known as nonwoven, is used in disposable diapers, surgical gowns and other medical products.
 "Babies need diapers irrespective of economic cycles," said Roberto Quarta, BBA's chief executive.
 Holvis endorsed the BBA proposal, valued at 500 francs a share, and 15 percent above the 435-franc-a-share hostile offer by International Paper, the world's largest forest-products company.
 International Paper said it would not respond until it had a chance to study BBA's offer in detail. International Paper's offer expires on Tuesday. The company has already acquired 25 percent of Holvis at 435 francs a share and has an option on 6 percent more.
 If International Paper chooses not to make a higher bid, it could exercise its option and sell BBA nearly a third of the outstanding shares at a profit of 65 francs each, or 14 million francs.
 Holvis said that shareholders who might have already tendered or sold shares to International Paper had the right under Swiss takeover law to revoke their decisions once BBA had publicized its formal offer, on Monday at the latest. The deadline to revoke tendered shares is noon the following day.
 BBA shares closed up 17.5 pence, at 235.5 pence, and Holvis shares closed up 47 francs, at 492 francs. International Paper stock closed down 25 cents, to $78.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 "It looks to be a very good acquisition for BBA," said David Buxton, an analyst at Henry Cooke, Lumsden P.L.C. in Manchester. "They will get direct commercial benefits."
 Holvis's Fiberweb unit posted an operating profit of 17.1 million francs in 1994 on revenue of 306 million francs. Muehlebach earned 13.7 million francs on 379 million francs in sales. BBA said it would merge Fiberweb with its Reemay nonwovens business, based in Nashville.
 Fiberweb's profit margins are about 6 percent, and BBA can raise those to "double digit range," Mr. Quarta said.

HEADLINE: Conseco Goes to Open Market To Acquire Bankers Life Shares

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Conseco Inc. said yesterday that it had withdrawn its offer to acquire all the publicly traded shares of the Bankers Life Holding Corporation for $22 a share but that its board had approved buying up to 10 million shares on the open market.
 Conseco, which is based in Carmel, Ind., and provides finacial services to life insurance companies, already owns 63.2 percent of the 52.8 million shares outstanding in Bankers, which sells mostly health insurance. 
 The balance of Bankers' stock, about 19.5 million shares, is publicly traded. The shares fell 87.25 cents, to $20.50, before trading was halted on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. Thus, Conseco may be able to buy some of the shares more cheaply on the open market.
 Conseco shares fell 75 cents, to $44.62; trading was also halted in its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
 James Rosensteele, the vice president of investor relations, said that buying 10 million more shares would give Conseco more than 80 percent of Bankers Life and that there were tax benefits at that ownership level.
 Stephen J. Hilbert, the chairman of Conseco, said that after meeting with the independent committee and Bankers' financial advisers it beame evident that Bankers was not going to approve the proposal to buy the rest of the stock at $22 a share.
 "Under the circumstances, it didn't make sense for us to continue our discussions," he said.
 "We continue to believe that the price we offered represented full and fair value to the public shareholders of B.L.H."
 Conseco, which has grown rapidly through acquisitions, can buy large blocks of existing life insurance policies more cheaply than it can generate internally. It also owns 42 percent of CCP Insurance Inc.
 In November, Conseco terminated a $2.96 billion takeover bid for the Kemper Corporation after a rise in interest rates increased the cost of financing the takeover attempt, and some shareholders opposed the move.

HEADLINE: Pre-Holiday Caution Weighs on Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended mixed yesterday in a shortened session ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend.
 The market was weighed down for a second day by a falling dollar, which makes securities less attractive to foreign investors. Traders said the market was also vulnerable to weakness because of the normal unwinding of positions before a long weekend. Most market participants prefer to hold large amounts of cash going into long weekends. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 13/32 , to 1115/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.75 percent, from 6.72 percent on Thursday. For the week, the yield was down 17 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 Trading was light yesterday as the futures market closed at 1 P.M. and the cash market closed at 2 P.M.
 Bond prices were hurt by a report that suggested a pickup in inflation. The Labor Department said yesterday that import prices rose 1.2 percent in April, the sharpest increase since October 1990. Prices rose a revised five-tenths of 1 percent in March.
 The increase in import prices, said James Hale, fixed-income analyst with MMS International in San Francisco, is "particularly worrisome because it suggests that the weak dollar is already causing inflation in imported goods, which could feed into the U.S. economy as a whole."
 Other data released yesterday had less of an impact on the market. The University of Michigan released its consumer sentiment index, which came in as expected, at 89.8 for May, up from a preliminary reading of 88.4, according to traders who saw the report. The April index was 92.5. And the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia released a survey of regional activity that suggested a slight rise in consumer prices over the next five quarters.
 Mr. Hale of MMS International said the recent rally in Treasury securities seemed to run out of fuel yesterday as portfolio managers began taking profits.
 "This corrective, or negative, atmosphere in bonds has been encouraged by the sharp dollar declines of the past two days," he said. "Shorter-maturity Treasuries were less affected by the weak dollar, though, because the inflationary implications were offset by the prospect for central bank buying of notes and bills with the proceeds of foreign exchange intervention."
 The dollar fell 2 percent against the Japanese yen yesterday and 1 percent against the German mark.
 In the municipal market, bonds were little changed as demand from investors in tax-exempt bond funds continued to decline. Traders said many investors had been reluctant to buy bonds as yields lingered near their lowest level in more than a year. The yield on 10-year insured revenue bonds rose 2 basis points, to 5.22 percent, according to the PSA/Bloomberg municipal bond yield table, which measures yields on insured revenue bonds. That was just above the 13-month low in yields seen during the last two weeks.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Takes Another Big Fall On Worry About U.S. Economy

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled against the Japanese yen and the German mark for a second day yesterday as concerns grew that a slowing United States economy could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.
 And the weakness in the dollar widened yesterday, with the currency posting declines of more than 1.5 percent against the Swiss franc, more than 2 percent against the French franc and more than 4 percent against the Dutch guilder. 
 "The dollar's looking pretty sick," said Andrew Hodge, vice president at Bank Brussels Lambert in New York. The fall was prompted by "increasing thoughts of a weak U.S. economy, plus Europeans getting nervous about the possibility of Fed interest-rate cuts," he said.
 The dollar fell as low as 82.45 yen, its lowest since April 26, before settling in New York trading at 82.94 yen, down from 84.71 yen on Thursday. The dollar fell to 1.3787 marks from 1.3969 marks. The dollar also fell to 4.8553 French francs from 4.9664 francs; to 1.1359 Swiss francs from 1.1557 francs, and to 1.5404 Dutch guilders from 1.6095 guilders.
 The decline in the dollar began after a report on Thursday showed a bigger-than-expected decline in orders for durable goods, suggesting that the economy might be weakening to a point where the Fed would have to cut short-term interest rates. Lower rates often hurt the dollar by making deposits denominated in it less attractive.
 Still, the dollar had rallied in recent weeks, with currency dealers encouraged by efforts in Congress to cut the budget deficit and the Clinton Administration's confrontation with Japan over automotive trade. But the rapid reversal of the dollar in the last two days has soured currency dealers.
 "We've completely wiped out any good will toward the dollar that might have built up with the rally," said Michael Faust, international portfolio manager at Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser in San Mateo, Calif.
 Support for the dollar has also been eroded by changing views of the Clinton Administration plan to impose punitive tariffs on imports of Japanese luxury cars.
 Traders had viewed the sanctions as good for the dollar on the ground that the United States would not have to rely on a weak dollar to pry open Japanese auto and auto parts markets.
 But strong European criticism of the United States decision has cast doubt on the effectiveness of the strategy, dealers and analysts said.

HEADLINE: Albany's Painful Budget Accord

 BODY:
It is not a pretty sight to watch Gov. George Pataki and New York State's Legislature stumble toward the finish line in their budget negotiations. Nearly two months late, they have reached agreement on the most punishing cuts in years in programs serving the poor, the sick, the elderly, the mentally disabled and the young. They have also resorted to fiscal gimmicks that are certain to create new budget problems next year. The best that can be said is that Republicans and Democrats have faced up to the difficult job of crawling out of a financial hole while mitigating some of the worst cutbacks demanded by Mr. Pataki.
The Governor's first budget was destined to be extremely tough. The state's economic decline has eroded the tax base, the cost of Medicaid is growing faster than anyone can find resources to pay for it, and the two parties stuffed last year's election-year budget with popular tax cuts and spending initiatives financed by revenue windfalls that did not recur. This year Mr. Pataki compounded his problem by insisting that he would deliver on his campaign pledge to enact even more tax cuts for which there was no money to pay. 
 In the end, Democrats and Republicans alike balked at the deep spending cuts Mr. Pataki wanted. They have sensibly restored money for the State University and City University to head off disturbingly steep tuition hikes and to minimize cuts in tuition assistance programs. They are allowing for a modest increase in aid to school districts, although it is too soon to tell how much will be available for New York City. They have saved home care for the elderly from elimination, and there will be no cuts in welfare benefit levels or time limits for those on welfare rolls.
But the agreed-upon cuts in mental health, child welfare and Medicaid, while less harsh than originally proposed, pose a severe threat to New York's tradition of caring for the most defenseless parts of the population. The budget imposes deep cuts on nursing homes, hospitals and agencies that care for the mentally ill and children in troubled or violent families. The Republican mantra in all these areas is that the cuts will force providers of medical and social services to curb waste and mismanagement. But the scale of the cuts looks as if it exceeds any waste. The state must be prepared to reverse course if serious suffering results.
Mr. Pataki has made good on his pledge to stop the growth of government spending in New York. But his achievement would have been more impressive if the budget had brought genuine structural balance to the state's finances. Instead, the ill-considered tax cut that is about to be passed will open up another budget hole growing to at least $3.6 billion in three years. In addition, this year's budget contains $1 billion in one-shot revenues that will disappear next year, deepening future deficits still further. It almost seems as if the Republicans want a deficit next year so they can propose still more welfare cuts before the elections, when the Democrats may have more trouble resisting them.
With the near-completion of the state budget, the painful fiscal drama for residents of New York City switches to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the City Council. The state budget leaves the city with the need to cut perhaps a half-billion dollars in spending beyond those reductions already announced. That will reduce services to the middle class and poor alike as the city struggles to emerge from its worst fiscal crisis in a generation.

HEADLINE: Research Repays Time and Costs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory recently announced the development of a superconducting tape capable of conducting a million amperes per square centimeter and yet supple enough to be wound into electrical cable. 
 What was lost in the excitement was the long, deliberate path that led to this moment and the long-term investment, or patient money, that supported it along the way -- from private industry, universities and the Federal Government, the three pillars that have traditionally supported basic research.
Today the Federal Government is looking to cut its science and technology budget (front page, May 22), and universities are facing declining research support. At the same time, American industry is cutting costs, with research and development shifting from fundamental science to applied engineering. Competition, Wall Street, survival -- the reasons are economic.
It was long, patient research that brought us the transistor, the silicon chip, wonder drugs and an electrical supply system we take for granted. Superconductive materials have been with us for more than 80 years, but it was only 10 years ago that we finally saw the potential of "high-temperature" superconductivity.
There is no sure way to know which of the many sciences now under investigation will raise the quality of life and help solve the environmental, economic and health concerns of tomorrow. Unfortunately, as both the public and private sectors, out of immediate financial pressure, turn inward, we eliminate possibilities.
It is imperative that we maintain our commitment to science and technology. One approach, which has served us well in the past and deserves more attention, is the coordinated pooling of funds and expertise among government, industry and universities. Such efficiency not only amplifies and accelerates payoffs, but also helps sustain the critical expertise needed to maintain the long-term health of this nation's economy and betterment of the human condition.

HEADLINE: Senate Committee Approves A Vast Overhaul of Welfare

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
The Senate Finance Committee approved a momentous shift in social policy today, voting to cancel the Federal guarantee of a subsistence income for poor children while giving states vast new power to design their own welfare programs without Federal standards.
By a vote of 12 to 8, the committee approved a sweeping welfare bill generally similar to one passed by the House in March. The committee chairman, Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, the bill's sponsor, said it would reach the Senate floor next month, and he predicted that more than 60 of the 100 senators would vote for it. 
 The White House, while criticizing many features of the bill, avoided any veto threat. Administration officials predicted that President Clinton would eventually sign a measure like the Senate bill, which would fulfill his campaign promise to "end welfare as we know it," though in ways far different from what he envisioned. Mr. Clinton never proposed ending the Federal guarantee of some minimal support for poor children, and his proposal would have spent more than would the Senate bill on programs to put welfare recipients to work.
Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said: "I am pleased that the legislation eliminates some of the extreme and punitive provisions in the bill passed by the House of Representatives. But it still has a long way to go on what should be the centerpiece of welfare reform -- helping people earn a paycheck, not a welfare check."
Today's vote followed party lines with one exception. Senator Max Baucus of Montana, a Democrat who is up for re-election next year and is considered vulnerable, voted for the bill. He said that it would be good for Montana and that he trusted state officials to take care of poor people in the absence of Federal standards.
The handling of welfare legislation illustrates how the Republican revolution that swept through the House in the first 100 days of the new Congress is moving at a more measured pace in the Senate. But the results are similar.
The Senate bill omits House provisions that would require states to deny cash assistance to unmarried teen-age mothers, most legal aliens and additional children born to families already receiving welfare. While it would not require those restrictions, however, it would allow the states to impose them.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat who has studied welfare policy for decades, described today's vote as "a constitutional moment" in which the committee was eliminating a safety net for dependent children that was established by the Social Security Act of 1935.
Democrats said state officials would sometimes be unable or unwilling to care for their poor. Senator Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois said the Federal Government had a duty to make sure children "will not go homeless or hungry, die from deprivation" or sleep on top of one another like street urchins.
But Republicans rejected that argument. Senator John H. Chafee, a moderate Republican from Rhode Island, said: "When I was Governor, one of the most sensitive issues I had before me was taking proper care of children. Governors are going to be extremely conscious of taking care of children. The fears of Senator Moseley-Braun are not justified."
The Department of Health and Human Services estimated that four million children would lose welfare benefits under a provision of the bill that would bar payments to any family for more than five years. The House bill also includes a five-year limit, and so that provision appears likely to become law.
The Senate bill, like the House bill, would eliminate any requirement for states to spend their own money as a condition of getting Federal money for cash assistance to poor people. States now contribute 43 percent of the money spent on the main welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children: $10 billion of $23 billion this year.
The Senate bill would also sharply restrict Supplemental Security Income benefits for disabled children. The cutbacks in the House bill are somewhat deeper.
Under Senator Packwood's bill, each state would receive a lump sum, or block grant, equal to the amount of Federal welfare spending in the state in 1994. The block grants would total $16.8 billion a year from 1996 through 2000, without any adjustment for inflation or population growth. States would have to put at least half of their adult welfare recipients into jobs, training or education programs by 2001, and their Federal welfare money could be cut 5 percent if they failed to do so.
John W. Tapogna, a welfare analyst at the Congressional Budget Office, told the committee that only six states could meet the work requirements; he did not name them. To comply with the requirements, he said, states would need to spend 60 percent of their block grants, $10 billion of the $16.8 billion, on job training, education and child care. Mr. Tapogna said that 44 states would accept financial penalties rather than invest so much of their Federal money in job programs.
As a result, said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, the work requirements in Mr. Packwood's bill are hollow. Deborah V. Weinstein of the Children's Defense Fund said the study by the Congressional Budget Office "shows that the work requirements are an exercise in posturing."
Mr. Packwood said he was surprised to hear that 44 states could not meet the work requirements, and he said he would re-examine this part of his bill.
Unlike the House measure, the Senate bill does not make any substantial change in food stamps or the school lunch program. But on the floor next month Republican senators may propose amendments to revamp those programs too.
Administration officials said this week that President Clinton would veto any bill that replaced food stamps with block grants. But the White House has not made such threats with respect to Aid to Families With Dependent Children.
An Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, "A.F.D.C. is the bone that the Clinton White House can throw to the hounds at the door, the people who want to make radical changes in the welfare state." The official said the White House had not made a major effort to preserve poor people's entitlement to welfare benefits because such an effort would have been "more trouble than it's worth" in political terms.
Senators from fast-growing states like Florida, Texas and Arizona expressed concern because Mr. Packwood's bill would freeze allocations of Federal money, with no allowance for changes in population. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, sent a letter to Mr. Packwood saying the proposed formula for dividing up Federal money "would produce devastating results over a five-year period."
The letter was signed by 29 other senators from Sun Belt states, many Republicans among them.

HEADLINE: Clothing Company Is Common Link in 3 Killings

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
One victim was an immigrant from Soviet Armenia shot to death two and a half years ago outside a prospering suburban sewing factory. Another garment industry executive, at his job less than a year, was slain in December while waiting at a stoplight in Los Angeles's inner city. Just three weeks ago, a longtime apparel industry executive was shot to death in his car.
 The only apparent link among these three killings is Carole Little, a Los Angeles-based women's apparel company that employed the two executives and contracted for sewing from the other victim. Investigators are trying to determine whether the slayings, as well as assaults on two other Carole Little associates, are connected. 
 "It's baffling," said Fred Miller, a Los Angeles Police Department detective.
 John P. Gill, an intelligence analyst for the Long Beach Police Department, said, "Nothing has been ruled out and there is no definitive connection."
 One theory suggested to explain the spate of violence is the rise of Russian organized crime, which law-enforcement officials say is taking root in the United States as the immigrant population swells; with the influx from what was once Soviet Armenia, the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale has in less than a decade seen Armenians become almost a majority of its population. Investigators are also exploring whether the attacks are an attempt to cover up financial irregularities.
 Another possible explanation comes from tensions between big manufacturers and the tiny contract shops that sew many of their garments. The relationship has been especially strained since the Clinton Administration began an aggressive crackdown on violations of labor law in garment centers like Los Angeles.
 Facing the threat that regulators will hold up their shipments, manufacturers like Carole Little have been trying to police their sewing-shop operators for what are suspected to be widespread violations of minimum wage and overtime rules. In Los Angeles, hundreds of family-controlled contracting shops cut fabric and sew clothing, operating on razor-thin profit margins with fewer than 50 employees, many of them recent immigrants.
 In response to Labor Department pressure, Carole Little has reduced its contracting network from 90 domestic shops to 30 since 1993 and has opened an internal compliance department to check payroll records of its contractors.
 "There were some strained relations with contractors who didn't feel we had the right to audit their records," said Leonard Rabinowitz, who co-founded the company in 1974 with his wife, Carole Little, a clothing designer. "That put us in a funny spot."
 But no other apparel producers, including Levi Strauss and Rampage Clothing, which are known in the industry for vigorously weeding out illegal contractors, have had the problems with violence that Carole Little has had, police and industry executives say. Indeed, industry executives are skeptical that Carole Little's move to consolidate its business among fewer contractors would lead to such deadly reprisals.
 "No one believes that," said Maurice B. Newman, president and chief executive of the California Mart, which houses 1,500 manufacturers. "Every manufacturer is very careful to make sure their contractors abide by the law. If you don't like it, you can put your production overseas."
 For his part, "I am bewildered," said Mr. Rabinowitz of Carole Little. The company has offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to any convictions.
 In December, Kenneth Martin, a Carole Little executive responsible for domestic and foreign contractors, was shot while at a stoplight. Then on May 4, Rolando Ramirez, the company's controller, who had been at Carole Little for 17 years, was killed. He was responsible for the company's finances, including making payments to sewing contractors, fabric finishers and textile suppliers. An internal audit that had already been planned is being speeded up as part of the police inquiry.
 "Embezzlement is one hypothesis being investigated," Mr. Rabinowitz said. But so far, investigators have not found any financial irregularities and have not made a connection between Mr. Ramirez's death and his business, Mr. Rabinowitz said.
 "Any objective person would have to wonder if there wasn't a connection," said Ellen J. Aragon, a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney. She is prosecuting Karapet N. Demirdzhyan, 35, of Los Angeles, on first-degree murder charges in the November 1993 killing of Hakop Antonyan, the Carole Little sewing contractor.
 Mr. Demirdzhyan entered a not guilty plea last August. At that hearing, a Glendale police detective testified that Carole Little had made cutbacks among some of its sewing contractors and that as a result Mr. Antonyan's business had surged.
 Prosecutors did not discuss what they thought was Mr. Demirdzhyan's motive, said his lawyer, James Sussman of Pasadena. "The whole focus has changed because of the subsequent killings," he said, declining to comment further.
 Garnik Antonyan, 47, is certain there is a link between his brother's slaying and Gaha Inc., the sewing business he and his brother started in 1987. "My brother didn't have personal enemies," Mr. Antonyan said. "Whatever happened to my brother is business related. That's 100 percent certain, but why and how I don't know."
 One week after the anniversary of his brother's death, Garnik Antonyan and his wife, Diana, 45, were wounded in an attack outside Gaha. The gunman fled when Mr. Antonyan returned fire with a weapon he began carrying after his brother was killed.
 Karin Wong-Holzinger, a former Carole Little employee responsible for trimming the company's contractor network, survived two bombing attempts at her Long Beach home and a freeway shooting in Compton, Calif., in 1993. She said she had taken a leave of absence to recuperate and was dismissed while on leave; Mr. Rabinowitz says the dismissal was tied to her job performance. She contends in a wrongful-termination suit that she was attacked as a result of the company's efforts to sever ties with some sewing contractors. The company denies any wrongdoing in her dismissal.
 During the California recession, the garment industry has been one of the growth sectors in Los Angeles and now supports nearly 110,000 jobs, making it the region's No. 2 manufacturing employer, after the high-technology and aerospace industry. Carole Little, a private company that had revenue of $375 million last year, is probably the third-largest apparel maker in the region, after Bugle Boy and Guess Inc., said Jack Kyser, president of the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation, a private association that tries to help create jobs.
 Carole Little's reputation as a maker of career clothes at affordable prices has earned it prominent floor space at its largest customers -- Dillard Department Stores, R. H. Macy and May Department Stores.
 The company has benefited from the economic beating taken by big department stores as apparel sales have fallen. In an effort to increase efficiency, retailers have curbed the number of manufacturers they buy from. Carole Little's sales were only $204 million in 1992, slightly more than half last year's level.

HEADLINE: Club Med Comes of Age

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO; JOSEPH SIANO is assistant to the editor of the Travel section.

 BODY:
CLUB MED, which once advertised that it had an antidote for civilization, is now trying to provide a cocktail mixer for it. The resort chain turned 45 this year, and is watching many of its regular customers reach their 50's and 60's, which explains why one of its newest outposts, Columbus Isle on San Salvador, doesn't seem to belong in a Club originally founded on communal dining tables and guest rooms with no door locks. Age has turned Club Med soft.
In the interest of added comfort and service, Columbus Isle -- which opened in December 1992 on the island that is believed to have been Columbus's first landfall in North America -- has all the civilized appurtenances that the Club once spurned: Its rooms are equipped with locks, safes, cable television and civilization's rudest intruder of all, a telephone with a message light. 
 But as my wife, Marsha, and I found out on a five-day visit in February, the technology turned out to be unobtrusive. The songbirds' wake-up calls sufficed; the flowers, palms and the sea beyond -- a view that filled one full wall of our room -- far outdid the cable TV.
With some of the highest rates of any Club Med village (in high season $210 a person a night, double occupancy, including all meals and most activities), Columbus Isle has to do more than provide the Club basics -- and it does, starting with a staff that one of my fellow guests described semi-incredulously as "happy and peppy and bursting with love" -- even without tips.
I could appreciate the difficulty of the task. As a long-ago veteran of two traditional Club Meds, I spent the weeks before our trip trying to prepare my wife, explaining why she would enjoy eating every meal at a table with six strangers, and staying in an unlocked room. I wasn't making much headway.
We arrived on Sunday via the Miami-Nassau-San Salvador connection (a pair of one-hour flights) on Bahamasair. Minutes after the 50-passenger turboprop had touched down on the airstrip carved out of the island's rocky terrain, a Club Med van deposited us at the lobby entrance, where the standard gantlet of smiling, clapping staff members awaited us and the 20 other guests on our flight.
I was smiling, too; then again, I hadn't yet learned that the half-mile, three-minute ride from airport to resort cost $10 a person round trip, making New York cab fares seem low.
If there were added costs along the way (as we were to find out often during our stay), there were also added courtesies. Sophie, one of the resort staff, personally walked us to our room, stopping to point out the high spots on a mural depicting the resort "village" that would be our home for the next five days. We also passed the small booth where we could get fresh beach towels the moment the ones we were using became even slightly damp.
Our room, which was on the ground floor of one of the two-story four-unit guest cottages, was at least twice as big as the accommodations at the Clubs I had visited, and was devoid of the dormitory feel I remembered. The walk-in closet had ample shelf space, and the roomy, brightly illuminated bathroom had a stall shower, makeup table and chair, hair dryer and mini-refrigerator. Furnishings included a queen-size bed, a daybed with a reading lamp, a wooden writing table and a padded chair and ottoman made out of a plastic rattan. The white ceramic-tile floors and walls gave the room a bright, spacious, airy feel. The room was spotless, though we did find a large but harmless bug in our room the last night.
On one wall was a feathered mask from an Amazon tribe; on the other, framed propeller-shaped pages from a Burmese bible. Six floor-to-ceiling wooden panels folded back to expose a large sliding glass door that led onto a small porch facing the sea, which was visible beyond a lawn studded with short palms. Outside, flowering plants surrounded walkways and climbed trellises.
Statues, carvings and folk art from around the world adorned the public spaces and rooms, as if a treasure hunter had shipwrecked here and decided to settle in and decorate. The pieces were, in fact, collected from more than 35 countries by Gisela Trigano, whose husband, Serge, is Club Med's chairman. As I walked through ornately carved wooden doorways from Indian palaces or sat beside a happily grinning buddha, I never saw any markers indicating the origin of these pieces; as a result, their impact was emotional rather than intellectual.
THE first night of our stay, our small group got the orientation talk, a combination pep rally and staff introduction that soft-pedaled the pep. When Chris, the head of the sports staff, covered the weekly picnic cruise, for example, he noted that this wasn't "like some of the other Club Med picnics you may have heard about." He assured us that there wouldn't be the traditional bathing-suit swap. Our fellow guests, most of whom were 40 and older, did not look disappointed.
Columbus Isle's tone was definitely modulated. I realized it was unlikely I would hear Chris announce over the public address system, as his counterpart at another Club did 10 years ago, that the village nurse was sunbathing topless beside the pool. Although the Club has the requisite discotheque, the late-night social scene was centered more around the Club's indoor bar and an adjacent large parlor filled with cushy sofas. A live band played selections worthy of VH-1 rather than MTV, and staff members staged small, informal skits (most of which involved cross-dressing, with mixed results).
The nightly stage shows were presented in an open-air amphitheater where the only unpleasantness was the odor of bug spray that came wafting in each evening around sunset (guests may still need their own insect repellent). The shows themselves were like most at Club Med, amicably amateurish with some professional touches. I might have been a harsher critic if the performers weren't staff members who had already worked a full day.
Besides, if you want to criticize, the Club obliges with a few targets. Like a can of Budweiser for $4.80, or sunscreen for $11. If the latter could be excused as the price for arriving unprepared, this cannot: The least costly alternative to the processed tap water, unpalatable even after being filtered and chilled, was a 1.5-liter bottle of water for $2.40. The Club includes unlimited wine and beer with meals, so why not tasty water?
We hadn't made reservations in either of the village's two specialty restaurants the first night, so we ate in the main dining room. It was buffet style, and the meats, fish, salads, cheeses and breads were fresh and varied. The high-ceilinged room was warmly lighted, and the noise never became intrusive -- perhaps because the village, which can accommodate up to 522 guests, had only about 240 that week. We had our choice of the regular eight-seat group tables or more intimate tables just for the two of us. (The specialty restaurants emphasize the latter.)
Every meal offered a few well-prepared entrees, and only once did we see any fruits or salads that had lost the blush of youth. But the low-fat selections were unimaginative -- plain poultry or fish -- and the items that usually suffer the worst in buffets (grilled meat and fish) fared no better here.
On our third night, we tried the Italian restaurant, Dona Isabel. Large bouquets of rice-paper flowers, found throughout the village, added touches of color to the softly lighted second-floor room. Although the food was served buffet style, as in the main dining room, it was a step up in style, with a slightly dressier dress code -- no shorts or tank tops.
A rich, peppery minestrone and delicious marinated eggplant were memorable starters; the prosciutto was too salty, though, and mussels were served lukewarm. The veal dishes, pizza hot out of the oven and fresh breadsticks were successes. One caloric warning: There were no limits on the tiramisu.
The next night brought our favorite dinner. The Club's grill restaurant, Media Luna, offers regular menu service with the accent on steaks and fish. My wife's grilled salmon was in that ideal state of balance between doneness and tenderness, swimming in a translucent butter sauce. My New York strip steak (exactly medium well) had met its match in a shimmering bearnaise.
In the spirit of Christopher Columbus, who is said to have arrived a few miles up the beach, we decided not to limit our horizons to the Club grounds. So on our first morning there, for $25 apiece, we took the half-day island sightseeing tour.
Our driver and guide was the Rev. Livingston Williams, a Zion Baptist minister who has spent most of his life on the island. Mr. Williams was a great advertisement for island living; he said he was 76 years old, but looked closer to 60.
About 750 people now live on San Salvador, he said as we navigated the island's paved and not-so-paved main road. Mr. Williams tends both crops and his flock; he pointed out his small farm and showed us the new church he is building (the minister's price wasn't all-inclusive; he politely solicited a donation to the building fund).
The island, 13 miles long and 5 miles wide, is not a stunner geographically -- with low scrub covering rocky terrain, and lakes in the middle; one of Columbus's supposed landing sites is at Long Bay, marked by a tall white crucifix and a few other monuments. It is scuba diving that provides the essential sightseeing experience at Columbus Isle; San Salvador is surrounded by coral reefs, and the resort has three custom-built dive boats capable of carrying 50 divers each.
By the end of the club's two-afternoon course ($25, including equipment), I had plumbed the deepest regions of the Club's pool, boldly leaped off the end of the boat pier and felt comfortable exploring one of the dive sites the next afternoon.
MEANWHILE, Marsha happily worked out in the village's exercise room. Classes in stretching, step aerobics and in-pool exercises were also provided for no extra charge. Columbus Isle also indulged her love of beaches, with a two-mile-long stretch of sand washed by a mild surf and amply supplied with simple lounge chairs and umbrellas -- and with plenty of fine white sand between each guest, there was never a claustrophobic feeling. To protect the delicate-looking dune vegetation bordering the beach, access from the village is via elevated footbridges.
One challenge remained, and I -- along with four other novice divers and a staff expert as our guide -- would face it on my final afternoon at the Club. I signed up for a dive to one of the coral walls not far off the beach ($35, including equipment), and as the boat approached the dive site, I could tell I was heading into a different depth. The water's color changed from a benign turquoise to an ominous deep violet, marking the sudden drop in the ocean floor at the coral wall.
Don, the staff member who was guiding us, used a series of hand signals to point out the rays and other sea life swimming by. We never did meet the friendly grouper that has a penchant for swimming right up to divers and nibbling on their hair, but the multihued fish and the spidery coral had me enraptured.
About 20 minutes into our dive, the spell broke. It turned out I was a regular bubble machine, probably because I was concentrating too hard on breathing. And with my tank low on air, I started floating inexorably to the surface, regretfully watching the fish and coral fade into the distance. "When you go out tomorrow," Don told me later, "just don't breathe so much."
Don's advice came too late for me; we would be leaving the next afternoon. In a resort with unlimited beer, wine, tiramisu, sunshine and visual delights, it was just my luck to find the one place where the air was rationed.

The Resort
 Although Columbus Isle is not a couples-only resort, singles are much more likely to have a good time if they are avid scuba divers or accomplished snorkelers. And there is little to entertain young children.
Columbus Isle is as dressed-down most of the time as other Club Med villages, but T-shirts, sneakers, tank tops and jeans or shorts are out of place in the evening in the Club's two specialty restaurants.
For reservations, call (800) 258-2633.
 
Getting There
For those not taking the Club Med charter flights, Bahamasair operates flights Wednesday through Sunday to San Salvador from Nassau on 50-passenger turboprops. From Miami, the five-day advance-purchase fare is $254.95 round trip; the unrestricted fare is $300.95. For $376 round trip to San Salvador, Delta offers service to Nassau from La Guardia on Fridays, with a connection on Bahamasair to San Salvador; the return flights are on Mondays only. A Club Med van provides round-trip service to and from the airport for $10 (the trip is free for those on the Club Med charter flights).
 
Rates
From April 29 to Dec. 9 (low season), weekly rates are $1,050 a person and daily rates $150 a person (ages 12 and up), based on double occupancy and without transportation. Weekly rates including round-trip air fare from Miami are $1,420; from New York, $1,650 (a special rate of $1,470 from New York is being offered from June 24 to Sept. 2). Add 30 percent to the weekly rate for single occupancy of a standard room.
"Economy singles" rooms with shared baths (for a 30 percent discount off standard rates) have the amenities of the regular rooms, but are only about a third the size. Some overlook the well-tended lawns and flowers behind the main guest cottages, but others face the rather sparse vegetation behind the village. None have ocean views or picture windows.
Club Med also charges all guests an initiation fee of $30 a family and annual membership fees of $50 a person, $20 for those under 12. Certain Clubs, such as this one, are geared to couples and singles (material for Columbus Isle says that children from age 12 are welcome). In such cases, families with children under the suggested age must sign a waiver informing them that there are no facilities for children and that parents are responsible for them.
 
What's Included
All meals; beer and table wine at meals; instruction and use of equipment for windsurfing, sailing, kayaking, waterskiing, snorkeling (including boat trips to coral reefs), tennis (10 Har-Tru courts, 3 lighted), bicycling, volleyball, basketball, boccie and aerobics and exercise classes. The smallish exercise room has one stationary bike, two programmable stair machines and treadmills, dumbbells, a circuit weight machine and aerobic steps. There is a weekly picnic cruise to a secluded beach.
 
What's Not
Scuba diving: $100 for a six-day package that includes all equipment (you pay even if you bring your own), two dives a day, one night dive and a fruit plate after each dive. For beginners, the program includes one day of lessons and five daytime dives. Per-day programs are $25. Advanced certification courses, $195.
Bar drinks: cappuccino ($1.60), Coke ($2), Perrier ($3.20), mixed-drink specials ($4), most beers ($4.80 a can) and hard liquor ($3.20 to $5.80). Fancier dinner wines cost $20 to $60 a bottle. Soft-drink machines dispense sodas for $1.
Sightseeing: Sunset cruise, $10; half-day island van tour, $25; three-hour deep-sea fishing, $160; day trip to Nassau, $280.
The spa: from $25 for a manicure to $65 for a major-overhaul facial.

ART LESSONS
Learning From the Rise and Fall
of Public Arts Funding.
By Alice Goldfarb Marquis.
304 pp. New York: Basic Books. $25. 
WHENEVER Flannery O'Connor was asked whether universities stifled creative writers, she used to say, "They don't stifle enough of them." Given the pious tone of most contemporary discourse about the arts, such crankiness is downright refreshing. Fortunately, there is plenty of it in Alice Goldfarb Marquis's "Art Lessons: Learning From the Rise and Fall of Public Arts Funding."
Ms. Marquis, a visiting scholar in history at the University of California, San Diego, and the author of "Alfred H. Barr Jr.: Missionary for the Modern," has written a lively, detailed history of public arts funding that doesn't shy away from either the hard facts or most of the hard questions.
Consider her discussion of the current battle to cut or abolish the National Endowment for the Arts. While critics worry that such measures might reduce the number of artists in America, Ms. Marquis reminds us that artists are not exactly an endangered species. "Between 1965 and 1984," she writes, "the number of professional arts organizations had grown by 700 percent." And from a base year of 1986, she projects that by the year 2000 "total civilian employment is expected to grow by 19 percent, while the number of artists will swell by 31 percent."
Ms. Marquis also dares to suggest that quantity drives out quality: "Art is not a product like soybeans, but rather the outcome of imaginative endeavor by talented people, of whom there is always a limited supply. When grants prop up artists unable to attract audiences, individuals with limited abilities persist, crowding out superior talents."
Equally refreshing is Ms. Marquis's matter-of-fact approach to the "politicization" of the endowment. About Congressional reauthorization of the N.E.A. (which now occurs every two years), she writes, "The agency must, like a Siberian sled dashing through a pack of ravening wolves, liberally toss out chunks of goodies that key committee members can carry home to their districts." This fund-renewal process has always served to politicize the arts agency.
The distribution of such goodies, combined with the prestige that politicians gain when they associate themselves with the arts, explains why, for the first 20 years of the endowment, it was good politics for both Republicans and Democrats to support it. Only in the 1980's did such support become bad politics. The question is: Why?
To her credit, Ms. Marquis does not simply blame the Republicans -- indeed, she recalls that money for the arts continued to rise steeply under President Richard M. Nixon. Rather, she observes that during the Reagan years "a self-styled avant-garde" began "thrusting itself into media attention with strident political and sexual 'art.' "
"No expression, no matter how tasteless, depraved or insulting, could get the slightest rise out of art patrons," Ms. Marquis notes. But these strident gestures did get a rise out of Congress. Before you could say Mapplethorpe, she writes, "500 rampant bourgeois politicians with access to 500 microphones rewarded the new provocateurs with a thundering outrage not seen in the artistic world for many a decade."
Was this blowup inevitable? Would it have happened without public arts funding? On these thorny matters, Ms. Marquis is somewhat less clear. She chides every chief of the endowment from Nancy Hanks to Jane Alexander for failing to exercise artistic leadership. Yet she also asserts repeatedly that such leadership has no place in a democracy, and that the will of the people is better expressed in the marketplace.
About the marketplace, however, Ms. Marquis is ambivalent. On the one hand, she mocks the tendency of arts organizations to prefer hemorrhaging money to besmirching themselves with profit. On the other, she derides the way fund-raisers for the arts praise theaters and museums in the language of economic boosterism. This ambivalence extends to the private sector. Taking her cue from the historian Lawrence W. Levine, Ms. Marquis dismisses the great 19th-century philanthropists as philistine social climbers intent upon "sacralizing" art. Yet she admires John D. Rockefeller 3d and Dorothy Chandler, "neither of them passionate or at all knowledgeable about culture," for having dedicated their lives and fortunes to "developing homes for the performing arts."
Unfortunately, this ambivalence comes to a head in Ms. Marquis's proposed solution. For every locality, she would appoint a "public impresario" who would use government money to facilitate unlimited public access to unlimited arts activities. This is a bizarre proposal: First, it takes as its model the colorful impresarios of the last century, who were nothing if not creatures of the marketplace. And second, it sidesteps the likelihood that these public impresarios would be gatekeepers of the worst sort.
The ultimate questions are philosophical: Is artistic excellence possible in a democratic society? And if so, how is it to be sustained? By challenging the stale orthodoxies of both sides in the current debate, this fair-minded, bracingly irreverent book moves us closer to the answers. But by glossing over the real tensions between democratic taste and inherited standards of excellence, it leaves the hardest lessons unlearned.

HEADLINE: Spies & Thrillers

BYLINE: By Newgate Callendar 

 BODY:
THE LAST HIGH GROUND, by Robin A. White (Crown, $23), features Shig Onishi, a smart, determined accountant who works for the Economic Crimes Section of the National Police Agency in Tokyo. Compare him with Brian J. MacHenry, an equally smart and determined American investigator and former airline pilot. Each of them is trying to discover why new Boeing planes, the pride of the fleet, are going down.
The American and the Japanese get together to pool their findings. They have different mind-sets, and the result is a cultural clash. What is obvious to one is not so obvious to the other. "Shig felt like reaching over and shaking this thickheaded gaijin," Mr. White writes. "MacHenry was slow! . . . Maybe MacHenry wasn't so smart." But as Shig pursues his line of thought, the American has his own doubts: "MacHenry wondered how good an investigator Onishi was." 
 Of course, they finally come to a meeting of the minds as they collaborate on a case that puts both of them in peril. It centers on a Japanese Mafioso who wants to purchase Boeing. If Boeing aircraft continue to tumble out of the skies, the great American corporation can be picked up for peanuts.
And there is more to it than that. The United States is in bad economic shape, with a restless citizenry and a feeling of revolution in the air. The loss of Boeing would be disastrous to the balance of trade. Yet there are politicians in Washington who would sacrifice their country for personal gain.
MacHenry and Onishi have to cope with a variety of crises. There is a computer virus to be overcome. There is an enigmatic woman who is as lethal as any of the yakuza. There are powerful Beltway figures who can command immense resources as they set out to destroy anybody who threatens them.
It is a heady brew that Mr. White, the author of "Angle of Attack" and "The Sword of Orion," has concocted. If the battle at the end is a bit too contrived, no matter. "The Last High Ground" soars.
John Lawton's BLACK OUT (Viking, $22.95) is a fine first novel. The setting is London during the blitz of 1944. Detective Sgt. Frederick Troy is investigating a series of murders. The son of an aristocrat, Troy is an unusual type -- literate, sophisticated and highly intuitive.
With very little to go on, he eventually realizes that all of the victims were foreign scientists working for the Allied war effort. Trying to get more information, he has to deal with the Americans, specifically with a new, mysterious group known as the O.S.S.
Mr. Lawton, who produces television documentaries in Britain, is an elegant writer. His plotting is logical, and his backgrounds are haunting. Anybody who was in England during the blitz (as this reviewer was) will testify to the accuracy of the author's descriptions: the stoicism and heroism of the people, the Hyde Park orators spouting the Communist Party line, the ersatz food, the chippies in Piccadilly -- all of it is here.
In NIGHT OF THE APOCALYPSE (Harper Collins, $24), Daniel Easterman is concerned with Irish terrorism. The protagonist, Declan Carberry, heads the Irish Republic's Special Detective Unit, which handles counterterrorism. He is given a delicate assignment. Muslim leaders are meeting in Dublin, and Carberry is put in charge of security. Things go wrong, and he is made the scapegoat.
Terrorists capture Muslim delegates, make crazy demands and start killing off hostages when their demands are not met. They seem to be religious lunatics of some kind. Carberry finds himself working with a notorious Muslim terrorist, who has come to Ireland to get several of his friends out of the hands of their captors.
The book is full of wild action, with a terrific shoot-out. Mr. Easterman, whose previous novels include "Brotherhood of the Tomb," "Name of the Beast" and "The Judas Testament," even manages to find space for a romance amid all the gore.
The world of pumping iron is examined in Richard La Plante's STEROID BLUES (Forge/Tom Doherty, $22.95). This is a psychothriller, dominated by two freaks of enormous strength who can literally tear a man apart. What with all that, plus kinky sex, skinheads and the underbelly of Philadelphia, Capt. Bill Fogarty has his hands full. Mr. La Plante, the author of "Mantis" and "Leopard," tells the story skillfully, creating tension and a mounting feeling of horror as he peers into some very sick minds.

HEADLINE: A CITY SCHOOL EXPERIMENT THAT ACTUALLY WORKS

BYLINE: By Sara Mosle; Sara Mosle is a staff writer at The New Yorker and runs an after-school program at P.S. 128.

 BODY:
JOSEPH NEWKIRK LOOKED LIKE SPIDERMAN. HE WAS clinging to the cyclone fence surrounding the playground at Intermediate School 70 on West 17th Street in Manhattan. His tie whipped his face in the breeze. Far below, his students egged on their superhero: "You can do it, Mr. Newkirk!" and "You've almost got it now-w-w-w!" The string he was clutching made it look as if he were actually spinning a web. It rose to the top of the fence, slipped down through the bare branches of the tree, dipped and ascended again, and finally halted where the kite had become ensnared in the fire escape of an adjoining building.
Newkirk pulled; the kite wagged its tail. "Oooh! Careful!" cried several kids below. The students had built the kite in Newkirk's middle-school science class at the School for the Physical City, a new public school in its second year in Manhattan, and they didn't want to see their latest test model destroyed. Across the playground, kites of all shapes and sizes floated like clouds above the cement plain. Below, clumps of students shadowed their movements and recorded data on clipboards. 
 The students, most of them barely teen-agers, wore the standard uniforms of stylish urban grunge -- baggy jeans, T-shirts, flannel work shirts, baseball caps, boots, sneakers. Their parents had chosen to send them to S.P.C., as it's called, instead of their regular neighborhood schools, as part of a foundling citywide "choice" program initiated by Joseph A. Fernandez in 1992, when he was School Chancellor. The students, from mostly lower- and middle-income families, come from all over the city. Although there are slightly more boys than girls, the kids otherwise represent an ideal cross-section of the city's student population. By ideal, I mean more integrated: African-Americans, Latinos and whites each constitute somewhat less than a third; the remaining 15 percent or so are Asian. The students could have walked straight out of one of those multicultural Benetton ads.
Newkirk's students were conducting an experiment, and they are part of one too. The School for the Physical City is just one of 50 new public schools that have opened in New York City in the last two years. Fernandez pushed for their creation before being ousted in 1993. They are organized around a variety of themes and pedagogical philosophies. Their unwieldy names announce their missions: the High School for Health Professions and Human Services, El Puente Academy for Peace and Justice, the Kingsborough Academy of Sciences High School. Each of them, though, might be called the Smaller School of Smaller Classes, for that is their chief, shared, revolutionary idea.
Although all of the schools fall under the auspices of the city's central Board of Education, most of these new schools have been given crucial support from several local nonprofit groups that last year received the first "Annenberg grants." These much-coveted awards come from the philanthropist Walter K. Annenberg, who pledged $500 million in December 1993 to help reform public school systems nationwide. Over the next five years, New York City will receive some $50 million, to be matched 2 to 1 by both public and private dollars. (Already $8.5 million has been raised from three organizations -- Time Warner, the Aaron Diamond Foundation and the Charles Hayden Foundation.) Among educators, Annenberg's name is constantly being invoked, as in "When Annenberg comes. . ." and "When Annenberg gets here. . ." and "Now that Annenberg is here." You'd think Godot had finally arrived.
Annenberg's money has provided a desperately needed infusion of hope into the city's beleaguered public school system. But as great as his gift may seem, it's dwarfed by the city's annual $8 billion education budget and doesn't begin to make up for recent cutbacks. Because of the ongoing fiscal crisis in New York, some $540 million has been cut from the city's schools in the last year alone, and an additional $750 million may be slashed even before classes begin in the fall -- more than $1 billion total. All of this comes at a time of steeply rising enrollments. A new demographic bulge, the baby boomers' children, has just entered grade school.
In New York, this influx has been compounded by a huge increase in immigration. In New York City, for instance, the total number of students in the last two years has topped one million. And the number is expected to rise by some 20,000 students annually well into the 21st century. Overcrowding is rampant, with classes held in hallways, cafeterias, auditoriums, closets and even some lavatories. School facilities, most of them built before the Depression, are falling apart. But because of the city's budget crunch, a capital improvement campaign has essentially been abandoned. Some of the city's neighborhood high schools resemble anonymous factories, with upward of 4,000 students each. Production, one might say, is at a standstill: only half of the city's entering freshmen typically graduate in four years.
Can smaller schools and smaller classes really transform a school system beset by so many other problems? And if they can, are we willing to pay for them? The story of the School for the Physical City is instructive of some of the difficulties inherent in what might be called, for lack of a better term, "school-raising." S.P.C. has already been subject to as many influences -- fiscal, parental, political, pedagogical and philanthropic -- as the most impressionable adolescent; and, like many new schools, it may be neglected or even abandoned before it's full grown. The story is a little like "Bringing Up Baby," the 30's comedy about raising a leopard, and the plot twists are as frequent. To the extent that all successful schools resemble one another, it's also the story of a school-reform movement.
MARK WEISS'S TYPICAL school day begins when his digital alarm goes off at 4:48 A.M. Weiss, the principal of S.P.C., gets up and takes his dog for a walk outside his home in Peekskill, N.Y., about an hour's drive north of Manhattan. By 5:25 A.M. he's in his car barreling south on the Henry Hudson Parkway toward S.P.C. in the dark.
At 49, Mark looks a little like Santa Claus in civvies. He has white hair, a white beard, pink cheeks and twinkly eyes. He isn't fat like Santa, but is just as jolly, even so early in the morning. For the previous 24 hours, I'd been shadowing my subject and was feeling a little bleary-eyed. We left the school around 6 the night before and arrived at Weiss's home just before 7:30. He didn't get out of the car. His wife and daughter got in. Together we drove to his daughter's open-school night at her suburban public high school -- a sprawling state-of-the-art facility that lighted up the night sky like Cape Canaveral before a midnight launch. The art rooms alone consist of a drafting area, a pottery studio with full-size kiln, a photo lab and darkroom, and a space set up with easels for painting or drawing.
Mark seemed untroubled by the inequities between his daughter's school and his own. Like a former star quarterback in the sky box, he offered a running commentary on the parent-teacher play-by-play. By 9:30, the family was back home, and by 10 Weiss and his wife were in bed. This was a late night. From the guest room I could hear his daughter tiptoeing around. In a touching reversal of roles, she was trying not to wake her slumbering parents.
Mark, as even his students call him, likes getting to the office early to enjoy a moment of peace and quiet, to make a few phone calls and to get a pot of coffee going for his teachers. They start to stream in around 7 A.M. The School for the Physical City doesn't actually have a physical school in the city -- at least not yet. Like most of the new schools, it consists of a few fugitive classrooms inside the leviathan brick hull of I.S. 70 in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. Although S.P.C. will move into a newly renovated building in the fall, it is almost the sole exception among the new schools in having acquired permanent housing.
Finding S.P.C.'s quarters inside the larger building isn't easy. You don't walk "into" the school: its classrooms are scattered across two floors. Mark's office isn't really an office, but a large classroom that also serves as a teachers' lounge, conference room, nurse's office, storage closet, Xerox room, reception area and general place to hang out -- a kind of TV room without the TV. Kids camp out on the large sofa installed against one wall. They gossip with each other, do their homework, give passing teachers a hard time, chew on their hair. The teachers, for their part, give as good as they get. They sit around a large table that stands at the room's center both literally and metaphorically, where the entire staff gathers to discuss everything from that day's field trip to the direction of the school. If the school can be said to exist in any one place at all it's in this classroom up on the second floor.
IN APRIL 1992 MARK WEISS WAS having lunch with his old friend Sam Schwartz at a Thai restaurant on Ninth Avenue when they came up with the idea for S.P.C.. The two first met at the Nixon Impeachment Coalition in Brooklyn in 1972. "If it weren't for Richard Nixon, this school wouldn't exist today," Schwartz likes to say. Schwartz is perhaps best known to the public as "Gridlock Sam" -- he coined the term "gridlock" when he was the city's traffic commissioner in the 80's. He's now the director of the Infrastructure Institute at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York. As he recalled, "I was bemoaning how most of the city's infrastructure professionals" -- urban planners, tunnel inspectors, civil engineers -- "didn't come from New York City, much less the city's public schools, and I wanted to find a way to interest city kids in their own environment." Mark, not surprisingly, thought of starting a school.
At the time, Weiss was director of instruction and professional development at the Office of Alternative High Schools at the Board of Education. He grew up in Flatbush, attended the neighborhood public schools and went to Brooklyn College in the mid-1960's. He was a student radical. (He met his future wife at an antiwar meeting and still refers, only half-jokingly, to "the revolution.") He began his career in 1967 by returning to teach at his alma mater, Brooklyn Technical High School, and has worked ever since in the city's public schools -- as a teacher, a principal, a union delegate, and even a Board of Education bureaucrat.
From 1979 to 1991, Weiss was the founding principal of Bronx Regional, a small, successful "alternative" high school in the South Bronx for kids who weren't succeeding, for one reason or another, in the city's regular public schools. As Mark later put it: "Sam didn't understand that people like us could start a public school. He thought it was something that only the Board of Ed could do." As the two friends talked, they began to imagine a junior-high and high school that would use the city as an extended classroom for hands-on projects that might motivate kids and become a springboard for introducing more traditional subjects in science, math, history and language arts.
Weiss knew that if they wanted to create a really good school, they'd have to find outside money. Nowhere, perhaps, are public schools more complicated than in how they are financed. They're cobbled together by various scraps of Federal, state, city and philanthropic funds, most of which come with strings attached. Many schools have what's known as "grant writing" committees that send out mass mailings, which resemble direct-mail campaigns, to raise money. Once pieced together, however, these unrelated programs often don't make any sense, which is one reason why the design of so many public schools -- dictated by necessity rather than reason -- is so peculiar.
Schwartz approached the New York City Mission Society, the city's oldest charitable organization, which agreed to devise the school's parental-outreach programs. He also teamed up with John Jay Iselin, president of Cooper Union. In many ways, Cooper was the ideal partner. The college was established in 1859 by the industrialist and inventor Peter Cooper to provide educational opportunities for the city's working poor. Today Cooper Union is the only private, tuition-free college of its caliber in the country. It operates on a shoestring and is everything that Weiss and Schwartz hoped their own school would be: rigorous, diverse and, most important, free.
Together, Weiss and his partners applied for and received a "planning grant" from the Fund for New York City Public Education to establish one of its 16 "New Vision" Schools. Founded in 1989, the fund is one of the groups receiving the Annenberg money. It functions a little like a Ouija board -- channeling the disparate and mysterious forces of the Board of Ed, the United Federation of Teachers, community organizations, individual educators, foundations and philanthropists into sensible and clearly articulated reforms. "You need an independent group to mediate, to push things, to negotiate hard, to provide some accountability," explained Naomi Barber, the fund's New Visions project director. "People talk to us because we don't have a political stake in being aligned with any particular group. And we bring the private sector to the table."
In July 1992 Weiss went on a weeklong rafting trip on the Green River in Colorado. The trip was hosted by the Harvard Outward Bound Project to bring educational leaders together to discuss school reform. One of the participants was Meg Campbell, co-director of Outward Bound's expeditionary learning center at Harvard's graduate school of education. The first night there was a torrential downpour. They huddled under their tarps on the banks of the Green River. Out of the dark a National Park Ranger emerged with a message: Outward Bound had won a grant from the New American Schools Development Corporation to create several "expeditionary learning centers" throughout the United States.
Over campfires, the group discussed its plans. "An Outward Bound course is a very accelerated method of finding out a great deal about a person," Campbell recalled. "You find out if they're really workers, or if they just paddle a little bit on top of the water. It told me a lot about Mark's backbone, his patience and tenacity and his remarkable gift of humor." Partly because of what Campbell learned, Outward Bound picked the School for the Physical City as one of its first expeditionary learning centers.
The educators eventually rafted 45 miles down Disaster Falls, Hell's Half Mile and Triplet Falls. But for Weiss, starting his new school was to be the real River Wild. Its name alone gives one pause. The school's letterhead now reads:
School for the Physical City, An Expeditionary Learning Center, a New Visions/New American Schools Development Corporation Partnership with the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, the Infrastructure Institute at Cooper Union, the New York City Mission Society, New York City Outward Bound, Outward Bound USA, a collaboration of Community School District 2 and the Division of High Schools' Office of Alternative High Schools and Programs.
A public school is the educational equivalent of Grand Central Terminal: all of these lines intersect in the physical place called "school." That Weiss has been able to keep all of the competing interests from colliding and on track is a testament to his fund-raising abilities, his general political savviness and his considerable powers of persuasion. But this elongated title also suggests the difficulty in duplicating S.P.C.'s potential success, which at least partly depends on coming up with the kind of private resources that Weiss, with his unique talents, has been able to marshal. And even he can't do it all. As Campbell noted: "The tug is between outside demands on Mark's time, in terms of fund-raising and resource mobilization -- just being married to all those different partners, all of whom want him to come to their board meetings and their galas -- balanced against the knowledge that the school is really about teaching and learning and the students' work."
TWO DAYS BEFORE CLASSES were to begin last fall, Weiss was still having to scare up some furniture and other basic supplies. His nine-person teaching staff had even begun eyeing the 20-foot pile of trash in the school's courtyard -- rusted upturned desks, broken chairs, rotting books -- that sat waiting to be hauled off by sanitation officials. It looked like the barricade in the musical of "Les Miserables." His teachers, however, were relatively unconcerned by the material deprivation, which, after all, is commonplace in the city's schools. For the previous half-hour, they had been debating a far more pressing issue: What to do with Lydia?
The discussion was unusual not least for its occurring at all. In most of the city's public schools, teachers were just returning for the first time since June. Because principals have to wait to see who returns before making final staffing decisions, many teachers don't know whom or even what they will be teaching until weeks after classes have begun. The lucky ones receive computer-generated lists of their students' names and vital statistics: ID numbers, dates of birth, how well they did on the previous year's citywide reading and math tests. But it's usually something of a minor miracle if they have stories to go with any of their new students' faces or names. As one S.P.C. teacher described her old school: "There wouldn't be room keys. There wouldn't be class lists. It would be so disorganized, and it would be October."
At S.P.C., however, teachers seemed to know everything about their students' lives. Like coaches on draft day, they had been swapping students to try to assemble the best teams:
Teacher No. 1: How about trading your three sixth graders for my three seventh graders?
Teacher No. 2: But I can't put Lydia and Joseph together.
No. 1: Lydia was out for two months last year.
No. 2: Her sister ran away and her mother died.
No. 1: O.K. How about Jackie and Justine switch.
No. 2: Then we could put Lydia with Kenya.
No. 1: Also, Forrest's parents want him to have the same teacher.
Teacher No. 3: O.K., I'll take him.
This personal approach is really at the heart of the School for the Physical City. What makes S.P.C. different from so many other public schools in New York is not so much its hands-on curriculum, progressive as it is, but its size, from which everything else follows. In most junior-high and high schools in New York, teachers regularly see as many as 180 students a day in classes of 34 students, the legal limit. At S.P.C., however, there are fewer than 180 kids in the whole school and no class has more than 20 students.
I know from my own experience teaching for three years at two different public schools in upper Manhattan how important school size and class size are. Both of my elementary schools had more than 1,500 students in facilities originally built for roughly half that many, and I had anywhere from 30 to 34 students in my third- and fourth-grade classes. It seems silly to have to say it, but that's way too many kids. Every once in a while, when a snowstorm would keep half the class at home, I'd get a taste of what teaching might be like at a tony private school. Suddenly, all my difficulties in the classroom would evaporate. I instantly saw how the School for the Physical City could work.
Smaller classes unleash a kind of domino effect of reforms in a school. With fewer students, teachers can devote more time to their lessons. They can give more complicated assignments and spend more time correcting them. They can know students individually and follow their social and academic progress closely, without having to rely on crude, standardized means of assessment. They can communicate more effectively with parents. And, because the school's staff is so small, it can sit around a table, like that in Mark's office, and make decisions about the shape and design of the school, instead of getting caught up in the bureaucracy. Is it any wonder, then, that smaller classes have long been the chief pedagogical tool of most private and parochial schools?
If this all sounds stunningly common-sensical, it is. Yet it took a visionary to see the need for such reforms and to make them happen. The reform movement known as Smaller Schools of Smaller Classes began 20 years ago with one of those incidents that at the time seems like nothing at all but that, one later realizes, was the precipitating event of a revolution.
In the spring of 1974, Anthony Alvarado, then a new, reform-minded superintendent in District 4 in East Harlem, asked a woman named Deborah Meier if she wanted to start her own school. At the time, Meier was just another schoolteacher frustrated by the system. Alvarado couldn't offer her much, just a few classrooms inside another building. She'd have to recruit her own students. (This was billed as giving parents "choice.") She began unceremoniously with six teachers, one assistant and fewer than 100 students: "I said, 'Let's have smaller classes and put everyone in the classroom,' and I got an answering machine to take care of the office."
At the time, "choice" wasn't the buzzword it is today. It simply provided Alvarado and Meier with a certain amount of political cover. If parents didn't like the school, they were free to take their kids elsewhere. In return, Alvarado gave Meier virtual autonomy over curriculum and hiring decisions. Such freedom was against union and Board of Ed rules at the time, but Meier encountered little opposition at first. Frankly, no one cared what she was up to.
Meier's success is now legendary. (She went on to win a MacArthur Award, the so-called "genius grant," for her work in the district.) Central Park East, the school she started, has spawned dozens of similarly small "choice" schools in the city. The essence of her reforms was a single idea, what might be called her 20-20 vision for reform. She explained: "Not only is 20 the maximum workable number of students in a class. It's also the largest workable number of teachers in a school. Ideally, no school should have more than 400 students." Research has since backed up her assumption. A recent study by the American Legislative Exchange Council, an association of state lawmakers, found that a school's size is even more important in determining the performance of students on nationwide tests (like the S.A.T.) than the amount spent per pupil.
Unlike many other school-reform movements, however, in which theory dictates practice, Meier's ideas had arisen from years of experience in the classroom. She eventually teamed up with Theodore Sizer, who is the director of the Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University. It's largely because of their association that New York City received the first of the Annenberg money.
She also began to proselytize about her reforms in Dissent, the quarterly founded by the late democratic socialist Irving Howe, and in The Nation, probably the country's best-known liberal weekly. Weiss remarked: "She has always been interested in education for education's sake. In the 1960's, Debbie was already worried about assessment" -- that is, improved means of measuring students' academic progress. "In the 1960's, I couldn't have cared less about assessment. Debbie's understanding of the whole tradition from Dewey on has been so important. You need someone like her to frame the issues for the American people."
S.P.C. HAS ACHIEVED ITS smaller classes, as Meier did, largely by putting all of its teachers in the classroom -- a reform impossible to duplicate in the city's more overcrowded schools. The overall student-to-teacher ratio in New York is actually close to what it is in a lot of private and parochial schools: about 15 to 1. But many teachers in the city hold what are known as "out of classroom" positions: curriculum coordinators, staff developers, resource or special-ed instructors who provide individual instruction in reading or math.
Mark told me that he would never have started S.P.C. if he hadn't been able to select his own staff. As he put it: "Your teachers are your school." His teachers felt similarly about their principal. As Joel Barsky, a middle-school humanities teacher explained: "School size and all that is important, but Mark is a big part of the success here. A big part. Every teacher who's here chose to be here. That's powerful."
Everyone I spoke to gave credit to the United Federation of Teachers president, Sandra Feldman, for introducing what's now known as the "school-based option," whereby teachers can vote to allow their schools to select their staff, regardless of seniority. The move wasn't popular among much of Feldman's membership, and she had to fight to make it happen. She's eloquent in its defense: "In a small school in which teachers have been working with each other to create something from the ground up, they really need to have a camaraderie and agreed-upon philosophy of education. And if you create a school where the teachers are truly involved in decision-making, including on personnel issues, that's a trade-off for a straightforward seniority system, which is appropriate and needed in a factory-model system."
S.P.C.'s teachers described the school as a kind of life preserver tossed to them. They were drowning at their former schools. Joel Barsky, for instance, worked for four years at Julia Richman, a troubled high school with some 4,000 students that is in the process of being broken up into several of the city's smaller new schools-within-a-school by the Center for Collaborative Education and the Board of Education. He recalled: "The kids were fine. I mean, kids are the same everywhere. The adults were why that school was failing. People had been there 20 years. They were hanging on for dear life. There were teachers there who did nothing. It was unbelievable. I've never seen such despair in children."
Leo Owen, a middle-school math teacher at S.P.C., agreed. Owen immigrated to this country from Guyana in 1983, and became a citizen last year. He has a soft voice, and speaks with a clipped accent. He had taught for nearly 10 years at two different intermediate schools in Brooklyn that had nearly 2,000 students each. He said: "When I entered my first day in a classroom, kids were doing somersaults. I consulted a colleague who said, 'If you're teaching 2 to 3 percent of your students, then you are doing well.' I set very high standards; I lowered my standards. I would tell this to people, and they would say: 'So? You're getting a salary, are you not?' So I used to say to these people: 'Yes, but I have not earned my salary. I am forced to accept a salary under false pretenses.' This," he remarked with characteristic understatement, "did not make me very popular with my colleagues."
About the virtues of S.P.C., however, Leo was glad to testify: "I am happy because of Mark. His administrative style is exactly what mine would be. I work to try to make his vision happen. It makes me happy to fulfill it. He comes up and says, 'You're doing a good job.' That makes me happy. I am happy because of my colleagues. I can tell them even when they are rubbing me the wrong way, and they can tell me. I am happy because of the children. I know I am going to be able to do certain things with them. I'm happy because of the parents, who will talk to me about their children, volunteer information about them. For the first time, I feel as though I'm earning my salary."
S.P.C.'s whole structure, from its borrowed space to its schedule, is literally a page from Deborah Meier's new book, "The Power of Their Ideas." She writes of Central Park East: "We decided on the simplest of schedules: two hours each day in humanities (art, history, literature, social studies), two hours daily of math and science and one hour of advisory" -- meetings in small groups with teachers. S.P.C.'s schedule is similarly divided into two 90-minute periods, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. To the middle of the day, Weiss has added a few electives: French, poetry and tutorials in English and math. The big blocks of time have allowed teachers to team teach, to take field trips and to conduct long experiments.
Last fall, for instance, the middle school studied "activists," a thematic unit in their humanities classes, which covered everything from the Civil War to the fall of Communism. Students read Frederick Douglass, visited homeless shelters, looked at graffiti around town and then, with the guidance of the arts teacher, Lisa Jacobson, designed their own murals. They painted slogans on wide swaths of butcher paper in the hallways. This in turn became the springboard for a writing assignment in which students composed personal statements about themselves and their own beliefs. No lesson was ever just an isolated exercise, but was integrated with whatever else the kids were learning in their other subjects. Throughout, kids were learning about the city, its history, and how to improve their physical and social environment. At one point, Sam Schwartz even gave a guest lecture on being an "infrastructure activist."
A typical day in Edi Juricic's middle-school class, for instance, began with students sitting in a semicircle and talking about the chapters they read the night before in "Black Boy" by Richard Wright. Juricic solicited descriptions of the Jim Crow laws described by Wright, and students discussed their effect. He then moved into a discussion of Reconstruction, and of the Supreme Court decision Plessy v. Ferguson. Kids talked about how to amend the Constitution. Class ended with kids writing in their journals. The period had been a nice mix of history, literature and the law.
It would be wrong, however, to read too much significance into this interdisciplinary way of doing things. For one, the classes aren't that different from many others I've witnessed. The approach isn't so newfangled. Some teachers, who seemed less comfortable with this method, were a little more traditional.
What was different was the smallness. Kids took notes, wrote stories, kept journals, composed essays -- except that now their work received more attention. Discipline problems still arose, but instead of 10 kids disrupting a class of 30, rendering it virtually unteachable, 4 or 5 kids might be snickering in a class of 20. Teachers still struggled, but not as much.
One of the best teachers at S.P.C. is probably Joseph Newkirk, a former mechanical engineer whom Weiss hired on a hunch even though he had no experience in the classroom. In midcareer, Newkirk is one of the five African-American or Guyanan people on staff. He's something of a dapper dresser, given to brightly colored shirts and ties and a brown suede fedora. He has a gray speckled beard, which he rubs when he's thinking, and wide eyes, and the demeanor of someone who has seen it all. For three months, his class built kites as part of a semester-long unit on "Kites in the Wind: How Do They Fly?" Around this ongoing project, Newkirk wove lessons on everything from the molecular content of the atmosphere to the basic principles of aerodynamics to how to write up a formal lab report. Kids built models of their designs. They then field-tested their kites in the school's playground, wrote up what they'd learned and revised their models, building ever bigger and more complex versions.
The day before Christmas vacation last fall, Newkirk's students took their finished projects to Hudson River Park for their maiden flights. They trundled down to the waterfront, dragging their brightly colored kites behind them. Before the flights began, Newkirk gathered his students together to review what they had learned throughout the semester. Kids recited different design principles: "If your kite is narrow, it's easy to get up, but hard to control, but if it's wide, it's hard to get up, and easy to control." They discussed area and aspect ratios. One kid showed me how to determine the kite's height once airborne by calculating the angles with a protractor. Another kid talked knowingly about Bernoulli's principle, which explains the lift produced by a wing having a curved upper surface and flat lower surface. Children's cries filled the park: "Yes, Yes, YES" as one kite finally made it aloft, and "No-o-o-o-o!" as another took a nose dive. All the while, Newkirk ran around, peppering his students with questions: "Try it in the sun. Why would that make a difference?" A kid guessed: "Because the air is warmer?" Newkirk shouted: "Yes! Yes!"
This spring, Newkirk won the prestigious Chancellor's Bright Lights Award for Distinguished Teaching in Mathematics and Science, one of five handed out citywide. The key to Newkirk's success isn't very mysterious. His methods aren't so different from those of lots of good teachers at S.P.C. and elsewhere: he works extremely hard, and prepares assiduously for class. (He was at the school all hours of the day.) His seemingly endless enthusiasm has made up for his lack of experience. He has the respect of his students and is good at maintaining discipline. And he has made particularly good use of the resources that the partners have provided: professors and computers at Cooper, the Mission Society's 2,000-acre campsite in upstate New York. About Newkirk, Weiss had his own happy litany: "I love his spirit; there's just something about the person that's intangible. I love his willingness to grow. I love that he comes from the background of so many of the kids he teaches. I love that he's successful."
Newkirk has done well, however, partly because the job has been made manageable: not too many kids, not too many classes. He's had a principal and colleagues who have supported him daily in his classroom and share his vision for the school. In an enormous school, Newkirk -- any good teacher -- might have drowned along with the students.
FOR MANY KIDS, THE individual attention they receive at S.P.C. comes as something of a shock. As Marianne Melendez, a middle-school humanities teacher, put it: "Some of these kids are used to being 'lost' in school -- that's the norm -- so they feel like you're coming down hard on them when you care. No one has ever asked them for anything -- expected anything from them -- before. So, when you call on them in class, they think they're being singled out. They think you're constantly in their face. Some of these kids have difficulty just expressing themselves because they've had no practice talking in class. Their classes before were so big, they were literally never, ever called on."
Reducing class and school size hasn't solved all of S.P.C.'s problems. Several teachers complained about the lack of supplies. But thanks largely to the political clout of its partners, S.P.C. has now secured itself a renovated plant. The school, designed by Carmi Bee, is five floors of colorful exposed pipes, air-conditioning ducts and industrial-size windows. It looks a little like the Pompidou Center on the inside, and the idea behind the design is similar: to reveal the building's infrastructure.
But S.P.C. is unusual in having acquired its own home; citywide there is a moratorium on building or renovating school space. Even with smaller classes, nearly all of the teachers complained of 16-hour days, of having to wear too many hats, which they changed with almost Buster Keaton-like dexterity. As Weiss, the son of a former union organizer, said: "All of us work much harder than we have to. You have to put in long hours. You have to spend your own money. Our obligation isn't the same as a G.M. worker who's making money for the boss. I don't mind if we're exploited a little. We're educating working-class kids."
Still, before big vacations -- Christmas or the February break -- there was a sense of everyone staggering toward the finish line, exhausted, as after a marathon. And with everyone busy in the classroom, one sick teacher could throw the whole school into chaos. Meg Campbell of the Harvard Outward Bound Project remarked: "I think everyone, including us, just underestimated the extent of the infrastructure that one has to build to have a school function -- just getting the pencils ordered! Starting new schools right now in the school reform movement is a very romantic thing to do. And I think some of us got caught up in that romanticism."
Mark described teaching in the city as a continual exercise in "making do." Most new schools, for instance, begin with the bottom few grades, and then add a grade a year, until the school is completed. Weiss, however, made a calculated decision to begin S.P.C. with the sixth and seventh grades, and then tacked on a ninth-grade class as well. The reason, he admits now, was money: high schools are given more money for start-up costs than the city's junior highs. Consequently, Weiss was able to wring a few more badly needed dollars from the Board of Ed.
Starting a junior high and high school simultaneously, however, proved overwhelming, and Weiss came to regret the decision. "It wasn't a sound decision educationally, but at the time, we convinced ourselves that it was. You rationalize because you need the money." This year, Weiss added an eighth grade, but not another high-school class. The 10th grade -- last year's 9th -- remains, though its students and teachers expressed a strong sense of having been abandoned.
One of the most frequent charges against public school "choice" is that it's elitist and that its self-selection process leaves students who don't have savvy parents in the worst public schools. The middle-school students at S.P.C. are mostly there because their parents sought out the school, but the high-schoolers were mostly randomly assigned to S.P.C. by the Board of Ed. Consequently, they didn't necessarily have any particular interest in the school's emphasis and many of them, having languished for eight years in the city's regular public schools, were ill prepared for high-school level work. Yet for all of the 10th-graders' difficulties, S.P.C. has still given them, by any measure, a better education than they would have received in the city's regular high schools. Their reading scores, for instance, jumped an impressive 10 percent on average in the first year alone, simply because the school is giving them more individual attention.
Naomi Barber, a project director of the Fund for New York City Public Education, finds the charge of elitism particularly frustrating. She explained: "We wanted to start a 'gifted and talented' program at one school in Harlem. And the director said: 'I don't believe in "gifted and talented." ' She thought it was elitist. But it's not as if rich white kids -- or even rich black kids -- were going there. These were neighborhood kids. All 'gifted and talented' means, really, is academically rigorous. This is something the parents in that community desperately need and want." And indeed this spring, the fund received several thousand applications for a few hundred openings at its "New Vision" schools.
AT OUR LAST INTERVIEW, MARK WEISS TOLD me: "I don't think a story like this should say, 'If he can do it, anyone can.' Some of us can make do with less, but that doesn't mean that everybody can, and then there's a point at which you can't make do." No curriculum, no matter how progressive or traditional, can work in atrociously overcrowded schools, where students are anonymous, teachers have little control over their curricula and principals have virtually no say in how their schools are run. Yet this is precisely the situation in the vast majority of the city's schools. There are some 65,000 teachers in the New York City schools alone. If the system is ever going to work, it's going to have to work for more average talents. There aren't enough superheroes to go around.
Unlike so many other school reforms, which depend on the way they're implemented in the classroom, the effort to achieve smaller schools and smaller classes is both measurable and easily replicable. Even a mediocre teacher is more effective in a class of 20 than in a class of 34. Similarly, there's just a limit to the number of students that even the best teacher can have and not regard them as a mob.
An $8 billion annual education budget may sound like a lot of money, but if you divide that amount by more than a million students, it actually comes to less than $8,000 a year per pupil -- about the nationwide average -- for a school system with greater-than-average challenges: poverty, violence and a large pool of immigrant students who are unfamiliar with this country's language and culture. The amount will only shrink as enrollments rise and the budget continues to be slashed. None of the money that has been cut as waste from the central Board of Ed has been redirected to the classroom. The savings have gone solely to alleviate the city's larger budget woes.
Meier, for one, is worried. "It scares me when I look at the closing down of after-school programs, youth centers, summer school. That adds to the work we do. Our schools have always relied on the system to provide certain things. The notion of going out and trying to raise private funds to replace that is terrifying. The entire Annenberg challenge has to raise $50 million from private foundations and that doesn't leave a lot left over; and the places that get it will likely be the ones who need it least. We'll end up competing against ourselves." Even the Annenberg "challenge" has not produced the outpouring of philanthropy that many people expected. There is just not enough private money out there to replace government spending entirely.
The popular issues in education these days tend to focus on what have been called the "culture wars." It's a testament to Meier and company's seriousness that they have stayed away from such hot-topic debates, which have served only to distract most politicians and education pundits from far more pressing concerns.
Recently New York City was consumed by a two-year debate over the ill-fated Rainbow Curriculum, a 600-page guide put out by the city's Board of Education that encouraged teachers to teach tolerance of all races, cultures and -- here's where it got controversial -- sexual orientation. "What most people don't realize," Meier explained with some exasperation, "is that there isn't a teacher in the city who reads those curriculum guides that the Board of Ed puts out -- much less a 600-page one! But someone calls you up and so you have to take a position on it." It's not that such issues aren't important. What makes them so popular is that debating them costs, and requires, nothing. But they have virtually no impact on the classroom.
Smaller schools and smaller classes do work, but it remains to be seen whether the city and the country are serious enough about education reform to finance them. The city will eventually have to spend some money if it has a prayer of improving its schools: to build more space to relieve the gross overcrowding, to hire more teachers to handle the rise in enrollment, to provide basic supplies. That, or suffer a dysfunctional school system. As Meg Campbell remarked: "There are no economies of scale in education. You can't design a school the way you design a factory. Schools are more like families: having 34 children isn't necessarily the best thing."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Casting Calls For Towels, Toys And You-Name-It On the Stage

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
GEORGE FENMORE COULD NOT be happier. He has put a chicken on Broadway. And not just any chicken. A Tyson-Holly Farms chicken. It makes its entrance swathed in butcher paper in the second act of "Having Our Say," the new play at the Booth Theater in which at every performance two actresses playing centenarian sisters dress, stuff and slide into the oven a fresh, corn-fed roaster.
Mr. Fenmore, an expert at locating the sundry items sometimes required to fill a New York stage, was thrilled to have been able to cast the chicken, and not simply because there are so few good parts on Broadway for poultry. To Mr. Fenmore, a bird in the oven is a major achievement, the result of hours spent on the phones sweet-talking secretaries and schmoozing with public-relations people in an effort to coax companies into donating products to Broadway and Off Broadway shows. 
 For 45 years he has been practicing a trade that has turned into a niche business, recalling a Broadway of another era. The actors in "Damn Yankees" need shoes off the ball field? Mr. Fenmore brings Hush Puppies to the rescue. The Pink Ladies of "Grease" chew bubble gum incessantly? Mr. Fenmore strikes a deal with Dubble Bubble. The hotel room set of Neil Simon's Off Broadway "London Suite" has to be stocked with European-size 500-milliliter bottles of Diet Coke? Mr. Fenmore is on the horn to Coca-Cola in England.
Evian water, Martex towels, Libbey glassware, Harrods shopping bags from London, Ocean Spray juice -- the wine in "Passion" was Ocean Spray Cranberry Grape -- have all made their way onto New York stages care of Mr. Fenmore and his prodigious sources, many of whom pay him a modest fee for placing products. Sometimes, the items are seen briefly; sometimes, for an entire act. And sometimes, they are taken home by members of the audience, as during "Grease," when a teacher (played by JoAnne Worley) tosses an elbow-length white glove into the crowd.
"The gloves are by Fownes," Mr. Fenmore said, as he sat in his office on West 54th Street, theater memorabilia and boxes of consumer goods scattered everywhere. "Sometimes, she can only throw it as far as the orchestra pit, so then they re-use it."
The world of product placement, the stage version, is a place inhabited more by prop people than marketing experts, a quaint throwback to an old style of theatrical promotion that owes more to the spirit of Walter Winchell than Walt Disney.
In Hollywood, it often refers to a deal in which a candy manufacturer, say, pays a movie maker thousands of dollars and more so that an extraterrestrial in "E. T." will munch on a certain candy bar.
But on the New York stage, product placement occurs when a show is fortunate enough to find a company -- any company -- willing to donate its products. And for this the provider gets almost nothing in return aside from the altruistic satisfaction of helping to lower the cost of a play, and a brief credit buried deep in Playbill.
"People do read the credits; they really do," insisted Ruth Sussman, who is the only other person in New York doing product placement full time for the theater. Actually, neither Mr. Fenmore, involved in a variety of Broadway merchandising ventures, nor Ms. Sussman, an ardent fan of the theater, makes a living placing products; there is not enough money in it.
In Hollywood, where consumer-products companies spend an estimated $50 million a year placing brands on the big screen, the dollar figures can be astronomical: several years ago, Philip Morris paid $350,000 to get its brand Lark cigarettes into the James Bond movie "License to Kill."
On Broadway, by contrast, product placement can be worth less to a show than the price of a single ticket. "Having Our Say," which was capitalized at $1.2 million, saves about $2.50 per show by having the roaster donated by Tyson Foods.
"In the scheme of things, it's a small amount of money," said Martin Gold, the production stage manager for "Having Our Say." "Our average food costs are about $275 a week. It really has little meaning. But we always try to promote things because there's a natural instinct to do that."
IF ANYONE POSSESSES THE instinct, it is Mr. Fenmore, a 68-year-old Brooklyn native who made his Broadway debut in the 1940's as a teen-ager working behind theater concession stands. He has been on the merchandising side of the stage ever since.
The walls of his office are lined with posters from the dozens of productions for which he has labored; the contents of a storeroom across the hall look like the discards from an unsuccessful flea market but are actually props and products placed in shows past. There are blenders and hair dryers, telephones and Tupperware. A bicycle used in "The Goodbye Girl" lies in a corner.
"This auditioned for a show, and failed," Mr. Fenmore said, pointing to a four-slice toaster.
Three blocks away, Ms. Sussman works the phones from a desk near the living-room window in her elegant apartment. Although the head prop people for some shows do their own acquisitions, Mr. Fenmore or Ms. Sussman handle product placement for virtually all the other productions in town, from the mega-musicals to the nonprofit companies.
Ms. Sussman has placed everything from Yoo-Hoo, the chocolate drink, in "A Few Good Men," to Evian, the water, in "Love! Valour! Compassion!" to an obscure brand of Irish sausage in a revival of Brian Friel's "Philadelphia, Here I Come!" She even arranged for Glenn Close to be wrapped in Martex towels in "Sunset Boulevard."
The Yoo-Hoo was a natural: the author, Aaron Sorkin, had written it into the play. "I thought, 'My God, this is perfect!' " Ms. Sussman said. But the sausage had more to do with one actor's taste for Gaelic culinary verisimilitude than with marketing.
"Milo O'Shea wanted Irish bangers," Ms. Sussman explained. She eventually found a New Jersey company that imported Irish foods and was willing to indulge Mr. O'Shea's appetite for the run of the play.
More than anything else, it is tradition and a love of theater that keep Mr. Fenmore and Ms. Sussman going, and both wonder if anyone will continue to place products on Broadway and off after they are gone. For rarely do such placements make much financial difference. In fact, there are so few product placements in most shows that questions about taste and commercialism never really arise.
Mr. Fenmore says that in the past major manufacturers were interested in maintaining a profile on Broadway, and that several kept him on retainer to place their products in shows, much as some companies do for movies today. It is a matter of economic evolution: the reach of the companies expanded, but the theater's did not.
"I used to be able to call up and, bang, I'd get it," Mr. Fenmore said, as he listed some of the coups of his past, like the can of Diet Pepsi he maneuvered into a sketch in the long-running "Oh! Calcutta!" and the antique vacuum cleaner he secured from the Hoover people for the 1970 revival of "No, No, Nanette."
Now, however, very few things come easily, not even chickens, which took a dozen phone calls to various poultry companies -- some of which were never returned -- to arrange. In the end, Mr. Fenmore said, Tyson Foods, based in Arkansas, agreed to supply the play with coupons for the chickens that can be redeemed at local markets. In return, the company gets "Chickens courtesy of Tyson Foods Inc." in the program, next to the notice about fire exits.
THE PRODUCT PLACERS NOT only have to find suppliers willing to donate the items, they must also negotiate their own fees with the companies, never the shows. "It can range from $25 to a few hundred dollars a week," Mr. Fenmore said. "For some, it's per month. Some, it's a flat fee. It's also according to the value of the product, how it's used. So I might expect more if something is used for 25 minutes than if it's ushered off the stage."
Neither of the product placers would discuss their fees in detail, but it is clear that some placements are better than others. In the case of the Tyson chickens, no packaging appears on stage to indicate where the birds come from. But some companies that donate products to Broadway say a display of the logo on stage is not always the point.
Rose Gerace, director of public relations for Westpoint Stevens, which markets the Martex line of bed and bath linens, says she often hears of consumers asking for the towels and sheets that Martex has running on Broadway. Currently there are Martex products in several shows, including "Sunset Boulevard," "Love! Valour! Compassion!" and "Indiscretions."
"It's important to us, because we reach a targeted audience of upscale, culturally oriented people," Ms. Gerace said. "And I love it when the actors walk around on stage with the towels wrapped around their heads and bodies."
Occasionally, a show will allow the placement of a logo. Perhaps the most imaginative this year occurs during the "Coffee Break" production number in "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying": a blimp with the logo for Eight O'Clock Coffee drifts across the backdrop.
Michael David, one of the musical's producers, has decided "there are no rules for this." For example, he said, take "Angels in America": "Product placement doesn't seem appropriate. In 'Hamlet,' product placement doesn't seem doable. But here is a show we're doing for fun."
There is joy in product placement, but there can also be heartbreak, as Mr. Fenmore can attest. For as happy as the chicken placement made him, he was downcast equally by the quick departure of "My Thing of Love," a play with an elaborate set filled with items that he had acquired: sports equipment, toys and clothing. The play, which starred Laurie Metcalf, closed earlier this month after negative reviews.
The closing not only meant that actors were out of work and investors disappointed but that the handiwork of George Fenmore would not be on view. "So many props," he sighed. "My heart was in that show."

HEADLINE: Made in the U.S.A., Once Gloriously, Now Precariously

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
BACK IN 1893, AMERICAN PIANO manufacturers were nervous about a new threat to their trade: the bicycle. With yearly sales of $50 million, that big-wheeled menace loomed over the piano business, luring players out of the parlor and onto the streets.
One commentator thought others would suffer more: "Cigar manufacturers are the ones who have truly felt the advance of the bicycle simply because it is impossible to ride and smoke comfortably." 
 He may have been right, for the bicycle had little impact on the heyday of the American piano. In 1896, the five largest piano manufacturers in the world were American, and more than half the pianos in the world were made here. In 1909, 365,000 pianos were made in the United States by 295 manufacturers.
The American piano, boasting innovations by firms like Chickering and Steinway, had become the premier instrument in the world, displacing Old World instruments, with their less penetrating sonic personalities. The piano was the instrument of a democracy, found in log cabins, parlors, brothels and the White House.
And by 19th-century standards, it was big business. The stakes were so high and competition among manufacturers was so severe that fraud and bribery were common at piano exhibitions and in salesrooms.
"Those who have any knowledge about the piano trade," wrote Music Trades magazine during the piano's prime, "know that it is often conducted with an amount of vehement prejudice, animosity, abuse, slander and vilification, which transcends anything of the kind in any other trade I know."
Today the piano hardly seems worth shouting about. It has suffered one turn of the screw after another -- the bicycle, the radio, the phonograph, the automobile, movies, television, the computer, pop music, video games, the digital keyboard -- and has emerged thoroughly scathed. The number of pianos sold in the United States dropped from 282,000 in 1978 to 99,000 last year. Some see the decline as simply a trend, a fluctuation rooted in economics that may be reversed. It seems, instead, part of a long-term transformation of the instrument and its place in American culture. The television and the computer have now become the home's hearth. Communal listening is dominated by pop music. And the piano no longer signifies, as it once did, prestige and social accomplishment. The last two decades have decisively overturned the piano's image and presence.
The statistics are sobering. The 1980's were peppered with bankruptcies. One can no longer purchase a Mason & Hamlin piano, once an American glory. Aeolian is gone; so is Chickering. The upstart Falcone promised a renaissance in design but gave up the ghost after a few years. Only four manufacturers (most notably, Steinway and Baldwin) remain in the United States, and imports from the Far East have slowed their growth.
Even Steinway & Sons has been operating under a shadow. Although a trivial presence on the American scene by the numbers, accounting for fewer than 3 percent of the instruments sold here last year, Steinway remains the most important maker, its instruments still dominating the concert stage and recordings. Founded in 1853 in New York by German emigrants, Steinway has defined the sound of the modern piano; indeed, it exported its sonic ideals back to Germany, where a Steinway factory in Hamburg still realizes them in slightly different fashion for the European market.
The Steinway family sold the company in 1972 to CBS; Steinway Musical Properties purchased it in 1985, and it is now changing hands again with its sale to the Selmer Company (the maker of Bill Clinton's sax). Recent years have seen a decline in sales. According to company documents, sales of American-made Steinway grand pianos fell from 2,128 in the fiscal year 1990 to 1,709 in 1994, a drop of almost 20 percent. Sales of Hamburg grands fell from 1,430 in 1990 to 860 last year. And sales of upright pianos from both factories fell even more sharply. In 1980, Steinway produced 5,048 pianos of all kinds; in 1994, 3,135. Although the company professes optimism, envisioning a return to 1990 levels by 1997, a sense of change is evident: to compete in a broader market, Steinway introduced the lower-priced Boston piano in 1992; made in Japan, it sold 2,300 units last year.
Now, after two decades rife with controversy over quality control and the level of craftsmanship, the company is being acquired by Selmer for $100 million. While the price represents confidence in the firm, the terms of the transaction involve substantial indebtedness and suggest additional risks to the company in a shaky marketplace.
 
Out With the New, In With the Old
 Optimists still believe that the piano has a vital future in this country. After all, new sales may be slow because the market is mature; potential buyers are content with the instruments in use, the best of which never seem to wear out. It is as if cars from the 1940's were still in circulation and valued as highly as current products from Detroit. One industry executive estimates that 800,000 used pianos change hands each year. A survey by Music Trades suggests that only 1 in 10 piano sales involves a new instrument. And piano teaching materials are selling better than ever.
So interest remains considerable. On average, instruments may even have improved: Far Eastern manufacturers have transformed their industry since the days when no-name instruments were assembled in dingy lofts from stock parts. And the piano market does indeed fluctuate.
What's more, tastes continue to shift: the most popular piano for use in the home in the middle of the 19th century was the now extinct "square" piano (which was really a sort of rectangular table). The player-piano accounted for more than half of pianos sold in 1923. The upright and then the small spinet came to be preferred in smaller American homes, but they, too, have declined in importance. The drop in piano sales since 1988 has been almost entirely confined to upright models; grands and mini-grands have become the most stable segment of the market, selling just under 30,000 a year. (In light of that overall stability, however, the recent fluctuations at Steinway are all the more alarming.)
Seven or eight years ago, it seemed that much of the loss in piano sales could be ascribed to a boom in electronic keyboards, at least in the lower-end market. Now even electronic instruments seem irrelevant to the piano's future. The biggest musical success story at the moment is not the digital piano (which has fairly level annual sales of 50,000 units) or the synthesizer (whose sales have dropped from 91,000 in 1988 to 64,000 in 1994) but the acoustic guitar: its annual sales have more than doubled since 1988, with 556,000 instruments sold last year.
There may be simple explanations for all these trends. The surge in guitar sales, for example, may represent increased interest in folk music, as countercultural tastes are passed on to a second generation. Steinway's faltering sales may reflect its continually rising prices; its least expensive grand now costs $26,900, equivalent to six quality uprights from a rival manufacturer.
In any case, the altered status of the piano is more than a matter of trends, styles and prices. The piano has lost its aura, and marketers are straining to give it another. Guessing at the instrument's future requires a better understanding of its past.
 
Hearth and Home, Storm and Stress
 It may seem quaint today, for instance, that the piano was once the social axis of the home, a locus for the display of feminine accomplishment; manuals even suggested ways to carry on courtships at the keyboard. "In many a humble home throughout our land," President Cleveland said a century ago, "the piano has gathered about it the most sacred and tender association."
It was also the instrument of the family. "The true place of this art," William Steinway wrote of piano manufacture in 1872, "is at the altar of home, where it shines calm and effulgent, animating and soothing, in turn, in the form of domestic musical harmony."
Such, at any rate, was the idealized image of the piano. But other forces were compressed in the instrument's wooden case, forces more commonly exposed in the concert hall, in the demonic and extravagant music written for the Romantic piano. The opposite of parlor music, it embodied the very desire, suffering and excess that the parlor instrument was meant to control.
"The Steinway Saga," a remarkable new book by D. W. Fostle, adds to an understanding of this double character of the instrument by examining the history of the Steinway family. Mr. Fostle quotes extensively from newspapers and journals, documenting the evolution not just of the piano but also of a sensibility.
 
A Quagmire Awaits A Visionary Virtuoso
 The key person in the story of the great American piano is not the technical genius Theodor Steinway, who accumulated 40 patents between 1868 and 1885, but his brother William. William Steinway played on society as a virtuoso, building his company, establishing a dealer network, courting endorsements by artists, buying up land in Astoria, Queens, on the East River, to create a workers' community around the factory. When he died, in 1896, the flag was flown at half mast at City Hall.
But this impact came at a cost. The indefatigable entrepreneur could never achieve the domestic harmony he so busily marketed. His wife's adulteries were legendary, and endless machinations were required to protect the family name.
The marketing of the instrument, meanwhile, involved ruthless competition, corruption and accusations of fraud. William Steinway overspent on Astoria real estate. He invested huge sums in an underground train tunnel to Manhattan that eventually had to be abandoned. And his visionary promotion of an early automobile, a "motor quadricycle," failed. "While he could conjure the shape of things to come and places yet to be with preternatural precision," Mr. Fostle observes, "he frequently failed to see the quagmire at his feet." Yet in this combination of dream and quagmire the modern piano took shape. William Steinway somehow united the forces of industry, commerce and art without ever turning the piano into a mere commodity.
In the 20th century, however, the modern urban world that he envisioned helped undermine the culture of the piano. The instrument remained a fixture in American homes for much of this century, out of habit if not belief. But by the late 1970's, its public and private oratory became less important; as its repertory lost ground in American culture, so did the piano.
Another deep wound came in the 1980's, from portable electronic keyboards, which are almost explicit inversions of the piano: their primary repertory of rock and pop has often been written in opposition to the bourgeois world that gave the piano life. Yamaha, which had a strong foothold in electronics, was almost alone in seeing that there were ways to combine advanced technology with the traditional instrument, first by creating "home" digital pianos, then by making the first significant innovations in the instrument in the last 50 years.
Yamaha's Disklavier pianos -- computer-equipped standard instruments that can record and play performances using floppy disks -- now account for 8 percent of income from piano sales in the United States. Yamaha also produces a "silent" piano, on which the hammers can either strike strings or be electronically sensed to allow listening through headphones. Steinway, following Yamaha, now offers a computerized player-piano add-on for its instruments.
 
A Brave New World Of Marketing Jargon
 But since these hybrids have to be sold as pianos, the question comes back to the future of the instrument itself, which may have changed in substance as well as image. On the surface, current instruments can seem as good as those of yore, or better. A recent tour of the Steinway factory in Queens showed an apparently serious effort to improve the instrument. The final stages of manufacture receive more attention than they did a few years ago. Outside technicians have also reported improvements in Steinways, a heartening sign. Yet how things have changed from earlier decades!
It would take an expert in piano manufacture to determine where mechanical advances might create musical compromises or whether apparent improvements might affect an instrument's personality. But wood was once aged in the yards outside the factory for up to five years; now the peak time is 14 months. The manufacturing process was once guided by a Steinway family member with an intimate knowledge of the instrument and its past.
CBS broke with that tradition, and its successors have strayed still farther. Daniel Koenig became vice president of manufacturing in 1987, knowing nothing of the instrument; he spoke at the time of "debriefing the old-timers." He was recently replaced by Roy Chesseri, who had been working for a company that develops waste-water treatments and speaks of the need for "consistency" in the manufacturing process.
Selmer promises to change nothing at Steinway, but the world around it has already changed. Karen Hendricks, who recently left Procter & Gamble to become president of the Baldwin Piano and Organ Company, compared the piano to products she had worked with, like Crest toothpaste and Dial soap, calling it a "branded business." She is conducting marketing surveys to determine what image consumers hold of Baldwin (which made 28,000 pianos last year); she plans to target new markets with new images and expresses optimism about "building the category," increasing the penetration of pianos in American homes.
"The industry is very insular and traditional," Ms. Hendricks explained. "It is not trying to get its message to the end-user."
Makeovers may help, but image will still need to be connected with substance. The fate of Steinway is crucial, as is the quality of the few instruments it turns out. So is the fate of the music. With nothing to attach to the piano but custom-designed images for consumers, and nothing to guide its evolution but ideas about modern manufacturing techniques, only the instrument's repertory serves as a reminder of the importance the piano once had, the dangers it controlled, the opportunities it offered and the bicycles it could once safely ignore.

HEADLINE: CHOICE TABLES;
Los Angeles Dining Is Back, With Gusto

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER; BRYAN MILLER is a reporter for the style department of The Times.

 BODY:
THIS year appears to mark the beginning of Los Angeles's recovery from those urban afflictions -- a major earthquake, riots, floods and brush fires -- that affected the city's economy on many levels. The restaurant scene that had come to a near standstill a year and a half ago is burgeoning once again. Two areas covered here -- Old Town Pasadena and Santa Monica -- mirror the new vitality and optimism that are restoring Los Angeles to its role as a center of gastronomy.
All lunch and dinner prices listed below are for a three-course meal for two, with a glass of wine and tax, but not tip. 

 
Les Arts
Old Town Pasadena has undergone a remarkable renaissance in the past five years, with the restoration of vintage buildings and an influx of business, young professionals and new restaurants. Many of the dining spots lining Colorado Boulevard, the main commercial artery, are undistinguished pasta joints and forgettable Chinese outlets. Others, like winsomely designed Twin Palms, owned by the actor Kevin Costner, are exuberant places for people watching, while the food receives mixed reviews. For more ambitious food in Old Town, it is best to head to Raymond Avenue, which intersects Colorado Boulevard.
 One place you will find on Raymond Avenue is Les Arts, an eight-month-old French restaurant offering refined contemporary fare at reasonable prices. The low-key dining room is a canvas of white displaying a changing gallery of paintings by local artists -- an exemplary idea, sometimes. On a recent visit, the overbearing wildlife paintings appeared ready to jump out and snatch your appetizer.
The menu at Les Arts is grounded in traditional French cooking, and lunch is an extraordinary bargain. One classic dish is the starter of veal shank terrine layered with artichokes and asparagus. Unfortunately, the terrine was served so cold that its flavors were muted. Zucchini flowers are stuffed with a sprightly combination of tomatoes and zucchini, and served with a Provencal-style tomato and herb sauce.
The French-American wine list offers some splendid selections at fair prices, including a 1990 Quincy, a faintly tart white, for $25, and a 1991 Cahors, a robust red, for $19.
Main courses are straightforward and well-focused: salmon wrapped in bacon with a red wine sauce and potato cake; fillet of beef in a sauce of sweet shallot confit and balsamic vinegar; and perfectly cooked tuna steak ringed with spring vegetables and served over a sweet-onion compote with well-seasoned zucchini slivers.
Les Arts also serves one of the few assorted cheese platters I saw in Los Angeles. As for dessert, the kitchen was out of saffron ice cream with green-apple sauce, so we chose a homemade ice cream assortment (cinnamon is best). Assorted tarts looked wonderful.
Dinner at Les Arts is about $70; a little-advertised prix fixe lunch (three courses) is $11 a person, while the regular lunch runs about $20 a person.
 
Xiomara
On the north side of Colorado Boulevard is a bistro that could be at home in the tonier environs of Santa Monica or Beverly Hills. Xiomara, named for Xiomara Ardolina, the owner, has a cool and jazzy feeling, with beveled mirrors, black lacquered chairs, white columns and sprightly artwork.
The chef, Patrick Healy, made his mark at the Champagne restaurant, which closed about three years ago. His love for home-style cooking can be seen in dinner entrees such as a seductive braised veal shank with root vegetables, and rustic cassoulet made with lamb shoulder, duck confit, slab bacon and pork ribs. Less robust options include Mr. Healy's piquant crisped salmon steak with black peppercorn sauce, and seared sea bass with a spicy stir-fry of vegetables. A $12 bouillabaisse on Monday and Tuesday evenings is a singular bargain, as is the daily lunch special for $12.50.
If you plan an extensive walking tour of Pasadena after lunch to work it off, the foie gras terrine, served at the table with delicious port jelly, is excellent. A recommendable entree is grilled sea bass enhanced with dried fennel and artichokes. Even though the thermometer was pushing 70 degrees, we could not resist the duet of full-flavored sausages (pork with garlic and thyme, and sweetbread sausage) with Swiss chard and creamy mashed potatoes.
Pear tart tatin with a brittle, airy crust was superb with vanilla ice cream.
Dinner runs about $75. A three-course bistro menu is available nightly for $25 a person. Lunch for two with wine is about $60; there is a special bistro lunch for $12.
 
Yujean Kang's
The portly, baby-faced chef who gave his name to this restaurant clearly has fun creating what might be called new wave Chinese cuisine. His presentations are often whimsical and, more important, the flavors generally harmonize.
The dining room of his four-year-old restaurant on North Raymond Boulevard is decorated in rust-brown desert tones, with Oriental prints on the walls, roomy tables and an affable staff.
One of the more popular first courses is called Pictures in the Snow, something one has to see. A julienne of chicken, smoked duck and black mushrooms is served in a rich duck stock, and the whole dish is covered with a snowfall of meringue on which the chef creates little dioramas with carved vegetables.
We did not sample Ants on the Tree (sauteed beef with black sesame seeds), but the subtle tea-smoked duck salad with black bean dressing can be recommended. The same goes for the superb loin of lamb garnished with crunchy threads of jellyfish and minced hot chilies.
Yujean Kang's has a sizable wine list, mostly Californian, and many of the selections go well with this kind of food. One to try is the dry and distinctive 1992 Chalone chenin blanc, $30.
Dinner for two is $50 to $60; about 30 percent less at lunch.
In Santa Monica, both prices and skirts are a notch higher than in Pasadena. This vivacious community attracts visitors from afar for its shopping, swimming and social scene. It is home to some stylish out-of-town restaurants, including Bice and Remi from New York. The food found in Santa Monica is as varied and unpredictable as the tides.
 
Abiquiu
Consider John Rivera Sedlar, a chef who specializes in hyphenated cooking (California-Thai, Cape Cod-Mexican) and built a fervid young following at his Japanese-influenced Bikini in Santa Monica. Earthquake damage closed it in early 1994.
The dauntless Mr. Sedlar returned to the scene last year with a new venture, Abiquiu, named after a town in New Mexico near his great-grandparents' homestead.
You suspect that you are in for a wild and woolly ride when you read in Mr. Sedlar's menu notes that his search for modern Southwest cuisine took him to Mexico, Japan, Chile, Russia, France, Italy and Hong Kong.
Abiquiu is a big, brash two-level space with water cascading down one wall and blue screens on another that look like televisions on the blink. On the upper level, a colorful tamale bar attracts a young, rakish crowd.
Among the more interesting starters are scallops wrapped in shredded phyllo paired with crisp, lemony tasting cactus and a sweet corn ragout. The peculiar sounding Cape Cod tamale is a winner, too, combining chunks of Maine lobster and steamed asparagus glossed with lemon-tarragon butter.
It is not easy matching wines to this polymorphic food. The best route might be crisp, high-acid whites, such as pinot blanc or sauvignon blanc, or low-tannin reds such as merlot from California, Spain or France. The list offers something in each categoryat average prices.
If your life has never been enriched by a Banzai Tamale of air-dried duck, this is a good place to remedy the situation. The smoky tasting duck meat is garnished with shiitakes, bok choy, ginger and soy. Also superior is the tender and lightly smoked antelope haunch in a red wine and garlic sauce.
If a coconut ice cream banana split seems too mundane, there is pumpkin brulee over a base of firm pumpkin meat.
Dinner is about $70.
 
The Ivy at the Shore
This restaurant, facing the Santa Monica Pier, is the casual and cacophonous sibling of The Ivy on Robertson Boulevard in midtown Los Angeles. With a white rattan ceiling, tropical art, tall palms and shadowy lighting, it has the feel of an island resort -- a tourist-packed island resort.
The Ivy specializes in longshoreman portions at yacht captain prices. Crab cakes are better than average, dark, crisp and well-seasoned;pizzas are a good option, too.
If you have been surfing all day, your appetite might sustain the log pile of moist and crunchy fried chicken with brussels sprouts, whipped potatoes and mango chutney. The charred lime-marinated chicken is a winner, too. Grilled fish -- swordfish, salmon, tuna -- is reliable, except for the bland summer-squash puree (ask for the excellent whipped potatoes instead). Service can be spotty because of the nightly mob scene.
Coffee is served in a gargantuan ceramic cup that could double as a birdbath.
Dinner runs about $90.
 
Valentino
In this oceanside city with its endless-summer mood, Valentino sticks out like a tuxedo on the beach. On a given night you will probably see more ties and formal dresses here than in the rest of Santa Monica combined. But Valentino is hardly stuffy, a reflection of the genial host, Piero Selvaggio, and his sharp staff.
The main dining room is soft, muted and accommodating. Several appetizers are worth seeking out, especially the house special of porcini tort with fondutas (fondue with Piemontese cheese) and the soothing barley, potato and Tuscan bean soup. One evening we sampled a delightful special of scallops wrapped in prosciutto over a ragout of artichokes and porcini.
Specials might include a perfectly roasted roulade of rabbit loin infused with thyme, brittle-skinned quail, or seasonal risotti. Dishes to look for on the main menu include pork loin with sweet peppers and tomato, herbaceous loin of lamb, sweetbreads in a mushroom-Marsala sauce, and a harmonious pasta dish, pennette alla Arrabiata.
Mr. Selvaggio has assembled one of the best wine selections in Los Angeles, with older vintages and hard-to-find wines from various regions in northern Italy.
Among desserts, there are a splendin hazelnut semifreddo; chocolate purses with custard and creme anglaise, and nougat with fresh raspberry compote.
Dinner averages about $110; Friday lunch about $40.
 
Rockenwagner
One might expect Wiener schnitzel and dumplings at a place with this name. Instead, what you find at this fantastical, big post-modern dining room a short walk from the ocean is a menu offering Vietnamese happy pancakes (a wheat flour pancake topped with shrimp), roasted duck with cherry-ginger sauce, and roasted pork tenderloin with goat cheese wrapped in shredded filo.
Hans Rockenwagner, the congenial European-trained chef, has created a setting that is as eclectic and audacious as his food. Playful log-cabin motifs overhead blend with post-modern accents in Souththwestern colors -- Daniel Boone meets Michael Graves.
The kitchen's reach is impressive, if not always successful. Look for dishes like sauteed jumbo shrimp over crisped noodle cakes with black bean sauce, and the nicely charred roasted duck set over a cherry sauce accented with ginger. Among starters, a construction of lightly smoked Atlantic salmon, potatoes and creme fraiche was ordinary. Moreover, the advertised caviar turned out to be flying-fish eggs that were mixed in with a salty sauce. The best part of the crab souffle was the intense lobster sauce served with it; the souffle itself had mostly air going for it.
Desserts are splendid, particularly the warm chocolate tart with a hazelnut parfait, and a nougat parfait with fresh berries. Rockenwagner has a well-selected, highly personal wine list with fair prices.
Dinner is about $70; lunch is about $40.

HEADLINE: 'A Moment on the Earth'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I feel I must respond to Michael Specter's review of Gregg Easterbrook's book. There are so many flaws in both the reasoning and the facts that it is difficult to know where to begin. For now, I'll target a few seemingly innocent sentences that I believe point to the nature of both Mr. Easterbrook's and Mr. Specter's biases. 
 Mr. Specter writes, "He explains with clarity why so many educated people are so afraid of tiny risks from things they don't understand, like alar or dioxin, that they will buy bottled water in a city with no water problems and extremely expensive organic fruit when there is no need to waste the money." This sentence makes clear the myopic economic analysis implicit in Mr. Easterbrook's views.
By limiting the argument to this framework, he misses what is important: face-to-face contact with the people growing the food we eat; healthier workers, farmers and communities; soil and ground water uncontaminated by pesticides, fungicides and herbicides. The organic produce I buy at outdoor markets is clearly, quantifiably, qualitatively better produce. It's fresher, sweeter and tastier. Many older, almost lost varieties are now flourishing again in family orchards and on small farms. The variety in some cases is astonishing: often four or five different types of broccoli, plums, apricots, peaches and potatoes, often a dozen different varieties of apples, tomatoes and peppers. Just as astonishing, organic produce is often less expensive than supermarket produce.
Mentioning the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, Mr. Specter refers to "the remarkable regenerative powers of nature." I won't argue with this statement. I tend to agree with it. I would, however, argue with the conclusion that policy makers, corporate heads, government bodies and others will draw from statements like this one.
The human body is remarkably regenerative as well -- one night's heavy drinking is, though often painful the next morning, forgotten two or three days later. But daily alcohol or tobacco abuse over decades will cause irreparable damage to the body, shortening the life span and perhaps having an insidious impact on the very quality of that shortened life. This is the real analogy, and the real danger of what we are doing to the earth. And, of course, to ourselves.

HEADLINE: An Immigration Disaster?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While it is understandable that Nicholas Lemann would employ a deliberately neutral tone in his review of Peter Brimelow's inflammatory "Alien Nation: Common Sense About America's Immigration Disaster" (April 16), less detachment and more context might have proved beneficial. 
 Mr. Lemann notes in the concluding paragraph that "Mr. Brimelow's definition of 'alienated' is political . . . and his definition of 'America' is racial." But throughout the rest of the review he seems almost at pains to report even Mr. Brimelow's most outrageous assertions without comment, as in "What is required for the successful functioning of a nation, he insists, is 'a link by blood.' "
On the contrary, it is not (as Mr. Brimelow would like us to believe) the multiethnic makeup of society that leads to genocide in Bosnia and Rwanda or communal violence in India, but rather the cynical manipulation of well-founded fears among the populace to gain political advantage or provide distraction from underlying economic and social conditions. And as both Proposition 187 and Mr. Brimelow's book painfully demonstrate, political commentators and politicians in the United States have not been above such hatemongering and scapegoating.

HEADLINE: GRANT US PEACE

 BODY:
I should have known from John Tierney's blase voice as we spoke on the telephone what sort of article he was writing (The Big City: "Grant Us Peace," May 7). Somehow, he didn't sound enthusiastic about Grant's Tomb.
By his reasoning, any historic site that falls out of fashion should become fodder for developers and revisionists. Why should our President be housed in an 18th-century, neo-classical palace when a modern corporate building would be more efficient and economical to run? Tierney needn't worry; I'm only joking. 
 As a museum curator and historic preservationist, I hope he, too, was joking. My great-great-grandparents' final resting place might make a nice cocktail lounge and nightspot. But to thus change it would cheapen the memory of every soldier who died during the bloodiest war ever fought in the Western Hemisphere.

The Price of Privatization: Will Labor Get Its Due?

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON; Iver Peterson is the Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
A large and apparently growing chorus of New Jerseyans are nervous and bitter about the drive for lower taxes and less government in the Whitman administration. They are the state employees. It used to be said that public workers accepted low salaries for high job security, but in New Jersey, public employees' salaries are often higher than in the new, depressed wage, post-industrial service sector, and their job security is dwindling every day.
Now Governor Whitman wants to privatize 25 Department of Motor Vehicles offices, the ones that handle paperwork for car titles, licenses and so on. She also wants to close North Princeton Developmental Center and the Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital, sending their patients to, yes, private, nonprofit institutions. About 350 motor vehicle workers would pass from the public to the private sector, while some 2,000 mental health workers could be out of jobs entirely. 
 Aside from Mrs. Whitman's unproven argument that private companies can do as good a job for less (remember that when the motor-vehicle offices were in private hands in the 1980's, they were so slow and so corrupt that the state took them over), the changes raise a question that isn't being asked in all the clutter. What do public employers owe their workers, and is public employment somehow different from private employment?
Clearly the Whitman administration, its members drawn from business and the law, do not think there is any difference. The state's first obligation is to operate on behalf of the public in the most efficient manner possible, the Governor says, and if privatization offers a chance to save some money, public workers have no particular claim on the public at large.
Public employee unions, the fastest-growing segment, perhaps the only growing segment, of the labor movement, obviously believe that there is a difference, and that Mrs. Whitman is missing it. For starters, no one can tell private employees in any line of work that they may not go out on strike, but public employment contracts are replete with no-strike rules.
But the unions also advance a moral or social argument on behalf of public employment. Alan Kaufman, a leader of the Communications Workers of America, maintains that the privatization plans for the motor vehicle offices discriminate against women and minorities, since these two groups are heavily represented among state employees.
"In the public sector, women and minorities are disproportionately doing the work," said Mr. Kaufman. "So when they privatize, then they are disproportionately hurting women and minorities and lowering their standards of living, which are already lower than those of men."
But why does working for the private sector "lower" your standard of living? Because, Mr. Kaufman said, in the current economic atmosphere, in which service wages are depressed, state employees now make more, not less, than their private equivalents -- $24,000 a year for a typical Motor Vehicle Services worker, compared to $18,000 in the 24 motor vehicle agencies that are already contracted to privately companies. Add in benefits the gap widens considerably: More paid holidays, a non-contributory pension plan, even the right to collect pay for unused sick leave. Under state law, the only obligation on private contractors of public services is to provide medical insurance.
Now, Mr. Kaufman said with considerable venom, Mrs. Whitman is borrowing a page from the upside-down business world, where laying off workers makes a company's stock go up.
"Higher unemployment raises the stock market," he said, "and in the public sector there is a political calculus that makes your political stock go up the more public workers you get rid of."
Yet public employee unions do not come to this argument entirely innocently. One reason their members' wages and benefits have stood up so well when everyone else's have been stagnant or falling is that the unions have played a ruthless game of politics with public employment, making campaign contributions, endorsing candidates and punishing their enemies at the polls.
Now the politics of public employment is against them, and Mrs. Whitman scores points with voters talking about the jobs she will cut.
A textbook example of the perils of public-employment politics played out in the 1991 legislative races, when the teachers' union punished Governor Florio for taking on several of its sacred financial issues, including his worthwhile attempt to make local districts, and not the state, pay for their own teachers' pensions.
The teachers' strategy worked only too well. It helped produce the landslide Republican legislature, which helped produce the Whitman administration, which is now producing privatization.
That's politics.

HEADLINE: CONFERENCE CALL;
Privatization: Leaner Government, or Just Another Fad?

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
When Republicans talk about reinventing government, they invariably talk about turning public services over to the private sector. Governor Whitman is no exception. When she took office, she promised a far-ranging examination of how and who delivers state services, from testing motor-vehicle emissions to feeding prisoners.
Privatizing at least some of these services, she said, could save taxpayer dollars by forcing private entrepreneurs to bid against one another -- and by letting them use their competitive energy to do a better job of delivering services. 
 So far, she has recommended transferring the Division of Motor Vehicles to private control, and her administration is studying privatization at the Division of Youth and Family Services and the food-service contracts at state hospitals.
Not everyone is happy with this trend. Critics, including public-employee unions whose members' jobs are at stake, say privatization means that government has less contol of its resources and its ability to function as a watchdog. They warn that privatization can easily be just another term for political patronage. And they say that a few dollars saved here and there may cost more in the long run because of reduced services.
The New York Times arranged a conference call with experts on both sides of the issue: Lewis M. Eisenberg, a business executive who is chairman of the New Jersey Advisory Council on Privatization, and Marc Holzer, a Rutgers University professor of public adminstration who is executive director of the National Center for Public Productivity.
Q. How is privatization supposed to work, in theory?
HOLZER I think the underpinning philosophy, which is competition, is a good idea. Competition can do things like lower costs, allow economies of scale, avoid large start-up costs, provide access to specialized skills and training, etc. But I think competition doesn't have to mean privatization. We can achieve the advantages of competition without giving away control over services which really should be in the public domain. I don't think we want private-sector firms running our schools or prisons, for example, and certainly not police departments. What we really need to do is create more competitive entities in the public sector.
EISENBERG I'm not sure that I would agree, activity by activity, with the professor's comments that they shouldn't be open to private competition. The public sector should be allowed to compete with the private sector for the very same services. If you look at some of the successes we've had here at home in New Jersey, in Mercer County or Bergen County, where they've actually privatized a meaningful portion of the correctional facilities, saved the taxpayers a lot of money, and have improved, I think, both by inmate reaction and by recidivism rates.
Q. What does this mean for government employees?
EISENBERG In a free capitalist society, assuming all things are equal, government is overburdened; the costs have basically been breaking the back of the camel. I don't think it serves a worker well to argue for preserving his job by saying that someone in the private sector is willing to accept lower wages and lower fringe benefits for the same job.
HOLZER I think you cut to the core of the question. Is it the same job with the same outcome or have we changed the nature of the service when we moved it to the private sector? If you're dealing with more complicated functions, whether it's air traffic control or corrections or education, is it really the same job people are doing? Or are they operating at a lower level, which has hidden long-term costs for our society?
Q. What, then, should be the goal of government?
HOLZER I think the endgame is service. When you ask the public what it wants, it wants improved services before it wants reduced costs.
I think we're suffering from political hysteria in terms of a desire to cut taxes. If you ask them whether they want better schools or lower taxes, they will almost always select better schools because they understand that's an important long-term payoff.
They want an improved system and they're willing to pay for it, but what I think we lack is the political courage to do that.
EISENBERG I disagree with him strongly; I think the quality of service is integrally interwoven with the costs. I think the 1994 elections and Governor Whitman's election [in 1993] basically said people feel they're being taxed way too much for the services they're getting, and I think we're duty-bound to find those places to try, by using competition as an arrow and a quiver of government, to provide the same or better service at lower cost.
Q. Where do you think privatization will go in New Jersey?
EISENBERG I think the Governor has basically been cautious and at the same time has taken expeditious steps to bring in competition where it can provide the same or better service at lower cost.
There were 20 initiatives that were recommended by the Commission on Privatization at the end of 1994, and 14 of them are in some form of implementation. My expectation is that they will result in $200 million to 300 million in recurring savings to the state.
HOLZER The Governor has got well-intentioned objectives, but I'm a skeptic in terms of how much we need to do in terms of privatization. I think she should be giving public servants more opportunity to compete with the private sector and with each other.
I think there should be more competition within government before we start looking for alternatives on the outside.

HEADLINE: Artful Bond of Yonkers and Italian Town

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
MONTICHIARI, Italy, a city of 17,000 people near Milan, is notable for its open-air market, a 12th-century Romanesque church and a restored 15th-century castle. Except for its hills and proximity to a major city, Montichiari would seem to have little in common with Yonkers, a city of nearly 200,000 beset by all the urban turmoil of the late 20th century.
But Innocenzo Pedretti, a photographer with an open mind and an eye for beauty, was prepared to love Yonkers even before he arrived here from Montichiari one recent morning, when the trees on North Broadway were close to full bloom and the Palisades shimmered across the river like a half-forgotten dream. He had come, he said, with a proposal from the mayor of his hometown to make Montichiari and Yonkers sister cities. 
 The idea arose from a new book of photographs, "Due Paesi" or "Two Cities," which Mr. Pedretti, a retired manufacturer of farm products, produced with Frank Dituri, a Yonkers photographer and high school teacher here who taught Mr. Pedretti photography one summer in Italy. The book features black-and-white photographs of both cities and texts in English and Italian.
The unlikely pairing came about after the book's publisher, the Italian Association of Infra-Red Photography, asked Mr. Pedretti, who was vice president of the group, to produce a book comparing two cities. He invited Mr. Dituri, a specialist in infrared photography, to be the second photographer on the project. But at first the American, who said he considers himself a fine-art photographer and not a documentarian, was not interested.
"They were going to do Milan and New York City, and I thought New York City was a bit of a cliche at this point," Mr. Dituri said. He and Mr. Pedretti discussed the project's evolution the morning after the Italian photographer's arrival in the Lenoir Preserve here, where an exhibition of photographs from "Two Cities" was to open two days later. The Yonkers School District rents a historic mansion on the grounds from Westchester County for $1 a year and bases its Education Cultural Arts Center there. Cooking and horticulture programs are also held at the building.
Mr. Pedretti was accompanied by his daughter, Aida, an economist who was sent to represent Mayor Badilini Giliolo of Montichiari. Three other Montichiari residents also came on the trip, prepared to present artwork, town banners and books to Mayor Terence M. Zaleski of Yonkers at the opening of the show, which runs through June 21.
Mr. Dituri, a widely exhibited artist, said that as discussions about the book with his former student progressed, it had occurred to him to contrast two cities from "middle America and middle Italy."
"Yonkers represents to me a small big city," he said. "It has all the problems of a city, yet many parts look like Scarsdale and Bronxville. If the Yonkerses of America are not safe, then we have problems. They are the new battlegrounds."
The Pedrettis, on the other hand, painted a rosy picture of Montichiari, describing an abundance of jobs, a growing economy based on farming and light industry, a successful integration of immigrants from Ghana and other parts of Africa into the community and a forward-looking Mayor. There were no drug problems in Montichiari, they said, and the city's residents were "very supportive" of welfare programs to combat homelessness and poverty.
"Two Cities," however, does not address politics, economics or quality of life, nor does it draw a definitive portrait of either Yonkers or Montichiari. Instead, the book -- and the exhibition -- consists of highly personal images made by two photographers exploring the creative potential of infrared film. The film, which records light at the red end of the spectrum, produces dramatic effects by turning skies black and rendering foliage a ghostly white.
Mr. Dituri produces abstractions that give little hint that they depict places like Philipse Manor, Yonkers Raceway, Cook Field, Odell Avenue and Roosevelt High School, where he teaches. He called himself "a borderline Surrealist," who avoids obvious infrared effects of that film and instead seeks what he described as "the in-between moments" of experience, when things are "almost ready to happen."
Mr. Pedretti called himself "a slave to the light" who always carries a camera and who learned to see more freely after studying with Mr. Dituri. His photographs present panoramic views of street life as well as landmarks like Fontanelle, where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared in a vision.
The 48-page book, elegantly produced with luminous reproductions, can be purchased for $10 by calling Mr. Dituri at 376-8527. By agreement with Mr. Pedretti, part of the proceeds will benefit the Roosevelt High School West Room Gallery at the Lenoir Preserve, where the "Two Cities" exhibition is hanging.
When the photographs leave here, they will travel to Montichiari, where they will be exhibited in the restored castle. Mayor Giliolo has also invited Yonkers to set up a booth at the city's yearly exposition in April.
When Mayor Zaleski was interviewed after the opening of the exhibition, he called the event a success.
"We were able to establish a beautiful linkage between two cities noted for their beautiful hills," he said. Yonkers already has a sister-city arrangement with Ternopol, Ukraine, he said, and has been approached by Fengcheng, China, to establish ties, but there is no reason why the city cannot also be a sister -- a "big sister," he emphasized -- to Montichiari as well. "You can have many sisters," the Mayor said.

HEADLINE: A House Is Not a Home (but Who's Complaining?)

BYLINE: By THOMAS STAUDTER 

DATELINE: MOUNT PLEASANT

 BODY:
ROBERT CHAMBERLAIN, seemingly well-ensconced in a 10-room "English cottage" set off from a woodsy stretch of road between North Tarrytown and Briarcliff Manor, concedes that at least six months pass before he starts feeling settled in a new home. By all appearances, the 42-year-old Tarrytown native appears comfortably established in the rambling 3,200-square-foot, one-story house he moved into last September.
His residency here, though, is temporary at best. The luxury home -- with each room attractively furnished and decorated -- is on three acres in the Pocantico Hills school district. It is for sale, and Mr. Chamberlain is merely house-sitting until the property sells. 
 The arrangement is one Mr. Chamberlain is thoroughly acquainted with. In the last five years he has lived in seven different residences and, in exchange for reduced rent or no rent at all, has served as a combination house sitter and caretaker for homes on the market. A requirement of his occupancy, however, is that the house must always be clean and presentable, because real estate brokers are allowed to show the property to potential buyers whenever possible throughout the week.
Recently, several factors have led owners and realtors to employ house sitters.
"Fluctuating interest rates, high property taxes and a glut of higher-priced homes have softened the housing market to some extent, with the most effective properties being luxury homes, which are on average for sale or listed longer to begin with, and homes in less desirable or unfavorable locations," said Jody Toth, a saleswoman at John P. Streb & Son in Tarrytown.
And some houses, because of quirky structural designs or poorly planned layouts, are simply hard to sell. Or, more likely, owners need to recoup what they paid for a property and will keep a house on the market until a suitable price is met. Whatever the reason, homeowners are sometimes forced to move, usually because of job relocation. In corporate relocations, owners are often bailed out by holding companies that purchase their homes, and in turn list the property with a real estate broker.
Because a vacant house or an unattended property can be a risk, the services of a house sitter are sometimes necessary, several real estate brokers agreed. Two businesses in Connecticut, incidentally, hire house sitters for their clients, who are typically realtors and financial holding companies. Show Homes of America, a Dallas-based company, has a branch office in Westport, and two partners, Mary Boehlert and Joanne Paone-Gill, have been operating Home Market Associates Inc. in Fairfield for five years.
Home Market Associates has 30 to 40 so-called residential managers placed at any given time, and because it is a small company, Ms. Paone-Gill said, "it provides a more personalized service in marketing the properties for the home owners."
Heather Hiltz, the placement manager and overseer of Show Homes of America's Westport office, said that a distinction exists between house sitters and home managers -- the people she contracts to furnish and decorate vacant properties. "Home sitters are either paid for their service or it's a trade-off -- the house is occupied, maintained and watched while the house sitter resides there for free," she said.
Both Home Marketing's residential managers and Show Homes's home mangers pay rents that are 60 percent to 75 percent less than the average rent for a comparable property. For instance, one manager occupied a contemporary mini-castle on a hill, which is listed at more than $1 million, for $1,000 a month plus utilities and the cost of lawn maintenance. Houses selling for $500,000 normally rent for between $600 and $750 a month plus utilities.
When Show Homes accepts a new listing, Susan Handee, an interior decorator, helps arrange the home manager's furnishings to create a model home atmosphere, which many realtors feel helps sell the property more quickly. Also, a Show Homes brochure says that with a home manager houses go for an average 10 to 15 percent higher selling price.
"The model home has to be kept in a pristine state," Ms. Hiltz said. "Looking at the pictures in the home-decorating magazines, if you don't see it in those photographs, then we don't want to see it in our show homes."
Dirty dishes left in the sink aren't tolerated, and the houses are subjected monthly to unannounced inspections, Ms. Hiltz said. "Home managing for us is like a part-time job," she said.
Most of Ms. Hiltz's home managers are saving money for a future house, and others are building houses and do not want to be locked into a lease. A few home managers are bankrupts or people unable to pass a credit check.
"I sold my house in Pound Ridge to raise capital for a business, and I was paying $40,000 a year in rent," said Dorothy Treyball, who started with Show Homes but works primarily with Home Marketing Associates.
"I was used to expensive homes, and it was going to be hard for me to move into an apartment," Ms. Treyball said. "I had too many nice things, and I didn't want to have to sell them. I saw a Show Homes ad in Greenwich Time, and it sounded almost too good to be true."
Obviously, there is an adverse side to house sitting: one year Ms. Treyball moved five times. "It's so much hard work packing and unpacking everything, even though I've gotten good at it," she said. "I really prefer at least six months in one location."
Most house sitters hope to be placed in a property that won't sell too quickly. "There is a bit of an art to picking out a house that you want to manage," said Remie Smith, who bounced from house to house with his wife and two preschool children while he renovated a house for his family.
Robert Svoboda, currently managing a property for Show Homes in Mamaroneck, said he probably wasn't going anywhere too soon because the split-level he is in "backs up to a boat yard." Also, across the street and in front of the house is the back wall of a garden apartment complex -- "not an attractive view," said Mr. Svoboda, who moved into the house last November.
Another trick, Mr. Smith said, is to rent storage space. "You don't want to move all of your possessions into a house," he said. "So, we never really moved into each house, and we never got comfortable. It was like camping out."
Midge Billingsley of Frances Billingsley Realty in Katonah said her firm does not hire house sitters. "If a house is priced correctly, we usually have an accepted offer within 30 days," she said. "So, the house will only be vacant for a total of three months, from offer to closing. Plus, any of the homes that are empty the realtors check every day."
Still, many realtors and absentee owners would rather hire a house sitter than face the anxiety associated with unattended property. Elio De Cecchis, whose Tarrytown concern De Cecchis Realty listed the English cottage that Robert Chamberlain is living in, said that the agreement Mr. Chamberlain has with the property's owner, a New York City real estate holding company, "can actually save owners and insurance companies a great deal of money."
Mr. Chamberlain kept the pipes from freezing when the electric ignition in the house's boiler malfunctioned in March.
Mr. Chamberlain is responsible for the heating costs, which will amount to more than $3,000 this year, and minor maintenance charges also come out of his pocket.
Mr. Chamberlain, a landscape architect at the Glen Gate Company in Wilton and president of the Tarrytown Historical Society, once moved three times in seven weeks, hopping between Greenwich and Somers.
"The transience used to bother me," he said. "But I've grown accustomed to it. I just call this my nomadic stage."

HEADLINE: A Winning Formula: Forget Timing, Forget Technology

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
RICHARD GLASEBROOK doesn't think much of market timers, the investment managers who try to predict the best moment to shift assets among stocks, bonds and cash. In his experience, "very few people are consistently successful at trying to pick the most attractive market over time."
Trouble is, that's exactly what Mr. Glasebrook is paid to do. As manager of the Quest for Value Opportunity fund, an asset allocation fund from Oppenheimer Capital of New York, his responsibility is to direct $408 million into whatever is currently the most attractive investment category. 
 So he goes with the long-term favorite. "It's clear that for most five-year periods since the Depression, stocks have outperformed" all other asset classes, Mr. Glasebrook said in a recent interview. "Given that history, especially if you invest for the long run, it makes sense to have most of your money in the most attractive asset class."
Stocks now account for 79 percent of the fund's portfolio. Bonds and convertible securities represent a mere 1 percent, with the balance -- roughly 20 percent -- in cash.
That split is consistant with Mr. Glasebrook's style; since he took over management of the fund in March 1991, stocks have accounted for at least 63 percent of assets, and bonds have never exceeded 15 percent.
"We don't try to predict which markets are attractive to be in and then buy a broad cross section," Mr. Glasebrook explained. "We have the advantage of offering clients the ability to be in equities when it's attractive, but also to preserve capital" by buying bonds or Treasury bills. Primarily, however, "we look for attractive businesses in the equity market that can grow capital at a good rate."
Hardly as effortless as he makes it sound, Mr. Glasebrook's record speaks volumes. Through Thursday, Quest for Value Opportunity A shares were up 23.2 percent for the year, double the average for similar funds. That gain, achieved without a big bet on the high-flying technology sector, placed it in the top 1 percent of the 4,175 mutual funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services, the fund researchers.
No flash in the pan, the fund posted an average annual gain of 19.3 percent over the last four years. The A shares carry a 5.5 percent sales charge, though B and C shares are available with different fee structures.
Just as it is not a typical asset allocation fund, Quest for Value Opportunity is not strictly a value fund, which its name implies. While Mr. Glasebrook certainly seeks stocks that are cheap relative to their peers, price-earnings ratios are far down on his list of qualifying criteria.
More important is a company's ability to generate cash, then plow it back into its business or repurchase its stock. "I want to own businesses that, because of their quality, are able to generate high amounts of cash over time," he said. "And I look for high barriers to entry," meaning new competitors would have trouble penetrating the market.
Few companies fit that bill. Typically, the fund holds only about 30 stocks, far fewer than the approximately 200 found in the average mutual fund. Just 10 stocks make up 45 percent of the Quest portfolio's value. Mr. Glasebrook said that plowing his assets into so few companies is not especially risky. "If I have a unique, informed opinion I can better appraise an opportunity," he said.
In fact, the strategy could be considered risk averse, said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical, "if the fund is careful in selecting its stocks."
The fund owns stocks that have lower-than-average valuations and greater-than-normal sales and earnings growth. While a downdraft in the equity market could be painful for the fund, Mr. Lipper said, "as I look at the names there, I don't think they'd have any trouble getting out of them."
The quest for value takes a slow, deliberate pace in the hands of Mr. Glasebrook, 47. He engages in lengthy discussions with company managers, poring over financial statements to help predict future returns. He invests as he speaks, in deliberate, measured amounts, and once he buys, he holds. Only about a third of the fund's portfolio is replaced each year.
Mr. Glasebrook's search for profitable investments inevitably leads him into unpopular corners of the market -- like military contracting. The fund's biggest investment is McDonnell Douglas, at 7.4 percent of assets, and it has paid off handsomely. The stock has gained nearly 50 percent this year.
"We thought the company's commercial business was undervalued," he said. "Although production of aircraft was coming down, we thought they could reduce costs faster than revenues fell."
The financial sector makes up the largest chunk of the fund's portfolio, and Mr. Glasebrook is fond of big banks, including Citicorp, Mellon and Wells Fargo. "One of the common threads that run through all of the financial companies we own is that they throw off a great deal of capital," he said.
Citicorp's management in particular, he said, has shown it can make wise use of excess cash, and he's made the company his second-largest holding, at 6.4 percent of fund assets. "This is a management team that through trial and tribulation learned the value of capital, and painfully rebuilt itself after having previously not learned the nature of risk," he said.
Unlike most of this year's other stellar performers among mutual funds, Quest Opportunity owns few technology stocks. The market's hottest sector, technology accounted for only about 7 percent of the fund's portfolio at the end of April, and most of that was in one stock -- computer chip maker Intel, at 5.5 percent of the fund.
"We added to Intel during the Pentium problem," Mr. Glasebrook said, when a bug clouded the prospects for its new microprocessor. "We thought the situation might be a blessing in disguise, that in the future customers would want to deal with a company that they knew would exhaustively test its products and that had a strong-enough balance sheet to withstand the financial costs of a recall." Intel, far more than its competitors, fit the bill.
Mr. Glasebrook also seeks companies that, because of broad distribution channels, are unlikely to attract a great deal of competition. A good example is the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the fund's fifth-largest holding, at 4.3 percent of assets.
"Freddie Mac basically has one competitor, Fannie Mae," or the Federal National Mortgage Association, Mr. Glasebrook said. "The barriers around both companies' businesses -- their enormous economies of scale and their low overhead -- make them unlikely to engage in destructive competition."
The one blemish on Mr. Glasebrook's record since he took over management of the fund came in 1993, when the fund's 8.21 percent total return lagged behind the Standard & Poor's 500 by 1.85 percentage points.
"Our largest position that year was Honeywell," he recalled, and the fund sold at a loss when a patent infringement suit sent the shares reeling.
"I have the flexibility to decrease my equity holdings when risks suggest I should," Mr. Glasebrook said, but when he does sell, the money is most likely to go into cash.
Unlike other asset allocation funds, whose bond holdings average 31 percent of the portfolio, Quest Opportunity avoids debt. If that makes the fund not a true asset allocation fund, he says, so be it. As Mr. Glasebrook's record shows, investors could do worse.
