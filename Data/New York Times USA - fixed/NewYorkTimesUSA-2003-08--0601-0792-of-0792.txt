HEADLINE: The Mortgage-Closing Nightmare 

 BODY:
Millions of Americans who have suffered through the agonies of refinancing an old mortgage or taking out a new one can only cheer the efforts of Mel Martinez, the secretary of housing and urban development, to simplify the process. The current system is so confusing and costly that it leaves many borrowers feeling gouged by a process from which they cannot escape.
 The nub of the problem concerns the closing, or settlement, costs, a bewildering blizzard of fees that can grow beyond a borrower's expectations. As the process works now, consumers choose mortgages based mostly on the interest rates. They have no sure way of judging the fees that are involved. 
 Early in the process the customer is given a "good faith" estimate of all the charges that will be imposed for the title search, title insurance, appraisal, survey and other items. The trouble is, that estimate is often wide of the mark. Some lending institutions low-ball the numbers, leaving borrowers to face nasty surprises when they have to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars more at their closings. Other lenders inflate the estimate so consumers will be relieved when the final bills are lower. Either way, the good-faith estimates are so squishy that borrowers cannot rely on them when shopping for the best mortgage. 
Last year, Mr. Martinez, treading into a minefield, proposed regulations that would constitute the most sweeping reform of the mortgage process in almost three decades. His agency estimates that the reforms, by spurring greater competition among lenders, could squeeze $8 billion to $10 billion a year from the $50 billion spent annually on closing costs, or more than $700 per loan transaction.
The most important reforms would give borrowers a much better idea up front of what the closing costs would be. The new rules would encourage lending institutions to offer borrowers "guaranteed mortgage packages" that would specify the interest rates and total settlement charges right at the start, an approach that is inhibited by current regulations. That would make it exquisitely easy for borrowers to compare one mortgage offer with another. Or lenders could offer borrowers itemized good-faith estimates that would have to be a whole lot firmer than today's estimates are. The lending institution would have to guarantee its own costs and hold the costs of other service providers within narrow limits.
Another important change would require the full disclosure of the fees that are paid by lending institutions to the mortgage brokers, who bring in most of their customers. All too often, these customers pay higher-than-normal interest rates for their loan, and the excess is used to help compensate the broker without the customer's knowledge.
The proposed reforms are generally supported by mortgage banks but stoutly resisted by title companies, mortgage brokers and other service providers, which fear that their profits will be squeezed.
We hope that Secretary Martinez will press ahead and soon issue final regulations along the lines of his original proposal. The opponents have lined up some allies in Congress who may try to block the reforms. They are casting the fight as a struggle between the big banks and smaller local business owners. That is beside the point. The party that needs protection is the borrower, not some mortgage broker or title company worried about full disclosure and the rigors of competition.

HEADLINE: Europe Reacts Coolly to Bush's Call to Freeze Charities' Assets 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
Europe has reacted tepidly to President Bush's call to freeze the assets of four European charities said by the administration to be sending cash to Palestinian militants. That sets the stage for another trans-Atlantic rift over Middle East policy.
 Rudolf Gollia, a spokesman for Austria's Interior Ministry, said the country's counterterrorism agency had already investigated one of the groups, the Palestinian Association in Austria, and had found no evidence of wrongdoing. "Under Austrian law there were no grounds for punitive action," Mr. Gollia told the Austria Press Agency late on Friday after Mr. Bush had spoken. 
 Both French and European Union officials said any decision on freezing assets would probably be made jointly by European foreign ministers over the next few weeks and would require a thorough review of the charities' activities.
"The European ministers and experts will look at the question and there will be a 15-country debate," a French diplomat said here today, adding that only then would there be a decision. The ministers are scheduled to meet in Italy on the first weekend in September.
Mr. Bush demanded Friday that the assets of five charities be frozen along with those of six top officials of Hamas, the Palestinian organization whose military wing has claimed responsibility for the deadly suicide attack on a Jerusalem bus on Tuesday.
Four of those organizations are based in Europe: the French-based Committee for Welfare and Relief for Palestine; the Palestinian Relief Association in Switzerland; the Palestinian Relief and Development Fund, or Interpal, with headquarters in Britain; and the Palestinian Association in Austria. The fifth charity, the Sanabil Association for Relief and Development, is based in Lebanon.
Mr. Bush's demand highlights a stark difference between how the United States and Europe, with its large and growing Muslim population, have dealt with Palestinian activists. Europe has resisted Bush administration requests that it blacklist Hamas's political wing, which many European leaders contend is a legitimate organization.
The administration's call for cooperation by "all nations supportive of peace in the Middle East" again casts Europe as a potential impediment to American foreign policy, as it was in the months ahead of the Iraq war. United States pressure on Europe to comply also risks reopening rifts within the 15-member European Union that yawned wide during the Iraq debate when some countries supported Washington and others did not.
The European Union has labeled Hamas's military wing a terrorist organization. But the question of freezing assets of the group's political wing, let alone those of charities that many Europeans consider vital to providing services to the Palestinian people, remains divisive. 
While individual European countries are free to bar organizations unilaterally, they have agreed to operate jointly. In part that is meant to improve efficiency -- with a common banking system, any freeze on assets in one European country could easily be sidestepped by transferring those assets to another -- but there is also the wish to maintain a unified Middle East policy. "Clearly it's an issue of foreign policy where the European Union wants to stay together," said Joost Korte, deputy chief of cabinet for Christopher Patten, the European commissioner for external affairs.
The charities themselves reacted angrily today, saying that they had no links to Hamas and that their funds were not diverted from humanitarian ends. 
Ibrahim Hewitt, the chairman of Interpal, said his organization was investigated for similar allegations in 1996 by Britain's Charity Commission, a regulatory body, and given a clean bill of health. Since then, he said, it has maintained close contacts with the commission and the local police. "I would hope that the government would go along with what their own civil servants advise," he said.
A spokesman for Britain's Foreign Office said today that any action against Interpal would be up to the Charity Commission.
Mr. Hewitt said he did not know how his group got on the United States blacklist. A recent Federal Bureau of Investigation report linked Interpal with an American-based charity whose assets the Bush administration froze in 2001 for supporting Hamas's military wing. But Mr. Hewitt said the only link was a $66,000 wire transfer from the United States charity to his group for providing meat from slaughtered sheep for religious feasts in the Middle East.
He said he had no knowledge of Hamas activists who the F.B.I. has charged are members of some charities to which his organization sends money. "We don't deal with individuals," he said. "We operate through charities over there that are registered with the Palestinian and Israeli authorities and we have a very bureaucratic paper trail to ensure that we know how the money is being spent."
He called on the United States to provide evidence that the named organizations were helping finance militant activities. "If we've done wrong, tell us and we'll correct it," he said.
Youcef Benderbal, spokesman for the Committee for Welfare and Relief for Palestine, said his organization was "shocked and revolted" to be associated with Hamas.
"I am amazed," he said, "that the president of a country such as the United States would mix things up like he did, and take it out against a humanitarian organization."

HEADLINE: FOLLOWING UP 

BYLINE:  By Joseph P. Fried

 BODY:
Bending the MetroCard, Breaking the Law
 The token suckers are gone. The MetroCard benders are here. 
 Once, there was the clatter of tokens being dumped into pails from turnstiles, to be returned to station booths and resold. Now, there is the litter of discarded MetroCards. 
The New York City transit system is completing its high-tech revolution in fare paying. The MetroCard, introduced in 1994, became the sole way to buy a subway ride in May, and it will become the only currency on buses on Jan. 1.
With the switch have come more sophisticated system-beating schemes. Before, thieves broke open turnstile boxes to steal tokens wholesale. Or they stole them one at a time by jamming turnstile slots with paper; after a deposited token became stuck and the frustrated passenger left, the culprit slipped in to suck the token out.
With MetroCards, fare filchers found that bending or folding a card in a certain place destroyed the data that deducted value when a ride was taken. While some benders used the extra rides for themselves, others "sold swipes" at a discount.
When turnstile reprogramming in 1998 ended that scheme, another bending ploy permitted one illicit extra ride on a discarded card.
Last week, a spokesman for New York City Transit said card benders were stealing an average of 500 rides on a weekday, worth $260,000 a year.
By contrast, the system lost $5 million last year to turnstile jumpers, illegal gate entrants and the like, transit officials say, though they are pleased that this compares with $70 million a year in fare and token thefts in the late 1980's.
Environmentally, discarded MetroCards are still "not a major problem in terms of bulk," the transit spokesman, Paul Fleuranges said, though his agency urges riders to refill cards rather than buy new ones.
There is an economic reason as well. A new card costs the agency 7 cents, he said, and an average of 14 million are sold per month. Only 3.5 million of those are refilled.
Yet the transit agency itself does not reuse cards discarded in the station receptacles meant for them and on the station floors not meant for them, he said. Why? The cost of retrieving cards "from all the possible discard locations," he said, "and then reprocessing them, would be prohibitive."

You Won't See the Open From Your Window Seat
In 1993, Mayor David N. Dinkins made a deal for expanding the National Tennis Center, site of the United States Open, in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens. Rudolph W. Giuliani, then about to succeed Mr. Dinkins, criticized the deal, especially a provision penalizing the city up to $325 million during each Open for excessive flyovers from nearby La Guardia Airport during play.
Mr. Giuliani argued that the city had no control over air traffic. Mr. Dinkins said the deal benefited the city's economy. This year's Open begins tomorrow.
Last week, the city's Parks and Recreation Department said the city had never had to pay a penalty. An assistant commissioner, Joanne Imohiosen, said the penalty threshold was six flyovers in any hour of play or 18 in a day.
The Federal Aviation Administration curbs flyovers by steps like changing the takeoff path from the runway nearest the tennis center, said Leo Prusak, the La Guardia tower's air-traffic manager.
Mr. Giuliani could not be reached for comment last week, a spokeswoman said. Mr. Dinkins said, "All I can figure is Rudy didn't like it because I did it."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 27, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Following Up column on Sunday misstated the amount of money that New York City could be required to pay as a penalty if there are excessive flyovers by planes from La Guardia Airport during the United States Open. It is up to $325,000, not $325 million.

HEADLINE: Schwarzenegger the Investor Relies on Expert Advice 

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON with GERALDINE FABRIKANT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
In the typical Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, the star almost always triumphs but not without averting a series of catastrophes. So far, it seems, that is not how Mr. Schwarzenegger, the candidate for governor, likes to manage his personal finances.
 State records and interviews with investment advisers indicate that Mr. Schwarzenegger appears to be tamer than his on-screen persona when it comes to his own money, amassing a fortune by cutting movie deals, buying real estate and taxable bonds and hiring money managers to handle investments. 
 His investments -- to the degree they were made public by the Fair Political Practices Commission this month -- do not reveal any unusual business sophistication. What they do show is that Mr. Schwarzenegger has relied on experts to advise him, something he has already done in his burgeoning political career by calling upon the investor Warren E. Buffett, whom friends say he depends on less for stock tips than economic advice. When he hired an investment manager in the mid-1990's, for instance, he turned to Paul Wachter, a former Wall Street banker. 
"He has always been realistic about what he knows and what he doesn't know," said Lou Pitt, the former talent agent who advised him on his movie career during his heyday in the 1980's and early 1990's.
Mr. Schwarzenegger declined a request to be interviewed about his finances. But since the mid-1990's, he has depended on Mr. Wachter, who said they met in 1981 when he was a law clerk in Los Angeles and worked with Bobby Shriver, the brother of Maria Shriver, who is now Mr. Schwarzenegger's wife. Mr. Wachter spent much of his career as an investment banker at Kidder Peabody and at what was then Schroder Wertheim & Company before starting Main Street Advisors in 1997. Mr. Schwarzenegger was his first client.
Mr. Wachter said Mr. Schwarzenegger's money was invested with more than 10 money managers who buy companies with consistent management and growth potential.
Mr. Schwarzenegger's portfolio consists of few high-fliers (his tax returns show he recently sold shares in the telecom firm Global Crossing for a loss) and is full of blue-chip stocks like Abbott Laboratories, Coca-Cola, Wal-Mart and General Electric. It was Mr. Schwarzenegger's idea to buy shares in Starbucks, Mr. Wachter said, although he rarely picks stocks.
Aside from the stocks, real estate and limited partnerships that Mr. Schwarzenegger was required to disclose as part of his bid for governor, Mr. Wachter said, the movie star also has a sizable portfolio in other investments, including income-producing bonds, and a lot of cash.
Because he was not required to disclose when he bought and sold his investments it is nearly impossible to know how much money Mr. Schwarzenegger has made, said money managers who have reviewed his state filings. Mr. Wachter declined to say how much Mr. Schwarzenegger was worth, but some in Hollywood suggested that his personal assets were valued at $200 million.
Mr. Schwarzenegger has also bought direct stakes in companies, including a privately owned Israeli company called Cell Guide Ltd., which develops software for cellular phones. In 1996, Mr. Schwarzenegger took a stake in Dimensional Fund Advisors, an investment management company in Santa Monica, Calif., and has several economics professors on its staff. 
Eugene Fama, the director of research at Dimensional and a professor of finance at the University of Chicago business school, was recently named one of Mr. Schwarzenegger's financial advisers.
No career, investing or otherwise, is without mistakes, and Mr. Schwarzenegger's is no exception. He was an investor in Planet Hollywood, receiving shares of stock in the restaurant chain in exchange for promotional appearances. It filed for bankruptcy in 1999. In the 1970's he bought two pieces of property in Hi Vista, Calif., because he thought an airport would be built there, advisers said. It never was. And his effort to revitalize a section of downtown Denver in the 1980's was thwarted; another developer stepped in.
It is in Hollywood that Mr. Schwarzenegger earned most of his wealth. Lou Pitt was his agent at International Creative Management until 1997 and helped to negotiate some of the actor's most lucrative deals. Mr. Schwarzenegger earns a minimum of $20 million per film, Hollywood agents said, and often more depending how big a hit the movie is. Even now, with his career not nearly as vibrant as it was a decade ago, he commands a star-worthy salary and perks. For "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," he earned about $30 million, two people involved in the production said.
But in Hollywood a paycheck can get complicated. Two people briefed on the financing of 1991's "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," executives for the now defunct Carolco Pictures, which produced the movie, agreed in lieu of pay to buy Mr. Schwarzenegger a Gulfstream 3 jet. One of these people said Carolco found the jet for Mr. Schwarzenegger and gave him the money to buy it.
Mr. Schwarzenegger then bought controlling shares in a Nevada company called G 3 Charter Corporation from Carolco, said the person, which chartered out the jet when Mr. Schwarzenegger was not using it. He sold the jet in 1998 for about $11 million, an airline broker said.
Mr. Wachter said Mr. Schwarzenegger's favorite investment was real estate. He has invested millions of dollars in a Santa Monica shopping plaza and a shopping mall in Ohio.
But he has also invested millions in his family's six-acre compound. According to the Assessor's Office for the County of Los Angeles, Mr. Schwarzenegger assembled four contiguous properties just off Sunset Boulevard in Pacific Palisades for a total of about $13 million. The properties are in a joint name: Mr. Schwarzenegger and his wife; the properties are said to be worth $16 million to $18 million.
Last year, Mr. Schwarzenegger and his wife also bought a nine-acre property in Brentwood, which had a 14,000-square-foot home with seven bedrooms and nine baths, according to data from the assessor's office.

HEADLINE: Prominent Republican Withdraws From California Race 

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
Bill Simon Jr., one of the best-known Republicans in the recall election for California governor, dropped out of the race today, saying that the defeat of Gov. Gray Davis was more important than his personal ambitions.
 Mr. Simon had come under intense pressure from fellow Republicans in recent days to withdraw from the contest to avoid splintering the Republican vote. Two other prominent Republicans, State Senator Tom McClintock and Peter V. Ueberroth, vowed today to stay in the race. 
 But with six weeks to go until the Oct. 7 recall vote, the contest to replace Mr. Davis -- should the recall succeed -- was quickly taking on the appearance of a two-man race between Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, a Democrat, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican.
Mr. Bustamante is the lone prominent Democrat on the ballot. While most Democratic officials are urging a "no" vote on the recall, they are also supporting Mr. Bustamante in case the recall question passes.
Under the convoluted rules governing the election, Mr. Simon's name will remain on the ballot, along with 134 other candidates. In his statement today, Mr. Simon did not endorse Mr. Schwarzenegger or any other candidate, but he urged voters to remove Mr. Davis from office.
"I strongly believe that the desire of Californians must come before the aspirations of any single candidate," he said. "There are too many Republicans in this race. And the people of our state simply cannot risk a continuation of the Gray Davis legacy."
In a brief statement, Mr. Schwarzenegger praised Mr. Simon for his decision. "I hope Bill's personal sacrifice will serve to unify Republicans and other Californians who are eager to join the movement to give California back its future," Mr. Schwarzenegger said. 
Mr. Simon's decision was based on cold-eyed political and financial calculations. He was badly trailing Mr. Schwarzenegger in polls and saw little prospect for gaining substantial support in the face of Mr. Schwarzenegger's celebrity and wealth.
A poll from the Public Policy Institute of California this week had Mr. Schwarzenegger at 23 percent, Mr. McClintock at 5 percent, and Mr. Simon and Mr. Ueberroth tied at 4 percent. Mr. Bustamante was supported by 18 percent. Mr. Simon and Mr. McClintock were competing for the votes of fiscal and social conservatives, many of whom have expressed reservations about Mr. Schwarzenegger's moderate views on abortion and gay rights.
In addition, Mr. Simon has millions of dollars of debt from his unsuccessful campaign for governor last fall and apparently did not want to risk any more of his fortune. He lost to Mr. Davis in a close race last November, but the contest was seen more as a referendum on the unpopular Mr. Davis than as a vote of confidence in Mr. Simon, who ran a fairly inept campaign in his first try for elective office.
K. B. Forbes, Mr. Simon's chief spokesman, denied that Mr. Simon had backed out because of pressure from party officials or major donors.
But on Friday, the Lincoln Club of Orange County, a group of wealthy conservative Republicans, unanimously endorsed Mr. Schwarzenegger and urged Mr. Simon, Senator McClintock and Mr. Ueberroth to step aside. Also on Friday, the Republican leader of the State Senate, Jim Brulte, warned that there were too many Republicans in the race and that some would have to drop out to avoid handing victory to Mr. Davis or Mr. Bustamante.
Mr. Forbes said that Mr. Simon had raised less than $500,000 to finance his committee, a fraction of what it would cost to mount a credible statewide campaign. Unlike last fall's race, when he invested several million dollars, Mr. Simon had not put any of his own money into this race, Mr. Forbes said. Mr. Simon, who lives in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles, is a businessman and son of William E. Simon, the former treasury secretary. 
Mr. McClintock was attending a Republican gathering in Placer County in Northern California today and has a full schedule of appearances in coming days, his deputy campaign manager, John Stoos, said.
"This is one horse who's in the race to stay," Mr. Stoos said, and then took a shot at Mr. Schwarzenegger. "What Senator McClintock has been saying is that if every time a qualified candidate had to step aside when a rich person or a celebrity wanted to run for public office, our nation would be run by nothing but millionaires and celebrities."
Dan Schnur, Mr. Ueberroth's campaign manager, said the candidate would remain in the race and felt no pressure to withdraw. He also said the campaign would begin radio advertising in the coming week. 
Mr. Ueberroth, chairman of the Olympic Games in Los Angeles in 1984 and former commissioner of Major League Baseball, is running a low-key campaign based on proposals to repair the state budget and revive the California economy.
John J. Pitney, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, said that Mr. Simon's withdrawal was a step toward unifying Republicans behind Mr. Schwarzenegger.
"It's going to come down to the Terminator versus Davis and Bustamante," he said. He added that Mr. McClintock and Mr. Ueberroth would come under increasing pressure to defer to Mr. Schwarzenegger.
"Realistically, neither of them is going to be the governor. And neither of them wants to go down as the Republican who helped the Democrats hold on to the governor's chair," he said. "It's better to be seen as a savior than a spoiler."

HEADLINE: Flying Again 

BYLINE:  By PHILLIP LUTZ

 BODY:
A DECADE ago, with military spending declining and a recession in full force, Grumman began slashing a workforce that once topped 25,000, making it the largest private-sector employer on Long Island. Then, Northrop bought Grumman and moved most of the aerospace company's operations to Southern California and elsewhere. That nearly ended the Island's long tradition as a center for defense manufacturing, and lent new urgency to local planners' calls for economic diversification. 
 Now, a big new contract will boost Northrop Grumman's Long Island payroll by nearly 50 percent, still under 3,000 but enough to place the company among the top 15 private employers on the Island. The mantra of economic diversification has been all but drowned out by the clamor to rebuild the local contribution to the military-industrial complex. 
 Under the contract, announced this month, Northrop Grumman will receive $1.9 billion to upgrade the Navy's E-2C Hawkeye radar plane and airborne command post. By the time hiring for the project is completed at the end of 2004, the company will have added 800 jobs in Bethpage, its heaviest hiring since the the 1980's, said Philip A. Teel, Northrop Grumman's vice president for airborne early warning and electronic warfare systems. 
The contract will help raise Long Island's defense profile in Washington after attention and jobs had shifted south and west, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said. "The quality of the work and the intellectual capital had certainly remained high," she said of Long Island's military contractors, but "when thinking about the defense industry, Long Island was no longer on the tip of anybody's tongue."
Senator Clinton, a Democrat in a Republican-controlled Washington but one with a seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the new hiring will help "begin the process of moving Long Island defense firms into competitive positions again."
Representative Steve Israel of Huntington said the contract was "a giant leap in returning Long Island as the capital of America's defense industry." Mr. Israel, also a Democrat but also sitting on his house's armed services committee, has emerged as a leader in efforts to rebuild the Island's defense industry in the post-9/11 era, developing the high-tech tools of 21st-century warfare and domestic security. "That, I think, is the future of Long Island's economy," he said. "And the Hawkeye contract gives us a nice solid base to build on."
No one is predicting a return to the glory days of military contracting on the Island, when manufacturers like Grumman and Republic turned out craft ranging from the P-47 fighter plane to the Apollo lunar module. Big-time aircraft manufacturing is gone forever from the Island; a water tower now sprouts from the runway at Northrop Grumman's Bethpage plant, and its Calverton plant now belongs to the Town of Riverhead. But the design and manufacture of the sophisticated components that are installed inside the military aircraft "platform" are still well within the repertory of Long Island's high-tech workforce, and the trend of declining employment in the local defense sector has taken a decided turn. 
Employment in Northrop Grumman's airborne early warning and electronic warfare division in Bethpage, where design work on the advanced Hawkeye is being done, declined from 2,524 in December 1998 to 1,605 in December 2001, according to the Defense Contract Management Agency, which monitors military contractors for the Department of Defense. 
But as of June 2003, that number had grown to 1,798. Northrop Grumman, which has already hired about 200 people to work on the Hawkeye in Bethpage, expects to hire another 200 workers this year and 400 next year to work on the program, Mr. Teel said. 
Overall defense sector employment on the Island has increased as well. The state Department of Labor reports that 80,566 people worked in the sector at its peak in 1986. By the third quarter of 2001, that number had declined to 26,015. But in the fourth quarter of that year, the latest quarter for which figures are available, the number had increased to 27,223. Since then, the number has risen by about 2,000, according to estimates by Yacov Shamash, the dean of engineering and applied sciences at Stony Brook University. 
Department of Defense statistics show contract awards to defense companies in Nassau and Suffolk declining from $3.9 billion in 1990 to $1 billion in 2001, the last year for which figures are available. Since then, Dr. Shamash estimated, "well over $2 billion" has been awarded to firms on the Island. The $1.9 billion for Northrop Grumman's new contract alone would make this year the biggest since 1993, when the Island's defense companies took in $2.2 billion.
Grumman's involvement with the Hawkeye dates from the 1960's, when it built the earliest version of the carrier-based plane. Although the Hawkeye's basic look has changed little since then -- it remains a propeller craft with a distinctively stubby body topped by a huge radar dish -- the plane's avionics have undergone at least five upgrades. 
The new upgrade represents a "major modification" of the Hawkeye 2000, the version of the plane now in production, Mr. Teel said. The advanced Hawkeye will have a new radar system that can detect missiles as well as aircraft over land and water with greater range and precision. The fuselage will be enlarged and the cockpit reconfigured. 
The first planes, scheduled for delivery in 2011, will come from Northrop Grumman's St. Augustine plant. But much of the design work will be done at the company's new Cyber Warfare Integration laboratory, which is set to be unveiled at a "technology day" on Sept. 8 at the Bethpage plant. Some 250 C.E.O.'s and others are scheduled to gather to discuss strategy for cooperating to win contracts from the Defense and Homeland Security departments. 
The consensus is that homeland security, as much as traditional defense, is where Long Island's future lies. "We have a lot to offer in this new security environment, not only in the defense budget but in homeland security," Mrs. Clinton said.
Of the $1.9 billion approved for this phase of the Hawkeye's development, Northrop Grumman's Bethpage operations will receive 55 percent, or slightly more than $1 billion, according to Department of Defense figures.
One of the lead subcontractors is BAE Systems in Greenlawn, which will help develop the "identification friend or foe" system for the advanced Hawkeye. The system helps determine the intentions of aircraft through an electronic question-and-answer system. 
Patricia McMahon, the vice president for electronic identification and display systems at BAE, said she expected the new contract to be finalized by Oct. 1. It is only one of a number of projects BAE is working on. The company, which employs about 1,100 people in Greenlawn, has added nearly 100 workers over the past year, and expects to hire another 100 or 150 over the next two years, she said.
"The industry is coming back," she said.
BAE is the only Long Island company among the lead subcontractors. But more opportunities for local companies will arise over the next six to eight months, when secondary subcontractors are chosen.
Welding Metallurgy is typical of the subcontractors who supply the Island's major defense companies. In business since 1979, the West Babylon company is an "integrated assembler," buying parts from other companies and putting them together into larger parts, like escape hatches and fuel lines. 
Welding Metallurgy depends on defense companies for most of its work, so the declinein military spending in the 1990's had a major impact on business, said John Gantt, the company's chief executive officer. But "now it's starting to come back," he said, adding that the new Northrop Grumman contract "certainly will open a lot of doors." 
Mr. Gantt said that his company's slice of the advanced Hawkeye pie might go as high as $8 million, and that his workforce might triple, to 120. To make room, the company is scheduled to move into a 25,000-square-foot building in Wyandanch in March, more than doubling the space it occupies. 
The deal "sets a positive economic climate for Long Island," said Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board. "The history of Grumman has been that as they create jobs, they create secondary jobs in terms of their subcontractors." 
Mr. Teel said it was too early to say how many subcontractors would be used or where they would be from. But company records show that 98 Long Island companies work on aspects of the Hawkeye 2000 directly related to its development and construction. The new contract could have a "tremendous effect" on Long Island's 1,500 or so information technology companies, said Peter Goldsmith, president of the Long Island Software and Technology Network, which promotes such companies. In-house sessions Grumman once held with small technology companies had "sort of evaporated," he said. "But now that it's going in the other direction, there's going to be a lot of business on Long Island at a very high level. I can't see Long Island businesses not meeting those challenges, ramping up and serving those needs."
The contract could generate interest off the Island, Mrs. Clinton said. "The more people who are attracted to Long Island because we have this advanced, highly technical work to be done, the more people will think of Long Island as a place to do that kind of work. It really is reinforcing. The hundreds of jobs that are going to be created in the next year because of this contract I believe will foster other private-sector and public-sector jobs that will be attractive simply because Northrop Grumman got this big contract." 
Gary Huth, an analyst with the state Department of Labor, agreed. "Opportunities become a magnet," he said. "By that I mean not just the number of jobs available, but when a region becomes a place other people want to be at because that's where the action is happening."
Mr. Israel said that the Hawkeye contract could act as a "linchpin in marketing Long Island as a capital of technology, not just for the Navy but also for homeland security, biotechnology and, in general, in the military's transformation." But he warned that the effort begun in the late 1980's to diversify the local economy must not be abandoned. 
Mr. Teel said that hiring was on schedule, but that while the largest percentage of candidates were from Long Island, Northrop Grumman was having to draw from other parts of the country to fill its staffing needs, and that a lack of suitable housing was a "major issue." He said he was hoping that municipalities would show "flexibility" on local zoning ordinances, most of which restrict multiunit housing. 
Mr. Israel said he would introduce legislation in Congress next month that would provide tax credits and incentives for developers to build entry-level housing on the Island as a "defense production capacity issue." He said the proposal would also call for down-payment assistance for first-time home buyers, grants to localities to streamline workforce housing programs and federal investment in the construction of workforce housing. 
Despite his concern about housing, Mr. Teel gave no indication that Northrop Grumman would be deterred from taking on more major projects. In the next six to eight months, Mr. Teel said, he anticipates receiving a contract for at least $500 million to develop the EA-18, the replacement for the EA-6B Prowler, the Navy's electronic attack aircraft. The EA-18, a variant of an existing fighter-bomber, would have improved surveillance and jamming capabilities. And another big project may be in the works, one in the maritime surveillance arena. Northrop Grumman is proposing that the Navy replace some of its manned P-3 surveillance aircraft with the Global Hawk, an unmanned vehicle. "This one is a little further out," Mr. Teel said. "But it's another one I feel bullish about."

To the Sports Editor:
 In the Associated Press article in The Times on Aug. 2 about the Pan American Games held in Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic was described as one of the poorest nations in the Americas. 
 In fact, the Dominican Republic is one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America. The Dominican Republic is also one of the few countries in the region that has been able to enjoy a long, healthy democratic process without interruptions for the past 38 years. 
 We are a proud nation and do not hide it; a smile is the trait that best describes a Dominican. Regarding poverty, this is a concern that has been seriously addressed by this -- as well as past -- governments. 
 Thus, the Dominican Republic made a great effort to celebrate the Pan American Games in our country for the enjoyment of all those involved.

HEADLINE: On the Way: A Bumper Crop 

BYLINE:  By CHERYL JENSEN

 BODY:
AMERICANS bought 38,000 gas-electric hybrid vehicles last year, and sales are likely to reach 54,000 in 2003, according to a recent study by J.D. Power & Associates, the big market-research firm. 
 That is only the beginning, if J.D. Power's predictions pan out: the firm expects 500,000 annual hybrid sales by 2008 and 872,000 by 2013. Since only three hybrid cars are currently available, reaching those lofty figures will require new varieties of hybrids -- and they are certainly on the way. 
 In 1999, America's first hybrid, the Honda Insight, went on sale. The Toyota Prius made its United States debut the next year (although it had been on sale in Japan since 1997), and the Honda Civic Hybrid followed in 2002. 
"The Japanese, at least Honda and Toyota, have already put their second-generation vehicles on the road," said David Friedman, senior engineer with the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group. "The Big Three haven't even put out their first hybrid."
Walter McManus, executive director of Global Forecasting at J.D. Power, said hybrid sales had been limited so far because the technology had been used only in compact cars. J.D. Power found that consumers would prefer hybrids comparable to vehicles they already own. Sport utility owners, for example, want hybrid S.U.V.'s.
"That's about to change, and when it does we'll see sales increase dramatically," Mr. McManus said, adding that by 2005, trucks may account for 39 percent of hybrid sales. New choices will come late next year, when the Ford Escape HEV and a hybrid version of the Lexus RX330 go on sale. When Ford first announced the Escape hybrid, the on-sale date was 2003.
These vehicles will be joined by full-size hybrid pickups from General Motors. Mr. Friedman said his group considered those trucks "half hearted" hybrids, since much of their fuel savings will come from conventional technology like a starter motor that shuts off the engine when the vehicle stops.
"Honda and Toyota vehicles exemplify what you can do with hybrid technology, and the Ford Escape and Saturn Vue will likely do that as well," he said. "The other G.M. vehicles will have improved fuel economy, and that's a good thing, but they fall far short of where hybrid technology can take you."
Here is a list of hybrid vehicles that have been announced for sale, based on information from automakers and the Union of Concerned Scientists:

FORD MOTOR COMPANY: Escape HEV (compact sport utility), available late summer 2004; Futura (midsize sedan), available in 2005. Canceled: Hybrid version of Explorer (midsize sport utility).

GENERAL MOTORS: 2005 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra (full-size pickup trucks); available late fall 2004; 2006 Saturn Vue (compact utility wagon); available late 2005; 2007 Chevrolet Equinox (compact sport utility), July 2006; 2008 Chevrolet Malibu (midsize sedan), January 2007; 2008 Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon (full-size sport utilities), to start production in 2007.

DAIMLERCHRYSLER: Dodge Ram Contractor Special (full-size pickup, based on Dodge Ram 2500 Quad Cab), due in late 2004. Indefinitely postponed: Dodge Durango TTR (full-size sport utility).

TOYOTA: Lexus RX400H (luxury utility wagon), on sale fall 2004; Highlander (midsize utility wagon) expected to follow the RX by a few months.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 31, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Automobiles section last Sunday about the future of hybrid gasoline-electric cars misstated Ford's plans for a hybrid version of the Futura, a new sedan. Although a conventional gasoline-powered Futura is scheduled to go on sale in 2005, Ford has not announced when the hybrid version will be offered.

An Orthodox Version of the Hamptons

BYLINE:  By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
 WHEN Joseph Lieberman, the presidential candidate and senator from Connecticut, and his wife, Hadassah, spent a recent Sabbath at the Hampton Synagogue in Westhampton Beach, he asked Marc Schneier, the congregation's founding rabbi, the secret to the synagogue's success. 
 Only half-jokingly, Rabbi Schneier summed up the reason for the overflow crowd in three words: "Kiddush to follow."
 More than 900 congregants swarmed upon the lavish smorgasbord set out on umbrella-shaded tables on the synagogue's expansive terrace after services on a recent Saturday. "People do come for the service but the kiddush is very much a highlight, in terms of the abundance of food and the social occasion," said Rabbi Schneier, an 18th-generation rabbi with a flair for showmanship. "You never know who you will meet on the patio. Its the whole social mystique of the Hamptons." 
 Though it competes against parties, pools, tennis, golf, boating and the beaches, the synagogue's popularity has grown so rapidly in the last few years that the 350- seat sanctuary is far from adequate. Doors on the north and south wings of the building open to tents and extra seating on the lawn and patio; services are standing room only from May through the High Holy Days.The synagogue has had a marked effect on Westhampton Beach. The congregation includes 500 families, and many nonmembers show up on summer weekends. A fund-raiser dinner on Wednesday is expected to raise at least $1.2 million. Scores of observant Jews have forked over sums in the high six and seven figures for homes close enough to enjoy the beach and be able to walk to their house of worship. Many locals agree that the synagogue has revitalized Westhampton Beach. But with plans to build a 25,000-square-foot childrens center on property the synagogue owns across the road from the main Sunset Avenue compound, and the recent acquisition of the Hamptons Arts Cinema by Harvey Kaylie, a congregant working in concert with the synagogue, rumors that the religious institution is taking over the village have swirled.
 "There is no question there is anti-Semitism in the world," said Peter Kaplan, owner of the Grassmere Inn, a local hotel. "To think there isn't in Westhampton Beach is foolish. Anytime a piece of real estategoes on the market, they think it's the temple."
 After the synagogue's cantor, Israel Rand, got married to Anat Eilon on Aug. 13 in a ceremony at the public Rogers Beach to which the congregation was invited, the gossip was so rampant that the rabbi lightly addressed it in his sermon last Saturday.
 "There is one rumor I must dispel: There is absolutely no basis that the Hampton Synagogue bought the beach," Rabbi Schneier said.
 The synagogue uses the movie theater, one block away on Brook Road, for a Jewish film series. On a recent Monday evening, 500 people showed up to see "Purity," a provocative film about the ancient laws and rituals for observant Jewish women, and a discussion with Ruth Westheimer, the sex therapist. On Sunday mornings, the cinema is used for a children's Jewish film festival; commercial films are shown the rest of the week.
 "The truth be told, we saved that movie theater," Rabbi Schneier said. The gossip enraged him.
 "For some people the rumor wasn't, 'Oh, did you hear the synagogue bought the theater,' " Rabbi Schneier said, "the rumor was, 'The synagogue bought the theater and they are turning it into a yeshiva.' " He recalled that others incorrectly surmised that the synagogue had also bought an empty food shop for parking for a supposed yeshiva.
 "I found those comments to be vulgar, to be offensive and to be nasty," Rabbi Schneier said.
 Mr. Kaylie, an electronics manufacturer from Brooklyn, said buying the cinema for the film series enhanced and broadened the synagogue's point of view. Admission is free and open to the public.
 "It is certainly not a ghetto within the Westhampton Beach town," Mr. Kaylie said. Its not separate. "It's part of the whole town. It injected a cultural, intellectual life into Westhampton Beach, not only during the summer but during the year."
 Rabbi Schneier claimed the synagogue was the driving force that changed Westhampton Beach from being overrun by share houses to a family-oriented community. "This village was headed to Potters Field," Rabbi Schneier said.
Hank Beck, president of the Westhampton Greater Chamber of Commerce, said the Orthodox "have been a stabilizing influence," and Len Conway, president of the board of the Westhampton Beach Performing Arts Center, said the synagogue was "a significant plus for our community," recalling that when the village's reputation was sagging in the mid-1990's, Rabbi Schneier led the Westhampton Beach Partnership to boost the village's image and restore economic and cultural vitality.
 Unlike the growth of Orthodox communities in other parts of the Island, Rabbi Schneier said his surging membership has not been at odds with the neighborhood.
 "You don't have the tensions you have in the Five Towns or in Great Neck," Rabbi Schneier said. "You may have underlying resentment but on the political level, we have really come together in terms of redefining and revitalizing Westhampton Beach."
 "It's been done in a very sensitive manner," he added. "It's not been done obnoxiously."
 Not everyone agrees. Some locals interviewed for this article, while insisting that they not be identified, pointed a finger at the synagogue and echoed the theme that "they" are buying up all the property.
 "I think people are a little nervous that the synagogue is taking over the town," said Elaine Schickman, the synagogue administrator. "It isn't."
 But it has had a significant effect on real estate values.
 "They have a two-mile walking distance and anything that is in that distance, the prices have increased tremendously," said Ginger Andrews, owner of First Hampton Realty on Main Street. "It's very desirable, any home that is walking distance to the synagogue."
 Prices for homes near the temple are up at least 45 percent in the last two to three years, Ms. Andrews said, starting at $800,000 and stretching into the millions, including a small stretch of oceanfront property on Dune Road.
 When Rabbi Schneier, 44, of Manhattan, first tried to open a synagogue in Westhampton Beach 13 years ago, he contacted area families and tried to assemble a minyan, the quorum of 10 Jewish men for a prayer service, but the village issued an injunction to try to close down the meetings in his home, saying a house of worship could not convene there because of fire laws and zoning codes. A legal skirmish for worship rights followed. Rabbi Schneier prevailed in State Appellate Court. Regular services began in his home in 1990. The synagogue was dedicated in 1994.
 Though its Orthodox orientation accommodates and draws the religiously observant, the Hampton Synagogue has an eclectic following.
 "I'm the rabbi of an Orthodox synagogue with a Conservative congregation and a Reform membership," Rabbi Schneier said.
 Mr. Kaylie said even non-observant Jews like himself were made to feel welcome.
 "If there were more synagogues like this one, and more rabbis like Schneier, assimilation would be dead," Mr. Kaylie said. "You don't have to be a Black Hat. You don't have to be religious to enjoy the services."
 Because the large crowd makes it impossible for worshippers to hear the services, this summer the rabbi discussed with rabbinical authorities like Shlomo Riskin, Chief Rabbi of Efrat, Israel, the installation of a transistorized Israeli-made Zomet microphone that doesnt violate Jewish law. It is the first in an Orthodox congregation on the Island. Microphones are usually not permitted because of a prohibition against the use of fire -- or an electrical current -- on the Sabbath.
 "Either you are an enlightened Orthodox Jew or you won't feel comfortable out here," Rabbi Schneier said.
 With the growth of the synagogue has come an increase in the shops and services catering to it. Laura Kremin, a year-round resident, has started Hamptonskosher.com, offering delivery of kosher meals on the East End and kosher catering at the Atlantica in Westhampton Beach, the Southampton Inn and Gurney's Inn in Montauk.
 Joey Allaham, who owns the Prime Grill, a top-rated Manhattan kosher steakhouse, opened a satellite restaurant within walking distance of the temple on Memorial Day weekend.
 "The way the Hamptons is growing with the Jews and the synagogue, they need a good restaurant," said Mr. Allaham, who offers Sabbath dinners and lunches for which the observant prepay, skirting the prohibition on handling money during the Sabbath. 
 For observant Jews who want to spend Saturday afternoons at the beach but are prohibited from handling money or carrying on the Sabbath, Mr. Kaplan arranges for the beach passes for his guests to be carried and for fees to be prepaid.
 Simon Jorna, 38, has owned the Beach Bakery Cafe on Main Street for 16 years. About five years ago, he began selling his pastries and pizza under stricter kosher guidelines.
 "The synagogue would not have been able to expand this fast without a kosher place in town serving them," Mr. Jorna said. "On the other side, we kept expanding because the synagogue grew."
 Mr. Jorna said he bakes up to 130 loaves of challah, the l bread served on Friday nights, each week. Next year he plans to double the size of his operation to 4,300 square feet. "The Jewish people are here now," said Mr. Jorna, who is Catholic.
 Even so, Mr. Jorna is not hoping for a larger kosher clientele.
 In the past few years, the explosion in the number of Jewish families is "up to a level that I say now we have to be careful we dont get too much," Mr. Jorna said. If Westhampton Beach became strictly Orthodox, like some villages he has seen in the Catskills, Mr. Jorna said, he would stop being kosher.
 "I like having everything mixed," Mr. Jorna said. "I like Catholics. I like Jews. I like gays. I like straight people. I like a little bit of everything. If we have too many of one its not good."
 Before getting ready to go to the synagogue on a recent Friday, Aaron and David Solomon, brothers from Queens, sat at a table at the Beach Bakery Cafe. It was their first visit to Westhampton Beach. Without an Orthodox synagogue, they would have been unable to spend the Sabbath in the village.
 "We wanted to come out here because we heard about the Hampton Synagogue and wanted to experience it for ourselves," said Aaron, an Internet marketing manager, looking forward to a change from Catskills vacations.
 "The great thing about coming here is you have the beach, you have the vacation spot," he said. "Everything is all encompassing: you have the kosher restaurant, you have the services. In that respect, its a very nice situation."

BYLINE:  By Lou Cannon; Lou Cannon is author of five biographies of Ronald Reagan, including the forthcoming "Governor Reagan: His Rise to Power."

DATELINE: SUMMERLAND, Calif. 

 BODY:
Gray Davis, the Democratic governor of California, may well become only the second governor in the nation's history to be recalled, but the election that removes him may well be a lose-lose-lose proposition for the state's Republican Party.
 There are several ways the Oct. 7 vote could set back the Republicans. The least probable is for the detested Mr. Davis to beat the recall. The party would also lose if Mr. Davis is replaced by another Democrat, most likely Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who is running just behind the Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger in the polls. 
 But given the state's fiscal situation, and the tough medicine needed to rectify it, the Republicans could also lose by winning. Based on current budget assumptions, California faces an $8 billion shortfall next year -- and even that figure seems ludicrously optimistic. The budget was cobbled together by a combination of rosy economic estimates and a series of fee increases, payment deferrals and borrowings that dropped California's credit rating into the cellar. 
This wealthy state, with a budget larger than all but five countries, is now less credit-worthy in the eyes of Wall Street than Mississippi. No matter who wins, restoring the state to fiscal health will require painful measures -- reductions in social services, increases in higher-education tuition and new taxes. In the end, the recall election looks like a trap: whoever ends up governor could quickly end up as unpopular as Mr. Davis is now. And no matter who wins, there will be another gubernatorial race in 2006.
Should a Republican win, then what next? Probably he would do what California Republicans always do in a crisis: look to their icon, Ronald Reagan. However, this time it should be the actual Governor Reagan, not the mythical creature California's conservatives have constructed over three decades. The party has for too long lived in denial of Mr. Reagan's pragmatic, centrist record in Sacramento. And the consequences of this approach are evident.
The state's Democrats, despite Mr. Davis, remain in an overhelmingly strong position. Senator Barbara Boxer is favored to be re-elected in 2004, and her fellow Democrat in the Senate, Dianne Feinstein, is the most popular politician in the state. Democrats have a deep bench of promising gubernatorial candidates for 2006, starting with Attorney General William Lockyer. Republicans hold no statewide office and lack a recognizable leader.
This is a startling turnabout for a state that was once a reliable Republican bastion. In the century before Mr. Davis took office, only three Democrats had served as governor. Beginning in 1952, Republican presidential candidates carried California in all but one election for four decades. This all changed in 1992, when Bill Clinton routed President George H. W. Bush in California. In the two subsequent presidential elections President Clinton and Al Gore carried the state handily. Mr. Davis was elected governor in 1998 and re-elected last year despite his unpopularity.
The Republican decline is often blamed on demographics. After the aerospace-industry implosion triggered a prolonged recession in the early 1990's, many middle-class whites fled California (in the process transforming neighboring Nevada from a Democratic to a Republican state). Meanwhile, Latinos registered in record numbers, spurred by a 1992 initiative that denied educational and medical benefits to illegal immigrants.
Demographics in themselves, however, do not account for the plight of the California G.O.P. Traditionally, recurrent defeats encourage political parties to become more inclusive. The state's Republican Party, however, remains firmly in the hands of social conservatives who have set themselves against the majority of Californians, who favor liberalized abortion laws, legalized marijuana and gay rights. Republican leaders have marginalized party moderates, like the former Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan, who agree with any of these positions.
The touchstone issue on which California Republicans solidly reflect voter sentiment is in their opposition to tax increases, a position they see as Ronald Reagan's legacy. Yes, Mr. Reagan was elected governor in 1966 after promising to "squeeze, cut, and trim" the budget, and he made some trims, to be sure. But he balanced the deficit he had inherited the old-fashioned way -- by raising taxes. 
In the first week of his governorship Mr. Reagan proposed a $1 billion tax increase, then the largest tax hike ever sponsored by any governor of any state. It was a relatively progressive proposal, too, imposing higher rate increases on banks and corporations than on individuals. The Reagan tax increase was equivalent to $5.3 billion in 2003 dollars. This year Republicans in the legislature unanimously opposed a Democratic proposal for a half-cent sales tax increase that would have raised at most $2 billion.
In addition, Governor Reagan signed a permissive abortion-rights bill that was supported by most Republican legislators. Subsequent Republican governors were similarly pragmatic. Gov. George Deukmejian defied the National Rifle Association after the Stockton schoolyard shooting and in 1989 signed legislation limiting assault weapons. Pete Wilson, confronted with a growing deficit in 1991, his first year in office, followed the Reagan example and proposed a budget that combined spending cuts with tax hikes. Republican legislators grumbled at the tax increases and Democrats at the cuts, but they passed the budget and solved a fiscal crisis.
Today California faces a more serious fiscal crisisthan in the Reagan or the Wilson years. This is partly the fault of Mr. Davis, who based his budget estimates on the fool's gold of the dot-com boom. Deeply in political debt to unions representing prison guards and other public employees, he made no effort to reduce state payrolls. Bill Simon, the Republican who lost to Mr. Davis in the 2002 election and who pulled out of the recall race yesterday, has a point when he says that the governor misrepresented California's fiscal situation during his re-election campaign.
But State Senator Tom McClintock, the remaining avowed Republican conservative now seeking the governorship, is even less realistic than Mr. Davis. He resolutely opposes any tax increases in 2004 despite growing evidence that even draconian budget cuts will fail to solve California's fiscal crisis. Peter Ueberroth, another serious Republican candidate, is less dogmatic but also unwilling to acknowledge the need for new taxes. His panacea is a one-time amnesty on penalties for those who owe back taxes, which he claims would raise $6 billion.
Mr. Bustamente, at least, acknowledges that new taxes are necessary. But his proposal to raise commercial property taxes, which might accelerate the business flight from California, would require a vote of the people to change Proposition 13, the 1978 measure that slashed property taxes and has become the third rail of California politics. That isn't going to happen. 
In this milieu, and in this field, Arnold Schwarzenegger is the only candidate with the potential to be realistic about California's financial situation. He isn't tied into Republican antitax ideology or beholden to the unions like the Democrats. Things seemed promising when the financial wizard Warren Buffett, a fiscal adviser to Mr. Schwarzenegger, said some higher taxes were necessary. The candidate himself sent out mixed signals at his press conference on Wednesday, saying that "additional taxes are the last burden we need" but, significantly, declining to pledge that he would never sign a budget including a tax increase. 
Mr. Schwarzenegger is no Ronald Reagan, who had a political track record when he ran for governor in 1966. He may fail to survive the media scrutiny in the six weeks before the election, and he may lose votes on the right to Mr. McClintock and on the left to Mr. Bustamante. But the actor supports abortion rights and gay rights -- and thus is the Republican best suited to play to the vital center. 
This may be enough to send him to Sacramento. If so, he should look to the Reagan example of a balanced solution -- higher taxes and budget cuts -- which could rescue California and its out-of-touch Republican Party. Otherwise, a victory at the polls may mean only a short stay in Sacramento, and a quick return to the Democratic status quo.

How much can the Department of Homeland Security do about cyberattacks?

BYLINE:  By David Strom; David Strom is the technology editor at VARBusiness magazine and author of "Home Networking Survival Guide" (McGraw-Hill Osborne, 2001). E-mail: dstrom@cmp.com.

 BODY:
CAN Tom Ridge keep the homeland safe for Internet surfing? 
 I started wondering last week after I got a call from a woman I did not know. She claimed my computer was sending hers a bunch of virus-infected messages. I did not do it -- honest. 
 It was all one big head fake, by some anonymous software writer out in cyberspace, whose malicious code was worming its way through countless PC's on the Internet. The virus, called SoBig.F, used e-mail address books to propagate itself, disseminating messages labeled "thanks" or "wicked screensavers" to randomly selected addresses. On Friday, a software time bomb was set to go off at 3 p.m. E.D.T., when all the SoBig-infected machines were to have received new instructions from 20 infected master machines. Cybersleuths, evidently, tracked down the menacing masters and had their Internet access cut off. 
All this happened only a week after another worm, doing business as Blaster among other names, had disrupted the Internet for millions of users. 
In both cases, which disrupted corporate networks and forced home PC users to take remedial measures -- or ignore the problem at their peril -- the worms exploited vulnerabilities in the networking capabilities of recent versions of Microsoft Windows, the operating system used on most PC's. 
So far, the attacks smell a lot more like vandalism than terrorism. But the potential for serious disruption of electronic commerce has nevertheless prompted Secretary Tom Ridge's Department of Homeland Security, among other organizations, to dispense several advisories. 
Not to put too geeky a point on it, but I am wondering whether the cyber-G-men in Mr. Ridge's department are in a position to do the homeland much good, wormwise. 
Late last month, as the Blaster worm was emerging, but before it had made headlines, the Department of Homeland Security issued a timely warning, "Potential for Significant Impact on Internet Operations Due to Vulnerability in Microsoft Operating Systems." The warning was posted on the department's Web site, and bulletins were e-mailed to security professionals.
In that two-page note, the department suggested that Internet service providers and other corporate network administrators should shut off several network ports to block the spread of the Blaster infection. 
Each of the 65,000 ports on a server computer is used by a specific software application to communicate across the Internet. The identifying number of the port can be used to keep track of which application is being used by worms and viruses.
As a result of the Homeland Security advisory, administrators at Internet service providers, including Cox Communications and AT&T Broadband, decided to cut their systems off from inbound access to the three ports recommended in the advisory: numbers 135, 139 and 445. 
Unfortunately, blocking these ports cuts off several other legitimate applications, including the ability of remote users to get their e-mail from Microsoft Exchange servers across the public Internet.
Despite such drawbacks, did the advisory make sense? At least one outside expert says it did, given the department's need to offer warnings without being so specific as to invite further attacks of the same sort. 
"You are always balancing how much do you really say in the advisory," said Howard Schmidt, a network security specialist who has worked for Microsoft, was a cybersecurity czar in the Bush administration and now is the chief information officer at eBay. "If you say too much, then people can exploit it. If you say too little, then you are practicing security by obscurity." 
Other experts say that the Homeland Security Department has begun collaborating with private industry on network security issues, but that there is room for improvement. 
The department "is doing a good job of reaching out to the business community," says Dave McCurdy, president of an industry trade group, the Internet Security Alliance. "However, they are underfunded, understaffed and overworked, and have to deal with melding different departments and pulling together for a common mission." 
The department's national cybersecurity division, for example, is still putting together a team recruited from the Pentagon, the F.B.I. and the General Services Administration among other federal operations, and a division chief has yet to be named.
In any case, the advisory was not complete enough to really help fight Blaster and similar worms and viruses. Missing from the document, for example, was information about how the Blaster worm propagated around corporate networks, using a special file transfer port (port 69, for those keeping score at home) that is used mainly for mundane administrative tasks like uploading routerconfiguration software. The worm uses this port to move copies of itself onto other machines, without need for any user action like clicking on attachments or opening particular messages. 
All it takes is someone to bring in an infected machine and attach it to a corporate network, as someone did at the company where I work, and the worm will quickly spread. Of course, our network administrators have now blocked port 69 to prevent subsequent attacks.
Besides helping sound the alert, there may be only so much the Homeland Security Department can do about cyberattacks or, if it comes to that, cyberterrorism. This sort of security, after all, needs literally to start at home, with users of Microsoft Windows taking care to maintain and update their systems, using antivirus software and the various patches that Microsoft issues. 
This can be cumbersome, even for the best intentioned user, especially because Microsoft has hundreds of patches for different Windows versions. 
"Trying to download a patch is not the most intuitive thing to do, especially if you are like me and have dial up access at home," said Sallie MacDonald, a senior executive in Homeland Security's national cybersecurity division. 
"It took me over two hours to update my home Windows machine," Ms. MacDonald said. "We need to make security easier and less cumbersome, and put the burden back on the software vendors to fix their code." 
Fire wall hardware is also a good idea, particularly for computers using always-on broadband Internet connections. (Some of the more paranoid might consider switching their most critical machines to Apple Macintoshes, which are not usually affected by attacks like Blaster and SoBig.F.) 
Providers of broadband Internet access also need to understand the nature of such attacks and the ramifications if they block ports. To the credit of one cable broadband supplier, Cox Communications, the company did issue warnings to its users that Exchange connections would be interrupted while Cox dealt with the Blaster attack. But many other Internet service providers could have done a better job of disseminating such information. 
Corporate network administrators need to put in place policies that assume the internal network is no longer composed of trusted machines, and deploy their equipment accordingly. There are simply too many vectors for infection these days. 
"Most home users felt that they didn't have to worry about security," Ms. MacDonald said. "Hopefully, these incidents have raised our level of awareness as users." 
Maybe Mr. Ridge needs to add a couple of new color codes to indicate worm and virus attacks.

Wi-Fi Technology MovesFrom Storeroom to Store

BYLINE:  By ROY FURCHGOTT 

 BODY:
Ann Marie Diogo has been a waitress for 18 years. So she was skeptical when her boss at the Royal Mile Pub in Wheaton, Md., recently replaced her paper order pad with a Toshiba palm computer that can wirelessly send her customers' orders directly to the kitchen. 
 "I was panicking," Ms. Diogo said. "I'm not that computer savvy." But when her faster service resulted in larger tips, she was won over. "There's no way I'd like to go back to pen and paper," she said. 
 Better still, said the pub's owner, Ray Morrison, who can monitor all the tables and even send complimentary drinks remotely from his Toshiba, errors in the kitchen are down and profits are up about 15 percent since the Royal Mile converted early this year to its wireless system, which is based on the increasingly popular Wi-Fi format. 
The pub is hardly alone in bringing Wi-Fi to the sales floor. Wi-Fi may be more celebrated as a means of logging into the Internet without cables. But the fast-dropping price of Wi-Fi, technically known as the 802.11 format, and its ability to convey a large volume of digital data wirelessly over short distances have made it possible for various businesses to improve sales and profits, while better serving customers face to face. 
The business world, of course, has long used wireless technology to track inventory and speed shipping. But often, such networks used proprietary technology that could be expensive and only sometimes reliable. Compared with many older systems, standardized Wi-Fi technology, which can broadcast data about 500 times faster than a cellphone, is exceedingly stable, if only because as it becomes more common, feedback from its many users has led to continual improvements. 
And the high volume of production, driven by popular demand, has pushed the price down to less than $100 for the local network routers at the heart of the systems and less than $100 for the wireless circuit card that connects a device, like a palm or laptop computer, to the network. 
"Last year under 20 percent of the laptops had Wi-Fi built in; this year it's 40 percent," said Brian Grimm, a spokesman for the Wi-Fi Alliance, a trade association.
Operators of stadiums, casinos, groceries, hospitals and department stores are among those who have recognized the value of bringing wireless technology out of the storeroom and into the store.
Stop & Shop, the 336-store grocery chain based in Boston, had used specialized wireless hand-held devices to track inventory for more than a decade. But in April the company put an 802.11 network in shoppers' carts through a portable device called the Shopping Buddy. The device lets customers perform feats like order a pound of pastrami from the deli counter while wheeling through the canned-goods aisle, and then alerts them when the order is ready. 
Shopping Buddy also has a location device to guide customers to hard-to-find items, and a bar code scanner that keeps tabs on purchases for budgeting and to let shoppers zoom through a self-checkout lane. Using a Shopping Buddy involves running the customer's Stop & Shop loyalty card through the built-in magnetic stripe reader. 
"It knows who you are. It knows what you buy when you are usually there," said Mira Genser, a spokeswoman for Cuesol of Quincy, Mass., which designed the Shopping Buddy's software. 
Nordstrom, an avatar of customer service, is installing a wireless network and stationary terminals that can replace the sales staff's "personal books," notepads that sales associates use to write down personal information about regular customers, like clothing sizes and favorite brands. "If there is a Donna Karan trunk show, we can suggest the top 10 clients for the sales associate to call," said Al Falcione, the senior product marketing manager for Blue Martini Software, which designed the Nordstrom system. Although Nordstrom is not initially giving its staff hand-held devices that are tied to the system, the system can accommodate them, Mr. Falcione said. The devices would allow the staff to locate an orange polo shirt in size XXL in any Nordstrom store, right from the sales floor. 
The casino and hotel operator Harrah's Entertainment of Las Vegas has tested several uses of Wi-Fi at its properties. Curbside check-in lets high rollers bypass the hotel registration desk and shortens lines for all guests. The hand-held terminal can also direct a host to dole out perks on the spot, checking information on specific guests to see if their past business warrants a free meal or show or even a free room, said Tim Stanley, Harrah's chief information officer.
Harrah's has also experimented with using roving cashiers, who tote hand-held terminals to verify player winnings and make payments on the casino floor, so the customers can keep gambling when they would otherwise be standing in line at the payout window. A small portable printer even spits out federal tax forms at tableside. "It keeps them in the action longer, frankly," Mr. Stanley said. 
Does Harrah's worry about hackers trying to invade the wireless payout system? The company is exceedingly security minded, Mr. Stanley said, and Wi-Fi is "as rock solid as anything wireless can be."
Like any radio signal, though, 802.11 is prone to disruption. That is a particular concern in steel and concrete structures like stadiums, said Ron Mandel, a technology director for Aramark, a Philadelphia company that specializes in managing concessions at sporting and entertainment events, among other areas. 
Aramark has installed Wi-Fi food-ordering systems in nine professional stadiums, so that waiters at the premium seats in Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, for example, can process an order for nachos without leaving the section.
A sellout game can be a challenge, because among other considerations Wi-Fi waves have difficulty traveling through water.
"Humans are made of liquid, so when you put enough people in the seats, communications can deteriorate," Mr. Mandel said. "There's nothing like a full house to fully see how good your communication really is."
In efficiency and customer relations, restaurants may have the most to gain from Wi-Fi. Wireless hand-held devices save waiters trips to the kitchen, allowing more time with customers. Errors are reduced because the printed order tickets received in the kitchen are easier to read than the average waiter's scrawl.
Burgermaster, a family-owned chain in Bellevue, Wash., that includes two drive-in restaurants where carhops still hang trays with burgers, shakes and fries on the driver's-side windows, installed its first wireless ordering system 15 years ago, using proprietary technology. 
"The manager wanted to try it, and we actually gave him a pretty hard time about it," said Bob Jensen, a Burgermaster vice president and son of the founder. But that system sped up customer turnover so much that sales increased to $1,200 an hour, from $800, on the first day of use. 
Recently, Burgermaster replaced its system with a Wi-Fi setup. The new system, which uses hand-held Compaq iPAQ PC's, cost $55,000, less than half the amount of the original wireless network, factoring in inflation, Mr. Jensen said. 
Burgermaster bought 12 Windows-based iPAQ's to ensure that at least 6 are always operational. "They are computers, and we run them hard, 24/7," Mr. Jensen said. Batteries need recharging, for example, sometimes the iPAQ's, being computers, will crash. And "sometimes they don't want to connect." 
But so vital are the wireless iPAQ's to Burgermaster's operation that Mr. Jensen requires the carhops to tether them to their wrists, at the risk of demotion. "If I find a carhop without a tether," he said, "they become a fountain person."

 BODY:
More alarm bells. This time they're being rung by a bearded New York physician whose mature, low-key manner (bedside and otherwise) is the farthest you can imagine from alarmist.
 Now 59, Dr. Irwin Redlener has spent many years delivering health care to poor and neglected children throughout the United States. Back in the 1980's he and the musician Paul Simon (in an outstanding collaboration of hip and square) created the Children's Health Fund, which turned specially equipped vans into mobile units that could be driven to wherever the underserved children were. 
 When the World Trade Center was attacked, Dr. Redlener immediately sent vans from the Children's Health Fund to the triage center that was set up on Manhattan's West Side. That sudden experience of the intersection of medicine and terror led to an entirely new mission.
Dr. Redlener is now one of the key individuals working on the urgent task of developing strategies to care for the sick and wounded in the event of another terrorist attack. He's the founding director of the new National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.
At the moment our state of readiness is not good.
"My biggest concern," said Dr. Redlener, "is that now, nearly two years after 9/11, the hospitals and public health systems are absolutely unprepared for another major act of terrorism. There's been very little improvement from two years ago. No one's really even defined what we mean by preparedness."
Extensive steps have been taken to prevent the use of airliners in another Sept. 11-type attack. But Dr. Redlener noted that there is a wide range of potential acts of terror that front-line emergency organizations, hospitals and the public health system may have to cope with. "We need to be prepared for things like car bombs, or a terrorist attack on a nuclear power facility. We need to be prepared for the release of a chemical or biological agent in a public place -- a train station, an airport, a sports arena. We need to be prepared for sabotage of major infrastructural systems -- bridges, for example, and transportation and communications facilities.
"The health care system has to be ready to respond effectively to any of these emergencies. And right now it's not."
A series of recent studies have found that not just the health care system, but also critical organizations like police and fire departments and public school systems are dangerously unprepared.
A study commissioned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and released just last week by the RAND Corporation found that most emergency workers in the 40 cities and towns surveyed "feel vastly underprepared and underprotected for the consequences of chemical, biological or radiological terrorist attacks."
A study prepared for an association that represents school safety officers found that while its members believed their schools were potential "soft targets" for terrorists, they did not feel the schools were prepared to cope with an attack.
Other recent studies have found that most urban hospitals do not have the medical equipment needed to handle the number of patients that would likely result from a bioterrorist attack, and that the federal government's ability to fend off such an attack may well be jeopardized by "a shortage of science and medical experts."
Dr. Redlener and his colleagues at the National Center for Disaster Preparedness are trying to help bring a greater sense of order and effectiveness to the current chaotic state of disaster planning in the U.S. They are trying to do this in a kind of think tank-plus atmosphere, combining intensive research with very practical tasks, such as the development and coordination of training programs, specialized curriculums and protocols. (The military has already done important work in this area and Dr. Redlener said those efforts should be more widely shared.)
Dr. Redlener met recently with the homeland security secretary, Tom Ridge, whom he described as a "very able and responsive" official, who is grappling with an almost overwhelming mandate.
"We need national standards and benchmarks for what should be done," Dr. Redlener said. "We need new ways of looking at these problems. This whole issue of preparedness could end up being the ultimate Achilles' heel for America."

HEADLINE: A Garden Flourishes Amid Chicago's Projects 

BYLINE:  By MONICA DAVEY 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 24 

 BODY:
The buffalo mozzarella at Fortunato, a tony restaurant in this city's Wicker Park neighborhood, is flown in from Naples, Italy, but some of the tomatoes tucked beside the cheese come from a place far closer. Though the diners here know nothing of it, the gourmet tomatoes are grown on the unlikeliest of farms, in a lot beside Cabrini Green, long one of the nation's most notorious public housing projects.
 On the little North Side lot, tomato plants and sunflowers poke up into a horizon that on one end includes Chicago's downtown skyline and on the other reveals the remaining towers of the deteriorating housing development. The tiny fenced farm draws stares from the people who live here. 
 "Looks like home to me," Mattie Dix, who is 72, said admiringly, as she gazed through the fence the other day. "Alabama." 
But others seem puzzled by the farm, even skeptical. "That won't be there long," said Jerome Taylor, who grew up in Cabrini Green four decades ago. "I don't even know what they are doing here, but there's no way this will last."
Actually, Mr. Taylor is right. It will not last, nor was it ever meant to. But at a time when Cabrini Green and the rest of the city's high-rise public housing developments are coming down, and when whatever will come next is not yet complete, a farmer has stepped in with his own dream.
Although city gardens are hardly a new concept, what makes this one different, aside from its especially urban setting, is that its produce has become a popular commodity for some of the city's finest restaurants.
Worlds away from Cabrini Green and worlds away as well from the expensive restaurants that now feature his vegetables, Ken Dunn grew up on a farm in Kansas.
He moved here in the 1960's to study philosophy at the University of Chicago, and has spent much of the past 30 years wandering the city trying to transform it into a place that recycles its waste, reuses its old machinery, composts its scraps and creates an alternative economy that is, in his eyes, both sustainable and just.
Mr. Dunn, who is 60, wears dirt-caked work boots and a plain baseball cap and has a small puff of hair beneath his bottom lip. His philosophy has a pragmatic edge.
"The back-to-nature movement did intrigue me," Mr. Dunn said last week, as he sat on a stack of hay in the lot beside Cabrini Green and accepted the mud-covered rocks presented to him, one after the next, by his 2-year-old son, Soren. "But it intrigued me with the full knowledge that the world would arrive with bulldozers some day."
The city-owned land near Division Street and Clybourn Avenue is ultimately to be used for mixed income housing and businesses. But for now -- as the city waits for a development deal -- the land is empty, and the city has allowed Mr. Dunn's nonprofit organization to build a temporary organic farm on a lot that is smaller than an acre, no charge.
Alicia Berg, the city's planning and development commissioner, said she viewed Mr. Dunn's idea as an innovative experiment, and one that matches Mayor Richard M. Daley's desire for the "greening" of Chicago. The city has recently agreed to let Mr. Dunn expand the farm onto a second acre, just south of the current farm. A mound of dirt awaits.
"To a certain extent, it looks out of place," said Walter Burnett Jr., who grew up in Cabrini Green and is now the alderman for the ward that includes it. His memory of the land from years past was bleaker: a vacant lot and lots of weeds.
Mr. Dunn has hauled in rich dirt and wood chips. He uses no chemicals. He admires bumblebees as the best pollinators. He has a compost pile decomposing nearby, steam rising.
And while his organization, the Resource Center, is nonprofit, Mr. Dunn and his partner, Kristine Greiber, by no means view these crops as a way for rich buyers to give charity for something grown in a rough neighborhood.
"This is not a hobby," Mr. Dunn said. "This is a real product, and part of that is that it must make money. To make a permanent change in society, it has to function in the existing economy, being able to bring its benefits while paying its bills."
Razor wire tops the fence that surrounds the farm, and though Mr. Dunn and Ms. Greiber will sell to locals who stop at the gate for lowered rates, they charge steep prices to restaurants. Their 30 varieties of prized, fragile-skinned heirloom tomatoes, for example, go for $3 to $3.50 a pound. The farm can produce about $45,000 in vegetables in a year, Mr. Dunn said.
Chefs in some of the city's best-known restaurants, meanwhile, are well aware of where these vegetables are grown, and interested in many of Mr. Dunn's thoughts about food and waste and sustainable living. 
"But I don't do anything here as a do-gooder thing," said Bruce Sherman, chef at the North Pond restaurant in Lincoln Park, who favors Mr. Dunn's beets, onions and specialty lettuce. "As a cook, this is about the quality of the products -- first and foremost, it tastes good and looks good."
George Bumbaris, executive chef for the Ritz-Carlton, prefers the tomatoes, which sometimes arrive still warm from the sun.
"To me, this sounded a little weird in the beginning," Mr. Bumbaris said of Mr. Dunn's farm. "But when we brought the tomatoes in the kitchen -- well, I didn't grow up on a farm, but I know what a tomato should taste like."

HEADLINE: Straitjackets, Machetes and, Oh Yes, Some Books 

BYLINE:  By COLIN MOYNIHAN

 BODY:
Shortly after 8 p.m. on Saturday, Tanya Sullivan and Okra P. Dingle walked onto a wooden stage at the Galapagos Art Space in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where some 30 people had gathered. Over the next hour Ms. Sullivan freed herself from a straitjacket and lay on a bed of rusty nails. Mr. Dingle removed his shoes and socks and climbed a "ladder of swords," consisting of four machetes in a wooden framework, and then, balanced on the topmost blade, placed a cinder block on his head and smashed the block with a hammer.
 The performance brought to mind a circus sideshow, but it was the prelude to the New York opening of the Autonomadic Bookmobile, which for two years has traveled the country carrying books by Autonomedia, a small nonprofit Williamsburg publisher that prints criticism by authors like Dwight McDonald, Guy Debord and Michel Foucault. 
 Susan Ash, 32, a sound engineer from the Lower East Side, said she had never heard of a bookmobile that included sideshow acts. "It was really interesting," she said. "And at the same time it was kind of creepy." 
As the bookmobile arrived in New York on Friday from its base in New Orleans, Jim Fleming, 53, a founder of Autonomedia, sat in the South 11th Street loft that serves as the publishing company's editorial office and said his fascination with bookmobiles dated to his days at the University of Iowa in the late 1960's, when he eagerly awaited a bookmobile carrying texts from university presses.
"I could get books I couldn't find anywhere else," he said.
In the early 1990's, Mr. Fleming said, the Bindlestiff Family Cirkus began bringing Autonomedia books on tour. The circus brought the books to a new audience, and in 2001 Mr. Fleming spent $2,000 to buy a 1987 Ford Econoline van that had been modified to resemble a medium-size truck. He turned the keys over to Ms. Sullivan and Mr. Dingle, who were natural choices, he said, because they liked books and shared his fondness for utopian and anti-authoritarian elements of philosophy. Last year, when Mr. Dingle and Ms. Sullivan moved from the Lower East Side to New Orleans, they brought the bookmobile with them, while Autonomedia remained in Brooklyn.
Autonomedia, whose staff members are volunteers, has published more than 200 books. Typically, about 3,000 copies of each book are printed, Mr. Fleming said. But the publisher's best-known book, "T.A.Z." (Temporary Autonomous Zone), a collection of essays on autonomy by Hakim Bey, has sold about 30,000 copies.
Generally, sales from all Autonomedia books total about $150,000 per year, Mr. Fleming said. He noted that without the marketing budget enjoyed by big houses, he must be inventive to make his books available to a wide audience.
Besides Autonomedia books, Ms. Sullivan and Mr. Dingle carry volumes by other small publishers and what they call "the cabinet of curious information," which contains political pamphlets and the self-produced periodicals known as zines. They said that their experiences on the road have been varied. In the fall of 2001, they said, the police in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, saw Ms. Sullivan walking on shattered glass and wondered aloud whether she was engaging in witchcraft. Other times, strangers have offered to cook them dinner. 
The traveling life is far from luxurious, with Ms. Sullivan and Mr. Dingle sleeping in the back of the bookmobile. So far, the venture has not broken even, but the two, who sometimes work other jobs, said they hoped that it would soon. In the meantime, they said, traveling the country while participating in an exchange of ideas is its own reward. 
After the show, Mr. Dingle stood next to the side of the vehicle, which bore the painted words "Demand the Impossible." As people bought books like "Electronic Civil Disobedience," an Autonomedia title about politics and culture, he said that he hoped bookmobile visitors would be inspired to start up equally unusual projects. 
"If we dream alone, it's just a dream," he said. "But if we dream together, it's reality."

HEADLINE: Old ID Card Gives New Status to Mexicans in U.S. 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS 

 BODY:
For nearly a decade, Reynaldo Montes De Oca Suarez strived to be invisible. He melted in and out of crowds, ducking police officers and city officials. He flourished in the bustling anonymity of restaurant kitchens here, building a life as a cook amid the clattering plates and spitting frying pans.
 But in recent months, Mr. Montes de Oca and other undocumented immigrants from Mexico have begun stepping out of the shadows. This summer, Indianapolis and seven other Midwestern cities started accepting an identity card issued by the Mexican government, offering Mexicans who are here illegally a startlingly new sense of legitimacy. 
 In East Chicago, Ind., immigrants with the Mexican identification card, known as the matricula consular, can now borrow library books and arrange city water services. In Cincinnati, police officers accept the card from crime victims, witnesses and suspects. 
In Indianapolis, immigrants carrying the matricula card can apply for building licenses and permits to drive taxis and operate vending carts.
 The card has been issued by the Mexican government for more than 100 years to keep track of its citizens in the United States. But across this country cities and states are increasingly recognizing the card, too, as officials seek ways to identify residents in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and try to better serve immigrants.
Many bankers, merchants and politicians have also embraced the card, whose name translates to consular registration, hoping to appeal to the growing number of Hispanic consumers and voters. 
 The shift has been accompanied by a rising outcry, particularly among some Republicans in Congress, who argue that the widening acceptance of the card is creating a de facto amnesty for illegal immigrants.
 In March 2002, only a handful of cities and banks recognized the matricula card, Mexican officials say. Today, more than 100 cities, 900 police departments, 100 financial institutions and 13 states, including Indiana, New Mexico and Utah, accept the cards, which carry the bearer's photo, name and address and are issued by Mexican consulates to Mexicans regardless of their immigration status.
Emboldened by the changing climate, Mr. Montes de Oca recently carried his card into the red brick offices of National City Bank, which started wooing undocumented immigrants with matricula cards last year. 
 Within minutes, he had his first checking account and debit card.
 "It makes me feel good to see the matricula accepted in so many places," said Mr. Montes de Oca, 29, who was rejected when he tried to open a bank account last year because he lacked a Social Security number. "This makes me feel welcome."
Illegal immigrants who carry the matricula card still risk deportation and are still barred from working by federal law. They cannot use the card to register to vote, change their immigration status or to obtain Social Security numbers or work permits. But they often live more freely in cities that recognize the card. And in several states, possession of a matricula card is the first step toward a driver's license. 
Officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security say this is worrisome because they believe the card is vulnerable to fraud and misuse by criminals and terrorists, a contention that Mexican and some American officials dispute. 
In July, the House approved a measure that would authorize the State Department to regulate all consular identification cards issued by Mexico and other countries, requiring such countries to supply the names and addresses of everyone issued a card, among other things. That same month, four Republicans in Congress wrote to the Department of Homeland Security to express their concern about the proliferation of the matricula card. They said they feared other countries might issue similar cards.
"Any federal government acceptance of unreliable identification cards from persons resident in the United States compromises our homeland security," wrote the four Republicans, including F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
The Bush administration and Congress remain deeply divided over the issue, with some moderate Republicans and some officials from the State and Treasury Departments offering support for the Mexican card.
Senator Richard G. Lugar,Republican of Indiana and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has defended the matricula card.
"These cards pose no risk to our antiterrorism efforts," Mr. Lugar said in June. "In fact, cards that simplify identification of immigrants and facilitate their contact with Americans and our institutions are a benefit to public safety, not a liability." 
Also in June, the Treasury Department issued regulations that gave banks the option of accepting the matricula card as identification, but the department agreed to reconsider after Mr. Sensenbrenner and other Republicans objected. A final decision on the matter is expected soon.
The White House has yet to take a formal position. And while federal officials debate, cities are changing their policies one by one.
In June, the mayors of the Indiana cities Fort Wayne, East Chicago, Columbus and Indianapolis announced they would accept the matricula card. In July the State of Indiana and the cities of Madison, Ind., and Cleveland and Columbus in Ohio recognized it. 
This month, Cincinnati followed suit. Officials say the move would be a boon to local economies, encouraging Mexican immigrants to pour money into banks and businesses. They also say immigrants with bank accounts will be less vulnerable to criminals who prey on people who carry cash or keep money at home.
Some places have chosen to buck this trend. This year, Colorado barred the use of the matricula card, citing concerns about its reliability. Last year, New York City Police Department officials said they had declined to accept the card, and officials in New Jersey and Connecticut expressed similar reluctance.
But Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon of Indiana said he remained convinced that the cards were secure. Governor O'Bannon said they provided what many officials need in the post-Sept. 11 era: a reliable means of identifying people who might otherwise be unidentifiable. 
Albert G. Huntington, the mayor of Madison, Ind., agreed. Mr. Huntington said he could not ignore the needs of the Mexican workers who were increasingly filling jobs in his small town. Recognition of the matricula card, he said, was simply a reflection of the demographic changes rippling across the Midwest.
"They're coming, one way or another," said Mr. Huntington, who has decided to offer city services to Mexican immigrants in his town of 12,500 people. "So you have a choice. You can recognize them or you can ignore them and allow problems to develop."
Mexico began distributing the matricula consular in the 1870's as a means of identifying and registering its citizens in the United States, officials say. 
For more than a century, the card was used to ensure that Mexican immigrants could receive consular assistance in dealing with American employers and police and help in shipping belongings home or relatives back for burial. The card was not typically used for dealing with American authorities.
That changed after Sept. 11, 2001, as possession of a photo ID became a prerequisite for entering many office buildings and hospitals, for buying train tickets and wiring money and as states began considering barring illegal immigrants from obtaining driver's licenses. 
Talks between the United States and Mexico about an amnesty for the estimated four million Mexican illegal immigrants living here stalled. And Mexican diplomats began lobbying for acceptance of the matricula card.
These days, the Mexican consul here, Sergio Aguilera, drives from city to city, making his pitch. This week, he shuttled between East Chicago, where he met with the mayor, and Indianapolis, where he tried to persuade credit union executives to join the businesses that accept the card.
"In this past it was not so important," Mr. Aguilera said. "Now we have increased our efforts. I have been traveling like crazy, talking to mayors, police departments and city councils. We need their understanding and their support."
Applicants for the card must apply in person at their local consulate and provide supporting documents like birth certificates, Mexican passports and voting cards. In March 2002, the Mexican government introduced an advanced matricula card with security features, including invisible coding that can be read only with special detectors.
The F.B.I. estimates, however, that more than 90 percent of matricula cards belong to an earlier generation that lacks such security features. Even the newer card can be forged, officials say, along with the supporting documents. The F.B.I. also warned that Mexico's outdated databases allowed multiple cards to be issued with the same name, address and photograph. 
Mexican officials counter that the older cards are being phased out as people renew their cards. They say their computer databases will soon be updated and that additional security features are in the works.
The officials also note that criminals successfully counterfeit most identification cards, including American driver's licenses, Social Security cards and green cards. They say the benefits of the matricula card are clear to police officers, businesses and immigrants who can already feel the difference.
Ricardo Mondragon, a 41-year-old cook, presented his matricula card at a store here two weeks ago as he bought sneakers with his debit card. He said he marveled when the cashier accepted the card without a second glance.
"All of us, we try to get the card," Mr. Mondragon said. "It really helps a lot."

HEADLINE: Technology and Brain Power Used to Tame an Aging Grid 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH CHANG 

 BODY:
The day-to-day operation of the nation's power grid is, in many respects, a great marvel -- a second-by-second balancing act of the tremendously volatile thing known as electricity, a sometimes wicked creature with a mind of its own that can cause great damage in a hurry.
 The grid, much misunderstood, is not a programmable network like the phone system or the Internet. Electricity cannot be sent from here to there in nice packages. 
 Rather, the grid is like a giant invisible reservoir where the amount of power being put in at any moment must match the amount being consumed.
"It's the ultimate perishable," said Dr. Paul M. Grant, a science fellow at the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif. 
That the power grid has suffered only a handful of major collapses in nearly half a century is, to many, a good record. And despite much criticism in the last 11 days that the grid is antiquated, the system's transmission towers, power lines and transformers are not rusting hulks on the verge of collapse.
However, the damage that is done when a swath of the United States goes dark -- in public confidence and economic losses as well as huge inconvenience -- has kept engineers working on technology to make the grid more reliable. Indeed, experts are proposing billions of dollars of new equipment to relieve congestion at bottlenecked electrical junctions on the grid and improve the system's ability to limit the damage when something does go wrong -- concerns that will only increase with rising power demands.
The new technology includes totally electronic switches able to divert electrical flows protectively at moments of crisis. It also includes superconducting cables that carry greater quantities of electricity, which will allow utilities to add transmission capacity without building unsightly transmission towers.
Some of the ideas and inventions are in place to one degree or another in certain parts of the country. Others will soon be tested in pilot projects.
The new technology is needed in part to respond to the consequences of deregulation. Power producers now sell electricity to distant utilities, putting far more strains on the grid.
"Many of us call it the largest machine that man has ever made, and it serves its purpose admirably well," Dr. Grant said.
But, he added, "it's confused now because the power flows can come from any direction and go anywhere, and that was not the situation it was originally designed for."
With the investigation of the Aug. 14 blackout continuing, no one is yet sure of its precise cause or how much the proposed upgrades or improvements would have helped, if at all. A 100 percent reliable grid is impossible, experts say.
"We'll always have blackouts," said Dr. Robert H. Lasseter, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Wisconsin. "It's like we'll always have forest fires and automobile accidents."
Even when a better technology exists, economics and policy considerations have sometimes limited widespread use. Investment in the grid has dropped sharply in recent years.
For instance, for three decades, silicon electronic switches have been available as replacements for some of the mechanical circuit breakers at power substations across the country. Electronic switches act more quickly. But a more important advantage is that, unlike mechanical switches, they can manage electrical flow more subtly.
Mechanical switches can only be open or closed, but the electronic switches can act more like water valves, letting some of the current through. That would allow grid operators to narrow the river of electric current quickly on an overburdened power line without shutting it down entirely.
The electronic switches, each about the size and shape of a hockey puck, can be wired together to perform fancier electric transformations that could vary how much power the substation injects into the grid.
"You can put in some control on the line," said John Schwartzenberg, engineering manager of Silicon Power Corporation of Exton, Pa., a company that manufactures the electronic switches.
The switches have been tested but not widely deployed because of cost. The price to upgrade a substation is $1 million or more, although upgrades would be necessary only at key points of the grid.
"It's not a minimum investment by any stretch of the imagination," said Jack M. Ladden, chief operating officer of Silicon Power.
By coincidence, on the day of the blackout, Intermagnetics General Corporation of Latham, N.Y., announced a $12 million program to develop a new type of electronic device to protect power grids from damaging surges in current. The federal Department of Energy is providing half of the financing, and the Electric Power Research Institute is also participating.
When a power station suffers a short circuit, electric currents can jump from a couple of thousand amperes to 60,000 amperes or more. When a circuit breaker opens to interrupt the short circuit, current can arc across the gap, probably destroying the circuit breaker, and often escalating the problem.
The new device, called a fault current limiter, is intended to act as a brake on the current, allowing the circuit breaker to operate safely and limiting damage to the station, and thus perhaps also restricting the spread of problems in a city or region.
Intermagnetics plans to install a prototype at a power substation in three years.
The company is also involved in a $26 million project that will, it hopes, help address the fundamental question of how to safely accommodate greater demands for power -- a 1,150-foot-long cable made of superconductors to be added to the power grid in Albany. Superconductors can carry three to five times as much power as the copper and aluminum cables in the country's transmission lines.
Utilities hope to use superconducting cables to increase the transmission capacity in congested portions of the grid without building additional towers.
Superconductor cables will be buried underground and can be laid in the same corridors that existing transmission towers use.
Construction of the Albany project will begin next spring with completion by fall 2005. Two other superconducting cable projects are also in the planning stages, one for Long Island, the other in Columbus, Ohio.
American Superconductor Corporation of Westborough, Mass., is leading a project that will install a half-mile-long superconducting cable capable of carrying 600 million watts from a Long Island substation in East Garden City, N.Y. Completion is also expected in 2005.
With greater capacity, superconducting cables could allow utilities to build in more buffers to handle unexpected failures, experts say. But, Dr. Lasseter pointed out, a higher-capacity cable would also cause bigger ripples if it failed.
Already, one superconducting cable pilot project -- in Detroit -- was stymied by cracks in the outer protective sheath around the cable that allowed coolant to leak out. (The superconductors require temperatures of around minus-320 degrees Fahrenheit to work.)
Another way to improve the reliability of the grid, many in the industry believe, would be to make the grid simpler, dividing it back into smaller regional pieces that are only loosely connected.
That way, even if a regional grid suffered a total blackout, the blackout would be less likely to cascade to neighboring grids.
Texas's power grid, for example, is already largely isolated from the rest of the country's. Electrical problems elsewhere would have difficulty cascading into Texas, and problems in the state would not affect the rest of the country.
"The complexity is nearly impossible to study and predict ahead of time," Dr. Lasseter said of the current grid that connects one region of the country to another. "Ultimately, you've got to reduce the complexity."
Some experts argue that the grid could be made less vulnerable by making a fundamental change in the high-capacity connections between regional grids. At present, the electricity pumped along most of these lines is, like most of the rest of the grid, in a form known as alternating current.
Pumping the electricity through these great connections in direct current instead, the experts say, would help prevent the spread of certain types of problems, like sudden swings in the frequency of the alternating current.
It was, after all, frequency fluctuations that caused many power plants to pull themselves offline on Aug. 14.
In a news conference Friday, Pat Wood III, head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said direct current connections would provide "interconnectivity through a much more controllable, manageable device" and "ought to be part of the technology mix."
Power problems for any particular part of the country would be further reduced if the equivalent of a large rechargeable battery could be developed.
The concept has been in operation for 12 years at a site in Alabama where electricity is stored as compressed air. Electrical pumps push air into an underground cavern at pressures up to 1,078 pounds per square inch, or more than 70 times ordinary atmospheric pressure.
The air is later released and heated to pass through a turbine generator, turning the stored energyback into electricity.
Electricity can be similarly stored by pumping water into reservoirs, but these strategies are not practical in most places. Hydrogen fuel cells might prove useful for power storage in the future, but that will have to wait.
"It's still pretty roll-your-eyes-back type of stuff," Dr. Grant said. "It's something that needs to be looked at."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Increased Reliability, Increased Reliance"Early power grids were run by local, self-sufficient utilities. As they grew, they began to connect their systems with neighboring utilities until eventually North America was divided into three giant grids. The interconnectivity can increase reliability and, through deregulation, can lower costs, but it also means interdependence -- a failure at one utility can be felt systemwide. When a Failure Occurs1. If equipment like a substation or generator fails, the rest of the grid usually supplies the immediate power needed to prevent a service lapse, but only for a short time. 2. The company has to increase production or purchase electricity from others. If nearby utilities cannot provide power, it will have to get it from farther away. 3. When companies transfer power, the seller increases production and the energy flows where it is needed along the path of least resistance. 4. To send electricity across neighboring companies' lines, a utility cannot transfer power if it will overload the lines of the intermediaries, which can also charge tariffs.

Independent system operators analyze each transfer request. Bottlenecks result when operators deny transfer requests because the infrastructure cannot handle the increased load.

HEADLINE: The Sand. The Surf. The Projects?; 
In Beachfront Public Housing, Sea Breezes Meet Apathy

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
The windows on one side of Desiree Bentsen's third-floor apartment overlook the hot concrete courtyard of the Ocean Village public housing complex in the Rockaways. Coarse arguments, loud rap music and sometimes the sound of gunfire waft in.
 But the windows on the other side of her apartment overlook a very different scene -- the Atlantic Ocean and a pristine stretch of beach -- and let in the roar of the waves, the squawks of sea gulls and the smell of salt air. 
 On Thursday afternoon, it was scorching outside. Mrs. Bentsen has no air-conditioning in her apartment, but the kitchen window let in a continuous cool sea breeze. 
Mrs. Bentsen, 47, has lived in this spacious three-bedroom apartment for seven years. The monthly rent is $900, $500 of which is covered by federal Section 8 rent subsidy vouchers. She has struggled to raise her four children.
"This is the only thing keeping us here," she said, pointing out her kitchen window to the beach. "There's a lot here I never wanted my kids to grow up with, but I look out at that beach and I say, 'No, we can't leave.' Once you go down by that water, it's another world. All the arguments and bad feelings people here have, it's all gone."
Ocean Village, in Queens, is not the only public housing complex in New York with water views.
There are housing projects in the Rockaways and Coney Island within sight of the ocean, but none are as close as Ocean Village.
From the front, the Ocean Village complex, aging beige buildings from Beach 56th Street to Beach 59th Street in the Arverne section of the Rockaways, looks like most blighted urban projects.
The residents are mostly poor, and outside the entrance, young men gather around loud radios and hold 40-ounce bottles and smoke marijuana. 
But out back, the complex abuts the boardwalk and hot concrete gives way to clean, white sand. The ocean, clean and kelpy, bears no resemblance to the murkier water at popular city beaches like Coney Island and Orchard Beach. A minute's walk across the sand from the complex's rear gates, the waves roll in gently and there are three lifeguard stands.
But most Ocean Village residents do not use the beach or celebrate its proximity. Mrs. Bentsen recalled the way her uncle from Lefrak City would rave about her $400-per-month oceanfront deal.
"He used to come over and have a fit about the view," she said. "He'd say, 'Some people just don't realize what they got. Do you realize people pay thousands of dollars to be on the beach?' I just chuckle at him."
Most residents, she said, do not take advantage of the beach or even the views.
Jonathan L. Gaska, district manager for the local Community Board 14, said that a lot of the working poor in the Rockaways do not know how to swim.
"It's a little bizarre for an oceanfront community," he said, "but it happens to be the case. They don't have a place to learn, and you don't learn to swim in the ocean. The waves can get rough.
"Hopefully, that will change," he continued, "because they're building thousands of units of affordable housing in the next five years and we've insisted on a rec center so they can learn."
For now, rather than learning how to swim, the children in Ocean Village -- O.V. to its residents -- learn how to deal with trouble. Just across the elevated A train tracks are Ocean Bay Houses, also known as the Edgemere Houses, long considered one of the city's most crime-ridden projects.
"People here got mad troubles in their life," said Steven Rocker, 22, who moved to Ocean Village when he was 12. "You don't want to sit on no beach to relax." Residents smoke something or drink something for that, he said. "You go through your own personal hell. This place is like something out of Dante."
Mr. Rocker never traveled to Manhattan until after high school, but now he is an undergraduate at Columbia University on full scholarship. On Thursday, he stood on a sunbaked stoop in O.V. keeping a sharp eye on his younger siblings and nephews. He wore a do-rag under his baseball hat, some jewelry, and expensive sneakers.
Mr. Rocker grew up the third of eight children in a first-floor apartment with ocean-facing windows. The sea breeze, not an air-conditioner, kept them cool. He pointed toward the complex's centerpiece: twin basketball courts.
"You see hundreds of people watching a basketball game there and not one person down on the beach," he said. "It's almost like that ocean doesn't exist. When my friends from Manhattan want to go to the beach, I say, 'Come to the one at my house. No one's ever on it.' They're shocked to see a housing complex on a beach."
He continued: "When I moved here, I thought I'd be on the beach the whole time. People think that just because we have it, we're going to use it, but a lot of black people don't swim."
He asked a teenage girl walking by in a full-length sweatshirt to explain to a stranger why the kids do not use the beach.
"It's dirty," she said without stopping. One of Mr. Rocker's younger brothers mumbled: "We go to the beach. We swim, we get tired. We stop and we come home."
Another brother, Jonathan, 21, said that the beach had a reputation for being dirty, even though that is no longer true.
Proving his point, Nikeema Perry, 12, said, "The beach is dirty," and her friend Goldie Campbell, 13, added: "Yeah, and the seaweed gets on your feet."
Ocean Village is flanked to the east and west by empty lots waiting for redevelopment. The elevated A train is to the north and a rickety boardwalk and endless ocean horizon are to the south.
Right now, schools of bluefish feed 50 yards offshore behind the complex, and large striped bass are running. But there are few fishermen here.
The sand and water seem to be as clean as they are at Long Beach and Jones Beach to the east. But even on hot summer days only a few dozen people are here. Sometimes the lifeguards outnumber beachgoers. The lifeguards know the O.V. residents and keep many of them from going in past their waist.
One recent evening, Von Miles, 31, and her sisters Kiki and Sunshine barbecued on the beach.
"Everyone comes to visit us here says the same thing: 'I can't believe you're right on the beach. If I lived here I'd be out there every day,' " said Von Miles. "And our first summer here, we did come here most every day. But then it gets to be like, it's just there."
Ms. Miles lives with her daughters, Fantasia Miles and Taniqua Watson. Kiki Miles, 26, has a balcony with a view of theocean.
Both Kiki and Von said that Ocean Village was inconvenient and dull, but a far cry better than the family shelters they lived in before this.
Many young people speak of feeling trapped here. They lack the money to go elsewhere and the patience for the long train and bus rides.
"We've always had the beach, so it's no big deal," said Eddie Banks, 17, who lives in an ocean-view apartment from which he can flick a cigarette butt onto the boardwalk. "What we really need is stores and movie theaters: somewhere to go. We're stuck here with nothing to do."
In Mrs. Bentsen's kitchen, her oldest son, Bruce Smith, 26, made himself some chocolate milk and said he was saving money as a security guard to move "anywhere else but here."
"I wouldn't care if there was a beachfront casino down there," he said. "I wouldn't go."
But some residents still do.
On Thursday, Sean Debouse, 12, and Dwayne Banks, 13, met outside the projects and ambled down to the water. Both dropped their pants on the beach and pulled on their bathing suits and made their way through the waves. They looked back toward O.V., which rises high out of the sand.
"Whoa, it's cold," said Sean.
"Feels great," said Dwayne.

HEADLINE: 2003 U.S. OPEN PREVIEW; 
The Real Open Era: Classes to Masses

BYLINE:  By NEIL AMDUR

 BODY:
The dream began in January 1977, on a plane circling La Guardia Airport, when Slew Hester saw a snow-covered, little-used stadium tucked in a section of Queens. Within days, Hester, the new president of the United States Tennis Association, had met with New York City officials and an architect, and drafted plans to transform America's largest tennis tournament, the United States Open, from the cozy confines of a private tennis club in Forest Hills to a public facility in Flushing Meadows.
 More than 25 years later, Hester's vision has surpassed his noblest expectations. From an initial $10 million investment in a facility that barely met its renovation deadline and attracted 275,300 spectators, the Open's growth has spawned a new $250 million showcase, an additional $50 million privately financed bond and two-week attendance that has surpassed 600,000 in each of the past three years. 
 "In my opinion, if there had not been a Slew Hester, it would not have happened," said David Kenneth Specter, the original architect of the project, who still smiles each time he recalls the highs and lows of a "really great professional experience."
Part of the Open's charm at the U.S.T.A. National Tennis Center, in its passage from the classes to the masses, has been its unpredictability -- from the roar of airplanes (taking off, landing and being rerouted) to the smoky scent of hamburgers blowing across a field court.
Many who sat through 12 hours of Super Saturday in 1984 lovingly call it "The Longest Day." It was perhaps the sport's greatest day. All four stadium-court matches went to decisive sets. And if the Open has had to live with its label as more commercial and less continental than Wimbledon or the French Open, no tournament packed more drama into women's singles finals than the riveting, emotionally draining third-set tie breakers that Martina Navratilova lost to Tracy Austin (1981) and Hana Mandlikova (1985). Now the women's singles final has a prime-time slot on Saturday night.
Since the Open moved from the West Side Tennis Club, it has remained fair game for the politicians (David N. Dinkins versus Rudolph W. Giuliani), the pundits ("Night tennis is not tennis, it is entertainment") and the purists ("No rest days between the semifinals and finals is ridiculous"). Social and cultural protesters ("For these prices, you can't even see the players from the top of the stadium") have also had their say.
But the Open was the first Grand Slam tournament to recognize parity in prize money for women. Its locker rooms have remained accessible long after other Grand Slams events have shut out the news media. And Hester's deal with New York City is almost a model for cooperation between the public and private sectors even as he cautioned his architect about expenditures ("What are you trying to do, build the Taj Mahal?" he barked when Specter told him chain-link railings were not acceptable).
The Open's expansion has gone well beyond Arthur Ashe Stadium. The number of acres has increased from the original 15 to 24.9 and now 46.5. And pro players are not the only people to benefit; from last Sept. 30 through July 30, public players logged 40,032 hours on the indoor and outdoor courts.
Then there is the so-called "economic impact" of the Open. At a time when the interest in tennis is lagging in this country, the Open, according to a study conducted by the Sport Management Research Institute provided $420 million in direct economic impact to New York New Jersey and Connecticut. 
Arlen Kantarian grew up in Forest Hills and still remembers sneaking into the Open at the West Side Tennis Club by hopping a fence.
"The move to Flushing Meadows gave the Open the room, the playing surface and the opportunity to grow into what it's become today -- one of the premier sporting events," said Kantarian, who is the chief executive of professional tennis for the U.S.T.A. and is pushing to unite the Open and other summer tournaments into a marketable circuit. "And the move has allowed the Open to take on the true characteristics of New York City."
Some traditionalists still pine for the ivy intimacy ofForest Hills. And the loss of the stately sycamore trees in the Grove during the new Flushing renovation appalled Specter and other environmentalists.
But for a successful oil wildcatter like Hester, who once said "selling abstract ideas" was the first step in digging a new hole, the Open's expansion was worth all the secret meetings. Hester was enshrined in the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1983 and died in 1993. The bronze plaque that adorns the grounds at the Open, with his profile and familiar cigar ("long and mild"), speaks for his legacy.
"The way you attain knowledge," Hester once observed, in what amounted to his credo, "is to go to college, get an education, start an argument, take either side, and then put your money in."

HEADLINE: On View: How King Shaped The Dream 

BYLINE:  By EMILY EAKIN 

 BODY:
His most famous words -- "I have a dream" -- were extemporized. And he routinely delivered whole sermons from memory. But as an extraordinary exhibition of his papers, books and other documents at Sotheby's auction house in Manhattan makes clear, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was an inveterate scribbler who jotted down thoughts and outlined speeches on the backs of envelopes and church programs and who scrawled entire essays in the flyleaves of paperbacks.
 Occupying 20,000 square feet -- nearly one a floor -- of the auction house, the sprawling exhibition opens to the public tomorrow and runs through Sept. 8. Sotheby's is offering the collection for private sale -- not at auction -- on behalf of the King estate. 
 Among the vast array of items on display are more than 7,000 documents in King's hand, from the blue book in which he wrote a Bible class examination while a student at Morehouse College to a diary he kept while jailed for civil disobedience in 1962 to the notepaper on which he drafted his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech in 1964, four years before his assassination. There is also a rare typewritten early draft of the "I Have a Dream" speech, of which only one paragraph made it into the final version. 
David N. Redden, a vice chairman of Sotheby's, called the collection "the most important nonpresidential archive of the 20th century in this country." 
Whatever its ranking in importance, it is certainly one of the more controversial. Though never exhibited to the public, the collection made headlines in 1999 when the Library of Congress tried to buy it. 
Sotheby's had appraised it at $30 million, and the King estate agreed to sell it to the library for $20 million -- a record amount for the institution. Congress voted to authorize the money, but the deal collapsed in committee hearings when House members questioned the expense. Some argued that the purchase would be a bad precedent, discouraging donations, which have been the traditional practice and the way the library has acquired the papers of civil-rights-era figures like BayardRustin and A. Philip Randolph.
While some of the material at Sotheby's was previously housed at the Martin Luther King Center in Atlanta and is familiar to scholars, much of it has been in storage at the Atlanta home of King's widow, Coretta Scott King, and has been seen by very few people.
From her home come dozens of handwritten sermons, sermon outlines and other religious writings from the 1950's and early 60's, as well as King's personal library. Among its 1,000 volumes is a 1958 paperback edition of essays by Emerson in which King scribbled a lengthy critique of the idea of "justification by faith" with a red pen. 
Annotations in other books offer tantalizing hints of how he developed signature themes and verbal motifs. For example, in a 1954 book of sermons by J. Wallace Hamilton, on the first page of a chapter titled "Shattered Dreams," King penciled an outline for a sermon also emphasizing dreams, with sections headed "When a dream becomes an illusion" and "Why this dream can never come true."
"I had forgotten until I saw it all laid out how prolific he was and how much there is in his own handwriting," Mrs. King said on Saturday, speaking by telephone from a hotel in Washington, where she was among those commemorating the 1963 March on Washington and King's "I Have a Dream" speech. "For someone who was as busy as he was and yet took the time while those campaigns were going on to produce so much material, it's truly amazing."
Word that the King collection is on the block again has revived concern in some quarters that his heirs might put personal profit ahead of the public interest. In the past, critics have complained about the estate's habit of demanding high fees from authors and television producers who seek to use King's words -- and of aggressively pursuing those who fail to get permission. 
In 1994 USA Today agreed to pay the King estate $1,700 plus legal fees after lawyers challenged that paper's right to print the text of King's "I Have a Dream" speech. And in 1996 lawyers for the estate sued CBS for marketing a video documentary about American history that included the network's own film of King and the March on Washington. (The case settled, with CBS retaining the right to use the images.)
"I am pleased that the King family has finally brought all the pieces of Martin Luther King's legacy together in one place," said Louise Cook, director of the King library and archives at the King Center from 1977 to 1987. "But I would be appalled if the collection did not go to a place where it would be accessible to scholars. I would hope that the family would lean toward providing access even if it meant compromising on the price."
Mr. Redden said that Sotheby's, which is on York Avenue at 72nd Street, was shopping the collection to a select group of universities, libraries and government agencies, though he declined to identify them. This time around, he said, there is no fixed asking price, though he added that "certainly, $20 million would not be an unreasonable sum at all."
Mrs. King said that the family's goal was to see the collection placed in a single institution that could guarantee public access to the materials and their long-term preservation. The estate will retain control over copyrights, she said.
"The $20 million would be what we would hope" the collection would sell for, she said. "The hope was that, because we don't have a lot of resources. If we were in a position to donate it, we would." 
Last year Sotheby's sold a rare cache of James Joyce manuscripts, including early drafts of "Ulysses," to the National Library of Ireland for $11.7 million. And in 1995 Winston Churchill's estate sold his papers to the British government for $20 million. But several scholars doubted that the King collection could fetch a price in that neighborhood from an American institution today.
"I don't think you could get anywhere close to $20 million," said David J. Garrow, a historian at Emory University and the author of "Bearing the Cross," a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Dr. King. "It's not just an inflated price; there's the fact that every other civil rights collection was just donated."
Not having examined the collection, he was reluctant to pass judgment on its contents, he said. But he wondered whether the new material would add all that much to the scholarly record. 
"While it will be wonderful to finally have scholarly and public access to materials that Mrs. King never made available to researchers at the King Center," Mr. Garrow said, "the value of this collection may well lie in its holographic originality rather than in anything novel about the substance of Dr. King's thinking."
Clayborne Carson, a historian at Stanford University who as the official editor of King's papers is one of the few scholars familiar with the entire collection, agreed that $20 million was probably an unrealistic sum, especially for a university during an economic recession. But he disputed the idea that the collection lacked scholarly value.
Of particular interest, he said, are the handwritten sermons and other religious writings retrieved from a file box in Mrs. King's home. The religious writings "help us get more to the private King, revealing how he thinks and how these materials relate to earlier materials," he said. "Some of the sermons are based on ideas he was developing as a seminary student. You can really see how they flower later."
He was so impressed by the religious writings, he said, that he and his colleagues at the King Papers Project, which is overseeing a projected 14-volume edition of King's writings, decided to devote a volume to them. 
"There is no question that the collection is enormously valuable in dollar terms," he said. "The best solution would have been to place it at the Library of Congress. In the right climate, private dollars could have been found to place it there. It's still possible."

HEADLINE: New York State Promised $5 Million in Aid 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK HEALY 

 BODY:
President Bush on Saturday granted New York State $5 million in federal aid to help pay emergency overtime costs incurred during the blackout, federal and state officials said yesterday.
 The money, earmarked for "emergency protective measures," will compensate the state and municipalities for all types of public employees who were called in when the lights went off, including police officers and firefighters. 
 Federal and state officials will begin working this week to determine how to distribute the money, said officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
Gov. George E. Pataki, who petitioned the federal government for an emergency declaration on Aug. 15, the day after the blackout left New York and parts of seven other states without power, lauded Mr. Bush's order yesterday.
"While many questions remain unanswered," Mr. Pataki, a Republican, said in the statement, "this federal declaration is welcome news for local governments and taxpayers."
But New York's two United States senators, both Democrats, said that $5 million would not be enough to make up for the economic losses caused by the blackout.
The administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has estimated overtime costs in New York City alone at $5 million to $10 million.
"I'm appreciative that the designation has been made, but the amount is insufficient," Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said yesterday in a telephone interview. "This is a start, but it is woefully inadequate."
Senator Charles E. Schumer voiced similar concerns yesterday at a news conference. The blackout was as significant an emergency in New York, he said, as forest fires have been in the West.
Mr. Schumer called the aid "so inadequate that one doesn't know what to say. Five million dollars isn't going to come close to reimbursing us for our expenses. I hope it isn't a bad April Fools' joke a little bit late."
The city comptroller's office estimated that New York City lost more than $1 billion in the blackout, a figure that included $800 million in lost production of goods and services and $250 million in discarded perishable foods.
The state has yet to calculate its overtime costs or the statewide financial impact of the blackout.
Under federal law, states may receive only $5 million in federal aid for a single emergency unless the president authorizes more. In emergencies, the federal government generally pays 75 percent of a state's total overtime personnel and equipment costs, said James Lee Witt, the director of emergency management during the Clinton administration.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki, Lynn Rasic, said he had not decided whether he would seek more money.

HEADLINE: MEDIA; 
Fox Plays Terminator, Ending Schwarzenegger Movie Puns

BYLINE:  By JIM RUTENBERG 

 BODY:
As the news media's intense interest in the California gubernatorial recall campaign continues, headline writers and television producers are burning through Arnold Schwarzenegger movie puns as quickly as the action-adventure hero kills and maims bad guys. 
 "Total Recall," "The Governator," and "Running Man" are a few of the never-ending examples. A search on Sunday in the Nexis database of articles from major newspaper and television news transcripts found nearly 500 entries with references to Mr. Schwarzenegger and the word Terminator in the prior seven days. Cable news particularly seemed to be having a fun time with it. 
 Now, however, none other than the Fox News Channel -- whose rise to first place in the cable news ratings is attributed in part to its irreverent graphics and packaging -- is leading the charge in saying "Enough."
In a memorandum posted recently in the Fox News computer system, John Moody, a Fox News Channel senior vice president, ordered his staff to avoid Schwarzenegger movie puns. (The memo did not apply to producers behind Fox News's prime-time lineup of opinionated hosts like Bill O'Reilly, a Fox spokesman said.)
"The urge may seem irresistible to play off Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting career," Mr. Moody wrote. "Resist it. Otherwise the effect is often to belittle the candidacy of the front-runner for one of the most important offices in the U.S., and that's not fair and balanced. No more references to 'Conan,' 'Terminator,' and 'Kindergarten Cop' as shorthand for the candidate."
Noting that plenty of guests on Fox News Channel, which is owned by the News Corporation, will make such references anyway, the memo went on to say: "Certainly don't suggest he is part of a 'circus' or lump him in with novelty candidates" like Gary Coleman.
When in doubt, Mr. Moody's guidance was as follows: "Ask yourself if your clever turn of phrase is suggesting that Schwarzenegger's candidacy isn't a serious one. That's exactly the case his political opponents want to press. We need to play it down the middle."
Fox is the only one of the three major cable networks so far to draft such a mandate.
"CNN did not issue any formal guidance," said Christa Robinson, a network spokeswoman. She said executives at CNN, which is owned by AOL Time Warner Inc. had told their employees to avoid referring to Mr. Schwarzenegger, or any other candidate in the race, by only a first name. Otherwise, its production staff has been free to do as it sees fit -- evidenced on Thursday by CNN Headline News's on-screen pun, "The Dominator." 
MSNBC does not have a prohibition, either. One visual last week on MSNBC, which is owned by the Microsoft Corporation and the General Electric Company, the parent of NBC, called him "The Governator."
Sean Walsh, a spokesman for Mr. Schwarzenegger, who is running as a Republican, said Fox's approach to the campaign coverage was appreciated.
"Fox is showing itself to be a very serious news organization," Mr. Walsh said. "If other news organizations want to play these cute little things, people will say, 'Well, you know, that's silly.' People are taking this recall seriously, and they would expect the media to take the election seriously, as well."
Some Democratic opponents of the recall said they took the Fox memo as an indication that Mr. Schwarzenegger was getting favorable treatment from Fox News Channel.
"I would be very interested whether Fox would like to produce the various memos written about the various Democratic candidates running for office -- whether such documents exist," said Chris Lehane, a Democratic consultant to the California Federation of Labor, which is working against the recall.
Fox News executives, who deny any bias, said no other candidates happened to be such overwhelmingly popular actors, so such a memo would not apply to any of the other candidates. And one executive at Fox asked whether its competitors, who it accuses of having liberal biases, would be as freely irreverent with a Democratic celebrity running for office as they have been with Mr. Schwarzenegger (CNN and MSNBC executives said they would).
John J. Stack, the Fox News Channel vice president for news gathering, said of Mr. Schwarzenegger, "People do recognize him from his films, but he is now undertaking a very serious mission and we want people to be told all about it."
Besides, he said, California voters, faced with huge economic problems, are by now becoming bored with the frivolous aspects of the campaign.
"The circus component is starting to subside. People have gotten their yuks about the porn star and the sitcom representative," he said, "but I think people want to get down to dollars and cents."

HEADLINE: Into Space, Without NASA 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: MESQUITE, Tex. 

 BODY:
Russell Blink is squeezing into a spacesuit. It is the real thing, made for Russian astronauts. John Carmack, his fellow dreamer, bought it for $5,000. Like the technologies for making rocket engines that showed up in industrial catalogs, it was, simply, out there.
 "Isn't it amazing what you can get on eBay these days?" Mr. Carmack says with a wicked smile. 
If the past of spaceflight lies with NASA, which is bracing for the Aug. 26 report into the Columbia shuttle disaster, the future of spaceflight may be starting here, in a cluster of office parks east of Dallas near body shops, heavy-equipment rental yards and flooring stores. In a high-ceilinged warehouse, a small group of dedicated hobbyists led by Mr. Carmack, a software millionaire, is trying to build a rocket from largely off-the-shelf components that the members fully expect will take Mr. Blink into space on the cheap. 
Then again, the future may lie in a very different place: a high-tech shop in the Mojave Desert, Scaled Composites, where Burt Rutan, an innovative aviation designer, is putting together his own craft.
Or it could be in any of the other two dozen teams from five countries that are hoping to win the X Prize, a contest whose founders hope will jump-start a private space race and create a space tourism industry. The competition has garnered the interest of space freaks, tech zillionaires like the founder of Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, and more. (Mr. Bezos declined to talk about his space research company, Blue Origin L.L.C., or to say whether he planned to participate in the X Prize competition.) None of the teams seem to be doing things the way that NASA does them, but that's the point -- to get to space in an entirely new way.
For now, only the governments of the United States and Russia launch humans into space; China plans to try later this year. The two space tourists so far have paid millions of dollars to fly on Russian craft. A private space industry would face many roadblocks.
"The environmental impact study is a big, big hassle," Mr. Carmack says, and the Federal Aviation Administration is still trying to determine what kind of process should be used to regulate the flights.
But advocates of space exploration say there has to be an alternative to what they see as the expensive, bureaucratic over-engineering of NASA. The American space agency would create "the plutonium-powered toaster," says Dr. Charles Lurio, a space consultant and advocate.
"There's no question that there are difficulties to be overcome and dangers, but that's why you want to have a bunch of different people try a lot of different things," he said.
The contest is modeled on the Orteig Prize, the competition that led to Charles Lindbergh's transatlantic flight in 1927 with his Spirit of St. Louis. What with inflation and the high cost of shooting things into space, the scale of the new prize is somewhat larger: $10 million to the winner, instead of the Orteig's $25,000.
The connection to the Orteig Prize is important to the creator of the X Prize, Dr. Peter H. Diamandis. "Since the age of 9, I wanted to be an astronaut," he said. "It's all I dream about."
He worked toward his goal, getting degrees in medicine and engineering, as well as certification in fields like aviation and scuba diving. Along the way he realized that only a tiny number of astronaut applicants get the job, and only about half of those chosen get to fly. And even those who fly rarely get many missions. 
So Dr. Diamandis decided to create a new industry in the private sector to send people -- or, as he calls them, "self-launching carbon payloads that come with their own money" -- into space.
"I was convinced that the marketplace was real, that the technology was readily available," he said. "The only thing missing was the vehicles to jump-start the market."
In 1994, a friend and fellow space advocate, Gregg E. Maryniak, gave him a copy of Lindbergh's memoir, "The Spirit of St. Louis." Dr. Diamandis realized that competitions had been an important spur to commercial aviation. The two friends enlisted several other enthusiasts and established the X Prize Foundation in St. Louis, with plans to build a monitoring center in the St. Louis Science Center.
The Lindbergh connection does not stop there. Erik R. Lindbergh, Charles and Anne Lindbergh's grandson, is a trustee and vice president of the foundation. "I kind of got in under the grandfather clause," he said.
Mr. Lindbergh said at first he asked, "Isn't there a better way to spend $10 million on earth?"
But Dr. Diamandis reeled him in. Mr. Lindbergh talked with Dr. Byron Lichtenberg, a former astronaut and a co-founder of the prize, about the "overview effect" astronauts describe in seeing the world all at once, that "it changes them." It could be a powerful experience for a larger group of people.
"I said: 'Oh -- there's something more here. It's not just about money and excitement and sex appeal,' " Mr. Lindbergh said. "There's something much, much bigger here. And that is what got me involved."
Still, fund-raising was slow and the prize money was only secured late last year.
Old NASA hands say it's not quite as easy as it looks to the newcomers.
"We're coming up on 50 years of human spaceflight and we're still learning every day," said Jay Honeycutt, the president of Lockheed Martin Space Operations and a former director of the Kennedy Space Center. "I just hope they all do understand how hard it is." 
Still, he said he loved the idea of the prize. "I think it's dynamite," he said. 
Each team is approaching the prize in its own way. Mr. Rutan's company, Scaled Composites, is the most closely watched. It is Mr. Rutan who designed Voyager, the first airplane to fly around the world without refueling. His X Prize entry has two stages: a sleek, twin-turbojet carrier aircraft, the White Knight, and a second-stage rocket, SpaceShipOne. Some competitors speculate that Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen is backing the project, though neither Mr. Allen's people nor Mr. Rutan's crew is talking. In any case, from his site in the Mojave Desert, Mr. Rutan has already flown the plane that will launch the space vehicle, and this month he did a drop test of the space-going component to show that it could be piloted and landed safely.
Another well-regarded team, Canadian Arrow, fulfills a lifelong dream of its founder, Geoff Sheerin. An industrial designer, Mr. Sheerin is creating a rocket that would make Buck Rogers comfortable. He will launch it on an offshore barge in the Great Lakes system for a straight-up, straight-down flight, and he plans to recover the capsule from the lake. 
Mr. Sheerin said the prize was part of his own business plan to foster space tourism. "We intend to collect the X Prize on the way to becoming the industry," he said.
Since he was a teenager in Niagara Falls, Ontario, he realized it was possible to create rockets that could launch people into space for a reasonable fee. But he found no one willing to finance such a venture.
The X Prize, he said, brought out backers more comfortable with sponsoring a competitor than a business -- adventure capital, as opposed to venture capital, began to flow. "Without the prize there would be no Canadian Arrow," he said.
Backers still take some convincing, however. "There's an initial skepticism," Mr. Sheerin said, "until we show up and they find we're not wearing tinfoil on our heads."
Other groups have decided to make a run at space without participating in the X Prize.
Jeff Greason, the president of Xcor, a California company close by Mr. Rutan's, said the conditions of the X Prize contest weren't compatible with building the vehicle that would lead to commercial spaceflight. 
"We are very focused on getting the cost required to enter the market down as small as possible," he said. "That leads us to a smaller vehicle that will not carry three people." 
He added, "We're not in a rush to be the first to do it; we want to be the first to make real money doing it."
That focus on cost is what could start the next space industry, said Mr. Maryniak, now executive director of the X Prize. Historically, he said: "Space engineers sort of worship at the altar of high performance. In the real world what people have to optimize to is low cost." 
Setting the bar intentionally low should also make a difference, he said. X Prize calls for launching people just over 60 miles high into suborbital space, the middle frontier surpassed early in the American space program. Any passengers would still feel weightless, and the physics of launching to that level is far simpler than those needed to achieve orbital flight, Mr. Maryniak said. "It's possible for modern-day Orvilles and Wilburs to do this task," he said. 
Selecting the teams has been a challenge, Dr. Diamandis said. "I can't tell you the number of e-mails I've gotten that say, 'Forward me a million dollars and I would be pleased to build my antigravity ship and win your X Prize.' " At the same time, he said, "You don't want to turn away those pesky bicycle mechanics from Dayton, Ohio."
What thrills him, Dr. Diamandis said, is that so many people are excited by the competition. "We're allowing people to dream again," he said. 
He does not deny that the endeavor has risks. 
"These are pioneers," he said. "Much of the stagnation in our space program is because of our inability to take risks -- we're not allowed to fail any more. There can't be new frontiers opened without embracing some level of risk."

HEADLINE: A CONVERSATION WITH/Sally Ride; 
Painful Questions From an Ex-Astronaut

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA DREIFUS

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO 

 BODY:
Though she is a true pioneer, Dr. Sally K. Ride, the first American woman in space, strode into a hotel lobby here this month and went unnoticed. Dr. Ride, 52, enjoys going about life with a degree of anonymity. 
 After her flights in 1983 and 1984, Dr. Ride, at the time one of the most famous women on earth, rejected most product endorsements, books and movie offers that came her way. 
 Instead, she was a co-author of several books for children on space and was on the 1986 presidential commission that investigated the Challenger space shuttle disaster. 
In March, Dr. Ride was named to the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, which plans to release its report on the second loss of a shuttle on Aug. 26. Days before the report's release, as she and the commission worked out the last details, she spoke soberly of the lessons learned and apparently forgotten by NASA, of the costly legacy of NASA's "faster, better, cheaper" policy, and of her own feelings toward the shuttle.
With the conclusion of the Columbia inquiry, Dr. Ride, who is on leave as a professor of physics at the University of California at San Diego, is free to focus on her new mission, encouraging girls to become scientists. Her organization, Imaginary Lines in San Diego, organizes science fairs for girls, workshops for teachers and vacation camps where girls learn, as Dr. Ride says, "that science is really cool."

Q. This past February, as we all watched pictures of the Columbia exploding, people asked, "How could this possibly be happening again?" Do you have any answers?

A. We have been asking ourselves the same question. There are many parallels. Not so much between the accidents themselves, but between some of the organizational contributing causes to the accidents. One parallel is that before the Challenger accident there were several shuttle flights where the first stages of the problem were seen.

Q. Are there parallels between the Columbia problem and the famous O-rings, where rubber rings on the Challenger rocket boosters froze, leading to the explosion.

A. Yes, and it was recognized, dealt with in some way. But they never spent the money to do the required engineering tests to understand exactly what was going on. The problem occurred a second time, but Challenger got to orbit fine. Gradually, over the course of several flights, the mindset became: "We've seen this problem before. It didn't cause a catastrophe. It's probably O.K." It was seen as something that should be fixed, eventually.
With Columbia, there was a history of foam coming off the external tank during launch. Each time, it was identified as a problem. But there was never a real significant engineering effort to understand why this was happening, what the potential implications were and what needed to be done to stop it. There was no catastrophic damage the first time, the second time or even the third time. It got to be accepted as almost, "in the family."

Q. What role did the NASA internal culture play in creating some of the conditions that made the two accidents possible?

A. It's another parallel. Before the Challenger accident, engineers who wanted to postpone the shuttle launch were effectively, they felt, required to prove a safety problem. Normally, it's just the reverse.
With Columbia, the foam strike was observed the day after the launch, and a group of engineers was tasked with accessing what damage could result. Again, those engineers found themselves in having to prove that there'd be catastrophic consequences in order to be listened to. Normally, it would be just the opposite. In order to get additional imagery of Columbia so they could determine the damage, they had to prove that there was a very, very serious problem.

Q. NASA never obtained additional photographs of Columbia's damaged area. The leader of its mission management team, Linda Ham, has said that once the foam strike was detected, some of her engineers wanted her to ask the Pentagon to take spy satellite pictures of the shuttle. Because she could not track down who was urging that, she dropped the matter. Was that an adequate response?

A. That's not good enough. One of the responsibilities of a NASA manager is to be inquisitive to a fault. You have to ask and ask and ask. If you think there's any hint of a problem, you have to get to the bottom of it. In my mind, the question was not, Who is asking this question? What the managers needed to be asking is, What are the potential consequences of this foam hit? And tell me now.
There wasn't any of that quality that Mission Control is almost famous for, which is grabbing onto the pants legs of a problem and not letting go until it understands what the problem is and what the implications are. And that didn't happen in this case. The managers, the Mission Management Team and the Mission Evaluation Room, did not grab onto this problem and insist on an answer. It was really quite the opposite. They assumed they knew the answer. They assumed the foam was not going to be a problem. And they were insisting that people disprove the preconception they had.

Q. Since the accident, there has been much talk about the role budget cuts may have played in the tragedy. What could a bigger budget have done about the kind of cultural problems of NASA's workplace that you have just cited?

A. All the money in the world would not have changed the attitude of management we saw. But different budget allocations may have resulted in a stronger safety organization, with members present at all the right meetings. If they had the tools, the trend analysis and the engineering analysis, they might have stood up in these meetings and offered checks and balances. Partly because of funding and priorities, a checks and balances system didn't exist that could have mitigated the problem.
We're hoping that in the future there might be an independent technical organization within NASA with its own resources that will give engineers a venue to help them develop data for their arguments.

Q. Dan Goldin, the NASA administrator from 1992 to 2001, had a mantra, "Faster, better, cheaper." Was that a mistake?

A. "Faster, better, cheaper," when applied to the human space program, was not a productive concept. It was a false economy. It's very difficult to have all three simultaneously. Pick your favorite two. With human space flight, you'd better add the word "safety" in there, too, because if upper management is going "faster, better, cheaper," that percolates down, and it puts the emphasis on meeting schedules and improving the way that you do things and on cost. And over the years, it provides the impression that budget and schedule are the most important things.

Q. The board investigated whether a rescue of the Columbia crew might have been feasible. What's the point to that kind of second guessing?

A. Because as we started to investigate decision making, we were getting a sense that NASA people were wondering: "Why are you asking about this? This doesn't have anything to do with the accident."
We said, "O.K., let's study if a rescue or a repair might have been possible." NASA formed a team to look into it. The scenario that we gave them included a series of events that led to the conclusion on Flight Day 5 that there was catastrophic damage to the wing. Their study showed that it might have been possible to have gotten Atlantis to the launch pad by about Feb. 10 and to keep everyone on Columbia alive until the rescue team reached them.
A lot of things had to go right for that to work. But the study proved it was feasible. This same kind of study could have been done by NASA in time to do it during the mission.

Q. An editorial in The New York Times questioned the value of NASA's emphasis on low Earth-space orbits and the shuttle, which it described as "finicky, complicated, costly vehicles that pose considerable risk to the astronauts." Would you agree?

A. I think your editors were asking if NASA, as structured today, is capable of operating the program we've got and, in particular, an aging space shuttle fleet. The answer is a qualified yes. Counting the Apollo 1 fire, there have been three major NASA accidents, each of them almost a generation apart. The problem is, People forget. The lessons of Challenger, for instance, were on everyone's minds at NASA for several years after that accident. Then some people retired. New people came in. Seventeen years passed. Over the years, a lot of things crept into the system without people's noticing.
The other thing is, You've got to have the perspective that space flight is really risky. Choose your favorite rocket. If it's really good, it fails 2 out of 100 times. If it's not quite as good, it fails 4 out of 100 times. The shuttle launched successfully 112 times and failed twice. That's a very good record for a launch vehicle. That's a bad record for anything that carries people.
I flew the shuttle twice. It got me home twice. I like the shuttle.

Q. What does an astronaut do when she comes back from space?

A. I'm currently on leave from my U.C.S.D. post to start Imaginary Lines. What drove me to start the company was the sense that a lot of the stereotypes about girls and science and math that we all assumed would be gone by now, have not gone away. Eleven-year-old girls still aren't encouraged quite as much as 11-year-old boys about science and math. A girl might still feel negative pressure from her peers if she's the best one in the math class.
Yet, research shows that girls enjoy science as much as boys throughout elementary school. It's in the middle-school years that they start to drift away. And that's partly because of peer pressure.
So some friends and I decided we'd start programs to help girls get through those middle school years with their interest in science intact. And we'd do it by creating programs that girls think are fun -- science festivals, science camps, science clubs -- that girls can go to with their friends, and that will connect them to each other and role models.
We set it up as a business because we thought it was a better way to have an impact quickly. It's no secret that I've been reluctant to use my name for things. I haven't written my memoirs or let the television movie be made about my life. But this is something I'm very willing to put my name behind.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Shares Dip as Analysts Downgrade a Couple of Big Names

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Investors sold stocks yesterday, collecting profits in the absence of major economic and earnings news. Downgradings by brokerage firms accounted for most of the market's more notable activity in an otherwise mundane session.
 Trading was light, and analysts predicted a quiet week as many traders and investors wrap up their summer vacations. 
 "Volume is so low here that you don't want to read too much into it," said Peter Dunay, market strategist at Wall Street Access, a brokerage firm based in New York. 
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 31.23 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 9,317.64, pulled lower in part by downgrading of Caterpillar and Alcoa.
Despite losing 74.81 points Friday, the Dow had a weekly gain of 0.3 percent. On Tuesday last week, the blue chips had a closing high not seen in 14 months.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.01 points yesterday, or 0.1 percent, to 1,764.31. Last week, the Nasdaq reached closing highs not achieved in 16 months.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index eked out a gain of 0.65 yesterday, or 0.1 percent, to close at 993.71.
Analysts have been quick to point out that the market's sell-offs have been minor compared with the strides that the major gauges have made. So far this year, the Nasdaq has surged 32.1 percent, the Dow has gained 11.7 percent and the S.& P. 500 has advanced 12.9 percent.
The market's strength comes from increasingly positive earnings and economic data, a relief to investors after three years of heavy losses on Wall Street.
"The market has done very well year to date," said Matt Brown, head of equity management at Wilmington Trust. "I don't think there is anything I can really point to that would specifically cause the market to drop. I can only attribute it to a summertime slowdown and that the market has done quite well."
Analysts said that yesterday's declines did not indicate that investors were less optimistic about the economy. The market had been expected to pull back after its latest gains.
Caterpillar dropped $2.03, to $69.66, after Legg Mason lowered its rating to hold from buy.
Alcoa fell 34 cents, to $27.79, after Prudential Securities downgraded it to hold from buy.
Wal-Mart Stores advanced 70 cents, to $59.10, after raising its estimate for August sales at stores open for at least a year. The company now sees such sales, known as same-store sales, rising 4 percent to 6 percent compared with last August. Wal-Mart's previous estimate called for same-store sales, the best gauge of a retailer's activity, to increase 3 percent to 5 percent.
Advanced Micro Devices, the chip maker, rose 18 cents, to $10.09, after Soundview Technology raised its rating to outperform from neutral.

Treasury Prices Off
By Bloomberg News
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell for a third day in four in New York, trading on speculation that private and government reports this week will provide evidence that the economy is accelerating.
Traders are betting that the Federal Reserve will raise its target interest rate to stem faster inflation in coming months, diminishing the allure of bonds.
In the fourth quarter, the economy will probably grow at a 3.7 percent annual pace, the fastest rate since 2000, according to the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
"It's hard to escape what looks like upward pressure on interest rates," said John Poole, who manages $12 billion in fixed-income assets at Mellon Private Asset Management in Boston.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 14/32, to a price of 97 25/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.53 percent from 4.47 percent on Friday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond declined 24/32, to 100 31/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.31 percent from 5.26 percent on Friday.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Sees Strong August Sales Growth 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said yesterday that its sales growth in August could be the strongest in more than a year as back-to-school demand proved better than expected.
 The Target Corporation also said sales at its stores open at least a year were "well above" its expectations last week. 
 In a recorded message updating sales in the week ended last Friday, Wal-Mart said it expected August sales at stores that have been open a year to increase in the range of 4 percent to 6 percent, above its earlier forecast for a rise of 3 percent to 5 percent.
"Discretionary spending is looking pretty good, but it's going to take about two more months of same-store sales data to find out if July was unusually strong or part of a trend," said Richard Hastings, chief economist and a retail analyst with the consulting firm Bernard Sands. 
Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville, Ark., said last week that August sales might beat its forecast, helped by strong back-to-school spending. The retailer introduced a new line of Levi's Signature apparel, which lifted back-to-school sales.
Target, in a recorded call released after the markets closed, said same-store sales last week were well above its August forecast, powered by robust sales of toys, pharmacy items, and electronics and entertainment goods at its discount stores. Target is based in Minneapolis.

HEADLINE: Prices Climb Amid Record Sales of Homes 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Sales of previously owned homes rose to a record in July and prices recorded the biggest 12-month gain in almost 23 years, an industry report indicated yesterday. 
 Sales totaled 6.12 million at an annual pace, up 5 percent from June's 5.83 million pace and the third increase in the last four months, the report from the National Association of Realtors said. The increase was spurred by interest rates that in June had fallen to a low point in recent years. Economists had expected a 5.9-million-unit pace of home resales. 
 Mortgage rates have since risen, which may restrain home sales later this year and limit housing's contribution to economic recovery, economists said. While a rise of one percentage point in the average 30-year fixed rate since June may keep sales from strengthening, an accelerating economy will underpin the market for homes. 
"It's likely that we have hit the peak," said Van Davis, president and chief executive of the Century 21 Real Estate Corporation. "The good news is that I don't see a significant slowdown. The economy is picking up, real wages are rising and interest rates are still low, and in that environment," housing will not slump. 
Existing-home sales are typically counted when the transactions close, meaning that the July statistics probably reflected buying decisions made a month or two earlier. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage reached 5.94 percent in July after falling in June to 5.21 percent, the lowest since the big mortgage buyer Freddie Mac started keeping records in 1971. 
The lowest recorded 30-year rate was 5.83 percent in 1965, according to the Federal Housing Finance Board, which has figures back to 1963.
Home buying has related economic benefits, spurring purchases of costly items like furniture and appliances. 
By region, resales rose 7.7 percent in the Northeast, to a 700,000-unit annual pace; 3.9 percent in the Midwest, to a pace of 1.34 million units; 7 percent in the South, to a 2.45-million-unit pace; and 1.9 percent in the West, to a pace of 1.63 million units. 
The median price of a home rose 4.1 percent last month, to $182,100 from $175,000 in June, and more than 12 percent above the levels of July 2002. That was the biggest 12-month increase since November 1980. David Lereah, chief economist at the Realtors' association, said he expected the rise in home prices to slow to a range of 4 percent to 5 percent over the next 12 months. 
The supply of homes available at the current sales pace fell to 4.7 months' worth in July from a 5.1-month supply in June.
Previously owned homes account for 85 percent of the residential real estate market, and new homes the rest. 
The Commerce Department today will release statistics on new-home sales in July. Economists said these sales probably slipped to a 1.15 million annual pace after a record 1.16 million a month earlier.

HEADLINE: Chinese Economy's Underside: Abuse of Migrants 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: HANGZHOU, China 

 BODY:
From his precarious perch 60 feet above morning rush hour, Wang Fulin watched the restless crowd below. Arms were drawing arches in air, he recalled. They wanted a swan dive. People were chanting, "Jump, jump!"
 Enraged and afraid, Mr. Wang had scaled the metal frame of a billboard to call attention to his grievances. It was his first day in this bustling east coast city, his first trip outside his home province in southwest China. He had been neglected, robbed and abused. Now they wanted blood. 
 In the end he does not remember how he slipped. He recalls only waking up in a hospital bed with three cracked ribs, a broken hip and a shattered ego. "I told those people that I'm a good man, not a bad man, that I just needed help," he said. "But I could not believe in anybody, and nobody believed in me." 
The six-story plunge was the coda of a two-day cross-country odyssey, a personal tale of desperation emblematic of the gamble every Chinese migrant worker takes, leaving family behind to live on the fringes of urban society with limited access to housing, education, medical care and the courts.
Migrant workers are China's untouchables. They are assumed to be behind every unsolved crime. They are the yokels on the street corners of every city, barely able to speak Mandarin Chinese, wide-eyed with fascination or fear.
They are also the dark underside of China's economic success, which has been marked by annual growth of 8 percent for more than a decade and exports to the United States growing so fast that they have surpassed Japan's. In general these people are vulnerable, pliable, cheap to employ and easy to suppress.
The migrant workers number well over 100 million, staffing the factories of Asia's export powerhouse. They work long hours in dangerous jobs for low salaries and no benefits. They are barred from forming unions -- the Communist Party allows just one union, its own -- and liable to be fired on a boss's whim.
They would not come to the cities if the opportunities did not outweigh the dangers, and the government has taken steps to stop systematic abuses. Beijing recently abolished a law that allowed the authorities to detain rural workers and send them home without legal proceedings.
Yet even the official news media offer regular examples of their extreme distress. There are migrants who threaten suicide when they are not paid. Some are preyed on by job agents or forced into sex slavery. Migrants say the police often beat them for minor infractions, like forgetting to carry an identity card.
"To them we are nothing," said Wang Xiaozhen, 48, a migrant worker in Hangzhou. "They don't take our lives seriously."
Ms. Wang says she was selling fruit on a sidewalk one day in February when patrolmen approached. She scurried away, knowing officials did not permit vendors there. But she says the patrolmen gave chase and beat her severely, causing nerve damage in her neck and back and making it impossible for her to work.
She now spends her days in a Hangzhou park, lying on a wooden roller bed and begging for change. A Hangzhou police duty officer said he had no knowledge of Ms. Wang or her complaint. He also declined to comment on the case of Wang Fulin, who is not related to Ms. Wang.
It was money that persuaded Mr. Wang to leave his lush but poor mountain village in Guizhou Province and travel 1,250 miles to Hangzhou, near Shanghai. He arranged to take a job making cardboard shipping containers for $72 a month, enough to send cash back to his ailing father and his two young children.
Instead he was caught in a psychological drama worthy of Hitchcock, with clever crooks, derelict police officers and naive miscalculation. Instead of sending money home, he has relied on relatives to raise $1,500 for his medical care, two years' salary at the box factory.
He seemed hale and steady enough before leaving home, relatives said. His sparkling brown eyes, round cheeks and soft lisp make him appear younger than his 30 years. As an only son with a chronically ill father, he tended the family plots alone. He once recruited volunteers to build a five-mile road that eased the isolation of his mountainside hamlet.
This year, though, Mr. Wang needed cash to pay school fees for his 6-year-old son and buy medicine for his father. Mr. Wang's wife left first. She found a job making light-bulb filaments in Hangzhou. She phoned to say a relative had found a job for Mr. Wang nearby.
The day after summer planting was done, he set out, first by foot along the road he built to Nanlong, then by bus to the provincial capital, Guiyang, where he caught the long-haul K-112 train.
It was trying from the start. His $17 ticket was for standing room on the 36-hour trip, and he could not find a spare seat. He was leaning against the bulkhead of car No. 8, around midnight on the second day, when he heard a fellow passenger whisper, "It's about to get crazy."
A group of men with neatly combed hair and leather shoes had begun working their way through the darkened cabin. Mr. Wang watched them pull down bags from the overhead rack and search the contents, pocketing money and valuables.
Soon they spotted Mr. Wang, awake and afraid. They peppered him with questions about where he was from, how much money he was carrying, where he was going. Mr. Wang said he had answered honestly. He was a country boy with very little money. His cousin was meeting him at the Hangzhou station.
"They accused me of hiding wads of cash, maybe inside my pants," Mr. Wang said. "They said I looked like a sly guy." He said he had stripped off his pants to prove he had nothing strapped to his legs. But a man with a mobile phone, the apparent ringleader, kept harassing him.
"He called someone and told them he had a big catch," Mr. Wang recounted. "He said they should meet me at the station -- bring some drugs to knock me out."
If they were trying to frighten him it worked, maybe too well. 
When the conductor announced that the train was nearing Hangzhou, Mr. Wang darted from car to car to find a railroad policeman who was aboard. He found him in the cafe car, chatting with two train workers. Mr. Wang hurriedly explained that bad people were plotting to steal his money. He needed an escort off the train.
The policeman, Mr. Wang said, asked just one question, "How much money do you have?"
Mr. Wang said he was a poor man with nothing. The policeman waved his hand to indicate he had heard enough and walked away. But the rail workers stayed. One grabbed him from behind. The other ordered him to turn his pockets inside out. Mr. Wang said he produced a small wad of bills, his travel money, and put it on the table. A worker pocketed the cash. The two then dragged him to the caboose. A door was flung open. He was cast into a rail yard near the Hangzhou station.
His instinct was to flee. He scampered up the rail yard wall, losing his sandals in the climb. Breathless and barefoot, he had arrived in downtown Hangzhou. Mr. Wang said he had thought of going to the factory where his wife worked. But did not have the exact street address, and he had no money. He thought of finding his cousin at the station but worried that the crooks awaited him there.
A shop owner let him use a phone. He dialed the police emergency number, but in his home province, Guizhou. "I couldn't understand what people were saying in Hangzhou," he explained. The operator notified the Hangzhou police.
An hour later officers went to the store. He told them about the robbers, the uncaring policeman, the thieving train workers. He needed help, money, a phone. The police looked at him skeptically. Maybe they did not understand him, with his Guizhou accent. They told him someone else would come to handle his case.
No one came. He wandered the street, wondering what to do. Then he saw a billboard, an ad for Hangzhou's annual festival on West Lake, hanging prominently over a major boulevard.
"My idea was to go up there and make a scene," Mr. Wang said. "Then I could explain what happened and demand that they contact my family."
He climbed a ladder to the top. To attract attention, he took off his jacket and tossed it down to passers-by. His shirt followed, then his belt. His pants fell to his ankles, so he took them off too. He stood on the billboard in his baby blue skivvies, shouting to people below.
Pedestrians stopped and gawked. Soon, reporters and firefighters were on the scene. "I have parents and children -- I don't want to die," he yelled, according to one local report. But one bystander shouted back, "When you dive, make it a pretty one." Others joined in chorus: "Jump, jump!"
Firefighters tried talking him down, offering food and water. But when several rescue workers began climbing toward him at once, Mr. Wang scrambled to an edge, apparently looking for an escape. Then he tumbled. A hanging roll of canvas beneath the billboard checked his fall. He landed on a patch of grass.
Mr. Wang is now back in Guizhou. His wife, who found out about the accident from a newspaper report, moved him closer to home, where the hospital fees are lower.
He says he has decided that he just had bad luck. The next time he goes to the big city it will be different. And there will be a next time, given that his family, once merely strapped for cash, is now deeply in debt.
"For our kind of people," he said, "there's no other choice.'

HEADLINE: Help Comes to a Riot-Stricken City, but Its Problems Remain 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: BENTON HARBOR, Mich., Aug. 20 

 BODY:
At first glance, the little riot that erupted here this summer after a motorcyclist was killed in a police chase might seem like a long-awaited blessing for this forgotten ghetto tucked among the beach resorts on the southeast shore of Lake Michigan.
 The two months since the two nights of violence that left 12 buildings torched have brought a flood of good-news announcements: $500,000 from the state to create summer jobs for teenagers; the renovation by the Whirlpool Corporation of a decades-empty department store, bringing 150 workers to Main Street; a "professional corner" including the first new building in the dilapidated downtown since 1989; 50 inexpensive homes for poor families; a governor's task force and a broad citizens' group meeting weekly to tackle the intractable. 
 Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm is expected to bring a new bag of goodies when she returns here on Tuesday; the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has marched through town five times this summer, plans to open a satellite of his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition here this fall. 
"Things are really moving; the window's open now," said the Rev. Edward Pinkney of the Black Autonomy Network Community Organization, whose weekly courthouse protest has swelled from its mainstay of 20 to as many as 80 at times this summer. "Nobody got killed. A few houses burned down, but we're going to get 50 new ones. That may not be a bad exchange at all."
Look closer, though, and the changes in this city of 12,000 residents -- 95 percent of them black, 40 percent below the poverty line, one in five unemployed -- might appear cosmetic.
The economic development deals were in the works long before the disturbances; in fact, resentment over the dominance of white contractors in the downtown revival may have helped stoke the outrage. The Youth Works summer jobs grant simply revived a longstanding program that was abandoned in 1998 -- and had slots for only 262 of 640 applicants, for just six weeks. Main Street's few small businesses have been struggling with lower sales since the violence scared customers away.
In the graffiti-stained neighborhood, where ashes from the burned buildings have been covered with sand but the boarded-up houses next door remain hideouts for drug dealers, residents say the only difference is the squeeze from the police. The 12 officers of the Benton Harbor Police Department have been buttressed this summer by 23 state troopers, who locals say endlessly harass motorists and bicyclists, and shoo even adults from streets to stoops before the 10:30 p.m. youth curfew.
"I see no changes -- everybody put on airs," said Linda Briziel, 49, as she took pictures of her grandchildren playing at a picnic organized by a local mental health clinic in response to the riots. "They're going to do everything they can for a while, but it won't do anything. They still going to have the drugs, they still going to have the violence."
The "disturbance," as many here call it, was set off by the June 16 death of Terrance Shurn, a 28-year-old man who was driving without a license and crashed while being chased by the police at speeds that witnesses said topped 100 miles an hour. It was one in a series of ugly, and often fatal, altercations between the poor African-Americans of Benton Harbor and the white officers from neighboring towns like Benton Township and St. Joseph.
The glare of national news coverage embarrassed city leaders at first, but they quickly seized the microphones to lament the horrors that have engulfed their city since it lost 5,000 factory jobs in the mid-1980's. Half the residents lack a high school education. Two-thirds of the men ages 17 to 30 have a felony record. The once-thriving downtown is just 30 percent occupied (up from 10 percent a decade ago), the tax base dry as stone.
The attention undoubtedly generated new energy.
Six banks called Community Housing Initiatives, a nonprofit organization, offering mortgages to low-income buyers that had long been rejected. A languishing ministerial alliance, representing many of the 100 storefront churches crammed into Benton Harbor's four square miles, replaced turf battles with cooperative meetings. Mayor Charles Yarbrough began walking the mile and a half from his home to City Hall, listening to angry residents en route.
"You've got people talking to each other that never talked before," said Mayor Yarbrough, 64, who is running for his second four-year term, after 25 years as a city commissioner.
Jeff Noel, the president of the Cornerstone Alliance, the economic and emotional engine behind most of the city's redevelopment, said, "It's forced people to say, 'Yes, let's get a meeting tomorrow,' instead of next month."
The most obvious bright slivers in the dark clouds are the $5.15-an-hour jobs at 58 area businesses that were doled out by lottery to people ages 14 to 21. Students mowed the lawn at the tiny municipal airport, washed cars at Schroeder Motor Mall, did data entry at Gast Manufacturing and otherwise learned the responsibilities of clock-punching. Several were fired after failing drug tests or just failing to show up, but several others were offered full-time employment this fall.
But if some now have extra money to buy school shoes and books, other residents see the summer jobs as merely a Band-Aid.
"They're making jobs for kids; they should make jobs for grown-ups," said Lisa Callahan, 38, who lives near the riot area, has seven children and has been living on food stamps since she was laid off from a tree nursery in February. 
All the attention in the world does not address the fundamental mismatch between employment-starved residents and companies with job requirements they cannot meet. Most residents lack basic skills; many have criminal records. A ceiling-grate manufacturer brought 100 jobs starting at $13 an hour in 1998; 30 percent of the new hires did not get past a drug screening.
The skills shortage is among the many complex and systemic problems being considered by the governor's 22-member task force, which plans to present a list of priorities on Oct. 15. On Tuesday evening, Richard Pappas, the president of Lake Michigan College, outlined a $140,000, 16-week seminar for 100 adults that would teach reading, math, computer and other job skills.
Dr. Pappas's presentation was sandwiched between one from a group of ministers who want to build 50 houses and one from the police chief, Samuel Harris, who said that he could not pursue community policing because his 12 officers were swamped by 1,200 to 1,600 calls a month, and that turnover was high because Benton Harbor's $13.40-an-hour pay is the lowest in the region.
The question for each was the same: Where would the money come from, in a state with a $2 billion deficit?
The lonely entrepreneurs waiting for customers in the ghostly downtown have similar worries. The doors of the arts district were mostly locked today, and the only place to buy a cup of coffee was at the concession stand of the newly renovated State Theater, whose peak audiences of 300 a weekend dropped to 75 this summer.
At the Sign Shop, which moved here in 1999, sales are off $20,000 from this time last year, a big hit on a total annual take of $130,000. Lashunn Harper, the owner of Dialo's Cafe, has placed a huge marquee on the town green in hopes of luring customers to his empty soul-food storefront around the corner.
"I have a lot of white customers who live in Stevensville, and they were kind of just getting comfortable coming down here," said Mr. Harper, 31, who opened his restaurant three years ago. The disturbance "slowed it down," he said. "They were calling and saying: 'Is it safe to come down there? Can you deliver?' "
The residents of Empire and Pavone Streets, in the neighborhood where the buildings burned, do not attend task force or community meetings. They yearn for the construction jobs downtown, but say those are mostly taken by out-of-towners (though for two of the four houses being built to replace ones that burned, the state housing agency is spending $16,000 extra to hire a Benton Harbor contractor whose bid was not the lowest). They seethe at the state police officers, who they feel are occupying their city.
David Gray, an assistant manager at a furniture rental company in Benton Township, said he had been stopped nearly every day since the riot. Ditto for Charles Patterson, who pulled up on a bike to get a shave at a makeshift barbershop on a friend's front porch, and Jeffrey Sims, who stopped by to gossip.
"You got immediate hush money, that's all it was," Mr. Sims, 36, said of the summer jobs and other new initiatives. "I think it's just a story for the moment. Give it another year, we'll probably fade into experience."
Mr. Patterson scoffed, "Six months."
"Yeah," Mr. Sims agreed. "A year's probably too much."

HEADLINE: Soviet Shadows, Ukrainian Ghosts 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: KARAPCHIV, Ukraine 

 BODY:
I got my car stuck in the mud of a so-called road here. Way back in the 1920's, it was a smooth highway, but it has now disintegrated into a rough path -- and when a bridge collapsed recently, motorists were left to forge through a muddy bog as embracing as quicksand.
 That's the special accomplishment of the former Soviet Union: it not only repressed and impoverished its citizens in its seven decades, but continues to do so today, posthumously. 
 The woes of this little village of Karapchiv are, to me, a particularly poignant window into all that went wrong and still goes wrong in the late U.S.S.R. -- for in an alternate universe, it would have been my home. My father's family, emigre Armenians, lived here in what was then Romania, now a short drive south. Then the Soviets seized this land in 1944 and sent my father fleeing on a long, bumpy journey to Oregon. 
So my heart pulses with competing emotions as I stand in front of the Kristof family home here (actually, it's the Krzysztofowicz family home, for my father shortened the name after arrival in the U.S.). I can't help admiring, even coveting, its long-lost grandeur, but it's also decrepit and sad, uglified in that Communist combination of peeling paint, sagging roofs and gardens gone wild.
The home had plumbing when it was built in 1908, but the pipes have been removed. Now it serves as a village office and as a home for several families, but it has neither a toilet nor an outhouse -- people just disappear into the wooded grounds.
Another family home is now the village school, which is a much better use for it than housing me, and I'm sure the Communists did us a favor by evicting us and pushing us toward America. The old system, in which a few wealthy families like mine exploited vast numbers of peasants, was unsustainable and, frankly, a pretty good argument for Communism.
But Soviet Communism rotted both initiative and pluralism, poisoning the land for the future. Here in Ukraine, the depression after the fall of the Soviet Union lasted for 10 consecutive years of falling G.N.P., resulting in a total economic decline of 59 percent.
Georgia endured an even sharper fall, 78 percent. By comparison, in the Great Depression, the U.S. suffered a 27 percent decline in output.
We in the West cheered when the Soviet Union tottered and died. But we've moved on, while erstwhile Soviet lands remain wretched, with ordinary people commemorating not new freedoms but deaths from AIDS, tuberculosis and drunkenness. Life expectancy has fallen in Ukraine since the heady revolution we applauded.
For its part, Ukraine is now ruled by a thug, Leonid Kuchma, whose opponents have a way of being victimized by mysterious car crashes. Four prominent journalists have died in Ukraine under puzzling circumstances over the last three years, including Georgy Gongadze, whose beheaded body was found after President Kuchma was secretly taped saying of him: "Drive him out. Throw him out. Give him to the Chechens."
(Mr. Kuchma says that the tape recordings were doctored. Washington, outraged by Ukraine's sale of a $100 million radar system to Iraq, has rightly been stern with him, for Ukraine desperately needs better leadership.)
Here in Karapchiv, work is so elusive that it is possible to hire a person for $1 a day. The village's leading entrepreneur, Anatoly Marianchuk, who employs 12 people in his lumber business, complains that the government still strangles businesses with taxes and arbitrary rules.
"The problem is the state," he said. "If you start a new business on paper, then they want to tax you immediately, even before you do anything."
And yet, there are hopeful signs that the worst is over. The depression that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union has ended everywhere, and Russia is now booming along at more than 6 percent this year, Ukraine at almost 5 percent -- both much faster than the U.S. or Western Europe.
Karapchiv has had a building boom for tiny outdoor chapels, a tribute to the new religious freedoms. I stayed on the couch of a villager who,like others, has found construction work abroad, enabling him to afford a solid home, and a light and toilet paper in his outhouse.
And even that road where I got stuck is getting attention. A new bridge is under construction over the mire, so someday Karapchiv may even regain the level it enjoyed in the 1930's -- and rise up from there.

HEADLINE: Congressional Deficit Estimate May Exceed a Half-Trillion 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is likely to forecast a federal budget deficit for next year that is even larger than the Bush administration has predicted, Congressional officials said today.
 Though the budget office is keeping its forecast secret until Tuesday morning, analysts from both political parties used back-of-the-envelope calculations today to suggest that next year's shortfall could easily exceed $500 billion. 
 The White House budget office predicted last month that the deficit in 2004 would reach $475 billion, and its estimate did not include any continued military costs for the American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
The Congressional Budget Office has already alerted lawmakers that it will try two different approaches in estimating those costs, which are currently running at about $4.9 billion a month, just under $60 billion a year.
The first method will assume no special war costs at all, because existing laws make no allowance for spending in Iraq beyond this fiscal year. Nobody suggests that this approach is realistic, but it complies with the Congressional Budget Office's legal requirement to base estimates only on existing laws.
The budget office will also prepare estimates assuming that this year's war costs will continue annually for each of the next 10 years. That would be more realistic for 2004, and Republican officials said it could easily push the estimated deficit in 2004 to more than $500 billion.
But most analysts consider this approach unrealistic for the outlook in the longer term, because costs associated with Iraq and Afghanistan may decline significantly after 2004. It is hard to predict that decline, however.
"People from both political parties are going to look at this and say it isn't accurate," said SeanSpicer, a spokesman for the Republican majority on the House Budget Committee.
The Congressional Budget Office has already noted that about $30 billion that had been appropriated for this year was essentially delayed and pushed into 2004. The effect is to reduce the expected deficit for this year by $30 billion, but then increase it by $30 billion for next year. So the growth in the deficit will appear larger, year to year.
Potentially more important than the deficit projections for this year and next is what the Congressional Budget Office says about long-term spending trends and economic growth.
Republicans, who have become increasingly nervous about the record deficits at a time when their party controls both the White House and Congress, are bracing for the budget office to give them both good and bad news.
The good news is that the office is likely to ratchet up its long-term estimate of productivity growth in the United States. By assuming higher productivity growth than in the past, analysts can also assume slightly higher economic growth and higher tax revenues. 
People close to the budget agency suggest that the productivity increase will be significant, but not overwhelming. 
But Republicans on the House Budget Committee are also bracing for bad news on the short-term economic outlook, expecting the budget office to assume slower economic growth in the months ahead because it made its most recent estimates without considering a flurry of encouraging new data released in the past month.

 BODY:
China's Currency Policy Is Becoming Issue in U.S.
With unemployment high and American manufacturers reeling from three years of misery, politicians and businesspeople have found a villain to blame for these troubles: China, or more specifically its currency.
 The issue is the value of the yuan, which the Beijing government pegs to the dollar rather than allowing it to float in world currency markets. Critics say that keeps the yuan undervalued by as much as 40 percent, enabling Chinese manufacturers to flood the United States with products at prices that homegrown companies cannot match.

 Japan's merchandise trade surplus grew 7.3 percent in July from the month a year ago, helped by a rebound in exports. 
Japan's surplus swelled to 799 billion yen ($6.7 billion yen), smaller than economists had forecast.

 A state hiring freeze in effect for more than five years has been lifted by Gov.

Perry Comeaux, Mr. Guinn's budget director, said the governor made the decision because the budget for the next two years is balanced, the economy appears to have stabilized and the state's revenue projections are conservative.

HEADLINE: An Outsider Candidate Who Favors Insider Advice 

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
Arnold Schwarzenegger bills himself as the Sacramento outsider in the recall race who can bring a new perspective to government. 
 Yet he has surrounded himself with accomplished Sacramento insiders, led by former Gov. Pete Wilson and the inner circle that helped him govern for two terms in the 1990's. 
 Though Mr. Wilson, 70, has taken a quieter role in day-to-day operations as one of the campaign co-chairmen, those close to him say, he wields great influence over the man trying to make the transition from the silver screen to the governor's chair. 
It may have been Mr. Wilson's advice over a two-hour lunch that helped persuade Mr. Schwarzenegger, 56, to jump five days later into the race to recall Gov. Gray Davis. A friend of both men says Mr. Wilson recounted a meal he had with Richard M. Nixon in 1966, when Mr. Wilson was considering stepping into politics. Mr. Nixon gave Mr. Wilson -- as Mr. Wilson gave Mr. Schwarzenegger -- some simple guidance: Don't dither. Opportunity passes you by.
Bill Whalen, a former speechwriter for Mr. Wilson who shares an office with him at the Hoover Institution, a research center at Stanford University, said that when the war horse talks, the novice listens. 
"Pete is older than Arnold," Mr. Whalen said. "He is not star-struck or a toady. He is in a position to explain things to him in a frank way." 
Mr. Wilson has had success. When he took office in 1991, the problems mirrored those today. Jobs were disappearing, and the state budget deficit was $14 billion. When he left office in 1998, the state was running a large surplus and it had recouped the lost jobs. 
But the Wilson team is not without liabilities. It pushed the energy deregulation that lead to rolling blackouts in 2000 that some blame Mr. Davis for. 
And it was Mr. Wilson who let slip on a Sunday morning talk show that Mr. Schwarzenegger, who was born in Austria, had supported Proposition 187, a successful ballot initiative that Mr. Wilson sponsored, barring illegal immigrants from state services. 
The influence of Mr. Wilson, still a polarizing figure in California politics, may not be apparent to voters. The job of articulating Mr. Schwarzenegger's positions is left to two other campaign co-chairmen: Representative David Dreier, a photogenic Southern Californian who once dated Bo Derek, and Abel Maldonado, a Hispanic assemblyman from Santa Maria and a rising Republican star who will be the Schwarzenegger spokesman on immigration should Mr. Davis sign a controversial bill allowing illegal immigrants to obtain drivers licenses. 
Still, Mr. Wilson is the power behind the operation, and Democrats promise to make hay of it in the run-up to the Oct. 7 recall vote. 
"The question is: is Arnold Pete Wilson incarnate or is he the true independent?" says Sheri Annis, a former consultant to Mr. Schwarzenegger and president of Fourth Estate Strategies. "It's best in politics to steer away from those with baggage. But this is a short, short race, and it's hard to know if the public will care. One thing is true, everyone on this team knows the ropes."
As Mr. Schwarzenegger presents himself as a breath of fresh air, Wilson critics wonder if his run is merely a shadow campaign for a Wilson third term. Mr. Wilson has done little to dispel such perceptions. He was asked, before Mr. Schwarzenegger's surprise plunge into the race, why anyone would want the headache of dealing with California's dysfunctional Legislature or its sinking economy.
"I will reveal a deep character flaw," Mr. Wilson said in an interview. "I'm sufficiently masochistic in that I would willingly undertake the challenge of trying to rescue it. Former governors who are term limited are barred."
A certain part of Pete Wilson misses the political game, said Kenneth L. Khachigian, a former strategist to Ronald Reagan who most recently advised Darrell Issa, the San Diego congressman who bankrolled the $2 million recall petition only to drop from the race for governor at the last moment. 
"Pete wants to participate," Mr. Khachigian said. "He cares deeply about this state. For four and a half years, nobody asked his advice, and now his juices are flowing."
Among Mr. Wilson's coterie working on the Schwarzenegger campaign is Bob White, his chief political lieutenant for more than 30 years. Mr. White is regarded as one of the best-connected men in Sacramento, an avuncular figure untainted by scandal. He has been, over the years, Mr. Wilson's fixer, facilitator and schmoozer. Mr. White runs the day-to-day operation of the campaign. George Gorton, who ran Boris Yeltsin's re-election campaign, is Mr. Schwarzenegger's chief strategist. 
The finance and tax advisers were plucked from the Hoover Institution, where Mr. Wilson is a fellow. Among them are George P. Schultz, the former secretary of state; Michael Boskin, former adviser to Mr. Wilson and former chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers; and John Cogan, a deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget under the first President George Bush who is in line to be Mr. Schwarzenegger's independent auditor. 
Patricia Clarey, a former Wilson deputy, manages the logistics. From the East and a graduate of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, Ms. Clarey is said to be the conduit to Mr. Schwarzenegger's wife, Maria Shriver, who holds great influence over him. Sean Walsh, a campaign spokesman, was also employed by Mr. Wilson.
News that the campaign had hired another Wilson associate, Martin Wilson, raised eyebrows. He, along with the advertising guru Don Sipple, were embroiled in an insurance scandal that drove the insurance commissioner, Chuck Quackenbush, from office.
A member of Mr. Wilson's inner circle when he was governor, Martin Wilson, no relation, is co-manager of the day-to-day campaign operations. His consulting firm, Public Strategies Inc., received nearly $400,000 from a foundation set up by Mr. Quackenbush after the Northridge earthquake in 1994.
Instead of paying huge fines, insurance companies accused of mishandling claims were allowed to contribute to foundations ostensibly devised to help earthquake victims. Instead, the foundations spent millions of dollars on television advertisements devoted to enhancing Mr. Quackenbush's political image.
Mr. Sipple, who now produces Mr. Schwarzenegger's commercials, wrote the scripts for the Quackenbush advertisements and was paid $125,000, government records show. Mr. Quackenbush resigned in 2000 rather than face impeachment proceedings. Neither Mr. Wilson nor Mr. Sipple was charged with crimes.
Nevertheless, bad perceptions linger, said Brad Sherman, the Democratic congressman who represents the Northridge area.
"A lot of people feel they got cheated," Mr. Sherman said. "If Schwarzenegger wants to say he is going to clean up special interests, he needs to start with his own staff."
Mr. Sipple, considered one of the most effective advertising people in politics, is best known for his commercial "They Just Keep Coming," which depicted illegal immigrants sneaking into California. It was made in support of Proposition 187, and alienated a large part of the Latino community.
As good as its winning percentage is, the Wilson team has had highly publicized defeats in recent years. Dan Lungren hired some of Mr. Wilson's top media and polling strategists in 1998 in a losing campaign for governor against Mr. Davis. Mr. Sipple was the chief strategist last year for Richard J. Riordan, the former Los Angeles mayor, who lost by 42 points to Bill Simon Jr. in the Republican primary. 
Mr. Gorton played down the controversies involving some in the Wilson camp.
"The public doesn't care about that stuff," he said. "It's too inside baseball."
Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights who supports the recall, says an opportunity is being missed. "The election is shaping up as a runoff between the same political establishment that got us into this mess over the last 10 years," Mr. Rosenfield said. "The Wilson Republicans and the Davis Democrats."
The paradox of the political outsider working with the consummate insiders would be a good backdrop for the next Schwarzenegger movie, Mr. Rosenfield said. "It's the script where the hero gets taken over by the robots he's trying to protect the public from."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 28, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about political veterans who are helping Arnold Schwarzenegger in his campaign for governor of California misspelled the surname of the former secretary of state who is advising him. He is George P. Shultz. The article also misstated the margin by which Richard J. Riordan, whose chief strategist produces Mr. Schwarzenegger's commercials, lost the Republican primary for governor to Bill Simon Jr. last year. It was 18 percentage points, not 42.

HEADLINE: The Currency of China Is Emerging as a Tough Business Issue in the U.S. 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER and EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
With unemployment high and American manufacturers reeling from three years of misery, politicians and businesspeople around the country have found a villain to blame for these troubles: China, or more specifically its currency.
 In South Carolina, the Republican governor, Mark Sanford, cites the currency, the yuan, as posing a major threat to his state's struggling textile industry by making Chinese exports unreasonably cheap. 
 In Erie, Pa., executives and workers at scores of industrial companies are planning a loud protest on Labor Day over "unfair competition" -- and one of the biggest targets will be the seemingly obscure matter of the yuan.
And in Washington, the Bush administration is gearing up to put direct political pressure on China next week when Treasury Secretary John W. Snow makes a highly publicized trip through Asia. The subject was near the top of the agenda when President Bush met with his economic team two weeks ago in Crawford, Tex. 
The issue is the value of the yuan, which the Beijing government pegs to the dollar rather than allowing it to float in world currency markets. Critics say that keeps the yuan undervalued by as much as 40 percent, enabling Chinese manufacturers to flood the United States with products at prices that homegrown companies cannot match.
Though Chinese exports have been growing at the expense of American manufacturing jobs for years, the volume of the complaints has risen with the unemployment rate -- and with the approach of national elections next year. And no matter what it does, the White House is on treacherous ground.
If the administration does not pushChina hard enough, it risks losing crucial support in important electoral districts. But if it pushes too hard, it could alienate China at a time when the United States needs Beijing's help in containing North Korea.
Then there is the risk of alienating American consumers, who benefit from inexpensive Chinese goods. "This is probably the hottest single trade issue," said Representative Phil English, Republican of Pennsylvania and head of the Congressional steel caucus. "I believe the administration would be making a big mistake if it ceded the high ground on this issue to some of Mr. Bush's competitors."
In a blunt letter to President Bush last month, 16 Republican and Democratic senators and representatives complained that China was undercutting American factories by intentionally keeping its currency undervalued.
The lawmakers, from Democrats like Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York to Republicans like Mr. English and Senator Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina, demanded that Mr. Bush press China to adopt a free-floating currency and to let the yuan rise in value.
"The fragile coalition for free trade is weakening because of the huge loss of manufacturing jobs in most parts of the country," Senator Schumer said. "Correcting the exchange rate with China is the perfect way to stem some loss of jobs without violating international trade rules."
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, signed the letter and has made the issue part of his presidential campaign platform.
An undervalued currency makes a country's exports cheaper than they might otherwise be, which in turn puts increased pressure on companies in countries with stronger currencies.
During Mr. Snow's two days of meetings next week, administration officials say he will urge China's leaders to rethink their long-held policy of locking the yuan at a fixed exchange rate of 8.28 to the dollar. 
Still, the administration is reluctant to anger China. For one thing, the United States will commence six-country talks in Beijing on Wednesday over how to deal with North Korea's nuclear program.
Beyond that, administration officials say the economics are far more complex than they first appear. 
Some are worried that an abrupt rise in China's currency might set off a deflationary spiral there that would imperil China's troubled banking system. China's central bank announced today that to shore up its system it would raise the level of deposits required of commercial banks.
Administration officials also note that China is one of few engines in the world economy that is still running at top speed. Putting a brake on that engine could create as many problems as it solves. And they know that a jump in the yuan would lead to unpleasant price increases on everything from clothing to household appliances in the United States.
As a result, administration officials are moving more cautiously than many manufacturers would like. The message to China "will be explicit" that flexibility would be in China's self-interest and "very clear," a senior administration official said today. But the message will be diplomatic. 
For the last nine years, China has maintained the yuan's exchange rate against the dollar by buying or selling dollars when necessary, a policy aided by the fact that China has much stricter currency controls than most countries. Consequently, the yuan has moved in lock step with the dollar, even though China's trade surplus and its foreign reserves have grown enormously. 
Defenders of China's policy note that it has at least been consistent. The yuan rose in line with the dollar during the late 1990's, even after other countries drastically devalued their currencies amid the Asian financial crisis.
The International Monetary Fund has been watching the issue, and officials said today that they also believed that China should show "greater flexibility" toward its exchange rate. 
But Beijing has made it clear that it will make only token gestures to the administration. At most, Chinese officials may offer Mr. Snow a loosening of some currency controls or a promise to begin a formal examination of its policies.
That seems unlikely to damp the rising anger in America's industrial heartland.
Governor Sanford of South Carolina and Jennifer M. Granholm, the Democratic governor of Michigan, both said that the exchange rate had become an issue in their states.
"In the Textile Belt, there are a number of governors who are acutely aware of the problem," Mr. Sanford said in an interview. "But our ability to impact currency rates halfway across the globe is frankly nonexistent."
For her part, Governor Granholm said that the issue was so important to retaining manufacturing jobs in her state that she would make it one of the litmus tests as she decides which candidate to endorse in the Democratic presidential primary.
C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said that the domestic pressure against Chinese imports would only increase.
"If nothing is done, you could get an outbreak of protectionism here against China," Mr. Bergsten said in an interview. 
Few American consumers have been oblivious to the increasing ubiquity of "Made in China" labels. The trade deficit with China has exploded to over $100 billion, thanks to market-opening trade agreements and to China's seemingly limitless supply of extremely low-wage workers, in addition to the role of the yuan.
Chinese exports to the United States have doubled to $125 billion in 2002 from $62 billion in 1997.
American exports to China, by contrast, have crept up only modestly over the same period, to $19 billion from $13 billion. 
Phil Tredway, president and owner of Erie Molded Plastics Inc. in Erie, Pa., is among the many manufacturers bitterly complaining about Chinese exchange rates.
"Our customers have a market without borders and sourcing without borders, and we know that," Mr. Tredway said today. "We can compete against China's low labor costs, and we can compete with them if they play by the rules. But we cannot compete with them if they have a 20 percent to 40 percent currency advantage."
At Erie Molded Plastics, a 21-year-old business that makes products like electrical connectors and plastic bottle caps, sales have plunged 20 percent in the last three years, to about $8 million. 
"I'm a Republican and a strong supporter of President Bush," Mr. Tredway said. "But the administration doesn't have any idea how many jobs have been lost because of this."
But international brow-beating over exchange rates can be risky and dangerous for all countries concerned. Charlene Barshefsky, who was the United States trade representative under President Bill Clinton, said that China's exchange rate was a legitimate issue, but she warned against formal accusations of unfair trade practices.
"These trade actions are very costly to bring and success is not assured," she said. "The U.S. is now getting as good as it gets and has become the most prominent country against which antidumping rules are brought, to the detriment of our exporters." 
Regardless of the risks, manufacturers are planning to force the issue as the presidential and Congressional election campaigns intensify. 
Ernest H. Preeg of the Manufacturers Alliance, a business-supported policy research group, made it clear that many companies are disgruntled with the administration on this issue.
"Manufacturers are not going to let the administration fudge the issue," he said. "Just when we're getting hit by the recession, we're getting clobbered by currency manipulation. That's unfair."

HEADLINE: Yale Workers Plan Strike for the Opening of a New Semester 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Thousands of Yale undergraduates are to arrive on campus tomorrow, only to be greeted by an unwelcome but all-too-familiar sight: the ninth labor walkout at Yale in 35 years.
 The open-ended strike by janitorial, dining hall and clerical workers is timed to maximize pressure on Yale officials, who insist that a walkout is misguided because, they say, the university has made an unusually generous contract offer. 
 Yale says it has offered the university's largest union, representing 2,900 clerical workers, raises of 44 percent over the life of a six-year agreement, including immediate raises of 14 percent.
But the clerical union and the union representing 1,100 janitorial, maintenance and dining-hall workers say that the university's offer would leave wages well below those of Harvard's workers and would leave pensions so paltry that many retirees would feel pressured to return to work. 
John W. Wilhelm, president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union, the parent of Yale's two main unions, said he would call off the strike if the university agreed to binding arbitration to settle the dispute.
Mr. Wilhelm angrily criticized the university for rejecting arbitration and for hardly budging in negotiations this week.
"Of all the strikes we ever had at Yale, this is the most unnecessary," said Mr. Wilhelm, a 1967 Yale graduate. "That they won't negotiate and won't accept binding arbitration is the height of irresponsibility."
The unions have been without a contract since January 2002. They held a one-week strike last March.
Yale's unions received some support yesterday from Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat and presidential candidate and a graduate of Yale College and Law School.
"You're not asking for a lot," he said, appearing alongside union leaders in New Haven. "You're not asking for a fortune, Lord knows."
Standing behind a sign that said, "Break the Cycle of Strikes," Mr. Lieberman added: "I appeal to the leadership of this great university to do what is right, do what is consistent with what you've taught me and generations of others about service and fairness and justice. Don't let there be a strike."
Tom Conroy, a Yale spokesman, said the union was calling a strike at an unfortunate time.
"We regret that the unions have called for a strike," he said. "We don't believe that any disinterested party would look at Yale's offer and conclude that a strike made sense."
He reiterated the university's long-held position against binding arbitration. "The university and the unions should be the ones to agree to what the contract will contain rather than have a third party impose it on us," he said.
Responding to the senator's comments, Mr. Conroy said, "I didn't hear any endorsement from Senator Lieberman of the union's contract proposal as opposed to the university's."
Last Thursday, Yale's president, Richard C. Levin, sent a long letter to the students, faculty, alumni and unionized employees saying that he had tried to improve Yale's rancorous labor relations, widely considered the worst of any university's in the nation. He also insisted that Yale had made a generous proposal, offering raises well above inflation as well as unusual job security provisions.
Dr. Levin's letter discussed pensions at length, largely because that is the most hotly contested issue in the dispute. He said that Yale's proposal would increase pensions 23 to 31 percent and that for employees retiring with 30 years of service at age 65 or older, their after-tax retirement income from their pension and Social Security would be more than 83 percent of their final after-tax salary.
"At a time when employers throughout the nation are seeking givebacks, the university has offered to continue its entire package of benefits," Dr. Levin wrote.
Mr. Wilhelm insisted that Yale's assertions about pensions were distorted because they focused on employees who spent their whole work lives at Yale and who turned down survivor benefits for spouses.
"What they say demonstrates the saying that figures lie and liars figure," Mr. Wilhelm said. "The actual average monthly pension of members of our union who retired from Yale in 2002 with 20 years' service or more is just $621 a month."
The two sides also clashed in comparing workers' pay at Yale and Harvard.
The unions put together a study showing that Yale workers often received 20 percent less, while a consultant hired by Yale, Hewitt Associates, did a study showing that Yale's workers generally earned more than Harvard's after accounting for the higher cost of living around Boston.
Yale said that the average annual pay for its janitorial, maintenance and dining-hall workers was $30,000 and the average for its clerical workers, $33,000.

HEADLINE: Pataki's Losses Mount Amid Refinancing Fight 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
A bruising summer-long bout that could be titled State vs. City is continuing in the court's Appellate Division this week, with Gov. George E. Pataki fighting as hard as ever to block a deal that could save the city $500 million a year.
 With a failed lower court decision behind him, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and state legislative leaders locked in alliance against him, and a broad swath of public opinion siding with the city, Mr. Pataki is nonetheless sticking to his fiscal cause. 
 Last week, a day after his loss in State Supreme Court in the opening round of the legal fight, he restated his opposition to the Legislature's plan to allow the city to refinance $2.5 billion worth of debt left over from the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, with the state paying back the new long-term loan. 
"Thirty years from now, people not yet born will be paying taxes to pay off an operating debt incurred in 1975," Mr. Pataki said at an appearance on Long Island last week. "That's not right, and not only is it not right, we think it was done in a way that is illegal. We're going to fight for the taxpayers."
His aides and allies say the governor believes that the cost of the refinancing plan, $5.1 billion over 30 years, is too much for state taxpayers to pay, and that there are other ways to help the city. 
Lisa Dewald Stoll, his communications director, portrays him as a fiscally conservative Republican who cares more about principles than political wins and losses.
"New Yorkers know and trust Governor Pataki to do the right thing," Ms. Stoll said. "It's not about politics, it's about good government, and in the end good government is good politics."
Yet many political strategists and politicians say Mr. Pataki is also in it for the victory, something that has been lacking from his resume in the last few months.
The governor, they say, is still reeling from a setback in the spring, when Republicans and Democrats in the Legislature teamed up to steamroll him on the budget. The legislators also joined forces with Mr. Bloomberg to push through the bill giving the city fiscal relief.
Earlier this year, the Republican mayor won both in substance and on the public relations front as Mr. Pataki tried a last-minute maneuver to influence the split between the state and city of federal aid for antiterrorism preparedness.
This summer, one of Mr. Pataki's major public policy initiatives, reforming the state's drug sentencing laws, ended with a string of embarrassing headlines over the role of a hip-hip impresario whom he invited to join the legislative talks.
At least for the moment, Mr. Bloomberg seems to have gained the upper hand in the court fight over the bond refinancing plan. 
At the same time, the governor's energy policies have been called into question by Democrats, who have used the blackout as an excuse to hold hearings on deregulation.
The setbacks are all the more startling because Mr. Pataki was once such a dominating part of state politics that there was little he could not get through the Legislature or force to come to fruition through administrative acts.
One reason for Mr. Pataki's glide through his first two terms was the wave of economic prosperity he was riding. That changed this year, as the state faced an $11.5 billion budget gap, and can look forward to an estimated gap of $5.3 billion next year. 
Despite Mr. Pataki's insistence that the gap should be closed without raising taxes -- a position that many legislators saw as his bid to tack back to the conservative wing of his party -- the Legislature passed a budget that raised taxes and kept cuts to a minimum, and offered the bond deal to the city. It then overrode Mr. Pataki's vetoes of the bills.
Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant, said Mr. Pataki was known as a smart, crafty and clever politician. But he said the state's precarious fiscal situation continued to pose a big risk for Mr. Pataki, even as he casts himself as "defender of the pocketbook."
"Should the economy really take on a resurgence, the debt problem will start to disintegrate over time, he'll look like he's more in control, more of a winner, and he'll go out as a winner," Mr. Sheinkopf said. "But if the state's fiscal crisis and the city's fiscal crisis continue, and the economy doesn't pick up, it's hard to foresee a circumstance under which he walks out with tremendous favorables, as defined by the voters."
Supporters and opponents alike say Mr. Pataki is a natural political powerhouse in a state where the gubernatorial office comes with much intrinsic muscle. He has repeatedly won landslides for a Republican, a rare feat in a Democratic state, and is said to be most dangerous when he is underestimated.
"I feel like what I'm doing is I'm having a conversation where somebody is saying to me, 'Hey, it looks like this year Barry Bonds is only going to hit 50 home runs, what do you think is wrong with him?' " a Republican strategist close to the governor said last week.
But third terms can be difficult for governors if the economy is sour, said Mario M. Cuomo, who lost to Mr. Pataki after serving three terms. At the same time, Mr. Pataki has lost some of his longtime senior aides to the private sector, among them his chief counsel, James M. McGuire, and his communications director, Michael McKeon.
Many people on both sides of the political aisle have wondered if the loss of these and other strategists has led to some political missteps on the governor's part -- for example, entering the fray over funding for antiterrorism efforts too late to make a difference, and generating unnecessary ill will over a water filtration plant in the Bronx by trying late in the game to dictate terms of the deal to the city. 
Others point out that Mr. Pataki vetoed the deal to refinance the city bonds in May, but waited until August to block it through the obscure Local Government Assistance Corporation, which he controls.
"Best guess is he is trying to somehow portray to somebody, somewhere, that he is trying to do the responsible thing against those bad guys, those legislators, those big city mayors," one legislative official said. The official added, "I don't know if he needs a win or he just needs to show he's standing up, standing up for principle here, fight the good fight, even if he loses."
Mr. Cuomo said Mr. Pataki's fights with the mayor and Legislature may have left some city residents with the impression that the governor was reluctant to help them in meaningful ways. Nonetheless, Mr. Cuomo said, Mr. Pataki seems to be in pretty good political standing, considering the state's fiscal circumstances.
Indeed, if history is a guide, Mr. Pataki will be able to deflect much of the criticism now plaguing him. And, in recent weeks, he seems to be working hard at that, traveling the state, campaign style, and doling out fiscal goodies to communities in distress. Yesterday he was in Mount Vernon, announcing grants for housing.
The Republican strategist close to Mr. Pataki said most of the issues making headlines today would either be forgotten or deemed too arcane for the average voter to understand or care about in 2006, the end of his third term.
Mr. Pataki's national image is still in good shape, the strategist said, pointing out that in his view, Mr. Pataki has weathered budget problems better than other governors, notably Gray Davis of California.
"If the political fight were to erupt, and I've got Pataki, I feel like I am going to win," the strategist said. "I still got hands to go beat somebody up with Pataki. He's a great political instrument still. He's a strong guy. He could still win a fight."

HEADLINE: Tangled Up in Blue As Wild Berries Outgrow Demand 

BYLINE:  By NORMAN VANAMEE

DATELINE: MILBRIDGE, Me. 

 BODY:
"WE made blueberry gel nuggets and tried putting them into bagels, but they liquefied in the toaster." Ed Flanagan, president and chief executive of Jasper Wyman & Son, was having lunch in the backroom of the Red Barn Restaurant and reminiscing over past sales schemes. "Then we tried making blueberry candies, but chickened out when we realized we'd be going up against the big confectioners," he declared, taking a swig of blueberry juice. "Have you heard that the University of Maine is looking into adding blueberries to hamburgers," he said somewhat hopefully. "All it takes is one good idea." 
 If ever an industry needed a eureka moment, it is the wild-blueberry business. After two decades of technological breakthroughs, growers in Maine and Canada have suddenly found themselves with an excess of fruit. Bumper harvests in 2000 and 2001 sent wholesale prices through the floor. Last year Maine growers received 25 cents a pound for their fruit, a 17-year low. Companies like Wyman, plus hundreds of small family-run operations across this rugged section of northeastern Maine, have been scrambling ever since to find new customers for their fragile crop. 
 Wild blueberries are smaller and noticeably tastier cousins of the marble-size behemoths grown throughout the country and sold in grocery stores. It is difficult to describe their flavor because no two handfuls taste exactly the same. Unlike cultivated blueberries, a field of the wild crop contains dozens of slightly different plant varieties, called clones, which produce distinctly shaped and flavored berries. Part of the fun is noticing how one batch is impossibly sweet, the next tart and spicy.
Long before settlers arrived, American Indians migrated here to pick the fruit for food and medicine. In the 1800's, local fish canners like Jasper Wyman canned the berries and shipped them around the country. Now international agricultural corporations have moved in, bringing modern farming techniques and mechanical harvesters. 
The delicate, thin-skinned crop doesn't transport well when fresh. The harvest is only four weeks long, and unless the fruit is brought in perfectly dry and meticulously sorted, the tiny berries begin to bruise and become slimy after only a few days in a box. Fresh berries can be found at roadside stands throughout Maine and occasionally in stores in the Northeast, but most are frozen, canned or dried and sold to grocery stores and companies like Sara Lee for pie fillings and muffin and pancake mixes. (Weather permitting, Whole Foods in New York City will stock fresh berries through the first week of September.)
For years, blueberry farmers took a laissez-faire approach to growing. The plants seed themselves and farmers burned the fields every few years to kill weeds and insects and to prune the hardy plants back to their roots. In the last few decades, farming has become more active. "Nowadays, we irrigate, fertilize, spray, mow, pollinate and burn," said Darrell Newell, manager of the Northeastern Blueberry Company, an 1,800-acre farm owned by the Passamaquoddy tribe of Maine. "With all the things we do to them, it's a miracle anything grows here at all." 
But grow they do. Maine's output has tripled in three decades to a yield of 65 million pounds a year. Canadian growers have seen similar increases. 
"It's the age-old story," Mr. Flanagan said. "When something gets going good, farmers can grow things a lot faster than they can grow demand." Around 70 percent of Wyman's berries are sold to the ingredient industry, but Mr. Flanagan is working hard to woo new customers. With a recent study from Tufts University showing blueberries are high in antioxidants, the company is marketing them as a health food. The company has created a new line of juices and a resealable bag to make frozen berries easy to snack. All its blueberry products now have the tagline: No. 1 Antioxidant Fruit. 
Some companies have decided the new marketing is not enough and are trimming costs by using mechanical harvesters. Until recently, all harvesting was done by hand. In an area with limited economic opportunities, blueberry picking provides essential seasonal employment. It is also tremendously hard. Laborers spend the day stooped over ankle-high bushes pulling metal rakes through tangled branches. The teeth are close enough to catch the berries, but it takes a careful teasing movement to get them off without breaking their skin. Temperatures can climb into the 90's, and the air is often abuzz with mosquitoes. Still, rakers are passionate about the work.
The Passamaquoddy, who bought Northeastern Blueberry in 1980 with money the tribe won in a land settlement with the state of Maine, have vowed never to use mechanical harvesters. "Picking blueberries is part of our heritage," Mr. Newell said. 
"It gets into your blood when you're young," Allison Bernard Jr., 37, a member of the Micmac tribe from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, declared. Standing with his son, Ashton, 13, Mr. Bernard created a yard-wide swath through the blue fields with a huge harvesting tool he had welded out of two rakes. Mr. Bernard and the 100-member crew he organized, mostly from tribe members, work from dawn to dusk and spend nights at one of Northeastern's campgrounds. "It's really a social thing," he said. "An opportunity to spend time with other people from the nation." 
But local interest has waned, and now many of Wyman's rakers are migrant laborers from Mexico and Honduras. 
That's a shame, said Dell Emerson, 68, of Columbia Falls, the owner of a small farm called Wild Wescogus Blueberries and manager of the University of Maine's blueberry research station. "When I was a child," Mr. Emerson said, "we'd all go up and spend the month camping out on the barrens," where the fruit grow. "It was really fun."
Like Ed Flanagan at Wyman, Mr. Emerson has been thinking of ways to sell blueberries. From a 25-foot-tall dome structure on U.S. 1, called Wild Blueberry Land, Mr. Emerson and his wife, Marie, sell fresh blueberries and all manner of concoctions, including pleasingly tart blueberry vinegar and blueberry wine jelly with a hefty boozy aroma and subtle bite. The word eureka comes to mind.

HEADLINE: The Price of Not Keeping the Peace 

BYLINE:  By Arthur Hertzberg; Arthur Hertzberg, visiting professor of the humanities at New York University, is author of the forthcoming "The Fate of Zionism."

 BODY:
The cycle of violence that is once again gripping the Middle East presents the United States with another setback in its role as regional peace broker. Never has it become more clear that diplomacy alone cannot secure a workable truce between the Israelis and Palestinians. No resolution of the conflict is possible unless the United States pressures the two parties to make concessions that they have refused for decades to make. But what tools can Washington use? What if angry combatants on both sides decide that it is in their interests to continue to fight?
 The United States does have the means to impose its will, but we must put limits on what we should and should not do. Our government should not put troops on the ground to hound those who send suicide bombers into Israel, or to dismantle Jewish settlements in the West Bank. We would be playing the unsuccessful role of the British in the 1930's and 1940's as the conflict between the Jews and the Palestinians became ever bloodier. Yet, peace plans, of which President Bush's road map is the latest example, can only work if the power of the United States is behind them; otherwise they are merely part of the ongoing theater of the peace process. 
 The most effective way to force a reduction of the violence on both sides is to take punitive economic measures. The United States finances about $4 billion a year, on average, of Israel's national budget. The continuing effort to defend, support and increase settlements in the West Bank and Gaza costs at least $1 billion a year. The money spent annually in directly subsidizing the existing settlements was estimated in 2001 at $400 million.
An American government that was resolved to stop expansion of the settlements would not need to keep sending the secretary of state to Jerusalem to repeat that we really mean what we say. We could prove it by deducting the total cost of the settlements each year from the United States' annual allocation to Israel. To show that we were not being unfeelingly mean, the United States should add that we would hold $1 billion a year in escrow to help those settlers who would peacefully move back into Israel's pre-1967 borders.
No doubt there would be an outcry among some supporters of Israel, especially the ultranationalists, whose goal is to realize their vision of the "undivided land of Israel." But an American government that had the courage to force the end of settlement activity would find far greater support among Jews both in Israel and in the United States than many people in Washington imagine.
Much of this support is because of the pressing matter of demographics in the "undivided land of Israel." Between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River, the total population is now more than 40 percent Arab. Since the Arab birthrate is far higher than the Jewish (by a ratio of more than two to one), there will be an Arab majority in at most 20 years. At that point, Israel will effectively be a binational state. It will have to make a fateful choice between being a democracy that will empower the Arab majority to dominate its government or to subject the Palestinian Arabs to a rule resembling apartheid in South Africa.
The hard-liners in Israel and their supporters abroad avoid this prospect by talking about the "transfer" of population or of making life so difficult that the Palestinians would choose to leave. This is nonsense. Life has been difficult for the Palestinians for several decades, but they have not gone away in large numbers. 
The mainstream in Israel and in the Jewish Diaspora will be grateful to America for saving Israel from itself. The United States government must act with comparable tough love toward the Palestinians. No Israeli government, whichever party might constitute it, can put up with the defiance of the Palestinian militants who keep reiterating that their ultimate aim is to push the Jews into the sea. 
Yet the United States cannot replace Israel in the day-to-day battle with the enemies of peace. We cannot police the territories, for that task might become endless. What American influence can achieve is to dry up the financial and military support of the Palestinian war-makers. A good first step came on Friday, when President Bush ordered the Treasury Department to block the assets of the leaders of the militant Palestinian group Hamas and the charities that officials say help finance it. The group had claimed responsibility for a bus bomb a few days before that killed 21 people in Jerusalem.
But the United States can do more. It is within our power to insist that other countries -- both our allies and enemies -- freeze the financial accounts of militant groups and to demand that they also cease supplying the most violent Palestinian factions with weapons. 
If this does not work, there is no choice but to cut off all but the most basic humanitarian help that the United States, along with many other nations, is giving to the Palestinians. It will surely be an unpopular move, as we are certain to hear statements of compassion from those speaking out in the cause of human rights. But Israelis, too, have the right to ride in a bus or go to a cafe without endangering their lives. 
In the end, the anger at these tough measures will fade. The Palestinians will be left with their real problem: how to find work and living wages in a region that is economically depressed. And the two sides will have a common cause, to find ways of helping each other wage peace.
The United States must act now to disarm each side of the nasty things that they can do to each other. We must end the threat of the settlements to a Palestinian state of the future. The Palestinian militants must be forced to stop threatening the lives of Israelis, wherever they may be. A grand settlement is not in sight, but the United States can lead both parties to a more livable, untidy accommodation.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET-- New Jersey; 
As Factory Jobs Vanish, There's Value in Buildings

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
Nearly a third of New Jersey's manufacturing jobs have disappeared since 1990, leaving thousands in need of jobs and numerous old factory buildings in search of new uses if they are to be productive again.
 Many were simply torn down and replaced. "It mostly doesn't pay to try to convert old manufacturing buildings," said Stanley B. Danzig, a broker of industrial space for Cushman & Wakefield. Mr. Danzig cited a former plant in Cranbury, N.J., that he tried to market for a year as suitable for retrofitting as a warehouse and distribution center. 
 "It turned out its greatest value was for the land -- knockdown and redevelopment," said Mr. Danzig, who eventually brokered a pending sale to a company that plans to build new warehouse buildings on the site. 
There is a niche in making a research and development lab out of a candy factory or a textile warehouse out of a plant where submarine engines had been built. Mindy Lissner, a CB Richard Ellis broker, engineered two such deals in the last year, and about 20 "adaptive reuse" transactions in the last two years. 
During that time, the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University reported, there was a continued "severe, absolute and relative decline" of the role of manufacturing in the state's economy. Manufacturing accounted for slightly more than 9 percent of jobs in 2002, and 8.8 percent at midyear 2003. 
"New Jersey real estate is valuable regardless," Ms. Lissner said. "Any sort of company looking for a cheaper alternative can find possibilities with these tired, worn old buildings."
She and other brokers acknowledged that the loss of jobs hurts both the workers involved and the general economy. "The worst thing about marketing," Ms. Lissner said, "is you go into these buildings to assess their value while people are still working -- and you feel like the Grim Reaper. I remember walking around the General Dynamics building in Woodbridge, where there were 800 people working at one time, and everyone looks at you like, 'What's going on?' "
Ms. Lissner is part of a special properties group within CB Richard Ellis, which she described as "brokers around the country that concentrate on selling large manufacturing buildings in exurban areas -- which basically means the middle of nowhere." New Jersey is different, she said, because the population density is so great and the industrial market so busy. The average price of industrial real estate in the state is $35 to $40 a square foot, Ms. Lissner said, while in states like Georgia, Tennessee and Nebraska, it is $8 to $12. 
But the challenges and opportunities can seem similar: A 428,000-square-foot factory in Canton, Ga., where refrigerators were made, was recently sold to investors, who added loading docks and turned the building into a distribution center. The million-square-foot Electrolux plant in Edison, N.J., where air-conditioners have long been assembled, is not yet fully shut but is under contract for sale to the AMB Property Corporation, which plans to turn it into a distribution center.
Often, major renovations are needed, another broker, Jonathan M. Glick of Sheldon Gross Realty, indicated. He mentioned the purchase of a former steel manufacturing plant in North Brunswick, N.J., that was divided for warehouse space now used by seven companies.
"The cost of transformation had to be pretty high, but it was worth it," Mr. Glick said. Companies that locate in rehabilitated factories may not get all the latest bells and whistles of warehouse design, he said, but "they don't have to rely on some truck stuck on the Cross-Bronx Expressway for 10 hours to get their goods delivered, either."
Ms. Lissner said that one company's throwaway building can be another's castle. "For users out of Brooklyn and Staten Island who may be working on the sixth floor of a loft building, with the truck always double-parked out on the street," she said, to get a free-standing building "is a dream come true." She cited the conversion into a textile warehouse of a 398,000-square-foot building in Woodbridge where submarine engines were once manufactured as part of the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics. 
The former Hershey Foods plant in New Brunswick, where Chuckles, Jujubes and Gummi Bears were once made, had only 14-foot ceilings, and was broken up into many small rooms, Ms. Lissner said. It was purchased by a generic-drug maker, Ohm Laboratories, a unit of Ranbaxy Laboratories of India, to be lab and office space, and required considerable renovation. "But it works for them," she said, "and the building is still working. I call that a happy ending."

HEADLINE: Japan Is Spending Heavily to Pursue a Weak-Yen Policy 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The Japanese government is defying the logic of the foreign exchange market by keeping the yen from rising sharply in value against the dollar.
 The dollar has had a lot going against it this year, including strong doubts about the strength of the economic recovery, the lowest interest rates in 45 years and the war in Iraq and its aftermath. But while these concerns helped send the euro and other major currencies much higher against the dollar, the yen has not even left the launching pad. 
 By spending trillions of yen to buy dollars in the foreign exchange market, Japan has limited the yen's rise against the dollar this year to no more than 2.3 percent, while the euro has jumped as much as 13.5 percent. The yen is now up just 1.3 percent against the dollar while the euro is up 3.8 percent, almost three times as much. 
Japan's success in keeping the yen from gaining significant strength against the dollar -- and other currencies -- is helping the country's economy rebound by keeping its exports more competitive abroad. But, at the same time, it is a drag on American economic growth and is making it more difficult for the United States to reduce its troublesome current account deficit, which is now over $500 billion.
While Japan is one of the world's major industrial economies, the government's effort to manage the value of its currency is more reminiscent of a developing economy like China, which pegs its currency to the value of the dollar.
"The yen is a one-sided floating currency," said David Gilmore, a partner in Foreign Exchange Analytics. "It can only float lower."
C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said a former top Japanese finance official had told him that without the government's intervention, the exchange rate would be around 105 yen to the dollar, which would make the yen almost 12 percent stronger against the dollar than the current rate of 117.26.
What makes Japan's success all that more surprising, according to foreign exchange traders and analysts, is that speculators and others in the currency market usually make it impossible for governments to manage a free-floating currency over an extended period unless it is backed with changes in economic policy.
Britain was defeated by speculators in such an effort in 1992, when George Soros, the legendary hedge fund operator, was said to have made $1 billion from trades involving the pound. The currency crisis of 1997 was aggravated by speculators betting that countries like Thailand would not be able to continue to manage their currencies' value.
In addition, a recent surge in the Japanese stock market, where the Nikkei 225 index is up 36 percent since the end of April, is attracting foreign investors, whose purchases of yen should strengthen the currency.
But Japan has been successful by being aggressive, intervening in the market on 34 days through the end of June, the latest daily data available, and spending almost 9 trillion yen to buy approximately $75 billion, effectively stalling the rise of the yen and the fall of the dollar. (Another 179 billion yen was used to buy euros.)
This persistent intervention, which through July is only 1.4 trillion yen short of the 10.4 trillion yen worth of interventions over the previous three years, has basically scared off the hedge funds and other speculators who would be betting now on a rise in the yen and a fall in the dollar, just as they have bet this year on a rise in the euro.
"It has caught people off guard and people are just staying away," said one top foreign exchange executive about speculating on the yen. Officials in the Ministry of Finance in Japan, he added, "have sent deliberate messages to us to tell our hedge fund clients and proprietary trading desks not to speculate on the yen."
Japan's success is also based on the acquiescence of the Bush administration, which has not complained publicly about the negative effect of a weaker-than-should-be yen on American car and other manufacturers. If the yen strengthened, it would make Japanese exports more expensive here and, therefore, less competitive.
Rick Wagoner, the chairman of General Motors, has not been reticent, however. In a May speech, he referred to the difficulty of competing with Japanese companies "due to active intervention to keep the Japanese yen weak, versus the U.S. dollar."
As part of an effort to assuage governors and manufacturers who say that Chinese imports are undermining American business and costing jobs, the administration is pressing China to let its currency, the yuan, rise in value against the dollar. Because it is now pegged to the dollar it moves with the dollar and keeps its competitive advantage. A stronger yuan would cut into that advantage.
In last week's announcement of Treasury Secretary John W. Snow's visit to Japan and China next week, the Treasury Department said that "exchange rate issues" would be discussed during the visit to Bejing. But there was no mention of exchange rate issues in the description of the agenda for the meeting in Tokyo.
When asked about the statement yesterday, Tony Fratto, a Treasury spokesman, said, "Currency issues will be discussed in Japan, as well."
In an interview Monday, John Taylor, under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, told Reuters that "there's no reason why recovery in Japan, in the sense of a sustainable rate of growth in the 2 to 3 percent area, should have any particular effect on the yen."
Referring to this comment, David Puth, global head of foreign exchange at J. P. Morgan, said, "It is apparent that the United States is reasonably comfortable with Japan's actions and is appropriately sensitive to the fragility of the Japanese recovery."
Mr. Gilmore of Foreign Exchange Analytics also said there was "some complicity here from the Bush administration" because the huge reserves of dollars the Japanese have built up during the intervention have been used to buy billions in Treasury securities; that has helped to slow the recent surge in interest rates here as the economic outlook improved. Other analysts said that Japan's support of the war in Iraq was also a reason for the lack of a response from the Bush administration.
But while Treasury officials have not complained directly so far, Mr. Snow has said that exchange rates should be set by the market. Analysts said this turn of phrase meant that the administration would accept a weaker dollar over all, and that it would like the Japanese to allow the yen to find its own value.
Another reason for the success, said Larry Kantor, the global head of market strategy at Barclays Capital, is that it is easier for a central bank to weaken its currency -- or keep it from getting much stronger -- than to push a falling currency higher.
In Japan's case, the Bank of Japan can use an essentially unlimited supply of yen to buy dollars, limiting the yen's climb. But to make the yen stronger, Japan would have to use its dollar reserves to buy yen. Although Japan's foreign currency reserves are formidable, they have a limit and that makes a strengthening much harder to accomplish.

HEADLINE: Need Milk? Expect a Bigger Bite 

BYLINE:  By DAISY HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
For Rafael Martinez, it is bad enough that the price of milk will go up 47 cents per gallon on Monday. But worse, the increase will arrive the same week he has to buy notebooks, sneakers and pencils for his two children going back to school in Washington Heights.
 "Right now, my expenses are triple," Mr. Martinez said from behind the counter of Mas Grocery, the bodega he manages on the corner of 115th Street and Second Avenue. 
 In New York City, Long Island and the lower Hudson Valley, the price for a gallon of milk will increase on Monday to $3.16 from $2.69. In the rest of New York, the price will jump to $2.94 a gallon from $2.47.
"It is one of the highest month-to-month increases" in the past two years, said Jessica Chittenden, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Agriculture and Markets, which monitors retail milk prices to prevent price-gouging. 
The price of milk is determined by how much the federal government decides farmers should be paid for producing it, based on supply and demand, Ms. Chittenden said. Milk has remained relatively cheap for the past 18 months at $2.69 a gallon, a price reminiscent of the 60's and 70's.
Prices initially went that low because of a cold, wet spring in 2000, said Larry Salathe, a senior economist at the United States Department of Agriculture. Dairy cows produced less milk. Farmers began earning more for their milk and started to overproduce.
Then came 9/11, and a drop in demand because fewer people were eating out, said Peter Fredericks, a chief economist based in Albany with the United States Department of Agriculture. Farmers, left with lower prices for their milk, began producing less, resulting in the latest price increases.
"It won't prevent me from buying," Beulah Brown said yesterday as she pushed her cart, with two gallons of milk, down the aisles at the Pathmark at 125th Street and Lexington Avenue. At 89, she takes care of three grandchildren, including Isa, 8, who politely reminded her that she had forgotten to get ice cream.
In another aisle, Gwen Taylor was shopping for herself and her son, Lawrence, 7. In her cart were two half-gallons, one headed for the freezer at home to keep it from spoiling. 
"This is an hour's worth of work," said Ms. Taylor, a telemarketer who earns $7.50 an hour and works part time. "You got to work an hour for this milk." She shook her head. "We can't drink it all at once."

HEADLINE: Scientist Files Suit Over Anthrax Inquiry 

BYLINE:  By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
Dr. Steven J. Hatfill, whom senior government officials have identified as a "person of interest" in their investigation into the 2001 anthrax mailings, filed a lawsuit yesterday accusing Attorney General John Ashcroft and other Justice Department officials of having violated his constitutional rights and the agency's own rules by making him a "fall guy" in their inquiry.
 In the 40-page civil suit filed in Federal District Court in Washington, Dr. Hatfill asserted that Mr. Ashcroft and other Justice Department employees had ruined his life and violated his rights to free speech and privacy by making public information about him to cover their failure to make progress in the investigation of the anthrax attacks in the fall of 2001. The letters containing minute quantities of the deadly germ killed 5 people, infected 17 others and put thousands on antibiotics. 
 By publicly identifying Dr. Hatfill as a "person of interest" in the case and through other information given to the press and innuendos, the lawsuit says, Mr. Ashcroft and the other officials destroyed Dr. Hatfill's professional reputation, making him "not only unemployed, but as a practical matter unemployable."
The complaint said Justice Department officials had never previously used the term "person of interest."
Dr. Hatfill is seeking unspecified monetary damages from Mr. Ashcroft, the Justice Department, the F.B.I. and other current and former officials at those agencies.
A spokesman for the Justice Department said the agency would not comment on the suit or its charges. But he noted that H. Marshall Jarrett, the Justice Department counsel, found in January that Mr. Ashcroft had not engaged in professional misconduct or violated Justice Department rules by publicly describing Dr. Hatfill as a "person of interest."
Dr. Hatfill's suit won praise from L. Lin Wood, a lawyer for Richard Jewell, whom federal authorities and the news media identified, falsely it turned out, as the suspect in the 1996 Olympics bombing in Atlanta.
"I applaud the effort because I think we have to make sure there are checks and balances against the government," Mr. Wood said.
Dr. Hatfill is not the first scientist to file such a suit. In a lawsuit filed in late 1999, Dr. Wen Ho Lee accused the F.B.I. and the Justice and Energy Departments of engaging in a campaign of news leaks that violated his privacy and wrongfully portrayed him as a spy. The case is pending.
Dr. Hatfill's lawsuit details the alleged surveillance and harassment that he has endured and the substantial financial price he has paid since the government's inquiry began focusing on him last summer. It says that Dr. Hatfill, a medical doctor and an expert on biological weapons defense, cooperated with the government's inquiry for months.
The suit says he was dismissed from a teaching job at Louisiana State University after a campaign by officials "without producing any evidence against him, without officially naming him as a suspect," his lawyer, Thomas G. Connolly, said.
The suit says the F.B.I.'s constant physical and electronic surveillance of Dr. Hatfill and his home constitute undue harassment that "continue to prevent Dr. Hatfill from finding gainful employment, or enjoying any semblance of a normal life." It states that last May an F.B.I. agent tailing him struck Dr. Hatfill near his apartment in Georgetown. He was not seriously injured.
Government officials have said that Dr. Hatfill has come under suspicion partly because he worked for a time at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Md. The lab is one of several government facilities that has stored the strain of anthrax that was found in the deadly anthrax letters.
But the complaint says that while the government has devoted "tens of thousands of man hours and tens of millions of dollars trying to pin the anthrax attacks" on Dr. Hatfill, it has found "no evidence" linking him to the crime.

HEADLINE: U.S. Corn Subsidies Said to Damage Mexico 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
The more than $10 billion that American taxpayers give corn farmers every year in agricultural subsidies has helped destroy the livelihoods of millions of small Mexican farmers, according to a report to be released on Wednesday.
 Prepared in advance of critical trade talks next month, the report by Oxfam International argues that the subsidies given American corn farmers allow them to sell their grain at prices far below what it costs to produce. That has led to cheap American corn flooding the Mexican market and pushing the poorest Mexican farmers out of business, the report said. 
 "There is a direct link between government agricultural policies in the U.S. and rural misery in Mexico," according to the report entitled, "Dumping Without Borders: How U.S. agricultural policies are destroying the livelihoods of Mexican corn farmers." 
Like many other nongovernmental groups, Oxfam is working to promote changes in international rules at the meeting of the World Trade Organization in Cancun, Mexico, next month.
Mary Kay Thatcher of the American Farm Bureau Federation said that while it was obvious that American corn farmers received subsidies unavailable to Mexican farmers, that did not mean Americans had an unfair advantage. "In Mexico versus the U.S. it's a no-brainer," she said. "The Mexicans have far lower labor costs, lower land costs, input costs. To say that our subsidies are hurting Mexican farmers is ridiculous. It's not true."
Administration officials also rejected the idea that American exports to Mexico undermined farmers there. Julie Quick, a spokeswoman at the Agriculture Department, said that since most of the American corn exported to Mexico was used as animal feed for Mexico's rapidly expanding chicken and pork industries, it could not be undercutting small Mexican farmers who grow corn for human consumption.
"If we were dumping corn, then Mexico could file a complaint under the World Trade Organization, and Mexico has not," Ms. Quick said.
Trade and development experts atthe World Bank say that reducing or eliminating the agricultural subsidies and tariffs of wealthy nations would help developing nations more than any other single action.
The World Trade Organization has put changes in farm practices and trading rules at the top of its agenda during the current round of talks, which are dedicated to the developing world.
Mexico, the birthplace of corn, opened its borders to American corn exports after signing the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994. Within a year, corn imports from the United States doubled and today nearly one-third of the corn used in Mexico is imported from the United States. The United States is the biggest exporter of corn in the world and the biggest exporter of corn to Mexico.
The report said the price of Mexican corn has fallen more than 70 percent since Nafta took effect, severely reducing the incomes of the 15 million Mexicans who depend on corn for their livelihood.
But Bush administration officials said the Mexican government gave some price support to its corn farmers. The support is minimal, however, since the entire Mexican agricultural budget is only one-tenth the size of the subsidies given to American corn farmers alone, according to the Oxfam report.
Trade officials said today that agricultural trade had increased in both directions under Nafta, noting that Mexico's total agricultural exports to the United States had doubled under the agreement.
"The U.S. has been at the forefront working for ambitious and substantive global agricultural reform; we look forward to Mexicans joining us," said Richard Mills, the spokesman for the office of the United States trade representative.
A new statistical analysis of global subsidies released today argues otherwise, and says the wealthier nations have been undermining agriculture in the poor and developing world.
According to a study by the International Food Policy Research Institute, a nonprofit research organization, the agricultural policies of wealthy nations -- including tariffs, export subsidies and direct farm subsidies of over $300 billion every year -- cost developing nations about $24 billion every year in lost income.
Latin America and the Caribbean lose $8.3 billion each year, the largest sum of any region, according to the institute's report.
While both reports acknowledge that Mexico and other developing nations fail to provide enough support to their rural communities, their focus was to encourage wealthy nations to cut their subsidies. The institute's report concluded, "The fates of hundreds of millions of small-scale farmers and poor consumers in developing countries struggling to survive on a dollar or two of income a day hang in the balance."

HEADLINE: Study Finds Rise in Benefits For the Unemployed of 9/11 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
In one way at least, the thousands of New York City workers left jobless after 9/11 were luckier than those unemployed earlier or later -- because they were far more likely to collect benefits from New York State's unemployment insurance program. 
 That is the unexpected finding of a report to be released this week by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. It is based on questionnaires filled out by more than 2,500 New Yorkers in the five boroughs who were unemployed in 2001 or 2002. 
 Only 52 percent of those who became unemployed before 9/11 collected unemployment insurance benefits, the study found, but that percentage jumped to almost 65 percent in the months after the disaster. In 2002, however, the percentage fell to 56.5. 
The increases after 9/11 were particularly striking among those workers who are normally least likely to collect unemployment insurance: immigrants, low-wage workers and members of minority groups, according to the study.
The temporary increase came as something of a surprise to researchers, said Annette Bernhardt, senior policy analyst for the Brennan Center and an author of the report. It attributes the rise in benefits to the outpouring of assistance by government, charity, union and community groups, which informed jobless workers about their eligibility for benefits and helped them with the automated telephone application process.
"The lesson is that workers need help in accessing the unemployment insurance system," Dr. Bernhardt said. "They need a center that they can go to for information, staff that can help them figure out their eligibility, and translators to help them navigate what really is a complex application system." 
A spokesman for the New York State Department of Labor, Robert M. Lillpopp, said he had not seen the Brennan Center study and so could not comment on it. The department did not relax its rules on unemployment insurance eligibility after 9/11, he said.
But, he added, the department itself did extensive advertising to inform unemployed workers about benefits and other help. "We printed hundreds of thousands of palm cards in multiple languages -- English, Spanish, Chinese and Korean," he said, which were distributed at aid centers and job fairs.
And the state has since created a "language line" that connects people applying for benefits to someone who speaks their native tongue, Mr. Lillpopp said. The department now also allows people to apply over the Internet.
Critics of the state program frequently complain that workers who do not speak English or Spanish have difficulty navigating the system for getting and keeping benefits, a problem in a city where people speak everything from Albanian to Urdu. And a federal judge recently ruled that the state continues to reject applications improperly, despite some improvements.
Mark Humowiecki, a staff attorney at MFY Legal Services, said he was representing a worker whose native language is Bengali and whose English is limited. His client applied, ultimately successfully, for benefits, but then failed to navigate the automated system that those who receive benefits must use to check in every week. 
"I'm amazed at the number of hoops he has to go through just to get less than $200 a week in benefits," Mr. Humowiecki said, adding that his client has filed an appeal with the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Albany. 
New York State's unemployment insurance program provides up to six months of benefits for jobless people who qualify; the maximum payment is $405 a week, though the statewide average is less than $275, according to the federal Department of Labor. 
And even though most workers pay unemployment insurance taxes, only 44 percent of those statewide who lost their jobs collected benefits last year, according to federal data. 
The Brennan Center percentages were higher in part because of the way the questionnaires were distributed, Dr. Bernhardt said. Some participants filled them out with the assistance of community groups that had helped them to apply for benefits.

HEADLINE: Car Sales Slow Despite Spending on Incentives 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
In another sign of how competitive the car market has become, auto companies spent a record amount on incentives in July, yet their vehicles sat unsold on dealers' lots for a record length of time.
 Moreover, Ford Motor and the Chrysler Corporation lost market share in July, though the average incentives for Detroit's auto companies grew to the highest level ever, according to Edmunds.com, a company in Santa Monica, Calif., that offers consumers buying advice and tracks industry trends. 
 In figures scheduled to be released on Wednesday, Edmunds estimates that car companies spent an average $2,668 on rebates, interest-free loans, lease deals and other discounts last month, up $519 or nearly 25 percent from July a year ago. Edmunds bases its calculations on industry sales data and transactions at dealerships. 
At the same time, Edmunds said the average time a vehicle spent in the showroom before being sold rose to 78 days in July. Put another way, that meant a vehicle that arrived on a dealer's lot on July 1 would not be sold until mid-September.
That compared with 54 days at the beginning of 2003, and 60 days in July 2002.
Normally, vehicles leave dealerships faster in the summer, when buyer traffic is strongest and auto companies are eager to clear their lots of leftover vehicles before the start of the new model year on Oct. 1. 
Increased incentives have generally translated to higher sales for the auto companies. But Jesse Toprak, a senior analyst at Edmunds, said the sluggish economy was upsetting longstanding industry patterns. Sales fell 4.5 percent in July, despite the historic incentives.
"The market doesn't act the way it's supposed to," Mr. Toprak said in an interview today.
According to Edmunds, the Big Three auto companies spent a record $3,631 a vehicle on incentives in July, compared with $1,873 for European auto companies, $1,447 for Korean automakers and $1,075 for Japanese auto companies.
Among individual companies, General Motors, which has been in the spotlight for its relentless approach to incentives in the last two years, spent a record $3,969 a vehicle in July, up 7 percent from June. But, G.M.'s efforts paid off, as it picked up 1.2 percentage points of market share, to 29.1 percent. A strong point for G.M. has been Cadillac, which has sold luxury cars like its CTS sedan with minimal incentives.
By contrast, Ford's spending on incentives rose 3.8 percent from June to $3,377 in July. But its market share last month dropped to 18.1 percent, "one of its lowest levels in the last several years," according to Edmunds.
Chrysler, whose chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, has likened rebates to heroin, was the only Detroit auto company to spend less on incentives in July. Its average was $3,192, down 9.2 percent from June. Chrysler's market share also fell, by 1.7 percentage points from June, to 11.8 percent, its lowest level since August 2001, Edmunds said.
Chrysler's decline put it perilously close to Toyota Motor, the fourth-best selling company in the United States. It gained seven-tenths of a point of market share in July, despite spending less on incentives, to reach 11.2 percent of the market, Edmunds said. Toyota's incentives were $962 per vehicle versus $1,008 in June, down 4.5 percent. Some Toyotas, like the new Sienna minivan, are commanding sticker price and above.
Honda Motor also gained one percentage point of market share in July, rising to 8.5 percent, while its average incentive rose 11 percent, to $467, from $420 in June, Edmunds said. Two models, the Pilot sport utility vehicle and the Element, a boxy crossover vehicle aimed at young customers, accounted for much of Honda's increase.
Mr. Toprak noted that the gains at Toyota and Honda came despite erosion in one of their traditional market strengths: midsize cars. Last month, sales of midsize cars like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord accounted for only 15.7 percent of the market, down from nearly 20 percent as recently as January 2001. By contrast, large pickup trucks took 14.5 percent of the car market in July, up from 12.5 percent at the beginning of last year.

HEADLINE: High School Seniors Get Highest SAT Math Scores in 35 Years 

BYLINE:  By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
The scores of high school seniors on the SAT math exam have climbed to their highest level in 35 years. Experts tied the gain to the growing number of students learning algebra in the eighth grade and taking more advanced courses in math after reaching high school.
 The average math score was 519, out of a possible 800. 
 Educators around the country hailed the results of the 2003 SAT tests, released here today, as good news, with some reservations: the scores of students from rural areas and large cities continued to lag, and women continued to lag behind men, particularly in math. 
The results appeared to overturn the traditional equation that shows test scores falling as more and more students take the exams. This year, a record number of students, 1.4 million, took the SAT, but scores rose three points each in both the math and verbal sections of the exam.
"A lot of work has been done to improve math, and it's beginning to pay off," said Gaston Caperton, president of the College Board, which sponsors the test.
But Mr. Caperton, a former governor of West Virginia, said that after looking at the results, he worried that "not enough money" was going to impoverished schools under the new federal education act, No Child Left Behind.
"A democracy really depends on equal opportunity for an education, and these figures show that we're not providing that equal opportunity," Mr. Caperton said. "In large cities and rural areas, you see they're really still behind. They're really not catching up, and that's what concerns us. That's what No Child Left Behind was really focused toward."
Today's results appeared to contrast sharply with the results of the ACT, another college entrance exam, released last week. Those results showed student scores holding steady, but at a level indicating that a majority of students were unprepared for college-level work in math or science.
Three years ago, however, the ACT organization signed contracts to administer its exam to all high school students in Illinois and Colorado, expanding the pool of test-takers to include many students who had no intention of attending college, said Jon Erickson, vice president for educational services at ACT.
An increase of a few points on the SAT "or a stable score on the ACT are in some ways representing the same news," Mr. Erickson said. Students who took their high school's college preparation curriculum, which typically includes a foreign language and higher levels of math and science, also increased their scores on the ACT, he said.
In addition, said Cyndie Schmeiser, the vice president for development at ACT, the two exams measure different kinds of learning. The ACT tests knowledge of the curriculum for a given subject, while the SAT more generally measures aptitude and the ability to reason. Unlike the SAT, the ACT results showed no gap between the performance of men and women.
The average math SAT score of 519 represented a 16-point gain over the last decade, while the average verbal score of 507 represented a 7-point gain.
Henry Levin, a professor of economics and education at Teachers College, Columbia University, attributed the "reasonably good improvement" to the increased competition among high school students for admission to selective colleges and universities. That has led more students to tackle hard courses, including Advanced Placement courses, he said.
"School districts have vastly increased the numbers of students in these courses and the numbers of courses available," Professor Levin said. "Kids who in the past would not have taken A.P. courses are now being encouraged to take them."
Educators were also watching today's results for the performance of states like North Carolina and Texas, which have been in the forefront of the standardized testing movement. Texas, in particular, has served as a model for No Child Left Behind, which requires annual testing of students in math and reading from third through eighth grade. Until last year, its state exam, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, showed steady gains in performance among high school students.
But the SAT scores of Texas seniors improved only slightly over the last decade, by two points in math and three points in verbal skills. At 500 in math and 493 in verbal skills, the Texas scores fell below national averages. In the same period, the numbers of students taking the SAT in Texas grew only slightly faster than the national average.
But the number of black and Latino students taking the SAT grew by about 50 percent in the past decade, said Debbie Graves Ratcliffe, a spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency. "We think it's a good sign because we're really encouraging more kids to think about college as an option."
But with scores in Texas seemingly stagnating on both the SAT this week and on the ACT last week, state officials were concerned. "I think it's a sign that we need to look at the math curriculum and how students are doing in their courses," Ms. Ratcliffe said.
"A lot of our reforms have been aimed at the elementary level," she added. "We've yet to see that translated into big performance gains at the high school level." She added that the State Legislature recently appropriated $100 million to improve high school instruction. "Hopefully, that will pay off."

HEADLINE: Critics Say Housing Proposal Would Worsen a Shortage 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
Advocates for moderately priced housing are reacting angrily to a state proposal that would substantially ease requirements for such housing in the suburbs. 
 The proposal, unveiled Monday by the Council on Affordable Housing, the state board that sets housing policy, was praised by municipal leaders, who have long complained that the state's housing regulations encourage suburban sprawl. But critics say the plan would increase racial and economic segregation and worsen New Jersey's severe shortage of modestly priced homes. 
 "Today is a sad day," said Kevin D. Walsh, a staff lawyer with the Fair Share Housing Center, a nonprofit agency in Cherry Hill. "This proposal will result in the continued ghettoization of Camden, Trenton and Newark," three cities that have significant proportions of low-income minority residents. 
Since 1975, when the State Supreme Court handed down a ruling that came to be known as the Mount Laurel decision for the township whose zoning had been challenged, New Jersey municipalities have been legally bound to provide a "fair share" of low- and moderately priced homes, a quota based on factors including projected population growth and the amount of undeveloped land. Regulations based on the ruling were intended to circumvent exclusionary zoning laws and encourage integration in the suburbs, but they were so complicated that builders began using them to force communities to accept unwanted development.
Under the plan unveiled Monday, the number of new low-income housing units required would be tied to growth: communities would be required to provide one low-income home for every 10 market-priced homes they approve and every 30 jobs that are created. Communities that do not want any new development would no longer be forced to add low-income housing.
Susan Bass Levin, the state community affairs commissioner, whose department oversees housing policy, said the new proposal would give municipal officials more power to regulate growth and make it harder for builders to use the Mount Laurel ruling to develop land set aside for preservation as open space.
"The current system didn't work," said Ms. Levin, who is also the chairwoman of the Council on Affordable Housing. "It is overcomplicated, overly bureaucratic, and didn't produce the results it should have. The new approach balances the need for affordable housing with the need for towns and communities to plan their growth sensibly." 
Diane Sterner, executive director of the Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey, a nonprofit group, said she supported an overhaul of the state's housing laws because only 37,000 moderately priced units had been built in 17 years -- more per capita than most other states, but far too few to ease the state's housing shortage. But she said the new proposal offered townships so many loopholes thatthey could completely avoid building low-income housing.
"They've diluted the Mount Laurel mandates to a point where nothing is going to happen," she said. "The methodology and the numbers are horrendous." 
After a public comment period, the 11-member board of the Council on Affordable Housing will vote on whether to adopt the new proposal. 
William G. Dressel Jr., executive director of the New Jersey League of Municipalities, said the new rules were far simpler and would allow township and borough leaders to avoid the lawsuits that have allowed developers to pave over open space. 
"I have faith that when people adjust to these new regulations, it will work out better for everyone," he said.
But Mr. Walsh, the lawyer for Fair Share Housing, said he and other advocates were prepared to challenge the new rules in court unless they were substantially modified. "We aren't going to sit down while Mount Laurel is trampled on," he said.

U.S. Crop Policy Is Said To Hurt Mexican Farmers
The more than $10 billion that American taxpayers give corn farmers every year in agricultural subsidies has helped destroy the livelihoods of millions of small Mexican farmers, according to a report by Oxfam International.
 The report says that the subsidies given to American corn farmers allow them to sell their grain at prices far below what it costs to produce. That has led to cheap American corn flooding the Mexican market and pushing the poorest Mexican farmers out of business, according to the report. Page C4.

HEADLINE: Home Sales Remain Strong; Confidence Index Climbs 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
Americans bought newly built homes and expensive manufactured goods at a brisk pace in July, and a report on consumer confidence this month was surprisingly strong, indicating that an economic recovery is on course.
 The government said today that sales of new homes fell slightly in July. But the total was still ahead of expectations because the record high sales pace of June was revised upward. 
 While down 2.9 percent from June, sales of new homes in July were still at the second-highest level on record.
The Commerce Department said that orders for durable goods rose 1 percent in July, and the Conference Board said that its index of consumer confidence rose to 81.3 in August from an upwardly revised 77 in July. But the confidence survey also suggested that job seekers were still having a hard time finding work.
"The general conclusion that I would draw is that the recovery is gaining momentum but a large proportion of the population are still waiting for some more proof," said Mark Vitner, an economist at Wachovia Securities.
Stocks sagged, with analysts saying that the good news had already been priced into the market. Treasury securities initially fell in price after the data but then rallied as equities sank. 
Demand for cars led the increases in durable goods orders, but there were increases across the board. Orders of motor vehicles and parts surged 5.5 percent and machinery orders climbed 1.8 percent, while demand for computers and electronics rose 1.9 percent.
Excluding transportation, orders rose 1.7 percent, and without spending on the military, orders were up 1.4 percent.
"Over all, it's a healthy report," said Mike Niemira, senior economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. "I think it continues the very upbeat picture that has been painted now for a couple of months, that manufacturing is finally coming out of its slump."
The home-sales report showed that even as the housing boom began to slow as mortgage interest rates rose from 40-year lows, home buying remained attractive.
Sales of new single-family homes slipped to a seasonally adjusted 1.165 million annual rate -- the second-highest pace on record.
"The housing market remains strong," said Mickey Levy, chief economist at Banc of America Securities. "One piece of data that jumps out is that inventories of unsold homes are very, very low, suggesting that even through the end of the year, you're going to see continued construction strength."
Inventories equaled June's record low of a 3.5-month supply of homes available at the current sales pace.
In another good sign for the economy, consumers said they felt more optimistic in August about the future. The Conference Board's confidence index showed that the expectations component climbed to 94.4 from 86.3 over the last month.
But pointing to the current conditions index, which declined to 61.6 from 63.0, analysts offered a word of caution about the report.
"The consumer number isn't really as good as it looks," said Drew Matus, economist at Lehman Brothers. "The labor market is still holding back people's confidence, and in the long run will probably hold back people's willingness to spend additional money."

Giant Mallof America Plans to Be Even Bigger

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: BLOOMINGTON, Minn. 

 BODY:
The decor is a little dated, but 11 years after its opening, the Mall of America is still the nation's biggest shopping and entertainment center, with 2.5 million square feet of retail space surrounding a bustling amusement park and at least 40 million visitors a year.
 But to the developers of the mall, it is not big enough. In June, Ikea began building a 330,000-square-foot store on 15 acres that it bought from the Simon Property Group, the mall's managing partner. Expected to open June, the new Ikea store will be across the street from Nordstrom, one of the shopping center's four anchors. 
 Simon and the other investors in the mall hope that the arrival of the popular home-furnishings giant -- whose closest store at present is in the Chicago suburb of Schaumburg, Ill., about 400 miles away from this Minneapolis-St. Paul suburb -- will jump-start a second phase of construction that will expand the Mall of America, which is already home to more than 500 stores and theme restaurants. 
The development of the 43-acre site, just north of the mall, has been stalled by the faltering economy and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which raised fears that the shopping center might be a likely target. 
The mall has also been at the center of a federal lawsuit in which the Triple Five Group, one of the developers, has accused Simon, the world's largest retail real estate investment trust, of secretly negotiating in 1998 with a third partner, TIAA-CREF, the financial services company, to gain control of the shopping center.
Triple Five, a company with headquarters in Las Vegas and Edmonton, Alberta, that is run by the Ghermezian family, the developers of the even larger 5.3-million-square-foot West Edmonton Mall, is seeking to replace Simon as managing partner of the mall. Testimony in the nonjury trial ended on Aug. 11, and a ruling is expected within a few weeks.
Despite these distractions, Maureen Bausch, the vice president for business development, said the mall was actively seeking tenants for the vacant expansion site. Tentative plans call for the addition of three hotels, a spa and an office building, as well as entertainment attractions, perhaps including a performing arts center. Additional retail space might be devoted to categories that are not widely available at the mall like electronics and home furnishings, Ms. Bausch said. The size of the project has not been determined, a Simon spokesman, Les Morris, said. 
Ikea characterizes its project as a free-standing store rather than an anchor for the mall's second phase. "We are using the term 'neighbor,' " an Ikea spokesman, Joseph E. Roth, said. "But that said, we will be a major catalyst for further enhancing the retail destination that is the Mall of America." Ikea, which has 18 stores in this country, announced plans in January to add 50 stores in North America in 10 years. The store here will not be connected to the original Mall of America, but a skywalk will link it to the hub of the new shopping area, Mr. Roth said.
Now that more than a decade has passed, the mall is undergoing some modifications, with about 65 tenants either moving to new locations or modernizing their stores, Ms. Bausch said. The common areas are also being spruced up, and the bathrooms are being updated, a mall spokeswoman, Monica Davis, said.
Stores that appeal to certain types of customers are being grouped together. Therese Byrne, a New York retail real estate consultant who has advised the mall, said it needed to appeal to a broader range of shoppers. "They need to appeal to the sophisticated customer," she said.
Just how successful is the Mall of America? Traffic at the mall has returned to pre-Sept. 11 levels, with visitors from outside a 150-mile radius of the mall holding steady at about 35 percent, Ms. Bausch said. But while about 25 percent of the tourists used to come by air, these days as few as 18 percent do, according to a survey conducted by the mall last summer.
In documents filed earlier this year with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Simon reported that the mall was 97 percent occupied. Ms. Bausch estimated that about 20 of the tenants (apart from the 70 kiosks) are temporary, many of them fledgling concepts brought in under the mall's retail incubator program.
In testimony at the trial, the two sides offered wildly different assessments of the mall, which was built on the site of the Minnesota Vikings' former stadium. It was the Ghermezians who came up with the idea of building a lavishly scaled mall combining entertainment and shopping, and who landed the right to develop the project in 1985. They later brought in Simon (then known as Melvin Simon & Associates) as a development partner and manager. 
TIAA-CREF provided the entire $650 million in equity financing and acquired a 55 percent stake in the shopping center, with the other partners getting 22.5 percent each. In 1999, TIAA-CREF sold half its stake to Simon for $318 million, including $160 million in cash and the assumption of $134 million in debt. TIAA-CREF also received $24 million in preferred stock.
In the suit, a lawyer for the Ghermezians, Roger J. Magnuson, has argued that Simon, which also has other ventures with TIAA-CREF, made the deal behind his clients' back and stands to gain hundreds of millions of dollars in profits. 
But Simon maintains that the Ghermezians were fully aware of the deal, had no money to invest in the project and simply wanted to get Simon to pay heavy damages. "This lawsuit," a Simon lawyer, Lawrence J. Field, said in his closing argument, "was an attempt to squeeze the Simons, to force the defendants to make Triple Five happy by giving them something for nothing."
During the trial, Simon has sought to minimize the value of the mall, saying it brings in about $40 million a year in earnings and estimating its worth at $540 million.
By contrast, an appraiser hired by the Ghermezians testified that the mall, together with the amusement park, is worth about $745 million, a figure that would climb to about $984 million once the second phase is completed.
Simon does not report sales figures for individual malls, but its chief executive, David Simon, testified that the Mall of America does less well than some other Simon properties, like the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, because it does not draw luxury retailers and has lost out to other malls when competing for tenants like the Cheesecake Factory and Crate and Barrel. Mr. Simon told the court that the mall management recovers 70 percent of its costs for taxes, insurance, common area maintenance and marketing, less than at other malls.
By contrast, an expert witness for the Ghermezians testified that sales for stores of 10,000 square feet or less run about $530 a square foot, much more than the $330 average.
Retail real estate specialists say the Mall of America poses a challenge to store owners, who pay heavy additional charges for common areas, insurance, security and property taxes.
"Getting your share of the market is difficult," said Steven B. Greenberg, the president of the Greenberg Group, which advises specialty retailers. "You have to consummate a sale early. There tends to be sense of, 'I've got so much to see, I've got to move on.' "

HEADLINE: When Airlines Share, Consumers Win 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 If government approval of alliances between airlines will aid the balance sheets of some American air carriers and keep thousands of airline workers employed, maybe that is a good thing. 
 Robert Crandall ("Thank You for Flying Whatever Airline This Is," Op-Ed, Aug. 23) expresses concern about the decreasing presence of United States carriers on transAtlantic flights and the loss of thousands of American jobs. 
The United States' presence over the Atlantic could have increased dramatically if American Airlines had taken advantage of all the international routes it acquired from the purchase of T.W.A.
Instead, American abandoned many of those routes and put a majority of T.W.A. employees, including me, on the unemployment lines.

HEADLINE: Japan's Bulls Chilled by Cool Snap 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
Just as the bulls were starting to return to Tokyo, Japan's economy appears to have hit a bump on the road to recovery. The culprit this time is not the banks or a major corporate collapse, but the coldest summer in a decade.
 In theory, a few extra weeks of rain and chill should not derail a $4.4 trillion economy. But in Japan, where most full-time workers receive their bonuses in June and July and take vacations in August, the summer months are akin to the Christmas shopping season in the United States. 
 For companies in a range of industries, from beverages to electronics to travel, the months from June to August are crucial. Yet temperatures in Tokyo have been almost three degrees Celsius below average and the capital has received just two-thirds as much sunshine this summer, hurting sales of everything from bathing suits to beer.
 The cold snap and longer-than-usual rainy season, which typically ends in early July in Tokyo, could shave as much as half a percentage point off Japan's growth rate in the July-September quarter, according to some estimates, a significant amount considering that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.3 percent from April to June.
 "We're already seeing an impact from the summer blues on retail spending, and the dreary holidays in August may have killed leisure spending as well," said Ryo Hino, an economist at J.P. Morgan Securities in Tokyo.
 While not enough to bring on a recession, the slower sales could dent the largest and most vulnerable part of the economy -- consumer spending. They may also force Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to consider more pump-priming measures. This could strain the budget and force Mr. Koizumi to reverse his pledge to restrain the budget deficit just ahead of general elections expected this autumn. One of Mr. Koizumi's leading critics, Shizuka Kamei, a senior member of Mr. Koizumi's party, said today that he wanted the government to spend an additional 10 trillion yen ($83 billion) this year.
 Companies, however, are not waiting for government handouts; they are cutting sales and profit targets. Supermarket chains, like Ito-Yokado, Seiyu and Aeon, and Japan's two largest beer brewers, Asahi and Kirin, recently cut their earnings forecasts sharply.
 Over all, supermarket sales declined 5 percent in July compared with a year earlier, while spending at convenience stores fell a record 7.3 percent. Sales at 7-Eleven Japan, the country's largest chain of convenience shops, tumbled 4.9 percent even though managers reintroduced oden and nikuman, two foods suited to colder weather, according to a company spokesman, Tetsuhiro Kaneko. (Oden are various foods simmered in a fish broth, and nikuman is a meat-filled dumpling.)
 Prices for fresh vegetables and fruit have also risen, and this year's rice crop is expected to be worse than usual, which could force the government to release some of its emergency stockpiles. Ito-Yokado said sales of peaches, watermelons and other high-price summer fruit had plunged as prices spiked.
 And economists expect consumer price figures, to be released Friday, to confirm this trend.
 Electronics companies like Matsushita Electric Industrial and Toshiba say sales of air-conditioners fell almost 30 percent in July, in line with the industry as a whole.
 The colder, wetter weather has also put a damper on Japan's 10.8 trillion yen ($90 billion) travel industry. Most major railways have had fewer travelers this summer. The airlines likewise had fewer passengers on international routes -- partly because of the lingering effects of SARS -- though the airlines reported small gains in domestic traffic.
 Casualty insurers have also suffered, with a surge in claims from victims of water damage.
 Taken together, the decline in sales and the resulting effect on corporate profits could reduce the gross domestic product by about 1 trillion yen ($8.3 billion) in the second half of this year, according to the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
 Every cloud, though, has a silver lining. Earlier this year, the Tokyo Electric Power Company was forced to shut its nuclear power plants for safety inspections, leading analysts to predict that Tokyo would face brownouts if the summer was hotter than usual. The unseasonably cool weather, though, led to a record decline in power consumption in July, giving the utility some breathing room to restart its power plants.
 Summer bonuses also rose a healthy 3.14 percent this year, with payments to workers at manufacturers growing at their fastest rate since 1990.
 What workers do with that money is crucial. If they put it into savings accounts, it may be spent later. But apart from the weather, economists say other factors are eroding spending. An increase in social security insurance premiums in April is taking a bigger bite out of bonuses this year, they said, while higher food prices and recent increases in tobacco and liquor taxes have also undermined purchasing power.

HEADLINE: Starting From Scratch 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
As I was riding back from the U.N. office in Baghdad a few days ago, I came to an intersection where an Iraqi civilian in a brown robe was directing traffic. I don't know whether he was a good samaritan or simply out of his mind, but he had a big smile on his face and was waving cars here and there with the flourish of a symphony conductor. Some cars obeyed his directives, and others didn't (there are still virtually no working stoplights in Baghdad), but he was definitely better than nothing -- and he was definitely having a good time.
 This man came to mind as I thought about the debate over whether we have enough troops in Iraq. The truth is, we don't even have enough people to direct traffic. This troops issue, though, is more complicated than it seems -- because it's not just about numbers. No, what we need in Iraq today is something more complex: we need the right mentality, the right Iraqi government and the right troops. Let me explain. 
 Let's start with mentality. We are not "rebuilding" Iraq. We are "building" a new Iraq -- from scratch. Not only has Saddam Hussein's army, party and bureaucracy collapsed, but so, too, has the internal balance between Iraqi Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds, which was held together by Saddam's iron fist. Also, the reporting on Iraq under Saddam rarely conveyed how poor and rundown Saddam had made it. Iraq today is the Arab Liberia. In short, Iraq is not a vase that we broke to remove the rancid water inside, and now we just need to glue it back together. We have to build a whole new vase. We have to dig the clay, mix it, shape it, harden it and paint it. (This is going to cost so much more than President Bush has told us.)
Which leads to the second point. Yes, we need more boots on the ground, but we also need the right mix: military police, experts in civilian affairs and officers who know how to innovate. Sure, there is still a guerrilla war to be won, but the main task today for U.S. soldiers in Iraq is political: helping towns get organized, opening schools and managing the simmering tensions between, and within, different ethnic groups. If Bulgarian or Polish troops can help do that, bring 'em on. If not, stay home.
Just ask Col. Ralph Baker, commander of the Second Brigade, who oversees two Baghdad districts. He and his officers have been conducting informal elections for local councils and getting neighborhoods to nominate their own trusted police.
"First we taught them how to run a meeting," he told me in his Baghdad office. "We had to teach them how to have an agenda. So instead of having this sort of group dialogue with no form, which they were used to, you now see them in council meetings raising their hands to speak. They get five minutes per member. It's basic P.T.A. stuff. We've taught them how to motion ideas and vote on them. . . . I have them prioritizing every school in their districts -- which they want fixed first. I have to build credibility by making sure that every time they establish a priority, it gets done. That helps them establish credibility with their constituents. . . . There is a big education process going on here that is democratically founded. The faster we get Iraqis taking responsibility, the faster we get out of here."
And that leads to the third point: we need to get the 25-person Iraqi Governing Council to do three things -- now. It must name a cabinet, so Iraqis are running every ministry; announce a 300,000-person jobs program, so people see some tangible benefits delivered by their own government; and offer to immediately rehire any Iraqi Army soldier who wants to serve in the new army, as long as he was not involved in Saddam's crimes. It was a huge -- huge -- mistake to disband the Iraqi Army and put all those unemployed soldiers on the streets, without enough U.S. troops to take their place.
Together, all of this would put much more of an Iraqi face on the government and security apparatus, and begin to reclaim the mantle of Iraqi nationalism for the new government, taking it away from Saddam loyalists -- who are trying to make a comeback under the phony banner of liberating Iraq from foreign occupation.
Again, I have to repeat the dictum of Harvard's president, Larry Summers: "In the history of the world, no one has ever washed a rented car." Most Iraqis still feel they are renting their own country -- first from Saddam and now from us. They have to be given ownership. If the Bush team is ready to put in the time, energy and money to make that happen -- great. But if not, it's going to have to make the necessary compromises to bring in the U.N. and the international community to help.

HEADLINE: Rabbi Accused of Stealing Grant Intended for Disabled Children 

BYLINE:  By BENJAMIN WEISER

 BODY:
An orthodox rabbi in Brooklyn was charged yesterday with stealing about $700,000 in federal grant money that was supposed to go toward building a school for disabled children.
 The rabbi, Milton Balkany, 57, was accused by federal prosecutors in Manhattan of diverting thousands of dollars of grant money to a personal bank account, as well as using grant money to pay for life insurance premiums, income taxes, electronics, cosmetics and restaurant bills. 
 He also paid money to companies in Israel and New York with which his family members had connections, prosecutors charged. 
"When Congress appropriated this grant," the United States attorney, James B. Comey, said in a statement, "it did so with the intent that the funds be used to build a school and help New York's disabled children. The complaint alleges the defendant ignored those requirements in order to line his own pockets and reward others who clearly were not entitled to the taxpayers' money." 
The rabbi, who was released on a $750,000 personal recognizance bond in Federal District Court in Manhattan, will vigorously fight the charges, his lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said later.
"He has violated no law," Mr. Brafman said. "He has no done nothing wrong." Mr. Brafman said he was confident the rabbi would "be able to demonstrate that not one penny was misappropriated, and that every dollar was indeed used for the benefit of learning-disabled children." Mr. Brafman called his client a scholar "with an impeccable reputation" who was involved in "many philanthropic and educational institutions."
Rabbi Balkany, who runs a Jewish day school in Brooklyn called Bais Yaakov, voluntarily surrendered to the authorities yesterday at 8 a.m., a federal prosecutor, Evan T. Barr, said in court.
The rabbi, who was charged with theft of government property, false claims, wire fraud and obstruction, sat quietly during the brief hearing, wearing a black skullcap.
Rabbi Balkany came into public light a few years ago after The Daily News reported that he had helped get day-care vouchers for parents by giving their names to officials in the Giuliani administration. No illegality was found, city officials have said.
The rabbi has also long been an aggressive political fund-raiser, often for Republican causes, according to news reports and records. He was once nicknamed the Brooklyn Bundler for his ability to round up contributions, one news report said. A 2000 report by The Associated Press said the rabbi and his family had given $23,000 to Rudolph W. Giuliani's mayoral and Senate campaigns. A spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani declined to comment yesterday.
The charges yesterday had nothing to do with any of those activities.
A criminal complaint filed by Mr. Comey's office said that in 1999 Rabbi Balkany received a $700,000 Congressional "Economic Development Initiative" grant, administered through the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The grant was issued to "the Children's Center of Brooklyn, New York," the complaint said, "for the construction of a facility to house educational and therapeutic programs for disabled preschool children." The money was to be used to refinance a mortgage for the Children's Center, the complaint said. 
In November 2001, investigators with the federal housing agency's inspector general began a review after finding that the funds were withdrawn from the account in a single lump sum instead of gradual disbursements, and that the center had not filed required progress reports.
In an interview with an auditor in December 2001, the rabbi refused to show books and records, "stating that he did not have to explain how he used the HUD money," the complaint said.
The grant money went to various uses, prosecutors said. One check for $300,000 was paid to a corporation in Israel, one of whose officers is the rabbi's son-in-law, the complaint said. Money was also paid to other rabbis or Jewish institutions, or used for personal items, the complaint charged.
Mr. Brafman said one difficulty his client faced in dealing with the government was "that the regulations for these programs are extraordinarily complicated, and there are times when mistakes can be made." 
"But a mistake that is made in good faith is a far cry from intentional criminal conduct," Mr. Brafman said, "and in this case there was no intentional criminal violations of the law."

HEADLINE: Tallying the Dead in Iraq 

 BODY:
The American intervention in Iraq has reached a disheartening milestone. With the death of an American soldier yesterday in an ambush outside Baghdad, more American military men and women have now died in the postwar period than perished during the war itself. That grim statistic mocks President Bush's triumphant appearance aboard the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln on May 1, when he declared an end to major combat operations. More important, it makes clear that the United States will pay a high price in blood and treasure if the Bush administration persists in its misguided effort to pacify and rebuild Iraq without extensive international support. 
 Giving a greater role to the United Nations and recruiting thousands of foreign soldiers to help patrol Iraq would not relieve the United States of its obligations or extinguish the dangers that American forces face. But these steps would make the postwar occupation more manageable and give the Iraqi people a sense that their country is not turning into an American outpost in the Arab world. It might also make Americans more willing to support the long-term commitment that will be needed to transform Iraq into a modern, democratic and prosperous state. 
 By invading Iraq without a clear-cut mandate from the United Nations Security Council, Washington all but guaranteed that an American military victory would be followed by a predominantly American occupation, with all the disadvantages that entails. The White House compounded the problem by leaving postwar planning and administration largely in the hands of the Defense Department, elbowing aside the State Department, the U.N. and private relief organizations. The Pentagon was woefully unprepared for the collapse of law and order, the breakdown of basic services and the difficulties of moving a society from tyranny to democracy.
To turn things around, Mr. Bush needs to enlist help from more experienced officials in Washington and at the U.N. That will not be easy for an administration that openly advertises its contempt for the U.N. The White House should accept a new Security Council resolution broadening U.N. political and economic authority, enabling other countries to make substantial contributions to an international peacekeeping force. The administration should also be honest about the investment -- American and international -- required to rebuild Iraq.
A stable peace in Iraq cannot be won on the cheap or absent foreign partners. With the death count mounting daily, it is time for Mr. Bush to stop pretending otherwise.

HEADLINE: Vivendi to Deal With 2 Prospective Suitors 

BYLINE:  By BILL CARTER and GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
The bidding for the entertainment assets of Vivendi Universal narrowed to two contenders yesterday when the company's board, after meeting in Paris, declared that it would continue talks with General Electric's NBC division and an investor group led by a previous owner, Edgar Bronfman Jr., whose family controlled the Universal entertainment empire.
 The winnowing, which was widely expected, means that Vivendi Universal is essentially left with a choice between the two competitors. NBC is offering a partnership in a combined NBC-Universal entertainment conglomerate, without giving Vivendi much in the way of cash. Mr. Bronfman's group, on the other hand, would buy a majority stake in Vivendi's entertainment assets, for which the company is said to be seeking about $14 billion. 
 Vivendi did leave itself one other possible option, saying it was investigating the possibility of aligning itself with some other company and making an initial public offering that would create a new, larger media entity. But many analysts said they regarded that as mainly a negotiating ploy.
While Vivendi executives have not indicated that they favor the NBC or the Bronfman approach, several media analysts said yesterday that NBC seemed to be in the better position because its offer would probably be seen as more attractive to Vivendi's executives and shareholders. 
"The NBC bid makes the most sense because it offers the greatest synergies and greatest long-term return for Vivendi Universal's stockholders," said David W. Healy, who specializes in mergers and acquisitions at the law firm of Fenwick & West in Mountain View, Calif.
Vivendi's American entertainment assets include film and television studios, the USA and Sci-Fi cable channels, and an interest in the Universal theme park business. Those assets, known as Vivendi Universal Entertainment, include the Universal Music business, though the music company is not for sale.
A merger involving NBC and Vivendi Universal Entertainment would create a company better able to compete with other large media concerns like Viacom, the News Corporation and Walt Disney because it would add a movie studio, television production studio, cable channels and theme parks to NBC's holdings. A special benefit of such a deal for NBC would be that it would gain control of hit television programs produced by Universal -- the three "Law and Order" series that are crucial to the network's continued leadership in prime time.
A sticking point remains NBC's disinclination to include cash in an offer. That could still tip the balance toward Mr. Bronfman if Vivendi decided it wanted to cash out immediately.
But Mr. Healy said NBC's ability to combine the distribution power of its broadcast stations and cable channels with Universal's media assets made such a merger a natural fit.
And Michael Nathanson, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said he doubted that a Bronfman offer could prevail. "There have been other bidders with greater opportunities to find cost-cutting or revenue-enhancing strategies," he said, "including Liberty Media, Viacom and MGM, and they bowed out because the economics did not work. I have a hard time imagining that the Bronfman group could offer near what Vivendi wants."
Still, Mr. Nathanson pointed out, just by staying in the competition, the Bronfman family might benefit because it owns 24.5 million shares of Vivendi Universal stock, or 2.29 percent of the company. If Vivendi ultimately strikes a deal with NBC that pleases Vivendi's investors, this could increase the value of the Bronfman stake, he said.
Representatives for Mr. Bronfman had no comment. An NBC executive also declined to comment on the Vivendi board's decision yesterday or the status of the competition.
The board's decision was the latest round in what has become a drawn-out auction for the Vivendi Universal assets. Beyond Liberty, Viacom and MGM, expressions of interest have come from the Comcast Corporation and from a group headed by the investor Marvin Davis.
In its formal statement leaving the door partly open to a third party, Vivendi did not name a potential partner. An executive close to Vivendi said it was still exploring possibilities with Comcast. But executives close to Comcast said it had not held serious discussions with Vivendi in recent days.
The protracted process is beginning to take something of a toll within Universal, some senior executives there said. In a telephone interview yesterday, Ron Meyer, the president of Universal Studios, said, "This has been an enormous challenge for this company, and it is in the best interests of Vivendi Universal Entertainment for the parent company to make a decision that does not prolong the process."
Mr. Meyer pointed out that over the years, the movie, television and cable businesses had performed extremely well. But in recent months, he said, "the auction has become a big distraction. People at the company need to start focusing on the future, and this is very much on everyone's mind." 
One clear strength in NBC's offer, several analysts said, is its parent company, General Electric, which is highly regarded in Europe. When G.E. bought NBC in 1986, its ability to manage a media company was questioned because of its reputation for promising shareholders steady growth. Media holdings were considered volatile because of the cyclical nature of ratings for television programs.
But NBC has flourished under its chairman, Robert C. Wright, who has led NBC since G.E. bought the network. For 2003, NBC is projecting a record operating profit of $1.9 billion, which would make it one of the two most successful units of G.E. for a second year. (The other is GE Power Systems, which makes gas-turbine engines.)
The old questions about G.E.'s patience are being raised again as it considers a joint venture with Vivendi Universal, given the unpredictability of the film business.
But Universal Pictures has done very well under Mr. Meyer. And in recent years, many studios have developed a strategy for film investment that aims to reduce risk by sharing production and sometimes distribution costs, either with other studios or independent producers. While that strategy limits how much a studio can make from a hit film, it also cushions the downside, which makes the business less volatile, a longtime media analyst, Harold Vogel, said.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 30, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day on Wednesday depicting the potential for a proposed joint venture between NBC and Vivendi Universal Entertainment, and the comparison between such a venture and its competitors, listed the media businesses of Walt Disney incompletely. In addition to a film library and operations in broadcast and cable television, television and film production, radio and publishing, Disney has a music recording and music publishing operation.

HEADLINE: Leap in Deficit Instead of Fall Is Seen for U.S. 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
Even if the economy rebounds strongly over the next few years, the federal budget deficit could climb for the rest of the decade if Congress adopts proposals strongly supported by President Bush, the Congressional Budget Office said today.
 Offering a sharp contrast to recent projections by the White House, which had said the budget deficit would hit $475 billion next year and decline significantly after that, the Congressional report warns that annual deficits could rise rather than fall. 
 The nonpartisan office said the deficit would be $480 billion next year but could reach a cumulative total of $5.8 trillion by 2013.
Administration officials quickly dismissed the Congressional projections as too speculative to take seriously, noting that long-term budget projections have been notoriously inaccurate. 
But the new analysis is nonetheless based on fairly cautious assumptions. It assumes that economic growth will surge next year and remain solid for the rest of the decade. The biggest reason for potentially much higher deficits is the added cost of legislation that both the White House and the Republican majority in Congress support.
That agenda includes making almost all the tax cuts of the past three years permanent, which Congressional analysts said would cost $1.5 trillion over 10 years. It also includes the cost of a major new prescription drug program for the elderly, supported by Republicans and Democrats, that would cost $400 billion over 10 years.
And it includes the cost of overhauling the Alternative Minimum Tax, which under current law is expected to force tens of millions of taxpayers to pay much higher taxes as their incomes rise with inflation. That change, supported by Republicans and Democrats alike, would cost an additional $400 billion over 10 years. 
Those adjustments alone would add about $500 billion to the deficit over the next 5 years and about $2.7 trillion over 10 years. If government spending continues to increase at anywhere near the rates of the past five years, the deficit would surge far higher.
That would be in sharp contrast to Mr. Bush's outlook. Last month, the White House Office of Management and Budget projected that the deficit would peak at $475 billion next year and decline to just $62 billion in 2008.
The Congressional "baseline" forecast, which is not allowed to consider the costs of any legislative proposals not yet enacted, shows a similar trend.
But when Congressional analysts spelled out in stark terms for the returning Congress the costs of additional tax cuts and new Medicare benefits, the deficit would remain at over $500 billion in 2008 and continue to climb after that.
Democrats immediately pounced on today's report to charge that Mr. Bush and his Republican Congressional allies were leading the country into a fiscal catastrophe just as today's baby-boom generation begins to approach retirement age and start drawing heavily on Social Security and Medicare entitlements.
"We have new numbers from the C.B.O., and what they show is that the president is taking us into the deep, dark hole of deficits and debt that will take the nation many generations to recover from," said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee.
Trent Duffy, spokesman for the White House budget office, countered that long-term budget projections were inherently unreliable and said today's report merely supported Mr. Bush's promise to reduce government spending.
"The only thing we know about 10-year projections is that they are terribly, terribly wrong," Mr. Duffy said today. "In 1993, 10 years ago today, C.B.O. did not predict that in the late 1990's we would have a surplus." 
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, director of the Congressional Budget Office, emphasized that his agency was not predicting huge new deficits so much as describing the likely consequences of different policy decisions.
"We don't mean these as projections," Mr. Holtz-Eakin told reporters today. "They are meant to illustrate the range of possible outcomes." 
Nevertheless, today's attempt to estimate the broader fiscal outlook was similar to projections by analysts from across the political spectrum. In June, economists at Goldman Sachs predicted that the federal government would run a 10-year deficit of $4.5 trillion. Congressional Democrats have come up with a similar number, based on similar assumptions.
"Among careful budget analysts there is not a great deal of controversy about what the forecast looks like, and it is grim," said Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal policy research group in Washington.
To be sure, forecasting budget deficits has been about as accurate in the past few years as forecasting earthquakes. Neither Congressional analysts nor the administration predicted the flood of tax revenue at the height of the stock market boom. Nor did they predict that revenues would fall for each of the past three years.
One big uncertainty over the next few years will be the costs of occupying Iraq and Afghanistan. The basic Congressional forecast assumes that this year's war costs will essentially continue and increase with inflation over the next 10 years.
Most analysts say that is unrealistic, because war-related costs will almost certainly decline. But the administration, for its part, has yet to budget anything for war-related costs in 2004 and thereafter -- a position that may be equally unrealistic.
The biggest uncertainty is about the trend in discretionary government spending -- programs from defense to education that lie outside mandatory entitlement benefits like Social Security and Medicare.
Discretionary spending has risen by about 7.7 percent a year for the past five years, far faster than the rate of inflation. Under Mr. Bush, the biggest new spending has been for defense, counterterrorism and a few domestic programs like education.
The Bush administration assumes that discretionary spending will climb by only 4 percent annually in the years ahead. The Congressional Budget Office tested out several different possibilities, and these produced huge differences in the budget outlook.
When the office assumed that discretionary spending would remain absolutely flat, not even keeping pace with inflation, the projected cumulative deficit over the next 10 years would shrink by $1.2 trillion.
That prospect would entail deep cuts in real spending, adjusted for inflation.
But if spending climbs in line with overall economic growth, Congressional analysts estimated that the projected deficits would swell by $1.4 trillion over 10 years. And if spending continued to climb as fast as it has in the past five years, the deficits would swell by $2.8 trillion over 10 years.
Despite the range of possible outcomes, today's report left little doubt that Congress and Mr. Bush face difficult choices.
Edward McKelvey, an economist at Goldman Sachs who has predicted steep new deficits for the next 10 years, said today's report had reinforced his views.
"Our pessimistic view of the budget outlook will remain very much intact," Mr. McKelvey wrote in a research note today after seeing the Congressional report.

HEADLINE: U.S. Set to Take a Hard Line In Talks on Korean Arms 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
North Korea will come under intense diplomatic pressure to scrap its nuclear weapons program on Wednesday as the United States, North Korea and its four neighbors begin unusual six-party negotiations on how to resolve the Korean arms crisis.
 The talks, scheduled to take place over three days here in the Chinese capital, are the most concerted diplomatic push on North Korea since President Bush took office. They pose a difficult challenge to the administration as it seeks to persuade the North to abandon its nuclear ambitions without directly rewarding it for doing so, which Mr. Bush said would be like succumbing to blackmail. 
 South Korea, Japan, Russia and China will take part in the negotiations, meeting the Bush administration's precondition that talks must involve the major regional powers.
Diplomats and experts say those four countries are likely to support American demands that North Korea dismantle its arms program and submit to inspections. But North Korean negotiators are known for seeking to exploit differences between the United States and the other countries involved, and the talks are expected to be difficult and prolonged.
The talks come at a sensitive time in Washington, with Bush administration officials sending starkly different signals about their willingness to reach a deal. On the eve of the talks, Jack Pritchard, the administration's special envoy for negotiations with North Korea who had advocated a conciliatory approach, resigned after being criticized by a prominent senator for being out of touch with administration policy.
A senior administration official said today that people who favor a hard-line negotiating stance had prevailed in the debate leading up to the talks. The administration, this official said, has firmly ruled out offering North Korea any concessions until it unilaterally abandons its nuclear program in a "complete, verifiable and irreversible" way.
The task of conducting negotiations without offering incentives will fall to James A. Kelly, an assistant secretary of state. He is expected to outline a multiphase process in which any American concessions would come only at the end, after North Korea admits the full scope of its nuclear activity, halts such activity and readmits inspectors. 
But other administration officials have indicated that they would not necessarily oppose South Korea or other regional countries offering economic incentives to North Korea. 
On the eve of the discussions, which were arranged after extensive shuttle diplomacy by Beijing's diplomats, Chinese officials called on all sides to come prepared to make concessions. That means ending North Korea's nuclear program but also offering the country a firm security guarantee, they said. 
"China holds that the Korean peninsula should be nuclear free and reasonable security concerns of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea should be addressed," Zeng Qinghong, China's vice president, said today, using the formal name for North Korea. 
The fact that talks are taking place at all, after a stormy session in April and North Korea's repeated claims that it is moving to reprocess plutonium for nuclear bombs, has prompted cautious optimism that they could be constructive, though almost certainly inconclusive. 
"There is real pressure on North Korea to make concessions, but also on the United States to be reasonable," says Susan Shirk, a former Clinton administration State Department official who is now at the University of California at San Diego. "I'd be surprised if we see a real breakthrough, but also if the talks collapse." 
Asian diplomats say the outlines of a potential deal are clear. North Korea would abandon its nuclear program and agree to intrusive inspections. The United States would provide a firm security guarantee and, along with its allies, offer aid, investment and other economic incentives to the cash-strapped country. 
Optimists, including Chinese, South Korean and Russian diplomats, say the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, has long viewed his nuclear program as a bargaining chip to be traded for the right mix of security assurances, diplomatic recognition and aid. 
But hard-liners in the Bush administration say they believe that Mr. Kim has no intention of giving up weapons of mass destruction. They argue that extended talks would just delay tougher measures to penalize the country or even topple the Communist government. 
"Negotiations really depend on North Korea being ready to trade away its deterrent, and I don't see any sign that they're ready to do that," said Victor D. Cha, an Asian studies specialist at Georgetown University. "As a result, I think you'll see positions remaining fairly entrenched on both sides." 
All the parties involved say North Korea will at a minimum drive a hard bargain and any resolution is likely to take months to reach. Neither the United States nor North Korea has indicated much new flexibility going into the talks, with each side emphasizing that the other must take the first steps. 
A significant difference with previous effort to find a diplomatic solution is the new and unusually assertive role of China. 
Beijing had previously maintained that the nuclear issue was a matter for North Korea and the United States to work out on their own. This time, Beijing put heavy pressure on North Korea, including briefly cutting off oil supplies, to bring it to the negotiating table. 
China's active role has pressed both sides to negotiate in good faith, experts say, because it has broad political and economic sway over the North. Beijing provides as much as 80 percent of the country's food and oil at concessionary prices. 
"China has put so much effort into these negotiations that if it becomes clear one side or the other lacks sincerity, China's support for that side is going to decline," said Chu Shulong, a foreign policy expert at Qinghua University in Beijing. 
China's cooperation is viewed as essential to the United States in the event the talks do not go well. The United States has made clear it may intercept North Korean sea shipments to prevent arms proliferation and to push for penalties in the United Nations, both of which could prove difficult without at least tacit Chinese support.

HEADLINE: Euro Vote Is Unlikely Soon As Britain Fo cuses on Iraq 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
With Britain's government embroiled in public scrutiny of its reasons for going to war against Iraq, one unexpected casualty of the conflict could well be an early vote on joining the euro single currency.
 The likelihood of a referendum on the euro has been hostage much of this year to the Iraq conflict, not because of any direct link between the issues but because of the effect the war has had on the popularity of Prime Minister Tony Blair, and thus his ability to persuade a skeptical nation to abandon sterling. 
 In June, Mr. Blair, helped by a relatively quick campaign in Iraq, seemed to have gone some way toward signaling that a referendum might still be possible before the next election, which must be held by 2006 but is likely to be called earlier. 
 "Earlier in the summer they were holding to the line that we could have a referendum in this Parliament" before a new election, said Ian Taylor, a pro-euro legislator from the opposition Conservatives. "Then they ran into Hutton," he said, referring to a senior judge, Lord Hutton, who is leading a public inquiry into the death, apparently by suicide, of the weapons expert David Kelly, whose body was found last month.
 The Hutton inquiry has become a critical test of the credibility of government claims that a threat from Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction justified going to war with the United States in Iraq. And the crisis has brought public trust in Mr. Blair -- likely to be a crucial factor in persuading British citizens to join the 12-nation eurozone -- to its lowest since he took office in 1997.
 "The government is now on the back foot and has got to rebuild the trust and respect of the British people," Mr. Taylor said. Up until a few weeks ago, he and other pro-euro campaigners "still hoped that it would be possible to have a referendum next year."
 "What's happened since is that events have knocked the government sideways," he said, "and I don't think that the government will have the respect and credibility to put the question to the British people in a way that's sufficiently convincing.
 Most analysts say that Mr. Blair and Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer who is known to be skeptical about the euro, would need months of dedicated campaigning to persuade British citizens to vote for a single currency. The two men also might be reluctant to wage a pro-euro campaign coinciding with the run-up to a national election. They appeared at an unusual joint news conference in June to promise a more vigorous pro-euro campaign, but the debate over the justification for war has overshadowed that effort.
 Also in June, Mr. Brown said that the euro failed most of the five economic tests he had devised to assess its suitability for adoption in Britain, making it more difficult to persuade British citizens in the next few months that the currency has suddenly shed its perceived disadvantages. But he indicated that the tests could be re-examined early next year. On average, some two-thirds of those responding in opinion surveys oppose joining the single currency.
 The troubles surrounding the pro-euro lobby have been highlighted by reports in recent days that the principal group set up to support the euro is in disarray. The group, Britain in Europe, was started with the support of Mr. Blair and other pro-euro politicians, but it says it is financed mostly by businesses and individual contributors.
 Britain in Europe's campaign director, Simon Buckby, acknowledged that the organization "needs to restructure and prepare to fight a much longer campaign than we were expecting," possibly after the next general election. The remark was seen as further evidence that the prospects for a referendum before then are dwindling fast.
 Britain's anti-euro campaigners could draw further encouragement next month when Sweden holds a referendum on whether to adopt the currency to replace the krona. Results of an opinion survey released today showed 53 percent of respondents opposed to the euro and 43 percent in favor.
 If the Sept. 14 referendum reflects that trend, then euro opponents in the other two holdouts -- Denmark and Britain -- will be encouraged. The 15-nation European Union is set to add 10 new member states next year.

HEADLINE: In a Long Presidential Race, Dean Sprints 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

 BODY:
Crisscrossing the country this week with Howard Dean, the underdog turned top dog who has surged toward the front of the Democratic presidential primary field, you would almost think there was an election coming up.
 Five months before the first ballot is cast and 15 months before the last will be counted, Dr. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, spent the past four days being ferried from rally to rally in a chartered jet as though in the heat of a head-to-head national campaign rather than in the nascent chapter of a long-shot bid in a crowded field. He hit states like Oregon that have little to do with nominations but could be crucial in a general election and all but ignored his Democratic rivals as he roused rabid audiences against their Republican nemesis, George W. Bush. 
 The staggering, seemingly spontaneous crowds turning up to meet him -- about 10,000 in Seattle on Sunday and a similar number in Bryant Park in Manhattan last night -- are unheard of in the days of the race when most candidates concentrate on the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire and would seem formidable even in October 2004. 
Yesterday morning, the campaign took another audacious step, saying that it would broadcast television advertisements in six new states beginning on Friday, and that it expected to raise $10.3 million in the three months ending Sept. 30 -- more than any other Democrat in a similar period save for President Bill Clinton in 1995.
"We have to be in the president's face to win," Dr. Dean, 54, said aboard the ancient Boeing 737 his staff dubbed the Grassroots Express.
"When this president talks, sometimes the opposite of what he says is really the truth," he said yesterday in Chicago, between speaking to a tepid union convention and being embraced by about 1,500 supporters atop Navy Pier, "and if we don't call him on it, we can't win."
Billed as the Sleepless Summer Tour, Dr. Dean's 6,147-mile, 10-city rampage cost $200,000 and had its own rock-concert-style T-shirt listing places and dates. (The concept: Americans are sleepless over unemployment and the lack of jobs and health care, while President Bush sleeps soundly at his Texas ranch. The reality: Plane-riders are sleepless from crammed schedules that stretch from 5 a.m. to midnight.)
It was the flashiest and most expensive of a spate of gimmicky Democratic campaign swings this summer, from Grillin' with the Grahams (as in Bob, the Florida senator) to Get on the Bus With Dennis (as in Kucinich, the Ohio congressman) to the Real Solutions Express, featuring Senator John Edwards of North Carolina.
The large and energetic crowds that followed Dr. Dean, and the meticulousness of his schedule and stage-managed events, prove he remains a phenomenon.
But the presidential-style trip could increase the risk of Dr. Dean peaking too early -- and revealed other potential pitfalls. Holding oceans of blue Dean placards at every stop were nearly all white hands, a homogeneity the campaign tried to counter with a rainbow of supporters on stage, which only drew more attention to the lack of diversity in the audience. The feisty crowds were filled with Birkenstock liberals whose loudest ovations always followed Dr. Dean's antiwar riff -- there were few union members, African-Americans, or immigrants.
It remains unclear how such untraditional rallies will translate into the nuts-and-bolts of nominations like endorsements, voter registration, fund-raising and debates. The campaign also may have trouble keeping people interested and preventing its events in coming weeks from seeming mundane.
"We have momentum," Dr. Dean said. "Keeping it is going to be a struggle."
Though polls taken this early in the race can be unreliable predictors, there are statistical signs to back up Dr. Dean's surge in popularity on the street. Zogby International, an independent firm, is scheduled to release Wednesday a poll showing Dr. Dean leading in New Hampshire with 38 percent of the vote to 17 percent for Senator John Kerry; in early July Senator Kerry had 25 percent to Dr. Dean's 22 percent. The poll has a margin of sampling error of 4.5 percentage points. 
As the tour began its final day, Joe Trippi, the campaign manager, announced plans not only to match President Clinton's record $10.3 million quarter, but also to buy two weeks worth of advertisements, likely to cost $1 million, in Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Wisconsin and Washington. He and the candidate both refused to say whether the campaign would abide by spending limits to obtain federal matching funds, something they originally promised to do but later reconsidered.
"Running for president of the United States is a marathon," Mr. Trippi told reporters en route from San Antonio to Chicago. "We decided we were going to run the first four miles at a 100-yard-dash pace. We decided we're going to run the second four miles at a 100-yard-dash pace."
The new advertising plan came after the campaign spent four days soliciting its Internet supporters to match the $1 million President Bush collected last week in the Pacific Northwest, a goal it reached during the Bryant Park rally. (There were also $100- to $1,000-a-plate parties at most stops during the Sleepless tour.) 
Linda Ornelas, 54, said she came to Portland State University on Sunday uncommitted but left planning to sign on to her computer and "give him some money."
"It's not that what he says is really so different from what anybody else says," said Ms. Ornelas, an administrator at a large athletic club. "It's that it doesn't feel like it's rhetoric."
After months of low-key question-and-answer sessions in small-town living rooms, Dr. Dean adapted to the masses by sprinkling call-and-response lines and defiant finger-pointing into his standard spiel. 
"For the first time I realized the fate of the country might be in my hands," he said later. "Not just because I might become president of the United States of America. Because there were a very, very large number of people depending on me to change the course of this country."
In Spokane, Wash., organizers had cut a basketball court in half with a burlap curtain, expecting 250 people. Instead, several hundred had to watch an enormous television behind the curtain, and 100 more were left on folding chairs in the patio, surrounding a faceless microphone.
"He's not running a campaign, he's running a movement," wrote Natasha C., one of four people the Dean campaign invited to chronicle the trip on their Web logs. "These are protest-size crowds, these are not politics-size crowds, and that's the critical difference."
But it is unclear what the movement is for.
Dr. Dean's standard presentation is a smorgasbord of universal health insurance, opposition to the Iraq war, balanced budgets, tax-cut repeal, affirmative action, gay rights, early-childhood intervention and a broad appeal for "community." The defining theme is all about getting rid of the incumbent.
"What brought me here is Dean -- and George," said Karin Overbeck, an independent at her first political rally, in Spokane. "For the second time in my life, I'm ashamed of my nationality. I was born in Germany and I was ashamed; now I'm ashamed to be American."
Though Dr. Dean often says that his message is appealing to independent thinkers across the political spectrum, when he polled the crowd in Portland there were loud claps for the Green Party and Democrats, but sparse smatterings when he asked about supporters of Perot and McCain. And while the people introducing him included Hispanic teachers and black preachers, the people buying the "Doctor is in" buttons were mostly aging flower children and the tongue-studded next generation.
"We're working really hard to change that," Dr. Dean said. At the union convention yesterday in Chicago -- where the undecided audience offered mainly polite claps for the zingers that had delighted the devoted -- he tried one of his newer lines: "When white people and brown people and black people vote together, that's when we make social progress in this country."
Between stops, Dr. Dean had his first lengthy talks with a large press corps aboard the Grassroots Express. He rarely veered off-message, even when turbulence forced him into a seat between reporters from Rolling Stone and Modern Physician magazines, who traded questions on guitarists and prescription drugs. 
Regardless of the record crowds, it isstill August -- of 2003. 
For each of the 800 people who skipped the Green Bay Packers game on Saturday night to chant "We want Dean" in a Milwaukee airplane hangar, there must be many like the young woman in the pink taffeta strapless bridesmaid's dress who went to the hotel bar where reporters and supporters were mingling over martinis and wondered, "What's going on here?"
Told it was the Dean campaign, she looked blank. Howard Dean, someone said. Running for president.
"President?" she asked. "President of what?"

CORRECTION-DATE: August 30, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Wednesday about Howard Dean's cross-country campaign trip misattributed a quotation about the campaign's resemblance to a "movement" with "protest-size crowds" and not "politics-size crowds." It was from Garance Franke-Ruta, a reporter for the American Prospect, not Natasha C., who interviewed Ms. Franke-Ruta and posted the comments on her Web log, which is chronicling the campaign.

HEADLINE: Cut-Rate Swedish Retailer Enters the Italian Market 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SYLVERS 

DATELINE: MILAN, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
To say Italians are fashion obsessed is like saying Americans love big cars or Brazilians love soccer. So can a Swedish clothing company renowned for making low-cost versions of top designers' fashions find success in the home of Prada, Versace, Armani and Valentino?
 The Stockholm-based Hennes & Mauritz, which has 900 stores in 17 countries, is about to find out as it prepares to open its first Italian shop on Sept. 19. To test the Italian market, the company picked Milan's busiest pedestrian shopping street, just a few blocks from the heart of the celebrated fashion district. 
 Hennes & Mauritz has transformed itself from its founding 55 years ago as a provincial Swedish clothing maker into a colossus that opens about 100 stores a year and had sales in 2002 of 53 billion Swedish kronor, or $6.2 billion, and profit of 5.69 billion kronor. One conspicuous hole in its foreign expansion has been Italy, home to the world's sixth-biggest economy as well as many of the top fashion companies and the clothing giant Benetton.
 "Italy is one of the biggest retail markets, so it is important that they are finally arriving," said Mats Hyttinge, an analyst with Hagstromer & Qviberg in Stockholm. "They always wait until they have the perfect location for the first store in a new country. They usually get the right spot. We'll see if they got it in Milan."
 Hennes & Mauritz, with almost 40,000 employees, has become a Swedish success story to rival Volvo and Ikea. Founded by Erling Persson in 1947 as Hennes, which is "hers" in Swedish, the company acquired Mauritz Widforss, a men's clothing store, in 1965 and added Mauritz to its name soon after. The publicly traded company is still controlled by the Persson family.
 Growing pains are inevitable. Hennes & Mauritz has become particularly susceptible to economic changes in Germany. Almost a third of sales are generated there, three times the volume in Sweden, the second-biggest market. With Germany sliding into recession, Hennes & Mauritz has had to deal with stagnating demand in Europe's biggest economy.
 Now the company is entering the Italian market just as the country confronts its first recession in 11 years and with analysts expecting the economy to expand a paltry 0.4 percent this year.
 "Unless the Italian recession intensifies and lasts for a long time, H&M should be able to weather the storm since their entry into the market will be very gradual," said Andrea Paladini, an analyst at Centrosim in Milan. "The current tough economic conditions could also have the positive effect of forcing the company to concentrate on finding out what really works for the Italian market. If they entered during an economic boom there would be the temptation to sit back and hope to benefit from a situation of general increased consumption. The problem with that is that when there is a downturn they wouldn't be ready to confront it." 
 H&M's chief executive, Rolf Eriksen, declined to be interviewed for this article.
 Despite the downturn and the occasional sputter, the expansion continues. In the first half of the year, Hennes & Mauritz opened 53 stores, including 11 in the United States -- there are now five in New York, including one on Fifth Avenue -- and the first ones in Portugal, the Czech Republic and Poland.
 "The biggest worry on their expansion is the U.S., because it is such a competitive market and because a venture that big requires considerable investment," Mr. Hyttinge said. "After a slow start in the U.S., it looks like they are getting things straightened out. They have improved the time-to-market everywhere in the past two years, and that has been key to their success."
 On average it takes Hennes & Mauritz about three months to go from a designer's idea to a product on store shelves, the "time to market." That falls to about three weeks for what the company considers "high fashion" products, whose success is dependent on quick availability. Analysts say that only the Spanish retailer Zara is faster.
 Another element of Hennes & Mauritz's success is that it does not own any factories. Instead, the company orders the half a billion items a year that it sells from almost 1,000 suppliers.
 By replicating styles being used by the top fashion companies while keeping prices relatively low -- a bathing suit from a new line costs 15 euros, or $16.31 -- Hennes & Mauritz has been able to win over young clients seeking less costly items that are still considered fashionable.
 Hennes & Mauritz will be opening in Italy a mere 300 feet from the Milan flagship stores of Benetton and Zara, which is also known for making cheaper versions of high-end styles. In addition to selling its own brand, Hennes & Mauritz has other brand names and a line of cosmetics.
 "The product mix is very good, and Benetton is certainly worried about the arrival of Hennes & Mauritz in its home market," Ms. Paladini said.
 In addition to the quick time-to-market and the vigorous expansion, another trademark of Hennes & Mauritz is its rigorous containment of costs -- managers travel in economy class and the use of taxis is kept to a minimum -- that helps it offer items that undercut most rivals on price.
 With less than 5 percent of sales now coming from the United States and with other markets, like Italy, completely untapped, Hennes & Mauritz may still have room to grow. The rapid growth model will be put to the test in the coming months when the company sees if it can convince Italians that cheap can also be chic.

HEADLINE: Rebels in Nepal End Cease-Fire; Government Puts Army on Alert 

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
In a surprise move, Maoist rebels withdrew from peace talks in Nepal today and declared the end of their seven-month cease-fire, prompting the government to put soldiers and police officers on high alert. But the rebels signaled that they might resume talks if the government gave in to a principal demand.
 The Maoists' announcement fueled fears of the resumption of a six-year insurgency that has killed more than 7,000 people and paralyzed the country's tourist-dependent economy. 
 The United States has condemned the rebels' tactics and is providing $17 million in military equipment and military training to the Nepalese Army. Both sides have been accused of systematic torture, kidnapping and summary executions. The insurgency has exposed Nepal's vast inequalities and, to the surprise of many longtime Western residents, its potential for savagery.
The Maoists' leader, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, also known as Prachanda, or the Fierce One, said in a statement today that his group saw no point in continuing the talks with the government, which was appointed by King Gyanendra.
"Our party wants to make it clear that there is no justification for the cease-fire, the code of conduct and the process of talks for now," he wrote, according to the Press Trust of India. "The government has ended the possibility of a solution through cease-fire and talks." He added that the government appeared to be "ready for more bloodshed."
But Mr. Dahal added that the rebels were ready to resume talks "in the event that people's sovereign rights and basic interests are re-established," the Press Trust reported. A government spokesman said it was ready to continue talks and called the Maoist statement "most unfortunate."
The Maoists had issued an ultimatum to the king that he accept the formation of a new assembly that would draft a constitution and define the king's role in Nepal, which is a constitutional monarchy. Their deadline was today. A goal of their insurgency was to abolish the monarchy.
Observers in Nepal were divided over whether the Maoists were bluffing or serious about resuming hostilities. After peace talks broke down in November 2001, Maoists immediately mounted extensive attacks across the country and the number of killings soared. Half of the 7,000 people who have died in the conflict are believed to have been killed between the collapse of talks in November 2001 and the establishment of the latest cease-fire in January 2003.
"It's very ambiguous, the way it is written," said Kunda Dixit, editor of The Nepali Times, referring to the Maoists' statement. "Some people have analyzed that it's off. Some people have said it's a way to put more pressure."
Low-level clashes between government forces and the rebels have resumed in the last month.
On Tuesday, 6 policemen and 10 rebels were killed in clashes, the Press Trust reported. On Monday, rebels fired on the convoy of former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba in southwestern Nepal. He escaped unharmed. A Maoist spokesman said they had not known that Mr. Deuba was in the convoy.
Last week Maoists complained after soldiers killed 19 of their fighters on the day before the third round of talks was to have begun.
Mr. Dixit said the next several days would show what lay ahead for the battered country. "If you go by past language and rhetoric, it's off," he said, referring to the peace effort. "We won't know until the first attacks take place."

Share Prices End Narrowly Mixed in Quiet Trading Day

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks drifted to a narrowly mixed finish yesterday in a session so quiet that the Dow Jones industrial average floated in a 40-point range.
 With no major economic or earnings news released and many traders and investors wrapping up their summer vacations, analysts had expected the session to be light and choppy. Trading volume has been thin throughout August. 
 "Summer is coming to an end," said Brian Williamson, an equity trader at the Boston Company Asset Management. "That is a good thing going forward. Volume will come back up." 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.66 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 9,333.79, having gained 22.81 points Tuesday in a late-day advance.
The market's broader gauges finished higher. The Nasdaq composite index rose 11.48 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,782.13, as investors continued a recent trend of shifting more of their money into growth stocks like technology issues.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index eked out a gain of 0.06 point, to close at 996.79.
Analysts said there was room for the market to pull back and that Wall Street had been expected to retreat, given that stocks are in their sixth month of rallies.
"Technically, stocks are starting to be overbought," said A. C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates in Santa Barbara, Calif.
Still, the declines were small and limited to the Dow. The major indexes continued to hover around highs not seen in more than a year; analysts said the current readings were being regarded as support levels on Wall Street.
For now, it looks like investors have already factored in an economic rebound and earnings recovery into Wall Street's higher prices, analysts said.
Brokerage firms' ratings affected the performance of several individual stocks.
The medical supplies maker Boston Scientific dropped $2.13, to $63.25, after Morgan Stanley lowered its rating to equal-weight from overweight.
Adolph Coors climbed $2.25, to $54.41, after Bear Stearns upgraded it to outperform from peer perform.
Exxon Mobil rose 42 cents, to $37.25, after Banc of American Securities raised its rating to buy from neutral.
Among other gainers, Sears, Roebuck advanced 85 cents, to $43.65, after saying its August sales at stores open at least a year were running better than expected. Earlier, the retailer forecast flat sales at stores open at least one year.

Treasury Prices Drop
By Bloomberg News
Treasury prices fell in New York trading yesterday on speculation that a growing economy will cause inflation to accelerate at the same time the government is borrowing more to finance a record budget deficit. 
An investor who bought $10 million of 10-year notes in mid-June has lost $996,959 as yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, have risen about 1.5 percentage points from a 45-year low.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates the budget deficit will be $480 billion next year, excluding the cost of occupying Iraq. L. Paul Bremer III, the United States occupation coordinator in Iraq, told The Washington Post such costs may total "several tens of billions" of dollars in the next year. 
"The economic news clearly has been positive and the news about budget deficits means greater supply and higher yields going forward," said Sharon Stark, chief fixed-income strategist at the brokerage arm of Legg Mason in Baltimore, which oversees $192 billion in assets. The 10-year yield "could touch 5 percent by year-end," she said. 
The 10-year Treasury note fell 15/32, to a price of 97 24/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.53 percent from 4.47 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 19/32, to 100 30/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.31 percent from 5.27 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
A beautiful mind is not enough when it comes to evaluating teachers.

BYLINE:  By Hal R. Varian; Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California at Berkeley.

 BODY:
BEING beautiful pays off. Economists have found that men with above-average looks are paid about 5 percent more than those with average appearance, while those who are below average in looks have wages 9 percent below the mean.
 But is this because of discrimination or productivity? 
 Clearly, being attractive is part of the job description for some occupations -- think of supermodels or television anchors. On the other hand, one might think that beauty would not have much effect on the productivity of, say, newspaper reporters or professors. 
However, research by two economists, Daniel Hamermesh and Jeff Biddle, has found that beauty has a substantial payoff across a variety of occupations, even those where it doesn't seem to be inherently valuable.
Perhaps beauty contributes to productivity in subtle and indirect ways. Homely sales representatives might not be able to sell products as effectively as attractive ones, while good-looking reporters might have an easier time finding willing news sources.
On the other hand, it might be that bosses award beautiful people with pay raises independently of performance.
It's hard to disentangle these two hypotheses. If attractive people are able to work better with customers, colleagues and clients, thereby producing more value for employers, one might argue that it is appropriate to reward beauty.
But if there is little relationship between measures of job performance and beauty, then higher wages for attractive people would amount to discrimination based on irrelevant characteristics.
To decide between the productivity hypothesis and the discrimination hypothesis one needs data on job performance.
Recently Mr. Hamermesh, a labor economist at the University of Texas at Austin who has long studied beauty and labor markets, wrote a paper with an undergraduate economics major, Amy Parker, that investigates the effect of beauty on a particular measure of performance: teaching evaluations for college professors.
The economists collected teaching evaluations for 463 courses taught by 94 faculty members at the University of Texas at Austin, along with some characteristics of the instructors, like sex, race, whether they were on tenure track, and whether they were educated in an English-speaking country.
They asked six undergraduate students to rate the photographs of the professors on a 10-point scale and used the average measure as a beauty score. The student ratings on the beauty scale were highly correlated with one another, suggesting that they were measuring the same aspects of appearance.
According to the economists' statistical analysis, good-looking professors got significantly higher teaching scores. The average teaching evaluation was 4.2 on a 5-point scale. Those at the bottom end of the attractiveness scale received, on average, a teaching evaluation of about 3.5, while those on the top end received about 4.5.
Other variables that positively influenced teaching ratings were being a native English speaker, being a non-tenure-track faculty member, and being male. The first fact is hardly surprising, the second is explained by the fact that non-tenure-track faculty members are often selected primarily for their teaching ability, but the third is a bit surprising.
On closer investigation the economists found that good looks were significantly more important for men than women in producing high teaching evaluations. The same effect was found in earlier research relating wages to beauty: being good-looking, or at least not being bad-looking, is significantly more important for men than for women.
There are various ways these results might be biased. Suppose professors who are well organized and tidy put more care both into choosing their photos and in organizing their courses. Then better-looking photographs would be correlated with higher teaching ratings.
To check for this sort of problem, the authors separated out "formal" pictures (men with neckties, women with jacket and blouse) from informal ones. The results didn't change.
There are even more subtle effects that might be present. Maybe those who value beauty want to take art appreciation courses, and this love of beauty influences their subsequent ratings of their professors.
Luckily, several of the courses were taught by multiple instructors, so the authors could examine differences in ratings while controlling for the courses selected. Again, the results stayed essentially the same.
The bottom line is that better-looking professors get higher teaching scores, all else being equal. To the extent that teaching is an important component of job performance, and to the extent that teaching evaluations accurately measure performance, basing salary on measured teaching performance implies a significant wage premium for beauty, even for college professors.
The really tough question is whether being beautiful truly increases teaching performance -- that is, helps the students learn more -- or whether the students are just reacting to an irrelevant characteristic.
As Mr. Hamermesh and Ms. Parker put it, "What if students simply pay more attention to good-looking professors and learn more?"
This effect would be a true productivity effect. If a television anchor's looks allow him or her to attract more viewers, that makes that person more valuable to the network. If a professor's looks help students learn more, then we might expect that aspect of job performance should be rewarded.
Mr. Hamermesh and Ms. Parker lead off their paper with a quote from the supermodel Linda Evangelista: "It was God who made me so beautiful. If I weren't, then I would be a teacher."
But it appears that the same physical attributes that made Ms. Evangelista a successful model would also contribute to her success as a college professor. At least the students might stay awake in class.

Estimates of Stored Natural Gas Are Probably Too Low, U.S. Says

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Energy Department said yesterday that its weekly natural gas inventory reports had probably been underestimating the amount of fuel that utilities were stowing for winter. 
 The figures have been skewed because the 45 gas storage companies sampled for the weekly report have been more active in tapping and refilling storage than others that were not included in the survey, an Energy Department statistician, Roy Kass, said. Extrapolating those exaggerated rates to the rest of the industry has been producing incorrect estimates of gas in storage. 
 "One can reasonably expect that the buildup has been greater" than stated in the department's weekly reports on gas storage, Mr. Kass said.
The department has not decided how to change its mathematical models and has no timetable yet, Mr. Kass said.
The department's weekly reports are the primary gauges of demand used by utilities, traders and speculators to predict price movements in the $120 billion gas market in the United States.
In June, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the House Committee on Energy and Commerce that tightening gas supplies and rising prices were hurting the nation's industries.
The errors were discovered when the weekly estimates were compared with actual inventories reported to the Energy Department by all 115 United States gas storage companies at the end of each month, Mr. Kass said. Speculation that the numbers are erroneous may cause futures prices to fall when the weekly report is released today at 10:30 a.m. 
"You have to question the overall veracity of the system" the Energy Department is using, said Larry Benedetto, vice president for research at the Howard Weil unit of Legg Mason in New Orleans. "When you create this much confusion, the response is usually negative."
Gas futures, the benchmarks for wholesale prices, soared to a record $11.899 for a million British thermal units in late February. They are up 44 percent in the last year after a harsh winter reduced inventories and North American production of the fuel declined.

HEADLINE: California Law Provides More Financial Privacy 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

 BODY:
California enacted the nation's most comprehensive financial privacy protections yesterday, forcing banks and other financial institutions to obtain the permission of customers before sharing their personal data with outside companies and giving consumers more control over how information about them is shared in corporate families.
 Gov. Gray Davis signed the politically popular bill on the floor of the Pacific Stock Exchange in San Francisco, saying, "By signing this bill, we're putting consumers in control of their intimate financial DNA." Mr. Davis, a Democrat, had changed positions on the specifics of the bill for more than two years. 
 Privacy advocates consider the bill a major victory, not only because it sets a precedent for other states, but also because of how it could influence Congress on one of the key laws that governs the financial rights of consumers, the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
The financial industry argues that a section of the act, which expires at the end of this year, prevents states from restricting the sharing of information among companies under the same corporate umbrella. For example, Citibank and Salomon Smith Barney, which are both part of Citigroup, can now freely share information about customers. If the restriction is renewed, however, it would pre-empt parts of California's new privacy law, which takes effect in July 2004.
A number of industry groups, including the American Bankers Association, the American Council of Life Insurers and the Securities Industry Association, have urged Speaker J. Dennis Hastert to move quickly to reauthorize the act.
"We hope that California law is not used as a model for the privacy law on the national level," said Frank Keating, the chief executive of the American Council of Life Insurers.
Industry groups say information sharing helps customers and the economy by ensuring that credit remains readily available.
Companies are apprehensive about having too many different privacy standards. "For the sake of commerce, for the sake of the consumer, for the sake of low cost, there needs to be one privacy standard," Mr. Keating said.
The main federal law governing financial privacy is the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which requires financial institutions to limit how personal information is shared with outside companies.
Privacy groups and consumer advocates have criticized those limits as too weak and an endorsement of low privacy standards.
"The federal law is afig leaf," said Jackie Speier, a Democratic state senator from the San Francisco area who was the main sponsor of the California legislation.
Under the current federal law, financial institutions can sell consumers' financial information, including account balances, credit card charges and personal details from loan applications, to anyone, as long as the consumer is notified of the option to decline. But unless consumers call, send a letter or otherwise notify a company, their information can be shared automatically.
The new California law says consumers must actively give permission to have their financial information shared with outside companies. The California protections also allow consumers to choose not to have their data shared with the affiliates, subsidiaries or companies with which the financial institutions have marketing agreements. The federal law does not have such a provision.
A section of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act allows states to enact stronger financial privacy protections than those in the federal law. Alaska, Connecticut, Illinois, North Dakota and Vermont have also enacted financial privacy legislation.
The issue has resonated strongly with the public. In North Dakota, a referendum on privacy legislation received a 72 percent endorsement last year, even though banking interests overwhelmingly outspent the proponents of the measure. In California, a petition to make financial privacy a ballot initiative received almost 600,000 signatures this year, significantly more than the 375,000 signatures required.
The threat of a referendum, initiated by a coalition of privacy advocates and some business executives, softened industry opposition to Senator Speier's proposal, as companies were concerned that a referendum would result in even more restrictive protections. The legislation became law after being introduced in each of the past four years, and as a result the ballot initiative was dropped.
"I've been pregnant three times, and I would give birth to a baby anytime compared to getting a bill like this through," Ms. Speier said.

Spill Illustrates Gap in Sewage System
After the blackout of 1977 caused a sewage overflow, all treatment plants were provided with back-up generators except for the 13th Street Pump Station, a failure caused by a mixture of administrative lethargy and delays brought on by stiff community resistance. So when the lights went out again earlier this month, the sewage spilled out again, causing beaches to close and posing health and environmental hazards. A1

Even if they had been warned in the hour before the blackout, officials in New York probably would not have tried to spare the state a power failure by disconnecting from its neighbors, the chief manager of the state's power grid said. The official also said that there was no reason to believe that giant power relays malfunctioned that day. B1

HEADLINE: In Reversal, U.S. Nears Deal On Drugs for Poor Countries 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
The United States said today that it was close to accepting an agreement, which it had rejected last December, to help poor nations buy generic medicines through exemptions from trade rules.
 The reversal by Washington -- meant to improve the access of millions of people in those countries to expensive patented medicines for AIDS and other diseases -- could enhance the Bush administration's international standing and prevent the collapse of global trade talks to be held in Mexico next month. 
 After weeks of intensive negotiations, the United States won assurances that countries would not take advantage of the arrangement to increase exports of generic drugs to nations that are not poor and do not have a medical emergency, diplomats involved in the discussions said.
They said an agreement could come as soon as Thursday. 
These global public health decisions are being made by the World Trade Organization because it protects intellectual property rights, including the patents held by pharmaceutical companies.
For years, poor countries have used moral and political arguments, saying concerns about patent protection paled in comparison with the needs of millions of poor people for advanced medicines that could save their lives.
Peter Allgeier, the deputy United States trade representative, said today in a telephone conference call from Geneva that he hoped to reach an agreement before the formal meeting of the World Trade Organization began in Cancun, Mexico.
"It is possible," Mr. Allgeier said. "We are still working very intensively on that."
Mr. Allgeier refused to discuss details. "It is so sensitive," he added.
But Faizel Ismail, the permanent representative of South Africa to the World Trade Organization, who was part of the private negotiations, said the United States accepted the deal because of new assurances that it would not be abused by the countries in need of generic drugs to fight diseases like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
"We were willing to reach out to the American pharmaceutical industry and find a way of including them in the consensus without sacrificing the substance of the agreement," Mr. Ismail said in a telephone interview from Geneva.
Developing nations had pinned their hopes on such an agreement. The European Union and Switzerland, the other big producers of medicines, signed off on a deal last December to allow poor nations to buy generic medicines to fight these diseases.
But the United States, with the strong approval of the American pharmaceutical industry, blocked the deal by exercising the veto that every member nation possesses at the World Trade Organization.
That move upended the timetable for the current round of trade negotiations that is dedicated to helping developing nations, and put the United States in the embarrassing position of being the lone nation opposing a solution to make vital drugs affordable for the poorest people on earth.
Poor countries already have the right to manufacture copycat versions of brand-name medicines in the event of a health emergency by issuing what is called a compulsory license. But the poorest nations have no factories to produce such medicine. The pending trade agreement solves that problem by allowing these countries to import the generic drugs from developing nations like Brazil or India under the compulsory license.
Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry group for research-based American pharmaceutical companies, said there would be no comment until a final deal was reached. But officials who have met with American pharmaceutical executives said that the companies would not lobby against the agreement.
Ambassador Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, was credited today by several officials with persuading the American pharmaceutical industry, as well as the White House, that a compromise had to be reached before the trade talks start on Sept. 10.
In the last few days, the United States struck an accord with a crucial group of developing countries -- including Brazil and India, which are large producers of generic drugs, and South Africa and Kenya -- raising the odds for a full agreement by the 146 members of the trade organization.
In exchange for these new assurances sought by the pharmaceutical industry, the United States dropped its demand that the agreement cover only a few diseases and that it limit the number of countries eligible to import the generic drugs, several diplomats said.
Instead, the United States has successfully lobbied more than 20 developed nations to agree to voluntarily opt out of using this agreement to import generic medicines, several officials said.
"This is better than what the United States originally wanted and doesn't limit the scope of diseases," said Nelson Ndirangu, a member of the Kenya delegation to the World Trade Organization.
But several nongovernmental organizations said the compromise did not go far enough to ensure that generic versions of medicine could be produced and exported wherever they were needed.
"We are saying that promoting public health and pursuing commercial objectives are not contradictory, and that we need a highly competitive market to keep prices down," said Ellen 't Hoen, director of the campaign for access to essential medicines for Doctors Without Borders, in a telephone interview from Paris.
The compromise was offered today at a committee meeting in Geneva and was greeted, officials said, with nearly unanimous approval.
Several ambassadors said they would consult with their governments before the Thursday meetings. Representatives from the Philippines and Argentina offered objections that officials said they hoped could be answered by the time the issue was brought before the trade organization on Thursday.

HEADLINE: A Television Network With aPC at Its Heart 

BYLINE:  By J.D. BIERSDORFER 

 BODY:
NECESSITY may be the mother of invention, but it can also play parent to an inspired adaptation, as a college television department that was having trouble communicating with its own students found out. With some creative thinking and a piece of equipment originally intended for something very different, the college has found a way to deliver programming efficiently from its television department all over campus by way of the school's computer network.
 Columbia College in Chicago has an enrollment of around 10,000 students and is known for its programs in communications, visual and performing arts, and other media-related subject areas. As with many urban campuses, the school's classrooms, lecture halls and laboratories are scattered throughout a densely packed neighborhood. In Columbia's case, they are spread over several blocks in the South Loop area, from the Theater/Film Annex on South Wabash to the English, radio and journalism departments on East Congress Parkway, with several buildings between along Michigan Avenue. 
 Universities commonly have closed-circuit TV networks that broadcast announcements, information and student-produced programming around the campus, but Columbia College's sprawl made doing something like that difficult. Although the school got permission several years ago from the city to install underground fiber-optic cable linking three buildings that backed up to a common alley, running more fiber-optic lines under the streets of downtown Chicago would have been prohibitively expensive.
Other options for creating a network were limited. The available spectrum in Chicago is already crowded with television channels, leaving little room for a new broadcast station. The skyscrapers in the Loop blocked microwave links. And an early attempt to use the school's computer network to carry video data directly to all the various buildings yielded unacceptable video image quality and overloaded the network. 
As a result, until last year students in Columbia College's television department were able to share their work only by copying it onto videocassettes and distributing them individually to the school's various buildings, where they were played on machines connected to public monitors. "It was an old-fashioned SneakerNet, schlepping VHS tapes around," recalled Michael Niederman, the chairman of the television department at Columbia.
Things began to change in the spring of 2002 when several of the college's staff members, including Mr. Niederman and Dave Mason, the chief engineer in the television department, saw a demonstration of a new Sony Electronics product, the NSP-100 network storage player, at a National Association of Broadcasters trade show. The Sony device was designed to receive, store and play up to 18 hours of compressed video and graphics sent over a standard Internet-protocol network -- without dragging down the entire computer network in the process.
"Someone from the film department said: 'You have to go look at this. It seems like something you guys could use,"' Mr. Niederman said. "Dave and I went to look at it. And we said this is really something we could use." The school bought several Sony NSP-100 boxes, which can each hold 40 gigabytes of data; each unit has a list price of about $1,995. 
Although Sony designed the NSP-100 primarily for use in sales booths, video-driven advertising signs and corporate training situations, the Columbia College crew realized that the machines could be plugged into the Ethernet network that already connected campus buildings. "What they had in mind was more of a kiosk kind of thing, where a program was just running constantly -- just put some content on this little box and let it run somewhere forever," Mr. Mason said. "We're using it more for our transmission purposes. We're changing it all the time." 
Students creating programs for the television network do their production work with standard industry tools like Avid editing consoles and other professional equipment. Once the programs are ready, the shows and video clips can be copied into a standard Windows-based computer and arranged in the desired sequence with Sony software on a playlist, much like one would use for making a mix of MP3 songs.
The video content and playlists are then sent from the PC over the network to the NSP-100 machines and TV monitors placed around the campus. To economize on network bandwidth, the next day's programming is typically sent out from the television department to the network storage players late the night before. Although the machines cannot be used for live television, they do allow for a text "crawl" across the bottom portion of the screen, so real-time information can be transmitted from the television department's control room.
"The nice thing about this system is that you don't have to send everything on the playlist to every box," said Mr. Mason, explaining that video content relevant to a specific department could be sent just to the NSP-100 located in that department's building. The college has also developed two "channels" of programming, one for short announcements and informational displays and another for long-form programming.
"Any urban college or college with infrastructure difficulties, it's an incredible solution," Mr. Niederman said of the network storage players and Columbia's inventive way of adapting them. Connecting all the campus's scattered buildings with an easy-to-update video link has drawn an enthusiastic response from students and faculty members alike. Students are showing an increased interest in creating video material, and the television department faculty has added a new course in television programming for the fall semester.
Mr. Niederman said the television department is also working toward the larger goal of having a full-fledged TV station for the college, complete with advertising revenues. "I don't think we ever would have been so ambitious if this box hadn't landed in our lap," he said.

HEADLINE: Big Board Chief Will Get A $140 Million Package 

BYLINE:  By LANDON THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Bowing to criticism of the secretive way it compensates its chief executive, the board of the New York Stock Exchange disclosed yesterday that its top executive, Richard A. Grasso, would receive lump- sum payments totaling $140 million in accrued savings and incentives, in addition to a base salary of $1.4 million and a bonus of at least $1 million. 
 The disclosure of the compensation -- the first in the exchange's 200-year history -- has raised new questions about the size of Mr. Grasso's pay and the guaranteed rate of return that investor watchdogs say the exchange has applied to his deferred compensation. 
 Corporate governance experts said yesterday that the big payout was highly unusual for the head of a regulatory body. 
While these experts praised the exchange's decision to disclose the details of Mr. Grasso's compensation, they regarded the $140 million payment as overly generous, all the more so because it was all cash and being awarded before his retirement. Typically, large payouts to corporate executives include significant amounts of stock and come at the end of a long career.
"This is a phenomenal unrisked return for the head of a quasipublic organization," said Charles M. Elson, chairman of the corporate governance program at the University of Delaware. "It's really a staggering sum because it's cash that was never at risk. It's mind boggling, more of an entrepreneur's fortune, and may well be more than the earnings of some of the companies that trade on the exchange."
An official close to the exchange board said Mr. Grasso's previous contract included a guaranteed 8 percent annual return on the portion of his compensation that he deferred each year.
Such a return, in a period of low interest rates, contributed to a sharp increase in his deferred savings in recent years. 
While the stock exchange would not confirm the return rate, a banker close to the board said there were sound economic reasons the board asked Mr. Grasso to rip up his old contract.
Mr. Grasso was traveling yesterday and unavailable to respond to criticism of his compensation. In a statement yesterday, Mr. Grasso said that he took the $140 million payments for financial planning purposes. "At this time," his statement said, "I thought it advisable in order to facilitate personal financial and estate planning to withdraw my accumulated deferred compensation, savings and retirement benefits, which are subject to full income taxes."
Sarah Teslik, executive director for the Council of Institutional Investors, an organization representing investor interests, said: "It looks as if the board is doing its job. They inheritedan awfully generous contract. It just does not look good to investors, regulators or broker-dealers to see that amount of money compiling at such a rate."
The exchange disclosed Mr. Grasso's salary and bonus details in tandem with its decision to award Mr. Grasso a contract that would expire in May 2007, replacing one set to expire in 2005. 
While the exchange has never formally disclosed Mr. Grasso's compensation, he is reported to have been paid about $12 million in 2002 and $15 million to $20 million in 2001. 
Such amounts led to an outcry, as they are more in line with what chief executives of public corporations are paid and are far above the pay of top officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission, NASD and even Nasdaq, a primary competitor to the Big Board. The New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest stock exchange, is not a publicly traded entity, and serves more as a quasipublic institution with an important regulatory function.
The disclosure comes as part of a broader overhaul effort under way at the exchange to bring its corporate governance practices in line with more rigorous standards.
Earlier this year, the exchange announced a wholesale shake-up of its compensation committee, which included the chief executives of Wall Street's top firms, among them James E. Cayne of Bear, Stearns; Henry M. Paulson Jr. of Goldman, Sachs; and David H. Komansky, formerly of Merrill Lynch. The leader of the committee was Kenneth G. Langone, director and founder of Home Depot, where Mr. Grasso was also a director. Mr. Grasso has said he will leave the Home Depot board.
All those executives left the committee, which is now led by H. Carl McCall, the former comptroller for New York State who is vice chairman of HealthPoint Partners, a private equity fund. Its other fresh faces include Herbert M. Allison Jr., the chief executive of TIAA-CREF, the teacher's pension fund. HealthPoint and TIAA-CREF are not regulated by the N.Y.S.E.
The committee has also started a formal review, according to Mr. McCall, in which it will scrutinize all the factors that go into determining Mr. Grasso's compensation, including the formula used to calculate his deferred compensation payout. It aims to announce its findings at the end of the year when Mr. Grasso's compensation package for 2003 is disclosed.
"What the board did was to agree to extend his contract and permit him to draw down the accumulated benefits over 36 years," Mr. McCall said. "We thought that it was important to get this out and disclose it. We are committed to complete transparency."
He added that the board remained happy with Mr. Grasso and that the new contract was signed to keep Mr. Grasso from leaving the exchange. 
"I think the board is very pleased with the leadership he has provided," Mr. McCall said. "We want to make sure that we retain his leadership at the N.Y.S.E." 
Despite the controversy, Mr. Grasso's supporters point to his leadership in the days after Sept. 11 and in the recent blackout. They say as well that under his leadership, the Big Board has flourished, doubling market capitalization to its current level of $14.8 trillion.
"After 9/11 people couldn't say enough about him," said Roberta S. Karmel, a former N.Y.S.E. director. "Deferred compensation can add up to a lot of money, but I think being chairman of the N.Y.S.E. has more similar aspects to being a corporate executive as opposed to a government regulator."
N.Y.S.E. officials say that Mr. Grasso accumulated the large sum by deferring significant components of his bonuses over the 20 years he has served as a top executive at the institution, starting in 1983 when he became an executive vice president and up to and beyond 1995 when he became chairman. 
Under the old contract, he would have been allowed to draw down his savings in 2005. But, with his guaranteed rate of return, his deferred compensation pool was growing at a much higher rate than would be offered by today's low interest rates. Accordingly, it was in the stock exchange's interests to redo his contract with a formula more in tune with today's financial environment. 
A banker close to the board said that Mr. Grasso cooperated fully with the board's proposal and asked that he be able to collect the payments now as opposed to 2007, the contract's end, which would be general practice.

HEADLINE: China's Growth Creates a Boom For Cargo Ships 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
Less than two years after many of the world's cargo ships lay idle and were worth no more than the scrap value of their steel, shipping lines around the world are enjoying one of their most profitable booms ever, and they have the rapid expansion of the Chinese economy to thank for it.
 China has become a ship line executive's dream. It is importing huge and growing quantities of oil, iron ore, coal and other bulky raw materials from the Persian Gulf, Australia, Brazil and Canada, and exporting rising quantities of furniture, consumer electronics, toys and other finished goods to American and European markets. 
 Shipowners and operators essentially measure their living by the tons of cargo they haul multiplied by the miles they carry it. By providing big cargoes that have to travel long distances, China offers a bonanza of ton-miles, as this measure is known, keeping ships so busy around the world that for some kinds of vessels on some routes, daily charter rates have tripled in the last year. 
"Now is one of the best times ever seen" in the shipping industry, said K. H. Koo, chairman of the TCC Group, a big Hong Kong shipping company. "China is the main thing that is helping the shipping industry."
The China shipping boom is driving up freight rates all over the world, not just on Pacific Ocean routes. For companies that need to ship their products by sea, the boom means higher costs. For consumers, though, there will probably not be any discernible effect on price tags in stores, because sea shipping is generally a tiny part of the cost of most goods.
Still, at a time of rising trade friction between China and the United States, the newfound prosperity of ship lines illustrates how a big global industry can become dependent on the Chinese economy in just a few years.
Nor are ships the only example. China is now the world's largest market for cellphones and color television sets, and the second largest for personal computers after the United States. Some technology stocks now trade as much on how the companies' sales are faring in China as in the United States.
Because computers and communications are the biggest users of computer chips, Intel announced today that it would build a $200 million semiconductor assembly and testing factory in China. "It is the fastest-growing market for us," Craig R. Barrett, Intel's chief executive, said in a telephone interview.
Yet a growing dependence on the Chinese market is a two-edged sword, making more industries susceptible to China's sometimes vertiginous economic booms and busts. Now that the Chinese central bank has begun trying to slow the economy gently without pushing it into recession, and trade and currency friction with the United States is becoming evident, few industries are as vulnerable as shipping.
With the development of China as the world's factory, its ports have become the biggest departure points for container ships, which carry finished goods like furniture and toys in standardized 40-foot-long steel boxes stacked high on their decks. The ports in the Pearl River delta of southern China now handle almost as many containers a year as all the ports in the United States combined.
Chinese ports are also the fastest-growing destinations for dry-bulk carriers -- freighters that haul commodities like coal and iron ore -- and for tankers. Though the United States still imports more oil by ship than China does, the Chinese reliance on Middle East oil is growing. As the output from its own aging oil fields has stagnated, the energy to sustain China's 8 percent annual economic growth has had to come from abroad.
But some ship line executives are nervous about how dependent their industry has become on the health of Chinese industries like construction and steel making. "If China stopped importing iron ore, the market for dry carriers would drop like a stone," warned George Chao, chairman of Wah Kwong Shipping Holdings, also of Hong Kong.
Low interest rates have fed a construction boom in China, contributing to a doubling of China's enormous steel output in the last four years, with many more mills still being built. Chinese mines have been unable to keep up with the demand for iron ore to be melted into steel, so China has tripled its iron ore imports since 1999.
These imports -- nearly 150 million tons this year, enough to fill the Louisiana Superdome to the roof 30 times -- come by sea, much of it from Australia's giant iron mines. But not even they have been able to expand output fast enough to meet all of China's needs, so the mills are now importing iron ore from Brazil, a monthlong voyage in each direction.
Long trips are keeping so many dry-bulk freighters busy that the cost to charter one from Brazil to China has soared to $46,000 a day, from $15,000 a day just last year, according to Tim Huxley, managing director of Clarkson Asia, a big ship broker. Daily rates for container ships have also risen sharply, he said.
Charter rates were briefly this high in 2000, when Western economies were at the peak of long-term expansion, especially in the United States. This time, though, China's dynamism has single-handedly driven up shipping rates even though the American economy is only starting to show signs of renewed vigor and European economies are struggling.
Tanker charter rates depend heavily on oil prices and on political stability in the Middle East; the usual late summer lull in shipments and the end of large-scale ground combat in Iraq have recently brought rates down. But in general, growing demand from China has greatly improved the long-term market for tankers, Mr. Huxley said.
Dry-bulk carrier rates have soared so high this year that they are starting to distort world markets for some commodities. A ton of coal costs less to mine in Australia than in China, but power plants in Japan and South Korea increasingly rely on Chinese coal because getting it requires only a three-day voyage, compared with 14 days from the Cairns, Australia, region, according to William Randall, the coal-shipping director at the Noble Group, a big shipping and logistics company here.
Likewise, the cost of sending a 40-foot container from Asia to the United States or Europe -- already much more expensive than going the opposite way -- has climbed an additional 20 to 30 percent in the last year, depending on the route, as Chinese exporters clamor for deck space.
"Everything comes back to how China is growing," said Steen B. Lund, the vice president for China at Maersk Sealand, a unit of A. P. Moller-Maersk of Denmark, the world's largest shipping company.
The growth of the Asian shipping market is also changing the ownership of the global fleet of freighters and tankers. While Greek, Italian, Belgian, Danish, German and Norwegian companies remain important and have many vessels in service on Pacific routes, Asian shipping lines now own 40 percent of the world's fleet. Events like the annual meeting of the Asian Shipowners Forum, which ended here today, have become increasingly important.
The fat profits coursing through the industry for the first time in nearly a decade are also starting to draw investment bankers, as shipowners see room for mergers and acquisitions. "There's definitely some interest in consolidating some of the routes" between ports, said Robert A. Morrice, chairman and chief executive of Barclays Capital Asia.
Previous shipping industry booms have tended to end quickly, with executives glutting the market by ordering too many new vessels. But the world's shipyards were already booked solid through 2005 before the latest China boom began, because of the need for new double-hull tankers to replace single-hull vessels, which are being banned for safety and environmental reasons.
The lack of shipyard capacity to build more dry-bulk carriers and container ships means that rates in these categories could stay high into 2005, said Rajaish Bajpaee, president and group managing director of the Eurasia Group, the Asian arm of the Bernhard Schulte Group, a privately held German shipping company that is among the world's largest.
Many shipping lines are privately owned and do not release sales or profit figures. But publicly traded lines have recently reported that their profits leaped in the first half of the year, especially in Asia.
The shipping lines posting improved results included two late last week, Neptune Orient Lines in Singapore and Orient Overseas International here, as well as Sinotrans in Beijing on Monday, and China Shipping Development and A .P. Moller-Maersk on Tuesday.
Despite the risks of financial troubles or trade wars involving China, most shipping executives seem to believe that, for now, trade with the mainland has brought them the prosperity that so long eluded them. "The times are good," Mr. Bajpaee said, "as they have not been in a long time."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: DIPLOMACY; 
U.S. NOW SIGNALS IT MIGHT CONSIDER U.N. FORCE IN IRAQ

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has signaled for the first time that it may be willing to allow a multinational force in Iraq to operate under the sponsorship of the United Nations as long as it is commanded by an American. 
 The idea was described by Richard L. Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, as just "one idea being explored" in discussions at the United Nations. It was first hinted at publicly last week by Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general. 
 Mr. Armitage's remarks, made on Tuesday to regional reporters and released by the State Department today, represent a potential shift in course for the administration, which has until now insisted that all military, economic and political matters in Iraq remain under total American control. Allowing the United Nations a leadership role would be intended to win the support of the Security Council for a new mandate authorizing the American-led occupation of the country. 
In his remarks, Mr. Armitage declined to discuss the plans in any detail, saying, "I don't think it helps to throw them out publicly right now." But he described the arrangement under consideration as "a multinational force under U.N. leadership" in which "the American would be the U.N. commander."
On Monday, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was asked whether he could envision American troops fighting under United Nations command. His answer: "I think that's not going to happen." But he went on to rule out only "a blue-hatted leadership" -- meaning by the United Nations, whose troops wear blue helmets -- over a peacekeeping force in Iraq. 
The Pentagon has historically opposed any arrangement in which American troops are not under American command, and Mr. Rumsfeld has expressed opposition to putting the current American force in Iraq under United Nations oversight.
But administration officials said the Somalian force in place in the early 1990's, however flawed from a political standpoint, might at least provide an administrative model. In that case, the United Nations force was put under the command of an American general, who maintained direct control of American troops. 
A State Department official said that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell had discussed the possibility of United Nations sponsorship with Mr. Annan at a meeting in New York last week. The official said the discussions had the full support of the White House, but said no decisions were expected until late September when foreign ministers gather in New York for the opening of the United Nations General Assembly.
A Western diplomat at the United Nations said today that there had been "contacts between London and Washington on how to move ahead in a way that is both achievable and useful and can make a practical difference." But, the diplomat said, the discussions are still too preliminary to make any accurate prediction if any draft text of a new resolution might circulate.
Whether any arrangement for United Nations sponsorship of military operations would be more than a fig leaf was unclear today. Pentagon officials would almost certainly resist any relinquishment of military command and control to United Nations authorities, but Russia, France and other permanent members of the Security Council might well seek some kind of a voice in decision making as a price for a new mandate.
The apparent flexibility on Iraq policy appears to reflect deepening concern within the administration about the unwillingness of many other countries, including France and Russia, to contribute troops and money to the American-led effort in Iraq. 
The United States still has about 138,000 troops in Iraq, and Britain and Poland also have significant forces there. But the mounting toll of guerrilla operations against the American forces has added to the pressures against them. Since the White House declared an end to major combat operations in early May, at least 64 American troops have been killed in direct attacks by Iraqi forces opposed to the American occupation.
So far, the White House and the Pentagon have resisted calls from lawmakers and others to bolster the American force in an effort to suppress the resistance. The administration is trying hard to persuade other countries, including France and Russia, to contribute troops to the operation, but many have said they will not do so unless it is given a fresh mandate by the United Nations.
To help win more financial backing, the United States is planning to convene a conference of donor countries in Madrid in late October, with a preliminary meeting planned for next Wednesday in Brussels.
But administration officials said today that in the meantime they expected the White House to ask Congress to allocate as much as $3 billion, on top of the $2.5 billion it had already appropriated, to help the American-led occupation authority cover its nonmilitary costs through the current fiscal year.
The total amount set aside to cover reconstruction and occupation efforts this year is about $7 billion, including the Congressional appropriation. But administration officials said that L. Paul Bremer III, the top American official in Iraq, had told Mr. Powell and other Bush administration officials at meetings in Washington this week that that fund was running perilously low.
In particular, administration officials said, the $1.7 billion in seized Iraqi assets set aside in a New York bank to cover emergency payments to Iraqi workers will be nearly exhausted by next week. They said they now recognized that, with Iraqi oil exports still running well below their prewar levels, oil revenues will not come anywhere close to covering the tens of billions that rebuilding and running the country will cost in the years ahead.
The cost to the United States of military operations in Iraq is currently about $4 billion a month, administration officials have said. 
In an interview published today in The Washington Post, Mr. Bremer said that Iraq would need "several tens of billions" of dollars from abroad in the next year to rebuild its electric, water and other systems and to revive its economy. He said that the cost of meeting the current electrical demand would be $2 billion, while a national system to deliver clean water would cost about $16 billion over four years.
The White House declined today to say whether it intended to seek more money from Congress for Iraq operations this year. "We'll listen to Ambassador Bremer to determine what his needs are," a spokeswoman, Claire Buchan, said in Crawford, Tex. 
But a top Republican lawmaker, Jim Kolbe of Arizona, who heads the House foreign operations subcommittee, said in a telephone interview today that the administration "needs to be frank with us and say what we need in going forward."
"What I think we're finding out is that the costs of repairing the infrastructure and replacing it is going to be higher than anticipated before the war, and we need to get on with it," Mr. Kolbe said. He said that his own visit last week had persuaded him that "we have a narrow window in Iraq, and it is important that we make substantial progress toward restoring the services there, or we're going to lose whatever credibility we have."

Hot Spots and U.N.-Managed Forces
The use of multinational contingents, authorized by the United Nations but not wearing the blue helmets of United Nations peacekeepers, came to the fore in the mid-1990's during the violent breakup of Yugoslavia. Its use has since spread, and there are currently at least six multinational forces in the field sanctioned by the international body.

LIBERIA -- The most recently created force arrived in Monrovia this month to build peace between government forces and two warring guerrilla factions. The force of 1,500, which is expected to grow to 3,250, is led by the Economic Community of West African States, or Ecowas.

AFGHANISTAN -- NATO, which has already provided more than 90 percent of the troops for the 5,000-member International Security and Assistance Force there, took over command of the force from Germany and the Netherlands two weeks ago, and put a German general in charge. The United States is one of 31 nations contributing, but, separately, has about 9,000 troops in Afghanistan.

CONGO -- An emergency contingent of 1,200 French, British, Belgian, Swedish and South African troops under European Union command arrived in June in Bunia in the Ituri region of northeastern Congo, after savage fighting between rival ethnic militias killed hundreds. The multinational force is due to depart by Monday, and the existing force of United Nations peacekeepers is to be expanded to 10,800 troops from 8,700.

IVORY COAST -- The French are leading a force of 4,000 of their own and Ecowas troops to quell a conflict that has it origins in bitter ethnic and religious divisions. Two French soldiers died this week in an attack by the rebel forces opposing the government.

BOSNIA -- In 1996, a multinational stabilization force was set up in Bosnia by a United Nations mandate. NATO leads the 12,000 troops, 1,900 of which are from the United States.

KOSOVO -- A NATO-led force of 50,000 troops from 30 countries -- including about 2,600 from the United States -- authorized by the United Nations, arrived in 1999. The 30-nation contingent has been slowly trimmed.

HEADLINE: Even Without Sears Card, Mayor Revels in Tax Discount 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg went to a Sears in Queens yesterday to publicize the city's week of no sales tax on clothing under $110. Of course, until the city and state moved to plug budget holes this spring, there were 52 such weeks a year.
 City and state officials reinstated the sales tax on less expensive clothing and shoes in June, after a three-year exemption. At the same time, they also increased the sales tax rate, bringing the combined sales tax in the city to 8.625 percent from 8.25 percent. 
 Still, the mayor was not one to let a technicality stand in the way of his shopping.
With journalists noting his every move at the store in Rego Park, Mr. Bloomberg headed straight for a rack of denim jackets with fake fur collars. He scooped one up, saying it was for his younger daughter, Georgina. It was $29.99, marked down from $40.
The mayor took it to the cash register, where a saleswoman, Carlene Edwards, was waiting to help him.
Was that all?
He replied, "I'm going to pay cash for it, so you'll have some real money." 
But when Ms. Edwards told the mayor he could get a $10 discount by applying for a Sears credit card, he changed his mind. He filled out an application, showed his driver's license, and provided his phone number and social security number to Ms. Edwards.
Then, after all that, the billionaire mayor could not be approved for instant credit and had to forgo the discount. So he handed over a $50 bill. The mayor's aides said later that he had been approved for a Sears credit card. "I assume that they checked him out and found that he has good credit," said Edward Skyler, Mr. Bloomberg's press secretary.
Even so, savvy shoppers will note that the mayor still saved $2.59 in sales tax.
"There's no reason that people should leave the city to go shopping for clothing," Mayor Bloomberg said at the store. "The best values are here, the best selection is here, and you don't have a long commute that would be expensive just to save a few bucks on sales tax."
But wouldn't New Yorkers shop at home if the sales-tax-free week were extended to the full year again?
The mayor replied that "we'd like to go back to it, but the fact of the matter is we need to pay for services." He also pointed out that the sales tax on clothing priced under $110 will expire in June 2004.
The mayor's shopping trip to Queens was the highlight of a busy day in which he returned to business as usual after a whirlwind trip to Israel. His private jet landed at Kennedy International Airport shortly before 5 a.m., and the mayor stopped off at his Upper East Side town house long enough for a shower and a shave, aides said.
Then he was en route to the Columbia-Presbyterian Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital, where he visited a police captain who had been shot in the stomach early yesterday morning. The mayor stayed about 45 minutes.
From there, he went to City Hall and was at his desk by 7:45 a.m. He was briefed on the legal battle with the state over the city's proposed bond sale, and then he found time to catch up on e-mail and paper correspondence before going shopping.
At the Sears store, several shoppers were already taking advantage of the sales-tax-free week, which began on Aug. 26 and runs through Sept. 1. Several of them stopped to watch the mayor make his purchase.
"It may not seem like a huge savings but everything adds up," said Terri Meyers, 25, an unemployed advertising consultant whose arms were weighed down by jeans and T-shirts. "The mayor would know that if he bought more than just one jacket."

HEADLINE: Venezuela Looks to the Ballot Box 

 BODY:
Recall elections poorly serve functioning democracies, as California's contortions amply demonstrate. In a country as sharply riven as Venezuela, however, efforts to organize a midterm referendum on the political future of President Hugo Chavez could result in a peaceful, democratic resolution of what is now a dangerous standoff. 
 Mr. Chavez is a democratically elected populist whose pugnacious remarks and divisive policies have split Venezuelans into bitterly hostile camps. His strongest support comes from the poor, who see him as the first national leader to look out for their interests. They point to his land reform, free literacy classes and government loans. His opponents, an odd mix of business groups, middle-class professionals and labor leaders, cite his failure to lift Venezuela's economy out of a recession, a 20 percent unemployment rate and a network of pro-Chavez community groups used to intimidate critics. 
 Anti-Chavez groups have twice tried to cut short his term by strong-arm methods. A 2002 military coup quickly unraveled. A lengthy general strike then inflicted considerable economic damage before collapsing earlier this year. The recall procedure, as spelled out in the constitution Mr. Chavez persuaded Venezuelans to adopt in 1999, is more democratic and legitimate. It can come into play now that Mr. Chavez has completed half of his six-year term. A newly appointed elections board must review the petitions submitted by Chavez opponents and, if enough valid signatures withstand scrutiny, schedule a recall referendum this fall. 
This solution through the ballot box, accepted in principle by both sides, could provide Venezuela with a way out of the present poisonous impasse, which threatens the future of its democracy and the livelihood of all its citizens. The stalemate cannot go on indefinitely. If Mr. Chavez fairly turns back the recall challenge, his opponents should accept the verdict. If not, he ought to depart peacefully.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: THE OCCUPATION; 
U.S. Seeking Foreign Investment for Iraq

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
American officials here are preparing an order that for the first time in decades would pry open most Iraqi industries for foreign investment, opening a new lifeline for an economy starved of capital during Saddam Hussein's government.
 The proposal, outlined in a memo by the top American civilian administrator here, L. Paul Bremer III, and circulated among the Iraqi Governing Council, is a step toward creating a relatively open economy in a region long protective of its domestic markets. 
 Aware of those sensitivities, the proposal excludes railroads, oil and natural resources, electricity, and water and sewage -- areas that are either linked to national security or that might inflame national resentment if opened to foreigners. The proposal would also permit foreign investors to take their profits out of the country, with no requirement to reinvest the money here. 
A number of Iraqi political leaders, while supporting the proposal in concept, have raised concerns that it would create an uneven playing field for Iraqi business owners. They fear that it would allow foreign businesses with access to capital and credit to set up shop in Iraq while doing nothing to help Iraqi entrepreneurs obtain the financing that could allow them to compete against new entrants. 
In particular, some members of the Governing Council say they expect Arab retailers from nearby Persian Gulf states to take advantage of the new rules early on, arriving with the money to finance nicer stores and bigger inventories than Iraqi shop owners, who have little or no access to credit. Other major industries in Iraq not exempted from the new proposal include food and agriculture, manufacturing -- including state-run enterprises -- and service businesses. 
The proposal also cuts strongly against the grain of the socialist economic dogma that dominated Iraq for decades. 
"Many on the Council have not overcome their fears about the need for protection," said Ahmad Chalabi, the Council member who is coordinating a committee studying the proposal. "The culture of the Iraqis has been a culture of fear that foreigners would take advantage of the country." 
But American officials say the step is an important one to rebuild Iraq and, in effect, democratize the economy. 
In the memo outlining the proposal, Mr. Bremer said that foreign investment would create more jobs -- with larger paychecks -- and introduce valuable technologies to the country. He also said he believed it would reduce the economic influence of wealthy businessmen allied with the Baath Party who profited from their ties to the Hussein government. Currently, those people control disproportionately large pools of capital, he said. 
Mr. Bremer wrote in the memo that the "future prosperity" of Iraq would depend in part on how successfully it could attract foreign investors. 
While the new rules may shape the Iraqi economy in the years to come, for now, practical decisions about investment are likely to be driven by the country's unstable security situation. In addition to attacks on American troops here, the rise of terrorism in Baghdad in the past month -- including a bomb that killed 17 people at the Jordanian Embassy and a truck bomb that killed 23 at the United Nations compound -- has also unsettled Westerners here. 
Would-be foreign investors occasionally get a personal glimpse of the country's security problems when they arrive: armed robberies are common on the main road from Amman, Jordan, to Baghdad, as bandits armed with Kalashnikov rifles routinely hold up convoys of arriving and departing Westerners. 
When Mr. Hussein was in power, investment by non-Arab foreigners was effectively barred both by the Iraqi government and by the international sanctions that followed the Persian Gulf war of 1991. 
Arab investors were allowed only a minority stake in a business, people who have studied the laws said. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development said $2.8 million in foreign direct investment flowed out of Iraq from 1997 to 2001. 
All of Iraq's neighbors enjoyed positive investment flows during the same period, the conference said, including Turkey, which saw foreign direct investment of $6.78 billion, and Saudi Arabia, with $4.69 billion. But those numbers pale when compared with some much smaller Western countries. In Ireland, for example, foreign investment of more than $60 billion flowed into the country during the same five-year period. 
Even though Mr. Bremer's proposal would end years of state ownership and closed markets, it still called for significant restrictions. In addition to barring investment in a handful of critical industries, the occupation authority and a panel of Iraqi leaders would have 60 days to reject any foreign investment of $40 million or more if they believed it threatened national security or if the investor had a "history of unlawful behavior." 
An investment of that size also could be rejected for other reasons, including a determination that the foreign company or investor had not demonstrated "how the project will affect national goals such as employment creation, the development of national infrastructure, and technology transfer, as well as the impact on the environment." 
Mr. Chalabi said some on the Council wanted other changes, including a mechanism for Iraqi businesses to obtain financing, which for most of them was nonexistent, so they could compete against well-financed businesses from abroad. Mr. Chalabi said the top American economic adviser in Iraq, Peter McPherson, met with a committee of Governing Council members on Monday and was "very amenable" to putting together a program to extend loans to Iraqi business owners. 
Council members are pushing for other modifications, including restrictions on foreign investments that do not lead to the creation of jobs, such as the speculative buying and holding of land in the hope of profiting from a rise in values. 
An official with the Coalition Provisional Authority, the civil administration led by the United States, said that the concerns about extending credit to Iraqi businessmen, and the rules for distinguishing between speculative and job-creating investments had been discussed among occupation officials and Council members. The concerns of the Iraqi Council members "were well taken and well understood," the official said. 
Some on the Council also want more certainty that people who profited under the old government would not do the same under the proposed rules. 
"We welcome foreign investment, that is for sure," said Adil Abdul Mahdi, senior adviser to Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, an influential Shiite member of the Council. "But we have to be sure there is no return of Baathist money," he said. "Many offshore companies have been created by ex-regime people," he said. He said he feared they could take advantage of open investment laws. 
Mr. Mahdi also said the proposal should not leave poorly financed Iraqi business owners competing against well-financed foreigners. "We have to be sure we are really defending the interests of the Iraqi people," he said.

HEADLINE: Workers' Strike Hinders Arrival of Yale Students 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
More than 2,500 of Yale University workers went on strike today as undergraduates began returning to campus, solidifying Yale's reputation as having the most contentious labor relations of any university in the nation.
 The walkout, the second at Yale this year and the ninth since 1968, was timed to maximize pressure on Yale's administration. But the strike had another effect, alienating some arriving students who had to navigate around the strikers and the police to move into the dorms. 
 "I think a lot of students start with an upper-middle-class sympathy with the strikers, but when they see the effect the strike will have on them, it might turn the students against them," said Daniel Koffler, a sophomore from Teaneck, N.J., who said the strikers' rally and police restrictions forced him and his parents to park several blocks from his dorm before unloading. 
As a result of the walkout by maintenance, food and clerical workers, many of Yale's dining halls will remain closed, phones at some academic departments may go unanswered, and there may be delays in cleaning some dormitory bathrooms. Adding to the inconvenience, when classes begin next Wednesday many professors are expected to move their classes off campus to honor the picket line.
"A lot of students think this will last all semester," said Joshua Foer, a senior majoring in ecology. "A lot of us feel, why can't they just reach an agreement?"
The two unions on strike and Yale's president, Richard C. Levin, are at loggerheads over pensions, wages and job security. Officials from the unions and the university say they fear the strike could last a long time because the two sides often seem to be talking past each other and because of the history of distrust between the two sides.
Yale officials say they have made an unusually generous offer, proposing wage increases of at least 4 percent a year to the clerical workers and pension increases to both unions of more than 15 percent, well above what many other employers have offered in recent years.
But union officials mock Yale's offer, contending that while the percentage increases may seem impressive, they leave the workers with unreasonably low pay and pensions.
"Their offer stinks," said Peggy Nelson, a maintenance worker who earns $29,000 a year after 19 years on the job. "I have three kids, and what they're offering isn't enough to support a family."
On Tuesday, the two sides held talks from 11 a.m. until 10 p.m., with New Haven's mayor, John DeStefano Jr., intervening in the final hours.
"Our offer is exceptional in this market," said Tom Conroy, a Yale spokesman. "It's exceptional in these times when you see we have free health care, when we help pay for their children's college education and we help pay for their home purchases."
Mr. Conroy said that despite the walkout, 59 percent of the clerical employees scheduled to work today reported to work. Union officials said only 40 percent did. Both sides agreed that at least 93 percent of the maintenance and dining hall workers had walked out.
For the workers, the highlight today was a rally by more than 800 strikers and their supporters in front of President Levin's office. Many wore T-shirts with the legend "Beep Beep, Yale's Cheap."
The main speaker was the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who led a march afterward to the office of Yale's chief investment officer.
"Today we march for economic justice," Mr. Jackson said.
John Wilhelm, president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union, the parent of the two unions on strike, said that for Yale workers who retired last year with 20 or more years' seniority, their average pension was $7,452 a year.
"Considering that Yale is such a wealthy institution, with an $11 billion endowment, members of our union ought to be able to retire without living in poverty," he said.
Yale officials praised their pension proposal, saying that under the latest offer, workers who retire after 30 years would receive retirement income, including Social Security, equal to 84 to 91 percent of their final after-tax wages.
The union said that it had proposed a 72 percent increase in pensions, and Yale a 14 percent increase.
In an effort to reach an agreement, the unions dropped a longstanding demand for Yale to let 2,100 graduate students use a streamlined technique to unionize by merely signing pro-union cards, rather than going through an election. For its part, Yale made slight improvements in its offers on wages, pensions and job security.
To the clerical workers' union, Yale has proposed a six-year or eight-year agreement, with a 4 percent raise in the first year, 5 percent in the second, and 4 percent raises in all other years. Yale boasts that its proposal would give most clerical workers an immediate raise of 14 percent, partly because their old contract expired in January 2002.
To the union representing maintenance and dining-hall workers, Yale has proposed a 3 percent raise in the first year, 3.5 percent in the second and 3 percent raises in all other years.
Mr. Wilhelm said the two unions had accepted Yale's wage proposal for the first two years. He said that the clerical workers' union wanted annual percentage raises of 6, 6, 6.5 and 7 percent in the last four years of a six-year pact and that the janitors and dining hall workers' union wanted raises of 3.5, 4, 4.5 and 5 percent in years three, four, five and six.
About 150 food workers at Yale New Haven Hospital also went on strike today.
On Friday, Howard Dean, Vermont's former governor and a Democratic candidate for president, is scheduled to speak in New Haven on behalf of the strikers.

HEADLINE: Revlon Running Near Empty 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
Revlon's heavy spending on overhauling its cosmetics brands has some analysts forecasting that the company will run out of cash early next year, unless Ronald O. Perelman, who controls the company, agrees to bail it out.
 Despite the efforts of Mr. Perelman -- and a flurry of chief executives in recent years -- to increase sales of lipstick, nail polish and other products, Revlon is not generating enough cash to make a dent in its huge debt load, say analysts who monitor what Revlon owes. Indeed, in its most recent quarter, Revlon spent $84 million more than it took in. For a company that has lost money for the last 19 quarters, that is not an encouraging sign. 
 "Barring another cash infusion, Revlon will run out of money during first quarter 2004," said George S. Chalhoub, a junk bond analyst with Deutsche Bank, in a report published this month. In the report, Mr. Chalhoub analyzed what Revlon's bonds might be worth after a bankruptcy filing. 
Mr. Perelman has already invested or agreed to lend Revlon more than $200 million this year to support a growth plan put in place by the chief executive, Jack L. Stahl, a former president of Coca-Cola. 
But unless Mr. Perelman contributes more funds, or the company attracts another investor, Revlon may need to restructure its $1.8 billion in debt next year, possibly through a Chapter 11 filing, analysts said.
Mr. Perelman's closest adviser, Howard Gittis, says a bankruptcy proceeding is not a possibility. "Under no circumstances is Revlon going to file for bankruptcy," he said. 
Revlon could be running out of time. At the end of January, it faces a deadline to negotiate with its bankers an extension of waivers to its loan agreement that require it to meet certain financial targets. Even if the banks are agreeable, in 2005 the company has $700 million in debts coming due.
In an interview earlier this week, Mr. Perelman disputed the analysts' projections. "I have not read their reports, but Revlon already has adequate resources to achieve the goals Jack has set out," he said.
Mr. Perelman, who controls 83 percent of Revlon, could afford to advance more funds to the company. He is worth $2.6 billion, according to the Forbes 2002 list of the richest Americans. He acquired Revlon in 1985 in a $1.8 billion leveraged buyout.
"I don't expect they will need additional cash, but if they are short $20 million or $30 million dollars, Ron Perelman will write a check," said Douglas Teitelbaum, managing principal at Bay Harbour Management, who owns Revlon bonds and says he supports Mr. Stahl's management.
"He's put so much money into this company already and this is a marquee asset for him," he said of Mr. Perelman.
The chief executive, Mr. Stahl, also remains confident, pointing to recent gains in market share as evidence that his spending is paying off. The company spent heavily on advertising, including ads featuring the actress Halle Berry. He has also set up new displays in drugstores and other mass merchants, and pulled some older products from the shelves. 
Revlon's share of the cosmetics market is up 0.4 percentage point for the four weeks that ended in July, to 22.6 percent, according to data from ACNielsen provided by Revlon.
"As long as we can begin to demonstrate some results, I believe we will have access to resources," Mr. Stahl said.
But analysts fret that Mr. Stahl's promotions cost a lot of money. "They are spending cash at a very alarming rate," said Terrence Dwyer, an analyst with KDP Investment Advisors, who predicts Revlon will rework its debts within the next 12 to 18 months. 
Revlon has taken charges against its earnings of $130 million since the fourth quarter of 2002 to cover one-time costs relating to the restructuring, and the company expects to take another $30 million in charges by early next year, according to Mr. Stahl.
In the second quarter, Revlon's sales rose 4.6 percent from a year earlier. But Revlon lost 68 cents a share, and cash flow dropped 43 percent from the period a year earlier. 
Revlon's shares closed yesterday at just $3.10, a long way from the $53 a share of April 1998.
Much of its $1.8 billion in bonds and bank debt trades at substantial discounts, with the largest issue, $650 million in senior subordinated notes due in 2008, bid at just 48 cents on the dollar, traders said.
While the company is gaining on competitors like L'Oreal and Procter & Gamble, Revlon's comeback efforts have been hurt by weakness in cosmetics sales over all this year, as consumers nervous about the economy cut back on spending. Cosmetic sales were down 0.5 percent in the 52 weeks ended July 13, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to Information Resources Inc.
Revlon also faces the deadline in January to negotiate with its lenders, who must decide whether to reinstate certain conditions of their $250 million credit agreement with Revlon, which requires the company to meet certain financial targets.
Spokesmen for Revlon's two lead banks, Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, declined to comment about what the lenders are likely to do. But an executive at one bank that holds some of Revlon's debt said there was a chance the bankers could be persuaded to give the company some more time if Mr. Stahl continued to show progress.
"The business has had trouble in the past, but they've always been responsive in trying to fix it," the executive said of Mr. Perelman and his team.
Mr. Perelman has bet big on Mr. Stahl's management skills. Earlier this year, he invested $41 million as part of a $50 million rights offering by the company that allowed stockholders to purchase more shares at a discount. And he agreed to lend the company $165 million.
Mr. Stahl also has a lot at stake. He has purchased more than 200,000 shares of Revlon stock, and received options for 500,000 more shares. He also got a grant of one million shares of restricted stock, which vests in three increments, when the stock reaches $20, $25 and $30 a share.
Mr. Perelman's advance of cash to Revlon this year is the second instance in recent years of his showing his faith in the company through his wallet. In December 2000, when Revlon was under the management of Jeffrey Nugent, whose mandate was to trim costs, Mr. Perelman spent as much as $250 million buying up bonds that were about to mature.
And Mr. Perelman could be persuaded once again to give Revlon some money, analysts said. "He seems to have an unending love for this business," Mr. Dwyer said.
Mr. Perelman agreed that he is still enthralled by Revlon. "It's the one business of ours that cannot be replaced or replicated," he said. 
Of course, there have been other companies that he has owned and happily sold, like Golden State Bancorp, a savings institution. Mr. Perelman owned nearly a third of Golden State; the company was acquired by Citigroup last year for $5.8 billion.
"You can never recreate the depth, power and reach of the brand," he said of Revlon.

HEADLINE: JOURNEYS; 
36 Hours Galveston, Tex.

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
 THE story of the crumbling but achingly beautiful port city of Galveston, it is often noted, can be divided into three phases: the architectural boom in Victorian palaces and ornate banking edifices that followed its creation as a prosperous trading outpost on the Gulf of Mexico, much of which was washed away by the devastating hurricane of 1900; a descent into a "triad of vice" of drinking, gambling and prostitution that gave Galveston a Big Easy kind of edge absent elsewhere in Texas; and a revival pinned on the expectation that urban renewal and a more sober tourism trade will pave the way to a brighter future. No doubt Galveston is recovering some of its luster since the days when the novelist Edna Ferber compared it to Miss Havisham, the old jilted bride of Dickens's "Great Expectations." Its shops and restaurants are bulging with tourists, and it is almost impossible to book a good hotel room for a weekend on short notice. The stunning design of its 19th-century mansions jump out at you, especially if you're arriving from nearby Houston where so many old structures were razed to make way for a futuristic skyline. It can safely be said that Galveston, an island city bathed in sunlight and a salty sea breeze, these days resembles a club-hopping teenager more than a bitter old woman. SIMON ROMERO

Friday

6 p.m.
1. A Very Stormy History

Soak up a bit of history over cocktails in the lobby bar of the Hotel Galvez (2024 Seawall Boulevard, 409-765-7721), named in honor of Bernardo de Galvez, the Spanish colonial governor who charted the coast of Texas and for whom the city was named. It was here that the gentry of old Galveston danced the night away in 1915 while a hurricane pounded the city, killing only a handful of people -- a success compared with the 6,000 who perished in the 1900 storm.

8 p.m.
2. Sushi and Hot Sake

Hop ahead a century, with dinner at Sky Bar (2107 Postoffice Street, 409-621-4759), a laser-lighted sushi restaurant recently opened by two Israeli entrepreneurs, Shlomi Padlon and Yoav Mor. This is the place to see and be seen while sipping hot sake ($6). Although the decor and ambience are reminiscent of SoHo, the service is down home -- friendly, helpful and encouraging for those with an adventurous palate. Start with baked mussels ($7.95), and move on to the "volcano seared" tuna ($12.50).

Saturday

8:30 a.m.
3. Walking the Wall

Every beach town is different, and Galveston is different from every beach town, or so the saying goes. What makes Galveston's beach special is not its murky brown water or narrow strip of sand, but its paved and elevated seawall, built to protect the city from the raging Gulf of Mexico after the all-defining 1900 storm. Stroll past exercise fanatics or revelers sleeping off last night's party, as a gulf breeze reminds you of Galveston's complicated and romantic relationship with the sea.

10 a.m.
4. Lone Star Surfing

Grab a paperback, some sunscreen and your flip-flops and hit the beach. Sunrise Beach Service (no phone number, just look for the bright red Ford pickup truck driving up and down the beach with equipment) rents umbrellas and two chairs for $18 a day and boogie boards for $5 an hour. Surfers -- yes, there is surfing in Texas -- often gather around the Flagship Pier near 25th Street.

11:30 a.m.
5. Symbols of Grandeur Past

Wander over to the downtown Strand National Historic Landmark District to gawk at a few 19th-century structures like the old Daily News building (2108-2116 Ship's Mechanic Row), the site of the founding of the oldest continuously published newspaper in Texas. It was designed by Nicholas Clayton in the early 1880's, when Galveston had cosmopolitan aspirations. The News building has a decaying appeal that captivated the photographers Henri Cartier-Bresson and Ezra Stoller, who caught the lost grandeur of the city in "The GalvestonThat Was," a book project underwritten by the late Dominque de Menil, who was Houston's great supporter of the arts. You might find a copy at Midsummer Books (2309 Ship's Mechanic Row, 409-765-5930).

Noon
6. Top Food, Low Prices

There are numerous restaurants in the Strand district, but the Mod Coffee and Teahouse (2126 Postoffice Street, 409-765-5659), an informal coffeehouse with excellent food, stands out. It's also cheap; the summer salad, with mixed greens, feta cheese, mandrin oranges, red onions and sunflower seeds in a balsamic vinagrette, costs just $6.25.

1:30 p.m.
7. Heritage a la Port

Walk down to the waterfront for a glimpse of the Elissa, a restored 1877 sailing ship berthed at the Texas Seaport Museum (Pier 21, No. 8, 409-763-1877 ). The smallish ship itself is perhaps a bit overrated, but the museum is fascinating with its exhibition of Galveston's seafaring past. Old photographs of stevedores and financiers and sailors help explain why Galveston differs so markedly from other cities in Texas and why its beginnings as an entryway for goods, ideas and people from around the world gave it such a cosmopolitan feel. Open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Admission is $6 for adults, $4 for ages 7 to 18, free for children 6 and under.

4 p.m.
8. Bettie's Palace

Get a glimpse of the past with a tour of the Ashton Villa (2328 Broadway, 409-762-3933), the 1859 mansion that set the standard for the later throng of palaces as Galveston became a lucrative go-between for the cotton trade. Built by a New Yorker, James Moreau Brown, and made legendary by his globe-trotting daughter, Bettie Brown, the villa provides a good example of the ostentatious ways of Galveston's elite in the 19th century (take note of the brass chandeliers). But you may want to skip the villa's paintings, mainly childlike imitations of Mediterranean grottoes done on corduroy and painted by Bettie Brown herself. All of the tours are guided, and from Labor Day to Memorial Day they are offered on the hour from noon until 4 p.m. Admission is $6 for adults, $5 for students ages 7 to 18 and free for children 6 and under.

7:30 p.m.
9. Cajun Calories

A visit to Galveston would not be complete without eating at Benno's Cajun Seafood, on the beach (1200 Seawall Boulevard, 409-762-4621). It's a Cajun seafood restaurant where it's best to throw all caution about calories to the wind. You order at the counter and sit at long, not-always-sparkling-clean tables that recall the days before Galveston got some of its recent polish. (There are rolls of paper towels at the end of each table to keep yourself from making too much of a mess.) A sampling of the menu: fish po' boy ($5.50); a cup of jambalaya ($3.75); corn on the cob ($1.50); and boudin, a sausage made here with pork casings, pork fat, chili peppers, bay rum, chives and rice ($2.95 a link). It suggests why Galveston seems reminiscent of New Orleans -- not only aesthetically, but culturally as well.

9 p.m.
10. Endorsed by ZZ Top

The Balinese Room (2107 Seawall Boulevard, 409-762-9696) is back! Known in the 1940's and 50's for its backroom casino, where oilmen rubbed shoulders with the likes of Frank Sinatra and Duke Ellington, the Balinese is back in business after Scott Arnold, a Houston lawyer, recently acquired the lease to the property. The croupiers are gone, but on a recent evening, the nightclub on the end of a pier extending 600 feet into the gulf was vibrant with a house band belting out covers of songs from the 70's and 80's. No wonder ZZ Top, the Houston-based band, wrote a song called "Balinese," with lyrics that went: "It didn't take too much money, man/ but it sure was nice/ You could dance all night if you felt all right/ drinking whiskey and throwing dice."

Sunday

9 a.m.
11. The Burrito Brunch

Brunch on the patio of the Phoenix Bakery and Coffee House (2228 Ship's Mechanic Row, 409-763-4611) is a great way to start the morning. Try the breakfast burrito ($5.25) or fruit platter ($5.95). The Phoenix has big tables where it's possible to while away the morning in relaxed conversation.

10:30
12. A Romanesque Farewell

A proper detour before leaving Galveston is at the Ashbel Smith Building (south of the parking garage at the corner of 11th Street and Harborside Drive, tours available by calling 409-772-2618), on the campus of the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Affectionately known as Old Red and completed in 1891, the building in Romanesque Revival-style survived the 1900 storm and still serves students and faculty today. Its ornate portico, three-story arches and detailed masonry show how they don't make 'em like they used to.

THE BASICS
Visiting Galveston
Galveston was once the grandest city in Texas. Now it is about a one-hour drive from the biggest, Houston, along a stretch of Interstate 45 decorated with billboards and an intriguing view of petrochemical processing operations. It is about 70 miles from George Bush International Airport in Houston. If you are driving from the airport, take John F. Kennedy Boulevard to Greens Road, and follow it eastward to Route 59 south. Route 59 will cross Interstate 45. Take I-45 southward directly to Galveston. An elegantly arched bridge connects the island of Galveston with the mainland. 
The Hotel Galvez (2024 Seawall Boulevard, 409-765-7721), built in 1911, gazes out at the Gulf of Mexico. Recently emerged after a five-year renovation project, it is back to its glorious self as seen in a stroll through the loggia connecting the lobby to Bernardo's restaurant and meeting rooms. The Galvez has 231 rooms. Weekend rates are $199 to $219, after Labor Day from $159 to $179.
Equally romantic and evocative of Galveston's history is the Tremont House (2300 Ship's Mechanic Row, 409-763-0300) in the Strand district. Weekend rates are $145 to $195.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
Folk Art Paradise Springs Back to Life

BYLINE:  By GRACE GLUECK

DATELINE: SHELBURNE, Vt. 

 BODY:
THE 56-year-old Shelburne Museum here, the most awesome folk art phenomenon in the United States, has been livening up in the last few years after a long fallow period.
 And phenemenon is the word for it: there is nothing quite like Shelburne in the museum universe. Founded in 1947 by the sugar heiress Electra Havemeyer Webb (1888-1960), the complex covers 45 acres of gardens and landscaped grounds, including 400 lilac plantings. With no central gallery, its objects are scattered among 39 separate structures; these include a Lake Champlain lighthouse, a covered bridge and the 220-foot side-paddle wheeler steamship Ticonderoga, now retired from lake duty and resting on dry land. 
 Each structure is a separate entity, some fitted out with collections, like a horseshoe barn and its annex holding 225 carriages; others, like the steamship, a show in themselves. The only departure from folk art is the imposing Greek Revival homestead built by Webb's children to house -- surprise! -- replicas of six chambers from her 18-room apartment on Park Avenue in Manhattan. 
Retaining their original furnishings, the rooms are hung with choice works by Monet, Manet, Degas and others from the group of Impressionist paintings left to Webb by her mother, Louisine Havemeyer, one of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's great benefactors.
But after more than 50 years of existence, the museum had lost its luster, lapsing into being a repository rather than an active showcase for its treasures. A financial crisis was resolved in 1996 when the museum sold at auction five French Impressionist works to provide for its future. The sale brought $31.1 million, allowing for the purchase of a Mary Cassatt portrait of Louisine and Electra as well as a windfall for the endowment.
The sale generated bad feeling and occasioned the resignation of Webb's son J. Watson Webb Jr. as chairman. (He died in 2000.) A fresh wind arrived with the appointment of Hope Alswang as president and chief executive in July 1997. Since then the museum has been working its way up to speed again, reflecting the goal Webb expressed in a letter in 1948, the year after she founded Shelburne: "I want it to be an educational project, varied and alive, that will instill in those who visit a deeper understanding and appreciation of our heritage."
Three shows that give new visibility to the permanent collection are up and running. The most dazzling of the three is "Art of the Needle: 100 Masterpiece Quilts From the Shelburne Museum." Shelburne, which owns more than 400 quilts, lays claim to being the first to display them as art rather than as decoration. With examples from the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, including more than 20 never before on public view, this show is quilt-lovers' heaven.
Organized by Henry Joyce, the museum's chief curator (and Ms. Alswang's husband), it represents three years of new research into the collection by the museum staff in consultation with Amelia Peck, associate curator and textile expert at the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum. The quilts are hung according to eight principal design themes: album, Amish, applique, chintz applique, pieced, Victorian (crazy and log cabin), white work and whole cloth.
Among the prizes are two "crazies": a similar pair made in the same family, by Delphia Noice Haskins (1816-1892) or her daughter Ada Haskins Pierce (born 1848). They are allover patchworks of disparate images sewn together every which way; cutout and stitched bits of cloth that make a heady mix of figures, portraits, animals and such, interspersed with scraps of geometrically patterned fabric.
A scintillating pieced number from the late 19th century is the "Flying Geese" quilt of pieced and tied silk whose scraps seem cut from men's cravats, arranged in an orderly but vivid scheme of triple arrows confined by squares. Electric blues with touches of other color add additional oomph.
In sharp contrast to these busy surfaces are quilts made by members of Amish and Mennonite communities, whose big, bold but simple geometric designs suggest Minimalist painting. A knockout example is the early-20th-century "Concentric Squares" quilt from Lancaster County, Pa., whose maker is unknown. A huge red square, marked by three successively smaller square frames of slate blue, with four tiny square motifs in the center, it creates a visual effect not unlike Op Art.
Other standouts include the "Major Ringgold Album Quilt," one of a notable group of album quilts from Baltimore made in the mid-19th century, whose characteristic equal-size blocks incorporate designs like wreaths, flowers and fruits. In this one, the colorful appliques on white include a depiction of a temporary memorial honoring Major Samuel Ringgold, killed in 1846 in the Mexican War.
Not quite as ambitious as the quilt extravaganza, but a worthy 3-D companion to it, is the exhibition "Red, White and Blue: American Patriotic Images" in the recently renovated Stagecoach Inn. It is a gathering of some 50 objects celebrating national pride, from many of the museum's departments: decorative arts, textiles, folk art sculpture, trade signs, toys and useful objects.
Purely for fun is the "Revolutionary Soldier," a carved and painted wooden toy from the early 19th century that may have been part of a set. Standing a little over two feet tall, looking endearingly fatuous, he wears a black three-cornered hat, uniform coat and white breeches and holds a rather innocuous sword, point down, in his right hand.
A more commanding presence is "Liberty" (1879), a wood pattern for making weathervanes; it is almost four feet tall, in the shape of a noble-looking woman in a flowing dress, left arm raised in a kind of salute and the right poised to hold a flag. Considered one of the finest folk art sculptures of the 19th century, the figure was used as a pattern from which an iron mold was made to stamp out metal replicas.
A ship's stern board of carved and painted wood, from the late 18th or early 19th century, makes another impressive showing. Squeezed into its lunette shape is an American Indian princess, symbolizing America, flanked by a tamed lion, representing defeated England, and a deer killed by an arrow, a symbol of American freedom (because in Europe only the aristocracy could freely hunt deer).
A version of Edward Hicks's "Penn's Treaty With the Indians" (about 1840) quaintly illustrates William Penn meeting with Native American representatives in Pennsylvania in 1681. One of nine known versions of the painting, it was bought by Webb, as were many other items in her collection, from the New York City gallery of Edith Gregor Halpert, one of the country's first folk art dealers. Halpert became a trusted adviser to Webb and eventually a trustee of the Shelburne Museum.
But although she liked the "Treaty," Webb had qualms about its $5,000 price. "I hate to pay that much for a Pennsylvania painting," she wrote to Halpert in the early 1950's. 
Smaller than the other shows, but a charmer, too, is "From Soup to Nuts: Preparing and Presenting Food, 1700-1830." Touching on European and early American menus, table settings, customs and etiquette, it includes place settings for a three-course meal with menu contributions from Paris, London and Salem, Mass., along with a men-only after-dinner drinking course from Boston.
A nice feature is a display of 17th- and 18th-century appliances like toasters and waffle irons, with their modern equivalents. Etiquette admonitions, posted on a wall, include one that warns not to smell your food before eating it. 
Ms. Alswang, formerly executive director of the New Jersey Historical Society in Newark, had spent time at Shelburne as an Electra Havemeyer Webb Fellow while in the University of Vermont's graduate program in museum studies. Under her direction, Shelburne has been researching, reinterpreting and reinstalling its vast collections -- more than 150,000 objects from four centuries.
The collections have been made more visible through an active schedule of shows and events. Ms. Alswang has improved accessibility through lighting and labeling, has encouraged exchanges with other museums and has made its premises more inviting by holding events like a bluegrass concert, a Native American pow-wow and a dog show.
Shelburne has also done more to charm children. A current show, "From 'Goodnight Moon' to 'Art Dog': The World of Clement, Edith and Thacher Hurd," for instance, displays the work of a family of book illustrators and is the first Shelburne exhibition to focus on the art of children's literature. 
One unusual project, started in 2000, has been the commissioning of houses as temporary exhibitions in an endeavor to show how American interior spaces evolved over four centuries. A 1790's log house was furnished with objects that visitors could sit on and handle. A 1950's ranch home, complete with a Studebaker in the driveway and Sinatra playing on the hi-fi, was introduced. In 2001 came the Collector's House, a 21st-century habitat for an imaginary collector, designed to show how folk art and contemporary architecture can live happily together.
Designed by a young architect, Adam Kalkin, it consists of a20-by-80-foot prefabricated steel building divided into a master bedroom, a study and a guest room, using three shipping containers as dividers. A pair of windowed garage doors form open-up walls on either side of the living room. A cantilevered balcony, and sailcloth curtains that can enclose or expose an outdoor garden and seating area, add to the house's interaction with the outdoors.
The interior designer Albert Hadley furnished the house with contemporary (but neo-traditional) furniture and examples of folk art from the museum's collection: 19th-century weathervanes, trade signs and duck decoys.
Also in 2001, the museum reinterpreted three 19th-century houses as permanent exhibits. Two more historic houses that serve as galleries will be upgraded, reinterpreted and re-presented by the 2004 season. 
Shelburne will close for the winter on Oct. 26, but it is making big plans for next season. Among them is the inauguration of public tours of the Brick House, Webb's 40-room residence a few miles away on 14 acres bordering Lake Champlain.
A comfortable family gathering place, the house also served as a proto-museum where Webb experimented with design arrangements and exhibition possibilities. (Among its treasures is the first folk art piece she purchased, to the horror of her Impressionist-oriented mother: a cigar store Indian acquired in 1907 when she was 19.)
To Ms. Alswang, Shelburne is more a process than a finished product. "The point is, we are always engaged in making ourselves better," she said. "We are always arriving, but never quite there."

"Art of the Needle: 100 Masterpiece Quilts From the Shelburne Museum"; "Red, White and Blue: American Patriotic Images"; and "From Soup to Nuts: Preparing and Presenting Food, 1700-1830" remain at the Shelburne Museum, Route 7, Shelburne, Vt., (802) 985-3346, through Oct. 26.

A Hamptons Question: Is the Ride Over?

BYLINE:  By WALECIA KONRAD

 BODY:
TRAFFIC and attitude. That's why Susan Duffy and her husband, Brad Miles, both public relations executives in Manhattan, are planning to put their three-bedroom house in the Springs section of East Hampton, N.Y., on the market.
 "When people ask why I'm leaving, I tell them a little story," Ms. Duffy said. "When I first bought the house 10 years ago, we used to go to a remote stretch of beach, and you'd park on a nearby dirt road. It was a very nice experience, and the beach never got crowded. Five years ago they paved the road where we parked, and in the last few years, you'd have to wait on line for a space. The last straw for me was a screaming match I had this summer with a woman who tried to jump the line. That just did it for me. That and the three-and-a-half or four-hour drive home on the L.I.E." 
 There goes another one. If the constant rumblings and the recent headlines are to be believed, Ms. Duffy and her husband are just two of thousands of people who have decided to flee the clogged highways, the overheated party scene and the inflated prices of what's been not-so-lovingly dubbed "Hellhampton." 
There were early signs that the summer of 2003 was not going to be the best of times for the Hamptons -- and that includes the weather. Many once-desirable houses were still on the rental market well past Memorial Day, and there was a nagging sense that the good times (that is, landlords becoming rich off Manhattanites' desire to swim in the Hamptons social scene) were over. An early spring editorial in the East Hampton Star foreshadowed the feeling with a warning about a bubble in Hamptons real estate prices. In August, New York magazine piled on with a cover story that read "The Call of the Catskills, Why So Many People Are Ditching the Hamptons and Heading for the Hills." 
To be sure, declaring that the Hamptons are finished is hardly a 2003 phenomenon. "Hamptons bashing is an annual event that starts every year around May or June," said Jerry Della Femina, the advertising executive who owns a restaurant in East Hampton. "If it wasn't for the bashing, the place would be uninhabitable. We depend on a certain amount of it to regulate the crowds." 
But there was something about this year that prompted Hampton boosters and haters alike to ask themselves, "Is this really it?" Maybe it was the controversy over whether gay men had a right to have late-night sex on a public beach in East Hampton (gay activists said yes; local residents said no; the police said maybe, if kept out of plain sight). Perhaps it was the mysterious draining of Georgica Pond, a freshwater pond near the ocean surrounded by multimillion dollar houses owned by Steven Spielberg, Calvin Klein and other celebrities -- that has local environmentalists up in arms. Or maybe the threat of some wealthy oceanfront homeowners to secede from the Town of Southampton and create their own village (proposed name: Dune Hampton) because they chafed at the town's new environmental rules for coastal properties.
"The combination of all these squabbles and the horrible weather really did make you wonder what was going on out here this year," said Geoff Lewis, a publishing executive who has rented in the Hamptons for the last 16 years. "But we benefited from the bad news. This year we probably got the best house we've ever had for a really good price." 
Good deals for renters meant that landlords felt the brunt of the bad feelings about the Hamptons this year. The market was flooded with rentals, houses offered by people who had bought in recent years with the idea of renting part of the season to help cover their costs. "On a dollar basis, we ended up making as much as last year on rentals," said Bill Williams, an agent in Devlin McNiff Real Estate's East Hampton office. "But many, many houses stayed empty this season -- especially three-bedrooms, which are the most common type of house out here." 
Mr. Williams said that he had seen a burst of new sales listings in the waning days of summer. That happens every year, but Mr. Williams said that a lot of listings were from people trying to put their properties on the market before mortgage rates go up. 
Of course, for some people, the Hamptons will never lose their allure, traffic jams or no traffic jams. John Brancati, with his partner, Bernard Green, has owned a house in East Hampton for 12 years. Mr. Brancati, a former vice president of Rizzoli International Bookstores, said that he was so bullish on the Hamptons that he moved out there full-time to run East End Books, which he opened this spring. 
"I absolutely don't think the Hamptons are over, or I wouldn't have started a business here," Mr. Brancati said. "This is a beautiful place to be with beautiful beaches and a wonderful quality of life. Where can you get a beach resort like this without high rises and hotels along the ocean? This type of lifestyle is pretty rare."
Geoff Lewis said that although "there's a sense that people are leaving," he thought the area remained strong. "You hear that people are selling to move to the North Fork or decamping into Connecticut, but I've never seen any firsthand evidence of it. My friends are still coming out here." 
Mr. Della Femina agreed. "I can count five people I know who have left the Hamptons since I started coming out here, and that goes back to 1987," he said. 
And a fresh bunch of celebrities seem to gravitate to the Hamptons each summer. This year's newcomers included the actress Renee Zellweger, who bought a two-story house in East Hampton (but has been pretty much absent from the social scene) and the "Sex and the City" star Kim Cattrall, who took up residence in the Springs and has been seen at every party in town.
There is more quantitative proof that the Hamptons are not over yet. On the charity circuit, a key barometer for Hamptons life, organizers of benefits said that this season was at least as strong as last year. Liz Dent, director of special events for the Nature Conservancy, said that turnout was quite good for the annual ball that she organizes. On average, she said, all fund-raisers have been down the last two years because of the economy. "We made as much as last year," she said, "which with this summer's rocky start is great news." 
And Mary Lynch, the director of the Hamptons Designer Showhouse, which raises money for the Southampton Hospital, said that the preview gala on June 28, one of the rare dry days that month, had a better turnout than it did last year, with far fewer no-shows.
But the real proof of where things stand in the Hamptons boils down to real estate. Brokers say the market had a sharp turnaround after the season's dismal beginning. "Offers and acceptances were off the charts for June and July," said Judi Desiderio, a vice president of Cook Pony Farm Real Estate in East Hampton. "Those months are normally dead, but it's like the whole season got delayed and then exploded."
Even the people who have thrown in the towel aren't willing to acknowledge that the Hamptons are over. "I want acres of land and a guest house," Ms. Duffy said, "and I know I can never afford that out here."
"But the beaches are beautiful," she continued, already sounding nostalgic. "The Hamptons will never really be over. There are plenty of people in line waiting to take my place."

BYLINE:  By Ishmael Reed; Ishmael Reed is author of the forthcoming "Blues City: A Walk in Oakland."

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif. 

 BODY:
This city has often been called the ugly stepsister of San Francisco. And that's partly true. The town has more in common with Mustache Sal, the character created by Bret Harte (a former Oakland resident), than with Jenny Lind, who once sang here.
 But when Gertrude Stein and her family lived in Oakland, it was known as the second Venice. There were mansions around Lake Merritt, the country's largest urban saltwater lake. Inside its park is Children's Fairyland, the inspiration for the Disney theme parks. One of the remaining mansions is the grand Victorian Camron-Stanford House, where President Rutherford B. Hayes and his wife, Lemonade Lucy, attended a reception in their honor. The mansion reminds us that Oakland was once a resort for the rich. When Gertrude Stein returned here on a lecture tour in 1935, the estates had been subdivided to accommodate the thousands of people who poured in after the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. Her childhood home had been demolished. For her "there was no there there," she was to write in "Everybody's Autobiography." 
 Despite the efforts of some earnest preservationists, the Camron-Stanford House has been allowed to decay while new condominiums -- high-rise trailer parks -- shoot up overnight. Mayor Jerry Brown wants to revitalize downtown by bringing in 10,000 residents of the kind who can afford high rents. He says he wants Oakland to be like Manhattan, but he isn't the first dude to try to tame this city. This planet city. Not "soft" but "husky, brawling" as Carl Sandburg wanted of cities.
I gained a fuller knowledge of Oakland's diversity -- in one district, the Fruitvale, at least 80 languages are spoken -- by spending my summer exploring the city from the waterfront, where Jack London and his friends got into drunken brawls, to the Chabot Observatory, in the Oakland Hills, where one of Einstein's telescopes is housed. I'd been postponing a visit to the observatory, but then my editor invited me to write a book about any city of my choice for a travel series. I chose Oakland, because I thought I knew a lot about this town. I was wrong. In what has turned out to be a remarkable summer, I discovered another Oakland, one buried beneath the lurid headlines, one dripping with rich heritage and a mosaic of cultures. I became acquainted with the fascinating details of landmarks that I'd passed by many times without a second glance.
Though crime waves are nothing new in this town where the first mayor, a Columbia Law School graduate, was a swindler and whose most prominent writers at the turn of the century, Jack London and Joaquin Miller (author of "Life Amongst the Modocs"), were a mugger and a horse thief, it would be a mistake to define this city by its crime rate. There is nobility just below the surface of this town that has acquired a grimy reputation.
The Peralta House is one of the reminders of Oakland's aristocratic past, when the favorite sport of the early Californios (children of the New Spanish who settled California) was bullfighting. It was built in 1870 by Antonio Peralta, whose father arrived from Mexico. The Spanish king granted him a spread that included Oakland and Berkeley. Another son leased some of his land to Horace Carpentier (born Carpenter), Oakland's first mayor, who violated the lease by selling the Peralta property to squatters. (One of his first acts was to ban bullfighting.)
The African, African-American and Caribbean communities contributed Carijama, a festival of arts and crafts and a parade in which the "saints" of the Yoruba religion march through the streets, accompanied by the sounds of steel drums (a neighborhood critic could only see "scantily clad women"). I attended a ceremony at Frank Ogawa Plaza, named for the late Japanese-American councilman, where Ramon Martinez was honored with a proclamation from Mayor Brown. Mr. Martinez arrived here in the 1920's. His orchestra, Los Caballeros, toured the region and entertained troops during World War II. He became president of the Pan American Club in the late 1930's and organized huge barbecues, fiestas and dances. The club became the United Americas Association and sponsored the first citywide Cinco de Mayo celebration in 1946.
Oakland is a town where one can step into different centuries within a few blocks. Preservation Park evokes the 19th century: 16 historic houses of the Victorian, Stick, Italianate and Queen Anne styles were renovated and moved there. They are home to artists, writers and organizations both profit and nonprofit. Sitting in the fantail of Franklin D. Roosevelt's yacht, the Potomac, where the president entertained King George VI and Queen Elizabeth and mixed martinis for his guests, I found myself in the 1940's. The Port of Oakland bought the vessel for $15,000 and with the aid of President Ronald Reagan and others, it underwent a $5 million renovation. Along the way on my tour, I sampled fine Oakland cuisine: Duck legs with pinot noir at the Bay Wolf, where the establishment dines; barbecue ribs at Everett and Jones; authentic Mexican food like they serve in Mexico City, according to Councilman Ignacio De La Fuente, who took me and my daughter, Tennessee Reed, to lunch in the Fruitvale. 
Oakland's poets gather at the Coffee Mill, on Grand Avenue, near another old-time California movie palace, the Grand Lake Theater (1926), which was restored down to the 5,000 light bulbs that grace its marquee. Oakland's hip counterculture book store, Walden Books, is on the same block. But the most popular Oakland verse is the blues. The Oakland blues sound of Texas and Louisiana origin has an international audience. When Oakland musicians perform, thousands of people show up, a sizable number wearing Stetson hats and cowboy boots.
Billy Collins has a poem somewhere that argues for vacationing in one's own neighborhood. The millions of Americans who spend millions of dollars on sightseeing tours abroad should try taking one in their own city and they might be surprised at what they uncover, because every city has hidden stories and even epics. Our beleaguered cities, whether soft or husky or androgynous, could use the revenue.
If I hadn't toured Oakland this summer I could have lived here for the rest of my life and not noticed that the author Amy Tan once resided in my neighborhood. So did the Black Panthers Huey P. Newton, Bobby Seale, Bobby Hutton and David Hilliard. They walked across Martin Luther King Jr. Way as they headed to Merritt College and influenced the course of Oakland history, helping to elect a black mayor, congressman and supervisors.
Of the three cities, San Francisco, Berkeley and Oakland, Oakland is the blue-collar city, reminding one of the old industrial towns of the Northeast. It is the city with the big heart, accommodating 200,000 earthquake survivors and starting a free breakfast program. Oakland is Buffalo with weather. And no matter how much the developers, who seem to be running the town, continue to abuse landmarks and erase Oakland's history, even threatening Preservation Park, the beauty of the place will endure. A beauty that was captured by the African-American writer William Nauns Ricks in his 1902 poem, "Night in California."
When the sun is sinking slow
Behind the mountains blue and white
And the mist upon the town is falling low;
When the mocker's sleepy note
Seems to stifle in his throat
Then to us in California, it is night

HEADLINE: High Cost of Occupation: U.S. Weighs a U.N. Role 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
In weighing a greater United Nations hand in the military occupation of Iraq, the Bush administration is acknowledging that the mounting costs of the operation, in both human and financial terms, are too great for the United States alone to bear.
 Until now, the "vital role" that President Bush has promised for the United Nations has been limited, by American design, to a marginal contribution. But now the American need for troops and dollars that only other countries can provide is prompting a real reconsideration of those old, narrow lines. 
 What broader mission might be worked out, including the possible United Nations sponsorship of a multilateral force in Iraq under American command -- the arrangement that the administration has said for the first time it might be willing to accept -- remains to be negotiated. In the Security Council, and in the administration itself, there remain deep divisions about the extent to which a broader sharing of the burdens in Iraq must go hand in hand with a broader sharing of power and decision making. 
But after four months in which the American occupation of Iraq has exacted a heavy toll, and with no end in sight, the new American approach to the United Nations can be seen as a call for help in the face of a politically intolerable arithmetic.
"We're 95 percent of the deaths, 95 percent of the costs, and more than 90 percent of the troops," Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat, said in a telephone interview today. "The costs are staggering, the number of troops are staggering, we're seeing continuing escalation of American casualties, and we need to turn to the U.N. for help, for a U.N.-sanctioned military operation that is under U.S. command."
With nearly 140,000 American soldiers still in Iraq, the military costs alone are running at nearly $4 billion a month, administration officials have said. More American troops have been killed since major combat operations ended than during them, at least 64 of them by hostile fire in a guerrilla resistance that shows no sign of dissipating.
And while the administration had hoped that Iraqi oil revenues might cover the cost of reconstruction, that optimism has faded to the point that L. Paul Bremer, the top American official in Iraq, said this week that the country would need "several tens of billions of dollars" from the United States and other countries in the next year to help in the rebuilding. 
To enlist outside help in footing that bill, the United States will convene an international donors conference in Madrid in late October, with a preliminary meeting scheduled for next week in Brussels. But many experts say it will raise little of the needed cash unless the United States offers donors a bigger hand in how the money is spent, whether that occurs through the United Nations or in some other way.
"It's hard to believe that the big donors will write a check to support an American occupation over which they have no control," said James B. Steinberg, who served as deputy national security adviser under President Clinton and is now director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
That the United States would want help from other nations in peacekeeping in Iraq and rebuilding its economy is not in itself a surprise; the administration made clear from the start that it hoped to enlist a "coalition of the willing" outside the United Nations, which it deeply mistrusts for its refusal to support the American invasion in the first place.
Indeed, even now, a multinational division is assembling in southwestern Iraq to replace the United States Marines, who are scheduled to leave in early September. The division is led by the Poles and will have brigades that are commanded by the Ukrainians and the Spanish. Other nations contributing troops including Bulgaria, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Mongolia, Nicaragua, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Thailand.
Apart from that force, however, what has been unexpected is the reluctance of other countries to send troops in substantial numbers to Iraq without a fresh United Nations mandate. And together with the burdens imposed by the continuing attacks on the occupying forces and the country's infrastructure, the result has been a heavier cost than the administration had foreseen. As recently as May, the administration had hoped by this fall to reduce its troops in Iraq to just 30,000, or less than a quarter of those it now expects to keep in place for the indefinite future.
Winning a new Security Council mandate is now seen as important enough an American goal that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell interrupted a vacation last week to travel to New York to meet with Kofi Annan, the secretary general. A mandate would allow American commanders to call on troops from countries like India and Pakistan that opposed the war but may be willing to contribute troops to a force if it is approved by the United Nations. 
Such a mandate might also open the way for the enlistment of a NATO force, including Turkey, Mr. Biden said today.
But it is far from clear whether the administration would be willing to make the concessions necessary to enlist the support of Security Council members like France and Russia, which have said a wider United Nations role in Iraq would have to include real power.

HEADLINE: Loan and Reprieve for Englewood Theater 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: ENGLEWOOD, N.J., Aug. 28 

 BODY:
With a musical flourish that included a performance of Mozart by the New Jersey Symphony and a political chorus of nearly 300 supporters of the bankrupt John Harms Center, the Bergen County Board of Freeholders voted on Wednesday to provide a $1.9 million low-interest loan to keep the center open.
 The money will come from a tax-exempt bond issued by the Bergen County Improvement Authority and will allow the John Harms Center, a 1,400-seat performance space, to reopen with a limited schedule by October. But a full season of performances is not expected until next year, said Frank Huttle III, chairman of the center, which will be rechristened the Bergen Performing Arts Center at the John Harms Center. 
 The loan was approved by a vote of 5-0, with one abstention and one member of the board absent. 
"What we accomplished was nothing short of monumental," Mr. Huttle said today, "and now we can go to the entertainment industry to get a world-class executive director and begin to rebuild something that is a major economic engine for Englewood and an asset to the entire county." 
Echoing that view was Lawrence Tamburri, president of the New Jersey Symphony, which draws many of its 20,000 subscribers from Bergen County. The John Harms Center is one of seven locations around the state where the symphony regularly performs. Continuing its performances at the center, Mr. Tamburri said, will encourage former subscribers to return and attract new ones. 
The vote by the freeholders, taken at an emergency meeting at the center, came nearly five months after the center's directors, citing a sea of debt and their inability to make a payment on a $2.4 million loan from Fleet Bank, voted to close its doors and cut its season short. In the flurry of activity that followed, a new board emerged, seeking to renegotiate the bank debt, raise funds from private donors and get an infusion of public money. 
The public money was the linchpin. Still, there was opposition from a Republican freeholder, Louis A. Tedesco Jr. of Little Ferry, who abstained from voting on the loan.
Mr. Tedesco said that while he supported the arts, he considered it "bad policy" for taxpayers to underwrite a loan to a nonprofit group. He suggested that holding the freeholders' meeting at the theater, bringing in the symphony to play and filling the hall with supporters was a way of pressuring him and other opponents of the loan not to sound a discordant note on Wednesday.
"It was a charade and seemed very political," he said. "We were playing into a stacked deck, but it is still a bad, bad policy to do this."
Valerie Huttle, chairwoman of the Board of Freeholders and the wife of Mr. Huttle, said there would be "minimal risk" to taxpayers. The loan will be guaranteed many times over by a lien on the theater building and on equipment, valued at $6.2 million by the Bergen County Improvement Authority, she said. 
In addition, Ms. Huttle said, the Bergen County executive will be able to appoint a member to the center's board, and the center will have to deliver annual audits to the county as well as quarterly unaudited reports.
Before the vote Wednesday, the center's new board members were able to meet county requirements that they negotiate a write-down of the Fleet Bank debt to $1.7 million and raise $500,000 in new donations from private sources.
Mr. Tedesco and Ms. Huttle said providing the loan for the theater would revive the long-dormant improvement authority. 
"Their mission is to assist nonprofits, and until the current administration it had done very little," Ms. Huttle said.
Mr. Tedesco agreed, but said Bergen County, one of the nation's richest, surely could have found corporate and other private backers for the center without having to risk taxpayers' money.

HEADLINE: Economy Shows Unexpected Strength 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The economy grew at a revised annual rate of 3.1 percent in the second quarter, the government reported yesterday, and the unexpected strength led economists to raise their forecasts for the rest of the year.
 Among the positive signs in the report were the continued strength of consumer spending; the rebound of capital investment by businesses; the leanness of business inventories, which fell; and a jump in corporate profits. A surge in military spending connected with the war in Iraq was also a big contributor to second-quarter growth. 
 Inflation, as measured by one of the price monitors included in the new data from the Commerce Department, is still low, showing an annual rate of only 0.7 percent in the quarter. Analysts said this low level should prompt the Federal Reserve to keep its target for short-term interest rates low until the economy was back on its feet. 
"So far the data have been pretty encouraging," said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, who said that third- quarter growth could now be as high as 5 percent, a full percentage point above his current forecast.
James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at J. P. Morgan, said, "We see a pretty nice story building up behind the scenes.
"What is impressive about this number is the strength of final demand," which grew at a 4 percent rate in the second quarter, Mr. Glassman said. His current forecast of 4.5 percent growth this quarter "should be higher," he said.
"When you see strong demand and falling inventories that tells you the business community has been surprised by demand," Mr. Glassman added. That means restocking of inventories should provide a lift to growth this quarter.
The 3.1 percent growth rate, which is adjusted for inflation, is up from the Commerce Department's initial estimate of 2.4 percent growth in the gross domestic product, which measures the output of goods and services in the United States.
That is a nice bounce in itself because it comes after two quarters of growth at an annual rate of 1.4 percent. Total nominal G.D.P. rose to $10.794 trillion in the second quarter.
The upward revision to the second-quarter rate was attributed mainly to higher consumer spending, stronger exports and a reduction in the estimate of imports, which subtract from G.D.P. growth.
Personal consumption expenditures, adjusted for inflation, rose 3.8 percent in the second quarter, up from an increase of 2 percent in the first quarter and the initial second-quarter estimate of 3.3 percent. Spending on business equipment and software rose 8.2 percent after a fall of 4.8 percent in the first three months of the year and an initial second-quarter estimate of 7.5 percent.
Private business inventories fell $20.9 billion, after an increase of $4.8 billion in the first quarter and an initial second-quarter estimate of a $17.9 billion decline. 
"When final demand is rising by 4 or 5 percent, inventories should be growing by $40 billion or $50 billion," Mr. Glassman said.
Total government expenditures and investment was up 25.5 percent in the second quarter, little changed in the revision but far above the 0.7 percent increase in the first quarter. Military spending rose 45.9 percent, up from 3.3 percent in the first quarter. 
The rise of 4 percent in final demand, which includes the sale of all domestic products, came after an increase of 2.3 percent in the first quarter and an initial second-quarter estimate of 3.3 percent.
Corporate profits continued their recovery, bolstered by the tax cut that the Bush administration and Congress approved earlier this year. One of the provisions increased the immediate depreciation write-off to 50 percent from 30 percent for goods purchased after May 5. The Commerce Department estimated that the new depreciation provision added $18.8 billion to after-tax corporate profits in the second quarter.
Adjusted for inventories and capital consumption, after-tax profits rose 15.9 percent in the second quarter, to $670.7 billion. This measure of profits is now up for three consecutive quarters, pushing up the total 17.4 percent over the previous 12 months. Mr. Glassman said that the ratio of profits to the total gross domestic product was back to prerecession levels.
"Earnings are growing faster than top-line growth," Mr. Berner said, "and that is good for future profits and for the hiring back of workers."
The Federal Reserve watches the inflation rate based on personal consumption expenditures very closely. The 0.7 percent increase in the second quarter is down from a 2.4 percent rise in the first quarter and the initial estimate of 0.9 percent for the second quarter. Without food and energy, this measure rose 0.9 percent, up from 0.8 percent in the first quarter but down from the initial estimate of 1.2 percent.
Because inflation is still so low, Federal Reserve policy makers are worried about the threat of deflation -- which is an actual decline in prices. For this reason, many analysts expect that the Fed will not even consider raising its benchmark interest rate, which is now 1 percent, until well into next year.
Because the new inflation data reinforced that expectation, bond prices rallied and yields fell yesterday. The report that initial unemployment claims rose slightly more than expected, to 394,000 last week, also helped pull Treasury yields lower.
While he is optimistic, Mr. Berner still warned that "we still have a lot of data to get through." He said that the economy faced some headwinds from higher interest rates, higher energy prices, weak economic growth abroad and continued reluctance by companies to rehire laid-off workers.
He is also worried that the data he is looking at is still more positive about the economy than many of the comments from corporate executives as they made their recent earnings announcements. "If people remain cautious too long that can become a self-fulfilling prophecy," he said.

HEADLINE: Mixed View of a Pact for Generic Drugs 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH; Saritha Rai and Nicole Itano contributed to this article. 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
The prospect of a trade agreement that would help give poor countries access to cheap generic drugs was criticized today by activists but welcomed as progress by some health officials in developing countries.
 "This is a step forward for the third world," said Alexandre Grangeiro, head of Brazil's AIDS treatment program. "Those countries with the most severe health problems don't have conditions to produce their own generic drugs like we do." 
 The deal, endorsed by a major committee of the World Trade Organization in Geneva though not yet finalized by the group as a whole, aims to balance the commercial interests of patent-holding pharmaceutical companies with the needs of developing countries to provide affordable medicines to their impoverished populations. 
Brazil's AIDS program provides 135,000 patients with a life-saving "cocktail" of antiretroviral drugs free of charge, something it can do because the country makes its own generic versions of some drugs in the cocktail and uses the threat of local production to force multinational producers to lower their prices on others. The program has halved the number of people dying from the disease since 1996. 
But Brazil and the handful of other developing countries, like China, India and South Korea, that can produce generic drugs have been blocked by World Trade Organization intellectual property rights rules from exporting them. That has left most poor countries dependent on expensive patented drugs to fight the world's deadliest diseases. The deal announced late tonight in Geneva is meant to change that.
Under the agreement, a country needing to import a drug would be able to ask the government of a country that produces a generic version of it to authorize one of its manufacturers to export it without needing the patent holder's permission. The requests would have to be made "in good faith" and "for no commercial gain," and the generic drugs would have to be packaged and labeled distinctively to prevent the importing countries from re-exporting them at a profit. 
Although the agreement is not limited to specific drugs and specific diseases, as the United States had once demanded, it does exclude several rich countries from importing the generic drugs, and it restricts some poorer nations' use of the imported drugs to cases of national emergency. 
Representatives of many nongovernment health organizations working in the developing world were highly critical of the deal, saying it made too many concessions to Western drug companies and set too many conditions for poor nations.
Celine Charveriat, head of advocacy at Oxfam, called the deal "largely cosmetic" and said it "will not make a significant difference to the millions of sick people who die unnecessarily in the third world every year." 
Others said that while the deal might seem to offer new opportunities on paper, few countries that produce generic drugs would likely be willing to risk the wrath of the United States by repeatedly breaking patents to help their neighbors. 
"It involves an awful lot of red tape," said Ellen 't Hoen, a spokeswoman for Doctors Without Borders in Paris. "The statement doesn't say it's not possible to import generics -- it says it's possible. But the list of conditions attached is almost as long" as the trade group's entire agreement on intellectual property rights, she said.
Nevertheless, Mr. Grangeiro said the deal vindicated Brazil's continuing fight to promote access to medicines for all countries. He predicted that it would help him bargain to lower the price of three drugs that Brazil must still import to make its anti-AIDS cocktail: Lopinavir from Abbott Laboratories, Efavirenz from Merck, and Nelfinavir from Roche. 
"Now we have legitimacy if we want to import from somewhere else," like India, he said. 
India's pharmaceutical industry, which has also challenged American and European companies over patents, reacted cautiously. 
Dr. Yusuf K. Hamied, the chairman of Cipla, a Bombay laboratory that caused a stir in 2001 by offering an inexpensive cocktail of generic AIDS drugs to humanitarian organizations in Africa, said the deal's "no commercial gain" clause should be replaced with a call for fair and reasonable pricing, especially since the drugs are generally distributed through health agencies and charitable groups, not sold at retail. 
"If the patients get the drug for free ultimately, where does the question of 'commercial pricing' come in?" he asked in a telephone interview. "And who is to determine commercial gain?" 
He said some multinational drug companies were guilty of "obscene pricing" -- for example, charging as much as $12,000 for a course of AIDS drugs that he said his company could match with generic equivalents for $300. 
"India, Brazil, Korea and China -- we all could do quite a bit in manufacturing drugs for national-emergency diseases in the third world," Dr. Hameid said. 
In South Africa, another country with a well-established local generic-drug industry, AIDS activists said they were worried that the Geneva deal could restrict exports to impoverished countries in the region, like Swaziland and Lesotho, which have alarmingly high AIDS infection rates.
This month, Aspen Pharmacare introduced a generic version of Stavudine, an antiretroviral drug, the first to be produced in Africa. It has asked South African authorities for permission to produce six more AIDS drugs, and says it hopes eventually to offer antiretroviral cocktails for less than $1 a day. The patent holders of the seven drugs in question have said that Aspen can sell them only in sub-Saharan Africa. 
"Because we've already started, we've already negotiated, we've already started making generics, and we've already started building capacity, it's not a big step for us," Linda Philip, Aspen's chief operating officer, said of the Geneva deal. "But for countries that don't have manufacturing capacity, it's a big step for them."

HEADLINE: Trading Needed Medicine 

 BODY:
The prognosis for a lot of sick people in the world's poorest nations, and for the health of the current round of global trade talks, may soon brighten considerably as a result of the Bush administration's retreat from one of its more unfortunate unilateral diplomatic stances. 
 The World Trade Organization appears ready to approve a plan brokered by the United States and four key developing nations that would grant poor countries relief from patent restrictions and allow them to import cheaper medications to combat diseases like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The United States alone had blocked such a deal last year, in deference to the concerns of the powerful pharmaceutical industry. 
 Credit the urgency of a deadline -- a key W.T.O. summit meeting takes place in Cancun next month -- and the tireless diplomacy of Robert Zoellick, the nation's top trade negotiator, with apparently breaking the deadlock. The plan now awaits final approval by the W.T.O.'s 146 member nations.
If the deal that Washington once opposed is approved, America's pharmaceutical industry and its allies in the Bush administration must not seek excuses to block its implementation. 
Trade rules already allow countries to bypass patent rights and produce lower-cost alternatives to patented medications when confronting serious epidemics. Most W.T.O. members have been pressing to extend this break to poor countries that are unable to produce their own cheaper generic drugs, but are in a position to import them. The issue is an important part of the current "development" round of talks, aimed at making the global trading system work better for the world's poorest. 
The United States gave up its previous insistence that the exemption from patent rules apply to only a few designated diseases. In return, it got more safeguards to prevent the inappropriate resale of these cheaper medications to developed countries. Only public groups can control the use of these drugs, whose shape, color and packaging must be distinguishable from those sold for profit in other markets.
If approved, a deal on drugs would clear the deck for the W.T.O. to focus at Cancun on agriculture, another area in which the developing world suffers from the intransigence of rich nations, which are reluctant to lower their barriers to farm imports and to stop subsidizing their own farmers. The United States' reversal on the drug issue will apply some welcome pressure on Europe and Japan, the biggest culprits on the agriculture front.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Buying Spurt in Last Hour Sends Leading Indexes Higher

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A subdued preholiday session on Wall Street yesterday finished with moderate gains after a last-hour surge of buying. Two leading market gauges, the Nasdaq composite index and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, closed above numerical benchmarks.
 Despite two upbeat economic reports, prices fluctuated in a narrow range for most of the session. Analysts attributed the market's tentativeness to concerns that an improving business climate had already been factored into higher stock prices. 
 "The market is the greatest forecasting tool out there," said Gary Kaltbaum, market technician for Investors' Edge Partners, a money management firm in Orlando, Fla. "Stocks have been forecasting these results."
Volume, though again low, was modestly higher. A total of 1.17 billion shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with 1.07 billion on Wednesday. 
Many traders and investors were on vacation. "This week usually is just dismally slow," said Thomas F. Lydon Jr., president of Global Trends Investments in Newport Beach, Calif., referring to the period leading up to Labor Day. "Trying to make something exciting about this week is tough." 
Nonetheless, the Nasdaq index closed up 18.05 points, or just over 1 percent, at 1,800.18, a 16-month high. And the S.& P. 500 again breached the 1,000 level, rising 6.05 points, or 0.61 percent, to 1,002.84.
The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average advanced 40.42 points, or 0.43 percent, to 9,374.21. 
Market breadth was positive, with advancing issues outnumbering decliners on the New York Stock Exchange by more than 2 to 1.
It was the fourth consecutive day of gains for the S.& P. and the third for the Nasdaq index, something that analysts found encouraging. When traders return from vacation, analysts said, the market could have greater momentum.
As investors "come back from a long weekend and get re-engaged with their portfolios," Mr. Lydon said, "they will realize the Nasdaq is at 16-month highs."
With the Nasdaq index moving higher, the Dow has lagged by comparison as traders moved assets into riskier, growth-oriented sectors.
Among yesterday's economic data, the Commerce Department issued revised figures indicating that the economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual pace in the second quarter, stronger than the 2.4 percent it estimated a month ago. It was the economy's best performance since the third quarter of 2002.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said new claims for jobless benefits rose by a seasonally adjusted 3,000 last week, to 394,000. But the fact that claims remained below 400,000, a level associated with a weak job market, offered hope that the pace of layoffs was stabilizing.
Better-than-expected earnings and the upgrading of individual stocks by brokerage firms also contributed to yesterday's market gains.
Dollar General rose $1.60, to $22.52, after reporting second-quarter earnings that surpassed analysts' expectations by 4 cents a share.
Kirkland's, a home decor retailer, climbed $1.40, to $18.55, after US Bancorp Piper Jaffray raised its rating on the stock to strong buy from outperform.
Among technology issues, the disk drive maker Western Digital advanced $1.98, to $11.48, on heavy volume. Broadcom rose $1.50, to $27.45. Intel, a recent gainer, added 28 cents more, closing at $28.30.

Treasuries Strongly Higher
(By Bloomberg News)
United States Treasury issues had their biggest gain in three weeks after the Labor Department's report on unemployment claims and another report indicating that inflation remained muted.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note gained 29/32, to a price of 98 21/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, declined to 4.41 percent from 4.53 percent on Wednesday. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond jumped 1 18/32, to 102 16/32. The bond's yield dipped to 5.20 percent from 5.31 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
Income-Limited Units in Greenwich

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
Construction is to begin next month in Greenwich on a four-story rental building that will include nine apartments with income restrictions, following a legal fight that the developer ultimately won after citing Connecticut's Affordable Housing Law. 
 The building, on an acre-and-a-quarter lot on West Putnam Avenue at Homestead Lane, will have 36 apartments. Nine of those will be reserved for people earning no more than 80 percent of the state's median income of $75,400 a year for a four-person family. 
 The developer, Timothy J. Crowley, who heads a company bearing his name, said that he had passed the site, bordering Port Chester, N.Y., for years en route to his office and thought it offered "a great opportunity" for multifamily housing. He said its corner location served as a transition between the commercial area along West Putnam Avenue and the residential neighborhood on Homestead Lane. 
While Mr. Crowley's company has built or renovated 700 apartments along the East Coast in the last decade, Greenwich Gate, as the $8 million rental is known, will be its first project in Greenwich. Financing for the project comes from its development partnership and from Commerce Bank.
In the last year, the number of all types of available rental residences in Greenwich grew to 753 from 661 and average rents dropped 21.1 percent, according to Shore and Country Properties. Amy Whitlaw, an associate at the Greenwich brokerage company, said rents in Greenwich averaged $1,400 to $1,500 a month for one-bedroom apartments and $2,000 to $2,200 for those with two bedrooms. 
Ms. Whitlaw and Mr. Crowley said that there was demand for newly built rentals. They are in short supply in Greenwich, where the rental housing stock dates from the 1950's. Mr. Crowley said he expected the building, which will also have garage and surface parking, to attract young professionals as well as empty-nester couples. 
When Greenwich Gate is completed by next summer, both its market-rate and below-market-rate one- and two-bedroom apartments will be 650 to 850 square feet. All the apartments will also have features like oversize windows, granite kitchen countertops and washers and dryers. Most will have balconies.
The below-market-rate apartments are to lease for $1,200 to $1,500 a month to people earning $48,256 to $60,320 a year, depending on family size. Under state law, the apartments will be rented to individuals or families whose income is no more than 80 percent of the median for the area or for the state, whichever is lower. The market-rate apartments will rent for $1,800 to $2,700, Mr. Crowley said.
In affluent suburbs like Greenwich, where single-family homes dominate, rental housing developments, particularly those offering income-limited units, are frequently opposed on the ground that they attract a transient clientele.
But the state's 1989 Affordable Housing Law allows developers to build more apartments than they would otherwise be permitted by zoning if they set aside at least 25 percent of the units at below-market rents. If a town with less than 10 percent of its housing stock affordable to low- and moderate-income people rejects such proposals, it is vulnerable to developer lawsuits and must prove that it would be harmed in some way by the development.
Mr. Crowley said he acquired the Greenwich Gate site in 1998 with an eye toward developing a project similar in size to one the town had approved in the late 1980's. While the earlier project, which was never built, involved a three-story building with 27 apartments, 6 of them below market rate, Mr. Crowley planned all market-rate apartments.
When Greenwich planning officials denied the plan for 27 market-rate apartments, which neighbors contended was too dense for the site, the developer unsuccessfully sued. 
Thomas Heagney, Mr. Crowley's lawyer, said the project was then redesigned to its current size, including the below-market-rate units. Greenwich again denied permission to build. Mr. Heagney said a second lawsuit was filed, this time under the state's Affordable Housing Law. The suit was decided in the developer's favor in February 2002.
Richard Bergstresser, Greenwich's first selectman, or mayor, said of the current project, "Certainly, it will add to the town's affordable housing stock." But neighbors, he said, remain concerned about its scale and the traffic it will generate.
Wank Adams Slavin Associates of Manhattan designed Greenwich Gate. Gerald F. Ruck, the project manager, said the building would be clad in stucco and rusticated brown brick to "be sympathetic with the area's older homes."

HEADLINE: A.F.L.-C.I.O. Begins Group For Workers Not in Unions 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Hoping to increase its political clout, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. announced yesterday that it was creating a novel organization for nonunion workers who agree with the labor movement on many issues and want to campaign alongside labor on those issues.
 Federation officials said they hoped the organization, to be called Working America, would attract more than one million members to lobby Congress and to join demonstrations on issues like raising the minimum wage and preventing the privatization of Social Security. 
 "There are millions of working people who would like to be part of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s efforts for social justice and want a voice to speak out and work to change the direction of this country," John J. Sweeney, the federation's president, said yesterday at a news conference. "Working America will give them this chance." 
Labor unions plan to send hundreds of people door to door in working-class neighborhoods to ask sympathetic nonunion workers to join and to contribute money.
The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations has begun pilot projects for the new group in Seattle and Cleveland. In Seattle, three people working for seven weeks signed up 1,200 nonunion workers to join Working America, with each canvasser enlisting almost 15 members a day. About half of the new members made contributions, labor leaders said, with those who contributed giving an average of $16.
"Many of these people are living side by side with union members, and many of them have the same concerns and will respond favorably on our issues," said John Ryan, executive secretary of the Cleveland Central Labor Council. "We will engage them in making phone calls, writing letters, putting pressure on public officials to support a working families' agenda."
The goal, federation leaders said, is not to raise millions of dollars for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s political war chest, but to get more Americans campaigning with unions on labor issues.
To attract members, the people canvassing in Cleveland and Seattle often discussed one of the main focuses for labor unions, the fight to overturn the Bush administration's proposals to strip many workers of overtime coverage.
Union leaders say the idea has potential because while there are 16 million union members nationwide, representing 13 percent of the work force, surveys have indicated that more than 40 million other Americans would like to join unions. But labor leaders said it was often difficult for these Americans to join a union because many employers fought organizing efforts.
"There are many more nonunion people with extremely pro-union attitudes than there are union people," said Richard Freeman, a Harvard University labor economist who has long urged the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to set up the "associate" union membership. "You can look at this as a way to influence the political system. For unions to move elections, they have to get these people involved."
People who join Working America would not be members of a specific union, but would join a new affiliate of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
At a meeting of the labor federation's executive council in Chicago, union presidents adopted a resolution on Aug. 6 approving the new group. The resolution said the group would not be workplace-based and would not deal with employers for collective bargaining, representing workers or handling grievances.
For years, union leaders have debated about setting up such a group. Advocates said it would expand labor's reach and strength, while opponents argued that it would distract from organizing efforts and was tantamount to admitting an inability to unionize many workers.
"They're looking for a cheap way to win strength," said Leo Troy, a labor expert at Rutgers University. "Attempts like this are only a diversion of their resources. It only further weakens them because they are diverting manpower and money from organizing to something that won't necessarily produce results."
Labor leaders defended the idea, arguing that Working America might advance unionization efforts by making unions more popular and more powerful politically.
They insisted that the effort would be self-financing and would not distract from other unionization drives. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. would provide money to hire people to canvass, they said, adding that they expected these people to attract enough members and contributions to pay for the canvassing.
"We've gotten a great response so far," said Steve Williamson, executive secretary of the central labor council for the Seattle area. "This is a great opportunity for a group of nonunion workers who don't have a voice and for our members to broaden and deepen their voice."

HEADLINE: Brushing Off the Party Crashers; 
Brooklyn Boss Celebrates Despite Corruption Inquiry

BYLINE:  By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
On board the party boat Bargemusic in Brooklyn on Wednesday night, the wine was flowing, the chicken wings were disappearing, and a man in a spangly red vest and matching sneakers was lip-synching the disco hit "Got to Be Real." Soon he urged the guests to give it up for the guest of honor, Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr.
 "Don't you know this man is the deputy speaker of the State Assembly?" the M.C. called out over a vamping bass line. "Don't you know he's the best? And since you know that Clarence Norman is the best, doesn't he deserve the best? If you believe that, put your hands up in the air." 
 Four or five of the 75 or so guests at the birthday-party-cum-fund-raiser lifted their arms limply. 
The D.J. looped a sample from a Martin Luther King Jr. speech over the music. The beat went on. 
Mr. Norman, the longtime (and, in recent months, heavily investigated) leader of Brooklyn's embattled Democratic Party, has not had much cause to celebrate lately. 
He and the party are being investigated on accusations that Democratic judicial nominations are for sale in Brooklyn. And Brooklyn's district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, has been scrutinizing Mr. Norman's use of campaign funds and party credit cards.
Though Mr. Norman, who turned 52 Monday, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, there are those who think he may not be having his annual birthday bash in a floating catering hall near the Brooklyn Bridge too much longer, at least not at the expense of party contributors.
But if this was Mr. Norman's swan song, his spirits did not seem to be sagging in the least as he slapped backs and clasped hands from a post in front of the iceberg lettuce salad. The creases in the slacks of his navy pinstripe suit were as sharp as the crocodile-skin pattern on his black dress shoes.
When his turn at the microphone came, Mr. Norman, who seems to have concluded that criminal charges are inevitable, felt free to take a few shots at Mr. Hynes, accusing him of turning against the very system that had put him in power and supported him in his ill-starred runs for statewide office. 
"Let me just make a confession for those of you who might happen to speak to the district attorney, Joe Hynes," Mr. Norman said. "There's been all this stuff in the newspapers. And know what my confession is? Clarence Norman and the Democratic Party, weare involved in politics."
"That's right!" several voices shouted.
"And if there's a crime in being involved in politics," he continued, "then we are indeed guilty!"
Mr. Norman's troubles did not hurt the turnout, either. About 150 people agreed to pay up to $125 for their tickets, and the night was expected to bring in $11,000 to $15,000 toward his 2004 Assembly campaign, said Bob Liff, a party spokesman. "That's in the realm of what you usually get," he said.
To be sure, fewer judges than normal turned out -- only a handful, party veterans said. When a short man with a mustache was asked by a reporter if he was Judge Arthur M. Schack of Civil Court, he replied: "Am I? I guess I am," and added, "I really have nothing to say."
But Teri Coaxum, a community specialist in Mr. Hynes's office who said she saw no problem with attending the party, said she saw a lot of new faces. "Usually it's mostly elected officials," she said. "Now I'm seeing all kinds, an array of people from different communities."
During Mr. Norman's 13 years at the head of the party, the biggest local Democratic organization east of Chicago, the once almighty borough machine has grown creaky. Some of the problems -- shifts in the political and economic landscapes -- are beyond his control. (Patronage jobs, for example, are much scarcer than they used to be.) His batting average at getting his handpicked candidates elected, especially judges, has been falling for years. 
Still, being the Brooklyn boss carries a certain weight, so when Mr. Hynes announced in April that New York State's party-controlled system of selecting judges was "nothing less than a sham" and that he was going to be the one to fix it, starting in overwhelmingly Democratic Brooklyn, he got plenty of attention. As details of the investigation have trickled out, Mr. Norman's name has come up again and again. 
Did he use the party's credit card to charge tens of thousands of dollars worth of clothing and meals? Did he routinely pressure local candidates into hiring his confidants and relatives as consultants? 
On Wednesday night, Representative Major R. Owens, a longtime ally, told the crowd that he was not impressed by the accounts. "Credit cards and dinner and taking money from another politician for the election -- all those things are routine, you know?" he said. 
Finally Mr. Norman, a tall, trim man with a long mustache, stepped up and went to work, like the lawyer, 11-term assemblyman, former boxer and son of a preacher that he is.
"What we see now is this new paradigm where we have what we call the criminalization of politics," he said. "If you ask a candidate who comes before you or a person who's running for office, 'Do you have the resources to run for office?' that's called a shakedown now. 
"We have party rules that say the county leader can, in essence, have a credit card and use that credit card in the advancement of the party's interests and activities," he continued. "And those are our bylaws. I ask you: guess who wrote the bylaws that govern that type of activity? Our district attorney, Joe Hynes, who has always been part and parcel of the Democratic Party."
(Mr. Hynes, a lawyer for the party for years, said yesterday through a spokesman, Jerry Schmetterer, that he had not written those bylaws. Mr. Liff said the party stuck by its account of what Mr. Hynes had done.) 
"In 1994," Mr. Norman continued in speaking of Mr. Hynes, "when he ran for attorney general, we were there for him. He was our guy, Joe Hynes. Remember that?"
"Yes!" came the response. 
"We knew he couldn't win, but he was our guy so we said, 'We're going to be with Joe Hynes.' " When Mr. Hynes ran for governor in 1998, Mr. Norman said, his campaign gave $25,000 to the Thurgood Marshall Democratic Club, Mr. Norman's home base in Crown Heights, to get out the vote. 
"He never asked how the money was broken down or who were the street people who got the money," Mr. Norman said to a chorus of "whoo's." "He knew how our Election Day operations were run."
Mr. Schmetterer said yesterday that Mr. Hynes's party ties were beside the point.
"It's not relevant who contributed money to the Thurgood Marshall Club," Mr. Schmetterer said. "The question before the special investigative grand jury," he said, is how the money was spent and whether it was spent lawfully.
Mr. Norman even broke a little news: Mr. Hynes, he said, had recently subpoenaed his travel vouchers and reimbursement requests for mileage from Albany to present them to the grand jury, although he said he could not see the relevance of that to an investigation into accusations that judgeships had been sold.
"People say you never talk about the D.A. when he's investigating you," he said, "but it's quite obvious that he has already determined what he would like to do."
When Mr. Norman closed with a promise to "speak truth to power," the room erupted in applause. Afterward, he was so buoyed that he blew out most of the candles on his cake before someone pointed out that the revelers had not even sung "Happy Birthday" yet.
After finishing his cake duties, Mr. Norman took to the dance floor with a glamorous barefoot woman dressed all in white, and when the M.C. shouted, "Come on, let's do it," Mr. Norman put his hands in the air.
His dance partner, Joyce Williamson, a retired health care attendant, was beaming afterward.
"He's a very good dancer," she said.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about legal troubles facing the head of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, Clarence Norman Jr., referred incorrectly to the amount of work done for the party by the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, who is investigating him. Mr. Hynes and party officials both say his work was limited to one task; he was not a longtime lawyer for the party.

HEADLINE: For City Council in Brooklyn 

 BODY:
Primary elections for New York City Council races will be held Sept. 9. Here are endorsements in two of the most competitive contests in Brooklyn: 
 34th District (Williamsburg, Bushwick and part of Ridgewood, Queens): A redrawing of the district to include a Queens enclave has residents there worried about being overshadowed by their Brooklyn counterparts. The incumbent, Diana Reyna, is trying to step out of the shadow of Brooklyn Democratic Party bosses and her mentor, State Assemblyman Vito Lopez. But after nearly two years in the Council, Ms. Reyna has still not come into her own. 
 Her opponent, Juan Martinez, is an educator who headed Community School Board 14 for seven years and now helps Hispanic nonprofit organizations deliver services. As the district struggles with issues of rezoning and affordable housing and some of the worst lead-poisoning rates in the city, it would benefit from the record of leadership and the independent voice he offers. We endorse Juan Martinez.
45th District (East Flatbush and Flatlands): In this predominantly West Indian section of Brooklyn, the primary battle is among a diverse group of four Caribbean-rooted candidates. The incumbent, Kendall Stewart, is a podiatrist from St. Vincent who has been fending off accusations that he is ethnically insensitive, unresponsive to residents and a bad landlord for a building he owns.
The most impressive of his challengers is Erlene King, a Guyana-born community leader who has worked as an immigrants' advocate and helped to increase H.I.V. and AIDS awareness. Ms. King, who was an aide to Mr. Stewart's predecessor in the Council, demonstrates a confident grasp of the issues and seems eager to work for improved services and economic development. Our endorsement goes to Ms. King.

HEADLINE: U. of Michigan Alters Admissions Use of Race 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

 BODY:
The University of Michigan unveiled an admissions policy yesterday that preserves affirmative action but applies it less strictly, without assigning any numerical advantage, or extra points, to minority applicants.
 The new approach, a response to the Supreme Court's decisions spelling out how race may be used in admissions, will bring the university in line with the bulk of smaller, selective colleges nationwide. It may also serve as a model for how other public universities can seek to create diverse campuses in a constitutionally permissible -- though significantly more expensive -- way. 
 For Michigan, the costs of the admissions process should rise by $1.5 million to $2 million, or more than 33 percent. It takes effect this fall. 
"Our fundamental values haven't changed," Mary Sue Coleman, president of the university, said in a statement in Ann Arbor. "We believe that in order to create a dynamic learning environment for all our students, we must bring together students who are highly qualified academically and who represent a wide range of backgrounds and experiences." 
When the Supreme Court affirmed in June the right of colleges to consider race in admissions, it rejected the use of a strict point system to do so, stripping away a tool some public universities have employed to sift through tens of thousands of applications. The problem with such an approach, the court found, is that for some applicants it can turn race into the decisive factor, instead of just one of many.
In response, Michigan has eliminated its point system, whether for judging academics, extracurricular activities, alumni connections or anything else. Instead, it says, it will peer more deeply into the unique circumstances of each student, making academics the priority while treating all other factors, including race, on a more or less equal footing. 
In the language of college admissions, the approach is called a "holistic review," and the university will have to hire more than 20 additional application readers and counselors, though it says the extra money is well spent.
"This is the lifeblood of the institution," said Paul N. Courant, the university provost, emphasizing that the new policy should achieve the same racial diversity as its predecessor, and perhaps more economic diversity as well. He added, "There is nothing duller than a classroom of people whose backgrounds and training are identical."
On the same day it rejected Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy by 6 to 3, the Supreme Court upheld the more holistic approach of the university's law school in a 5-to-4 vote, saying, "Diversity is essential to its educational mission."
In a briefing yesterday, Michigan's lawyers said they were confident that the new undergraduate policy was constitutionally sound because it essentially duplicated the law school's sanctioned approach. 
Michigan's opponents in the Supreme Court case agreed that the new policy adhered to the court's decision, which called for "individualized consideration" of the many traits that "contribute to the unique setting of higher education." But while the plaintiffs' lawyers said they had no immediate plans to challenge Michigan's new approach, they said its implementation would be closely watched. 
"The devil is in the details," said Curt Levey, director of legal affairs at the Center for Individual Rights in Washington, which represented the plaintiffs in the case. "The wording is good, but we're going to be monitoring to see how big a role race plays. They say they're going to do a holistic review, but we're going to be looking to see if they automatically put race above other factors."
Other opponents were more critical. In Sacramento, Justin Jones, policy director for the American Civil Rights Coalition, which has vowed to place an initiative eliminating state-sponsored affirmative action on the Michigan ballot next year, called the new policy "as shameful and as belittling" as the old one.
Though it still asks openly about race, the new application is longer, seeking more essays from students and more information from high schools. Mr. Courant speculated that "we'll know more about these students than any other class."
Without points, though, some amount of personal bias is inevitable, educators said. 
"In essence, it becomes a more subjective review," said Mabel G. Freeman, assistant vice president for undergraduate admissions at Ohio State University, in Columbus. Her office also used points until this summer. Doing away with that system will take "more staff, more readers and more money," Ms. Freeman said, though she is not sure how much more. 
Defenders of affirmative action applauded the willingness to increase admissions budgets when extra state dollars are scarce. 
Christopher Edley Jr., a Harvard law professor who served as special counsel to President Bill Clinton's review of affirmative action in the 1990's, said, "It's a very visible symbol to cautious institutions that there is a way to stay the course and that they need not cower in the face of continuing litigation or political threats."

HEADLINE: Hospitals Pressured By Soaring Demand For Obesity Surgery 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Doctors and hospitals across the country are scrambling to satisfy the booming demand for surgery that shrinks the stomachs of severely obese people.
 Dozens of hospitals are adding special operating suites for the procedure, called bariatric surgery, which attracted wide notice after public figures like Al Roker of "Today" on NBC, Sharon Osbourne of "The Osbournes" on MTV and Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat, had it done. Some bariatric surgeons are fully scheduled 12 months in advance, and hundreds of doctors have jumped into the field recently and started to advertise their availability. 
 Bariatric procedures -- meant for obese people who are at extremely high risk of severe health problems, as defined by a National Institutes of Health consensus -- surged more than 40 percent last year, to 80,000. This year, the number is expected to climb to 120,000, according to Frost & Sullivan, a consulting firm. Spending on bariatrics is approaching $3 billion a year, at an average cost of $25,000 for each procedure. 
With the number of people eligible for the procedures growing by an estimated 10 to 12 percent a year, bariatric surgery can be profitable for hospitals -- and even more so for surgeons. But the costs are a major concern for insurance companies and employer health plans. Surgeons say that some insurers routinely delay approvals.
"The companies throw up roadblocks," said Dr. James Rosser, a surgeon at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. "They keep requesting more information. Patients are left to really hound the insurance companies to get the approvals."
Doctors and patients, meanwhile, are putting pressure on insurers to lower the body-size threshold for paying for the operation for people who have advanced problems with diabetes and other weight-related diseases. That could triple the number of people potentially eligible for the operation to more than 30 million, a panel of medical advisers to the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield association was told recently.
One group having trouble winning access to treatment is the poor, among whom obesity is an especially acute concern. Doctors say that Medicaid programs in many states have been reluctant to pay for the procedures. At the University of California at Davis, for example, Medi-Cal patients face a 12-year wait for bariatric surgery, said Dr. Bruce M. Wolfe, a bariatric surgeon and professor of surgery. Medi-Cal reimburses Davis for the procedure at less than a third of the hospital's cost.
"Basically they're not getting access to the care," he said. "They will suffer the consequences of untreated obesity." 
Most bariatric procedures produce weight loss by restricting the intake of food. Part of the stomach is partitioned off and the intestines are rerouted. Afterward, many patients lose their outsize appetites. 
"Patients can eat smaller amounts and feel satisfied," said Dr. Alan C. Wittgrove, a San Diego surgeon who is president of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery. But there can also be unpleasant consequences: if they eat too much, patients may vomit. 
The procedure is approved for patients at the upper end of the body mass index, a measure of weight in relation to height. Under National Institutes of Health guidelines, widely followed by health plans, candidates must first try diet and exercise regimens. 
More than 10 million Americans, 4.7 percent of the population, are eligible for the procedure, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health.
In addition to the average cost of $25,000 for the surgery and associated services, lifelong follow-up is strongly recommended, adding to costs. "They need support groups, follow-up by nurses, exercise programs," Dr. Wittgrove said. Insurance companies often do not pay for these programs or for counseling, Dr. Rosser added.
For some patients, overall costs can be much more, up to $100,000, said Helen Darling, president of the Washington Business Group on Health. Her organization, which represents large employers, recently opened a campaign to encourage overweight workers to slim down. 
A spokesman for that campaign, Dr. Vincent Kerr, director of health care management at the Ford Motor Company, estimates that obese workers cost employers $12 billion annually in medical bills, reduced productivity, increased absenteeism and higher insurance premiums.
The National Institutes of Health, meanwhile, says that the annual costs of treating obesity-related conditions -- including diabetes, heart disease, osteoarthritis and breast and colon cancers -- are at least $120 billion.
Bariatric specialists say the surgery reduces those costs in the long run. Patients with Type 2 diabetes, which the N.I.H. said accounted for $98 billion of obesity-related costs, have normal sugar counts within a few days after the stomach bypass procedure, without medication, Dr. Wittgrove said. 
A recent study by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield association "confirmed that surgery is far more effective than diet and exercise in treating morbid obese patients," said Naomi Aronson, executive director of the association's technology evaluation center.
But the long-term payoff has yet to be proved, said Dr. Alan M. Garber, a health economist at Stanford University who is a member of the association's medical advisory panel. "Something of a leap of faith is involved," he said.
Health insurers will cover the cost only for patients who meet a long list of preconditions, partly based on N.I.H. criteria. Aetna, for example, requires that candidates for the procedure have spent six months in a diet and exercise program supervised by a physician.
"Insurance companies, unfortunately are somewhat schizophrenic about this procedure," Dr. Wittgrove said. "Some authorize it quite easily and are patient-friendly. They seem to get the fact that they are going to save money over all." But, he added, "other insurance companies want to put hurdles in front of patients rather than facilitate treatment." 
Some of the most active hospitals for bariatric procedures are in 
California, New York and Boston. But a number of hospitals in Indiana are adding bariatric facilities. And in Florida, "just in the last six months in my neighborhood in Coral Gables, six surgeons have begun to advertise bariatric surgery," said Dr. Eneida O. Roldan, a physician who is chairwoman of the American Board of Bariatric Medicine, an accrediting group.
Hospitals in New York State reported 4,670 procedures last year, up 50 percent from 2001 and more than double the 1,981 in 2000, said Karen Heller, a senior health care economist at the Greater New York Hospital Association. 
Dr. Rosser, the Manhattan surgeon, has personal knowledge of both obesity and bariatric care. A one-time high school football player, he later soared to 450 pounds on a 6-foot-4 frame. 
"I had sleep apnea, a very prevalent silent killer, and muscular-skeletal aches and pains," said Dr. Rosser, a specialist in laparoscopic surgery who does bariatric procedures with miniature instruments. "I could see the handwriting on the wall." 
He said he made "the maximum effort to lose weight for four years, but the weight came back." Two years ago, when he was 46, Dr. Rosser underwent the surgery. He has since lost 150 pounds -- and he shows his patients a video relating his story.
In California, Kaiser Permanente, the big health maintenance organization, is tripling its bariatric surgery capacity in the San Francisco area. "There has been a tremendous increase in demand in the last four years," said Dr. Michelle Caughey, physician in chief of Kaiser's South San Francisco Medical Center, which treats 420 bariatric cases a year. 
Kaiser recently added two centers nearby. Combined, they expect to handle more than 1,200 cases by the end of next year, she said. 
New centers like Kaiser's are big customers for special equipment. They buy beds four feet wide that can support "patients of size," who may weigh up to 1,000 pounds, said Lynne Sly, vice president at Kinetic Concepts, a bed manufacturer in San Antonio. With extras like built-in scales, the special beds can cost more than $20,000, or $170 a day to rent.
Sales of these beds and accessories have been growing 21 percent a year, another indicator of the trends in obesity surgery, said Dhiraj Ajmani, an analyst at Frost & Sullivan, the consultants.
Dr. Wolfe at U.C. Davis said that bariatric procedures were only "profitable by a small margin" for hospitals. Complications are frequent, and the procedures often require extra employees in the operating room, he said. 
But with demand so strong from patients, many bariatric surgeons are thriving, Dr. Wolfe added. 
"Morbid obesity is life-threatening, and surgery is the only treatment that works," he said. "The hospitals don't have much choice but to respond."

HEADLINE: COUNCIL CONTESTS: 18th District -- Bronx; 
Unions' Interest Ratchets Up the Intrigue in a Bronx Race

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Pedro Gautier Espada is 29 years old, and his current race for City Council in the Bronx represents the ninth time that he has campaigned for political or public office. And given a similar number of races undertaken by his father, City Councilman Pedro Espada Jr., the younger Mr. Espada has seen more than his share of Bronx politics.
 Indeed, there always seems to be an Espada running for some office in the Bronx. But never have voters had the experience of seeing one Espada substitute for another on the ballot. That is what occurred a few months ago in the 18th Council District, when the elder Mr. Espada, who is the incumbent, decided to pull out of his re-election race and have his son as the substitute on the ballot. 
 The younger Mr. Espada once served in the Assembly and represented an adjacent district in the Council until the end of 2001. But he has not faced a race like that waged by his opponent for the Democratic nomination, Annabel Palma.
Ms. Palma, 31, is a union organizer with 1199/S.E.I.U. whose first venture into elective politics has apparently touched a chord among labor groups. On any given afternoon, Ms. Palma's campaign headquarters is filled with many of the hundreds of campaign volunteers in what seems to be a crusade by labor groups to elect one of their own.
The Espada family is well known as a political powerhouse in the Bronx. The elder Mr. Espada operated a large health care clinic and employs hundreds of people, most of them voters in the district. The councilman and his son typically run against candidates whose major benefactor is the Bronx Democratic Party organization.
Indeed, over the years, the Espadas have become the archenemies of the Democratic Party, which took the unusual step of going to court to have the elder Mr. Espada expelled from the party after he announced -- when he was a state senator -- that he was planning to become a Republican and began sitting with Republicans in the Senate. (The elder Mr. Espada said he withdrew from the Council race because the party was resurrecting legal proceedings against him.)
But this race is different. Ms. Palma went to the Democratic Party for support after she had met with union leaders and neighbors. And she has the support of a wide range of Democratic figures, from Borough President Adolfo Carrion Jr. and former Mayor David N. Dinkins to the Rev. Al Sharpton. But what makes this race intriguing to many Bronx Democrats is that so many labor unions have become heavily involved.
And it is a district with a strong labor base in the electorate. Ms. Palma's union, 1199, which represents health care workers, has nearly 4,000 members who are registered Democrats in the district, and the Transport Workers Union and Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, two groups that strongly support her candidacy, have between them 2,400 registered voters.
Ms. Palma said that her appeal is largely due to the fact that she is not a professional politician and portrays herself as a working single mother. "I am just a regular member of this community," she said in an interview at her headquarters, whose walls are plastered with campaign data for volunteers.
"My focus in this race is on the fact that people here need jobs and that they want economic development and they want affordable housing," she said. "And those are the things I'm committed to."
She rarely if ever mentions Mr. Espada, saying that "the needs of the community are what's important."
Mr. Espada, however, describes his opponent as a "candidate who has been hired to take out another candidate," contending that Ms. Palma and the 1199 were retained by the Bronx Democratic Party to run against him.
He said he is eager to return to the City Council, where he served for four years before he was defeated in the 2001 primary, to focus specifically on education. "I particularly want to be involved in the reform of special education," he said. He said he also wants to ensure that affordable housing is available to the district, especially in areas like Parkchester, where development has pushed up housing prices and rents.
The race in this district, which includes Soundview and Castle Hill, is being eagerly watched. Mr. Espada, who is not participating in the city's campaign finance program, said his campaign has raised "somewhere between $30,000 and $40,000." He and his father have always waged well-financed campaigns with hundreds of volunteers.
Ms. Palma has raised $83,000 from 600 contributors (she has the third-highest number of donors of the more than 120 candidates in the program). And she has received an additional $77,500 in matching funds.

HEADLINE: Pact to Help Poor Nations Obtain Drugs Is Delayed 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization came close tonight to approving an agreement to help poor nations buy lifesaving generic medicines through new exemptions from trade rules, only to postpone the final decision.
 Shortly before midnight at the organization's headquarters in Geneva, its top negotiating committee recommended that the full council accept the resolution, and the full council immediately convened to do so. 
 But several countries asked for further clarifications, and the meeting was adjourned to permit them more time, several diplomats said in telephone interviews from Geneva.
"I think it is going to be approved, but we never got to the stage of discussions," said Nelson Ndirangu of the Kenya delegation. 
Representatives of Argentina and the Philippines said earlier that they were worried about several interpretations of the proposal.
The speed of these deliberations reflects the importance of the measure for developing countries that cannot afford the high prices of patented medicines for treating millions of their citizens who suffer from AIDS and other diseases.
This week, the United States reversed its earlier opposition and agreed to support the measure, a move that offered some momentum for the global trade talks being held next month in Mexico.
The poorest countries have campaigned for years for the right to buy inexpensive generic equivalents of advanced medicines patented by some of the world's largest multinational corporations, saying that intellectual property rights should not override the needs of poor people threatened by disease.
The organization regulates trade-related intellectual property rights, including those covering patented medicines.
Under existing rules, poor countries have the right to manufacture copycat versions of brand-name medicines in the event of a health emergency, by issuing what is called a compulsory license to a local manufacturer without needing the patent holder's permission.
Most poor countries, however, lack the ability to make such drugs, and the existing rules forbid exports of generic drugs by the few countries that can make them. The pending trade agreement would ease that restriction and permit nations like Brazil and India to export compulsory-licensed generic drugs to other poor countries under certain conditions.
"It is very disappointing," said Keith Rockwell, the trade organization's spokesman, in a telephone interview from Geneva early on Friday morning. "There is no deal; more consultations are required." 
The organization was on the verge of approving a new agreement once before, in December, but the United States single-handedly blocked the deal then, citing concerns from the American pharmaceutical industry.
To show good faith, the Bush administration pledged that it would not pursue unfair-trade complaints against countries that broke the existing rules to export cut-rate medicines to poor countries until a new deal was brokered.
But the other countries of the trade organization, including some of the closest allies of the United States, strongly criticized the Bush administration for obstructing one of the few international trade agreements that could be said to address humanitarian and economic concerns.
After weeks of intensive negotiations this summer, the United States changed its mind. A group of nations -- including Brazil and India, both of them large producers of generic drugs, as well as South Africa and Kenya -- worked out the deal with the United States that was recommended tonight for approval.
It offers new assurances that countries that produce generic drugs will not exploit the arrangement to increase exports of generic drugs to nations that are not poor and do not have a medical emergency, diplomats involved in the discussions said. 
In return, the United States dropped its demands for a sharp narrowing of the agreement to cover drugs for only four diseases and shipments to only a limited number of countries.
"The U.S.A. had its bluff called by the developing countries, and pretty much caved in," said James Love of the Consumer Project on Technology, a nonprofit organization that lobbied heavily for an agreement.
Medical and development experts said that the new agreement, if adopted, would break down a big barrier to providing lifesaving medicines.
"This gives us a big advantage if we eventually want to reach the scale of treating millions of people," said Joep Lange, president of the International AIDS Society, in a telephone interview from the Netherlands.
Mr. Lange said it was important for the pharmaceutical companies to accept the new measure and continue financing research into new treatments for the diseases.
While advocacy groups for AIDS patients were among the loudest voices campaigning for freer trade in generic medicines for the developing world, experts say the need is also great for drugs to treat tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases.
Officials of the American pharmaceutical industry said tonight that they were pleased with the deal, but that they would have no more specific comment until the trade organization as a whole reaches a consensus on it.

HEADLINE: Sad to See Summer End? Travel Industry Is, Too 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

 BODY:
Long lines at airports, car-rental counters and hotel registration desks this Labor Day weekend are of little consolation to the weary travel industry, which is already looking past them to expectations of another difficult fall.
 Analysts and executives said they feared that the travel industry's woes would return, even before the last summer-vacation suitcase is unpacked. 
 The sluggish business climate is simply too much of a damper to provide any hope that this summer's busy travel season has legs beyond this Labor Day, which falls on the earliest possible date for the holiday. Added to that are travelers' lingering fears over terrorism, the continued conflict in Iraq and the imminent resumption of security fees on airplane tickets.
"It is going to be a bit of a long winter," said John P. Heimlich, managing director of economics for the Air Transport Association, the airline industry's trade group. 
That might sound overly bleak, given that airplanes have been crowded all summer. There are exceptions: the hotel industry, in particular, has hopes that the trend toward increased room revenue, which began earlier this summer, will continue.
Officials across the travel industry note that leisure and business travelers are waiting far longer than they did in the past to book trips, making demand difficult to forecast and creating some optimism that things might turn out better than expected.
But Mr. Heimlich said he thought the spurt of business this summer was partly a result of pent-up demand by travelers who put off winter and spring trips because of concerns over the war and SARS.
Over all, Mr. Heimlich said he saw no imminent rebound in business travel, which is off 15 percent from 2000, which is considered the industry's peak year. Corporations have already set their travel budgets for the rest of the year, and if anything, are likely to cut back even further if air fares rise, or if companies' balance sheets look precarious, he said.
"Businesses don't just fly more all of a sudden; there has tobe a need," Mr. Heimlich said.
Robert W. Mann, an industry analyst based in Port Washington, N.Y., said the airline industry generally sets its schedules two weeks after Labor Day. The last two years, the industry has made steep cuts in fall flights. "It's safe to say everyone is very concerned to see what happens after Sept. 15; that's the bellwether," Mr. Mann said.
As airlines determine their schedules, car-rental companies in turn will adjust their own fleets to match the expected demand. Craig R. Koch, chief executive at the Hertz Corporation, a unit of the Ford Motor Company, said he was guardedly optimistic. "I think the post-Labor Day season will be kind of flattish," Mr. Koch said in an interview this week.
He added that the leisure travel market, which generally fizzles after Labor Day weekend and does not pick up again until Thanksgiving, is showing some buoyancy.
Indeed, revenue per available room, a crucial measure in the industry, has risen in eight of the last nine weeks, according to Jan Freitag of Smith Travel Research. "That is a very positive sign coming out of the third quarter and heading into the fourth," he said.
Michael J. Rietbrock, an analyst with Smith Barney, said that the industry's tight supply of rooms before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the halt to construction afterwards, could mean that prices would rise even more should demand be stronger. "We believe the stage is being set for a sustained recovery in the hotel business," Mr. Rietbrock said.
Sue A. Brush, senior vice president of Westin Hotels and Resorts North America, a unit of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., was also optimistic about the outlook for corporate travel. Westin's revenues are up 2 percent in the first seven months of this year compared with the same period in 2002, she said, and she added that she expected business bookings to pick up this fall, after two straight years of decline.
September and October are traditionally Westin's strongest months of the year for business travelers. Ms. Brush based her prediction on a pickup in bookings by individuals, and by small business groups.
But, free spending is not the state of affairs in either hotels or rental cars. "People are traveling more than they were last year, they just aren't spending as much," Mr. Freitag said. Instead, he said, they wait to snap up last-minute discounts from Web sites.
Back in the good old days of three years ago, Mr. Koch said, business travelers boarded planes and rented cars regardless of the cost. "If you're going to make a commercial trip, you're going to make a commercial trip," he said of that era. But in today's weak business climate, "unfortunately, they're not going to make commercial trips," he said.
There will be even less justification for last-minute flying after Oct. 1. That is when the government will reinstate a fee of $2.50 per flight segment to pay for security costs; that fee has been waived since June 1. That might not sound like much, but for corporations with thousands of employees on the road, the fees quickly mount. "Even $2 or $3 a ticket means you won't make your profit margins," Mr. Heimlich said.
Regardless, the airlines, hotels and car-rental companies are all responding to forecasts of tepid travel with fare sales to international destinations like Hong Kong and London, and discount rates for hotels in New York and Las Vegas.
Major airlines have also canceled "use it or lose it" policies" that rendered nonrefundable tickets worthless if not used on the originally intended flight. Generally, customers have a year's grace period in which to rebook their flights.
But Kevin P. Mitchell, the chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, which is based in Radnor, Pa., and represents business travelers and corporate travel departments, doubted that the gesture would assuage many passengers. 
"They knew it was bad," Mr. Mitchell said of the airlines, speaking by phone from his vacation home in Annapolis, Md., this week. "They knew their best customers were angry, but they thought it would all be forgotten when travel came back and business surged." 
"But it did nothing to address other problems in the system," he added, namely, that business fares remain too high in relation to those offered by low-fare airlines.
As a result, the low-fare airlines like Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways now account for 25 percent of domestic air travel, a figure that Mr. Mitchell said he expected to climb. The situation has driven customers "into the open arms of the low-fare carriers," he said.
Mr. Mann said, "Travel managers are now incentivized to continue the trend to low-fare carriers."
There is a silver lining of sorts for some in the travel industry. Mr. Koch at Hertz said low-fare airlines were helping his company pick up business that has been lost because of the drop in travel on major airlines. A decision by one of the low-fare alternatives to start service to a new market, or to expand service to an existing destination, has an almost instant impact on Hertz's business in that city, he said.
Car-rental companies can respond almost overnight, by ferrying more cars to those locations. The problem is, it is hard to tell where consumers will go and what they will book when they arrive because so many are putting off trips until the last minute.
In any case, Mr. Mann cautions against betting on a burst of spending. "The consumer who carried us through the economic downturn is totally tapped, both on consumer credit and home equity line extensions, and interest rates are headed back up," he said.
That leaves the industry particularly vulnerable if concern about terrorism causes people to stay home. Mr. Mitchell said he was especially concerned about the impact on the jittery corporate travel market, should an attack take place at home.
"If there were another incident on a commercial airliner in the United States, it's game over, lights out," he said. "It's beyond a disastrous fall. It's over."

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by Times critics of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary, especially over the Labor Day weekend, and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

"A.I.M. 23," Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000 (through Sept. 28). Every year the Bronx Museum puts on a show of work by participants in its Artists in the Marketplace program, which teaches emerging professionals how to manage and advance their careers. Highlights of this year's exhibition include Jeongtae Chae's optically vibrating arrangements of found objects, Joe Fig's miniature recreations of painters' work tables, Kate Gilmore's video of herself as she tries to bring order to chaos and Hidemi Sato's obliquely poetic grids of photographs depicting brightly colored restaurant and gas station signs against blue sky. Hours: Wednesdays, noon to 9 p.m.; Thursdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $3, students and 65+; free on Wednesdays (Ken Johnson).

* "THE AMERICAN EFFECT: GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES ON THE UNITED STATES, 1990-2003," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Oct. 12). Exploring ways that artists throughout the world react to the United States as a superpower, this show of documentary films, videos, installations, photographs, paintings and objects by 47 artists and filmmakers and 3 collaborative groups runs from sunny side up to deep despair. There are reflections on America's military might, its industrial clout, its treatment of minorities, its consumerism, its justice system, its marketing strategies, its religious evangelism, its celebrity worship and its interference with other governments. On the other hand, there are more positive expressions of admiration for the freedoms, the opportunities and the material achievements of a country unfettered by ancient traditions. A wacky installation by a French artist, Gilles Barbier, in the form of life-size figures, offers a wry take on the United States through its aging comic book heroes, viewed in the setting of a nursing home and in the last stages of decrepitude. In a very different key is a video projection dealing with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas in 1963; the work, by a Serbian artist, Zoran Naskovski, is accompanied by a poignantly chanted tribute. The show has its weak spots but is provocative and visually compelling over all. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+ (Grace Glueck).

"ANSEL ADAMS AT 100," Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through Nov. 3). This exhibition of 113 of Adams's photographs, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of his birth, has been traveling around the world for two years. In these warehouse galleries it has a strangely random and homely feel. The photographs look small and lost. Maybe it's the setting. Maybe it's because the show, organized roughly thematically -- austere peaks, plants, peaks with plants, grand vistas, rocks -- doesn't have a clearly focused concept. Or maybe it's because the curator wanted to tamp down Adams's bombast and replace it with something quieter, smaller and subtler. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays to 7:45 p.m. Admission: $12; $8.50 for students and 65+ (Sarah Boxer).

* MAX BECKMANN, Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through Sept. 29). Like Beckmann, this retrospective of that German genius is dense, frequently revelatory and exhausting: all that heavy-handed symbolism and claustrophobia. Beckmann can seem like a truculent master, glaring balefully at us from his self-portraits, disappointed by our moral turpitude. It is easy to get bogged down in the miasma of his obscure allusions. But he also puts brush to canvas with surprising tenderness. Color is luxurious, not garish. The humor is sly and black. Finally, he is unavoidably compelling. Hours and admission: See above. (Michael Kimmelman).

* "BLACK PRESIDENT: THE ART AND LEGACY OF FELA ANIKULAPO-KUTI," New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Sept. 28). The Nigerian composer, musician and activist Fela Kuti (1938-1997) invented the musical style called Afrobeat, relentlessly assailed political corruption and repression in Africa and beyond through his records and performances and led a scandalous private life very publicly. This taut, vivacious exhibition is less about the man himself than about how 30 contemporary artists, most of them African or African-American, respond to his blazing, goading lodestar presence. Their reactions range from celebratory to critical, and few are simple, but his vision of a rejuvenated Africa still shines bright. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students, artists and 65+ (Holland Cotter).

"LOUISE BOURGEOIS: THE INSOMNIA DRAWINGS," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Sept. 21). In an eight-month run of sleep-short nights, the sculptor Louise Bourgeois turned the draggy hours to productive use, setting down thoughts, visions and memories that rose from the floor of her consciousness. What resulted are 250 drawings, considered one work by the artist, that range from simple to complex images: among them water, mazes, clocks, houses, abstract doodles, personal comments and fragments of texts. In short, a miscellany of clues to her inner and outer worlds, a scrap bag of images that may prompt her work. But while the dense, insistent visual environment they create is a bit of a phenomenon, the viewer does not really come away with a deeper understanding of the work, whose relationship to Ms. Bourgeois's deeply mined psyche is very evident in her realized art and in statements and interviews she has given over the years. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).

"CHALLENGING TRADITION: WOMEN OF THE ACADEMY, 1826 TO 2003," National Academy of Design, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through Jan. 4). The National Academy's conservatism is reflected in this selection of works by women who enjoyed membership since its beginning in 1825. Fewearly works rise above decorous academicism, and modest gentility prevails into the 1930's, when Clare Leighton made exquisitely refined wood engravings. There's more excitement in works from the last 50 years. Anne Arnold's ruggedly chiseled portrait in wood of the excellent painter Lois Dodd, Catherine Murphy's acutely observed painting of a sumac forest and Susanna Coffey's intensely compacted painted self-portrait prove traditionalism doesn't have to stultify. Hours: Wednesdays and Thursdays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $4.50 for students (Johnson).

"SALVADOR DALI: DREAM OF VENUS," Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700 (through Sept. 21). While images of the 1939 New York World's Fair in Queens remain ingrained in the American collective memory, one attraction, relegated to the "Amusement Zone," was largely forgotten until now: Dali's "Dream of Venus," a tacky Surrealist fun house with live, semi-nude women. This exhibition consists mainly of photographs that document the project from start to finish. Featuring the handsome, charismatic artist; his enigmatic wife, Gala; and lots of voluptuous, unclothed models, this show and its catalog tell a fascinating tale of idealism, opportunism, provocation and censorship. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 1 to 8 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 55+ (Johnson).

"DRAWN HOME: FRITZ VOGT'S RURAL AMERICA," American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040 (through Sept. 21). During the last decade of the 19th century, Vogt, a German immigrant, supported himself by making portraits of homes in upstate New York. A homeless itinerant who preferred to sleep in his patrons' barns, Vogt made wonderfully lucid, formally ingenious drawings of farms with multiple outbuildings and of elaborately decorated Victorian showpieces with manicured grounds. The 26 drawings here tap into an American ethos that elevated domestic prosperity to something like a national religion. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Admission: $9; $7, students and 62+ (Johnson).

* "EGYPT REBORN: ART FOR ETERNITY," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (permanent installation). The second and final phase in the museum's reinstallation of its world-renowned holdings of ancient Egyptian art, this dazzling display rounds up more than 600 objects -- from king-and-queen-size monuments to tiny rings and amulets -- from the predynastic period to the 18th dynasty. Viewing it together with the first phase, which opened in 1993 and covers later Egyptian art, visitors will now be able to trace the entire course of this brilliant and complex civilization from its beginnings to its absorption by the Roman Empire in 30 B.C. The heart of the new installation is an introductory gallery that provides a wonderful summation, with a survey of sculptural styles and displays of weapons, pottery, cosmetics, jewelry, furniture and funerary arts. The adjacent galleries are devoted to an extensive chronological survey. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3, students and 62+ (Glueck).

"ENTERTAINING AMERICA: JEWS, MOVIES AND BROADCASTING," Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Sept. 14). Marilyn Monroe's post-conversion mezuza and her music-box menorah are part of the lineup in this bustling roundup devoted to a century of Jewish presence in the entertainment world. A star-studded revue that takes the museum more than a step into show biz, it covers the 20th century from the early nickelodeons that preceded the Hollywood film industry to recent television manifestations like "Seinfeld," by way of film and video clips, audio tapes, photographs, posters and other artifacts. There is Al Jolson in "The Jazz Singer"; excerpts from Yiddish film and radio; Betty Boop, the sassy personification of a first-generation American Jewish girl from the Lower East Side; and pamphlets railing against Jewish prominence in the movie industry. There are also 10 "star shrines" that celebrate, mostly tongue in cheek, personalities like Sammy Davis Jr., Barbra Streisand and the silent film vamp Theda Bara (really a Jewish girl from Ohio). Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m.; Fridays, to 3 p.m. Admission: $10; $7.50, students and 65+ (Glueck).

* "FROM EXPRESSIONISM TO THE BAUHAUS: HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART," Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200 (through Sept. 15). Borrowed from the Museum of Modern Art, this economical, powerfully resonant exhibition of German Modernist artworks from the first third of the 20th century includes Expressionist paintings by Ludwig Kirchner, Otto Mueller and Emil Nolde; mordantly satiric New Realist paintings by George Grosz and Otto Dix; and sumptuously elegant utilitarian objects by Marcel Breuer and Marianne Brandt. Hours: Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7 for students and 65+ (Johnson).

"FROM PICASSO TO POLLOCK: CLASSICS OF MODERN ART," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Sept. 28). This selective anthology of perennial in-house favorites in a major museum has much to be said for it. The bait is irresistible, the promised classics turn up here and there, and both the young and the not-so-young have a fine time on the ramps. In addition to fine examples by Kandinsky, Picasso, Leger, Chagall, Kokoschka and Malevich, there is an enormous piece in ceramic tiles by Joan Miro. Begun in 1965 and finished in 1967, it is largely in black-and-white, but every touch of color sings out. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $9 for students and 65+ (John Russell).

* "HENDRICK GOLTZIUS, DUTCH MASTER (1558-1617): DRAWINGS, PRINTS AND PAINTINGS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 7). Goltzius was one of the hottest of hotshot Dutch artists. He was particularly celebrated for his engravings, many of them mythological tableaus of pumped-up gods and pinup goddesses, rendered in the Mannerist way with flabbergasting elan. But he was also one of the great draftsmen of his age -- his landscape drawings prefigure Rembrandt and Ruisdael -- and became a virtuosic painter whose primary subject was bare human flesh: its texture, its color, its chemistry. To some eyes he remains strictly a period artist; to others he connects to the present in interesting ways. This Met show offers the raw materials for both reactions. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Cotter).

* "GREAT WAVES: CHINESE THEMES IN THE ARTS OF KOREA AND JAPAN," Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1000 Fifth Avenue, at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 21). Basically a collection reinstallation with a novel mix-and-match approach, this show, spread over both the Chinese painting and Japanese galleries, traces the flow of influence from one culture to the other. Most of the action takes place in the Chinese galleries, where the art is arranged by motifs -- seascapes, landscapes, floral images -- that emerged early in China and circulated to Korea and Japan. The model proposed will provide grist for many scholarly mills in the future; the show itself is tremendous fun to look at. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).

JOSE ANTONIO HERNANDEZ-DIEZ, New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Sept. 21). Born in Venezuela in 1964, Mr. Hernandez-Diez is one of several urbane Latin American artists whose work might be described as a kind of vernacular conceptualism, a physically reductive, idea-rich art made from scraps of everyday consumerist life. His New Museum solo incorporates skateboards, household furniture, a stuffed pet dog, fake fingernails, baseball bats and photographs of designer sneakers, all put to unexpected uses. The results can be read in terms of local associations, but the real focus is on commonly shared experiences: appetite, rootlessness, faith and delusion, violence, the collective unconscious of globalized culture. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).

* "LANDSCAPE OF MEMORY: THE ART OF MU XIN," Asia Society and Museum, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400 (through Sept. 7.) The artist and writer Mu Xin, born into a wealthy aristocratic family in China, received a classical scholar's education and early exposure to Western culture. Targeted as a dissident during the Cultural Revolution, he was held in solitary confinement for 18 months, and he secretly wrote a series of first-person meditations now called "Prison Notes," which he carried out of jail sewn in his clothes. Under house arrest several years later, he executed a remarkable series of small landscape paintings in which traditional Chinese themes meet Leonardo da Vinci. The paintings and some of "Prison Notes" are brought together in this lean, penumbral exhibition, organized by the Yale University Art Gallery and the David and Alfred Smart Museum of Art at the University of Chicago. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; $5, students and 65+ (Cotter).

"LEGENDS OF OUR TIMES: NATIVE RANCHING AND RODEO LIFE ON THE PLAINS AND THE PLATEAU," National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700 (through March 7). This lively account of man, woman and horse among the native people in Western reaches of the United States and Canada proves that a cowboy can be an Indian, and vice versa. The show depicts native peoples not as objects of exploitation by the white man but as ranchers, cowboys, entertainers and rodeo performers. It displays more than 700 objects -- saddles, bead and quill works, paintings, photographs, blankets, clothing, horse gear, hunting implements, roundup equipment, headdresses and other ceremonial garb -- from the 18th century to now. At least half of this huge show provides an engaging and comprehensive account of rodeo, but nonrodeo fans will probably have more fun with the bedazzlement of objects depicting the more traditional side of American Indian life. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays until 8 p.m. Free (Glueck).

"MATERIAL DIFFERENCES: ART AND IDENTITY IN AFRICA," Museum for African Art, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700 (through October). Part Art Methods 101, part Advanced Connoisseurship, this handsome, thoughtful show examines the potent connection between matter and meaning in diverse African cultures and shows them to be organically connected. The material is spiritual in these cultures, and the show's 130 mostly ceremonial objects, arranged strictly according to materials and techniques, reflect the power of that belief. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students and 65+ (Roberta Smith).

"NOGUCHI -- THE BOLLINGEN JOURNEY: PHOTOGRAPHS AND DRAWINGS, 1949-1956," Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum (temporary space), 36-01 43rd Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718) 204-7088 (through Oct. 13). More than 100 photographs and drawings recreate Noguchi's travels from 1949 to 1956, on a grant from the Bollingen Foundation. The project was for an ambitious book (never completed) on the spaces and structures -- religious, monumental, classical and communal -- of familiar as well as less-documented societies. Besides providing an elegant travelogue, the photographs give some idea of the many sources that Noguchi drew on for his work. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 65+ (Glueck)

"PULP ART: VAMPS, VILLAINS AND VICTORS FROM THE ROBERT LESSER COLLECTION," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Oct. 19). This murky exhibition showcases the small, gaudy, largely unappreciated paintings commissioned for the covers of the pulp magazines that ruled the newsstands between the wars. While ultimately a bit repetitious, their overheated depictions of sharp-jawed heroes, compromised heroines and various human and nonhuman villains highlight talents like George Rozen and Paul R. Frank. They also give vent to the dark, violent, libidinous underbelly of the American psyche, to the same degree that Norman Rockwell's paintings bless its wholesome, repressed, preternaturally sunny side. The show is essential viewing for anyone interested in popular culture past or present. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

"REMEMBERING THE FORGOTTEN ONES: MILTON ROGOVIN," New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 (through Oct. 12). Mr. Rogovin, who is 93, has been photographing the residents of Buffalo's Lower West Side, a largely black, Latino and immigrant neighborhood, since the 1950's. Wonderful images have emerged: a benignly smiling elderly man pushing a baby in a carriage; alert kids dressed in cool street styles; a teenage mother standing with her infant in front of a wall bearing the chalk-written words "I love you God." At regular intervals, Mr. Rogovin has rephotographed some of his original subjects, and he displays the updates in four-picture sequences that he calls quartets. In them, couples marry and have families; change homes, partners and eras; gain weight, gain perspective, disappear. Sad, traumatic or sweet, these visual versions of oral history are the highlight of the show. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3 for students and 65+ (Cotter).

"USDESIGN 1975-2000," Museum of Arts & Design, 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535 (through Nov. 2). This survey of objects designed during the 20th century's last quarter is disappointing, partly because few of the products on view are very interesting to look at and partly because it sheds so little light on a field that has expanded in a mind-boggling variety of directions in recent years. Focused mainly on consumer goods like chairs, clocks, lamps, teapots, telephones, sneakers, ski boots, roller blades, sunglasses and computers, it has the feel of an outmoded department store. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays to 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5 for students and 65+ (Johnson).

"WILLEM VAN TETRODE: BRONZE SCULPTURES OF THE RENAISSANCE," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Sept. 7). This exhibition introduces a neglected Dutch artist who flourished amid the cultural ferment of 16th-century Italy, when the rediscoveries of monumental Classical marbles helped fuel a passion for mythological themes, the rise of private collecting and a new sense of physical and emotional drama in sculpture. Prodigiously talented, van Tetrode navigated his own path between Classicism and Mannerism with beautifully detailed bronzes, most notably a splendidly muscled and bearded Hercules dispatching various labors with violent panache. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $12; $5 for students; $8 for 62+ (Smith).

"VIETNAM: JOURNEYS OF BODY, MIND AND SPIRIT," American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, (212) 769-5100 (through Jan. 4). For many Americans who came of age before or during the 1960's, Vietnam was the name of a place you didn't want to go to. Even today the prevailing impression of this part of Southeast Asia seems to be a composite of remembered news clips and scenes from "Apocalypse Now." More than a quarter-century after the war, the image is due for revision, and that is the basic idea behind this show, a lavishly illustrated anthropological field trip through Vietnam today. Using objects, videos and photographs, it examines popular traditions associated with marriage, death and religion, often to vivid effect, in a lively, serpentine installation. And even with many important political and social questions left unasked and unanswered, there is a wealth of information here. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Admission: $12; $9, students and 60+ (Cotter).

Galleries: SoHo

* HELMUT FEDERLE, "Works on Paper," Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441 (through Sept. 13). From the mid-1970's to the late 1990's, the Swiss-born painter Helmut Federle extended his imagery from geometricized but lush mountain peaks to the freest of signs and markings. The 200 drawings on view here trace his progress. Although the work remains in a highly reductive geometricized mode, it is sometimes quirkily dreamy and sensuous, with more than a touch of whimsy. In these 200 drawings, which gain strength from being grouped together, Mr. Federle's many and varied passes at the paper range from the precise scientific textbook rendering "Constellation" (1983) to more relaxed and painterly grids like "Untitled" (1992), in which eroded bright blue bands are dragged across a white ground. He is a great performer; even his most fragmentary wisps hold the eye (Glueck).

Galleries: Chelsea

"BOYS OF SUMMER," ClampArt, 531 West 25th Street, (646) 230-0020 (tomorrow through Sept. 6). If you like to look at men, and you're passing by, stop in. Standing out among the crowd of pictures by more than two dozen photographers are "Bruce in His Car," a 1981 portrait of a skinny bohemian in his big red convertible by Nan Goldin; a beefy, shirtless young football player celebrating with his team, by Brian Finke; men in leather, by Barbara Nitke; and, by Malerie Marder, a large color image of a mixed group of naked people relaxing in a California bathhouse (Johnson).

* "IN FULL VIEW," Andrea Rosen, 525 West 24th Street, (212) 627-6000 (through Sept. 13). A show that invites visitors on a pluralistic treasure hunt for 18 artworks that tease one's limits of visual perception. Look for Christopher Chiappa's Ford Taurus gas-tank door built into the wall; Maurizio Cattelan's roosting stuffed pigeons; Vincent Shine's tiny, gold Brancusian wasp; Jim Hodges's jewelry-chain spider web; and Charles Ray's classic "Rotating Disc" (Johnson).

ANDREI MOLODKIN, Kashya Hildebrand, 531-539 West 25th Street, (212) 366-5757 (Tuesday through Sept. 13). This skillful Russian draftsman has a heavy-handed way with popular and political symbols. He draws giant parodies of "I Love N.Y." or "I Love Sex" bumper stickers, replacing the valentine heart with anatomically accurate skulls. Also on view is a double portrait of Lenin and Stalin. What's most interesting is not the imagery but how these enormous drawings are made: entirely with a blue ballpoint pen (Johnson).

"SPLIT," Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646) 336-7183 (through Sept. 6). The best thing in this six-person show is Xavier Veilhan's bigger-than-life skeleton woven in wicker; it slouches casually in a corner of the gallery, a marvel of exotic faux-folk art. Note, too, a dense mix of cartoon characters and abstract patterning painted collaboratively in gouache by Christian Schumann and Gary Panter (Johnson).

"THIS IS LAGOS: YABIS NIGHT, MUSIC AND FELA," Skoto, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 352-8058 (through Sept. 13). If you crave a second fix of the charismatic Nigerian musician Fela Anikulapo-Kuti after seeing "Black President" at the New Museum, Skoto is the place to go. Much of this gallery's fine summer show is devoted to vivid pictures of Fela by the Nigerian photographer Femi Bankole Osunla, who was part of Fela's inner circle from the early 1970's to the musician's death from AIDS in 1997. This work is complemented by a handsome series of color images of Africa by the American photographer Howard T. Cash, two heads sculptured by Osaretin Ighile and an alterlike installation by the young American artist Sol Sax (Cotter).

"VACATION," Spike, 547 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4100 (through Sept. 20). Innocence and experience collide in the works of Norm Magnusson, who outlines juvenile, coloring-book-style images over gridded fields of pages from pointedly selected books. Jesus offering guidance to a little boy is drawn over pages from Bulfinch's "Mythology," for example, and paper-doll clothes over "Lolita." Also on view: Buck Henri's engaging photographs of exotic dancers, old cars, mannequins, small-town parades and other subjects; Alan Schmer's illustrative paintings of farm animals; and Melissa Stern's pedestal-size figurative sculptures that blend Surrealism and primitivism (Johnson).

Other Galleries

"MIRACLE IN THE SCRAP HEAP: THE SCULPTURE OF RICHARD STANKIEWICZ," AXA Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, (212) 554-4818 (through Sept. 25). Welded together from scrap metal, Mr. Stankiewicz's slyly figurative semi-abstract sculptures from the mid-1950's were early warning signs that Abstract Expressionism was losing traction, and more worldly subjects, materials and ideas were bubbling up all around. His ingeniously composed works lived up to titles like "Kabuki Dancer," "Urchin," "Marionette," "Middle-Aged Couple" and "Family Portrait" with the spine-tingling accuracy of unusually art-savvy cartoons. They expanded upon Cubism, rebuked the prevailing lugubriousness of postwar sculpture and predicted many aspects of Pop and Minimalism. But they were too respectful of tradition to withstand the double-barreled onslaught of those movements. Organized by the Addision Gallery of American Art at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., this thoughtful show is the first Stankiewicz retrospective in New York. His penchant for compositional complexity, cartoonish figuration and the calculated two-timing of the abstract and the representational seem unusually pertinent and full of possibility (Smith).

Last Chance

"ART CHANTRY: GREATEST HITS, VOL. 1," P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-24 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through Sunday). The argument against graphic design as an art form receives its latest drubbing in this revelatory survey, organized by Robert Nikas and presenting more than 300 posters and album covers by Mr. Chantry, the Seattle-based designer and art director. Dating from the late 1970's to the present, these works capture much of the vitality of that city's underground music and theater scene while defining a maverick sensibility whose inventive, low-tech production values and polymorphous recycling of images add a chapter of their own to the history of appropriation art. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2 for students and 62+ (Smith).

"CUBA ON THE VERGE: AN ISLAND IN TRANSITION," International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000 (through Sunday). Is it possible for anyone to photograph Cuba without some sort of romance creeping in? The concept behind this show of Cuban, Cuban-American and American photographers was to eschew "cliched images of vintage American cars and other remnants of a prerevolutionary era" and instead to "convey Cuba present," as the show's guest curator, Terry McCoy, writes in the catalog. But some of the photographs suggest that even as Cuba sinks deeper into poverty, ruin and prostitution, the romance of faded beauty and glamorous revolution won't go away. The most refreshing shots are those in which subjects confront the camera and the fantasy. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 62+ (Boxer).

* "DREAMING IN PICTURES: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF LEWIS CARROLL," International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000 (through Sunday). A photograph is at least as much a looking glass as it is a window. We see in it our own reflections and obsessions. A post-Freudian world has inevitably come to see C. L. Dodgson's photographs through the looking glass of his alter ego, Lewis Carroll. This provocative show tries to put Dodgson's pictures back in their context, to stress that we have lost touch with Victorian conventions, which Dodgson largely obeyed when he photographed little girls. Childhood to Victorians represented, as the show's curator puts it, an "alternate reality, a metaphysical state of preknowledge." Dodgson, he adds, "could pose his charges in adult roles, give them guns, daggers and exotic costumes, even portray them as odalisques and half-dressed waifs, because he and most of his audience believed so emphatically in their total insulation from the implications of such postures." These presentations do not so much underscore the latent sexuality of the child (as we post-Freudians would have it) as they do an obvious lack of it. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

TED FAIERS, "Paintings From the 1950's," Richard York, 21 East 65th Street, (212) 772-9155 (through today). Indian Space painting was a mid-20th-century American movement that mixed Cubist abstraction with American Indian-style patterns and pictographs. Faiers's exercises in that now dimly remembered style have at best an appealing jazziness and chromatic radiance. There is something ultimately silly, though, about the idea of the sophisticated urbanite getting in touch with his inner shaman (Johnson).

* "HALF AIR," Marianne Boesky, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9889 (through today). Everything in this fascinating reliquary of a show looks as if it were exhumed from some moldy basement. It includes enigmatic, semi-abstract symbolist paintings by Forrest Bess; mesmerizing, diagrammatic linear compositions by Genn Branca; videos of the performance artist Charlemagne Palestine whipping himself into Dionysian frenzies; snapshots documenting the demimonde of the performance artist Jack Smith; and scenes from a Wooster Group film featuring the seaside antics of cross-dressed nuns (Johnson).

* "RAINING ELEPHANTS," Little Cakes Little Gallery, 240 East Fourth Street, Apt. 1D, East Village, (212) 979-9736 (through Sunday). This new apartment gallery has opened with a delightful show of work by the Pennsylvania artist Ed Wilcox and the Virginia collective Dearraindrop. Mr. Wilcox, who is in a band, works with several mediums, including painting, collage, sculpture and copying machines, with which he conjurs finely wrought, hallucinatory cartoon images. Dearraindrop specializes in what might be called collages of collages, incrementally covering the walls of the gallery with patches of fabric, cut paper, photographs, record album covers and paint. There is a library's worth of free-associational material here. Best of all, though, is Dearraindrop's rapid-fire, eye-tickling video, a time capsule of pop culture put through a shredder. The gallery is open Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 7 p.m. (Cotter).

"SITE AND INSIGHT: AN ASSEMBLAGE OF ARTISTS," P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through Sunday). Agnes Gund, former president of the Museum of Modern Art, a major collector and a longtime supporter of the arts, is the curator of a generally bland show of works by 15 artists she has followed over the years. Highlights include Ellen Phelan's elegant, soft-
focus landscape paintings; gnarly junk assemblages by Bruce Conner and Arthur Simms; Peter Campus's hypnotic, semi-abstracted video landscapes; and Jim Hodges's enormous curtain made of hundreds of stitched-together fake flowers. Hours and admission: See above (Johnson).

"ANDY WARHOL: SCREEN TESTS," Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through Monday). From 1964 to 1966, Warhol shot 500 short, silent black-and-white films of artists, musicians, actors, writers, filmmakers, models, curators, celebrities and hangers-on at the Factory. The Modern has restored 277 of these screen tests, representing about 34 hours of watching time, and now 28 of the films are being shown continuously on six screens. The subjects include Baby Jane Holzer, Salvador Dali, James Rosenquist, Dennis Hopper, Cass Elliott and Susan Sontag, but they are of variable interest. By shooting the films at one speed and playing them more slowly, Warhol exposedthe mechanics of discomposure and charisma. Some people are fascinating as they lose charisma; others are not. It has nothing to do with handsomeness, histrionics, coolness, slimness, trying or giving up. The typology of charisma is as elusive as the typology of criminality. Hours and admission: See above (Boxer).

HEADLINE: North Korea Says It May Test an A-Bomb 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN with DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Friday, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
North Korea told diplomats from five other nations on Thursday that it planned to declare formally that it has become a nuclear power and may test an atomic bomb in the near future to prove it, according to senior Bush administration officials.
 The statement by Kim Yong Il, North Korea's deputy foreign minister, appeared to sharply contradict the spirit of the six-party talks organized by China, North Korea's closest ally and leading aid donor, and may buttress the contention of hard-liners in the Bush administration that the reclusive Communist government has no intention of reaching a verifiable agreement to dismantle its nuclear program. 
 Even so, China prodded the United States, North Korea, South Korea, Russia and Japan, the participants in the talks that concluded here this afternoon, to agree to another round within two months, China's state media said.
Though there was no firm date set for future talks, the parties involved had said that they would consider an agreement to continue a dialogue a significant step, given the often volatile relations between North Korea and the United States. 
Asian diplomats described Thursday's meeting in less negative terms than did American officials, who revealed some details of the Beijing meetings to reporters in Washington on Thursday. These diplomats said the meeting was all along intended as a forum for parties to present negotiating positions, not to fully resolve differences.
North Korea has often made bellicose statements at negotiating sessions. In April, in its last meeting with the United States, a North Korean diplomat told James A. Kelly, then and now the head of the American negotiating team, that it had nuclear weapons and was moving quickly to develop more by extracting plutonium from spent nuclear fuel rods.
Administration officials cautioned that they had not yet seen a word-by-word translation of what the North Koreans said on Thursday, so they could not assess how much it went beyond the threats the North has issued in the past.
"Maybe they are bluffing, but if so, it raises the bluff to a new level," a senior official in Washington said.
The officials also said the statement by North Korea was perplexing because it is risky to publicize a nuclear test in advance, given the real chance that the test might fail.
In public, the White House insisted that it was unfazed by the North's action, calling it yet another effort by to increase pressure on President Bush through bluster and threats.
"North Korea has a long history of making inflammatory comments that serve to isolate it from the rest of the world," said Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman, speaking in Crawford, Tex. She said Mr. Bush had not backed away from his commitment that the United States would never tolerate a nuclear North.
Administration officials have not said how they would react to a nuclear test, which would show that North Korea has the ability to turn its nuclear technology into working weapons -- a step one intelligence analyst said recently was "something the North Koreans themselves probably aren't sure they can do."
But if North Korea follows through on its threat and conducts a nuclear explosion, that would almost certainly produce a serious escalation of the crisis and result in a breakdown of the current diplomatic overture.
A nuclear test could prompt the United States to seek a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning North Korea, opening the door to sanctions. North Korean officials have said they would consider sanctions an act of war.
Mr. Kim's comments came on the second day of discussions here at Diaoyutai state guest house, where representatives of the six nations were asked by China to respond to proposals put forward by other parties on Wednesday.
Mr. Kim, apparently responding to Mr. Kelly's rejection of the North's proposal to sign a nonaggression pact before it admits nuclear inspectors and scraps its nuclear program, accused the United States of refusing to abandon its hostile policy toward his country. 
Mr. Kim then said that the North intended to declare formally that it has nuclear weapons, and the ability to deliver them, and that it plans to test them, according to officials in Washington who were briefed on the talks by Mr. Kelly.
When negotiators from Russia and Japan sought to look for common ground between American and North Korean positions, Mr. Kim accused diplomats from those two countries of lying on instructions from the United States, according to Bush administration officials.
Some Bush administration officials have been saying for months that North Korea appears set on becoming a nuclear power and that a tight regime of sanctions and multilateral pressure, or even military action, may be necessary to prevent that from happening. But American officials had also supported the current talks because they view the discussions as a chance to put collective pressure on the North.
China, South Korea and Russia worked throughout the talks to balance American demands for a complete and verifiable end to North Korea's nuclear program with the North's call for a nonaggression treaty with Washington and for economic aid for its strapped economy.
A Chinese foreign policy expert informed about China's strategy at the talks said Beijing proposed a four-point declaration stating that all sides agree that the Korean peninsula should remain nuclear free, that the issue must be resolved peacefully, that North Korea's security concerns must be addressed, and that talks should be continued in the near future, he said.
The final statement appeared to fall short of that goal, with the various sides saying that they had a frank exchange of views and would continue to discuss the problem.

HEADLINE: Kerry Advocates Repealing Some Tax Cuts 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.H., Aug. 28 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts called today for rolling back some of President Bush's tax cuts to finance programs to reduce state taxes and encourage job creation.
 In a clear reference to his rival Howard Dean, Mr. Kerry said Democrats who were pressing to repeal all the tax cuts were peddling "rejected, old-style policies" that would cost middle-class families thousands of dollars a year. 
 Mr. Kerry said some Democrats "are so angry at George Bush and his unfair tax cuts" that they would repeal them entirely, adding $2,000 to the tax burden of a family offour -- "the hard-working, middle-class Americans who have borne the brunt of the Bush bust." 
Dr. Dean and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri are the only Democratic candidates who advocate completely undoing the Bush tax cuts. Mr. Kerry said they should be repealed only for people making more than $200,000 a year.
Mr. Kerry's speech at the University of New Hampshire, in which he spelled out his economic plan, came midway through a weeklong publicity push that is to culminate next week in a two-day announcement tour in which his advisers hope to seize the momentum from Dr. Dean.
A spokeswoman for Dr. Dean, Tricia Enright, responded by saying that "politicians in Washington" -- including senators, presumably -- had driven the country into debt "during both Bush recessions," while Dr. Dean was "balancing budgets" as governor of Vermont. "Some may say that's old-style politics," she added. "Howard Dean calls it old-fashioned common sense."
Mr. Gephardt said in a statement that his health care plan would give middle-class families $2,000 or more. "The challenges in front of our country require bold, ambitious solutions, not timid proposals that simply nibble around the edges," he said.
In his speech, Mr. Kerry called for tens of billions of dollars in new federal aid to states, college students and companies that hire more workers. He said the federal government was overspending at a rate of $1 billion a day, and vowed to restore pay-as-you-go fiscal discipline to Washington and cut the budget deficit in half in four years.
"When it comes to creating opportunity, restoring fiscal discipline, and putting values back into our economy, and preparing for the jobs of the future, George Bush has not lifted a finger," Mr. Kerry said. "I intend to move mountains."
Missing from Mr. Kerry's plan was the "tax holiday" he had been promoting as recently as June, which would have given workers an exemption from payroll tax on the first $10,000 of income. His advisers said the passage of the president's tax package had made it more sensible to modify the Bush tax cut as an economic stimulus.
Mr. Kerry said his partial repeal of the Bush tax cuts, along with cost-cutting measures like reducing the number of political appointees and eliminating their bonuses, would save $40 million. He proposed using $25 billion of that in his first two years as a bailout to cash-strapped states that would otherwise have to raise taxes or cut spending.
Calling Mr. Bush the "job-loss president," Mr. Kerry said Americans were being put out of work at a rate of more than two a minute. He called for a new incentive to manufacturers to expand in the United States, offering to refund the first two years of payroll taxes paid on any new employees. And he said he would expand the federal Hope scholarship to provide a tax credit of up to $2,500 a year for all four years of college tuition.
Some of what Mr. Kerry proposed today was a repackaging of legislation he and others in Congress have supported for years, like a tax incentive for manufacturers that expand their domestic production rather than move jobs overseas.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 30, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about a call by Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, to repeal some of President Bush's tax cuts misstated the amount he said would be saved by the rollback and other suggested cost-saving measures. It is $40 billion, not $40 million.

HEADLINE: Recall Candidates Court Central Valley Moderates 

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: FRESNO, Calif., Aug. 28 

 BODY:
Several thousand fans came to downtown Fresno this afternoon to see Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor-turned-recall-candidate-for-governor, who came courting moderates in the heart of California's Central Valley.
 Flanked by Alan Autry, the Republican mayor and former actor who portrayed Bubba in the CBS series "In the Heat of the Night," Mr. Schwarzenegger appealed for the support of the throng standing in the sweltering heat. 
 "Let me tell you, even though in the movies, you know, we are the superhero that takes care of everything," he said, "in real life it's different. I need your help." 
He made his appearance on a day in which Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, a Democrat and his main rival, called for amending the state's Constitution to bring large oil companies under state regulatory control and as a Latino civil rights organization called on Mr. Schwarzenegger to resign from the board of U.S. English, an organization committed to making English the country's official language.
Mr. Schwarzenegger, as is becoming his custom at his carefully controlled appearances on the campaign trail, took few questions, leaving details to aides.
Asked about U.S. English, Rob Stuzman, Mr. Schwarzenegger's spokesman, said the candidate "hasn't been active on that board for years."
"Once he becomes governor," Mr. Stuzman said, "he'll cut back on all board activities."
After touring a juice factory, Mr. Schwarzenegger did face questions from reporters about an interview he gave with a men's magazine in 1977 when he was 29 years old and a body builder. 
In the article in Oui magazine, which has appeared on the Smoking Gun Web site, he spoke of participating in group sex, said he had used "grass and hash" and talked about other aspects of his sex life.
"I'm not here to talk about that," he said today. "I'm here to push my economic agenda. I'm here to listen to the people."
He said, "I have no memory of any of the articles I did 20 or 30 years ago."
On Wednesday night, asked about the article on a radio show, Mr. Schwarzenegger said, "I never lived my life to be a politician," and added, "Obviously I made statements that are ludicrous and crazy and outrageous and all those things, because that is the way I was."
Other leading contenders in the election to recall Gov. Gray Davis also campaigned today. Peter Uberroth, a former baseball commissioner, told a town hall meeting in San Diego that he would convene a special session of the Legislature on his first day in office to deal with the state's budgetproblems.
State Senator Tom McClintock, also in San Diego, acted as the guest host of a radio station.
Mr. Schwarzenegger's day in Fresno had a touch of political swagger. Mr. Bustamante grew up in this agricultural community about a three-hour drive southeast of San Francisco. Mr. Bustamante is the first Latino to hold statewide office in more than 100 years and is Fresno's hometown hero.
Strategists within the Schwarzenegger camp say the Central Valley will loom large in their plans. They believe that Mr. Schwarzenegger must win 60 percent of its votes to offset the liberal urban cores of San Francisco and Los Angeles.
Mr. Schwarzenegger began his day at the Edison-Bethune Charter Academy, where he told a student assembly why he should be elected governor, if the voters decide to remove Governor Davis, on Oct. 7.
"Now of course I'm running for governor of this state," he told the children, making light of his sparse political bona fides. "Now talk about homework, that is some serious homework, let me tell you."
While Mr. Schwarzenegger was popular with the children and the crowd, his past support of a 1994 ballot measure, later struck down by the courts, that would have restricted public services for illegal immigrants may be a hard sell in the Central Valley, home to many people of Hispanic descent.
Outside the school, Jose Pacheco, a farm worker, said he would vote no on removing Mr. Davis and yes on installing Mr. Bustamante should the governor be removed and said he considered Mr. Schwarzenegger anti-Latino.

HEADLINE: Consulting Firm Confronts Its Own Problems 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

 BODY:
"Physician, heal thyself" is the maxim these days at A.T. Kearney, one of the oldest names in management consulting. 
 After resisting efforts over the last three years by the parent company, Electronic Data Systems, to incorporate the Kearney partnership wholesale into the E.D.S. corporate structure, top Kearney consultants are celebrating victory. 
 The new chief executive of E.D.S., Michael H. Jordan, has restored their autonomy, bonuses and other perks, and scotched market rumors that he would spin off the consulting arm to raise badly needed cash.
 Now, Kearney partners must rethink their company's business strategy from top to bottom. Their chief executive, Dietmar Ostermann, is moving Kearney to New York from the E.D.S. headquarters in Plano, Tex., and promises to increase the firm's share of the growing market for procurement outsourcing, or creating a system for regular purchases. 
 But with the global downturn cutting many consultants' revenues by a fifth or more since 2000, some say that Mr. Ostermann, an affable, 40-year-old native of Germany, will have his work cut out for him. Analysts warn that the infighting with E.D.S. and a subsequent wave of top-level resignations might have done irreparable damage to Kearney's image.
 According to Kennedy Information Inc., which tracks the consulting industry, Kearney's global revenues shrank to just over $1 billion last year from nearly $1.4 billion in 2000.
 Curing their own ills will be a formidable task for Kearney's strategists.
 "Our industry has taken a major hit over the past two years," Mr. Ostermann said last week in an interview while visiting Sao Paulo, Brazil. "This year, hopefully, things will flatten out, but we don't expect any growth in the global management business for the next three years."
 Not even China, where the consulting market is growing 20 percent a year, can compensate for the slump in North America, Europe and Japan, Mr. Ostermann said.
 Despite economic growth projections of 2.5 percent this year, he said, America is still in "a C.E.O.-led recession," with executives "focusing on cost-cutting, being very conservative with investments and making no bold moves."
 Nobody, however, could accuse Mr. Jordan of E.D.S. of shying from bold moves. When he took over in March, relations between parent and subsidiary were at their lowest point since E.D.S. acquired Kearney in 1995. Many analysts were predicting that the consulting business would quickly be spun off, possibly to Kearney's own partners, to help shore up the ailing finances of E.D.S.
 Instead, Mr. Jordan, 67, who spent 10 years as a consultant at McKinsey before winning Wall Street fame for rescuing Westinghouse in the 1990's, restored Kearney's autonomy, though E.D.S. will still nominate five of the nine members on a newly constituted board.
 For three years, Mr. Jordan's predecessor, Richard H. Brown, tried to clip Kearney's wings, cutting partners' bonuses, downsizing some offices and shifting Mr. Ostermann to Plano from Chicago, where Andrew Kearney first spun off his business from McKinsey in 1937.
 But what most riled Kearney partners were Mr. Brown's attempts to make them push E.D.S. products to their elite clientele. He once famously called the consulting business the Trojan horse of E.D.S. 
 "That was a complete error," Mr. Ostermann said. "If we ever did that, we'd be out of business in a hurry."
 The clash highlighted the abyss between the two organizations' management philosophies: E.D.S. is a top-down corporation where the chief executive issues orders, while Kearney is a partnership where ideas filter up from the bottom.
 The rift became even more evident last year when E.D.S. sued Frederick Steingraber, who had run Kearney for 18 years before Mr. Ostermann. The suit accused him of putting $100,000 worth of personal expenses -- including a 50th-birthday party for his wife and a laptop for his son -- on the company tab.
 Mr. Steingraber responded by accusing Mr. Brown of inflating profits and revenue to lift E.D.S.'s ailing stock price.
 "From the day they did the deal, there was an immediate cultural clash," said Jack Sweeney, editor in chief at Consulting Magazine in New York. He said Mr. Jordan had made "a very necessary move, if he wants to preserve the A.T. Kearney brand in the high-value consulting market."
 That, essentially, is the challenge Kearney faces as the consulting market consolidates.
 I.B.M. recently swallowed up PricewaterhouseCoopers's consulting arm and is now said to have an eye on the Boston Consulting Group and Bain, which are more elite and more like Kearney. 
 Kearney may have won back some independence, "but this is only a separation, not a divorce," said Tom Rodenhauser, an analyst at Consulting Information Services. "They're still in a bad marriage, stuck together for better, for worse."
 "At the end of the day," he said, "in the client's mind, there's always the question, 'When does the E.D.S. piece come into play?"'
 While insisting that "the integration question is off the table once and for all," Mr. Ostermann acknowledged that Kearney and E.D.S. must still figure out when and how to work together in the market.
 "And that is far from being a no-brainer," he said. 
 A recent five-year information technology services contract E.D.S. and Kearney signed with Altria could point the way toward recovery, Mr. Ostermann said, claiming that it will mean "millions of dollars for E.D.S., millions of dollars for A.T. Kearney and huge benefits for Altria."
 Another positive sign, he said, is that 7 of the 30 partners who left over the last three years have come back or are negotiating their return.
 Once the move to New York is completed, he said, he will focus on winning more contracts for procurement outsourcing, a sector that already represents 30 percent of the company's revenue and is growing by 15 percent a year.
 If all goes well, Mr. Ostermann should be able to convince the Kearney rank and file that he is the best man to run the company. Their independence restored, Kearney consultants will vote on whether Mr. Ostermann, previously seen as Mr. Brown's man, will stay on once his term runs out in December.

HEADLINE: A Different Standard of Living 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: PUNTA CANA, Dominican Republic 

 BODY:
The Dominican authorities spent tens of millions of dollars on new stadiums and pavilions for the recent Pan American Games, but when they needed bomb-sniffing dogs to protect visiting athletes and spectators, they had to borrow them from the international airport here. 
 Their request hardly surprised Frank Rainieri, because he and his partners in Grupo Punta Cana have spent 35 years investing in services, basic or otherwise, that usually are the government's responsibility. 
 The company also owns the airport -- the Caribbean's third busiest, with some 1.2 million arrivals last year -- along with the roads, power plant, water treatment facilities, schools and worker housing that surround it. By providing what the government says it cannot afford to offer, and tempered with a sense of corporate responsibility often unheard of in Latin America, Grupo Punta Cana has been the prime mover in turning a once-forbidding stretch of coastal jungle into a tourist resort that is responsible for a quarter of the country's gross domestic product.
 The government justified what many criticized as unnecessarily lavish spending on the games by saying the event would spur tourism. Yet the government pleaded poverty, Mr. Rainieri said, when local hoteliers proposed a $25 million "tourist boulevard" that would connect the eastern region's resorts, attract new businesses and result in $144 million in additional tourist spending, not to mention increased tax revenue. 
 "The government should be aware that this is one of the most important centers for the country," he said. "The state cannot flee its responsibilities, even less when we pay our taxes. The problem is, tourists don't vote."
 The government's inattention to the region unexpectedly helped spur the group's success. In the late 1960's, when land was inexpensive and inaccessible, a group of American labor lawyers and union officials, including the mediator Theodore W. Kheel, pooled $200,000 and bought a 30-square-mile stretch of jungle.
 The resort that now has 400 hotel rooms, luxury homes and a golf course began with 10 two-bedroom beachfront cabins. A deal with Club Med led to the realization that an airport was needed to bring in European tourists. The original airstrip needed upgrading, but the government was in no position to finance it.
 "If you build a hotel in New York City, you connect to Con Ed, the city water supply, the sewers," Mr. Kheel said. "We had nothing there. We had to create the entire infrastructure."
 Mr. Kheel and his partners joined with Club Med to build the airport, which openedin 1983 as the world's first privately owned and operated international airport.
 Today, a second terminal is rising next to the original thatch-roofed structure, and a second runway is planned for next year.
 Twenty years since the first charters arrived, the airport is now the group's moneymaker, bringing in more than $20 million a year in passenger fees, while refueling, catering and other services increase profit even more. 
 That success has financed innovative programs, including a 28-classroom trilingual school open to the children of executives and laborers alike, an environmental foundation devoted to sustainable development and scientific research with American universities, health education on H.I.V./AIDS awareness and plans for 1,000 two-bedroom houses for employees.
 The group's involvement puts it among a handful of companies willing to assume the kind of corporate responsibility more often found in companies in the United States.
 For example, not only was it the first company to sign an agreement with the presidential AIDS commission to educate its workers, it also committed $250,000 for that task and to help provide resources to a local public clinic that is now almost always closed."Most companies don't give anything, and that is the mentality of the country," said Paola Rainieri de Diaz, director of public relations and the founder's daughter. "They only want to pull for their side. That is why Latin America always winds up with populists like Hugo Chavez" -- the Venezuelan president -- "because we only want to take everything out of the community. The biggest want to squeeze and keep everything."
 The company's efforts have made a difference to workers and their children. Many said Grupo Punta Cana encouraged them to take courses in computers and English to become more competitive in a company that requires all employees to be literate to receive promotions.
Gerardo Garcia, chief butcher at the hotel, remembers when the only thing he cut was the thick vegetation. When he arrived 34 years ago, it was a five-hour drive along the beach to the nearest town, Higuey. He stayed and prospered, in his own way, with three of his children enrolled in the new school. Some of his neighbors said the company even paid for their children to go to college.
 "This is the best thing in the Dominican Republic, not just for me but for thousands of people," Mr. Garcia said. "Mr. Rainieri is grateful to his employees. He remembers his people."
 Mr. Rainieri, who studied agriculture at Texas A&M University before a family friend recommended him to Mr. Kheel, said he was motivated by a blend of family commitment and common-sense business. If tourism depends on a welcoming staff, then the staff must also be happy.
 "We businesspeople need to respond to their needs in health, education and housing," he said. "The bad thing is the Dominican state does not recognize that. They do not offer incentives."
 For example, the company is about to break ground on the first 80 houses for workers, to be financed through a $1 million revolving loan fund. The plan is to build 1,000 houses that workers will own through payroll deductions that decrease over 20 years.
 Workers, many of whom have lived in run-down houses, would also have access to a social worker who will help them adapt, he said. But construction has yet to start as company lawyers try to find their way through a thicket of laws and zoning rules.
 He has had better luck providing interest-free college loans to children of employees, who then return to work in office jobs and repay their loans so others can go to school.
 "I believe in sustainable development in everything," he said. "The idea is not to give. I am against all the gift giving in Latin America. Paternalism has become the most dangerous thing, where the politicians only give so they can attract adherents."
 In a part of the country where unemployment is rock-bottom and the private sector takes up much of the government's duties, executives said there is little political incentive for the government to face its responsibilities.
 Instead, when President Hipolito Mejia attended the inauguration of a commercial strip at Punta Cana, he jokingly accused Mr. Rainieri of not paying taxes. The presidential crack made the news, but not Mr. Rainieri's retort.
 "Excuse me, but we pay millions in taxes and not one cent is invested here," he said. "The ones who do not pay taxes are your friends. Here, political friendships are the source of privilege."
 Those cozy relationships have lasted through various governments, he said, and have held back the country, which faces a mammoth $2.2 billion bank fraud that financed a host of insider businesses. Add to that, he said, the failure of privatization in many Latin American countries, where a favored few reaped fortunes while services declined.
 That is why he is proposing that if the government ever agrees to build the tourist boulevard, an oversight commission be established with members from the government, the private sector and the church.
 "You need transparency so capital will endure," he said. "Nobody talks about communism anymore. Now it is corruption that is the biggest enemy."

HEADLINE: China at Korea Talks: Taking DiplomacyUpstage 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
Even though the six nations that gathered for talks here this week have yet to agree on how to stop North Korea's nuclear program, at least one breakthrough was evident: the emergence of China as a more assertive diplomatic power.
 China cajoled and badgered the United States, North Korea, South Korea, Japan and Russia to join negotiations on how to resolve the Korea arms crisis. It succeeded in pressing participants to commit to another round, despite obvious tensions between the United States and North Korea. 
 Such initiatives are oddly foreign to China. Although it has the world's largest population and fastest-growing economy, it has generally abstained or carped from the sidelines on the most pressing issues of the day, most recently the war in Iraq. For more than a decade, it dismissed American-North Korean tensions as a relic of the cold war that the two nations should resolve on their own. 
Beijing's decision to broker the nuclear talks reflects alarm in the top ranks of the Communist Party that the North Korean problem could spiral out of control, with both the North and the United States locked in polar positions. Experts said China had decided that it was uniquely positioned to make a difference because of longstanding ties with North Korea, a neighbor and onetime political and military ally, and its improving relationship with the Bush administration.
Yet its assertiveness may also reflect a new sense of engagement with the world that offers some parallels to the emergence of the United States as a dominant power nearly a century ago, experts say. 
"China is starting to act like a big power, with interests it has to defend even outside its borders," said Yan Xuetong, a influential foreign policy expert at Qinghua University in Beijing. "I expect these talks to be remembered as an important milestone in history for that reason."
The North Korea talks are China's highest-profile role to date, but Beijing has begun to extend its reach in other areas as well.
In the spring, China persuaded Southeast Asian nations to create a free trade zone between China and the region, modeled on the North American Free Trade Agreement. Beijing has also begun using its huge foreign currency reserves, totaling more than $320 billion, to extend development loans to poorer countries, including a recent $150 million loan package for Vietnam, a former adversary, and $400 million for cash-strapped Indonesia.
China could take a leading role in the Korea talks also because it had taken steps to improve its relationship with the United States since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. China offered America help in suppressing terrorism in Central Asia, a longstanding Chinese concern because it controls the restive Muslim region of Xinjiang. The Bush administration dropped its early focus on China as a potential adversary as it became engaged in fighting terrorism globally.
Regionally, a fragile alliance that China forged with Russia and four Central Asian nations appears to have achieved some momentum. The group, known as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, after the Chinese city where it was founded, conducted its first joint military exercises this summer to practice combating terrorist strikes.
"China's new leadership has clearly shown its desire to play a bigger role in the world," said Chung Chong Wook, a former South Korean national security adviser who helped manage an earlier round of negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program. "You get the sense that they are far more confident than they were before."
It is unlikely, of course, that China could or would want to try to match American influence worldwide. It does not have a mobile military that could project forces far beyond its borders, and its core interests are still regional and territorial, including the question of Taiwan.
Beijing is still recovering from the embarrassment it caused itself by its initial mismanagement of the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Its coverup of the sometimes fatal disease in its early stages highlighted the fact that China's political system is still closed and reflexively wary of the outside world.
Still, the North Korea crisis may have brought an end to China's complacent foreign policy. Chinese experts say Beijing began accepting in the spring American intelligence that the North had already developed one or two atomic bombs. Chinese officials also worried that the Bush administration, emboldened by a military victory in Iraq, was weighing the use of force on the Korean peninsula, where China fought a war 50 years ago.
"The situation became an urgent crisis that the top leadership decided to handle personally," said Shi Yinhong, a foreign policy expert at People's University in Beijing.

HEADLINE: City Opera Faces Possible Strike 

 BODY:
The members of the theatrical wardrobe workers' union, Local 764, voted on Wednesday night to authorize a strike against the New York City Opera two weeks before the scheduled beginning of its fall season.
 The vote, at the union's headquarters on West 45th Street, means that the union could strike at any time, though both sides said yesterday that talks were continuing. 
The union's contract expired in November. 
 Patricia White, the president of the local, said City Opera's last offer was a four-year contract with wage increases of 1.5 to 2.5 percent each year, increases Ms. White said were less than the projected rate of inflation. 
Wardrobe workers at the opera generally make $23 to $25 an hour, said Bruce Cohen, a spokesman for the union; the expired contract also guaranteed 20 weeks of work a year, though the average wardrobe worker works 30 weeks.
Susan Woelzl, the director of press and public relations for the opera, would not comment on the vote except to say that talks were continuing. 
Handel's "Alcina" is scheduled to open the season on Sept. 9.

HEADLINE: Canadian Economy Posts Decline in Quarter 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON

DATELINE: TORONTO, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
After several years as the star performer in the industrial world, the Canadian economy went into reverse in the second quarter, weighed down by a sharp appreciation of the Canadian dollar, as well as by outbreaks of SARS in Toronto and mad cow disease in Alberta.
 Statistics Canada said today that gross domestic product shrank by an annual rate of 0.3 percent, adjusted for inflation, in contrast to growth of 2.6 percent in the first three months of the year. The American economy, which has lagged Canada's for most of the last five years, grew at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the second quarter. 
 Economists are divided on whether the second-quarter setback will lead the Bank of Canada to cut short-term interest rates again at its next review of monetary policy on Wednesday. The bank pared its benchmark overnight rate in mid-July by a quarter percentage point to 3 percent, reversing more than a year of steady increases.
George Vasic, chief economist at UBS Securities Canada in Toronto, described the second-quarter setback as "a pause of no concern." Citing the rebounding American economy, a recovery in the car and housing markets in June and July as well as a pullback in the Canadian dollar, Mr. Vasic said that a further drop in interest rates was not necessary to stimulate the economy.
Still, 10 out of 12 economists surveyed by the CD Howe Institute, a research group, said that the central bank should cut rates next week.
Edward Carmichael, chief economist at J. P. Morgan Securities Canada, wrote to clients today that the latest numbers, as well as an unexpected drop in inflation in July, had "cemented the case" for a drop of a quarter percentage point in the Bank of Canada's rate. After that, he wrote, "the bank is likely to remain on hold until the United States recovery prompts renewed central bank tightening next year."
The Canadian dollar gained almost two-thirds of an American cent today, trading at 72.20 cents in mid-afternoon before closing at 72.13 cents.
Mr. Carmichael said that he expected Canada's growth rate to be roughly 2 percent in the third quarter, partly because of the power blackout this month that affected sections of the Northeastern United States and Ontario. 
For a week after the blackout, Canadian businesses were asked to cut their power consumption by 50 percent, and about 150,000 federal and provincial government workers stayed home.
The SARS outbreak, which claimed 44 lives in Toronto, has discouraged tourism in Canada, while the discovery of a single case of mad cow disease halted almost all beef exports for more than two months. The United States has partly lifted its ban on Canadian beef products.
Statistics Canada said that the second-quarter slump was caused partly by a slowdown in inventory building by retailers and wholesalers. In addition, manufacturing output shrank for the third consecutive quarter, mainly because of lower shipments to the United States, which buys about 85 percent of Canada's exports. These setbacks were partly offset by increases in consumer spending and business investment, especially in housing.

HEADLINE: J. P. Morgan Selected to Run New Trade Bank in Iraq 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
J. P. Morgan Chase has been selected to operate a bank the United States is creating in Iraq to manage billions of dollars to finance imports and exports.
 J. P. Morgan will lead a group that includes 13 banks representing 13 countries to run the bank for three years, said Peter McPherson, the top United States economic adviser in Iraq. 
 Operating the bank, the Trade Bank of Iraq, will give banks access to the financial system of Iraq, which has huge oil reserves; foreign bank companies have not operated in the country since a policy of nationalization in the 1950's and 1960's. Yesterday's announcement came on the day a car bomb killed a top Iraqi cleric and at least 82 others, underscoring the danger of having a presence in the country. 
The trade bank will serve as an intermediary for Iraqi government agencies' purchases of equipment and supplies from companies based outside the country, Mr. McPherson told reporters in Washington in a conference call from Baghdad.
As private enterprise becomes more important, Iraqi companies will also use the bank to support trade.
An Iraqi, most likely from a government ministry, will be selected to run the bank. "We expect an Iraqi to be the chief executive officer and most of the employees will be Iraqi," Mr. McPherson said. J. P. Morgan will train bank employees.
The trade bank will start with $5 million in cash and a $95 million line of credit from a fund controlling Iraqi oil revenue operated under the auspices of the United Nations, Mr. McPherson said. Final details of the contract are being negotiated, with a signing anticipated in September.
A total of 58 banks expressed interest for a contract that will yield "a very few million dollars" in fees to the winning consortium, Mr. McPherson said. The J. P. Morgan group was chosen because it was judged to be able to run a "high- quality, cost-efficient" operation, he added.
"We are pleased that the Coalition Provisional Authority has selected the J. P. Morgan consortium to help establish and operate the trade bank in Iraq," said Joseph Evangelisti, a J. P. Morgan spokesman. "This is a critically important assignment."
Along with J. P. Morgan, other members of the winning bank group are the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Standard Chartered, National Bank of Kuwait, Bank Millennium, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, San Paolo IMI, Royal Bank of Canada, Credit Lyonnais, Caja de Ahorros y Pensiones de Barcelona, Standard Bank Group, Akbank TAS and Banco Comercial Portugues.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Nasdaq and Big Board Shares Advance in Light Trading

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Technology stocks achieved their seventh consecutive monthly advance and blue chip stocks posted a sixth consecutive month of gains yesterday in an otherwise unremarkable pre-Labor Day session. Trading was extremely light.
 After fluctuating early, by afternoon the market achieved moderate gains. The atmosphere was dull despite encouraging reports on consumer spending and the manufacturing sector. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 41.61 points, or 0.4 percent, at 9,415.82. For the week, the Dow gained 0.7 percent.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 10.27 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,810.45. The Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced 5.17, or 0.5 percent, to 1,008.01. For the week, the Nasdaq climbed 2.6 percent and the S.& P. gained 1.5 percent.
While trading was slow throughout August as traders were away on summer vacations, the major indexes easily ended the month higher. It was the fourth straight winning week for the Dow and the third for the Nasdaq, S.& P. and Russell 200 index.
Analysts were encouraged that Wall Street was able to advance again, this time in the doldrums of August.
"This is potentially good news because if we now see the top of the range begin to act as support, we increase the chance of breaking out to the top side as traders return to the market," said Chris Johnson, manager of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati.
There was a lot of economic news yesterday, most of it positive.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,sought to reassure the market that the Fed aimed to guard against even a remote risk of deflation.
In a speech in Jackson, Wyo., Mr. Greenspan defended the Fed's recent worries about deflation, which caused some volatility on Wall Street. He said it was sometimes necessary for the Fed in its interest rate policy to take out an insurance policy "against the emergence of especially adverse outcomes."
Before the market opened, the Commerce Department reported consumers increased their spending 0.8 percent in July as the latest tax cut provided extra cash.
The increase in spending last month was the largest since March and followed a sizable 0.6 percent advance in June. July's spending figure matched economists' expectations. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the United States economy.
Goodyear Tire and Rubber rose 50 cents, to $7.12, after the company announced on Thursday that it would eliminate about 500 jobs at its North American tire operations as part of continuing cost-cutting measures.
Starbucks gained 75 cents, to $28.39, after reporting a 9 percent increase in same-store sales in August.
PeopleSoft rose 35 cents, to $18.05; the brokerage house Robert W. Baird upgraded it to outperform from neutral.
The last time the Dow had six or more straight monthly gains was an eight-month run from December 1994 through July 1995. The S.& P. last had a six-month rally from January through June 1996, and the last time the technology-dominated Nasdaq had a streak as long was the 10-month period that ran from December 1994 through September 1995.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading volume was light at 991.19 million shares, below the 1.17 billion of Thursday.
The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller-company stocks, rose 1.61, or 0.3 percent, at 497.42. The Russell had a weekly gain of 2.5 percent.

Treasury Prices Decline
By The Associated Press
Bond prices fell yesterday in quiet trading ahead of the Labor Day weekend. The bond market closed at 2 p.m.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 8/32, to a price of 98 13/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.45 percent from 4.42 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/32, to 102 13/32. The bond's yield was unchanged at 5.21 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS; 
July Spending By Consumers Shows a Rise

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Consumer spending rose in July at the fastest pace in four months and Chicago-area manufacturing expanded by the most in more than a year, adding to evidence the economy strengthened at the start of the third quarter.
 Spending rose 0.8 percent, to $7.7 trillion at an annual rate, after a revised 0.6 percent increase in June, the Commerce Department said yesterday. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago's factory index increased to 58.9 from 55.9 in July. Readings have exceeded 50, indicating expansion, since May. "We are seeing increased foot traffic in our stores," said Bob Sasser, president and chief operating officer of Dollar Tree Stores Inc. "Whenever the economy is better there are more people out shopping." 
Consumers may have the wherewithal to keep spending, aided by income tax cuts that helped increase disposable incomes by 1.5 percent, the most since January 2002. Of that increase, 1.3 percentage points was attributable to the tax cuts. Wages and salaries failed to increase, reflecting a weak job market.
The University of Michigan's August consumer sentiment index fell to 89.3 today from a preliminary 90.2 reading earlier this month. Still, the index is about 12 points higher than at the start of the Iraq war in March.
The United States economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate from April through June, the fastest since last year's third quarter, the Commerce Department said yesterday. Lehman Brothers raised its third-quarter growth forecast to 5 percent from 4 percent. The White House has forecast 3.7 percent growth for next year.
The Chicago-area manufacturing report's employment index increased to 51.2 from 46 in July, the first reading to show expansion in factory jobs since the 51 recorded in March 2000, a year before the last recession began. The area's manufacturers are increasing production to meet new orders amid increased consumer spending. A drop in the value of the dollar has made goods cheaper overseas, lifting demand.
Pretax incomes rose 0.2 percent in July, the Commerce Department reported. The gain in spending was led by increased sales of automobiles and other durable goods. 
Economists had expected a 0.8 percent increase in spending after a previously reported 0.3 percent gain in June, based on the median of 65 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. They had also expected incomes to rise 0.3 percent, matching the increase in each of the previous two months.
Purchases of durable goods like autos and furniture rose 2.1 percent in July after rising 1 percent in June, yesterday's report showed. Spending on nondurable goods rose 0.8 percent for a second month. Spending on services, which account for almost 60 percent of all outlays, increased 0.5 percent after rising 0.4 percent in June.
Figures released so far in August suggest that spending is maintaining momentum. Sales of cars and light trucks might reach an 18.2 million annual rate in August, after a 17.3 million pace in July, according to projections from J. D. Power & Associates.

HEADLINE: Angry Drivers Fill It Up, Up, Up; 
Get Used to It, Analysts Say; Surging Fuel Prices May Persist

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: TOPEKA, Kan., Aug. 27 

 BODY:
Seated in the cab of his 18-wheeler, a Peterbilt 379, W. C. Rich -- a man who crisscrosses the country hauling furniture -- pulls out a folder full of diesel fuel receipts at a rest stop here. 
 "Look here," he says, adjusting his glasses. "Back on Aug. 12, I paid $1.359 in Hermiston, Ore. This morning I paid $1.579. How am I going to make it with these prices?" 
 Mr. Rich, 61, owns and operates a trucking company and drives more than 100,000 miles a year. He quickly calculates the additional cost of filling his 100-gallon tank: about an extra $22 every time he fills up -- or an extra $150 a week. 
Dario Gamboa, a truck driver in California, is just as upset. So is Murtadha Alatishe, a taxi driver in Houston. Indeed, across the country, truckers, taxi drivers, travelers and others buying gasoline or diesel fuel ahead of the Labor Day weekend have been voicing similar concerns because fuel prices are at their highest level, before adjusting for inflation, since the Energy Department began tracking them in 1990.
Having risen in seven of the last eight weeks, the average retail price of gasoline this week shot up to $1.75 a gallon, 24 percent above a year ago, according to the Energy Department. Not since the mid-1980's has the price of gasoline been so high, though it is still well below the levels of the early 1980's, when prices peaked at the equivalent of $2.90 a gallon.
Energy experts blame a host of factors, including a July 30 pipeline rupture in Arizona; refinery problems on the East and West Coasts; and the power blackouts in the Northeast and Midwest that caused several refineries to shut temporarily.
Big oil-exporting countries have also tightened supplies in recent weeks, some analysts say, even as political turmoil has slowed exports from Nigeria, Venezuela and Iraq.
"You've had this confluence of events, the perfect situation to have an effect on global prices," said Chris Kelley, a spokesman at the American Petroleum Institute, which represents big oil companies.
Record demand for gasoline in the United States is also helping drive up prices. Travel experts say that many Americans who were unnerved by the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the war in Iraq have decided to travel by car this summer, and to stay closer to home.
"This is the strongest gas usage on record," said Justin McNaull, a spokesman for AAA, which estimates that 28 million people will travel by car this holiday weekend, the most in eight years. "We saw a cloudy, gloomy, rainy first half of the summer. But the weather cleared up and people realize this is the end of the summer."
Many, however, are venting their anger at pump prices. Just ask Cristin Cousins, a dentist in Denver who, with her husband, was filling up her Ford Escape on Tuesday evening, preparing for a 1,400-mile trip to Michigan for a Labor Day weekend wedding.
"I'm regretting our decision," Ms. Cousins said inside the gas station store. "Maybe we should have flown because driving isn't going to save us as much money as we thought."
People who drive for a living are taking it even worse.
On Tuesday, at a truck stop in Buttonwillow, Calif., just off Interstate 5, Milen Dimitrov, an independent trucker, was refilling his 100-gallon tanks, complaining about soaring prices and easily calculable losses.
"Let me give you a simple example," he said. "If I have to pay 40 cents more per gallon, that will be about $7,000 a year less for me."
A similar scene played out at another truck stop, this one in the San Joaquin Valley of California, where Dario Gamboa, who was trucking fresh produce to Boston, paid $161.97 to fill his refrigerated truck tank, about 30 percent more than he typically pays for diesel. "It's terrible," he said.
There are, of course, no uniform gas prices in the United States. On the East Coast, gas now costs about $1.69 a gallon, up about 32 cents from a year ago, according to a federal survey. In the Midwest, the price is close to $1.72.
But nowhere is gas more expensive than in beleaguered California, where amid a huge budget deficit and a pending gubernatorial recall the average price of gasoline has jumped to $2.10 a gallon.
The most expensive part of the state is one of the richest, Santa Barbara, where prices are near $2.21 a gallon. That is also the price in Laguna Beach, where Ken Carey, the owner of a Chevron station, has been watching his customers wince at the escalating prices.
"In the last two weeks it's been up 38 cents a gallon," Mr. Carey said. "It's incredible. People won't just run down to the grocery store to grab a quart of milk. They're going to wait till they need a few items. They do cut back. They really do."
In Texas and the Gulf Coast region, where oil derricks are almost as common as churches, prices are relatively reasonable, by comparison, averaging $1.60 a gallon.
But that doesn't mean people won't complain.
"I'm hoping for a break very soon," said Murtadha Alatishe, a cabdriver, as he filled up the tank of a Ford Crown Victoria at a station in Houston, where gas was priced at $1.59 a gallon. "My overhead is much higher and my take-home much lower."
Here in Kansas, where a severe drought this summer has wrecked most crops, higher fuel prices are translating into higher costs for powering the combines that are just moving into action.
A lucky few farmers, though, have invested in ethanol, the corn-based fuel additive that is pegged to gas prices. When gas prices soar, so does the price of ethanol.
"I hate to say it, but this is really good for us," said Ken McCauley, a farmer in eastern Kansas who has invested in the Golden Triangle ethanol plant, across the state border, in Craig, Mo. The plant produces 20 million gallons of ethanol a year. 
Part of the problem can be seen in gasoline inventories, which are the lowest in three years, according to Doug MacIntyre, a senior oil market analyst at the Energy Information Administration, a division of the Energy Department.
The spike in gas prices is basic economics, and that means the highest weekly prices recorded since the Energy Department survey began. "It's the highest price ever if you don't take into account inflation," Mr. MacIntyre said.
But what consumers really want to know is when they can expect relief.
Some energy analysts say the signs are not promising. Refineries are overtaxed and near capacity. And structural, regional and distribution problems persist in the industry.
Indeed, a study by the RAND Corporation, a research center in Santa Monica, Calif., found that the nation's refiners expect price volatility to continue for the next few years, and that some refiners even worry about their ability to handle the growing demand for gasoline. The Energy Information Administration estimates that that demand will grow 1 to 2 percent a year.
"There's not a lot of excess capacity out there," said D. J. Peterson, author of the RAND study. "This situation where you have temporary shutdowns in the Midwest, refinery glitches in California -- these things may continue to occur."

HEADLINE: Philosopher On the Trail Of Daniel Pearl's Killer 

BYLINE:  By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
Bernard-Henri Levy does nothing that goes unnoticed. He is an intellectual adventurer who brings publicity to unfashionable political causes. He is also a handsome man married to a glamorous actress; he and his wife, Arielle Dombasle, are regularly mentioned in French gossip magazines. Now 55, Mr. Levy is well used to celebrity. For 25 years he has been known here simply by his initials, B. H. L.
 Not that everyone takes him seriously. His carefully cultivated public persona, which includes black suits, unbuttoned white shirts and long, dark hair, is frequently mocked on a televised puppet show, and he is often hit with pies by a Belgian who claims to target the self-important. The satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine once asked of him, "Rimbaud or Rambo?" 
 Yet France has always had a place for high-profile intellectuals, from Victor Hugo and Emile Zola to Jean-Paul Sartre and Andre Malraux. And from an early age, Mr. Levy set off in their footsteps. He earned his spurs in the late 1970's as one of several "new philosophers" who enraged the left by attacking the Soviet Union. He then turned his guns on the right, warning that 1930's-style fascism was still rooted in French politics. 
Since then he has constantly been in the limelight. He has tried his hand at fiction, theater and movies (although his only feature film to date, "Day and Night," starring his wife, was a flop). And he has continued to campaign for what he considers noble causes, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, from Afghanistan to Bosnia. In a book published in 2001, for instance, he wrote of forgotten wars in Sudan, Angola, Burundi, Sri Lanka and Colombia.
What most annoys his critics, however, is that Mr. Levy is often the star of his own stories. And the complaint has been heard anew about his latest book, in which he sets out to solve the murder of Daniel Pearl, a correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, who was killed after his kidnapping in Pakistan on Jan. 23, 2002. Yet, conversely, if the book has sold more than 200,000 copies here since April, it is also because Mr. Levy's name and passion continue to draw French readers.
Now, with the publication next week of the English translation of "Who Killed Daniel Pearl?" (Melville House Publishing), Mr. Levy is entering unknown territory. Not only is his name less known in the United States than Mr. Pearl's, but the question also arises as to why a French intellectual should investigate the murder in a far-off land of a man who was an American, a journalist and a Jew.
"If I had to pick, I'd say it was because he was Jewish," said Mr. Levy, who is himself a nonpracticing Jew. "Amid my shock at his death was the realization that we were entering a century in which a man could have his throat cut for saying, 'My father is Jewish, my mother is Jewish, I am a Jew.' As I read his work, I also understood he was not just a Jew. He was a Jew who believed in reaching out to moderate Islam. And I recognized myself in his way of being Jewish."
But there was another reason, Mr. Levy explained in an interview in his comfortable Left Bank apartment. "I am hardly a fan of today's American government -- I opposed the Iraq war from the beginning -- but I am nonetheless strongly anti-anti-American," he said. "I am alarmed by the way anti-Americanism is becoming globalized. Through Danny Pearl's experience, I had the feeling that the idea of America as a magnet for the worst was becoming a global phenomenon."
Mr. Levy nonetheless tells the story as a narrative of his own investigation, something that irritated some French critics. "B. H. L. is an intellectual whose most accomplished work is the construction of his own biography," Pierre Assouline, editor of the literary monthly Lire, noted acidly. Others were more generous. In Le Monde, Alain Frachon said he found the book convincing. And, writing in Le Figaro, Jean de Belot praised it as "a splendid journey to better understand the fragility of the world."
Mr. Levy was on a diplomatic mission to Afghanistan for President Jacques Chirac when he heard of Mr. Pearl's death. After completing his work in Kabul, he flew immediately to Karachi, returning to Pakistan for the first time since 1971. And in his airport taxi, he already sensed how the country had changed. "What is your religion?" the taxi driver asked him. He was taken aback. "Atheist," he finally replied. "My religion is atheism."
He said he first imagined writing a long report for Le Monde, but was soon drawn into a more ambitious project, one that he felt equipped to carry out.
"I don't think any American newspaper would have taken the risk of sending a journalist -- especially a Jew -- in the steps of Daniel Pearl," he said. "I had the luck of being French, with the French position on the Iraq war well known. I still had a diplomatic passport. I played with ambiguities, telling people I was doing something I wasn't doing then: I was writing a novel, I was an official envoy. I was far less exposed than any American, although still at risk as a Jew."
He has assumed a different risk by writing what he calls a "romanquete," part roman, or novel, part enquete, or investigation. He mentions Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood" and Norman Mailer's "Oswald's Tale" as precedents, but he has raised eyebrows by imagining the thoughts of Mr. Pearl as he was about to have his throat cut and those of Ahmed Omar Sheikh, the British-born son of Pakistani immigrants who is the convicted mastermind of the murder.
Most of the book, though, is reported on the ground. Mr. Levy made five trips to Pakistan, two each to India, the United States and Britain, and one each to Bosnia and Dubai. And his conclusion is anything but fictional: that Pakistan's military secret service, the Inter-Services Intelligence, widely known as I.S.I., is deeply involved with both the Islamic fundamentalist groups responsible for Mr. Pearl's death and with Al Qaeda.
So why a romanquete?
"I am also a novelist, and I suppose that the book has a tone more of a writer than of a traditional researcher," said Mr. Levy, whose earlier book, "Sartre: The Philosopher of the 20th Century" (Polity Press), has also just been published in English. "But the real reason is that, by introducing elements of speculation, it was possible to move forward when the investigation seemed stuck. There are moments when I have the intuition of a novelist, moments that serve as sparks to illuminate and advance."
He cited his decision to spend a night at the Akbar International Hotel in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, where on Jan. 11, 2002, Mr. Pearl met Mr. Sheikh. Mr. Pearl had been told that Mr. Sheikh could put him in touch with Sheik Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani, a Muslim cleric reportedly linked to Richard C. Reid, a Briton accused of using a shoe bomb to try to sabotage an American airliner en route from Paris to Miami. In reality Mr. Sheikh was preparing the kidnapping 12 days later.
Mr. Levy said he had been fully briefed on the meeting by Mr. Pearl's assistant, Asif Faruqi, but his "novelist's instinct" told him to stay in the hotel. And what he observed, he said, led him to discover that the I.S.I. used the Akbar to house Kashmiri fighters and other Islamic radicals. In other words, he writes, Mr. Sheikh set up the meeting with Mr. Pearl in a hotel "controlled, almost managed, by the I.S.I." 
The bulk of Mr. Levy's investigation involved reading police and intelligence files and interviews. To help draw his admiring portrait of Mr. Pearl, for instance, he met the reporter's parents and widow, Mariane, who (unlike The Wall Street Journal) cooperated with him. (He has dedicated the book to Adam Pearl, the child that Mrs. Pearl was carrying at the time of her husband's death.)
In London Mr. Levy interviewed Mr. Sheikh's brother, former friends and some fellow students from his years at the London School of Economics. He also tracked Mr. Sheikh's steady radicalization: his identification with the plight of Bosnian Muslims, his move to Pakistan, his jailing in India on kidnapping charges, his release in exchange for a hijacked Indian plane and his ties to the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan.
In Pakistan to verify details obtained from police records, Mr. Levy visited the abandoned Karachi house where Mr. Pearl was killed. He met Pakistani officials who openly attacked the United States and, specifically, Jews. And with considerable trepidation, he paid an unannounced visit to the Sunni madrasa, or Islamic seminary, of Binori Town, where Mr. Sheikh is said to have slept some nights before the kidnapping.
More critically, as he advanced in his research, Mr. Levy came to view the official Pakistani version that Mr. Sheikh acted alone as a cover-up for a far darker reality, one that placed Mr. Sheikh at the heart of a complex network of Islamic fundamentalist groups, many linked to the I.S.I. and Al Qaeda.
Less clear, Mr. Levy admits, is why Mr. Pearl was killed. He nonetheless speculates that Mr. Pearl was pursuing evidence that Al Qaeda and North Korea were receiving nuclear secrets from Pakistani scientists with ties to the I.S.I. and fundamentalist groups. "In other words," Mr. Levy writes, "I bet on a Daniel Pearl busy gathering proof of Pakistan's collusion between the leading rogue states and terrorist networks of the world." 
Paul Steiger, managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, said the newspaper had no evidence that Mr. Pearl was investigating any such conspiracy. "The Wall Street Journal was not involved in any way in the preparation of this book," he said in a statement responding to the book. "However, we urge all the authorities involved in the investigation to review the book to see whether it provides any useful information which could help in the effort to bring Danny's killers to justice."
While Mr. Levy does not hesitate to proclaim Pakistan itself a rogue state, he chooses to end his book on a conciliatory note, evoking moderate Muslims he has known in Bosnia, Algeria, Morocco and Afghanistan. "There is this gentle Islam towards which, in spite of everything, until the last minute, Daniel Pearl wanted to believe, as I want to believe," he writes. And he adds, "It was the true subject of this book -- homage to my posthumous friend and a call for the sharing of light."

THE GREAT LAKES OF AFRICA
Two Thousand Years of History
By Jean-Pierre Chretien
Translated by Scott Straus
Zone Books, 503 pages. $36.
 In central Africa, a genocidal war has raged for nearly a decade, costing more than four million lives in Rwanda, Burundi and Congo and precipitating the worst humanitarian crisis in more than half a century. Central Africa shares this gruesome recent past with southeastern Europe, where in the 1990's the Balkans were swept by a wave of killing and "ethnic cleansing." In both cases, genocide was widely misunderstood to be the inevitable product of "ancient hatreds." 
 Jean-Pierre Chretien, a French historian with vast experience in the Great Lakes region of Africa, has undertaken the formidable task of tracing the roots of the region's violence and exposing the ideological myths on which the ancient-hatreds theory rests. In a monumental study that marches through two millenniums before approaching central Africa's contemporary agony, Mr. Chretien punctures the sense of inevitability that permeates our thinking about the Rwandan genocide.
 Along the way, he illuminates the responsibility of a wide range of actors from the colonial period through the present. As warlords continue today to compete for power in a thoroughly ravaged Congo, Mr. Chretien helps us understand how this all came about and why it matters that we know.
The story begins with the geography of the central African highlands. Despite its equatorial location, Mr. Chretien says, "the region is blessed with good climate, is rich with diverse soils and plants, and has prospered thanks to some strong basic techniques: the association of cattle keeping and agriculture; the diffusion of the banana a millennium ago; and the mastery of iron metallurgy two millennia ago." In this healthy environment, complex social structures evolved in which the idea of kingship and strong central authority took hold and flourished for more than 300 years before the arrival of colonial powers in the mid-19th century.
The fertile lands around the Great Lakes were settled by indigenous Hutu cultivators, while the more mountainous areas were used for the raising of cattle by Tutsi pastoralists. In the early kingdoms of the region, agricultural and pastoral systems were integrated because they controlled complementary ecological zones and served mutually beneficial economic interests. As Mr. Chretien argues convincingly, nowhere at this time could the "social dialectic be reduced" to a Hutu-Tutsi cleavage.
That began to change in the 19th century. As social structures became more complex, the success of the central African kingdoms depended increasingly on territorial expansion through raiding, colonizing and annexing of neighboring lands. At the same time, Tutsi cattle raisers in search of more land began to emerge as a new elite and a driving force behind expansion. The kingdoms of Rwanda and Uganda were particularly expansionist, but were soon thwarted by the arrival of colonial powers. The immediate effect of colonialism was to reorient the stratified and dynamic societies of the Great Lakes around competing poles of collaboration with, and resistance to, the new foreign occupiers.
Since these remote societies had been untouched by the slave trade that ravaged Africa's coastal regions, they presented the Europeans with a range of robust aristocracies and royal courts to win over.
At this crucial point, the issue of race entered the picture. Obsessed by their theories of racial classification, 19th- and early-20th-century Europeans rewrote the history of central Africa. Imposing their own racist projection of superiority on Tutsi "Hamito-Semites" and a corresponding inferiority on Hutu "Bantu Negroes," missionary and colonial historians began to attribute the rise of the Great Lakes kingdoms to the arrival of a superior race of "black Europeans" from the north.
Mr. Chretien quotes many examples of this toxic "scientific ethnicism," which the Belgians purveyed to their central African colonies until just before independence. A typical example from a colonial school newspaper in Burundi in 1948 states that "the preponderance of the Caucasian type is deeply marked" among the Tutsi, making them "worthy of the title that the explorers gave them: aristocratic Negroes." 
Anointed by the Belgians as their administrators and collaborators in Rwanda and Burundi, the Tutsis, who never constituted more than 18 percent of the population, were presented with a poisoned chalice combining ethnic elitism with economic favoritism. 
In educating their chosen elites, the Belgians were relentlessly racist. Starting in 1928, all primary schools in Rwanda were segregated, while at the secondary-school level Rwandan (and later Burundian) Tutsis were three to four times better represented than Hutus. 
Not surprisingly, the majority Hutu population chafed at this discrimination, and in the late 1950's a Hutu counter-elite began calling for the end of "Tutsi feudalism." On the eve of independence, the growing Hutu rebellion was backed, in a catastrophic reversal, by the Roman Catholic Church and the colonial administration, which now claimed that the Hutu majority represented "democratic values." The outcome, as Mr. Chretien shows, was that "the new Rwanda declared its national past 'Tutsi' and thus despicable."
The post-colonial period was marked by a zero-sum ethnic fundamentalism that destroyed the social fabric. Mr. Chretien argues that "the generation catapulted to the top of the former kingdoms thus squandered the opportunity offered by independence." The deep ethnic insecurities created by European rewriting of African history made the competing ethnic groups far more concerned about their own survival than about the task of nation-building. As a result, he writes, the elites were "haunted by a passion -- which some admitted and others covered up -- about the supremacy of their ethnic group." In Rwanda, the Hutu revolution led to a series of pogroms against the Tutsi minority, culminating in the 1994 genocide. 
Thus, modern hatreds, not ancient ones, destroyed Rwanda. Far from being inbred in the country's ancient social structures, these destructive animosities were created during its recent colonial past. Even then, it took the manipulation of ethnic identity by the country's new elites to produce the atmosphere of fear and recrimination that expanded through the Rwandan countryside and later into vast reaches of Congo in the genocidal war that has gripped the region for nearly a decade.
In this respect, the Rwandans were no different from Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and the other authors of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans. But the world has so far done far less to confront them, and Mr. Chretien's extraordinary book prompts one to wonder whether the reason is rooted in the racism reflected in the violent rewriting of central African history.

HEADLINE: Public College Tuition Increases Prompt Concern, Anguish and Legislation 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
From New York to California, the nation's public colleges and universities have posted eye-popping tuition increases for this fall. Tuition will jump 39 percent at the University of Arizona, 30 percent at the University of California, 28 percent at the State University of New York and 25 percent at the City University of New York.
 Eighty percent of American college students attend public colleges and universities, and their relatively low tuition is often a prime attraction. In the last decade, average tuition at both public and private four-year colleges grew nearly 38 percent, adjusted for inflation. But that has still left tuition and fees at public campuses well below those at private ones: an average of $4,081 at public four-year colleges in the 2002-3 school year, compared with $18,273 at private institutions, according to the College Board. 
 Still, the latest increases are prompting an outcry from students, and policy makers are leaping to their defense. Illinois recently adopted a law guaranteeing that public college tuition will remain flat from the time a state resident enters college, so long as the student remains continuously enrolled. In Washington, attention is focused on a proposal to penalize colleges, public and private, for increases that exceed inflation by a designated amount.
"Colleges and universities have not shown a willingness to contain costs," said Representative Howard P. McKeon, Republican of California, who said he would introduce legislation next month to withdraw federal money from big tuition raisers. 
Government policy makers themselves bear some responsibility for the size of the recent increases, because their own budget problems have led them to cut taxpayer support for public higher education. Many colleges have tried to close the resulting gap with higher tuition. 
In the past, the government has insulated students from the impact of rising costs by picking up a large part of the bill. Since World War II, for example, the federal government has supported the education of returning G.I.'s. And since 1973, it has given billions of dollars of Pell grants to low-income students. State governments have also contributed scholarship aid and paid on average more than half of the operating costs of public colleges in their states.
But as more students have entered college and the higher education tab has ballooned, states are picking up a smaller and smaller share, and public colleges have raised tuition to make up the difference. 
As recently as 1980, state and local governments paid 60 percent of the operating revenues of public colleges, and tuition accounted for only 16 percent. The remainder was from the federal government, gifts and other sources. 
By 2000, the state and local government share had slipped to 51 percent, and tuition's share had climbed to 24 percent. In that period, tuition and fees at public and private colleges, after inflation, roughly doubled.
Morton O. Schapiro, president of Williams College and an economist who studies higher education, said that through the 1990's, many states allocated smaller and smaller portions of their budgets to higher education, but that when budgets were growing, the impact was limited. 
"Around 2001, when state budgets started going into the red," Mr. Schapiro said, "the declining size of the pie and the smaller slice going to higher education made things start to hurt."
Even so, tuition at most public colleges remains well below that at most private ones. Elite colleges like Harvard and Yale that charge $30,000 a year or more in tuition and fees -- and close to $40,000 if room and board are tossed in -- often garner the most attention. 
"Seventeen hundred dollars doesn't seem like much," Mr. McKeon said, referring to last year's average community college tuition, but "22 percent of students eligible for college can't even afford that." 
Many educators say the best way to keep tuition down is to rebuild state subsidies. They would also like to see federal and state governments increase financial aid for needy students by redirecting some of the billions of dollars now being allocated for merit scholarships -- often for good students whose families can afford to pay for college -- and for tax credits and deductions to help the middle class pay for college. 
Industry can offset rising labor costs with productivity gains, but higher education is very labor intensive. Still, some colleges are already cutting back, taking such steps as eliminating faculty positions and reducing class sizes.
Joseph Burke, director of the Higher Education Program at the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany, recommends instead that colleges cut costly areas like doctoral programs and professional studies.
But the case against cuts is deeply rooted, said Patrick M. Callan, president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education.
"We still believe that the most successful institution is the highest-cost institution," Mr. Callan said, "and that the most successful president is one who can raise the institution's prestige by spending money."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Pact on Drugs Stalls Again In Trade Talks

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization failed again tonight in its attempt to approve an agreement to allow poor nations to import inexpensive medicines by relaxing patent and trade laws.
 After two days of discussions and impassioned pleas today from African nations for acceptance of the measure, delegates said they hoped they could reach final agreement at a session on Saturday. 
 Supachai Panitchpakdi, the director general of the trade group, told the full assembly that the proposed agreement deserved acceptance as a "humanitarian issue" that would benefit millions of the world's neediest citizens. 
He also pressed the assembly to settle the drug measure and avoid jeopardizing trade talks in Mexico next month with a mood of "deadlock and distrust," according to delegates who attended the session. 
Gaining access to cheap generic medicines to treat deadly diseases like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis has been a top demand of developing nations for several years.
The United States blocked the current proposal in December, saying that American pharmaceutical companies were reluctant to give up control of their patents.
After months of being accused of putting profits ahead of the needs of some of the world's poorest people, the United States began intensive negotiations this summer and worked out a compromise. Its representatives wrote a statement with four other nations attached to the original agreement that gives pharmaceutical companies assurances that countries selling generic medicines to poor nations would not abuse this privilege.
Several nations, including Argentina and the Philippines, raised questions about that statement today, asking whether these assurances would place too great a burden on countries in need of medicines. Filipino officials said they would approve of the agreement, but they wanted a better understanding of the additional statement, according to officials who attended the session.
Several delegates said the United States was exerting heavy pressure behind the scenes to win approval of the measure.
"It's ironic that they rejected all of our compromises last December and now they want us to accept their compromise post haste with little discussion," said a delegate who insisted on anonymity.
South Africa and India, two of the most powerful countries in the bloc of the developing nations, helped hammer out the new statement with the United States. They offered to hold informal briefings tonight for nations with strong doubts in an effort to win formal acceptance on Saturday.
"Everyone wants an agreement," a delegate who attended the briefing said in a telephone interview from Geneva. "We just need time to reflect and find the same comfort level that American pharmaceutical companies said they needed."

HEADLINE: KOREA ARMS TALKS CLOSE WITH PLANS FOR A NEW ROUND 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Saturday, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
The United States, North Korea and four other nations ended three days of sometimes fiery negotiations here on Friday and decided to keep talking, as Bush administration officials concluded that the diplomatic track still offered the best hope of resolving the Korean nuclear crisis.
 Though North Korea repeatedly threatened to test and deploy nuclear weapons if its demands for a nonaggression pact were not met in full, several senior administration officials said the six-party negotiations had in some respects "exceeded our expectations," persuading them to push for a new round soon. 
 The officials expressed satisfaction that China, Russia, South Korea and Japan had joined the United States in telling North Korea that it had no rational choice but to drop its confrontational attitude and abandon its nuclear program. 
They said they hoped that the unified message would register clearly with Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader. 
"We knew from the outset that this was going to be a very difficult process with a very difficult interlocutor," a senior administration official said. "But we set a policy direction that has proven promising. We intend to stay the course."
The moderately upbeat comments came even though the United States and North Korea did not bridge any significant differences during the sometimes tense discussions. 
North Korean officials stuck closely to scripted positions and offered no concessions, while the United States insisted that it would not discuss any economic or political benefits for North Korea until that country unilaterally dismantled its nuclear program.
The official North Korean press agency issued a bellicose critique of the talks -- which were sponsored by the North's onetime military and political ally, China -- in which it said the North had been "betrayed." It demanded that the United States offer it a nonaggression treaty before it would dismantle its atomic bombs.
"If our reasonable proposal is turned aside, we will judge that the U.S. does not intend to give up its attempt to stifle the D.P.R.K. by force," the agency said, referring to the formal name for North Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. "In this case the D.P.R.K. cannot dismantle its nuclear deterrent force but will have no option but to increase it."
A member of North Korea's delegation to the talks, who did not identify himself, told reporters in Beijing today that he saw no need for further talks. "We are no longer interested. Our expectations have diminished," he said, but did not provide details.
The six nations did not issue a joint communique despite China's attempts to midwife a declaration that would set out common goals for future talks. Even Wang Yi, China's vice foreign minister and the host of the talks, described differences between the United States and North Korea as "comprehensive."
But China announced, and other delegations confirmed, that the six countries had agreed to meet again within two months.
Asian diplomats also noted that North Korea and the United States had agreed on some broad goals. Both said they favored a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula and promised to address the North's security concerns.
"I believe these issues can be resolved," Mr. Wang said. "What is important is to maintain this momentum of dialogue that has not come easily."
The talks could provide fodder for skeptics of the negotiating process, including some members of the Bush administration, who have argued that North Korea does not intend to stop its nuclear program. 
Some of those officials have argued that a much tougher approach, including sanctions, inspections and interdiction of seaborne cargo, and possibly even military action, would be necessary to prevent the reclusive Communist country from becoming a full nuclear power.
American officials said North Korea's chief delegate at the Beijing talks, Kim Yong Il, startled the other negotiators on Thursday afternoon when he declared that his country had developed nuclear weapons and was prepared to prove that it could successfully deliver and explode them. 
Officials said they interpreted the remarks as meaning that North Korea might conduct a nuclear test, presumably underground, as well as missile tests to show thatit could deliver an atomic device to a target.
American and Asian officials said Friday that if North Korea conducted a nuclear test, the Bush administration would end all talks with the North -- and would be likely to move immediately to severe economic sanctions, including the active interception of ships leaving the country.
China, which like the United States has a permanent seat with veto power on the Security Council, has so far strongly resisted the possibility of United Nations sanctions. It is unclear if the talks have changed China's attitude.
Despite the lack of tangible progress, the talks underscored the usefulness of the negotiating track urged on the administration by China, the administration officials said. They said President Bush's proposal to bring together all of North Korea's neighbors around one table had paid dividends when they all made plain that the world could not accept a nuclear North Korea.
The officials also offered a measured assessment of the meaning of the North's latest saber rattling, noting that Mr. Kim had used carefully chosen words to suggest that his country was being compelled into its aggressive posture by the lack of progress in arranging a security guarantee.
The threats, while more specific than past ones, were similar to warnings North Korea made to the United States in a previous round of talks in April, the American officials said. One exception, they said, was that North Korea said in April that it might sell its nuclear weapons to other nations but did not repeat that threat this time.
Proponents of continued negotiations also pointed out that the North Koreans had agreed to not "escalate the situation" as long as talks continued.
Administration officials and Asian diplomats said they felt confident that North Korea had departed with a clear sense that it could not count on China, Russia or South Korea to take its side against the United States. In negotiating sessions, Japanese and South Korean diplomats pointedly rebuffed the North's arguments that the United States was preventing them from investing and trading with North Korea, they said.
Moreover, the officials said, the four other nations taking part in the talks heard North Korea confirm that it had nuclear weapons. In previous sessions North Korea had made such statements only to the United States.
"The situation now is that the five parties are seized by the nature of this threat," an administration official said. "It will make it much easier for us to work together to find a solution."

HEADLINE: Million Youth Event Returns, Not to Harlem, but to Brooklyn 

BYLINE:  By DAISY HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Organizers of the Million Youth March announced yesterday that the rally would return this year for the first time since 2000, taking place in Brooklyn instead of Harlem and stressing peaceful activities like voter registration. 
 The march, set to start on Sept. 6 at 10 a.m., will make its way along Fulton Street, a busy commercial thoroughfare, between Franklin and Nostrand Avenues in Bedford-Stuyvesant. The previous events took place in Harlem in 1998, 1999 and 2000, the first resulting in violence. 
 "Brooklyn is the heart of black America," said Malik Zulu Shabazz, the march's lead organizer and chairman of the New Black Panther Party, adding that Harlem was slowly being gentrified. "We're marching right here in the community where we live and where the people are."
The Young Democrats of Brooklyn and a college sorority will register new voters, and Mr. Shabazz said he hoped to announce the establishment of a phone number that residents can call with information about black-on-black violence. The rap musicians Nas and Dead Prez are scheduled to perform, and local leaders, including Councilman Charles Barron of Brooklyn, will speak.
The Police Department initially denied the organizers a permit, saying the event would come too soon after the West Indian American Day Parade, which takes place on Monday a block from the march's route. Mr. Shabazz objected, accusing the department of racism, and the permit was granted.
Despite its name, the march has never attracted more than a few thousand participants. The biggest rally, in 1998, drew about 6,000 participants, according to police estimates. Mr. Shabazz said he expected this year's event to draw 20,000.
The first Million Youth March, promoting a message of black empowerment, ended in violence as police officers tried to impose a curfew at 4 p.m. Eleven people were injured, and community leaders accused march organizers of inciting anti-Semitism and violence. The 1999 and 2000 events took place without incident.
In the weeks leading up to the first rally, its founder, Khallid Abdul Muhammad, frequently expressed antiwhite sentiments, leading to public clashes with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Since Mr. Muhammad's death in 2001, Mr. Shabazz said, organizers have rethought their strategy and are now emphasizing the need to stop violence among black youth.
The move to Brooklyn was good news to merchants like Gianni Fontana, a manager at Not Just Pizza on Fulton Street.
"It's definitely going to be a good day for business," he said, adding that sales had been slow with the rise of unemployment.
He said was not worried about the violence that marred the first year and was actually hopeful about what a musical and political event could do.
"In a neighborhood like this, people need it," Mr. Fontana said. "You need something that brings people together."

HEADLINE: Success Is in the Grapes; 
From a Scruffy Past, a Winemaking Capital Emerges

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: GREENPORT, N.Y., Aug. 22 

 BODY:
On the far end of Long Island's North Fork, a new winemaking region has flowered in recent years, and this little dot of a village, once among the scruffiest and saddest on all of Long Island Sound, has emerged as its unlikely capital.
 There is a certain poetic continuity to that fact. Greenport was an alcohol fief during Prohibition as well, when accommodating residents would light fires on the beaches to guide in the rumrunner's boats under cover of darkness. But this new turn, for the town and the Sound, goes deeper and broader than anything before, planners, politicians and residents say. Economic and environmental forces coalesced here to create what many people say is anew kind of place -- part Napa Valley chic, part maritime brine -- with a new relationship of land, water and people at its heart. 
 It is a journey of deep uncertainty. The Sound, environmentalists and scientist say, is becoming, more and more, a managed natural system even as its managers learn how devilishly difficult that is to do. And some people here fear that Greenport's new economic vitality cannot fully be controlled either. 
But there is also clearly a sense of wonder that things turned out as they have. Winemaking grew from 17 acres on a single vineyard planted 30 years ago a few miles down the road, to nearly 3,000 acres and 26 wineries today. Hardly anyone thought wine grapes could flourish. And many people had put Greenport down for the count as well. 
"This is one of the last great places," said Ed Jurczenia, 59, who grew up in Greenport after his parents opened a motel in the 1950's called the Silver Sands, which he now helps run. "But, as a lot of people in Napa Valley say, 'Beware of success,' because you might have too much."
How Greenport got to this point is astonishing enough. At the bottom, in the late 1970's, half the downtown stores were vacant and homes could be had for $20,000. Then came the wine, and, in the 1990's, the gambling industry in Connecticut. (Greenport happens to be the conduit for millions of Long Islanders heading toward the cross-Sound ferries at Orient Point.) Improving water quality in the last few years has even inspired oyster growers to re-seed some of the beds in Greenport's harbor that have been unused for a generation. 
"Years ago, the question was how to make it a success," said David E. Kapell, Greenport's 54-year-old mayor, who is credited by most people -- and blamed by a few -- for leading the charge of the town's transformation. "Now we've got success by the tail; the question is how to manage it."
Mr. Kapell and others say that negotiating Greenport's future means accommodating elements of its past, including the imprint left by the years of decline. Many low-income people were drawn here by cheap rents over the last few decades, and still about 20 to 25 percent of Greenport's 2,100 residents live in federally subsidized housing, according to town figures. What will become of those people as rents and demand go up is the community's great social question.
Eddie Alaia, 68, a retired furniture mover who has lived here since the early 1950's, pays $453 a month for a subsidized two-bedroom house a block from downtown. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Alaia sat on his wooden porch and smoked, shirtless and showing off his many tattoos. He said he had no idea where he and his handicapped son would go if they couldn't live here. "Places are hard to find now," he said. "Where am I going to find a place in Greenport? It's all tourists."
Still, Mr. Alaia believes what has happened is good for Greenport, and he said that Mayor Kapell was on the right track: "He's doing great. He says you're getting new streets and sidewalks, it happens."
The old Greenport, the one people like Mr. Alaia moved into, was still very much a sea town and a fishing port with all the attendant smells and clamor. Longtime residents still remember the huge pile of oyster shells -- two stories tall by some accounts -- that used to grow through the summer in the center of town.
It was also an anchor and compass point in the yachting and sailing world. If you were sailing north to Nantucket Island, Mass., or rounding Montauk, or just day-tripping from the Sound's inner reaches to the spot where the Atlantic Ocean blusters into the Sound's mouth, Greenport offered a meal and mooring place for the night at Mitchell's Marina and restaurant. John Steinbeck and his French poodle, Charley, began their journey to rediscover America from here in the early 1960's aboard the ferry to New London, Conn.
By the 1970's, much of that old world might as well have been a dream. Mitchell's restaurant burned to the ground in 1978, and the marina closed soon after. Greenport became known as having some of the worst slums on Long Island.
But even then, during the darkest years, the change was coming. Alex and Louisa Thomas Hargrave, who are now generally credited with starting the wine culture on Long Island, moved here as idealistic newlyweds in 1973 and planted pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon grapes, in a place where the best wine minds said it could not be done.
In a recently published memoir about those years, Ms. Hargrave described the wonder of rediscovering an environment that people had labored in for centuries -- but which had never, it turned out, been fully understood. The deep soil left on Long Island by the glaciers was perfect for grapes. The juxtaposition of land and water -- the Sound on one side, Peconic Bay on the other -- provided a climatic buffer that moderated the winters just enough.
"And then for me there was the smell of the salt sea," Ms. Hargrave writes in her book, "The Vineyard: The Pleasures and Perils of Creating an American Family Winery" (Viking, 2003). "As we looked across the Sound toward Connecticut, I inhaled the sea air deeply. It was the same air, the same Sound in which my maternal great-grandmother had taken her children and grandchildren skinny-dipping."
More vineyards followed, and the new economic pattern has in turn affected that environment. Because the town sits on an extended spit of land jutting up toward New England, with a deep-water port that rarely freezes, Greenport has historically been reached mostly by sea. Now, most visitors come by car. 
The vineyards preserved open space that might have been developed for housing, but also drew 500,000 visitors last year for wine tours, according to the Long Island Wine Council, a trade group. About 1.2 million people took the car-carrying cross-Sound ferry. Traffic on summer weekends through the two roads that feed the North Fork can be horrendous, residents say. Most, though, say the trade-off is worth the price. 
"The grapes saved us -- they kept the open space," said Matthew Mason, a retired New York City transit worker who was sitting by the town's dock on a recent sunny morning. "If it weren't for them, we wouldn't be able to move."
Economists and planners say that, at least so far, Greenport seems to have successfully negotiated its way through this new landscape.
There are few national chains or fast-food outlets in town. The Arcade Department Store, with its narrow aisles and sloping wood floor, still appears to flourish, a monument to 1940's-style retailing. Claudio's Restaurant, which bills itself the oldest restaurant in the United States continuously run by the same family (since 1870), still packs in the tourists. Mitchell's, or at least the park at the town's center where the yard once stood, is the anchor of a proposed new public marina that Mr. Kapell hopes will bring back the sailors and yachtsmen of old. 
"They've transformed from a farming and fishing place and they've avoided the glitz that I see in other places that try to go this route,"' said Wilbur Woods, the director of the waterfront division at the New York City Department of Planning. "I'm impressed."
It takes money to pursue a vision like that. And Mr. Kapell, by all accounts, is a master at getting it. Since his election in 1994, he has been able to obtain state grant money -- in both ways and volumes -- that his predecessors had not, residents and outsiders say. From highway projects to assistance in rebuilding the Mitchell property, the money has flowed as never before. Though some still hold it against him that he was born and raised in Manhattan, 90 miles and a world away -- and the son of a famous concert pianist, William Kapell, to boot -- others say an outsider's perspective made all the difference.
"The mayors who were local didn't have it; they didn't say, 'Let's go for the money,' " said Peter B. Stevens, who came here in the early 1960's and has been running a used bookstore on Main Street called the Book Scout for the last 20 years. "Kapell has put us on the map; he got grant money from all over."
Some residents say the mayor's ambition goes too far. The town has been negotiating, for example, to take over sewage treatment for the nearby community of Shelter Island. The deal, Mr. Kapell said, could mean millions for the town, and Greenport's sewage treatment plant, he said, has extra capacity that is not being used.
"If big plans require us to be a sewer, then something's wrong," said Michael Osinski, 49, a retired software developer who moved to Greenport four years ago.
Mr. Kapell argues that Greenport must retain control of its economic destiny, through whatever resources it can muster, to stave off commercialization and homogenization, which he thinks would be disastrous.
"People come here because it's real and it's a little funky," he said. "With some good luck, it will stay a little funky."

Human Nature
Over many years of settlement, Long Island Sound has been a breadbasket and a dumping ground, a private playground for the wealthy and a symbol of environmental despair. 
But when people reached for a new definition -- a repaired, restored, managed Sound -- nature did not respond according to the rule book. 
For every push to achieve a certain end, the whorls of the ecosystem have pushed right back, often in unexpected ways. 
This is the ninth article of a summer-long series on the evolving nature of Long Island Sound. The final installment goes back to the summer of 1971, when a dozen teenagers and their teachers sailed out for a monthlong science trip to assess the Sound's environmental health -- and found themselves changed in the process.

HEADLINE: German Coalition Team Hints It Will Seek Re-election in 2006 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
With Germany's economy sprouting the first tender shoots of recovery, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder and his coalition partner, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, signaled this week that they planned to run again as a team in 2006.
 The news, which came in remarks by party officials to various German news organizations, appears to reflect Mr. Schroder's confidence that his political fortunes are reviving along with the economy. 
 It also suggests that Mr. Fischer is willing to set aside, at least for now, dreams of becoming the first foreign minister of the European Union under its new Constitution. Mr. Fischer, perhaps Germany's most popular politician, was widely regarded as a leading candidate for that post.
But political analysts said Mr. Fischer's popularity also made him indispensable to Mr. Schroder, whose Social Democratic Party lags behind the opposition Christian Democrats by a wide margin in opinion surveys.
Without the strong performance of Mr. Fischer's Green Party in parliamentary elections last September, Mr. Schroder would not have clung to power. The "red-green" coalition marshaled just enough votes to turn back a challenge by the conservative leader of Bavaria, Edmund Stoiber.
A spokesman for the chancellor said today that Mr. Schroder welcomed Mr. Fischer's decision. "It shows that both men are willing to continue tackling the reform agenda," the official said.
Indeed, political analysts said the show of solidarity by the two leaders was aimed as much at their own parties as at the opposition. They are eager to maintain discipline within the coalition while they try for reforms of Germany's labor market and social programs.
"This is a way for them to say, 'We don't only want to introduce reforms, we really want to see them through,' " said Reinhard Schlinkert, the chairman of Dimap, a polling concern in Bonn.
Mr. Schlinkert said Germans remained skeptical that Mr. Schroder's reform plans would jolt the country out of its economic torpor. But the chancellor has made headway in getting his party and the opposition to agree to cuts in Germany's generous, some say unsustainable, unemployment benefits. This week a government commission proposed raising the retirement age to 67 from 65.
Mr. Schroder also benefited from his decision to accelerate more than $20 billion worth of tax cuts planned for 2005. Economists said the move helped resuscitate Germany's flagging consumer sentiment, though critics warned that it would widen the already yawning budget deficit.
The Finance Ministry confirmed today that the deficit would be 3.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2003, breaching the European Union's ceiling of 3 percent on deficits for the second year in a row.
While Mr. Schroder has focused on domestic issues, Mr. Fischer has worked to mend Germany's relations with the United States. In a visit to Washington last month, he distinguished Germany from France, saying Europe's future lay in partnership, not rivalry.
Mr. Fischer's decision to commit to a re-election campaign belies the conventional wisdom that he wants to trade the German Foreign Ministry for a European post in Brussels.
Peter Losche, a political scientist at the University of Gottingen, said Mr. Fischer's name may have been floated for that job too early. He also observed that a European foreign minister would face a nettlesome task, trying to forge consensus among 22 divergent countries.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
As '04 Nears, Bush Campaign Works on a Theme

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Aug. 28 

 BODY:
When George W. Bush ran for president in 2000, his signature issue was a big tax cut, and despite the narrow margin of his victory, he was able to claim that the election was a mandate for that policy and the others he championed.
 Now, with the 2004 race getting under way, the White House is beginning to look at possible centerpieces for his re-election effort, convinced that the campaign will have to be about more than Mr. Bush's domestic and foreign policy record as president so far. 
 The administration has toyed with a number of ambitious proposals over the last several years, including an overhaul of the tax system. But analysts and people with ties to the White House say the most likely possibility is that Mr. Bush will revive his proposal to remake the Social Security system to add private investment accounts. 
Mr. Bush already seems to be trying out, in a somewhat unpolished way, a sales pitch for such a plan as part of a broader philosophy of what he calls an "ownership society" for people at all income levels.
"We want more citizens owning their own home," Mr. Bush said on Tuesday at a fund-raiser in St. Paul. "We want people to own and manage their own retirement accounts. We want people to have control over their own medical accounts. We want there to be more ownership of small businesses in America because we understand when America and Americans own something, he or she has a vital stake in the future of our country."
Whatever ultimately becomes Mr. Bush's signature issue, his aides and advisers say that one thing is certain: The campaign will be future-looking and feature policy initiatives, not merely point to what he considers his successes: dealing with threats to national security and problems with the economy.
"The old rule of thumb that we used to apply, that I think should still apply, is that politics is always about the future," said Charlie Black, a Republican consultant. "The president should talk about what he's accomplished, but also about the future."
Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director, says that is the plan: "The central plank of his re-election effort will be focused on the future and not on the past."
As Mr. Bush stumps the country raising money and firing up supporters for his re-election campaign, he likes to say that it is not yet time for politics and that for now he is focused on the people's business.
But to the degree that his presidential self can be separated from his political one, he is already defining his candidacy, one with a hefty domestic and foreign policy record from this term and an unfinished agenda from the 2000 campaign.
To the extent that Mr. Bush talks about policy in his public appearances, he focuses on issues he has been pushing since he took office or before, like limiting lawsuit awards and encouraging more domestic oil and gas production. His campaign theme so far is that the nation has faced huge challenges since he took office, and that under his leadership it has risen to those challenges.
"I believe you can tell your neighbor that this administration is meeting the tests of our time," he told contributors last week at a fund-raiser in Portland, Ore.
With Election Day more than 14 months away, it is still early for Mr. Bush to have set out a campaign platform. But Democrats and some political analysts said the administration would have trouble showing it could pay for any new initiatives -- or even for the plans it already has on the table -- because he had presided over a slide into deep budget deficits that could persist for years.
"The president's own fiscal policies, especially his tax cuts, have created deficits so large that they now tie his own hands," said Thomas S. Kahn, staff director for Democrats on the House Budget Committee.
Joshua Bolten, the White House's new budget director, said the administration had been busy enacting the plans Mr. Bush ran on in 2000, including tax cuts and a major education bill, while also pursuing the war on terror. With other major proposals working their way through Congress, like the addition of a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, the administration is starting to look at what ideas should be put forward next, Mr. Bolten said.
"We easily spent our first year and into the second year burning the fuel created during the last campaign," he said. "Now is the more natural time to begin to refuel, and that process is going on now."
Administration officials said that some of the ideas Mr. Bush had been pushing for the last several years remained important and popular even if they were not new. Mr. Bolten mentioned lawsuit reform and new trade agreements as examples.
"There's plenty on the president's agenda that doesn't have anything to do with spending money from the treasury," he said.
Beyond that, the administration's projection of a decline in the deficit after next year would leave plenty of room in a second term for new initiatives as part of regular government spending, he said.
In any case, Mr. Bolten said, the government's short-term fiscal condition does not limit Mr. Bush's ability to address long-term challenges like ensuring Social Security's financial viability.
"With respect to Social Security, whether we're running a deficit this year or next year or even five years from now isn't particularly relevant," Mr. Bolten said. "In most of the plans I've seen, a transition to a personal account mechanism would require borrowing a substantial amount from the general fund, but a well-constructed plan means a good prospect for the system to be able to repay the general fund in the farther-out years. So fixing Social Security is an issue that can and should be handled regardless of what our immediate budget situation is."
Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group, said the main reason the campaign would back such a high-stakes plan would be to allow the president to claim a mandate if re-elected. That, Mr. Norquist said, would help Mr. Bush avoid the problem President Ronald Reagan faced when he won a second term in 1984 without campaigning on specific initiatives.
"You can't just run on what you've done," Mr. Norquist said. "Either things are not going as well as you'd like, in which case you're open to criticism that you haven't done enough, or everything is going swell, and you have no agenda that the American people have signed up to support. In 1984 Reagan said, 'Vote for me, I've been swell.' His lack of agenda is one reason he had a rough time in his second term."

HEADLINE: Greenspan Argues Against Strict Rules for Fed 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug. 29 

 BODY:
Fending off critics who say the nation's monetary policy has become too personalized and idiosyncratic, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, stepped up his insistence today that the Fed should continue to have broad discretion and not be hemmed in by formal rules or even by long-established traditions.
 "Some critics have argued that such an approach to policy is too undisciplined, judgmental, seemingly discretionary and difficult to explain," Mr. Greenspan told a symposium here attended by Fed officials and monetary policy experts from around the world. 
 "The Federal Reserve should, some conclude, attempt to be more formal in its operations by tying its actions solely to the prescriptions of a formal policy rule," he continued. "That any approach along these lines would lead to an improvement in economic performance, however, is highly doubtful." 
Mr. Greenspan, who has come under unusually heavy criticism on several fronts in the last few months, appeared to be taking aim at several groups in his remarks.
One group was clearly the growing number of policy experts, as well as some members of Congress, who have argued that the Federal Reserve should adopt a formal target for inflation that would serve as a basic anchor for decisions and make it easier for investors to understand Fed policy.
The Fed chairman has repeatedly opposed any formal reliance on inflation targets, essentially arguing that the world economy is too complex and uncertain for simple policy prescriptions. "Rules by their nature are simple," he said. "They cannot substitute for risk-management paradigms."
But Mr. Greenspan also appeared to be making a broader point. Not only should the Fed remain unconstrained by formal policy rules, he suggested, it should not automatically follow the informal rules that often seem to guide policy decisions.
The most familiar of these informal rules, which are like formulas that help predict Fed policy, is the so-called Taylor Rule that ties decisions on interest rates to underlying trends in economic output, unemployment and inflation.
Mr. Greenspan has long been celebrated for making bold decisions that seemed intuitive, at least from the outside, and that appeared to conflict with traditional policy prescriptions. The most important was his conviction in the mid-1990's that American productivity was climbing much faster than official statistics indicated and that, therefore, the Fed could allow the economy to grow faster than usual without aggravating inflation.
Most experts praise that judgment as not only correct but as one of the main reasons for the economic boom that lasted until three years ago. Since then, Mr. Greenspan has tried to fight a recession and subsequent sluggish growth by driving interest rates down to their lowest level in four decades.
But critics have argued that Fed policy is too dependent on the instincts of the chairman and that it needs to be anchored in principles that can reliably guide policy after he has retired. Mr. Greenspan is 77 and his term as chairman ends next year. President Bush has said he wanted to nominate him for another term, and Mr. Greenspan has said he would accept the invitation.
In speaking out against formal rules for Fed decision-making, Mr. Greenspan said the world economy was so complex that policymakers could not assume that the economy would behave in the way that standard economic models predict.
As a result, he said, policy makers have to manage risks by sometimes taking action based on the relatively small possibility that something very important and unexpected will happen. Thus, the Fed reduced the overnight Federal funds rate to just 1 percent, and signaled that it would keep it there until well into next year, because it wanted to have what Mr. Greenspan has called "insurance" against a downward spiral into declining prices or another recession.

Harry Macklowe, the developer whose career has died a thousand deaths, came alive again Thursday night when he signed a contract to buy the 50-story General Motors Building for a record-setting $1.4 billion, the most ever paid for a skyscraper in the United States.
 The big gold letters, T-R-U-M-P, that spelled out the name of a former owner of the G.M. Building were stripped from the marble exterior of the trophy tower on Fifth Avenue between 58th and 59th Streets earlier this year. But do not expect Mr. Macklowe, the man who became infamous 18 years ago for his connection to an illegal demolition in Times Square, to splash his name over the skyscraper. 
 According to one person who knows him, Mr. Macklowe has more tasteful plans for the building, whose tenants include Estee Lauder; the Bank of America; Weil, Gotshal & Manges; and the CBS-TV studios. Several rival bidders suggested that Mr. Macklowe could not make money given the price he offered, although similar grousing arose in 1998 when the building sold for $878 million. To get it, Mr. Macklowe did have to outfight and outmaneuver more than two dozen other developers and investors for what is regarded as one of the best office buildings in the world. 
"This would break the record for trophy buildings," said Gerard Mason, executive managing director of Granite Partners, a real estate investment bank that tracks building sales nationwide. "It blows my socks off and it should blow skeptics away. The trophy deal is not dead yet."
If, as expected, the deal is completed in a month, Mr. Macklowe will be paying $1.4 billion, or about $800 a square foot, the most by far for a single office tower and on a square-foot basis, Mr. Mason said. 
The previous records were the $1.05 billion, or $630 a square foot, that Boston Properties paid to buy Citigroup's headquarters at 399 Park Avenue last year, and the $700 million, or $700 a square foot, that Lehman Brothers paid for 745 Fifth Avenue in 2001. 
Although office rental rates are down and vacancies up in New York, sales of first-class office towers have remained strong. "This price is a testament to lower interest rates, a global belief in the Midtown market and the resilience of trophy buildings in any market cycle," said Mary Ann Tighe, of the CB Richard Ellis real estate firm. 
The sale is also a sign of the enduring importance of cities, said M. Meyers Mermel, a broker who represented one bidder, and of New York's pre-eminent position for foreign and domestic investors. 
Mr. Macklowe issued a terse statement yesterday afternoon saying that his company, Macklowe Properties, had entered into a deal to buy the building from a subsidiary of Conseco Inc., the Indiana-based financial services company that is struggling to emerge from bankruptcy protection. 
"This is one of the premier buildings and locations in the world, and a superb longterm investment for us," said his spokesman, Howard J. Rubenstein. 
Mr. Macklowe did not provide details, but rival bidders and other real estate executives said Mr. Macklowe delivered his winning bid on Wednesday night. He signed the contract the next evening, putting down a $50 million nonrefundable deposit. Nearly the entire transaction is financed by Wachovia Bank, a relative newcomer to the pricey New York real estate market, executives said. 
The other bidders included Wells Real Estate Funds of Atlanta; Jerry Speyer, chairman of Tishman Speyer, which controls Rockefeller Center; a group headed by the investor Lloyd Goldman; Samuel Zell of Equity Office Partners; the investor Marvin Davis; Aby Rosen of RFR Holdings; a billionaire family from Mexico; and investment groups based in Germany like Paramount and Jamestown. 
Although he had been a prolific builder, Mr. Macklowe really made a name for himself in 1985, when his company tore down two single-room-occupancy hotels on West 44th Street during the night without turning off the gas or obtaining permits. He was not criminally charged, but he paid the city $2 million to settle a civil lawsuit, and one of his executives pleaded guilty to criminal misdemeanor charges. Years later, he built the Hotel Macklowe on the site. 
But Mr. Macklowe, like many New York developers, lost a string of buildings, including the hotel, to lenders during the recession in the mid-1990's. Three years ago, he was planning his comeback as a commercial developer with a major new office tower on Madison Avenue. But he got into a dispute with his bank and was forced to abandon the project. 
He and his son William continued to develop smaller-caliber projects in Manhattan until the G.M. Building came along. 
Conseco bought the tower in 1998 for about $878 million in partnership with Donald J. Trump, who put up only $11 million for his half-stake in the property. Conseco guaranteed $700 million in financing, while Mr. Trump ran the building. But Conseco soon collapsed under the weight of its debt and the partners had a falling out. They settled their differences after Mr. Trump lost a court battle in June, clearing the way for a sale; his name came off the building the next day. 
"It's a great building in a great location," Mr. Trump said yesterday. "I did a great job in order to make it a great building."
Conseco hired Eastdil Realty to conduct an auction, expecting to get up to $1.2 billion for the property. More than two dozen bidders weighed in, several with bids of $1.3 billion, according to real estate executives. Nine bidders showed up on Wednesday, including a newcomer, Mr. Macklowe, who was willing to commit $50 million, a sum that separated him from the bunch.

HEADLINE: United Delays Its Emergence From Chapter 11 Until Next Year 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Shifting course yet again, United Airlines said yesterday that it did not expect to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings this year after all, blaming an uncertain economic outlook for prolonging its work on a restructuring plan.
 United officials told a United States Bankruptcy Court in Chicago that the airline now expected to leave Chapter 11 protection sometime in the first half of 2004. United, a unit of UAL, is the nation's second-largest airline behind American Airlines. 
 Last spring, executives at United, including its chief executive, Glenn F. Tilton, projected that the airline would emerge from bankruptcy as early as December, a year after it sought court protection. At that time, the airline also signaled that its restructuring proposal would be ready by September or October. 
Those projections were made when Wall Street was criticizing United for dragging its feet on drafting a comeback plan. In particular, analysts noted that US Airways, the seventh-largest carrier, required only eight months to prepare a restructuring plan and emerge from bankruptcy protection after it filed for Chapter 11 last summer.
United's optimism also coincided with the start of the busy summer travel season, a critical time for airlines. United, like its competitors, suffered a sluggish start to the year because of terrorism fears, the war in Iraq and the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.
In hindsight, analysts said that Mr. Tilton's bullishness might have been more an effort to build optimism about United's fortunes among customers and investors, rather than to provide a working timetable. In any case, the latest shift in timing puts United back pretty much to its initial estimate, made at the time it filed for bankruptcy protection, that it would emerge in early 2004.
In court testimony yesterday, James Sprayregen, United's lead bankruptcy lawyer, said the main reason for the delay was the uncertain atmosphere surrounding the airline industry, which is expected to lose $8 billion this year on top of steep losses in 2002 and 2001.
Airlines have enjoyed strong traffic this summer, and United has accumulated a healthy cash balance, which stood at $2.3 billion in July. But executives throughout the travel industry widely expect sluggish bookings to resume after Labor Day.
"It still remains to be seen whether the revenue recovery will be short-lived or long-lived," Mr. Sprayregen said.
Earlier this year, United obtained $2.56 billion in wage and benefit concessions from its unions, after asking the court to impose them if union members did not agree. It has cut costs and routes, and has been involved in negotiations with the airports it serves, its bondholders and the leaseholders on its airplanes in an attempt to save more money.
The most important milestone facing the airline is its new application to the Air Transportation Stabilization Board for $900 million in federal loan guarantees, which would provide the centerpiece of its financing plan to emerge from bankruptcy.
United's bankruptcy filing followed the stabilization board's rejection of the airline's initial application for loan guarantees, which the board criticized as incomplete and based on overly rosy assumptions. United updated that application twice during the stabilization board's deliberations, as competitors complained that United was being unrealistic.
This time, United officials have been told the board wants to see just one version of a plan, people close to the discussions said. But forecasts about the future direction of the industry are proving tough to pin down, given the uncertain economic climate, these people said, giving United a reason to wait.
The airline has not decided when it will submit a plan, Mr. Sprayregen said yesterday. It most likely would submit proposals simultaneously to the stabilization board, its creditors and the bankruptcy court.
Despite United's caution, Kevin P. Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, representing business travelers and corporate travel departments, said that United's latest move could cause his members to lose faith in the airline out of frustration with its pronouncements.
For example, United insisted after its bankruptcy filing that it had to create a separate low-fare carrier. It has since stepped back from that plan, which was nicknamed Starfish.
"It looks like they're lurching from one tactic to another, from one strategy to another," Mr. Mitchell said.
Another issue facing the airline is whether it needs to take action regarding its four employee pension funds, which have an unfunded liability of $6 billion to $7.5 billion. The plans cover roughly 145,000 employees and retirees.
Not all of the pension funds are in equally bad shape. At the end of 2001, the most recent period with information available, the ground employees' plan was about 99 percent funded, the pilots' plan was 98 percent funded, and the administrative employees' plan was about 93 percent funded, according to documents at the Labor Department. However, the flight attendants' plan was only 88 percent funded, and all those levels almost assuredly have fallen because of the decline in the stock market last year, experts said.
People inside and outside the company said United was considering options that included postponing some of its pension contributions, contributing its own stock to the pension plans, freezing benefit accruals, and terminating one or more of its pension plans entirely.
In addition, United is one of several airlines seeking pension relief through proposed legislation that would exempt all the major airlines from the rules governing pension funding. Such a bill is pending in the House, but it is considered a long shot. While proponents say the airlines have unique problems that merit special relief, others say that giving pension relief to the airlines would prompt other troubled industries to demand relief as well, leading to further pension deficits and putting benefits at risk.
Other airlines have been allowed to take extraordinary measures to cope with their pension obligations. US Airways won court permission to cancel its pilots' plan, which guaranteed a high level of benefits, and replace it with a version that was less secure. Northwest Airlines won government approval to contribute stock of its Pinnacle Airlines unit to its pension plan, in lieu of cash.
Although United does not have a subsidiary comparable to Pinnacle, it could use its new shares after reorganization to help shore up its employee pension plans. That could meet with employee resistance, given their experience with the employee stock ownership plan that was wiped out by bankruptcy. And if United wanted to make a significant stock contribution -- more than 10 percent of pension fund assets -- it would have to get special approval from the Labor Department.
United could also conserve cash by postponing some of its annual pension contributions. Such postponements are regulated by the Internal Revenue Service, which allows any pension plan to waive up to three annual contributions in any 15-year period.
The waivers do not come automatically. The I.R.S. has tightened its requirements in recent years. Companies must now post collateral for the amount waived, and for any waiver over $1 million, the I.R.S. consults with the agency that insures pensions on whether the collateral is adequate. That agency, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, has tightened its standards as well, after being left holding unusual assets like airport gates and buildings after previous pension defaults.
United is not facing a cash shortage yet, however, despite its pension deficit. It was able to avoid making any cash contributions in 2001, 2002 or in the first half of this year, because the plans built up large "credit balances" during the stock market boom of the late 1990's.
Pension rules allow actuaries to book a pension fund's stock market gains as if they were, in fact, cash contributions by the sponsoring company. If the stock market then falls, these accounting entries remain on the books, where they may be used in subsequent years to offset the contributions the company would otherwise have to make.
United has disclosed that it expects to use up the remainder of its credit balances in the second half of this year, and that it might have to contribute $4.2 billion to its various pension funds by the end of 2008.

 BODY:
 MONSTER OF GOD
The Man-Eating Predator
in the Jungles of History and the Mind.
By David Quammen.
515 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $26.95.
 "In wildness is the preservation of the world," Henry David Thoreau famously said, not knowing the half of it. David Quammen's splendid book "Monster of God" constitutes an expansion and gloss on Thoreau's prophetic contention, achieved through an artful, focused account of contemporary efforts to secure preservation, in the wild, of some of the most magnificently fearsome creatures on earth -- the large-bodied carnivores, man-eaters (lions, tigers, Carpathian brown bears, giant crocodiles), a group Quammen designates "alpha predators." The stories he presents contain rich detail and vivid anecdotes of adventure, and they provide skillful capsulizations of the politics, economics, cultural history and ecological dynamics bearing on the fate of each of these cornered populations.
Every country with enclaves of habitat crucial to the survival of these endangered monsters is trying, belatedly, to stem the tide of extinction flowing inexorably from human settlement and industry. To achieve physical asylum for these animals, there appear to be only two approaches. One is to create protected areas large enough to sustain stable breeding populations and outlaw poaching, and to experiment with ways of limiting damage to human beings exposed to danger in and around such zones. The second approach is to do the same thing, but combined with an officially regulated offtake of the great beasts, through licensed hunting or harvesting for skins or other valuable body parts. Whether either approach can save these creatures is the ultimate subject of Quammen's investigations.
Describing the predicament of the Gir lions of India, saltwater crocs in Australia, Carpathian bears and the Amur tigers of Siberia, he revisits in each instance the central questions that these exercises in biological conservation entail. Why should it be done? How can it be done, and is commercialized offtake an inevitable part of any workable scheme? Who will suffer if conservation schemes for alpha predators succeed, and how can the continuing suffering of vulnerable human populations be justified? And if this exercise fails, if we are left with only captive populations of monsters in the zoos of the world, what would that mean -- culturally, metaphysically, practically? The author faces these questions humanely and unblinkingly.
Quammen's study of the Gir lions neatly displays his talent as a science reporter and storyteller. This remnant colony of Panthera leo persica, a few hundred strong, inhabits the Gir Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park on the Kathiawar Peninsula, not far from Bombay. For centuries, the lions have shared this territory with people called Maldharis, who herd cattle and buffalo. The particulars of that coexistence are fascinating:
"Life, as they choose to live it, is hard and elemental. It's harder still for their animals. A milk cow is no challenge to a hungry lion but, defended by a herder with the light tool known as a kuwadi that is commonly carried, the cow has at least a chance of escape. Buffalo are slightly more capable of lowering their horns and taking a stand on their own, which may be why they predominate in Maldhari herds. . . . Insofar as it's possible to make a categorical statement about the private lives of an extraordinary, little-studied group of people, here's one: Maldharis don't own guns. Their battles with the lions approximate hand-to-hand combat, not safari hunting or varmint eradication. Their chief weapon, the kuwadi, is barely more than a short-handled hoe. Their relationship to Panthera leo persica is wary but intimate. Rarely does a herder get hurt. Part of being a Maldhari, at least at Gir, is coping routinely with lions through the use of caution, bluff and an occasional kuwadi-thunk on the skull." 
In passing, Quammen mentions a puzzling fact about Maldharis: they dress in immaculate white cotton outfits. The puzzle is how they are kept so clean, since the forest compounds in which the Maldharis live typically lack "even a well, let alone such amenities as electricity or running water." He doesn't find the answer, which was a disappointment to me because I had been puzzled by the same question in a different setting, in Botswana, where a subgroup of the Kalanga people who specialized in tinsmithing carried on their business in similar immaculateness along dusty roadsides near Francistown.
But of course, Maldharis do occasionally fall victim to lions, especially during drought periods. "It's a general truth," Quammen writes, "if not quite a universal one, relevant from Rudraprayag to Komodo to Tsavo, sometimes noted but seldom quantified or analyzed: predation is costly and the costs are unevenly distributed. Large predators cause more material loss, inconvenience, terror, suffering and death among poor people (specifically poor people who live in rural circumstances within or adjacent to the habitat) and among native people adhering to traditional lifestyles on the landscape . . . than to anyone else. Proximity plus vulnerability equals jeopardy." 
The Indian government has enforced different settlement regimes on the Maldharis, from eviction (a disaster) to limited reoccupation. Lion numbers have risen to a point of crowding, and lions that stray outside the park to seek food must be trapped and sold to zoos. They are not returned to the park. There is no offtake system. All the while, the boundaries of the park are contracting, as agriculture advances in the area.
When it comes to crocodiles, only Australia seems to have devised a viable program. Indigenous people living within Kakadu National Park in the north of the country participate in and benefit economically from an extensive harvesting and breeding operation involving Crocodylus porosus. Croc numbers have recovered strongly (and croc attacks on humans have gone up too).
An Indian initiative to protect the same species, in the mangrove swamps of Orissa, has reached an odd juncture. A wildlife sanctuary was proclaimed, a successful reintroduction was achieved, but now there are too many crocs and the offtake component intended as part of the project -- and designed by the originator of the Australian program -- was simply never instituted. Popular anger in the region is on the rise. In Kenya, Lake Turkana, formerly Lake Rudolf, houses about 14,000 specimens of the very large Crocodylus niloticus species. The lakeside-dwelling Turkana show no desire to exterminate them. Instead they have adapted their animist belief system to incorporate the crocs as messengers of divine judgment; people who are eaten are presumed to have offended against the spirits. There has been talk of establishing a sanctuary area on the north shore of the lake, but no action has been taken. Meanwhile, the lake itself is seriously threatened by pollution. 
In talking about Crocodylus niloticus, Quammen refers to the death 
of William H. Olson, a Peace Corps 
volunteer taken by a croc in the Baro River in Ethiopia in 1966. He repeats a commonly retailed version of this tragic event, to the effect that the volunteers for some reason ignored warnings by local people that a crocodile lurked in the river in which they were planning to swim. There is strong countertestimony on this point by Kathleen Coskran, a member of Olson's party, whose letter to her mother about the incident, written shortly afterward, has been available for several years on the Internet at www.peacecorpswriters.org. In fairness to Olson's family, conclusions on what happened should acknowledge the testimony of this witness and some others to Olson's death that no warning was given to the group. 
In summary, there does seem to be at least some kind of model that, consistently followed, might guarantee a continued wild existence for some crocs. It gives one a funny feeling, though, that this most alien and hideous of the alpha predators should be the one with the best prospects.
The campaigns to rescue alpha predators -- campaigns with such high requirements for forbearance among human bystanders too poor or too culturally entranced to move out of range of these experiments -- stand out oddly against the species extinctions accompanying the continuing human drive fruitfully to occupy the earth. We are compliant, all of us, in the looming extirpation of creatures as neutral toward us as starfish, as friendly as marmosets and as downright helpful as beavers. So what justifies the exceptional treatment given the bad-boy alpha predators? 
Quammen gives his justification in pieces. I believe he would like to come up with something solid that could reasonably be called symbiosis. His first concentration is on the metaphoric -- I'd call it -- value that these animals living in the wild have for human self-understanding. In that connection he explores myth, the functions of these predators in various religions, their chastening effect in reminding us that we are, after all . . . meat. Then he presents the material case for symbiosis, which turns on the proposition that the ecological effect of removing "keystone species" -- which means all of these alpha groups -- is downwardly destructive; disorganizing to the fitness of the predators two, three and four steps lower; and leading ultimately to an unpleasantly, and dangerously, simplified natural world. 
I don't know if these two sorts of justification can be made to work credibly together, in part because taking the "keystone species" argument seriously would seem to necessitate reforesting large portions of the world and giving the alphas free rein everywhere within the new forests. I believe, in truth, that the essential nature of the impulse toward the biological conservation of alpha predators is aesthetic, like much that expresses itself in spiritual or metaphysical language, although this is not to say that those expressions are not powerful in their own way.
Another subject provocatively touched on is the guilty history of the imperial West in its expropriation of hunting rights, the undoing of age-old traditions of predator management worked out by indigenous peoples. Quammen circles around this aspect of imperial dominance, emphasizing the negative consequences for local cultures whose religions and value systems (lion hunting as male coming-of-age ritual, for example) deeply encoded special relationships with alpha predators. (In Botswana today, the imminent installation ceremony for the new chief of the Bayeyi people -- their first female chief -- requires presentation of the pelt of a freshly killed leopard, which will not be obtainable, and for which a display skin from the museum will have to be substituted.) 
A recent study has suggested that an appetite among the 19th-century British elite for unrestricted big-game hunting was a substantial driving force in imperial expansion. But expropriating hunting rights to the great monsters was overdetermined, arising centrally from the will to open up perilous areas for economic exploitation. And it's only fair to recall that the elites of the previously unsubjugated people had themselves been energetic trophy hunters who had presided over the continuing retreat of alpha predators into smaller and smaller habitats. 
"Monster of God" is a treasury of exotic fact and hard thinking. Digressions on subjects like crocodile taxidermy, the odd relationship between crocs and a band of Hell's Angels, the intricacies of sheep's-milk cheesemaking, are full of interest. Vignettes of actors in the drama -- at all levels -- are deftly drawn. Dilemmas and paradoxes involved in the effort to save the monsters are fully canvassed. Quammen reaches somber conclusions. The hour is late, and not only in this part of the forest.

 Sudden Sea
The Great Hurricane of 1938.
By R. A. Scotti.
Illustrated. 279 pp. Boston:
Little, Brown & Company. $24.95.
 The rains that began in May and June, only to be joined by hot, muggy stretches in the months since, could spell more than a washout of a summer. Those whose job it is to translate these weather events into forecasts at, say, the National Weather Service predict that the 2003 hurricane season will be fiercer than usual. But even amateurs can tell you that a tropical summer in New England augurs a tempestuous September.
In fact, these past summer months have not been very different from those of 1938, when, on Sept. 21, a hurricane packing 186-mile-an-hour gusts slammed into southern New England. The Great Hurricane of 1938 was, as detailed in R. A. Scotti's dramatic but uneven "Sudden Sea," the worst weather disaster in the history of the region and the fourth most fatal in United States history. Also called the "Long Island Express," because it covered seven states in seven hours, the 1938 hurricane killed 682 people. Hardest hit was Scotti's home state, Rhode Island, where 433 died. Attacking what one forecaster described as "the most densely populated area in the world" at the time, the hurricane struck Long Island, then made landfall again in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Later, the storm swept through the Berkshires and northward. The gale-force winds took down tens of thousands of trees all the way to Vermont. In Montpelier, windows were covered with salt from a sea more than 100 miles away. The lethal blow, loaded with sand and debris, plucked the feathers off chickens, blasted the paint off cars and deposited an eight-ton DC-2 in a marsh a half-mile from where it had been parked. 
The rain that accompanied the wind had no less an effect, dumping 17 inches in five days on Connecticut and Massachusetts and flooding local rivers. In Hartford, the Connecticut rose almost 20 feet. In Norwich, the Thames River climbed seven feet in an hour. Before the waters receded, the flood line in downtown Providence reached 17 feet above street level.
On the coast, the storm surge, the wall of water conjured by the hurricane's swirling winds and rising tides, wiped out whole beach communities. Giant waves, described in one instance as "soiled gray" and capped by a 10-foot "crest of murky froth," ultimately carved a new coastline. 
But, according to Scotti, neither the wind nor the rain nor the storm surge did as much damage as the fact that there had been no warning broadcast. In 1938, Weather Bureau personnel were not without meteorological tools. But after the thermometer, barometer and hygrometer (to measure humidity), they relied for the most part on "surface observations." Certainly New Englanders weren't expecting the storm. It was only the third major hurricane on record to strike the region. The first was the Colonial Hurricane of 1635, followed by the Great September Gale of 1815. Apparently, Scotti says, the summer of 1815 was also hot and wet. 
In its nascent stages, the 1938 storm was closely tracked in Florida for days. After it had veered away from the coast, forecasters in Washington deemed the storm was no longer a threat. As Scotti explains, it was thought that the colder northern seas would remove the storm's sting. The word "hurricane" was actually edited from an advisory. The bulletin was originally written by a less experienced tracker whose information showed that, among other factors, the northern position of the Bermuda High (a semi-permanent high-pressure cell), combined with an unusual low-pressure system, very much warranted a hurricane alert. 
But the big blow did not lose momentum as expected. And because most watercraft had heeded the earlier warnings, there were few eyewitnesses who could help spot the storm's speedy progress. It's hard to imagine how a hurricane so expertly tracked days before could simply disappear from view, and how it could wreak such damage -- $4.7 billion adjusting for inflation, according to Scotti -- in so little time. Scotti's attempt to provide answers results in an ambitious seven-state sprawl of information.
Relying on published accounts, meteorological analysis and interviews with survivors, she has an inherently gripping story on her hands. There are the facts of the storm, which are monumentally appalling. The human face of loss is even more excruciating. In the aftermath, Scotti writes, it was necessary to count the dead along the beaches of Rhode Island by air because so many "had put on their boots to slog through the water." The heavy boots "weighed the bodies down so that only the tops of their heads were visible."
A writer of thrillers and a memoir about her infant son's fatal illness, Scotti is well versed in the basics of drama. Tugging perhaps a little too forcefully on the heartstrings, she focuses on the helpless. Women step out back doors, never to be seen again, and children die awful (and awfully detailed) deaths. In a particularly overwrought moment, Scotti writes, "Bodies, living and dead, piled up on the shore, battered and entangled by the wreckage of their lives."
AT the center of her story are the devastated people of Rhode Island. In early pages we meet Lillian Tetlow and Jack Kinney, young lovers on a beach who survived the tempest; the four Matoes children, who had the misfortune of taking the bus home from school and were drowned; and Catherine Moore and her family, who sailed out to sea on the only piece of their house that remained intact, the attic floor.
Recounted in vignettes, these scenes -- and others -- are spliced between moments of the gathering storm. As moving as they are meant to be, the passages are hard to follow. One's not always sure which state Scotti's talking about, or where she is in her chronology, much less which hapless bunch she's referring to (even more confusing is that two families share the same name). In a particularly forced story line, Katharine Hepburn's hurricane experience is recounted. (She was at home in Old Saybrook, Conn., when the hurricane hit. Roped together, Hepburn and her family barely escaped drowning as they watched their house wash out to sea.)
Scotti should know that she doesn't have to work so hard to get across what is an intrinsically thrilling tale. Especially considering the summer we've had, a person may wonder exactly where that Bermuda High is hanging out these days.

 FRIEDRICH ENGELS once said that he learned more about postrevolutionary French society from Balzac than from "all the professed historians, economists and statisticians of the period together." The same might be said of slavery in America and these two first novelists, who write about its history not as if it were fixed in time, safely over and done with, but as if anything could happen in the chaos of the moment.
Edward P. Jones's novel, "The Known World," opens with the death of a master of 33 slaves in antebellum Virginia. None of his property grows teary-eyed, though, at the news that Henry Townsend has died. They surely don't know that when he obtained his first slave he wanted to be "the kind of shepherd master God had intended," someone who would provide "good food for his slaves, no whippings, short and happy days in the fields." By his death, he had learned his lesson. It seems he had no choice but to chain a runaway slave in his barn and pay a Cherokee patroller to slice a third of his ear off. A familiar story, perhaps, so far. There's a difference, though. Henry Townsend is black.
In 1855 in Manchester County, Va. (a fictional place standing in for an actual historical landscape), we learn that "there were 34 free black families . . . and eight of those free families owned slaves." Henry Townsend's freedom had been purchased by his father, Augustus, a carpenter who bought his own freedom with money earned from his carvings and furniture, then over time bought his wife and son out of slavery. Henry himself financed his first slaves by making boots and shoes. But why would a former slave himself buy slaves, especially against the wishes of his father? Though the novel never explicitly addresses this question, readers get the message: because slavery was legal and believed to be sanctioned by God, because wealth and status consisted in owning human flesh -- and because Henry "wanted to be a better master than any white man he had ever known."
Among the many triumphs of "The Known World," not the least is Jones's transformation of a little-known footnote in history into a story that goes right to the heart of slavery. There are few certified villains in this novel, white or black, because slavery poisons moral judgments at the root. As Jones shows, slavery corrupts good intentions and underwrites bad ones, yet allows decency the odd occasion -- but only by creating such an enormous need for it.
The freshness of his story lies in its very incongruity and strangeness. Henry's first slave, Moses, takes more than two weeks to process the news "that someone wasn't fiddling with him and that indeed a black man, two shades darker than himself, owned him and any shadow he made. . . . Moses had thought that it was already a strange world that made him a slave to a white man, but God had indeed set it twirling and twisting every which way when he put black people to owning their own kind. Was God even up there attending to business anymore?"
Good question. A known world is one seen and understood by God and therefore fixed and ordained. Jones's world, by contrast, is one that could come to pieces at any moment. After Henry's death, his wife grows dreamy and passive while her slaves betray one another or run off. Jones writes with a sense of narrative foreboding undercut by the erratic nature of events, and the result is a portrait of a society that is seemingly immutable but as tentative and fragile as the map of the Americas for which the novel is titled, hung on the local sheriff's wall. This map finds its echoes in the book's final chapter, when, by 1861, the known worlds of Manchester County and of Henry's plantation have themselves become huge wall hangings in a hotel in Washington, the folk-art creations of one of the story's runaway slaves.
Jones's talent for conjoining the ordinary and the marvelous is partly that of a miniaturist with a novel to write. A finalist for the National Book Award for his collection of stories, "Lost in the City," he constructs "The Known World" as a clockwork mechanism of stories within stories, some appearing as single phrases in a sentence, others spanning the whole book. From Henry's death, he spirals back to the history of a multitude of characters whose stories begin as faraway trickles before they swell into rivers. These characters survive by negotiating mazes of moral contradiction, but they speak with a raw and lyrical bluntness.
Jones has an exceptional ear for speech now buried in the past, though its echoes remain. His own narrative style is doggedly declarative, slow, persistent, imperturbable and patient, but it gets the job done. To call this novel mule-paced is not to be captious. Mules are noble animals in the world of the novel, and smarter than horses -- they won't work until they drop. I could have done without the gratuitously bloody ending, if only because by then Jones has so effectively shown that the death of the heart was slavery's worst horror. Still, "The Known World" is an achievement of epic scope and architectural construction, which nonetheless reads like a string of folk tales told by someone slyly watching for your reaction -- tales told by a conjurer who distracts you so well that you never know what hit you.
Another novel about slavery, this one set in New York State (where slavery was legal until 1827), tells the story of the remarkable Sojourner Truth. The despised and the revered are first to lose their humanity in historical depictions, and even during her lifetimeSojourner Truth was both. Jacqueline Sheehan's "Truth" attempts to flesh out this abolitionist heroine and bring her down to earth, and often it succeeds. Sheehan depicts the basic facts of the life of this slave first known as Isabella: her childhood in a cold, dark cellar; her sale at auction at the age of 9; the brutal whippings and sexual torture she experienced at the hands of two of her owners; her attachment to a religious charlatan named Matthias; her visions of God, who instructs her to take the name Sojourner Truth; her meetings with Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln; and her electrifying speeches against slavery and for women's rights.
The most gripping scenes may very well be those that explore her involvement with a religious community called Mount Zion and its founder, Matthias. This section of the novel describes a conjunction of religious and sexual frenzy involving communal baths, the search for a "match spirit" to sleep with, beatings, fits and ultimately a murder trial. It alone could have been rich material for a novel. And it also raises a fascinating question: how often has American religious history played variations on "Tartuffe"?
Sojourner Truth herself comes most fully alive in Sheehan's final pages. There the excitement of her public appearances, her simple and profound eloquence, her caustic wit in handling hecklers, her ability to "toss a blanket of laughter over the ice of truth," are all strikingly captured. But can we call this book a novel? Sheehan never solves the problem of how to shape her material, and the resulting story often reads less like a work of fiction than a biography in drag. (Unlike Jones, who includes no notes or appendixes, Sheehan adds a bibliography and a timeline.)
The bulk of the narrative describes Sojourner Truth's early life, told in the first person with a pell-mell forthrightness that seldom lets up but seldom transcends itself either. Most first-person novels have layered narrations in which a younger self on the edge of experience exists within an older self engaged in looking back -- an older self who renders the life, who gives it structure or design. In "Truth," the chronological narration seems instead to attenuate the life, to make it little more than a recitation of one thing after another. Nor does Sheehan attempt to capture a 19th-century vernacular; we must take her contemporary language on faith as a sign of her central character's spirit, not a material embodiment of it. As a result, although Sheehan's writing is often lively and vivid and although her feel for historical detail is fine, her novel never really feels like an artifact of the past.

HEADLINE: THE NEW GROUND ZERO; 
. . . With A Dubious Idea Of 'Freedom'

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
VOIDS are made for shape-shifting: images of transformation sparked by hope for the future and fear of the unknown. For almost two years, many images have taken the form of possible "cultural uses" for ground zero. An opera house by Sir Norman Foster? An art museum by Frank Gehry?
 These are plausible, even worthy ideas. But they are misplaced. They could go anywhere. While they may satisfy the craving to fill up the void, as quickly as possible, they bear no historical relationship to the events that brought the void into being. 
 Nor do they match the cultural value of the void itself. That vast emptiness has stimulatedthe public to create its own self-portrait in the incessant stream of fantasies that people have been sketching around this site since Sept. 11. 
The most recent of these fantasies has just arrived in the form of a small brochure titled "The Campaign for a Museum of Freedom." Put out by a committee headed by Tom A. Bernstein, co-owner of the Chelsea Piers sports complex on the Hudson River, the pamphlet outlines in general terms an idea that has been circulating for more than a year in civic and political circles.
Unlike the art museum and opera house, the Museum of Freedom does emerge from the specific historical circumstances of the site. Unfortunately, as described in the brochure, the concept distorts those circumstances toward political ends. I have a strong suspicion that this campaign is going to fail.
Still, the pamphlet deserves a prominent place in the permanent record of ground zero fantasies. Brief as it is, this document nonetheless performs a valuable service. It exposes, more explicitly than we critics have, the degree to which the ground zero design process has become saturated with political ideology.
The cover bears an artist's rendering of an aerial view of the site, as it might appear if Daniel Libeskind's drawings were to be realized as actual buildings. We're looking down, toward a green open space encircled by the famous spiral of skyscrapers. Though the rendering is crude, it nonetheless captures the crystalline quality of Mr. Libeskind's formal vocabulary, and his design's indebtedness to German Expressionist architecture of the 1910's and early 1920's.
The chamfered tops of the glass towers, the diagonal patterns of their window mullions, convey the impression that these are the shattered remnants of much larger buildings: the twin towers, by implication. The spiral configuration replicates what the Expressionists called the Stadtkrone, or city crown. Designed for mass spectacle and social ritual, these fruits of the Weimar Republic remained fantasies on paper. Though possibly unaware of this historical precedent and its complex cultural associations, the Museum Planning Committee obviously envisions the Sadtkrone as a worthy model for this site.
The open space is dominated by a large object of faceted glass that resembles an immense diamond solitaire. Since none of the structures shown in the rendering are identified, it's not clear whether this form is intended to represent a building or a sculpture. To judge from its central placement, however, the jewel-like shape could be a place-holder for the memorial now being planned.
Lower structures, partly formed from the bases of the skyscrapers, enclose two sides of the green open space. Also rendered to suggest faceted glass, these structures are tinted in blue and red: patriotic colors, perhaps, or hints of sapphires and rubies. Indeed, with the white diamond glow of the towers and the emerald grass of the open space (itself shown as a tapestry of light refracted through crystal), the entire rendering evokes a gigantic parure of precious stones. Students of Expressionism will have no difficulty recognizing a precedent for this image in Bruno Taut's Alpine Architecture, one of the best-known examples of the Stadtkrone genre.
A second rendering moves in for a closer view of the site. It's still an aerial perspective -- figures on the ground register as dots -- but the angle of vision has shifted, and the focus is on the lower crystalline structures. Perhaps these are meant to indicate the Museum of Freedom's location and scale. The palette has changed, from precious stones to harlequin colors, red and green, composed in the traditional diamond-shaped motley of commedia dell'arte costumes.
Kunhardt Productions, makers of a PBS documentary series, "Freedom: A History of US," is credited with developing the design and content of the museum. The brochure describes the project as integral to Mr. Libeskind's "unifying concept" of the master plan: "the 'assault' on freedom." Like the word "campaign" and the fragmented forms of the towers, the content proposed for the museum is consistent with this martial motif.
The content is programmed in four educational "modules" that recount, in concentric rings, mankind's struggle for emancipation from mental and physical enslavement. Ground zero, the site of the terrorists' assault, is the subject of the first module. As we proceed outward through the rings, the narrative encompasses more and more territory, like an advancing army: New York ("the world's second home"). America ("the story of its ever-widening circle of freedom"). Last, but not least, the World ("will shine a spotlight on places that lack basic human freedoms").
The brochure is seasoned with quotes from Abraham Lincoln, George Bush, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Emma Lazarus and even Mr. Libeskind. It is adorned with archive photographs (the Berlin Wall) and comes complete with budget estimate ($250 million) and a note on financing: "The Museum of Freedom will be a public-private partnership that will rely on funding from government sources as well as the private sector."
Save your money. I have a much simpler and cheaper idea in mind. Consistent with the values of historic preservation, not to mention the theme of freedom, I propose reconstructing a project that stood not far from ground zero for a brief time in the summer of 1984.
Entitled Freedom of Expression National Monument, this collaborative project was designed by the New York artist-architect team of Laurie Hawkinson, John Malpede and Erika Rothenberg. It was produced by Creative Time's Art on the Beach program, which occupied the landfill created by excavations for the World Trade Center, and is now the site of Battery Park City. Anita Contini, who now heads the memorial design committee for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, was at that time Creative Time's director.
Inspired by early Soviet agit-prop art, the monument consisted of a large red megaphone mounted atop a flight of stairs and pointed toward the twin towers. Visitors were invited to climb the stairs and, in effect, talk back to those massive symbols of state authority and economic power. As the team put it, using the megaphone made people feel "both powerful and powerless at the same time."
To my knowledge, there exists no record of the statements made by visitors to the monument: the curtain had yet to rise on the brave new world of ceaseless digital documentation. This omission could be easily rectified were the monument to be rebuilt today, however, and the need for such a public platform has never been greater than it is now.
Throughout the ground zero design process, many New Yorkers have felt "powerful and powerless at the same time." They have spoken, but with little conviction that they are being heard. Should I have a turn at such a mouthpiece, this is what I would say:
Not everyone saw the twin towers as symbols of freedom. For some, they represented the Kafkaesque mental enslavement of government bureaucracy and dull office routine. For others, they stood for Rockefeller power: for oil, that is to say, and the bizarre things we do to satisfy our need for it.
NOT everyone thinks that the United States is ideally poised at this moment to point fingers at "places that lack basic human freedoms." I note, with approval, that the Freedom Museum will be linked to the International Coalition of Historic Site Museums of Conscience. But I see scant evidence of conscience in the brochure. Us good, others bad: where's the conscience in that?
Ideally, I would like to voice such opinions without being branded a traitor, a pro-terrorist, or a person opposed to freedom. But I see no indication that your museum will be much help in this regard. I see only one underlying assumption expressed in your brochure: freedom has been assaulted, therefore retaliation is legitimate -- even more, is part of the heroic struggle that includes the cause of civil rights.
On the basis of this assumption, the victims of Sept. 11 have been posthumously enlisted as martyrs to a cause they may or may not have supported. But we will never know. And it is not our decision to make.
At what point does a cultural use like your educational modules become indistinguishable from a strategy room for territorial expansion? Will your museum encourage honest debate on issues like this? Martial rhetoric is seldom a sure-fire sign of tolerance for dissent.

HEADLINE: THE NEW GROUND ZERO; 
Honoring the Dead in the City That Never Weeps

BYLINE:  By JAMES SANDERS; James Sanders is an architect and the writer, with Ric Burns, of the PBS documentary series "New York." The final episode, on the history of the World Trade Center, will be broadcast Sept. 8.

 BODY:
FROM the very start of serious planning, it was clear that the Sept. 11 memorial at ground zero would face a host of obvious and largely unprecedented challenges. As the design effort has proceeded, however, a less obvious challenge has begun to make itself felt. It arises from the fact that the commemorative ground sits right in the heart of Lower Manhattan, amid the busy streets and soaring towers of the downtown business district. It is the challenge of creating a memorial in a city that, for most of its history, has abhorred the very idea of memorials.
 This aversion to memorials -- and in a larger sense to monuments of any kind -- is an instinct so deep-seated and pervasive that it is built into the city's structure. The instinct can be traced to the origins of the modern city and to a pair of decisions, made two centuries ago, that helped determine the essential shape and character of New York. 
 The first came toward the end of a long and momentous dinner at Thomas Jefferson's house on Maiden Lane on June 20, 1790. Over a glass of Madeira (at least according to legend), Jefferson, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton struck a historic political deal. Linking the resolution of the nation's outstanding war debts to the location of its capital, the three men worked out a swap. To Hamilton's satisfaction, they federalized the states' debt, thereby setting America on a course of fiscal stability and vigorous economic growth. And to Jefferson and Madison's joy, they removed the United States government from Manhattan (where it had begun operations a year earlier) and sent it southward, first to Philadelphia and ultimately to a new city to be built on the banks of the Potomac.
At the time, many regarded the government's departure as an immeasurable loss for New York. But later historians came to appreciate it as a liberation of sorts, which freed the city to pursue its true vocation -- to become America's commercial, financial and cultural center -- without need for the ponderous ceremonial trappings of an official capital. Unlike the new federal city, the bustling metropolis on the Hudson could follow its own destiny without external encumberment, free always to look forward, not back.
The spatial consequences of this historic schism grew clearer two decades later, when a trio of state-appointed surveyors published their sweeping proposal for the development of Manhattan Island. The Commissioners' Plan of 1811 gave enduring expression not only to New York's remarkable ambition -- its expansive grid of streets providing room for a million people, 10 times that of the existing city -- but even more so to its intense commercial focus. Two thousand rectangular blocks (the most economical and easiest kind to build on, the commissioners noted) would be linked by 12 arrow-straight avenues and 155 parallel streets, speeding the flow of traffic up and down the island and between the rivers. The commissioners deliberately chose not to set aside any special blocks for public buildings or monuments, nor to provide any ceremonial boulevards, grand axes or focal points that might lend themselves to commemorative purposes. In their eyes, nothing should be allowed to interrupt the commercial bustle of the city, the purposeful sweep of vehicles and pedestrians along its streets and sidewalks.
Needless to say, the 1811 plan could not have been more different from the classical grandeur of Europe's capitals, with their imposing array of public edifices. Closer to home -- and more to the point -- the plan stood in the sharpest possible contrast to Pierre Charles L'Enfant's grandiose Baroque layout for Washington, a scheme that carried the instinct for the monumental to extremes, filling the capital city with scores of radial avenues, ceremonial circles, landscaped malls and countless other sites for monuments and memorials of every sort.
In the years to come, the civic character of Washington would come to be defined, to a great degree, by its collection of marble and granite monuments, fountains and sarcophagi. Their dignified, somber presence -- wonderfully successful in creating a revered national shrine -- tended (in the opinion of many) to smother or dilute the urban vitality and excitement of the city itself. Its neighbor to the north, by contrast, never paused for reflection. Far from memorializing the past, New Yorkers seemed intent on erasing every trace of it, ruthlessly destroying their most treasured mementos if they happened to get in the way of progress. 
In the early 1810's, Federal Hall -- the very building in which George Washington had taken the first presidential oath of office and the federal government had set up shop -- turned out to be placed a bit too far into the path of Wall Street's traffic. It was dismantled and sold for scrap. A few decades later, Columbia College decided that its original building on Park Place -- which dated to the institution's earliest years before the Revolutionary War and had managed to survive the terrible conflict -- sat on land too valuable to be reserved for academic use. The trustees sold off the venerable structure, moved uptown and called in the wreckers. And so it went, throughout the 19th century and into the 20th. No touchstone of the past was so precious, so poignant, so meaningful, that it wouldn't be promptly eliminated if it stood in the way of "the future," the city's commercial expansion.
As it came into maturity, to be sure, New York became one of the most monumental cities in the world, especially in terms of its scale. But it was a city whose monumental structures were almost invariably functional in nature: not hollow memorial obelisks like the one in the center of Washington, but towering steel-frame skyscrapers crammed with office workers; not symbolic triumphal arches like that in Paris but soaring suspension bridges carrying floods of traffic and linking the city's boroughs. In New York, as nowhere else, the monumental instinct was put to work and made to pay -- and thus seamlessly integrated with the commercial energy and vitality of the rest of the city.
Of monuments and memorials in the traditional sense, though, very little was erected in New York. What little space was available tended to be a result of a single variation in the Commissioners' Plan: a pre-existing path was preserved, as Broadway, and allowed to meander northward, producing a series of triangular "squares" where the diagonal street intersected the rectilinear grid. These plots, too small to be developed, were often turned over to commemorative purposes, from the tomb of the Mexican War hero Gen. William J. Worth at 25th Street, to the figure of Father Duffy presiding over Times Square, to the statue of Christopher Columbus perched atop Columbus Circle. Respectable artworks, in some cases, but hardly defining elements of the metropolis.
It was revealing that the only New York environments that did become popular for monuments were, in a sense, not in the city at all: the parks. Their original recreational purpose was soon overlaid (to the deep dismay of park designers like Frederick Law Olmsted) with a secondary function as repositories of civic memory, from Grant's Tomb towering over Riverside Park to the modest tablet in Tompkins Square Park recalling the victims of the General Slocum disaster, from the superb Saint-Gaudens figure of Admiral Farragut in Madison Square to countless lesser statues sprinkled through Central, Bryant and Battery Parks.
In a similar manner, New York's greatest monument, a towering iron-and-copper structure of entirely symbolic purpose (created, significantly, not by New Yorkers but by the French, whose instinct for the grand allegorical gesture remains unmatched) was placed in the middle of the harbor, where its classical countenance and figure, rising atop a massive, tomblike Egyptian-style base, would always remain isolated from the ordinary flow of city life. Whether intentionally or not, the greenery of the parks and the waters of the harbor both served to buffer these precincts of memory from the intense, day-to-day energies of the city and, along the way, helped preserve the integrity of each.
Indeed, by the start of the 21st century, after 200 years of urban growth, the division in New York between sacred places of memory and the flow of daily life remained as sharp as ever. A number of memorial pavilions and sculptures (for Irish who died in the famine, Jews who died in the Holocaust, policemen who died in the line of duty) had been added to the new blocks of Battery Park City. But the older blocks of the city still offered few, if any, places where a major site of commemoration directly abutted the bustling streets -- except perhaps Trinity graveyard on lower Broadway, which existed only because the burial ground predated the financial district that rose around it.
And then came Sept. 11 -- a disaster so immense, so searing and so unspeakably tragic that the city's instinctual aversion to the funereal would have to be overcome, and one, furthermore, that would obviously have to be commemorated in situ. Yet as the location and boundaries of the proposed memorial were announced, questions began to be raised -- with the deepest possible respect -- about how the isolated seven-acre site would affect efforts to restore the urban vitality of the area. In particular, how would it affect the attempt to establish a dense and lively network of streets, to reweave the surrounding communities to each other and to Battery Park City?
Beyond these immediate issues could be heard the echoes of a deep and ancient antipathy. Its resolution -- if indeed it is resolved -- will represent a significant step in the evolution of the city, as New York, for so long dedicated to life and energy and worldly pursuits, at last accepts and even embraces the mortal, the otherworldly, and the eternal.

HEADLINE: THE NEW GROUND ZERO; 
The Downtown Culture Derby Begins . . .

BYLINE:  By PHILIP NOBEL; Philip Nobel is writing a book on the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site.

 BODY:
IN two years of roiling debates over the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site, one of the most durable assumptions has been that space should be set aside for those varied pursuits collectively known as "culture." We are still far from knowing which museums or symphonies or purveyors of public art will find a home there, but early indications suggest that the 670,000 square feet allotted for the arts may be a new front in the battle over ground zero's future.
 This much is certain: institutions that take the dare and locate themselves at that haunted, contested place will find that a lot more is asked of them than the usual dose of edification and diversion. 
 The stage on which the dramas will play out, Daniel Libeskind's working master plan for the development, includes one prime site designated for a performing arts center and another, the focal point of the scheme, that is intended for a museum. Two long buildings that abut the museum may house smaller institutions or could be combined with it. Outdoor performances and installations could occupy three new public plazas, one of which serves as the gateway to the memorial. Even without the outdoor areas, the enclosed spaces will have a higher total of square footage than the Museum of Modern Art after its expansion is completed in 2005. 
The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation -- the state-controlled, federally financed body that counts among its goals the transformation of the area into a "mixed-use magnet for the arts" -- is now soliciting proposals from cultural organizations interested in moving to the site. No decisions are expected until at least early 2004. For well over a year, the performing arts center was assumed to be the future home of the New York City Opera. In the last few weeks, however, that consensus has collapsed. The development corporation appears to have backed away from the idea, claiming that the space would be too small to accommodate an opera house. (Mr. Libeskind, along with city officials, disagrees.) Just last week, the 92nd Street Y confirmed that it was developing plans for an expansion into ground zero, possibly in conjunction with the Joyce Theater, the TriBeCa Film Festival, Hunter College -- and City Opera.
As for the museum, a cut-glass geode hovering enigmatically over the area set aside for a memorial, many options have been suggested. The L.M.D.C. has described it, in bureaucratese, as a "museum relating events of 9/11 into historical context." Last year Mr. Libeskind was calling it the Museum at the Edge of Hope. But the lead suitor for that pivotal space, then as now, is a nascent institution with a name that, subject to your take on the national political scene, will be either fortifying or unnerving: the Museum of Freedom.
Whatever the eventual anchor tenants may be, the stakes are high for culture at ground zero. The museum will shape the way visitors interpret the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. And the performing arts center is being conceived as a central component in the revitalization of Lower Manhattan, a cultural nexus that will consolidate what has been referred to as downtown's "kingdom of minor museums" into a major engine of economic recovery.
Even Rudolph Giuliani has argued that appropriate cultural uses are the key to a comeback at ground zero. But emphasis on culture-as-commerce will be less popular with groups like the Coalition of 9/11 Families. Each of the two long wings that extend, Louvre-like, from Mr. Libeskind's museum also crosses one of the footprints of the fallen towers, spaces that the coalition wants preserved "from bedrock to infinity."
So far, however, the most vocal debate surrounding the future arts complex has been about its possible audience. In a flat economy, are there enough culture consumers to fill such a huge new space? Will they journey so far from Manhattan's Carnegie Hall-Lincoln Center-Museum Mile arts belt? "There is a certain arrogance in the Manhattan psyche," says Karen Brooks Hopkins, president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, "that limits the cultural life of New York City to 10 square blocks of Midtown."
The area around ground zero is home to several constituencies, each making distinct demands. Tourists on the American heritage trail may seek out this new pilgrimage site after visits to Ellis and Liberty Islands. Residents of the surrounding neighborhoods (who list entertainment and culture at the top of their redevelopment wish lists) are, according to Madelyn Wils, chairwoman of Community Board 1, more interested in "something to take your family to over and over" than in a "9/11 museum you go to once."
Those two uses may not be at odds. The development corporation estimates the memorial could draw up to 10 million visitors a year. Even if their tastes skew toward the mainstream, their spending power could benefit the edgiest local art geeks. "If the Museum of Freedom generates a lot of revenue and can support an outdoor performance venue, bravo!" said Liz Thompson, executive director of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council.
As John Whitehead, chairman of the L.M.D.C., points out, even opera could find a walk-in crowd in that crush. "The downtown kind of space will appeal to a different audience," he said. "No one just walks by the Metropolitan Opera and says, 'Gee, I'd like to see an opera today.' If we have 25,000 visitors a day, that becomes realistic."
EARLIER this summer, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation issued the Invitation to Cultural Institutions, a kind of open casting call to groups large and small. Interested parties have until Sept. 15 to submit a short proposal outlining how they would use space at ground zero, as well as how their project could support itself. "It's a call for concepts," says Kevin Rampe, president of the L.M.D.C. "We want to be overwhelmed by the ideas."
It seems likely that they will be. On July 28, the corporation convened a forum at Pace University to explain the new initiative. Representatives from 180 organizations attended, including New York culture stalwarts like the City Center and the American Museum of Natural History, left-of-the-dial concerns like the Knitting Factory and Mabou Mines, and curiosities like the Czechoslovak-American Marionette Theater.
One goal of this open invitation is to honor the fairness-in-bidding rules associated with the disbursal of federal funds, of which Mr. Rampe said between $200 million and $250 million might eventually be spent. But more generally, it is an effort to democratize a process that had previously played out in private discussions between major institutions and the L.M.D.C.
Last year, for instance, Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, met with Mr. Whitehead to discuss an idea the latter was promoting at the time: the creation of a space at ground zero for rotating displays of art from the city's top museums. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Museum said the director was "amenable" to this idea, but added that there were no continuing discussions; the museum is not planning to respond to the open call for proposals.
Spokespeople for the Guggenheim Museum and the Museum of Modern Art confirmed that they, too, were passing on the invitation, though the Modern did send a staffer to "check out" the July 28 meeting. Major local institutions still planning to submit ideas include the New-York Historical Society and the Museum of the City of New York, both of which have extensive collections of material -- impromptu shrines, carefully conserved walls of "missing" posters -- of the sort that might suit a ground zero museum. 
But for any institution or coalition that might make a bid for some of the planned 180,000 square feet of museum space, one competitor looms large. "The Museum of Freedom concept is very much alive," Mr. Whitehead said. "We don't want to give anyone the idea that they have a lock on it. But it is being considered."
As it has been from the very beginning. The Preliminary Blueprint for the Future of Lower Manhattan -- a document released in April 2002 that was the first public summary of the L.M.D.C.'s plans -- discussed the creation of a Freedom Park that might include "a new museum dedicated to American freedom, tolerance and the values that the World Trade Center represented." Elsewhere, the document mentions the construction of "a museum of freedom and remembrance." Mr. Rampe denied that these descriptions referred to a specific museum. But Tom A. Bernstein, the leader of the Museum of Freedom project, said he had proposed his idea in a letter to the development corporation the month before the blueprint was released.
Further tilting the culturescape in the museum's direction, American Express earlier this year announced that it would help sponsor the project. The company is already providing what a spokeswoman described as "seed grants to develop the idea." In the context of a dire economic environment for the arts, it is not hard to see why a museum with a populist message and bright fiscal prospects might gain an early lead.
It has also drawn early fire from critics, most reacting to little more than the riddle of its name. Edwin Schlossberg, a designer who has just begun work as part of a team retooling the visitor's center at the Statue of Liberty, hails the message but questions the medium. "A monument to freedom, or liberty, or American ideals is exactly what should be there," he said. "But not a museum."
Others worry that the treatment of the idea will be simplistic -- "the 9/11 story has a complicated relationship to the idea of freedom," one local museum administrator said -- or that a term as loosely defined as "freedom" could be put to ideological ends. 
Here the Museum of Freedom may be a victim of its context.Ground zero is itself highly charged political terrain, and may become even more so: in May, Larry A. Silverstein, the primary leaseholder for the World Trade Center, told The Daily News that groundbreaking for the site's signature tower is being timed to coincide with the Republican National Convention in Manhattan next summer. His office later denied the report.
But those hoping to find in the proposed museum a rallying cry for partisan politics or a fulcrum for dissent may be disappointed. Mr. Bernstein seems less like an ideologue than an entrepreneur and an optimist. Best known as the cofounder of Chelsea Piers, the recreational complex on the Hudson River, he was also the executive vice president of Silver Screen Partners and an investor in the Texas Rangers. (George W. Bush, a close friend of Roland Betts, Mr. Bernstein's partner at Chelsea Piers, was a director of Silver Screen and an owner of the Rangers). But he began his career as a lawyer, devoting some of his pro bono time to political asylum cases, which he cites as the inspiration for this project.
The revelation, he said, was the contrast between the environment in the nations his clients were fleeing -- Ferdinand Marcos's Philippines, for example -- and what he called "the noble American experiment of a free and open society." He likes to use the phrase "warts and all" when describing that experiment, and he said the museum would take an "unvarnished" look at freedom's failures, like slavery and the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. "We've got to aspire to our ideals," he said. "And we've made an awful lot of mistakes."
Recently Mr. Bernstein tapped Michael H. Posner, the executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, to serve on a growing team of consultants. For those who fear that the Museum of Freedom might be a shaky bulwark in defense of civil liberties, Mr. Posner should be a reassuring presence: his group helped write three amicus briefs on behalf of Jose Padilla, the American "dirty bomb" suspect who is being held as an enemy combatant. The briefs argued, Mr. Posner said, in favor of "erring on the side of the Constitution."
Last month, with Mr. Posner, Mr. Bernstein led the museum's consultants to the annual meeting of the International Coalition of Historic Site Museums of Conscience -- a group that includes a museum to honor the disappeared in Argentina, a museum to honor victims of the Gulag in Russia, a museum at a Holocaust site in the Czech Republic and the Slave House in Senegal.
Liz Sevcenko, the coalition coordinator, characterized the group's reaction to the Museum of Freedom concept as a split decision. "The folks from the Czech Republic and Russia were saying, 'No way, this was an attack on freedom everywhere,' " she recalled. "The South Americans and Africans were saying, 'We had your backs for the first couple of months, but . . .' "
Even an uncontroversial museum, or a performing arts complex with something to please everyone, will face a difficult challenge at ground zero, poised between a million square feet of retail space and a nearly five-acre memorial precinct, charged with respecting the dead while bringing life to adjacent shopping streets. For the Museum of Freedom, should it be selected, things could be even trickier.
Somehow, despite their big money, big entertainment, big cafes-and-gift-shops reality, big cultural institutions have been given a pass to operate at ground zero in a mode that many thought was lost: as fonts of enlightenment, zones of transcendence, civic temples. Why else would they be allowed to perch just so on the edge of the Pit? How else could they be used as a buffer between the sacred and the profane?
Mr. Libeskind, for one, still speaks of culture's aura. "I think that the power of culture is: no matter how much money you have, no matter how much power you have, life is about other things," he said. "Life is about other things."

HEADLINE: Memories Are Priceless 

BYLINE:  By QUANG BAO; QUANG BAO is executive director of the Asia America Writers' Workshop.

 BODY:
MY father and I boarded the plane for Vietnam, carrying $15,000 in cash to give away to relatives. We were making our first trip back home four years ago, after nearly three decades in the United States. We purposely scheduled our trip to coincide with the lunar New Year, and we thought nothing could be a better augur for better times ahead than two long-lost family members showing up unexpectedly at the doorstep bearing gifts. 
 We hid money in suitcases, tucked it into pockets my mother sewed on the underside of our shirts and stuffed it inside socks and underwear. My father had saved money for this trip from his job managing a convenience store, and we were also carrying money and parcels from friends and relatives in the United States who wanted us to deliver the gifts to their families in Vietnam. During the 18-hour flight from Los Angeles to Taipei to Ho Chi Minh City, I pictured myself running from the airport straight to the bank and trying to deposit my entire self into a vault, while a young boy chased me, throwing rocks, until I detonated, all our money flying into the air like chicken feathers. 
 Though Saigon became Ho Chi Minh City in 1975, when we landed at the airport, our driver held a placard that read "Welcome to Saigon," with my last name first, the way it always will be written in Vietnam. The sign became my only real souvenir.
 The driver took the tourist route to our hotel, near the Ben Thanh Market. Looking out from the van, my father appeared excited. He left in 1975, when he was 46 years old, on a boat; my mother, siblings and I were waiting for him in a refugee camp in California.
 His city had changed. "That's where Pho Hoa used to be," the driver would say, mentioning a famous noodle shop, and then we looked out at the opulent New World Hotel, opened in 1994 when Ho Chi Minh City was still poised to become the economic tiger of the Pacific Rim. 
 "Take us to the bank!" my father yelled.
 The driver stopped at a gift shop where currency could be exchanged. It was on Dong Khoi Street, with ice cream parlors, upscale restaurants and art galleries. "He gets a commission," my father whispered. 
 In the back of the van, we bundled the money into a bag. There was no line in the shop but a lot of yelling behind the counter, as if everyone were gambling to win one of the lacquered landscape tableaus, jade bonsais or smiling Buddhas. When the transaction was nearly complete, we realized our problem -- a dollar equaled about 15,000 Vietnamese dong. The young girl stacked enormous piles of bills on the counter. We had no way to assess whether we received a fair rate of exchange, and they had no appropriately sized bags to give us. 
 For four weeks, we traveled all around Vietnam in cyclos, cabs, trains and airplanes, creatively hiding our diminishing supply of gift money. We went round trip from Ho Chi Minh City, a bustling metropolis of commerce, up to the rainy region of Hue with its royal palaces and legendary 19th-century architecture, and toward Hanoi, the beautiful capital city dotted with museums and historic sites. Throughout, we gave away the money in the same manner. The 11 designated recipients, close members of my immediate family, grew to include cousins, children and neighbors. They were poor and didn't have jobs or schooling, and I gave many of them the money my father had given me to distribute. We would take a cab to someone's home because my father wanted the ease and security, though I felt odd being frightened of Vietnamese people. Once invited inside, we were offered black tea, mangosteens, or butter cookies. We emptied a suitcase, containing an envelope of money but also clothing, soaps, pain medication, underwear and other items that we had brought from the United States. We took pictures. 
 And the recipients would write a note of gratitude for us to carry back to family in the United States. 
 With so much cash, it was hard not to be lavish. I bought a round of beers at Apocalypse Now in Hanoi for an entire busload of Vietnamese Canadians, a drawing for myself of Can Tho, a city on the Mekong Delta where I was born, and bags of fruit and sour candies from the open markets, giving the bags away randomly. I also tipped anywhere from 20 to 500 percent. My father had a false tooth redone. We traveled first class. We splurged on a few meals. And still, we had a lot of money to spare.
 The stories of suffering that my extended family experienced after the war in Vietnam triggered my American sense of philanthropy: I handed over money to anyone who looked as if they needed it. But near the end of the trip, I started to feel manipulated. When the vendor at the sugar-cane stall repeated her war story to me, she had two sisters who drowned off a refugee boat and not just one as in the original telling.
After my aunt's husband was killed and Saigon fell, my aunt lived literally in the jungle and worked jobs she'd rather forget. She now was in line to emigrate to the United States but she wasn't sure if she wanted to die in a strange country. Oh, and did we have $500 to bribe the officer who was handling her papers so that she could be put ahead in the line? 
 In Vietnam, the cats are extremely skinny, people sleep on the zoo grounds, and I kept dreaming they were all me. Rather, I could have been the one left behind, uneducated and rotten-toothed. At the end of the war, everyone in the south was made instantly poor. Those who fled successfully became the rich Western cousin, friend or uncle to whom they would write their appeals for money. We are called Viet kieus, the overseas Vietnamese. A Viet kieu can find money anywhere in his house, couch or many cars so why couldn't I pay the minuscule entrance fee for a group of six to get into a Saigon disco? It was hard to fault the rationale, but my emotions had nothing to do with the amount of money in question. 
 I was born in Vietnam but I remember almost nothing about it. In returning, I yearned for a clearer picture of a place I had been trying to imagine for so long. At the end of the trip I only felt an overwhelming sense of loss and guilt, not the connections I was searching for. My father felt exhausted, and he realized that the poverty was too extreme to truly help the few people he tried to aid. We still had some dong when we returned to the United States. On our final day, my father put his hand out to stop me from tipping the bellboy who loaded our cab to the airport. "Don't get their hopes up," he said.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; 
San Francisco's Woes A Boon for Visitors

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
FOR the hotel industry in San Francisco, things have rarely been so bleak. But for travelers looking for a hotel bargain in a city that is often ranked in polls as America's favorite urban destination, there may never be a better time to visit.
 Battered by chronic low occupancy that began with the collapse of the dot-com economy in 2000 and that continued in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks and the Iraq war, many of the city's boutique hotels now routinely offer rates of $100 a night or less for a double room, before taxes. 
 According to PKF Consulting, a firm that measures travel trends, the city's average hotel occupancy went from 81.7 percent in 2000 to 65.4 percent last year. In May of this year, the most recent month for which figures are available, occupancy was at 68.1 percent, compared with 84.1 percent in May 2000. The firm's figures show that the city's average daily room rate last year was $146, compared with $170 in 2000, a drop of 14 percent. 
 Several major luxury hotels around Union Square, in the heart of the city's shopping and theater districts, have offered promotional rates this summer from $110 to $125 a night for a double room, about half what many were charging in the boom years at the end of the 1990's.
 The collapse in hotel rates has pushed down overall travel costs in San Francisco, long at the top of lists of the most expensive American cities to visit. 
 "These are the lowest rates that we've seen since we went into business in 1986," said Eric Gustavson, a partner in Topaz Hotel Services, which runs a popular Web site (www.hotelres.com) that specializes in discount rates at major hotels in San Francisco and the Bay Area. "I wouldn't call this desperation by the hotels. But there's a realism that's set in. Hotels are doing their best to offer the absolute best values that they can."
 Examples abound on his Web site for travel this fall, including the Westin St. Francis on Union Square at $129 a night, the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf and Donatello at $109. (All these rates are for double rooms, before taxes, which add 14 percent to the bill.) The site also lists discount rates at some of the city's legendary luxury hotels atop Nob Hill, including the Fairmont at $189 and the Huntington at $185; the Huntington's Web site (www.huntingtonhotel.com) shows that its regular, nondiscounted rate is $315 a night for a double room.
 Mr. Gustavson said his best bargain may be the King George Hotel, a newly renovated boutique hotel one block from Union Square and the Powell Street cable-car line, with rates beginning at $65 a night; the usual undiscounted rates start at $145. The newly opened Hotel Cosmo off Union Square is offering rates beginning at $85 a night this fall. 
 Similar budget rates are found at the other major travel sites, including Expedia, Orbitz and Travelocity.
 Times are so tough in the city's hotel market that Ian Schrager's latest temple of chic, the renovated Clift Hotel, his first outpostin San Francisco, declared bankruptcy this month. The hotel says it will continue to operate as normal, however, and has been offering rates this fall beginning at $195 a night through the hotelres.com Web site, well below the rates charged at the Clift's sister hotels in New York, Los Angeles and Miami.
 The drop in hotel rates corresponds to the precipitous drop in occupancy that began in the spring of 2000, when technology stocks first started to turn sour, which quickly drove out investment capital, forcing many of the city's high-technology start-up companies out of business.
 San Francisco's hotels had hoped for a big turnaround this year, especially with signs of a national economic recovery, but then came SARS in Asia, which kept away many of the city's high-spending visitors from across the Pacific, and the war in Iraq.
 "It's ironic, given our name, but there hasn't been a lot of joy of life recently in operating this business," said Chip Conley, the founder and chief executive of Joie de Vivre Hospitality, which operates 25 boutique hotels in California, 17 of them in San Francisco. But, he added, "Things are starting to look up, the markets are starting to improve." He noted that the newly opened expansion of the Moscone convention center would draw many new visitors to the city this fall. 
 Amid the downturn, Mr. Conley and his company have continued to open new hotels, including one this summer, the Adagio, a 171-room luxury hotel near Union Square with two-line cordless phones in every room, along with free high-speed Internet access, CD players and a modern fitness center. 
 In the late 1990's, Mr. Conley said, the rates for such a hotel would have begun at $169 to $179. But given the state of the travel industry here, the rates at the Adagio start at $119. "San Francisco is an absolute bargain," Mr. Conley said.

HEADLINE: How to Talk About Israel 

BYLINE:  By Ian Buruma; Ian Buruma lives in Oxford and New York. He is a Luce Professor at Bard College and the author, most recently, of "Inventing Japan."

 BODY:
The Jewish Problem pops up in the strangest places. In the winter of 1991, at the height of the first gulf war, I asked a right-wing Japanese politician who still wields considerable power in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to explain the Japanese role in the Middle Eastern conflict. After clearing his throat with some perfunctory remarks about oil supplies and United States-Japan relations, he suddenly stopped midsentence, gave me a shrewd look and said: "Look, we Japanese aren't stupid. We saw Henry Kissinger on TV. We know how America operates. We're perfectly well aware that this war is not about Kuwait. It's about Jewish interests. It's all about Israel."
 Perhaps he had read too many books about Jewish conspiracies (Roosevelt was a Jew, Churchill was a Jew, Rockefeller was a Jew, etc.), for which the Japanese market seems to have an insatiable appetite. He was, in any case, not known for his intellectual finesse. But the idea that Israel or Jewish interests are somehow at the center of world events or, at the very least, at the center of American foreign policy in the Middle East is widely held, and not only outside the United States. No matter what the current American administration does to save the tattered "road map" toward an end to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, sinister motives are still bound to be imputed. 
 Earlier this year, Representative James Moran, a Democrat, said that "if it were not for the strong support of the Jewish community for this war with Iraq, we would not be doing this." In Britain, Tam Dalyell, a longstanding Labor member of Parliament, expressed a similar view. Tony Blair, he opined, was listening too much to a "cabal" of Jews around President Bush that included Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz; an under secretary of defense, Douglas Feith; Richard Perle, a member of the Defense Policy Board; Elliott Abrams, director of Middle East Affairs in the White House; and the former presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer. "Those people drive this policy," Dalyell said.
Dalyell was "worried about my country being led up the garden path on a Likudnik-Sharon agenda" by British Jews close to Blair. He included among them Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, a Christian, whose rather distant Jewish family connections are very unlikely to make him a Likudnik. 
The fact that James Moran had to apologize immediately, while the British M.P. was under no compulsion to do so, shows a profound difference between the United States and Europe, or indeed anywhere else in the world. Although Moran's opinion may be shared by other Americans, it is not something mainstream politicians can vocalize. Even legitimate criticism of Israel, or of Zionism, is often quickly denounced as anti-Semitism by various watchdogs. In European political discourse, not only is anti-Zionism quite acceptable, but so are vague allegations of too much Jewish influence in public life, especially across the Atlantic. And in the non-Western world, it's not even necessary to keep such allegations vague.
Rarely can such a tiny country as Israel, and such a relatively small minority as the diaspora Jews, have been assumed to exercise so much influence in world affairs. The special relationship between Israel and the United States, and the supposed dominance of "Jewish interests" in Washington, is by now encrusted with so many layers of mythology and bad faith that it has become very difficult to discuss Israel's role in American politics critically and dispassionately. Yet not to talk about it invites only more conspiracy theories. 
There are several myths to be considered. The first is the idea that the American or the British government is dominated or manipulated by Jews. In fact, none of President Bush's cabinet members are Jewish, and the last time individual Jews played a prominent part in any British government was under John Major. Straw, moreover, has spent more time and energy courting Iran than Israel. The well-being of Israel is not Blair's main concern either. In fact, an equitable deal for the Palestinians is more important to the British leader, who badly needs to rebuild his bridges with other European governments. That is why he wants Washington to push the Israelis harder to make peace with the Palestinians. 
There is no doubt that Israeli lobby groups are well organized and well financed and have considerable clout in Washington. But then so do other lobbies. That is how the game is played. There was a time not so long ago when hefty books were written about the United States government falling into the hands of scheming Japanese lobbies. It is true that some people in the Pentagon, as well as influential organizations like the American Enterprise Institute and the Project for the New American Century, have close relations with the Likud Party, and especially with Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is much more in tune with American neoconservatism than Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is. Douglas Feith and Richard Perle advised Netanyahu, who was prime minister in 1996, to make "a clean break" from the Oslo accords with the Palestinians. They also argued that Israeli security would be served best by regime change in surrounding countries. Despite the current mess in Iraq, this is still a commonplace in Washington. In Paul Wolfowitz's words, "The road to peace in the Middle East goes through Baghdad." It has indeed become an article of faith (literally in some cases) in Washington that American and Israeli interests are identical, but this was not always so, and "Jewish interests" are not the main reason for it now. 
Indeed, Israel enjoys a zealous following among some gentiles, particularly Christian fundamentalists. (In electoral terms, Christian fundamentalists are more important to the Republican Party than Jews -- there are many more of them, the Christian Coalition is highly efficient and most Jews still vote for the Democrats anyway.) Even though Israel is often described as the only democracy in the Middle East, the Christian right's remarkable devotion to Israel is not necessarily driven by democratic principles. The "Christian Zionists" are convinced by a literal reading of the Bible that Christ will reappear only once the Jews have repossessed the Holy Land. Their other conviction, that Jews will either die in an apocalypse or be converted to Christianity, is not so reassuring. Still, the Rev. Jerry Falwell declared on "60 Minutes" that evangelical Christians would make sure no American president would ever do anything to harm Israel. At a conference of the Christian Coalition held in Washington last year, there were more Stars of David than crucifixes. 
Then there are the foreign-policy hawks for whom Israel has been a strategic inspiration. The notions of "pre-emptive" war and "regime change" were exemplified, if not exactly pioneered, by Israel. The Six-Day War of 1967 was launched by Israel in self-protection, admittedly in the face of far greater provocation than Iraq ever gave the United States. And the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 was part of an Israeli effort to install a more friendly government in Beirut. Both actions, deplored by critics of Israel all over the world, were seen as marks of admirable resolve by friends of Israel in the United States.
What we see, then, is not a Jewish conspiracy, but a peculiar alliance of evangelical Christians, foreign-policy hard-liners, lobbyists for the Israeli government and neoconservatives, a number of whom happen to be Jewish. But the Jews among them -- Perle, Wolfowitz, William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, et al. -- are more likely to speak about freedom and democracy than about Halakha (Jewish law). What unites this alliance of convenience is a shared vision of American destiny andthe conviction that American force and a tough Israeli line on the Arabs are the best ways to make the United States strong, Israel safe and the world a better place. 
Not all Americans agree with this hard line, to be sure: a recent campaign by American Jews to press Sharon into accepting a two-state solution shows this. In fact, he now accepts it in principle. Whether he will comply with American pressure to stop building a barrier to keep the Palestinians more or less imprisoned inside the occupied territories is doubtful, especially when Palestinian suicide bombers continue to blow up buses -- and the Israeli government continues to kill Hamas leaders. And there is no sign that President Bush will make a serious effort to make the Israelis dismantle, or at least stop building, Jewish settlements in the Palestinian areas. The idea that Israeli and American interests, as defined by evangelical Christians, neocons and Likudniks, converge, as if by force of nature, is not seriously challenged in the United States. 
To judge from much of the world's media, especially in Europe and the Middle East, this was always true. In fact, it was not. The turning point was the Six-Day War. It was then that many Europeans took up the Palestinian cause and Israel could count, for the first time, on the almost unconditional support of the United States. In 1947, President Harry S. Truman did join the Soviet Union in backing the United Nations resolution that gave Jews the right to found a state in Palestine. But he did so against the advice of State Department officials, who worried about antagonizing the oil-rich Arab nations. When Israelis fought for the survival of their state in 1948, the United States did nothing to help them. Both the Americans and the Soviets would later have good reasons for discretion about their respective attitudes at Israel's difficult birth. 
In 1956, during the Suez crisis, the United States actively opposed Israel's interests. It was an interesting little war in light of today's fashionable cliches about dovish anti-Zionist Europeans and hawkish pro-Israeli Americans. Israel's biggest supporter and arms supplier in the 1950's was not the United States, but France. That is how Israel got its nuclear bomb. Britain was more ambivalent and tended to lean toward the Arabs. But when President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, often depicted in the European press as an Arab Hitler, nationalized the Suez Canal, thus cutting out the British and French corporate owners, the British joined the French in an attempt to grab it back. They enlisted the Israelis in this enterprise by encouraging them to attack Egyptian "terrorists" in the Sinai, after which Britain and France would order both sides to withdraw from Suez. The inevitable Egyptian refusal would then be followed by a short, sharp conflict and possibly even a "regime change" in Cairo. All went well until the Soviets threatened to intervene on behalf of the Egyptians and President Dwight D. Eisenhower forced France and Britain to back off and the Israelis to get out of the Sinai. 
The French remained Israel's staunchest allies until 1967, when Gen. Charles de Gaulle decided to withdraw his favors. Having only just divested France of its last colonial possessions in North Africa, de Gaulle decided to cultivate the Arabs. He called the Israelis a "domineering" people and warned them against going to war. As he put it to the Israeli foreign minister, Abba Eban: "You will be considered the aggressor by the world, and by me. You will cause the Soviet Union to penetrate more deeply into the Middle East, and Israel will suffer the consequences. You will create a Palestinian nationalism, and you will never get rid of it." De Gaulle was not totally wrong on any of these counts.
Until 1967, Israel was a great liberal European cause. Almost everyone on the left supported it. The promised land of kibbutzim and open-shirted pioneers represented, after all, a socialist dream. Conservatives supported Israel, too, especially the type of people who thought that Jews were all very well as long as they stuck to their own kind. This attitude was not new. Arthur Balfour, the British foreign secretary whose famous declaration in 1917 opened Palestine to Jewish immigration, was against Jewish immigration to Britain and told Chaim Weizmann, the Zionist leader, that he shared the "anti-Semitic postulates" of certain well-known Jew-baiters. 
Guilt, too, had a great deal to do with European good will toward Israel in the 50's and early 60's. This was a time when Jewish characters in German novels took on a saintly air and anti-Semitic remarks (in public) were treated as a kind of blasphemy. Anti-Semitism didn't disappear, of course, but open expressions of it were frowned upon, at least in Western Europe. If the word "Jew" had to be uttered at all, people lowered their voices, as if embarrassed by the very sound of it. Britain, never having been under Nazi occupation, was less vexed. Having grown up in guilt-ridden Holland, I can remember how shocked I was, sometime in the mid-60's, to hear a young lawyer in London make disparaging remarks about Jews.
Philo-Semitism is better than pogroms, to be sure, but there was something unreal, and even a little unsettling, about this dutiful sense of collective guilt. It was as if Jews, including Israeli Jews, once again were not treated in the same way as other human beings, which can quickly lead to resentment, not among Jews so much as among gentiles. Zvi Rex, an Israeli psychoanalyst, once put his finger right on this sorest of points. "The Germans," he said, "will never forgive the Jews for Auschwitz." This harsh analysis applies to some extent to non-Jews all over the European continent. Nobody likes to be made to feel guilty, especially for the sins of his father. 
So it was with a certain sense of relief, in the aftermath of the 1967 war, that the European left, led by Communist publications like L'Humanite in France, could point its finger at Israelis and conclude that Jews, far from being saintly, were behaving just as badly as everyone else and, indeed, perhaps worse. Once it became clear that the Israelis were not going to give back their conquered territories, the Palestinians became the prime victims to be protected from persecution, and the Jews became the Nazis. Here is L'Humanite on July 20, 1967: "Six million Jews were not slaughtered by the Nazis so that young sabras could on occasion behave like young Hitlerites."
In fact, Europeans, especially on the left, had a double guilt complex. One complex concerned the widespread collaboration in the destruction of European Jewry; the other was about the colonial past. France's war in Algeria ended only in 1962, after eight years of torture, terrorism and a near civil war in France. Israel had backed France in this last stand for European colonial rule. Taking up the cause of Palestinians, Vietnamese and other postcolonial peoples fighting for their "liberation" was a way to atone for past European sins. And because Western imperialism, since the late 60's, was largely associated with Israel and the United States, anti-Zionism and anti-Americanism came to mean the same thing. In this respect, if in little else, the editors of L'Humanite and General de Gaulle were entirely on the same wavelength.
The United States, meanwhile, began supplying Israel with fighter jets in 1968 and became an ever more reliable friend. But Zionist lobbies were not the main reason. It was the politics of the cold war that paved Washington's road to Jerusalem. Even though President Lyndon Johnson liked the macho Israelis, some of his closest advisers, including Vietnam hawks like Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Walt Rostow, a national security adviser, argued against supporting Israel's 1967 war. But Johnson decided that the United States had to stand by Israel to thwart Soviet designs on the Middle East. 
If American Jews had anything to do with this, it was because many of them criticized the war in Vietnam, and Johnson needed something to appease these loyal Democratic voters. Since Israel, by then, was becoming a primary focus of Jewish identification -- as religion, Yiddish and other Old World memories were fading -- American support for Israel was a popular move among Jews. And besides that, Israel was not only more democratic than America's client states in Southeast Asia but a much brighter military success to boot. 
The steady alignment of American interests with Israel made it possible for American Jews to be good Jews, good Democrats and good American patriots too. This same period gave birth to neoconservatism, in which Israel played a major role. The career of Norman Podhoretz might serve as an illustration. He was once a man of the left who wondered, when "thinking about the Jews," whether "their survival as a distinct group was worth one hair on the head of a single infant." But, as he explained in a speech on the occasion of his retirement as editor of Commentary in 1995, he began to change his mind in the 60's, when he became "much more aggressive in defense of Jewish interests in general and of Israel in particular." One reason was a sense of shock when defeat in Vietnam threatened to turn the United States into a demoralized, enervated, even isolationist power, which would no longer stand up for good against evil in the world. 
The other came roughly at the same time. Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories made radical leftists in the United States as receptive as Europeans to Arab and Soviet depictions of the Zionists as neo-Nazis. Disgust with this kind of "liberalism," as well as with a perception of American weakness, pushed former leftists, like Podhoretz and Irving Kristol, managing editor of Commentary, to the right. Convinced of "the inextricable connection between the survival of Israel and American military strength," Podhoretz began to see American dovishness in foreign affairs as a direct threat to Israeli survival. This feeling may be shared by some European Jews too, but without the swagger that goes with being a superpower citizen. Ruth Wisse, a professor of Yiddish literature at Harvard, remarked about Podhoretz that "because of the national confidence that America nurtured in him, he is immune to the self-doubt and apologetics that eat up so many of his co-religionists from inside."
This confidence is what Podhoretz and other neoconservatives sought to save from the wreckage of Vietnam. One of their most powerful political allies in this enterprise was Senator Henry (Scoop) Jackson, mentor of Richard Perle, among others. Jackson, a gentile, a Democrat and a staunch cold warrior, was the perfect bridge on which former leftists could cross over to the right, without actually joining the Republican Party. Henry Jackson was a founder of the America-Israel Friendship League. Israel, to him, was not a sentimental issue but an essential part of his vision of the United States as a nation destined to free the world from tyranny. Arab nationalism and Soviet Communism were seen as equally dangerous in this rather Manichaean view of a worldwide battle between good and evil. 
It goes with Manichaeism (which is, of course, what appeals to Christian fundamentalists too) that battles are not only strategic but also existential. And this, in the eyes of many neocons, is what puts Israel and the United States in the same boat. Podhoretz again: "Just as the fervent wish of the Arab world to wipe the Jewish state off the map derives not from anything Israel has done or failed to do, but rather from its existence alone, so we" -- the United States -- "are hated not because of our policies but because of who and what we are."
The roots of neoconservative disillusion with liberalism and the almost obsessive promotion of American power go deeper than Vietnam, however. In Podhoretz's case it goes back to his childhood experiences on a school playground in Brooklyn, where he was bullied by his black schoolmates. Blacks, he had always been told, in good liberal fashion, were poor and persecuted, while Jews were rich and powerful. Neither rich, nor powerful, young Norman grew to hate the boys that beat him up with such ease. As he explained in a famous essay, "My Negro Problem -- and Ours," he hated them, but also admired them, for "they were tough; beautifully, enviably tough, not giving a damn for anyone or anything. To hell with the teacher, the truant officer, the cop; to hell with the whole of the adult world that held us in its grip and that we never had the courage to rebel against."
This is highly revealing. What Henry Jackson, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Ariel Sharon, Benjamin Netanyahu and George W. Bush have in common is that they enabled bookish men to feel tough, beautifully, enviably tough. Too much can be made of the connection between the Chicago philosopher Leo Strauss and officials in the current Pentagon, but one aspect of Strauss appears to have rubbed off on them. Born in Germany, Strauss was a liberal rationalist in his youth. He had hoped, he said, that anti-Semitism would end with Jewish assimilation in a liberal democracy. The Nazis taught him otherwise. By the 1920's he began to regard liberals as weaklings, powerless to stop the violent mob. If one thing ties neoconservatives, Likudniks, and post-cold-war hawks together, it is the conviction that liberalism is strictly for sissies. 
By the time Israel was attacked by Egypt and Syria in October 1973, it could no longer be doubted which side the United States stood on, but the size of American largess increased enormously. Before the Yom Kippur War, Congress agreed to an annual loan to Israel of more than $500 million. After the war, this was increased to $2.1 billion in loans and grants, much of which went into purchasing American military hardware. Again, the influence of Jewish lobbies can be easily exaggerated. President Nixon was not known for his warm feelings toward Jews, and most Jews did not vote for him, but he saw Israel as a vital pawn in the great game with the Soviets, especially when they were supplying Egypt with arms. 
Once Egypt made peace with Israel in 1979, and switched patrons from Moscow to Washington, challenging the Soviets was no longer a major American concern. But the revolution in Iran, led by Ayatollah Khomeini, produced another enemy to confront. And this new confrontation outlasted the cold war. For Khomeini's brand of revolutionary Islam inspired others. Among the Palestinians, who had always been relatively secular, Islamist extremism gradually merged with Palestinian nationalism. The intifadas began with throwing stones, but degenerated into suicide attacks on Israeli citizens, organized by Palestinians with support from parts of the Arab world. Seen from a particular perspective in America, then, especially after 9/11, Israel and the United States, bound together by cold-war concerns in the 60's and 70's, were now thrown together in an existential "war against terrorism." This shaped a climate in which it is not just potentially anti-Semitic to be critical of Israeli policies, but downright unpatriotic, too.
If political perspectives have become muddled in the United States by an identification with Israel that is too rarely critically examined, non-Americans are mostly incapable of separating what they think of Israel from what they think of the United States. That is why the Japanese politician I interviewed during the first gulf war automatically identified American policy with "Jewish interests." Japan, like much of the modern world, feels uncomfortably dependent on American economic and military power. When people need to invent a malevolent face for this overwhelming might, they often reach for the prejudices of a hateful past. The Japanese politician may never have heard of the 19th-century Russian forgery "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion," but it was widely read in prewar Japan and is enjoying a popular revival in the Middle East today. 
It is perfectly possible, of course, to take a critical view of Israeli policies, and of their support in Washington, without being anti-Semitic. It is equally possible to be critical of American policies without being irrationally and emotionally anti-American. Just so, you can be opposed to capitalism, or "globalization," without wishing to unleash or condone suicide attacks on Manhattan. What is disturbing, however, is the way these views now increasingly come together in a hostile cocktail. Most mass demonstrations in Europe, and elsewhere, against the war in Iraq contained banners in support of the Palestinians, even the religious extremists of Hamas, and against the global symbols of capitalism. For some people on the left, being opposed to Israel, or Zionism, goes beyond specific policies in Gaza or the West Bank; Israel is seen as the colonial Western presence in an Arab world, an American client state locked into global capitalism. Even if the Israelis treated the Palestinians with the most scrupulous generosity -- which they do not -- this impression would persist.
Not every demonstrator against Ariel Sharon's government or American imperialism is an anti-Semite, to be sure, but the ready identification of Jewish interests with the United States or, in the past, with Britain is old and loaded with prejudice. Since the early 19th century, many Europeans associated the City of London, as Wall Street is today, with financial power, materialist greed and economic imperialism. To ethnic nationalists in Germany and elsewhere, Britain and France, with their relative openness to immigrants, were seen as mongrel nations, where citizenship could be bought for a crock of gold. 
This is what Hitler meant when he called France, Britain and the United States "Jewified." He took the view, popularized by all manner of third-rate scribblers, that a Jewish cabal was manipulating Western powers behind the scenes. French universalism and Anglo-Saxon capitalism, so it was believed, threatened the unique values of culture and race. And behind all this were the Jews, pulling strings in their cosmopolitan network of banks, newspapers and movie companies.
The United States is now the biggest capitalist power in the world. To the extent that it is an empire, it is driven by economic interests, but also, these days, by a mission to spread "American values," as if they were universal. Hollywood is seen in the outside world as part of this, and so are Wall Street, the Pentagon and the International Monetary Fund. This, alas, is precisely the kind of thing anti-Semites have always associated with Jewish conspiracies. And since Israel is America's most favored ally in the Middle East, and the Palestinian cause has become the universal litmus test of liberal credentials, the idea that Jewish interests are driving American foreign policy is even more widely believed, if not always openly stated. American foreign policy and ancient prejudices are reinforcing each other in a vicious circle. 
For Israel, the American embrace is an ambiguous advantage. Although perhaps vital for the nation's survival, it also makes Israel the hub of global hostility toward the United States. It is, in any case, doubtful that the fate of Israel is best served by its dependence on an alliance with Christian fundamentalists and people on a mission to liberate the world with military force. It may well be that Israel's interests coincide with those of the United States for the moment, but this should not be a given, never to be examined or reassessed. 
The first condition for a reasoned examination would be to disentangle Israel's politics from all the anti-Semitic myths and other leftovers of a murderous past. This is not so easily done, since Israeli leaders have too often abused history themselves. The Israeli bomb attack on an Iraqi nuclear installation in 1981 might have been justified in many legitimate ways, but to say, as Prime Minister Menachem Begin did, that it was to protect "the children of Israel," asking foreign reporters, "Haven't you heard of one and a half million little children who were thrown into gas chambers?" is to dangerously confuse the issue. The same was true when Prime Minister Sharon warned the United States last year not to repeat the mistakes of 1938 and sell out Israel like Czechoslovakia. Such false analogies serve only to invite equally odious comparisons from Israel's critics.
Disentangling American and Israeli interests and government actions is, if anything, even harder. To see Israel as nothing but a cat's paw of American imperialism in the Middle East is a crude distortion. And to hold Washington responsible for every Israeli action against the Palestinians is equally misguided. But it is neither anti-Semitic nor blindly anti-American to point out that the United States could have done much more to stop Israel from humiliating the Palestinians by turning the occupied territories into a kind of Wild East of gunslinging settlers and hounded natives. 
Finally, the politics of the Middle East may be murderous, but it is not helpful to see them as an existential battle between good and evil. As long as such a view persists, among zealots in Washington, Jerusalem and Nablus, the struggle between Jews and Arabs will be forever obscured by a fog of noxious myths and fantasies. Religious fanaticism is confounding the politics of Israel, as well as that of its enemies. And its influence is felt in the United States as well. Americans are right to support Israel's right to exist in peace, but criticism of Israeli policies should not be stifled by Christian visions of Armageddon, right-wing zealotry or memories of the culture wars in Brooklyn. This would not be good for America, and it is certainly not good for the Jews.

 BODY:
Walter Kirn's deceptively facile essay on unemployment states baldly that the only two reasons people get jobs are to make money and to dodge annoying spouses (The Way We Live Now, Aug. 17). In making this claim, he unintentionally reflects the horrifically corroded values of modern America, in which one can write what appears to be a thoughtful piece on vocation without ever mentioning what has gone missing from the employment scene altogether: the learning of a craft or a trade as a lifestyle, the thing that for centuries gave meaning to the lives of even those people who had no money and annoying spouses. 
The monks who illuminated manuscripts and the woodworkers who spent years creating a single room in a palace and the clockmakers who destroyed their vision to make a useful but beautiful instrument did so, yes, to earn their keep; but they also did so with the thought that some little bit of divinity was embodied in their humble work, and would live on after them. This attitude can still be found in some craftsmen, artisans and laborers in America, although to say it is dying would be a cheerful spin. And obviously, it is dead in the so-called artists of Kirn's clever but spiritually dead stripe.
 It's a good thing Kirn never got that Camaro that he identifies as simply a material object; he would never have understood what a divine instrument he was actually driving.

 BODY:
 Certainly, most people need to earn money to live, but that is far from being the only factor in not having a job. People need to work in order to be able to make a contribution, and I would suggest that it is a feeling of uselessness, as much as the lack of money, that is so soul-destroying for the unemployed. Any job, no matter how menial it may appear, allows a person to have some dignity, and it is not in the nature of the vast majority of civilization to be idle. There are also many jobs that give a good degree of job satisfaction. As an Englishman who lives and works in the United States, I can state that the majority of Americans, and particularly those involved in manual jobs and in the service industries, work extremely hard, and take great pride in giving their best.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/New Jersey; 
Cities Outpace Suburbs in Difficult Office Market

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
WHILE the office real estate market in northern New Jersey has taken a lengthy beating in both cities and suburbs, the cities -- particularly Newark -- have emerged as tougher survivors of hard economic times, most assessments show.
 Newark's office vacancy rate now stands at 13 to 14 percent, according to various real estate company reports and broker estimates. In suburban Parsippany, by comparison, the vacancy rate has been more than 20 percent for more than two years, decreasing a percentage point in the second quarter of 2003, to 22.3 percent, according to Cushman & Wakefield's numbers. 
 In other suburban pockets, perhaps most notably the one along the northwestern section of Route 78 -- where the telecommunications industry used to loom large -- the vacancy rate is close to 30 percent, several market specialists said. 
"This could only look good," one said, "next to the availability along Route 78 in Somerset County." On a stretch of that Interstate highway in central New Jersey, Cushman said, the vacancy rate was 36.1 percent at midyear.
"It all depends on what the pillars of a marketplace are," said Dudley Ryan, a senior vice president of Trammell Crow. "Route 78 was more dependent upon the telecommunications-related industries, so they were hurt more when that industry fell down. Newark has been the strongest market through the recession because its pillars are government, law and insurance -- which are not as vulnerable to the whims of the economy."
Right now, though, there are signs that both urban and suburban office markets are picking up -- each in its own way.
Charles Ramat, who is president of the Kushner Companies, which owns office properties in Newark and several suburban markets, said there had been a "surge in customers and renting" in both markets. 
Kushner is trying to attract a major law firm for a 50,000-square-foot space in its refurbished Military Park building in Newark, where a number of small firms, foundations and title companies are already ensconced. In Florham Park, Kushner has almost completed assembling Columbia Corporate Center, a five-building office parkcampus made up of two buildings it owned for several years, two it recently acquired and one it is building.
"There has been a definite increase in traffic the last several months, clientele looking at the buildings," Mr. Ramat said. "Traffic is an important factor."
Jeffrey L. Heller, a senior director at Cushman, said there were suddenly many more customers shopping for office space in various markets at what is ordinarily a slow time of year. "I manage a team of six guys, and it's beginning to affect our lifestyle," he quipped, "eating into our vacation time." 
His counterpart at CB Richard Ellis, Thomas Reilly, talked about the potential for a "healthy drop" in the overall vacancy rate by the end of the third quarter. He also mentioned the possibility of plugging two capacious holes -- one in Jersey City amid the state's biggest and busiest office market on the Hudson waterfront, and the other in Basking Ridge at the sprawling former AT&T complex, now owned by Pfizer.
In Jersey City, much broker speculation is focused on a possible match between the 40-story, 1.5-million-square-foot Goldman Sachs building going up on Hudson Street, and a concern currently looking for a million square feet: the Mellon Financial Group.
Mellon, now spread out in nine buildings in six communities in northern New Jersey, seeks to consolidate its human resources group into one building with good commuter access for 4,000 employees. Goldman Sachs has said that it plans to occupy the riverfront building at the old Colgate site, but real estate analysts predict it will use only a fraction of the space.
As for the 2.7-million-square-foot Basking Ridge complex, speculation is rife among brokers that Pfizer has decided to stop marketing and use the space itself, so-called backfilling. Pfizer obtained the property when it acquired Pharmacia earlier this year; Pharmacia bought the seven-building, 140-acre complex from AT&T just weeks before being acquired.
Mr. Ryan said he understood that the huge space -- which pushes up the vacancy rate for the entire area -- was off the market.
Mr. Reilly said: "I think there is a distinct possibility that is what could happen. If the rumors of Pfizer backfilling and Mellon taking one million square feet at Goldman Sachs are true, that makes the market a lot healthier in one whack."
Several brokers mentioned positive developments in Parsippany -- northern Jersey's third-largest market after the Hudson waterfront and Newark -- in the last two months after a relatively stagnant first half. Pfizer took two blocks of space, leasing an office at Morris Corporate Center IV and subleasing space at 5 Woodhollow Drive that American Express has been marketing since returning to Manhattan after using the Parsippany space in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.
The largest deal in Parsippany so far this year involved Reckitt Benckiser, a British maker of household cleaning and speciality food products, which decided to relocate its North American headquarters from Wayne, N.J., and to sublet 139,538 square feet from Aventis at Morris Corporate Center IV. Also in that building, Aventis continued to backfill, deciding to use an additional 88,462 square feet -- and leaving only 42,000 square feet vacant in the building.
The vast quantities of sublease space that became available with the telecommunications bust that began two years ago decimated Parsippany's office market, Mr. Heller of Cushman said. Offices of any size, many fully furnished, laden with amenities and telecommunications hookups, are widely available for sublet from companies ready to offer various concessions to unload space that will otherwise sit empty. 
COMPANIES offering blocks of sublet space of more than 50,000 square feet in Morris County, where Parsippany is situated, include Lucent, Cherry Road Technologies, Accenture, Tycom, Chubb and Wyeth. 
But sublease space is beginning to decline in Parsippany, according to Cushman's most recent quarterly report, with many original leases expiring this year and next, and responsibility reverting to the landlord. Currently, sublease space accounts for 39 percent of the available space, down from 47 percent at the end of 2002. 
Asking rental rates are beginning to decline, Cushman's second-quarter report said. Class A office rental rates declined $1 per square foot, falling below $30 per square foot annually for the first time since 1999.
In Newark, asking rents held steady at about $33 per square foot at midyear, Cushman reported. Leasing activity was up, primarily because of expansion by law firms. The Internal Revenue Service also renewed its lease of 42,687 square feet at One Newark Center.

HEADLINE: School Bells Ring In Changes 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
HOGWARTS will soon be in session.
 The new four-level middle school at Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn Heights, which is to open on Sept. 8, has been built within the prickly Gothic 19th-century shell of a former Anglican church. Some classrooms look out on to multicusped tracery windows through a screen of sweeping timber arches. The flexible teaching space on the top level soars to a pointed arch 47 feet high. 
 Corridors weave in and out of ornament-encrusted cast-iron columns, whose floral capitals are almost close enough to touch. Stained-glass seraphim gaze over a staircase from a giant rose window. No wonder readers of Harry Potter already call it Hogwarts. (Indeed, some teachers and administrators dressed up as wizards last May to celebrate the opening of the dining hall and faculty lounge in the old parish house next door.) 
Packer's $23 million project may be the most unusual recent renovation of a landmark or landmark-quality school building, but it is not the only one. As students return to class around New York City, they will find any number of schools looking bigger and fresher than they have in years.
Village Community School has almost doubled in size by grafting a complementary new structure to its 19th-century home at 272 West 10th Street. The Spence School has turned a landmark mansion at 56 East 93rd Street into its new lower school, burrowing deep into bedrock -- as noise-bedeviled neighbors can attest -- to create a subterranean gymnasium.
All three projects were financed in part through tax-exempt bonds issued by the city's Industrial Development Agency, which -- despite its name -- extends construction and renovation assistance to certain nonprofit corporations, including private elementary and secondary schools, for job creation or retention. Since 1990, it has issued more than $400 million in bonds on behalf of more than 30 private schools, attended by some 17,000 students, that employ more than 4,600 people.
Among public schools, the School of the Future at Lexington Avenue and 22nd Street has emerged from a $4.6 million renovation of its terra-cotta facade, part of a larger initiative by the School Construction Authority. "There have been two major components of the previous capital plans," said E. Bruce Barrett, vice president for architecture and engineering at the authority. "One is new seats and the other is exterior renovation. You've got to get the buildings watertight."
While "Future" is an apt name for the 13-year-old college-preparatory program in which about 600 students are enrolled, it is an incongruous designation for the building, an 86-year-old structure designed by C. B. J. Snyder in the Collegiate Gothic style. As the ornate letters on one facade proclaim, this was originally the Manhattan Trade School for Girls. At 10 stories, it is still one of the tallest school buildings in the city.
Responding to reports of spalling terra cotta, the authority undertook a detailed analysis of the facade, working with engineers from Robert Silman Associates and a company called GBG of Cambridge, England. The English company specializes in nondestructive inspection techniques, including thermal images that reveal the condition of masonry by graphically displaying its temperature.
About 20 percent of the terra cotta -- including the pilasters and the quatrefoil parapet -- was replaced, said Parmesh Nizambad, a structural engineer at theauthority. The building is now free of scaffolding for the first time in three years.
IN Brooklyn, another Gothic structure recently liberated from scaffolding is the former St. Ann's Episcopal Church at Clinton and Livingston Streets, which stands at one end of Packer's L-shaped complex.
Designed by James Renwick Jr., St. Ann's Church and adjacent parish house were purchased by Packer in 1969. Under a renovation designed by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, they have now been fully integrated with the other buildings through a glass-walled atrium constructed in the crook of the L.
Though the Victorian Gothic church looks largely unchanged on the outside -- except for the replacement of many stained-glass windows by clear, diamond-patterned panes -- it is now a kind of structural shell for an entirely new classroom structure that fills much of the original nave.
The idea of inserting a modern building into a 134-year-old church was so daunting that the architect, Hugh Hardy, cheerfully confessed this month that he did not want to take on the project at first. "Do you know how many code issues there are?" he asked. He credited Pamela J. Loeffelman, formerly in his firm (now at Perkins Eastman), with having persuaded him to try, and Packer with having endorsed the solution.
"You couldn't get any old client to do this," Mr. Hardy said.
Robert Silman Associates served as structural engineers and the Lehr Construction Corporation as construction manager, working with HRH Construction.
Packer, which has 935 students from preschool through the 12th grade, is financing the project through a $13 million Industrial Development Agency bond issue and a $10 million capital campaign. "We've crossed the finish line," Lynn B. Bunis, the development director and a Packer parent, said last week. In fact, she said, the campaign raised slightly more than $11 million.
In laying out the new middle school, the first impulse would have been to place the classrooms against exterior windows, with a corridor through the middle. The architects proposed instead that the classrooms be stacked within the nave, allowing the flanking aisles to serve as circulation areas and as light courts. "We filled up the middle and left the outside free, so you get a sense of the whole," Mr. Hardy said. 
The new 20,000-square-foot classroom stack is faced in etched mirror glass, which softly reflects the dull yellow of the surrounding walls. There is an additional 8,000 square feet of new space in the basement.
To open up the side aisles, the balconies were removed. And to increase the amount of daylight reaching the interior, many of the stained-glass windows were taken out. These were placed at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, N.Y., and St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia, according to Levien & Company, which served as Packer's representative on the job. The windows that remained were restored by Clerkin Higgins Stained Glass Inc.
More than 80 pews have been refurbished and will be placed throughout the school as places for the students to hang out, said Andrei S. Harwell, the project architect. Most of the religious iconography was removed but two Christian monograms -- iota-eta-sigma, a reference to Jesus, and alpha-omega -- remain in the rose window. "It was an Episcopal church," Mr. Hardy said, "and that's part of the story."
"Education has to be about one generation teaching or explaining values to the next generation," Mr. Hardy said. "Here, it's the celebration of new meeting old."
That meetingoccurs much more obviously at Village Community School, which has built a four-story addition on the corner of 10th and Washington Streets, where its gymnasium -- a converted garage and trucking warehouse -- stood until 2001.
The Washington Street facade of the new building hews to the 60-foot scale of the apartment buildings next door. It intersects a wall on 10th Street that is 14 feet higher, to complement the existing school, which was built in 1885 as Public School 7 and later served as the parochial school of St. Veronica's Roman Catholic Church, on the same block but facing Christopher Street.
As designed by Leo J. Blackman Architects, the 10th Street facade of the new building is built in a matching red brick, with the same pattern of window bays and ornamental two-tone spandrels. Importantly, it also has the same generous 15 1/2-foot floor heights as the old building. Given the overall height of 74 feet, Mr. Blackman said, two more floors could have been squeezed into the structure. "But it wouldn't have had a sense of being part of the existing building," he said.
Eve K. Kleger, the director of Village Community School, said, "Two different divisions would have been contrary to the philosophy of the school."
Founded in 1970 by Sheila Sadler, after the Bank Street School decamped for the Upper West Side, Village Community School has 310 students in kindergarten through eighth grade. The 24,000-square-foot addition is not intended to increase enrollment but to provide desperately needed space.
How desperately? The nurse's office occupies the small wing at stage right in the old assembly hall and the development office occupies the small wing at stage left. The stage itself is used for math, French and music classes. "The development officer can hum all the tunes," Ms. Kleger said.
And until this year, the eighth-grade home rooms were in the basement. Mr. Blackman suggested a motto for the new building: "No child left underground."
Actually, they will be slightly underground in the assembly hall. Roughly half of its 21-foot height is below grade, meaning that the clerestory windows are at sidewalk level. The gymnasium sits atop the building, where there is also a fanciful rooftop play area, covered in three-inch-thick padding made of recycled tires and furnished with plastic Philippe Starck chairs.
The school raised $6.5 million through an Industrial Development Agency bond issue and began a $5 million capital campaign. "We're close to having the total pledge amount," said Steven Skulnik, the immediate past chairman of the school council, equivalent to the board of trustees. The $11.5 million total covers construction costs, fees and the retirement of existing debt.
The structural engineer was Anastos Engineering Associates and the construction manager was C. R. Raimondo & Sons. Mr. Blackman was formerly a partner in Buttrick White & Burtis, which originally won the Village Community School commission but has since dissolved.
ANOTHER Buttrick White & Burtis commission that moved with its partner -- in this case, Samuel G. White, who is now at Platt Byard Dovell White -- was the renovation of 56 East 93rd Street for Spence, a girls' school whose main building is at 22 East 91st Street. It is to be the lower school, kindergarten through fourth grade, serving 241 of Spence's 622 students. The structural engineer is Anastos Engineering and the construction manager is the F. J. Sciame Construction Company.
One of the last mansions built in New York City, 56 East 93rd Street was completed in 1931 for William Goadby Loew, a stockbroker and sportsman. The architect, A. Stewart Walker of Walker & Gillette, worked on the Loew house with his wife, Sybil, a decorator. She undertook a treasure hunt through England for the furnishings, including Georgian pine paneling in the great drawing room, which has monumental Corinthian columns and pilasters.
The house was later occupied by the showman Billy Rose and then by the Smithers Alcoholism Treatment and Training Center of Roosevelt Hospital, from which Spence bought the building in 1999 for $15.5 million.
Spence had searched wide for a site on which to expand, but not far. "We wanted it to be within walking distance because we wanted a campus feeling," said Arlene Joy Gibson, the head of school. The Loew mansion "looked as close as we could envision to being a school," she said, and had the footprint needed for a new gymnasium.
The building's distinctively concave facade appears unchanged and the drawing room, still richly paneled, will serve as the new dining hall. The library will run the length of the 93rd Street facade on the second floor. "It's going to give amazing life back to the street," Mr. White said.
But the structure underwent extensive interior alterations to accommodate 15 new classrooms. "It's almost as if somebody said, 'We like your body, but all the bones are in the wrong place,' " Mr. White said.
The most significant change was the excavation by hoe rams of almost 6,000 cubic yards of Manhattan schist to create a new gym. "It looked," Mr. White said, "like the digging of the Panama Canal." 
To support the building over this newly created void, a steel truss 80 feet long and 12 feet high was constructed at the rear of the ground floor. It is now hidden within the interior of the building, its presence given away only by the unusual thickness of certain walls.
After the weight of the building was transferred from the original structural system to the new one, "the only thing that moved was the front stoop, which dropped about an eighth of an inch," said Robert D. Trostle, senior project manager at Sciame.
What had been a penthouse was expanded into a full fifth floor for second- and fourth-grade classrooms, under a sloping roof set far enough back from the facade that it cannot be seen from street level. The enclosure of a rear balcony permitted the creation of new classroom space on the third, fourth and fifth floors.
Approval by the Landmarks Preservation Commission was not easily won, as neighbors -- Woody Allen among them -- objected in 2000 to plans calling for a new sixth floor with a science laboratory. Elimination of the sixth floor compelled Spence to excavate an additional floor below ground to accommodate the lost program space.
Moving the lower school from 91st Street has permitted a renovation by Fox & Fowle of that 74-year old building. The number of general purpose classrooms will be increased, science labs will be added or rehabilitated, and a drama studio, music lab and common area for the middle school will be built. To finance the renovation of both buildings, Spence has a $50 million capital campaign. "We're very close to making that," Ms. Gibson said. The Industrial Development Agency also issued $16.5 million in bonds.
The new lower school is to open on Sept. 15. Ms. Gibson might have been speaking for any of her counterparts at other schools as she stood outside the building last week and said, above the din of 11th-hour construction, "I want to see it full of children now."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: New $2 Million Center to Open; 
Information On Downtown

 BODY:
An 1,800-square-foot information center is to open on Thursday at 25 Broad Street with a mission of providing anything residents, visitors and businesses want to know about Lower Manhattan: office and store vacancies, updates on the project at the World Trade Center site, the closest Chinese restaurant to City Hall.
 "Hopefully, there will never be a question we can't answer," said Julie Menin, founder and president of Wall Street Rising, which created the center and will run it. 
The organization is a nonprofit coalition of businesses, cultural institutions, residents and others, and was set up two weeks after the attacks of Sept. 11 to encourage economic development and community spirit on Chambers Street and below. It now has 30,000 members and has raised $6.5 million for its projects. 
 The new $2 million information center was designed pro bono by the Rockwell Group and Fred Schwartz Architects.
It is to have a 12-by-9-foot three-dimensional Plexiglas model of Lower Manhattan and plasma screens listing local events. Besides a half-dozen computers at the center, a Web site (www.downtowninfocenter.org) is to be running on Thursday with a global information system providing coordinates of every building downtown. All residential buildings and their contacts are to be listed on the Web site.
The center is to have seating for up to 54 for lectures, book signings, storytelling and scavenger hunts for children. Its hours are to be 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekends.

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS/CELEBRATIONS; 
Daisy Eagan, Patrick Comer

 BODY:
Daisy Ann Eagan, a daughter of Richard Eagan of Brooklyn and the late Andrea Boroff Eagan, was married yesterday to Patrick Brittan Comer, a son of Judith W. Comer and the Rev. J. Fletcher Comer of Greensboro, Ala. The bridegroom's father, an Episcopal priest, performed the ceremony in Middleburgh, N.Y., at the weekend house of the bride's father and stepmother, Elizabeth Ostrow.
 The bride, 23, will continue to use her name professionally. She is a stage and film actor, and won a Tony award in 1991 for her role as Mary Lennox in the musical production of "The Secret Garden." In 1999 and 2000, she performed several roles in James Joyce's "The Dead" at the Belasco Theater. Her film credits include "Losing Isaiah," which was released in 1995, and "Tony and Tina's Wedding," scheduled to be released in 2004.

HEADLINE: THE AGE OF DISSONANCE; 
Summer of Sun? We Wuz Robbed

BYLINE:  By BOB MORRIS

 BODY:
THE weather was lovely last Tuesday in Brunswick, Me. But that doesn't mean Barbara Held was happy. She was sitting in her office at Bowdoin College there watching the students roll in with their parents for orientation and feeling so miserable that she was giving herself a headache. 
 "Summer's over and we didn't even have one," said Dr. Held, a psychology professor. "This is the only time I have all year to get my writing done." 
 She was aware, of course, that she wasn't the only unhappy resident in Maine. Penobscot Bay had been a vichyssoise of fog for much of the summer, provoking, she said, even the most reserved Mainers to complain at surprising length.
"My husband is a sailor, and he hated the fog," she said. Well, he wasn't alone this year. 
All the Northeastern resorts had a total washout of a June (pun intended), while New York's 10.27 inches of rain made it the wettest June in a century. July had 14 days of rain, and August had its share of gray days, along with one black one. 
When rainwater soaked the basements of homeowners on lovely Georgica Pond in East Hampton, someone illegally dug a ditch that drained it in early July, leaving a quasi mud flat all summer. There were wildfires in Montana. And Europe had beastly killer heat.
During the mid-August blackout in New York, raw sewage closed beaches around the city, spoiling another weekend. And if that isn't enough, the calendar is shortchanging us with a Labor Day on Sept. 1, the shortest possible summer.
Shall we call this one "The Endless Bummer?" 
"Or maybe the summer of our discontent," said Steven Stolman, a designer with shops in Southampton, Palm Beach and New York, who had to struggle harder than usual to make up for his dismal sales in June. "But then expectations are always too high in summer when you have to fit all that fun into three months. Maybe that's why I prefer Palm Beach to Southampton. The season is so much longer." 
Yes, but so is the chance of getting hit by a hurricane. 
And as far as Kitty Hawks is concerned, she was, but in Westchester. The garden at her weekend home has become a soaked, sick bay with black spots and mildew on her roses and dampened bulbs rotting in the saturated earth.
"I love my garden more than life itself," said Ms. Hawks, an interior designer, "and this summer my garden has been drowning."
Maybe she would have preferred baking in Italy? That's what happened to Silvano Marchetto, the ever-cool owner of Da Silvano, the downtown power restaurant, who arrived in Tuscany only to find his lovely native Florence strangely deserted. 
"I thought it was the economy, but then I realized it was the heat," he said. "The temperature in my car was over 100 degrees." After fainting at lunch, Mr. Marchetto began his sojourn under the Tuscan sun in the hospital. "Even the beach was unbearable," he said of Forte dei Marmi, the chic resort where Martha Stewart and Sirio Maccioni, the owner of Le Cirque 2000, were also stewing in their own juices. "You had to run over the hot sand to the water if you didn't want your feet to get burned."
At least the fashionable were sweating off their pounds over there. Around New York, they had lost the usual incentive to shed weight for summer, said Robert Levine, a Manhattan diet doctor.
"The weather in June wasn't good enough for people to think about getting into the kind of clothes that make them want to lose weight," he said.
Nor were they inspired to rent houses in the Hamptons in the numbers they usually do. "It wasn't the summer people had hoped it would be," said Helen Rattray, editor of The East Hampton Star.
But then, is it ever? What season can possibly hold up under such pressure of expectations? Since we were children, we have had it ingrained in our psyches that summer is our reward for working hard all year. You spend large amounts of time and money on a second home or a rental house, and what do you get for it?
"We ended up having to clean the mold off the floors and walls in August from the cold, wet June," said Erica Silverman, an Upper East Sider who rents on Martha's Vineyard. "But I'm so disappointed by other things in life that I can't be that disappointed by thesummer. I think it's a great luxury to be able to be disappointed by the weather." 
Is it possible that the more you have, the more you have to complain about? 
Perhaps that's why high-end vacationers look so dour under their pastels and tans. It's almost as if the stress of having to have all that fun is too much for them. And what about all the children of privilege returning from camps after a summer of torturing parents with letters of woe?
"A counselor told us exactly how many sheets of toilet paper we were allowed to use!" one 9-year-old from Manhattan shrieked about her camp in New Hampshire. Others carped about flies, bad food and turtles in the lake.
Well, God invented language, say Jane Wagner and Lily Tomlin, because of our deep need to complain, and Samuel Johnson once observed that "if a man talks of his misfortunes there is something in them that is not disagreeable to him." Maybe complaining is just a way of showing off, like the bullfrogs carrying on at this time of year. 
Of course, when Labor Day comes so early and people don't feel as ready as usual to embrace the fall, a little carping does seem warranted.
"Look, the awful truth is that on the first day of summer the days are already getting shorter," said Dr. Held, the put-upon psychology professor at Bowdoin, whose book "Stop Smiling, Start Kvetching" (Griffin, 2001) suggests that having to smile through life's problems adds insult to injury. "But I do have to wonder, if the summer was so bad this year, why are we so upset that it's over?"
Let's save that question for the day after tomorrow.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
A Way To Break The Cycle Of Servitude

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
ON this Labor Day weekend, let us remember low-wage workers. Twenty percent of the work force -- 26 million people -- earn $8.23 an hour or less. Most of them are not teenagers snagging pocket money, but adults supporting families. With so little income, too many Americans are pushed into poverty, and getting out of this trap is increasingly difficult.
 As many studies have shown, rising income inequality has driven people apart. And low-wage workers, occupying the bottom rung in this ruptured society, have descended into what amounts to a servant class. It is not their work that makes them servants. We need factory assemblers, store clerks, child care workers and the telephone operators who field calls to "800" numbers, processing much of the nation's commerce. 
 What makes them servants is the miserable pay. Measuring status by wage, as many Americans do, no one -- the employers of low-wage worker, the public or the low-wage workers themselves -- seems to value this class of work. Promotion, or higher pay, would be a way out. Unfortunately, neither solution kicks in very often. More than in the past, low-wage workers are stuck in place.
"There is not any kind of sinister approach by companies or individuals to make this happen," said Jeffrey Joerres, chief executive of Manpower Inc., the temporary-help agency, which places many low-wage workers. "But it is the path that we are on."
That path has become self-perpetuating. Employers are under constant pressure to cut costs. Hospitals, for example, have to bid for good medical staffs, so they offset this cost by squeezing the wages of unskilled kitchen workers. Or they outsource food preparation to contractors who pay even less. In either case, the result is a constant, dispiriting turnover. But it is tolerated. The low wage more than offsets the cost of one or two days of training for each new hire.
So wages barely rise. Adjusted for inflation, the $8.23 an hour today is only 9 percent higher than the $7.55 that the workers in the 20th percentile earned 30 years ago, according to the Economic Policy Institute. All of that improvement came in the very tight labor markets of the late 1990's, when even low-wage workers could command higher pay.
The constant turnover of people in these jobs often leaves the impression that low-wage workers are irresponsible and unambitious. But Eileen Appelbaum, director of the Center for Women and Work at Rutgers University, offers a different explanation. "If you work in a hospital as a nurse's aide, you care about patients, and you are asked to care for more people than you can safely care for and you are afraid you will hurt someone," she said. "So, you leave."
Or you have a personal crisis -- a sick child, for example. Low-wage jobs seldom come with time off, "so you quit, knowing that when you can work again, there will be another rotten job you can get," she added.
Training is a way up the wage ladder, but employers of low-wage workers seldom offer it or give those workers time away from daily tasks. Manpower Inc. offers training, but for jobs that pay $9 an hour and up. Most of the more than 180,000 people that Manpower sends out each day earn at least this wage, but 30 percent draw only $8.50 an hour or less. For them, the instruction is less than respectful. Job readiness, it is called.
"We have a whole set of videotapes that are uncomfortable for me to watch," Mr. Joerres said. "You need to arrive on time. You can only take breaks at break time. Have you taken a shower?"
FAR from lifting these workers, the unfettered American marketplace holds them down. They need help, ideally from employers, if only those employers could find their way back to the pre-1970's system of long-term employment in low-skilled jobs that included training, promotions and raises. In some places, unions still force this to happen -- at New York City hospitals, for example -- and no hospital is at a disadvantage because each is bound by the same wage scale. But in this era of disappearing unions, that is not likely to work. 
Raising the minimum wage would be a quicker route, if only Congress and the administration would make that a priority. The minimum wage once went up regularly, peaking in 1968 at the equivalent of $7.08 an hour today, adjusted for inflation. That's nearly $2 above today's actual minimum of $5.15 an hour. Just restoring the minimum to its old value of $7.08 would also push up wages that are just above the minimum. 
Suddenly, the bottom 20 percent of the work force would be making up to $10 an hour, instead of $8.23. That might be a large enough raise to justify training and job security, and new respect for the men and women in these jobs -- respect as workers, not servants.

Yachts to Call Your Own (If Only for a Vacation)

BYLINE:  By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
CHRISTINE JORDAN and William Krohn celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary last winter in style: they took a weeklong cruise through the British Virgin Islands on a 46-foot yacht they had chartered, complete with a captain and a chef. The couple, from Cleveland, dined every evening on the deck and set their own agenda for the trip. "We could sail or walk on the beach or around town however long we wanted, receive personalized snorkeling instructions," said Dr. Jordan, 53, an anesthesiologist. "That was lovely."
 One of the best parts of the trip, said Dr. Jordan and Mr. Krohn, 51, a newspaper editor, was the price. The charter, arranged by Ed Hamilton & Company in Whitefield, Me., cost $4,600, or around $330 a day per person. (Air fare and the traditional 15 percent tip for the crew were extra.) 
 Yacht charters are clearly no longer only for the rich and famous. The price that Dr. Jordan and Mr. Krohn paid for theirs was similar to the average for commercial cruises on many luxury ships. But other charter deals can cost far less, travel experts say, during off-peak seasons for your destination, or if you book well in advance and have flexible plans. If you are willing to hoist the sail, mop the deck and stay the course -- in other words, to do everything yourself -- the price may fall further.
Travel experts say charters have gained popularity as people seek creative ways to customize their vacations. Charters are available in waters around the world, from the Caribbean, which is most popular in the winter, to the Mediterranean, South Pacific, Pacific Northwest and Alaska, most popular in the summer. Although charter brokers and companies can usually find a yacht for you anywhere, some specialize in specific regions. Interpac, for example, specializes in Mexico, the Pacific Northwest and Turkey, and CEO Expeditions specializes in Alaska.
Rates vary widely. For $1,053 a week, experienced sailors can take a so-called bareboat charter -- the kind on which you do everything yourself -- on a 32-foot Moorings sailboat large enough for four passengers in the British Virgin Islands, through Oct. 24. The price does not include food and air fare. For those looking to be pampered, about $100,000 buys a week from Yachtstore on a 130-foot luxury powerboat, large enough for 10 passengers, in the Caribbean in the winter, with a crew of seven. The price does not include air fare.
Sarah Woods, a senior vice president for account management in Santa Ana, Calif., for Navigant International, a travel management company, has sailed on both cruise ships and chartered yachts with crews. A charter vacation is ideal, she said, for "an adventuresome person who doesn't like a formal or regimented vacation."
"You've got to like the water and sun, and to want to entertain yourself," she said. "It's much more flexible than a cruise vacation."
She prefers yachts with crews to bareboat charters. "When I'm on vacation, I don't want to make up a bed or cook, and my husband's not experienced as a sailor," she said.
In planning a yacht charter vacation to any destination, consider your budget and whether you prefer a powerboat or sailboat or a sedentary or active vacation. "A broker will interview you and ask you these questions, and you should know all these things before you make your call," said Kenny Wooton, editor in chief of Yachting magazine.
Although most brokers have access to the same yachts, some are more knowledgeable than others. You can find an experienced company through personal references, travel agencies that arrange charters or the industry's main trade associations, which include the American Yacht Charter Association, www.ayca.net; the Charter Yacht Brokers Association, www.cyba.net; and the Mediterranean Yacht Brokers Association, www.mybamembers.com.
Most brokers require payment of half the total cost upon booking, with the balance due immediately before departure. They will usually deposit these funds into an escrow account. Because deposits are generally nonrefundable, most brokers recommend that you buy trip cancellation insurance, which can help you recoup any losses if you or a relative fall ill and you cannot make the trip, or if your trip is disrupted by a tropical storm.
If you want to charter a specific boat during peak weeks -- like Christmas or Presidents' Day week in the Caribbean, or July and August in the Mediterranean -- brokers recommend booking 6 to 12 months in advance. These days, though, many travelers prefer to plan closer to the time of departure because of economic and political uncertainties, travel experts say. 
If you book late, of course, the selection of yachts may be limited. But waiting can also lead to discounts.
Some bargains, for example, are available now for Caribbean charters this fall and winter: through Oct. 24, the Moorings is cutting the price of a two-week, 41-foot bareboat charter for six passengers in the British Virgin Islands by 25 percent, to $3,308. For winter bookings made by Oct. 1, Ed Hamilton has a weeklong all-inclusive charter for two, with a crew, on a 44-foot catamaran in the Virgin Islands for $7,980; after Oct. 1, the rate rises to $9,000.
Another way to save money is to charter an older yacht. Rates at the Moorings, for example, are lower for its three- to five-year-old yachts than for its one- and two-year-old ones.
Whatever you pay, chartering lets you spend quality time with friends or family, said Ms. Woods, the executive from Navigant.
"And, unlike on a big ship, you never have to dress up; there are no formal nights," she said. "I was in shorts or a swimsuit all the time."

Charter companies and yacht brokerage firms can match travelers with yachts that suit their budgets and interests. Charter companies include these:

A German Town Tells Volkswagen: We Are Family

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WOLFSBURG, Germany 

 BODY:
THEY don't call it Motown or Motor City, but this industrial burg in the heaths of Lower Saxony now has a nickname that evokes its status as Germany's answer to Detroit.
 For the next six weeks, Wolfsburg, the birthplace and home of Volkswagen, will be known as Golfsburg. 
 The mayor of Wolfsburg, Rolf Schnellecke, ordered the name to be changed on road signs, official letterheads, municipal Web sites and some public buildings to help promote Volkswagen's introduction of its new Golf, the fifth generation of the best-selling hatchback. "We wanted to do it as a sign of sympathy and friendship for Volkswagen," Mr. Schnellecke said. "The Golf is the economic base of the company. If it is a success, the whole city and region will prosper." 
The mayor's campaign, which will run through the period of the Golf's rollout, has drawn complaints from critics who say the name change is hokey and, worse, an unseemly bid by a German city to further the business goals of its largest employer.
The critics, Mr. Schnellecke shoots back, are missing the point. "They don't understand the special relationship between VW and Wolfsburg," he said. "This is not like any other German city."
Indeed, Wolfsburg is the quintessential company town -- a city of 125,000 that was founded in 1938 by order of Hitler to turn out Europe's first mass-produced vehicle, the Volkswagen, or People's Car.
To say Wolfsburg depends on Volkswagen the way Detroit depends on General Motors doesn't begin to capture the symbiosis. Six decades after its founding, Wolfsburg remains a support system for a gargantuan car factory.
These days, that factory is ramping up for Volkswagen's most important product introduction in a decade. Since replacing the ubiquitous Beetle in 1974, the Golf has been Volkswagen's best-selling model. Until last year, when it was overtaken by the Peugeot 206, it was the top-selling car in Europe.
Volkswagen hopes the new Golf will reclaim that title. Each time the company redesigns the car -- it has done so five times in 29 years -- Europe's automobile industry holds its breath.
"This is huge," said Thomas Aney, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Frankfurt. "Even Volkswagen says it is basically a two-model company -- the Golf and the Passat -- with the emphasis on the Golf."
Expectations are running high. About 400 reporters descended on Wolfsburg last Monday to watch Volkswagen's chief executive, Bernd Pischetsrieder, roll out the car. More will swarm over it at the Frankfurt auto show next month.
At first glance, the new Golf looks a lot like the old Golf. Volkswagen has added a few gadgets like electronically adjustable seats. And the car is slightly longer and wider than its predecessor -- a reflection, one Volkswagen official joked, of the expanding girth of its customers.
The company hopes to sell 135,000 new Golfs in 2003 and 600,000 next year. It has not announced when the car will go on sale in the United States, where it trails the Jetta sedan in sales. "They have a lot of momentum behind the launch," Mr. Aney said.
Volkswagen has said little about the Golfsburg campaign, aware that it risks being perceived as meddling in municipal affairs. Mayor Schnellecke said the idea grew out of a meeting he held with journalists.
The Golf is important to Wolfsburg not only because it accounts for 15 percent of Volkswagen's total unit sales, but also because it is actually produced here, in the sprawling factory that dates from the 1940's.
The company has turned over a cavernous production hall to the Golf, outfitting it with the latest in robotic machines. It assembles other models, including a minivan, in Wolfsburg, but the Golf is its bread and butter.
Though much of Volkswagen's assembly line is mechanized, the factory still employs 25,000 workers.
WOLFSBURG has known both feast and famine as Volkswagen has weathered the vicissitudes of the automobile market. Its population spiked in the 1950's and 60's, as Volkswagen grew into a global company, importing foreign workers to meet its demand for labor.
In the early 1990's, however, Volkswagen hit a rough patch, with collapsing sales in the United States and doubts about the quality of its cars. Wolfsburg lost 20,000 jobs in three years, as the company was forced to cut production. The local unemployment rate jumped to nearly 20 percent.
That period brought a painful reckoning. While Volkswagen fought to rebuild its reputation under the forceful leadership of Ferdinand Piech, then its chief executive, Wolfsburg set about diversifying its commercial base beyond Volkswagen.
"It was the starting point for a restructuring of the city," said Klaus-Jorg Siegfried, the director of a museum of city history. "The city and the factory showed that they were able to work together."
With help from the company, Wolfsburg began attracting automotive suppliers and service companies. Mayor Schnellecke himself owns a component supplier, started by his father. Volkswagen is a big customer, attesting to the web of ties between town and firm.
The partnership between Volkswagen and Wolfsburg has flowered further in the last five years -- nowhere more than in Autostadt, a 62-acre complex next to the factory that looks like a cross between a theme park and a world's fair. It encompasses a museum, a Ritz-Carlton hotel and a soaring visitors' center, where customers can pick up their new cars. "We don't sell products here; we sell values," said Nicholas Batten, a spokesman for the Autostadt.
Playing to the German obsession with cars, the park has become one of the country's biggest tourist attractions, drawing two million visitors a year. China's former president, Jiang Zemin, has stayed at the Ritz-Carlton; so have Mick Jagger and the other members of the Rolling Stones.
THE park is the centerpiece of Wolfsburg's improbable effort to transform itself from an industrial site into a tourist destination. With the 1990 reunification of Germany, residents note that Wolfsburg is centrally located.
It is a far cry from the immediate postwar period, when this was a grim industrial outpost, heavily bombed by the Allies and lying less than 10 miles from the barbed-wire border of East Germany. "We were living on the edge of the Western world," said Mayor Schnellecke, as he rode past the twinkling glass towers of the Autostadt in a Phaeton, Volkswagen's majestic new sedan.
The view from the mayor's creamy leather seats looks bright, but fortunes can turn quickly in the car business. Even as Volkswagen trumpets the new Golf, it is struggling with declining profits and fresh questions about its quality, following glitches in some models in the United States.
Nor is the future of the Golf boundless. Volkswagen built nearly 900,000 Golfs in 1999, the first full year of the last redesign. Its 2004 sales target of 600,000 reflects both the fiercer competition from rivals like Peugeot and the splintering of the market.
"The number is not overoptimistic, and it is not pessimistic," said a Volkswagen spokesman, Gunther Scherelis. "It is realistic."
For the people of Golfsburg, the precise numbers are less important than the Golf's dependability. As one of the Mr. Scherelis's colleagues, Manfred Grieger, put it: "The Beetle was the car of the century. The Golf will be the next one, perhaps."

 BODY:
INVESTORS have long been accustomed to the variety of benchmarks for the stock market, and to relatively minor differences in their returns.
 But the differences in recent years have been "some of the most extreme ever seen," according to Jay R. Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Some broad market indexes are near their record highs, for example, and are well above their level of March 2000, when the Internet bubble burst. But other, equally broad indexes are more than 30 percent below that level. 
 Why such a mess? Isn't there a single fact of the matter for market performance?
Unfortunately, no. The most obvious definition of the stock market is the total dollar value of all publicly traded stocks. This is what is measured by the Wilshire 5000, which, despite its name, currently reflects the performances of the more than 7,000 regularly traded stocks in the United States. On July 31, that index was down more than 30 percent from its high in March 2000.
This way of compiling a benchmark, known as value weighting, may be the most widely used. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, for example, is figured this way.
But the method has a drawback. A stock's weight in the index is a function of its market capitalization. Because the market cap of Microsoft, for example, is 35 times more than Apple Computer's, the weight of Microsoft in such an index is also 35 times greater. Because many money managers are just as likely to pick a small- or mid-cap stock as a large one, the appropriate benchmark for judging their stock-picking abilities is one that gives equal weight to each stock. 
The solution to the problem seems straightforward: calculate the average percentage change of all stocks, without regard to market cap. Indexes that do this are known as arithmetic averages.
Wilshire Associates says the Wilshire 5000 would have been 24 percent higher on July 31 this year than it was on March 31, 2000, had it been an arithmetic average. That is 54 percentage points greater than its value-weighted return.
Arithmetic averages have a drawback, too: their returns will always be higher than what an investor would earn by buying and holding the average stock. This difference is caused by the way arithmetic averages deal with underperforming and overperforming stocks in order to preserve stocks' equal weight. 
AS a solution to that bias, some people have suggested a third way. Instead of averaging stocks' percentage changes, it would base the indexes on an average of those changes' logarithms, which results in lower returns than those of arithmetic averages. The Value Line Geometric Composite uses this procedure to calculate the average return of 1,700 widely followed stocks. As of July 31, it was 27 percent below its level on March 31, 2000, while the Value Line Arithmetic Composite, an arithmetic average of those same stocks, was 20 percent higher.
But averaging the logarithm of stocks' percentage gains causes an excessive correction of the upward bias of arithmetic averages. Andrew Metrick, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said that returns calculated this way would always be lower than those of a portfolio divided equally among all stocks, except in the very unlikely event that all stocks had the same returns.
A fourth method, used by the Dow Jones industrial average, has even more serious drawbacks. A stock's weight in the Dow depends on its price, which makes the Dow an appropriate benchmark only if you are likelier to buy expensive stocks.
In the absence of a perfect benchmark, the best course for you and your money manager is to agree in advance on the benchmark against which he will be judged. Never allow a manager to pick that benchmark after the fact, because he will undoubtedly find one that makes his performance look remarkable.

HEADLINE: Investing; 
In These 401(k)'s, Workers Do Less to Save More

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH HARRIS

 BODY:
PEOPLE who never think about investing for retirement may soon find that their bosses are stepping in -- by forcing them to make decisions about the future. 
 Alarmed by the disinclination of employees to save, more companies are aiming to increase participation in their 401(k) retirement plans and to set them up so employees commit to making steadily larger contributions. 
 In July, for example, Safelite Glass of Columbus, Ohio, an automobile glass company and manager of property and casualty claims, started arranging for employees to automatically contribute more each year to their 401(k)'s.
"In some respects, we were trying to protect people from themselves," said Doug Herron, the chief financial officer, who serves on the company's retirement committee and helped oversee changes in the plan. 
New research from the field of behavioral finance, which draws on psychology and economics, provides data on the disconnect between the desire to prepare for retirement and the failure to do so. Researchers have found that for many investors, the task of sifting through pamphlets about their company's 401(k) plans ranges from unpleasant to horrible. 
Some people end up doing nothing when confronted with the need to pick savings goals, select appropriate asset allocations, screen investment choices and rebalance their portfolios regularly.
"We know if you ask people, they say they would like to save more," said Richard H. Thaler, the Robert P. Gwinn professor of economics and behavioral science at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. Economists make fun of statements like that, Dr. Thaler said, because it is obvious that people are not acting on their expressed desires, suggesting that they are insincere. 
"But what's true is, we don't make statements about everything," he said. "We don't say, 'Gee, I'd really like to smoke, or eat more French fries.' When people say that, then you have an opportunity. They're telling you that they would like to do something. They have good intentions."
Dr. Thaler and Shlomo Benartzi, an associate professor of accounting at the Anderson School at the University of California at Los Angeles, have come up with a way to turn good intentions into results. They have developed a framework called Save More Tomorrow, which allows investors to save more by committing to gradual increases over time. 
"We know that people are not saving enough, and the recent market didn't help," Dr. Benartzi said. "The 401(k) accounts turned into 201(k)'s."
Research shows that when employees have to fill out paperwork, their participation in savings plans is low. When they must open their own 401(k) plans, the participation rate for workers with less than 12 months of tenure is 50 percent, compared with 90 percent when employees are enrolled automatically but may opt out, said Brigitte Madrian, an associate professor in the business and public policy department at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. 
"What's missing from the 401(k) arena at most companies is something that makes it easy for the people who are not Wall Street financiers to participate in the 401(k) plan -- something that gets people in early, with a sensible contribution rate and sensible asset allocation," Dr. Madrian said. "I'm encouraged over the last couple of years we can see companies starting to recognize this." 
Research also shows that giving employees too many choices can confuse them. Sheena S. Iyengar, the Sanford C. Bernstein associate professor of leadership and ethics at the Columbia Business School, has found that 401(k) participation peaks at 75 percent when a retirement plan offers two investment options. Her results, based on data from 647 company retirement plans run by the Vanguard Group, also show that participation drops to 60 percent when investors have 60 choices. With each additional 10 choices, participation falls by 2 percent.
"I don't think people are choosing not to choose," Dr. Iyengar said. "They're thinking: 'I don't have the time right now to go through this. I'll do my homework later.' They're not consciously thinking, 'Let me be irrational.' "
After a periodic review of its retirement plan offerings, the Ford Motor Company, which once had 60 fund choices, reduced the number to 36 last year by dropping some and adding others. 
"The goal was to offer an entire portfolio without being redundant and without making the entire portfolio so large that it could be confusing for employees," said Anne Marie Gattari, a company spokeswoman. 
Some employers are making or considering changes in their plans. This fall, TIAA-CREF, the financial services company, will adjust the retirement plan it offers at Loyola University of Chicago. Employees will be encouraged to increase the funding of their plan each July, when they get their annual raises. That way, the deduction will cancel out the increase -- resulting in a less painful way to save. 
Also in the fall, T. Rowe Price will begin its version of automatic contribution increases. Ten of the plans it administers for companies will allow investors to increase contributions automatically each year. 
Vanguard rolled out one of the first such savings systems, for Philips Electronics North America, and will offer it to other companies this fall, said Stephen P. Utkus, a retirement researcher at Vanguard. 
"We have to come up with a more flexible model that gets them to a good place without them having to make a lot of active choices," Mr. Utkus said.
Philips started its program in April 2002 for two divisions. In both, the initial average savings rate was around 3 percent. Each division was offered the same program, but employees in one of them were given the option of meeting with a financial planner. 
Dr. Benartzi and Dr. Thaler studied their investment decisions. In the division that did not have access to the planner, 17 percent of employees chose to raise their savings each year. But in the division that had access to the planner, 38 percent chose to increase their savings. Nearly 42 percent of employees in that division met with the planner, and four-fifths of those who did increased their savings. 
SAFELITE already has a track record in tweaking its retirement plan to improve savings. In 1998, the company began enrolling employees automatically in its 401(k). Since then, participation has doubled, to about 95 percent of the more than 6,000 employees.
But the company also wanted its workers to continue to save more. Under the new plan, which is based on the ideas of Dr. Thaler and Dr. Benartzi, the employee contribution automatically increases by one percentage point a year until the federal limit of $12,000 a year is reached. Again, employees can opt out of that schedule of increases.
Robert P. Brooks, 39, who has supervised sales staff for Safelite since 2000, said that before joining the company, he had never given much thought to investing. "Prior to coming on board, I really neglected that part of my life," he said.
But starting in July, when the company changed its plan, he agreed to increase his 401(k) contribution each July by one percentage point.
"It truly is the easiest and most comfortable way to do more in my case for my retirement," Mr. Brooks said. "I don't have the time to invest in researching the market and mutual funds and stocks. I would almost have to go back to school to understand; it's an overwhelming prospect for an average person."
But now, Mr. Brooks finds himself passing along what he has learned to his four daughters.
"I certainly want to help them prepare for life," he said.

On a Pier Made for Working, the Public Wants a Place to Play

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE

 BODY:
Some piers are made for fishing, others for strolling. Pier 94, which runs from 52nd Street to 54th Street along the Hudson River, is reserved strictly forworking. 
 For five years, Pier 94 has been used as an exhibition hall known as the UnConvention Center. While other riverfront piers have been refashioned into public parks, Pier 94 sticks out like a private fortress, cordoned off from the public by chain-link fence and barbed wire. 
 Park advocates had hoped to reclaim parts of the pier. But the city, which owns the pier, is now proposing to extend the UnConvention Center's lease for up to 12 years, and shrink the amount of public space required under the city's waterfront zoning rules. 
"The proposal restricts public access on public property," said John Doswell, a member of Community Board 4, which includes Clinton.
 Of particular concern, Mr. Doswell added, is how the convention center will relate to the future Clinton Cove Park, a three-acre space that abuts the north side of the pier. 
The UnConvention Center was established under the Giuliani administration, in part to replace the space lost for midsize tradeshows when the Coliseum at Columbus Circle was demolished. Such shows typically draw 2,000 to 3,000 visitors a day. 
 The T-shaped structure, which was built in 1959 as a Cunard Line freight terminal, has 190,000 square feet of exhibition space on a single floor. The finger building, the stem of the T, juts out about 750 feet over the river and is ringed by a catwalk. The head house, the top of the T, faces the West Side Highway and serves as the entrance.
 Community groups wanted the entire catwalk to be open to the public. In addition, they wanted to enlarge the public space by lopping off a third of the head house, transforming the T into an L. But the development group, led by Elyse N. Kroll, a trade show producer and president of the UnConvention Center, said that was not economically or logistically feasible. 
 Instead, the developers have offered to keep two sides of the catwalk open; the south side would be used to store heating and cooling equipment. Last week, the developers also offered to carve out a small, 650-square-foot cafe at the north edge of the head house, with restrooms.
 Neighbors said that the public was still being shortchanged, but they might support the cafeanyway. "I don't think we can get much more out of them," said Pam Frederick, a Community Board 4 member. DENNY LEE

Brother, Can You Spare a Day?

BYLINE:  By EDWARD T. O'DONNELL; Edward T. O'Donnell is the author of "Ship Ablaze: The Tragedy of the Steamboat General Slocum," published this year by Broadway Books.

 BODY:
ONE hundred-twenty-one years ago Labor Day meant something more than a three-day weekend and the unofficial end of summer. On Sept. 5, 1882, thousands of workers in New York risked being fired for taking an unauthorized day off to participate in festivities honoring honest toil and the rights of labor. This first commemoration of Labor Day testified to labor's rising power and unity in the Gilded Age and its sense that both were necessary to withstand the growing power of capital. 
 The Labor Day holiday originated with the Central Labor Union, a local labor federation formed the previous January to promote the interests of workers in the New York area. The organization immediately became a formidable force, staging protest rallies, lobbying state legislators and organizing strikes and boycotts. By August membership boomed to 56 unions representing 80,000 workers. 
 But the organization's activists wanted to do more than just increase membership and win strikes. They wanted to build worker solidarity in the face of jarring changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution. 
 Gilded Age workers were alarmed by the growing power of employers over their employees. Bosses were free to increase hours, slash wages and fire workers at will. Equally disconcerting was the growing gap between rich and poor, a disparity made shockingly clear in the Gilded Age by the growing army of poorly paid workers and the emergence of millionaire industrialists and financiers with names like Morgan, Rockefeller and Carnegie. 
 Nowhere were those changes more apparent than in New York, the capital of capitalism, a city populated with abundant laborers, ambitious entrepreneurs willing to exploit them in their relentless pursuit of profit, and political leaders unwilling to exercise restraint. These developments, labor leaders noted, called into question the future of the American Republic. 
 The organization's activists believed that the establishment of a day celebrating the honest worker would open their eyes and compel them to reclaim their dwindling rights. Doing so in New York, the city where the excesses of industrial capitalism were most evident and media exposure was greatest, would send a message to workers nationwide. 
 The precise identity of the Central Labor Union leader who in May 1882 first proposed the idea of establishing Labor Day remains a mystery. Some accounts say it was P.J. McGuire, general secretary of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners and the future co-founder of the A.F.L., who proposed the idea. Others argue that it was another man with a similar last name, machinist Matthew Maguire. Whatever the answer, both men played crucial roles in promoting and organizing the original holiday. 
After months of preparation, the chosen day -- Sept. 5, a Tuesday -- finally arrived. Optimism among the organizers ran high, but no one knew how many workers would turn out. Few could expect their employers to grant them a day off and many feared getting fired for union activity. When William G. McCabe, the parade's first grand marshal and a popular member of Local No. 6 of the International Typographers Union, arrived an hour before the parade's start, only a few dozen workers stood milling about City Hall Park.
 To the relief of Mr. McCabe and other organizers, some 400 men and a brass band assembled by the time the parade stepped off at 10 a.m. Initially, the small group of marchers faced ridicule from bystanders and interruptions in the line of march because policemen refused to stop traffic at intersections. As the parade continued north up Broadway, however, it swelled in size as union after union fell into line from side streets. Jeers turned into cheers as the spectacle of labor solidarity grew more impressive. 
 Marchers held aloft signs that spoke to their pride as workers and to the fear that they were losing political power and economic standing: "To the Workers Should Belong All Wealth," "Strike With the Ballot," "Don't Smoke Cigars Without the Union Label" and "Eight Hours for a Legal Day's Work."
 Many wore their traditional work uniforms and aprons and walked behind wagons displaying their handwork. Others dressed in their holiday best.
 After moving up Fifth Avenue, past the mansions of tycoons like Vanderbilt and Morgan, the grand procession of 5,000 or more terminated at 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue. There participants boarded elevated trains that took them to Wendel's Elm Park at West 92nd Street for a huge picnic. By late afternoon upward of 25,000 people jammed the park to participate in the festivities and consume copious amounts of food and beer. Members of craft unions gathered under banners put up throughout the park. Several bands played while speaker after speaker held forth from stages and soapboxes. 
 Thrilled with the success of their first effort, Central Labor Union leaders staged a second Labor Day the following year and drew even more participants. In 1884 the organization officially designated the first Monday in September as the annual Labor Day, calling upon workers to "Leave your benches, leave your shops, join in the parade and attend the picnic." Upwards of 20,000 marched that year, including a contingent of African-American workers. The first women marched in 1885. 
 WITH such an impressive start, the tradition of an annual Labor Day holiday quickly gained popularity across the country. By 1886 Labor Day had become a national event. Some 20,000 workers marched in Manhattan, and 10,000 more in Brooklyn, while 25,000 turned out in Chicago and 15,000 in Boston. Politicians took notice, and in 1887 five states, including New York, passed laws making Labor Day a state holiday. Seven years later, President Grover Cleveland signed into law a measure establishing a Labor Day holiday for federal workers. 
 Labor Day caught on quickly among Gilded Age workers because, unlike the traditional forms of labor activism -- like striking and picketing, or civic holidays commemorating victories in war -- it drew together workers for the purposes of celebration. As P.J. McGuire later wrote of the parade: "No festival of martial glory of warrior's renown is this; no pageant pomp of warlike conquest.... It is a demonstration of fraternity and the harbinger of a better age, a more chivalrous time, when labor shall be best honored and well rewarded."
 In the 20th century, Labor Day parades grew into spectacles of pride and power. The high point came in 1961 when 200,000 workers marched up Fifth Avenue behind the grand marshal, Mayor Robert Wagner, passing reviewing stand dignitaries that included Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, Senator Jacob K. Javits and Harry S. Truman. But the strength of organized labor demonstrated by that parade was already being eroded by the emergence of the service economy, globalization and a political climate often hostile to unions. 
 By the late 1990's fewer than 15 percent of American workers belonged to unions, down from a peak of 39 percent, and Labor Day parades disappeared in many cities. Many that survived, like New York City's, were moved to the weekend after Labor Day so people could enjoy a final three-day summer weekend of recreation.
 Still, many concerns that inspired the first Labor Day persist. Public distrust of corporations has spiked in recent years as a result of scandals in accounting and campaign finance and huge payouts to departing executives. Polls indicate that more and more Americans are worried about job security, health care costs and pension funding. Whether it all ultimately leads Americans to "Strike With the Ballot" remains to be seen. In the meantime Labor Day will presumably endure, an annual reminder of battles won and battles yet to be joined.

HEADLINE: A French Roadblock to Free Trade 

 BODY:
French farmers and government officials are fond of saying that the word "culture" is contained within the term "agriculture" for a reason. Farming is a way of life, the French argue, which governments are entitled to protect from the impact of "mindless trade liberalization" in a way that they ought not protect, say, refrigerator manufacturers. The French have a strong attachment to the ideal of the bucolic countryside, and a change in agricultural policy can be blown up into a threat to national identity.
 Those attitudes are important because they make France the leading supporter of the European Union's costly protectionist agricultural policy, and the major opponent of any serious change. That intransigence hurts developing countries, where farmers often find themselves competing with the artificially low prices of subsidized European produce that gets dumped on the international market. 
 As members of the World Trade Organization meet in Cancun, Mexico, next month, they'll be trying to overcome French protectionism that threatens to stall momentum toward expanding global trade. Great Britain, the Netherlands and some Scandinavian countries tend to be more open to change -- something that is not surprising because they pay in more to the European farm support system than they take out. (American trade negotiators support reducing subsidies and trade barriers on agriculture -- though their sentiments are not always shared by the farm lobby in Congress.)
Europe's protectionism stems from the Continent's political determination to sustain agriculture even when it makes little economic sense. European farms are, on average, far smaller than those in the United States -- the European Union has more than three times as many farms even though it has only about one-third as much cultivated farmland. The idea of bigger farms frightens the French, just like the idea of depopulated farming communities. But it is possible to advance some of the more sensible goals of Europe's agriculture policy, like land conservation and environmentalism, without losing touch with reality. Europe loses about 3 percent of its farming population a year, and more consolidation, in the form of larger-scale farming and an abandonment of absurdly inefficient production, is inevitable. And while there is no question that Europe has a right, even an obligation, to spend money on rural development and the protection of open space, it is not sensible to believe that every village that was inhabited in Charlemagne's day must be sustained. Moreover, Europe's common agricultural policy in its present form does not always advance the humble family farmers often pointed to in its defense. Larger corporate agricultural interests get a disproportionate share of farm aid, giving Europeans who pay for the subsidies the worst of both worlds. And the current subsidies actually often hurt the environment by promoting overproduction.
A sensible compromise would provide government support for farmers who protect land from development and maintain high environmental standards. But it would not pay farmers to grow crops they couldn't sell under normal circumstances and dump the result on the global market, driving prices down too low for poor countries to make a profit on their own exports. The European Commission recently moved in that direction. It proposed reforms to the common agricultural policy that would stop linking farmers' subsidies to the amount they produce. But farmers across Europe hated the idea. "We don't want to get checks simply because we live somewhere remote and are nice people," said Franz-Josef Feiter, who heads the Committee of Agricultural Organizations in the European Union, the main farm lobby in Brussels. "Ours are industrialized societies with high wages and we must assure similarly good wages for our farmers." 
France led the fight against the commission's reform and, with the help of German allies, was able to water down the final deal announced in June. Now, on the eve of the W.T.O. gathering in Cancun, European and American trade officials are negotiating the details of a common approach to reducing their harmful restraints to trade in farm goods. If this effort is to succeed, France must come to terms with the fact that at the very least, the time has come to renounce the dumping of any subsidized farm products on world markets, and to open its domestic market to imports from poor nations, free of any tariffs or quotas.

Labor Day: Time for Pink Slips

BYLINE:  By HUBERT B. HERRING

 BODY:
 Labor Day means that employers are about to roll up their corporate sleeves and put the jobless masses back to work, right? On the contrary, alas. If history is a faithful guide, as it sometimes is, bosses are even now sharpening their knives. 
 For the past eight years, the September-to-December period has averaged 25 percent more job cuts a month than the rest of the year -- and 36 percent more than in the summer months -- according to a survey by the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Why? Employers are putting finishing touches on the next year's budgets, meaning payrolls can suffer. So John A. Challenger, the firm's chief executive, has this advice: Don't slack off, especially now. You don't want to look expendable. HUBERT B. HERRING

HEADLINE: Policy Lobotomy Needed 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
No one can say with any certainty who was behind the bombings at the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad and the Shiite holy place in Najaf, but here is what you can say about them: They are incredibly sick and incredibly smart.
 With one bomb at the U.N. office, they sent a warning to every country that is considering joining the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq: Even the U.N. is not safe here, so your troops surely won't be. They also stoked some vicious finger-pointing within the Western alliance. And with the bomb Friday in Najaf, they may have threatened the most pleasant surprise about post-Saddam Hussein Iraq: the absence of bloodletting between the three main ethnic groups -- Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. After the Najaf bombing, Shiites started blaming Sunnis, and Shiites started blaming each other. 
 If you think we don't have enough troops in Iraq now -- which we don't -- wait and see if the factions there start going at each other. America would have to bring back the draft to deploy enough troops to separate the parties. In short, we are at a dangerous moment in Iraq. We cannot let sectarian violence explode. We cannot go on trying to do this on the cheap. And we cannot succeed without more Iraqi and allied input.
But the White House and Pentagon have been proceeding as if it's business as usual. It is no wonder that some of the people closest to what is happening are no longer sitting quiet. The gutsy Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, acting on his own, told reporters last week that the U.S. would consider a new U.N. resolution that would put U.S. forces in Iraq under U.N. authority -- which is the precondition for key allies to send troops. And Paul Bremer, who oversees Iraq's reconstruction, told The Washington Post that it was going to cost "several tens of billions" to rebuild Iraq. Both men were telling the American people truths that should have come from the White House.
Our Iraq strategy needs an emergency policy lobotomy. President Bush needs to shift to a more U.N.-friendly approach, with more emphasis on the Iraqi Army (the only force that can effectively protect religious sites in Iraq and separate the parties), and with more input from Secretary of State Colin Powell and less from the "we know everything and everyone else is stupid" civilian team running the Pentagon.
There is no question that we would benefit from a new U.N. mandate that puts U.S. forces in Iraq under a stronger U.N. umbrella. It would buy us and our Iraqi allies more legitimacy, as well as help, and legitimacy buys time and time is what this is going to take. "Other nations are prepared to help, but they do not want to join what is perceived as an American 'occupation,' " Secretary General Kofi Annan told me. "If the forces in Iraq are put under a U.N. mandate, they can still be commanded by an American, like in Bosnia, but it will be perceived differently and provide the legitimacy for othersto join."
But this will not be a cure-all. Countries are not exactly lining up to send their troops into harm's way in Iraq. So, the only way we get a big troop increase quickly is for the Pentagon to reverse its awful decision to disband (and unemploy) the Iraqi Army -- most of whom refused to fight for Saddam in the first place. We should be going to Iraqi colonels and offering to pay them to rebuild their units. They can prune out the bad guys.
Also, the hard part of any new U.N. mandate will be what to do with Mr. Bremer, who, up to now, has done a tough job well. No serious allies are going to send forces to Iraq just to be under U.S. military command. They will demand a voice in shaping the political future of Iraq, which is right now the exclusive role of Mr. Bremer, reporting to the Pentagon. If the U.N. is brought into the political rebuilding of Iraq, a way must be found to tightly define its role so that we don't have 15 chefs in the kitchen. That would make a mess. Maybe the solution is to have the Iraqi Governing Council spell out to the U.N. what political role it should play -- where it should stop and start.
I don't know what Mr. Bush has been doing on his vacation, but I know what the country has been doing: starting to worry. People are connecting the dots -- the exploding deficit, the absence of allies in Iraq, the soaring costs of the war and the mounting casualties. People want to stop hearing about why winning in Iraq is so important and start seeing a strategy for making it happen at a cost the country can sustain.

HEADLINE: Ferry Company To Raise Fares On Its Routes Across Hudson 

BYLINE:  By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
New York Waterway will raise fares tomorrow on its ferry routes between Manhattan and New Jersey, the company announced last week.
 The cost of monthly passes between New Jersey ports and Midtown Manhattan and the financial district will go up by 15 percent. 
A 10-trip pass will increase by as much as 13 percent. One-way fares will not increase. 
 A monthly pass between Port Imperial in Weehawken, N.J., to West 38th Street, for instance, will increase to $172 from $150. The price of a 10-trip pass between Port Imperial and the World Financial Center will increase to $68 from $60.
The fare increases were first reported in The Star-Ledger of Newark on Friday.
According to New York Waterway's corporate Web site, the fares are being raised to offset several capital improvements the company has recently made. The ferry company, based in Weehawken, has increased its ferry fleet by five vessels and its bus fleet by 15 vehicles so far this year, the Web site said. The company has also improved the docks and terminals at all of its landing sites.
In addition, fuel and insurance costs have more than doubled since 2001, the Web site said. The company has also experienced "significant ridership losses" on some routes because of "slowdowns in the economy," the site added.
The company expects further reductions in ridership when train service is restored to the PATH station at the World Trade Center site.
On Tuesday, another ferry operator, New York Water Taxi, will take over East River ferry service that New York Waterway is discontinuing because of too few customers. The service provides landings at East 90th Street, East 34th Street and Pier 11 in Manhattan and Hunters Point in Queens.

HEADLINE: State Cutbacks Put Schools And Federal Law to the Test 

BYLINE:  By SAM DILLON

DATELINE: OKLAHOMA CITY, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
Angela Houston, the principal of Eisenhower Elementary School, spent this week hunkered down in her office here phoning unemployed teachers, trying to rebuild her staff after a dozen instructors lost their jobs in a state budget crisis last spring.
 But even if Ms. Houston can hire teachers for all her classrooms, she worries about her school's morale. "The layoffs brought a big letdown," she said. 
 Dozens of other Oklahoma City schools were also reeling from the financial turmoil that forced the closing of seven schools and the dismissal of 600 teachers at the end of the last school year. 
As children return to classrooms, many of the nation's 90,000 public schools are, as in Oklahoma City, feeling battered and worn down. Most states have reacted to declining tax revenues by trimming education spending, setting the stage for one of the most austere school years in memory.
In Alabama, where a budget crisis has left 38 of the state's 129 school systems on the verge of bankruptcy, Birmingham closed nine schools before the fall term began this month. Boston closed five schools and eliminated 1,000 jobs, including 400 teaching positions. Teachers lost jobs in cities like Toledo, Ohio; Norwich, Conn.; and Vista, Calif. In New Port Richey, Fla., school officials closed a popular 29-year-old science field trip center.
"School finances across the country are teetering on horrendous," said Michael Griffith, an analyst for the Education Commission of the States, a research group in Denver.
Many schools are raising revenues in new ways, charging students to participate in sports, plays, band or other activities that were once free. The Los Alamitos District in Orange County, Calif., is urging parents to make a $40 donation for each day a student misses classes, to compensate for state aid forfeited through the absence, David Hatton, a spokesman, said.
If austerity is challenging parents and educators at schools across America, the new term also appears likely to pose a critical test for the education law, called No Child Left Behind, which President Bush has made a centerpiece of his domestic agenda. Mr. Bush developed its central concept -- using standardized tests to hold schools accountable for student achievement -- as governor of Texas in the 1990's, when the economy was booming. Flush with tax revenues, Texas sent squads of experts to schools labeled as failing to help them sort out their educational program.
But the education law, which seeks to replicate Mr. Bush's Texas experiment nationally, is taking force in an economic downturn, and a fierce debate is under way about whether the federal government will provide enough help to schools the law identifies as failing, or simply pass the costs of the law on to the states.
"We believe the law is amply funded," Dan Langan, a Department of Education spokesman, said. "There's more money than ever before to achieve the intent of the law." 
But legislators in several states have introduced proposals for those states to opt out of the federal law if its costs are not fully financed by the federal government. By doing so, however, they would also lose all federal aid to low-income schools.
The National Education Association, the teachers union, said in an August newsletter that the nation's school districts were grappling with "the worst budget shortfalls since World War II."
"It will be impossible for our public schools to meet the strict demands of the new federal education law if vital school services continue to be cut across the country," the union said. 
The N.E.A. is preparing a lawsuit against the Department of Education that will challenge what it terms "the gigantic financial gap" between the law's costs and its financing, Bob Chanin, the union's lawyer, said.
James Guthrie, a professor of public policy at Vanderbilt University, put the squeeze in historical perspective. Public school spending has risen constantly over recent decades, Professor Guthrie said, from a national yearly average of about $1,000 per pupil in 1970 to an average of about $4,000 today, expressed in 1970 dollars. "This is just a slowdown," Professor Guthrie said. "School spending has reached a plateau, but in a year or two the trajectory will continue upward."
Whether his forecast is accurate or not, school systems must now contend with the demands of the federal law, under which every racial and demographic group in each school must score higher on standardized English and math tests to make "adequate yearly progress." 
If any group fails to advance for two consecutive years, a school is labeled "needing improvement," a euphemism for what educators used to call failing, and must offer parents the option of transferring students to higher-scoring schools or paying for tutoring if they stay. Schools labeled as needing improvement for several years face escalating sanctions that can include removal of the staff.
It is an accountability system with so many ways for disqualifying schools that many prominent educators fear the law will, within its first few years, subject the vast majority of public schools to sanctions. If that happens, these educators say, it may be impossible to provide so many schools with the special help they need.
These fears gained strength this month, when officials in many states identified large numbers of schools that had failed to make adequate yearly progress, or had already been labeled as needing improvement.
Chicago authorities said 365 of the city's 600 schools were labeled as needing improvement, obligating the city to offer transfers, and demonstrating the challenges awaiting cities with large numbers of failing schools. Superintendent Arne Duncan said there was limited alternative space, but the city still sent out letters to 240,000 parents offering a chance to compete for about 1,000 seats at higher-performing schools.
In California, about 3,200 of the 7,100 schools subject to the law failed to make adequate yearly progress, and 1,135 were "needing improvement." In Florida, about 2,500 of the state's 3,000 schools failed to make adequate yearly progress, and 48 were rated as needing improvement. 
In Pennsylvania, about 1,250 of 2,800 schools failed to make adequate yearly progress, and 171 were labeled as needing improvement. Many schools were labeled as needing improvement in Delaware, Georgia and dozens of other states.
Here in Oklahoma City, the authorities said 37 of the city's 70 elementary and middle schools had failed to make adequate yearly progress, and 11 schools were labeled as needing improvement, including Eisenhower.
Bob Moore, the new superintendent, said one of his priorities would be to help schools like Eisenhower meet the law's requirements. He said he would draw on his experience as school superintendent in Amarillo, Tex., in the 1990's, where he participated in Governor Bush's drive to raise school achievement across Texas.
"I give George Bush credit for providing so much support to the Texas schools rated low-performing," Mr. Moore said. "Kids' needs were not being met, so we had to provide services, and that meant money. But today we're living different financial times."
The recent cuts in the Oklahoma City system have been hugely disruptive, he said.
"It's hard for us now just to keep the grass mowed and the floors shined at our schools," Mr. Moore said. 
Nowhere, perhaps, was that clearer than at Eisenhower, a low-slung brick building on a barren prairie, many of whose students come from low-income apartments. The school was labeled as needing improvement three years ago, and in the last school year it received $161,000 in federal money for tutoring and other efforts to raise scores. Yet the chaos that accompanied the Oklahoma budget crisis obliterated whatever progress the federal money might have bought.
Last spring, Ms. Houston said, she worked with her staff to prepare the 562 students for standardized tests. But in the critical days before the tests were administered, the city sent layoff notices to half her teachers, provoking a crisis atmosphere that she said hurt student performance on the exams.
"The teachers tried," Ms. Houston said, "but when you've just been told you don't have a job, it plays on your psyche."

HEADLINE: Eat, Drink and Be Seen, for Tomorrow Ends the Saratoga Season 

BYLINE:  By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. 

 BODY:
It was getting on toward midnight, and the energy in the piano bar at Siro's, a restaurant in the shadow of the Saratoga Race Course had jumped about an octave. Older couples did a nimble foxtrot amid a crush of men in madras plaid who were busy offering drinks.
 Outside in the "yard," a few people lingered under crisp white tents where earlier, throngs, fresh from the races, listened to live rock and downed raw oysters and clams. In the cool, softly lighted dining room, high rollers were done tucking into $48 veal chops, and a table of young women dressed in strappy dresses compared very sparkly, very large diamond rings. 
 It was just another night at Siro's, but it was special nonetheless. Perhaps that's because there are so few of them.
A Saratoga institution and stamping ground for equestrian-minded magnates, grandes dames, dandies and the occasional miscreant, Siro's is open during the racing season only, a six-week sprint that turns this city into a delirious blur of betting and revelry. In an often repeated line once uttered by a waiter, Siro's is where "Goodfellas" meets "Gone With the Wind."
"It's definitely the place to be seen after the track, if you're anyone who's anyone," said a spokeswoman for the Saratoga County Chamber of Commerce, Annamaria Dalton, setting aside her vow of impartiality for a moment to convey the restaurant's import.
This year there seems to be more jostling for tables than usual. Despite torrents of rain in the early weeks, the racetrack, now in its 135th season, is expecting this summer to be the biggest in history, with more than a million visitors. The interest is no doubt fed by the bestseller "Seabiscuit" by Laura Hillenbrand about the famous 1930's thoroughbred, and the movie he inspired.
Siro's is behind the track on Lincoln Avenue in an unassuming white clapboard house, bathed in the soft blue light of an old neon sign. The restaurant has been party central during the racing season ever since the 1930's. That is when Jimmy Siro, a maitre d'hotel at the Waldorf-Astoria, bought a little Italian restaurant, changed the name and welcomed his well-heeled Manhattan customers up for some postrace carousing. 
Much has changed, of course. But broad-brimmed straw hats trimmed with long feathers still maneuver through the dining room, where the old New York families once had regular tables. Some still drop by. "This was their little room," said the chef and co-owner, Tom J. Dillon, referring to the Rockefellers, Astors and Whitneys. "Mary Lou Whitney ate here last week."
Mr. Dillon, dressed in a peach linen shirt that perfectly matched the restaurant's interior, is one of five partners who have together owned Siro's since the mid-1980's. The rest of the year, Mr. Dillon oversees three dozen restaurants at racetracks and golf courses around the country. In truth, Siro's doesn't completely close for 46 weeks. It is shuttered in January, February and March. It handles about 15 private parties in the fall and five weddings in the spring and early summer.
Historically, Siro's pulled waiters from Washington, New York City and Boston, where the restaurants were "completely barren in August," Mr. Dillon said. Now, the waiters come east primarily from Las Vegas for the season at Siro's, returning in the fall. Several other staff members, including some chefs, work in St. Croix in the winter.
Under Mr. Dillon's toque blanche, the Siro's kitchen has received wide acclaim. The Los Angeles Times called Siro's the most famous trackside restaurant in America.
'Every vegetable served at Siro's is in the ground in the morning," said Mr. Dillon, who once owned restaurants from the Hamptons to Maui. "We raise our own lamb in Vermont. We dry-age our own beef."
Dinner is not cheap, averaging $100 a person (a temperate person, that is). The least expensive bottle of red on the wine list is $30. More than half the wines are priced at more than $90 a bottle.
But fans of the restaurant, who cover the spectrum from horse trainers, owners and "trackies" to movie stars, politicians and socialites, apparently feel it is worth it. "Siro's is the headquarters of Saratoga," said Bruce Blythe III, a lawyer from Louisville, Ky., who lost $100 at the track one day recently and kept his reservation anyway. "After the last race everybody comes here."
Mr. Blythe, who once owned a racehorse who "wasn't any good," had arrived in town for a long weekend with nine buddies. One was Dr. J. Cotton Shallcross, a gastroenterologist originally from Louisville.
"For the observant horseplayer, it's a religious pilgrimage," Dr. Shallcross said of the trip to Saratoga. The group was reluctant to eat at Siro's because it is so expensive, he said. But one friend insisted, and so they settled for a 10 o'clock seating.
Snagging a prime reservation -- the second seating during Travers Stakes week, say -- is akin to winning a trifecta. The phone starts ringing the day after the restaurant closes for the season with reservation requests for the following year, Mr. Dillon said. (This year, the restaurant will serve its last dinner tomorrow, Labor Day, the final day of races.)
But Siro's does not start accepting reservations until Kentucky Derby Day, the first Saturday in May. "We're 60 percent sold out before the season opens," Mr. Dillon said.
"It's a world-famous restaurant for six weeks," said Tommy Porsche, a 49-year-old sports handicapper from Schenectady, holding a plastic cup of red wine ($6.50) in the "yard," which resembled an Ivy League frat party of two or three decades ago. "It's the best of the best. I'll eat here four or five times this summer."
For the owners, keeping the restaurant open for the racing season has proved profitable, creating a certain mystique and ensuring a stampede of would-be diners. A third seating is added during especially busy times like the weeks of the Travers and the annual Yearling Sales. "We can turn away 100 dinners a night," Mr. Dillon said. 
During the season, the 130-seat restaurant serves about 9,000 dinners, not to mention all those raw oysters, he said. It did not hurt business when, in the mid-1990's, the New York Racing Association decided to extend the traditional monthlong season in August to six weeks.
"It's an economic anomaly that works for us," said Thomas A. Anderson, a partner. "As good a location as it is now, it's that bad in December."

HEADLINE: For Two Battered Economies, Glimmers of Hope 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
With one lost economic decade, the glitter has gone from Japan's name. Headlines ask: "Has Taiwan Caught 'Japan Disease?' " and "German Banks: Turning Japanese?"
 But now some of the sparkle may be back for the world's second largest economy. 
 For the last six quarters, Japan's economy has expanded, leading to forecasts of 2 percent growth rates for this year and next. Company profits are up, business spending is up, bankruptcies are down, payrolls are expanding and the Nikkei stock index has increased 36 percent since April. 
When Treasury Secretary John W. Snow arrived here today on the first leg of an Asian tour, he found a country experiencing growth in a time of deflation.
"Japan's economic fundamentals have finally changed for the better," Barclays Capital says in a report that forecasts "a shift to a permanently higher-growth trajectory."
While Japanese economists tend to be gloomier, the good economic news is scattering opposition to the re-election of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi at the Sept. 20 convention of the governing Liberal Democratic Party. 
"I have an impression that brighter signs are emerging gradually amid the severe conditions," Mr. Koizumi said Friday on a radio program about the economy.
A strong victory at the party convention next month could prompt Mr. Koizumi to call national elections six months early, in November.
"If he wins in a landslide, and if he wins the general election, he will have a strong mandate and a second honeymoon," Takatoshi Ito, a Tokyo University economics professor, said this week. "I hope he takes that opportunity to carry out more reforms." 
Many economists say Mr. Koizumi has done little to reform the economy since coming to power in April 2001. They say Japan is merely embarking on its third cyclical upswing in a decade, pulled by new growth from its No. 1 export market, the United States.
"Optimism has emerged in the United States, and Japan's export sector has responded," said Takashi Kiuchi, an economist here.
In Japan's globally competitive export trade, which accounts for about 10 percent of the economy here, investments are taking place again as sales soar for digital cameras, camera cellphones and flat-screen televisions.
This rebound has caught the eye of foreign investors, who have pushed the Nikkei Index up 35.9 percent since late April, when it hit 20-year lows. The index is back where it was a year ago, while Japanese investors have watched from the sidelines. 
"Japan was cheap, stocks had fallen back to level of 1983," Jesper Koll, Merrill Lynch's chief Japan economist, said of the market's fall last spring. "At that time, Japan economy was 300 trillion yen. Today Japan's economy is a 500 trillion yen," or $4.3 trillion.
But while Americans are dazzled by imports from Japan's top companies, the other 90 percent of the economy is the hands of protected, often tradition-bound companies that, according to a McKinsey & Company report, have productivity rates less than two-thirds that of their American counterparts.
In Japan, economic complacency and stagnation became endemic in recent years. The nation's economy is heavily dependent on consumer spending, which has lagged as a result of a population whose average age is increasing, economic insecurities and deflationary expectations.
To end deflation, the Bank of Japan embarked last spring on an unorthodox program of injecting yen into the economy: buying company stocks, extending loans to small- and medium-size enterprises, printing more money and paying cash for 38 percent of Treasury bond emissions -- a level seen in recent years only in Turkey, Venezuela and Argentina.
This succeeded in lowering July's deflation rate, to 0.2 percent, the lowest in more than two years. Although prices have dropped for 46 months in a row, Mr. Koll, a self-confessed optimist, wrote an essay last week titled "Sayonara Deflation." 
Deflation levels dictate Japan's real growth figures. In nominal terms, Japan's economic output numbers are flat. When adjusted for deflation, however, real economic growth is evident. Analysts have different views of what is happening.
"Japan has made the transition from having a bloated high-growth corporate sector to an efficient shrinking one," Peter Tasker, Japan strategist for Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, wrote in June. 
On the other hand, Taisuke Tanaka, a Japan economist for Credit Suisse First Boston, wrote in July, "Japan now appears to have entered a second 'lost decade.' "
While economists argue over the present, the future is clouded by a population whose average age is rising and mountains of debt. 
With Japan's work force shrinking by 0.5 percent a year, the only way its economy will be able to expand in the future is through productivity increases. Demographers forecast that the size of Japan's population, currently at 127 million, will drop by half during this century. 
On the private debt side, estimates of the size of bad loans held by banks here range from the official figure of $370 billion to nearly triple that amount. Not only are the banks reluctant to pull plugs on companies, but the government is reluctant to pull plugs on banks. 
On the public debt side, Japan's political class, top-heavy with men in their 60's and 70's, has few qualms about buying social peace today by running up whopping fiscal bills they will never have to pay. Japan's ratio of government debt to gross domestic product is estimated at 150 percent, the highest of major world economies. The American ratio is around 65 percent. 
"In five more years, it will be close to 200 percent, and that will be intolerable," said Mr. Ito of Tokyo University. "Then, something very unpleasant will happen -- hyperinflation, a major devaluation, a major tax increase. The standard of living will decline one way or another. It will be quite a shock."

HEADLINE: A Seeping Tanker Turns Spain's Beaches Into an Oily Sandbox 

BYLINE:  By DALE FUCHS

DATELINE: MADRID, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
Instead of hunting for seashells this summer, many bathers along Spain's northern coast have been watching out for small blobs of oil hidden in the sand, messy reminders of the Prestige oil spill last fall.
 The Prestige, a single-hulled tanker, sank in November 130 miles off the craggy coast of Galicia, polluting the richest shellfish beds in Spain, putting thousands out of work and covering more than 350 miles of rocks and coves with foul-smelling sludge. It has leaked 63,000 tons of viscous fuel oil, Deputy Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced this week, almost 60 percent more than previous estimates. 
 A large-scale cleanup effort has scraped, scooped and sifted away nearly all of the so-called black tides, officials said. But tiny black splotches of heavy fuel oil still wash in with the tide and sully the sands from A Coruna on Spain's northwestern tip to the French border. 
"You have to look where you walk or you'll have black stains all over your feet," said Esther Esteban, 35, who accidentally stepped on a galleta, or cookie, as Spaniards have named the chunks of tar that wash up on the beaches near Santander. 
The oil blobs come from pockets of residue pushed by sea currents into the Bay of Biscay, and then float below the surface until they reach the beaches. Together, the gluey pellets could add up to 3,000 tons, said Michel Girin, director of Cedre, a French marine research institute tracking the oil spill. 
A cleanup team of 4,000 workers, many of them fishermen out of work since the disaster, try to clear each morning's mess before vacationers hit the beaches. But the blobs still snare beachcombers, and lifeguards and officials at resort towns like San Sebastian have been handing out cotton balls and sunflower oil to sunbathers to wipe off the tar.
Sticky toes are a trivial problem compared with the damage done since the Prestige sank on Nov. 19. A report by the private, Galicia-based Pedro Barrie de la Maza Foundation equated the disaster with the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska. The study, by 40 Spanish scientists and economists, estimated that the Prestige spill killed more than 250,000 sea birds and idled 30,000 fishing industry workers, and speculated the cleanup would cost $2 billion. 
Although a 350-mile fishing ban was lifted on June 2, biologists predicted that marine life would suffer for at least 10 years, as toxic chemicals poisoned plankton, fish eggs and other small organisms at the bottom of the food chain.
This month, robots working two miles beneath the water's surface finished sealing the remaining fissures in the Prestige's hull, slowing the leakage from 185 gallons a day to about 5 gallons. An effort to extract the estimated 13,000 tons of oil left inthe sunken ship will not start until May, and could cost up to $100 million.

HEADLINE: Poor Nations Can Purchase Cheap Drugs Under Accord 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization agreed today to give poor nations greater access to inexpensive life-saving medicine by altering international trade rules.
 After several days of nonstop negotiations and speeches, the trade organization reached unanimous agreement this morning, just as its meeting was concluding, after speeches by several African delegates who said such an agreement could save millions of lives. 
 Under the accord, poor countries will be able to import generic versions of expensive patented medicines, buying them from countries like India and Brazil without running afoul of trade laws protecting patent rights.
African countries and their supporters in nonprofit health groups have been campaigning for such an agreement for years, saying that moral and political arguments outweigh commercial considerations in the face of epidemics like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. 
"This will absolutely save millions of lives that would be lost without it," said Faizel Ismail, South Africa's permanent representative at the World Trade Organization, in an interview from Geneva.
The breakthrough came earlier this week when the United States agreed to the original proposal it had rejected last December. 
Backed by the powerful American pharmaceutical lobby, the Bush administration had prevented the trade organization from adopting the measure, saying it should be restricted to a handful of diseases and limited to certain countries. The European Union and Switzerland, the other two delegations representing advanced pharmaceutical companies, had accepted the proposal. 
Nations from the developing world pointed out that without an agreement, there was little hope for success at new talks in the current trade round scheduled to begin in Cancun, Mexico, in September. 
This week the United States accepted the original proposal, but included the demand that such generic medicines could be imported to cure any life-threatening disease, so long as it was a public health emergency.
"The final piece of the jigsaw has fallen into place," said Supachai Panitchpakdi, director general of the trade organization. "It proves once and for all that the organization can handle humanitarian as well as trade concerns."
Several delegates said they were moved by the speeches made by Mr. Panitchpakdi as well as African delegates who argued that 2.4 million Africans had already died from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis since the agreement was first rejected last December.
The United States, however, only agreed to the accord after it won acceptance of an additional statement setting out measures to ensure that countries would not take advantage of it and reap commercial profits rather than meet public health needs.
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, said in a statement that the Bush administration, "working with other W.T.O. members and our pharmaceutical industry, has strived to bridge the many differences and sought to develop with others constructive ideas about how to move forward."
Several public health groups said, though, that the new statement essentially doomed the accord by encasing it with enough bureaucratic red tape to discourage poor nations from importing the drugs.
"Today's deal was designed to offer comfort to the U.S. and the Western pharmaceutical industry," said Ellen 't Hoen, of Doctors Without Borders, in a statement released from Paris. "Unfortunately, it offers little comfort for poor patients. Global patent rules will continue to drive up the price of medicines."
The countries most affected by the agreement were in the forefront of the lobbying effort this week. India and Brazil, which manufacture cheap generic medicines, and South Africa and Kenya, nations that need them, pleaded with delegates late into the evening last night.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America issued a statement today praising the agreement, saying "now that this issue has been resolved, governments and the public health community can concentrate on the immense practical problems of delivering needed medicines to patients in the world's poorest countries."

HEADLINE: Potholes and Promises Line an Afghan Highway 

BYLINE:  By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: ON THE KABUL-KANDAHAR ROAD, Afghanistan, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
Camels chew on thorn bushes along the highway, oblivious to the traffic in front of them. This road is one of the great obstacle courses of Afghanistan, choked with trucks creaking and jangling over the ruts, and jeeps and taxis making their way through the clouds of dust.
 It is perhaps the most important highway in the country, and a key to Afghanistan's future security and unity. It links the Tajik-dominated capital, Kabul, to the Pashtun city of Kandahar in the south, once the city of the country's kings and later the spiritual home of the Taliban. 
 Residents of Kandahar remember that in the 1970's they could drive north to Kabul for the evening to catch a movie. But for two decades now, the 305-mile stretch has presented travelers with a bone-crushing, 15-hour journey that has done as much as anything to divide the Persian-speaking north of the country from the Pashtun south. 
From Kabul, the trip begins with some 28 miles of paved road built by the Taliban, extending to the first town of Maidan Shahr in Wardak Province. From there a Turkish-American-Afghan company financed with American money has started work and so far has paved five and a half miles more.
After that the condition goes downhill, from recently graded dirt to a roller coaster of dips and potholes to a final few miles of asphalt just outside the city of Kandahar.
Although the road is under repair, its crumbled condition is a reminder of Afghanistan's enormous obstacles -- the painfully slow reconstruction and the growing doubts of a population that foreign powers will keep their promises of assistance and that the current Afghan government will prove better than ones in the past.
"People have been thinking for nearly two years that the Americans, and not just Americans, but hundreds of foreign troops, came to rebuild the country," said Hajji Baz Muhammad, district chief of Shah Juy, a town north of Kandahar. "But now the people are thinking they just came for their own ends, because they have done nothing to rebuild.
"The people are thinking, 'If they came to rebuild, then we say welcome,' " he added. " 'But if they came to occupy our country and oppress us, we don't like that, and they will become our enemies.' " The same refrain is repeated by farmers, taxi and truck drivers, police officers, soldiers and shopkeepers the length of the road. 
This is the Taliban's argument -- that the United States never intended to rebuild, but just wanted to occupy a Muslim country, and so should be expelled. Not everyone sides with the Taliban, but almost everyone complains that until now, international aid has been almost invisible. 
But, to look at this highway, no one can deny that some rebuilding has started. Sections have been parceled to different construction companies for repair. There are at least five camps along the road, run by Indian, Turkish and Afghan companies, with cabins, crushing plants, piles of gravel and stones, and huge colorful machines called aggregate separators, trucks, bulldozers, diggers and rollers. 
Surveyors in bright orange and yellow caps stand with their instruments on hillsides, and road workers wave red flags to slow the traffic along the road's smoother sections.
Over half of the road has been graded, and on those stretches traffic is speeding along, kicking up loose stones with glee. Engineers say they hope to put down asphalt on the whole road this year, and next year to add more layers of asphalt and to repair some of the bombed bridges.
The first few hours from Kabul bring travelers to the ancient city of Ghazni, with its minarets and holy shrines. It is a ramshackle town far enough away from the capital to have a neglected provincial feel. Mechanics shops and gasoline stalls line the main route, and the city is swollen with homeless refugees.
In Ghazni, local officials have greeted the belated construction work with tangible relief, hoping it will swing support behind the government and away from the Taliban. "It's organized and going well," said Gen. Shaista Turabi, the police chief of Ghazni Province, the third of five provinces that the road traverses. "People are very happy about the road, prices are already coming down, on transport, and on food and fruit. This is a big change, because people are very happy with the government."
The taxi and truck drivers are overwhelmingly enthusiastic. "We were hoping they would build it, because they did a bit of work last year, and because a lot of trucks and cars have overturned on this road," said Nawab Khan, a 22-year-old truck driver from Ghazni, who was making the six-day drive from the western town of Herat to Kabul with a cargo of Indonesian tea. "Now it is better, things are getting good." Compared with the Taliban years, business is much better, he said.
But this southeast region is still insecure because of the Taliban threat, the United Nations has banned its staff from traveling along portions of the road, and some aid agencies have pulled out. Two Afghan Red Crescent workers were shot to death in the middle of August in Ghazni Province, in the latest attack on aid workers by suspected Taliban militants. Threats have started against the construction companies, and two rockets were fired at one of their camps recently.
The city of Ghazni, too, is not considered safe, but it has a working hospital and some wealth as a trading crossroads. Farther along, toward Kandahar, through desert where only thorn bushes grow and huge dust storms sometimes shroud the way ahead, the villages and towns are smaller, poorer and, because of the rough condition of the road, so cut off that few people can reach a hospital in an emergency. 
In Moqor, which is the halfway point between Kabul and Kandahar, aid workers are confident the repaired road will improve people's lives. "Can you believe it?" said Hamida Zafari, 28, a doctor who runs a clinic in Moqor. "I was just in Ghazni at 4 p.m. this afternoon and now I am here back home." What was usually an agonizing four-hour journey had just taken her an easy 90 minutes. The road, she said, would save lives. Pregnant women would be able to get to the hospital in Ghazni. In the past, if they had complications, they simply died at home, she said.
President Hamid Karzai pressed early for help rebuilding Afghanistan's roads, arguing that the repairs would allow traders and businesses to get started and the local economy to flourish. He won the backing of the departing American ambassador, Robert Finn, who gained support in Washington and the personal commitment of President Bush. The United States has ended up footing the bulk of bill, contributing $180 million so far, with Japan putting in $50 million and Saudi Arabia offering a loan of $30 million. But $70 million more must be raised to finish the road next year, said a Western aid official familiar with the project.
The plan came perilously close to disaster earlier this year when the Taliban carried out a series of armed attacks on mine-clearing organizations and on aid workers in the area. The shootings left one Afghan aid worker dead, and eight more wounded, three seriously.
The United Nations suspended all mine-removal work -- a crucial preliminary to the road construction -- in 10 provinces in southern and eastern Afghanistan in May.
As foreign aid workers also left, and the road project began to look like it might founder, the United States government stepped in once more. "We realized we needed to do something on security and we determined that the best way was to get the road patrolled constantly," the Western aid official said. The United States Agency for International Development is now paying, through the prime contractor, the American company Louis Berger, hundreds of Afghan police officers $5 a day to patrol the road at all times. The construction companies, too, have brought in security. Police officers seem to stand at the elbow of almost every road worker and mine clearer. 
Afghan officials insist that security has improved, but the police recently rounded up a gang of robbers and pursued carjackers into the next province. Lawbreakers are not all Taliban; some are simply men with guns, the officials say.
In farming villages all along the road, the cry is for water, for help to deepen wells, repair irrigation channels and build dams.
Farmers bringing their grain to the mill in the village called Abdul Aziz Kala in Zabul Province at the south end of the road, said the harvest this year had been poor, for lack of water. A four-year drought has not yet lifted in the south, and many springs and wells are dry.
"We did not even get enough wheat from the fields to feed the family, so how can we find the money to dig a deeper well," said Wali Muhammad, 17, who runs the family mill. 
Life is harsh and many families are going hungry, according to Abdul Majid Wasili, head of an Afghan aid agency, Coordination of Afghan Relief, in the town of Moqor. Some are abandoning their villages because of the drought, he said. The police chief in Ghazni said refugees had returned from Iran and Pakistan only to find their houses destroyed.
Even in the more prosperous villages closer to Kabul, where the fruit trees are heavy with golden apricots and green apples, some people are leaving the hills.
"There is no water; they have to make the three-hour journey every day with donkeys to the river here," said Ahmad Shah, 36, a fuel pump worker in the village of Shekhabad, an hour's drive from Kabul. "Nobody is helping them so many are leaving the village." 
Life along the road continues an age-old pattern in its rhythms and simplicity. Old men beg beside the road, covered in dust. Grave sites fill the hillsides, decorated with fluttering silk flags on tall poles to mark the resting place of martyrs. Farmers lie under brush shelters hiding from the blistering sun while they guard their melon fields from thieves.
Kuchis, the nomadic herders, are strewn across the desert landscape on either side of the route, pitching their goat-hair tents, already moving down from the central highlands to the warmer lowlands around Kandahar or in Pakistan for the winter.
"It is better now," said Bakhtiar Khan, 35, owner of 25 camels. "There is peace now and we can go easily up to the mountains." And now the road is being rebuilt.
"But we are poor people, and we just go on our way," he said. "Nothing has changed for us. But if it is built and it's good for Muslims, then let them build it."

HEADLINE: German Stocks Are Rising, but Jobs, So Far, Are Not 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: BERLIN, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
The reports have been terrible lately: the German deficit remains higher than allowed by the European Union; a disastrously high unemployment rate is expected to go higher still; exports, the engine of this country's economy, declined by 2.5 percent in the last quarter, and the recession, already three years old, continues.
 Yet, even though economic growth for this year is expected to be only a fraction above zero percent, German economists and commentators are daring to think that the worst is over. Germany is on a path to recovery, they say, from one of its worst postwar periods of economic stagnation. 
 "There seem to be some signs of hope," said Gustav-Adolf Horn, the lead forecaster at the German Institute for Economic Research. "The mood has improved; the stock market has recovered; and there is less insecurity internationally than before the Iraq war." 
But while there is suddenly a breath of optimism here -- Germany is no longer being called the sick man of Europe -- few believe that growth in the foreseeable future will reach the levels of the 1990's or that there is much hope for substantially more jobs for another year or so. 
"I think that the second half of this year will be better," said Gerhard Grebe, an economist and chief strategist in Frankfurt for Julius Bear, a private Swiss bank. "We will see a bottoming out of the economy and 2004 will then bring better growth of about 1.4 percent." 
But, he added: "This growth is still below our potential. It's still too low really to improve the labor market situation, so we'll have to wait longer, until growth gets to 2 percent before we'll see an improvement there." 
The German economy is the largest in Europe and the third largest in the world, after the United States and Japan. For much of the 90's, it expanded an average of 3 percent a year despite the enormous costs entailed when the western half of the country absorbed the eastern half. But the direct transfers of about $77 billion a year to the East that continue today -- about 4 percent of gross domestic product -- have had a serious effect on growth, Mr. Grebe said.
By 2000, economists and others say, several factors combined to push Germany's economy into the most dire situation of any major economy in Europe. Among them were problems in the banking industry, especially bad loans of the sort that brought several big Japanese banks to their knees. A slump in the construction industry was caused by enthusiastic overbuilding after unification in 1989. Over the three years of recession, the main German stock market index, the DAX, had lost nearly 70 percent of its value at its lowest point. 
Then, earlier this year, there was the international uncertainty over the Iraq war that Mr. Horn cited, which led to reduced consumer spending -- what Germans call Angstsparen, or fear-saving. At the same time, a rising euro weakened German exports. 
Unemployment, at more than 10 percent, is the most alarming and most talked-about consequence of the recession. That and a sense of drift have been at the heart of the political problems of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, whose approval rating fell below 30 percent, one of the lowest of any German leader. 
Since his re-election last fall, he has announced a package of politically risky changes, including cutbacks in the expensive social welfare system and an easing of the nation's strict labor market controls. But the measures will not go into effect for several years and will have little effect on the current economic picture, analysts say. 
In the meantime, his government has tried to avoid falling into even greater recession by essentially ignoring a central rule of the 12-nation Euro Zone that prohibits any member from running a public deficit greater than 3 percent of its gross domestic product. 
Several predictions issued last week indicate that Germany will continue to flout the 3 percent rule. 
Two months ago, the International Monetary Fund was warning of "a considerable danger of deflation" in Germany. But there is much less of that kind of talk now. Economists say that tax reforms have led to about $17 billion in relief for Germans in the last year and the euro's long rise against the dollar seems to be over. Analysts say that with a large number of the bad loans already written off, the worst is over for the banks. The DAX has surged, recovering about 30 percent of its lost value in recent weeks. 
The end of the war in Iraq has calmed Germans and increased consumer spending, which analysts like Mr. Grebe say will stimulate growth. 
"Positive signs are mounting," the weekly Die Zeit wrote last week. "Everything now depends on a factor that the forecasters cannot account for in their equations and formulas: the human factor." 
Some analysts here worry that pressure from the European Commission over the deficit could stifle the growth surge before it has a chance to pick up momentum. But Mr. Horn and others also predict that Germany and France, which also has broken the deficit rule, are both in almost desperate need of a change in the "one size fits all" Euro Zone rules on deficit spending and that neither country will cut spending enough to meet the requirement. 
"The German government will look for a compromise," Mr. Grebe said. "It will look not to expand the deficit but not to reduce it quickly. Everybody has now heard about this 3 percent threshold, and it will be exceeded again."

HEADLINE: THE VIEW/From Milford; 
A Growing Church Branches Out to the Community

BYLINE:  By JEFF HOLTZ

 BODY:
AS the founder and leader of the Kingdom Life Christian Church in the Devon section of Milford, Bishop Jay Ramirez is as impressive as he is charismatic. Impeccably dressed, handsome and articulate, the former high-ranking Emergency Medical Service official is a picture of control. 
 But even Bishop Ramirez displayed a sense of awe when he recalled how his congregation had offered $100,000 in pledges on consecutive Sundays in July in an effort to drive out a local pornography shop by purchasing the building for $245,000. 
 "I told them, 'Either we believe in what we preach, or we don't,"' Bishop Ramirez, 44, said, referring to the sermon that inspired the donations. 
While the amount raised to buy the building occupied by the Video Pleasures store on the Post Road in Devon might surprise some people, it probably wasn't surprising to those familiar with the ethnically and financially diverse community of about 5,000 on the western tip of the city.
Kingdom Life Church Life, which was started in 1991 and moved into the church in the Devon neighborhood in 1993, owns 21 properties spread over three campuses totaling 75 acres and worth more than $20 million, said Bishop Ramirez, who earned a degree in theology in 1987 at Vision Christian University in San Diego.
There is a sparkling cathedral on Naugatuck Avenue that used to be the Sante's Manor catering hall, a business office, a bookstore, a graphics studio, a family resource center and a recently bought 57-acre park that will eventually feature a recreation center open to church members and city residents.
Kingdom Life, which Bishop Ramirez categorizes as independent and nondenominational, started out in a rented banquet room in the Ramada Inn in Stratford.
There, answering what he describes as "a calling from God," Bishop Ramirez, then a pastor, led a handful of people in bible studies. He said membership at his church has swelled to about 2,000 and is growing.
"I wanted to see a church that was different, he said. "A church that was engaged in the community, involved, active and taking faith and putting it into practical action."
Bishop Ramirez said the congregation was and mostly from lower-middle and middle-class incomes, with a few upper-income members. He said the membership is multicultural, with about 50 percent of it white.
He credits part of the rapid rise of his church to disillusionment with some of the traditional churches.
"You can do dynamic things without the strangleholds of denominational traditions"' he said. "People don't like rules that are judgmental and sermons with no relevance."
Kingdom Life has been very active in Milford and elsewhere in the state. Bishop Ramirez said he oversees Kingdom Life's 102 ministries, as well as 60 other churches in Connecticut and some outside the state. 
His church has been involved with school boards, planning and zoning issues and clean-up projects. As a result, the church has earned praise from some area politicians.
"I have found them to be superb colleagues in a number of different things," said State Senator Win Smith Jr., a Republican who represents Milford, Orange and West Haven. He is also co-chairman of the Devon Revitalization Committee, which has Kingdom Life as one of its key members.
"They are always ready to step up and do their share with money, people, sweat and equity," he said.
Milford's mayor, James L. Richetelli Jr., said he was impressed with the way Kingdom Life's members had improved the properties they bought.
"One of the finest compliments that everybody gives to the Kingdom Life Church is once they buy them and renovate them, they are first-rate, absolutely first-rate," he said.
While the energy of the parishioners has been a major part of the church's growth, the driving force is the Bronx-born Bishop Ramirez, who said he gave up a job as the chief of E.M.S. in the northeast sector of Texas to move to Connecticut with his wife and two daughters to follow his vision. He said his past administrative experience has made a big difference.
"A lot of people come out of seminary with preaching style, but don't have a clue as to how to run an organization," said Bishop Ramirez, who majored in marketing and minored in management at the University of Massachusetts. "When you get this many people giving money in an economy like this and handing it over to an organization, you better know how to manage it."
Although Bishop Ramirez would not divulge his salary or other details of the Kingdom Life's finances, he said the books were overseen by independent auditors and accountants, as well as a treasury and finance committee.
He is not the least bit defensive about the church's use of its nonprofit tax status, especially in light of the fact that Kingdom Life has chosen to keep a number of its properties, including the building in which Video Pleasures is situated, on Milford's tax roll.
"We're taking advantage of nonprofit status to do something with it," he said.
Kingdom Life did have critics early on in Milford, however. Bishop Ramirez said that some city officials and the leaders of some local traditional churches were cool to its arrival. The church was the victim of vandalism and telephone threats.
"Something changed though," said Bishop Ramirez, who told the congregation not to complain to the news media or the police about the problems. "We just quietly kept doing what we knew we were supposed to do, and after about five years, ministers started coming around and relationships were built."
Shutting down Video Pleasures may not be easy for the church, even as its landlord. In December, the store may choose to pick up a three-year option on its current lease. But Bishop Ramirez is ready to wait out the owner if necessary.
"Everybody thinks this is a religious thing, but it not that at all," said the bishop, who packed the church earlier this year on 14 consecutive Wednesday nights with a service called "Sex Is God's Idea." "We have our spiritual convictions on pornography. But frankly, we don't have the right to force those convictions on others.
"That kind of business is an eyesore. It affects development. It affects other businesses."
Jared James, 21, a salesman, and Ronnette James, 24, a teacher, are members who met through Kingdom Life and were married at the church on July 11.
They donated what they described as a "significant amount," while at the same time budgeting to pay for a wedding and home furnishings.
"We wanted to show the community that we're doing more than screaming and shouting on Sundays," Mr. James said. "The goal was to reach those people, too, not just a lot of people on Sundays."

HEADLINE: Reining In Special Education 

BYLINE:  By DEBRA NUSSBAUM

 BODY:
WHEN Susan Cohen and Barry Berg moved to Maplewood from Weehawken five years ago, they assumed they would have to find a good private school for their son Julian. He was 3 years old at the time and had fragile X syndrome, considered the leading cause of autism.
 For the first two years, they sent Julian to a preschool program in New York City, but for kindergarten they began to look for the right placement in New Jersey. The cost of private schools was shocking, ranging from $30,000 to $45,000 a year. But other parents assured the couple that they could get the district to pay for it because New Jersey does so much more for disabled students than most other states. 
 Julian never went to private school, however. After meeting with a special education team in the South Orange/Maplewood School District to develop what is known as an individual education plan, his parents said they were pleasantly surprised to find that the best place was actually their neighborhood school, a mile from their home. And this week, for the third year, Julian will return to Tuscan Elementary School, where he will be in a classroom with six students, a teacher and two aides. 
 The outcome was also satisfactory for the school district, which like so many in New Jersey is dealing with an increasing number of special education students even as a lagging economy is forcing districts to pare down their budgets.
 The numbers are daunting. When public schools open in New Jersey this week, there will be more than 218,000 students between the ages of 3 and 21 classified for special education -- about 16 percent of the 1.4 million public school children in the state. The students' problems range from mild learning disabilities to multiple handicaps. 
 According to Barbara Gantwerk, director of the Office of Special Education Programs for the state Department of Education, the rate is one of the highest in the country, and it is up from 163,000 students in 1990 and 205,500 in 2000. Even so, requests by parents to have their children classified are often denied, which can result in prolonged and costly legal battles.
 Yut'se Thomas, director of the state's Office of School Funding, said that while the average cost of education in New Jersey is about $10,000 per pupil, the price tag for a special education student can range from about $20,000 to $100,000 for a private placement. Currently, Ms. Thomas said, about 19,000 students in New Jersey are being placed outside their districts.
 As the number of students and the cost of their educations increase, school districts in the state -- many of which had their requests for budget increases voted down last spring -- are finding that they can no longer pay for special education despite the 1975 federal law, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, that guarantees a "free and appropriate public education" for all disabled students. 
 As a result, school boards and administrators -- along with parents whose children are not classified -- are increasingly raising a once-taboo subject: saving money in special education by saying no to parents who demand a private placement and offering them special in-house programs like classrooms for students with autism and emotional disabilities. In some cases, administrators are even asking parents to bring their children back from private placements to save districts hundreds of thousands of dollars in tuition and transportation costs.
 Mark Finkelstein, superintendent of the Middlesex County Educational Services Commission, which provides special education services for 25 of the state's 610 districts, said that schools -- despite the fear of sounding insensitive -- find themselves having to adopt the philosophy that "a free and appropriate education doesn't have to be the most expensive program."
 James Murphy, executive director of the New Jersey Association of School Administrators, said the worsening economic picture has "pitted parents against parents." 
 "Parents say, "We think special education students should get what they need, but don't take it away from my kid,"' Mr. Murphy said.
 In the past, districts tried to include classified students in regular education programs, supplementing their education with an aide or some other support, and as a last resort paying for a private school out of the district. But now there is an urgent need to match the programs in the state's private schools, especially when they have a concentration of students with similar disabilities.

'Whole New Philosophy'
 "It's a whole new philosophy," Mr. Finkelstein said. "The economy has forced districts to look at these programs. As more successes are realized, more districts will come on board."
 To that end, many districts have started new programs in the past two years, or are planning to do so this fall.
 In Westfield, where 1,000 of the district's 5,700 pupils are classified for special education, two classrooms for emotionally disturbed high school students have opened in the past two and half years. There are 16 students in the classes who would have previously been in private placement, said Dr. Ted Kozlik, director of special services and the president of the National Association of Pupil Services Administrators.
 In South Orange and Maplewood, which have more than 900 classified students out of 6,300 public school children, six new special education programs will be introduced this year, including an integrated kindergarten for regular and special education students, a classroom for students with language learning disabilities, a high school classroom for students with emotional disabilities and a middle school classroom for students with multiple handicaps. While 125 students were placed out of district last year, Dr. Linda Arrington-Bowles, director of pupil services, said the hope was that the number would drop below 100 this year.
 "We are slowly begin to transfer students back into our school system," Dr. Arrington-Bowles said.
 The same is true in other districts throughout the state. Beginning in Edison this year, there will be two classrooms for children ages 5 to 7 and one classroom for preschool students with autism. Of the 13,200 student in the district, about 1,435 are classified, including 100 with autism, said Dr. Shirley Ikeda, the superintendent, and the district has contracted with the Middlesex Country consortium to implement and run the program. 
 In Cherry Hill, where 1,450 of the district's 11,600 students are classified, new classrooms and programs for students with autism are starting up, said Charlie Lange, director of special services, and the number of students going out of district for special services is expected to drop from 104 last year to 94 this school year.
 Nancy Novack, director of pupil services, in Montgomery Township, Somerset County, which started a program for autistic students four years ago, plans to open a classroom for third- and fourth graders in addition to classrooms it currently has for pre-school children and students in kindergarten through second grade. The district, which has about 450 of its 4,300 students enrolled in special education, trained teachers this summer in alternative approaches to reading instruction like the Wilson Reading Program in the hope that some children would be able to improve their reading skills enough to avoid being classified for special education. 
 And Jersey City schools have contracted with the Middlesex County Education Services Commission to review their special education department and make recommendations on how to save money by providing good programs within the district.
 In 1975, when the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was instituted, the plan was for the federal government to provide 40 percent of the funds for special education, Ms. Gantwerk said. Yet in New Jersey, Ms. Thomas said, the federal government is contributing only about 12 to 15 percent of the cost.
 The state will give $926 million to New Jersey's school districts this year for special education, along with another $52 million in extraordinary aid for children whose expenses are more than $40,000 a year. The amount of extraordinary aid is up $37 million from last year, Ms. Thomas said.

Lack of Financing Cited
 "It boils down to the state and federal government do not provide the funding they should," said Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association. "They really don't have anywhere to look but property taxpayers."
 There are more than 600 districts in the state, and many spend from 15 to 20 percent of their school budgets on special education -- or a total of close to $2 billion a year -- said Mr. Murphy of the New Jersey Association of School Administrators.
 For example, Westfield, with a $64 million school budget, spends $11 million to finance special education. And Cherry Hill will spend about $15 million of a $132 million school budget on special education this year. 
 But with state aid stagnant and property taxes rising, more administrators have begun to tighten the belt on special education.
 "From 1975 into the 90's, special education was a in a continuous growth pattern," said Mr. Finkelstein, who heads one of 10 consortiums in New Jersey where districts band together to provide services.
 "Groups lobbied and were successful," he said. "At the same time, the funds from those improvements had to come from somewhere. It came from the regular education domain, and there is resentment."
 In addition to increased costs in transportation and salaries, filling positions is costing more and more because of the difficulty in finding educators who are willing and able to take the jobs, Mr. Kozlik said. For instance, special services directors now earn from $85,000 to $140,000 a year -- comparable to salaries for high school principals..
 Over the past 30 years, decisions about whether a child should be classified and where he or she should be placed were often driven by fear of litigation rather than by what was best for the student, educators say. How well new programs will be accepted in the schools will to a large part depend on how they are received by the parents.
 "This is a very litigious field," said Dr. Kathleen Rotter, assistant professor of special education at The College of New Jersey and a former special services administrator in the Hillsborough School District. "More than litigation, it's the fear of litigation. You would rather give it up in the I.E.P. (individual education plan) meeting than go to court."
 As Mr. Belluscio of the New Jersey School Board Association put it, the federal law "gives parents a lot of power to challenge any decision made by the schools." 
 "The law is structured to give the parents a very strong voice," he said.
 The desire to avoid litigation can also come into play when deciding whether to classify a child, Dr. Rotter said.
 "Our eligibility standards are not clear at all," she said. "It's easier to determine if a child is mentally retarded, but the definition for learning disability is not an agreed standard. There is no formula, and schools have to find their own way."
 Theodore Sussan, a lawyer in Spotswood who has handled special education cases for the past two decades, says many parents are reluctant to try a new program in the district.
 "I hear about that all the time," Mr. Sussan said. "My cases are involved in that issue. The cost is often fairly significant and school districts, understandably, want to minimize that cost. Sometimes they get something that doesn't deliver what the child is entitled to. It's something parents don't want to try because they don't want to take a risk with their child's future."
 Other times, he said, the public school hires the right specialists and truly has the best program for the child. "If the program is appropriate, the district is to be applauded," Mr. Sussan said.
 Not surprisingly, parents whose children are attending classes out of their own districts are reluctant to try a new program if they are finding success in the current atmosphere, said Debra Jennings, executive co-director of the Statewide Parent Advocacy Network, a nonprofit organization that advises parents and professionals of rights and education programs in the state.
 "When you are the parent of a child with disabilities, you don't want to hear that you are part of balancing the school budget," Ms. Jennings said.

Trying to Strike a Balance
 The hope of educators is that they will strike the right note to please both parents of classified students and the rest of the taxpayers.
 In Middlesex County, Mr. Finkelstein sees programs like the one his consortium is starting at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt School annex in Edison as the pattern for many other plans in the county. At the Roosevelt school, three classrooms will open this fall for children with autism who in previous years would have been bused to programs outside the district.
 "Every year we surveyed our 25 districts with the old Ed Koch question, 'How am I doing?"' he said. "What they said was, 'We want programs within our schools.' There is no question that in this county more districts will start doing this."
 Bringing programs into district can save as much as $8,000 to $12,000 per student, said Mr. Finkelstein, who for 20 years was director of special services in Perth Amboy and Woodbridge. Moreover, he said, the advantage for the child is that he is in his local school and not bused a long distance.
 "It is unconscionable to transport a 3-year-old an hour and a half each way," he said. "You have students now who won't be on buses for hours. They will be 15 minutes from home."
 But Mr. Finkelstein does not encourage districts to rush into these programs without considering the amount of training and the types of professionals needed to make them work.
 "Hiring a teacher and hiring an aide doesn't work," he said. "You have to train the whole school. It's a comprehensive undertaking. It's the right way to go if you have the space and the expertise."
 Phyllis DeLucia, who will supervise the three classes in Edison this year, said she had already met with parents to assure them that their children would receive high-quality services.
 "There is some apprehension because this is a new thing," Ms. DeLucia said. "In any I.E.P.decision, communication is vital. We are trying to do this the right way. We will continue to meet on different topics and even do training for parents. It's vital to parents that we communicate. It's a lifeline. We do everything to make the parents comfortable." 
 Colleen Connolly-Jones and her husband, David, moved to New Jersey from Scottsdale, Ariz., because they were looking for the best school programs for their son, Matthew, one of their three children, who was diagnosed with autism at age 3. 
 "In Arizona, the programs were so behind the times and so lacking," said Mrs. Connolly-Jones, who grew up in Hamilton and now lives in Montgomery Township. 
 She said she looked at several private schools, but when they moved two years ago, she put Matthew in Village Elementary School, a few miles from their home. After observing the class, she decided she liked the program, and she liked the idea that one of his brothers would be in the classroom next door.
 "It was a team effort like I'd never seen in Arizona," she said.
 What is more, she said: "It's important to be on a playground with regular-education children. This is based on our needs, and I'm not anti-private school They want the best program for Matthew here. If we had a chance to move Matthew into a private school, no way would I take it."
 Next Monday, Matthew will begin his third year at Orchard Hill Elementary in Montgomery Township in a class with seven students, a teacher and two aides.
 "Obviously, there are many fine programs nearby, but we are attempting to provide services in our district," said Nancy Novack, director of pupil service for Montgomery Township schools. "The district has a commitment to provide services to these children."
 Ms. Cohen in Maplewood hopes that her child will be able to stay in the district, but she says they will have to take one year at a time.
 "We are a little worried because we are not sure they have a good program in middle school and high school," she said. "There is no right answer. It's what feels right for your child at the time."

HEADLINE: What It Takes to Keep the Jazz Hot

BYLINE: By CHARLES PAIKERT

 BODY:
IT'S not easy running a jazz club anywhere at anytime, much less in largely suburban New Jersey, in what are hardly the best economic times.
 The audience for the music, while dedicated, is small. Jazz accounted for only 3 percent of recorded music sales last year, according to Nielsen SoundScan, which tracks retail sales nationwide.
 Being next to New York cuts both ways, say musicians, promoters and patrons. While more people are aware of and exposed to the music, a New Jersey jazz fan working in Manhattan can stay in the city and choose from over a dozen places to hear music nearly any night of the week. 
 On the plus side, the northern half of the state can listen to WBGO-FM, anaward-winning public radio station devoted exclusively to jazz, which frequently announces local performances. And many professional jazz musicians live in Essex , Bergen and Hudson counties, ranging from respected sidemen and studio players like John Lee, Earl May and Geary Moore to better-known leaders and stars like Bill Charlap, Jon Faddis, Slide Hampton and Bucky Pizzarelli.
 Several places offer jazz once or twice a week, among them the Priory and Renaissance Caf in Newark, Crossroads in Garwood, the Cornerstone in Metuchen and Luna Rossa Restaurant in Clifton. But only three present jazz all week and consistently book top talent -- Trumpets in Montclair, Shanghai Jazz in Madison and the recently opened Cecil's in West Orange. 
 ''It is damn difficult,'' said Enrico Granafei, one of Trumpets' owners. Mr. Granafei, who was born in Italy in 1952, runs Trumpets with his wife, Kristine Massari, 50. They took over the business in 1999, three years after another couple failed to revive it. Trumpets was founded in the late 1980's by Emily Wingert, who ran it for eight years. 
 Shanghai Jazz is owned by David Niu, born in Taiwan in 1960, and his wife, Martha Chang, 38. They took the space over from Ms. Chang's parents, who ran it as a Chinese restaurant, Four Seas Cuisines of China, until they retired in 1995.
 Neither couple has children, and both share a passion for jazz. Mr. Granafei is a working jazz harmonica player, and often sits in with the musicians at Trumpets; many are his friends . Mr. Niu has an infectious fan's enthusiasm for the groups he presents. ''Wow! Was that great music or what?'' he exclaimed happily before a cheering crowd on a Saturday night after a lively set by Mr. Lee's group, which featured a guest appearance by the trumpeter Jon Faddis, the former director of the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band. 
 While both couples share the tasks of running their clubs, they know other parts of the working world as well. Ms. Massari has been an Italian teacher in the West Orange public school system for 14 years. Besides being a musician, Mr. Granafei worked as a "freelance interpreter" to make ends meet. Ms. Chang, a former Fulbright scholar, is completing her doctorate in Chinese politics at Harvard while she runs the restaurant with her husband. Mr. Niu is a lawyer who practiced in Morristown and Manhattan before becoming a fulltime restaurateur and club owner.
 While Mr. Granafei proudly calls Trumpets a club with food, not a restaurant with music, he admitted it was hard to attract people who really care about the music -- which complicates the club's finances. 
 A respectful crowd of about 30 customers who paid a $20 cover charge and a $10 drink minimum were on hand on a recent Friday night in Montclair to hear Grammy-award winning vibraphonist Dave Samuels -- in a room that could easily have held more than twice that many. By contrast, the next night in Madison, nearly 100 people, most of whom had ordered a full-course meal, packed the dining room and bar to hear Mr. Lee's quartet play with Mr. Faddis. 
 When asked if Trumpets is profitable after paying bands anywhere from $500 to $1,200 or more per night, Mr. Granafei said, ''Let's put it this way, we survive.''
 At Shanghai Jazz, meanwhile, the Chinese cuisine often entices patrons to spend more than the $30 minimum. That, as well as keeping the cost of bands under $1,000 per night (while offering them free food), has made the club profitable Mr. Niu says when pressed.
 Indeed, the food and the atmosphere attract musicians as well as customers. 
 ''No one goes into the gig thinking they're going to make a lot of money,'' said Mr. Lee, a South Orange resident. ''But the musicians all love the food, and they always have a good time. It's almost like an off night.''
 Both sets of owners said they have their pick of top musicians from the plentiful local talent. At this point, Mr. Niu said, ''they call us.'' Ms. Massari says she and her husband are focusing on for bringing in international jazz acts. Many, like Vitali Imereli, the violin virtuoso from Estonia by way of the former Soviet Georgia, were personally recruited by Mr. Granafei, who regularly plays at jazz festivals in Europe.
 New Jersey's newest jazz club impresario, the drummer and producer Cecil Brooks 3rd, believes New Jersey has so many talented jazz musicians eager to play live gigs that there is room for another fulltime club.Last month, he opened Cecil's in downtown West Orange, which seats about 75.
 Having once booked acts at Trumpets, Mr. Brooks knows there are easier ways to make money than running a jazz club. ''Maybe,'' he said, ''I'm a fatal optimistic.''

A Dead End

DATELINE: RIVERTON 

 BODY:
LIKE the detour that millions of motorists on Interstate 95 are forced to take in New Jersey -- the highway's one interruption between Florida and Maine --joggers and bicyclists will have to leave a proposed trail along the Delaware River and travel instead on an asphalt road when they reach this riverfront community.
 If a group of residents here has its way, the 19th-century stone mansions and Victorian-era Riverton Yacht Club, one of the country's oldest, on the waterfront will not be part of the scenery for those using the 50-mile Delaware River Heritage Trail that is to run along both sides of the river in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 
 Now in the final planning stages, the Heritage Trail is intended to stretch from Philadelphia to Morrisville on the Pennsylvania side, then cross the Calhoun Street Bridge into Trenton, and continue south through Trenton, Hamilton and 13 municipalities in Burlington County to Palmyra, where it will loop back to Pennsylvania across the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge.
 First proposed by the National Park Service in 1996, the concept of the trail was to create a multi-use pathway for the lower Delaware, as close to the shore as possible, connecting historic sites and natural resources. 
 With the exception of Fieldsboro, which the project's Burlington County coordinator, Matt Johnson, said has no accessible riverfront land, Riverton is the only New Jersey municipality that is balking at the idea of incorporating the trail along the river. 
 In a stance that advocates of the pathway label "provincial elitism," those living near the riverbank here have turned the proposal into a campaign issue. Warning borough residents that the trail will bring unwanted traffic, litter and public urination - demonstrated by a row of toilets placed along the riverbank earlier this year -- a slate of opposition candidates won the Republican primary here in June. And a previous vote by the Riverton Borough Council endorsing the trail is likely to be rescinded by the new council candidates, who are expected to be elected in November.
 A public road that runs along the river in this borough of 2,759 residents currently enjoys a steady stream of bikers, joggers and baby strollers, but opponents fear the riverfront will become unmanageable if this stretch of Bank Avenue becomes the designated route for the Heritage Trail. 
 "This road has achieved a balancing by its own nature, it has found its own level," said Michael Heine, a leading opponent who lives a half-block from the river in Riverton. "The trail now encourages additional use by publicizing to the world that this is a pleasant area to bike along or walk along."
 Which, of course, was one of the intentions of the trail, according to its proponents.
 "It's a source of local pride," said Bill Matulewicz, who sits on the Delanco Planning Board and is a member of the Heritage Trail's steering committee. "We asked each community to think about: 'If you were bringing folks into your town, what would you like to show off?"'
 For Riverton, the answer apparently is Broad Street, the spottily developed commercial district that runs parallel to New Jersey Transit's new light rail line. Still stinging from their failed efforts to block that equally unpopular transportation system, some residents here see the Heritage Trail as another example of government imposing its will against local citizens. 
 A petition to route the Heritage Trail along Broad Street rather than the riverfront states: "We will not accept being assigned by Borough Council or any other body to be an entertainment sideshow or a target for gawkers while we care for our families, work in our gardens, or entertain our friends. We will not be coerced to provide recreational parks for the town, the county, or the state."
 So far, Mr. Heine said, the petition has 89 signatures.
 Ed Sanderson, who recently resigned as chairman of Riverton's environmental commission, largely over this issue, said the light rail line battle served as a catalyst, creating a general distrust of government.
 "I think they just used a lot of scare tactics spurred on by private property zealots fearing that there's some kind of government conspiracy to take over their properties," said Mr. Sanderson. 
 Mr. Matulewicz, whose town has embraced the idea of a multi-use trail that would also run through its residential waterfront neighborhood, said he had a hard time understanding Riverton's opposition to a riverfront trail route.
 "Nobody here's gotten in my face and said the mongrel hordes are going to be screaming down the waterfront," said Mr. Matulewicz, an avid bicyclist. "I guess the folks here are a little more reasonable." 
 As designed, the Heritage Trail provides two alternate routes: the business route, which will run through the towns' commercial districts, and the riverview route. Because the trail goes through so many municipalities, the level of involvement is being largely left to the local governments, said Mr. Johnson, the Open Space Coordinator for Burlington County. 
 In some towns, like Riverton, plans call for little more than signs pointing out the route of the trail. In other stretches, roadways may be striped to mark designated bike paths, and interpretive signs will point out places of interest. In some communities like Burlington City, riverfront promenades already exist, while in others, new off-road sections need to be constructed. Mr. Johnson said there are about 10 places along the route where bridges will have to be built to cross creeks and river inlets. Restrooms and parking lots would be situated in parks along the route, said Mr. Johnson, who estimates the cost at $3 million to $5 million.
 For sections of the trail that run along county roads, the county would be responsible for the costs of those improvements, while municipalities would have to raise money to cover costs on sections of the trail running along local roads. The $375,000 engineering study now under way was covered by a federal grant, said Celeste Tracy of the Delaware River Greenway Partnership, the agency in charge of developing the trail.
 Noting that most of the other money could be raised through state and federal grants, Ms. Tracy said the Heritage Trail exemplifies a national trend to tap into communities' natural and commercial resources to help improve the local economies. In its scope and character, it has been compared with other urban-suburban multi-use pathways, like the Minuteman Trail outside of Boston and the Crescent Trail that runs from Bethesda, Md., through Washington and to Mount Vernon, Va. 
 "Trails in general are considered part of the eco-tourism field," said Ms. Tracy. "In surveys, people say they want more passive recreation in their communities. And studies across the country show that property values do increase with the existence of trails."
 Once the engineering and archeological studies are completed later this year, the advisory committee will hold a series of public meetings. Ms. Tracy is hoping that when the trail is up and running, which she estimates will be in two or three years, that local residents will see the value of it. 
 "Once the trail is marked and people start identifying with it and seeing that the problems they envisioned don't happen, they may want to have it run down Bank Avenue, and we can do that," said Ms. Tracy.

HEADLINE: If They Build Them? 

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO

 BODY:
EVERY apartment developer in Westchester wants tenants like Jonathan and Cindy Frieder.
He is a 32-year-old technology consultant who works in Manhattan while she teaches special education and math at New Rochelle High School. In June they moved into a brand-new high rise next to the White Plains train station. 
 "We wanted to live at a central and convenient location," Mr. Frieder said. 
 The couple is saving money to buy a house in Westchester, where Ms. Frieder grew up. On weekends, Mr. Frieder runs with his marathon teammates in Tarrytown, and the couple visits a country club with Ms. Frieder's parents. 
But there haven't been enough young, white-collar renters like the Frieders to go around at a time when the county is having the largest construction boom in rental housing in three decades.
"There are 1,500 rental units in various stages of development in Westchester," said Gilbert Mercurio, the chief executive of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. "We have not seen anything remotely comparable to this since 1970."
Louis R. Cappelli, who is building a large residential and commercial complex in White Plains, said he wanted to attract white-collar renters between 25 and 35 to his apartments -- an aspiration shared by other developers.
"It's people like you, seriously, that I want to bring here," Mr. Cappelli told the reporter, who is 27. "People who are single or newly married, who may work in Manhattan."
All of these units were proposed and planned in the late 1990's or 2000, when rents in Manhattan were escalating feverishly. That steep climb stopped with Sept. 11. Since then, prices on Manhattan apartments have dropped by as much as $600 for two-bedroom units that had rented for $3,000 on average, says the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan real estate brokerage.
Linda Lyons, a real estate broker with Prudential Rand in White Plains, said a lot can happen between the time a building project is proposed and when it is finished. "Once the construction starts, the market could easily change," she said. "That's what's happening right now."
While the Manhattan market has been changing, more than a thousand new rental units have cropped up on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River in Jersey City, Hoboken and Edgewater, according to the developers there, intensifying the competition for renters. And historically low mortgage interest rates helped many people make the move out of rentals into their own homes earlier than they had planned.
By the end of last week, Bank Street Commons, where the Frieders live, has leased only 76 of the 250 apartments that entered the market in February, said Karyn Smith, its property manager. Among the building's draws are free parking; the developer is also building an indoors gym and pool.
Clayton Park, an eight-story building on the opposite side of White Plain's business district, began renting in March. Less than 40 percent of its 260 apartments are occupied now, said Clay Fowler, the principal partner of the development.
The Hudson Park, two nine-story buildings on the Yonkers waterfront that opened in March, has filled just over half of its first group of 126 units, said Arthur Collins, its developer. Another 140 units will come on the market this fall.
And Mr. Cappelli, the most active developer in Westchester, expects to begin signing tenants in October for one of the residential high-rises at the City Center, the $300 million project at the heart of White Plains, adding more than 300 units to the rental stock.
"This is not good," said Steve Malpezzi, the chairman of the department of real estate and urban land economics at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. "If I were an investor, I wouldn't be happy."
Each developer has set rent at around $1,800 for a one-bedroom and $2,500 for a two-bedroom unit, at least $500 more than rents for similar-sized units in apartment buildings constructed before World War II.
Recently, every leasing office has been offering bonuses to attract tenants. Only 11 months' rent for a one-year lease! (Or better, 10 months for one year.) Gift certificates for the Westchester Mall! Free monthly train passes to Manhattan! A rebate of $1,200 for the first month rent!
"I am worried," said Esther Mena, the leasing manager for Bank Street Commons. "There is a lot of competition, and people are shopping around."
The Frieders said they got a hefty load of "incentives," as the promotional tactics are called, when they signed their current lease.
"Otherwise, we wouldn't have met our savings objective for a down payment," Mr. Frieder said, "and we would have never moved in here."
Real estate agents say that many people between 25 and 35 who have traditionally rented are buying condominiums, some armed with gifts from parents for down payments and all eager to take advantage of the low interest rates. 
"Anyone who can afford a good monthly rent is buying into the condo or coop market," said Ms. Lyons. "Rentals are low." 
But the recent rebound in interest rates, following signs of economic recovery, might slow down buying, real estate brokers say. A number of developers yet to reach the final stages of their rental building construction have decided to convert their units into condominiums. Mr. Cappelli has announced plans to sell the units of his second residential building at City Center instead of leasing them.
Boston-based Pappas Management, which had planned to build 106 rental apartments at the corner of Barker and Church Streets in White Plains, said it has reached the same decision, said David Murphy, a company spokesman. The construction will start after the company has acquired state approvals for condominium construction in about four months.
Not all rental units can be readily converted to condominiums, since demand for suburban one-bedroom condominiums is low and developers cannot simply put one unit up for sale and one next door for rent, real estate experts say.
Surprisingly, the leasing managers say, while these new apartment buildings are not drawing many young people out of Manhattan, a significant number of white-collar workers in White Plains and Connecticut, some empty nesters, have signed leases. Roughly three quarters of the tenants at Bank Street Commons are in this group, Ms. Mena said.
That owes much to the area's expansion as a business community. The office vacancy rate of White Plains has decreased from 34 percent in 1995 to 16 percent today, according to the city government, and its office space has remained at slightly more than 12 million square feet.
That also means a slightly older crowd, people who don't care as much about the proximity of bars or nightclubs. 
But Mr. Cappelli is determined to make the city livelier. He tells anyone who's willing to listen about a lineup of stores that have signed on to come to his City Center: Legal Seafood, the Cheesecake Factory, Barnes and Noble and Circuit City.
"White Plains is hip," said Mr. Cappelli. "I will make it hipper."
And Mr. Fowler, the principal developer of the $58 million Clayton Park, said: "In the long run, all the developments are going to bring more people into the city, and the community will build up. The more, the merrier. I've seen that happen before elsewhere, and it will happen here."

HEADLINE: CONCERN GROWING AS FAMILIES BYPASS 9/11 VICTIMS' FUND 

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
Federal and local officials are growing increasingly concerned that nearly 60 percent of families who lost relatives in the September 2001 terror attacks have not filed claims with the victim compensation fund established by Congress.
 The most recent statistics show that 3,016 people died in the attacks at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and aboard an airliner that crashed in Pennsylvania. But as of Friday, with the Dec. 22 deadline for applications less than four months away, only 1,240 death claims had been filed with the fund. And while no one knows exactly how many people were injured in the attacks, so far only 1,035 of them have sought compensation from the fund, which has no cap. 
 "I am concerned, and I think the administration is concerned," said Kenneth R. Feinberg, the federally appointed lawyer who oversees the fund and makes its final decisions. Mr. Feinberg has estimated that the fund, which has paid out $623.1 million, could distribute as much as $3 billion. There is a basic award for every death, which is increased to reflect a family's economic loss as a result of the victim's demise. Mr. Feinberg plans to meet Tuesday with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City to discuss the mayor's unease about the pace of applications, and several members of Congress have asked Mr. Feinberg to visit their home states to help raise awareness about the Dec. 22 deadline, which is built into the fund statute and cannot be waived.
"The statute has a little more than three months to run," Mr. Feinberg said. "So where are the rest of the people?"
Some families say they are deciding whether to file a lawsuit instead. Others, especially high-income families who lost a breadwinner in the collapse of the trade center, may be awaiting developments in a federal lawsuit in Manhattan. And still others say they have not recovered sufficiently from their grief to face the paperwork involved in filing a claim -- and the painful memories it would bring to the surface.
The fund, created by Congress as part of a legislative package to protect the airline industry from ruinous litigation, requires those who file claims to waive their right to sue over the attacks -- other than lawsuits filed against the terrorists who planned the attacks and those who are accused of harboring or financing them.
But citing Justice Department statistics, Mr. Feinberg said that only 69 disqualifying lawsuits have been filed, and only three of those were filed in the last five months. "Most people are not suing and have not filed with the fund," he said. "You have to ask why." 
His own answer -- one that was echoed by the leaders of some family groups that coalesced after the disaster -- is that many people are still too paralyzed by their grief to confront the logistical burden and emotional pain of filing a death claim.
"I have met with thousands of families," Mr. Feinberg said. "And you would be amazed at the number of people who, when I say the deadline is approaching, still come up to me in tears and say, 'I'm not ready.' "
By most measures, the financial incentives for filing would seem to be substantial. Roughly 800 claims have been approved, and the average tax-free award for a death claim has been $1.6 million, after all the deductions for insurance and other offsetting awards. Individual awards range from $250,000 to $6.1 million, and awards for injury claims range from $500 to $6.8 million, with the higher figures reflecting claims by burn victims. 
Those awards may seem inadequate, however, for families of high-income or well-insured victims, some lawyers and family representatives said. Those families may be postponing the decision about whether to file a claim with the fund until a significant decision is made in court cases pending against the airlines.
James P. Kreindler, an aviation disaster lawyer in New York who represents many Sept. 11 families, explained that a federal judge in Manhattan is weighing whether the airlines have any liability to any victims other than those riding on the four hijacked aircraft. If the answer is yes, he said, some high-income families who lost a breadwinner in the trade center might decide that a lawsuit would be more advantageous than a fund application.
"A lot of people would prefer to sue rather than go into the fund," Mr. Kreindler said. "But that really depends on your ability to tolerate risk."
A family with a claim of $8 million would probably be best served by the speed and certainty the fund offers, he said, but a family with a claim of $30 million and substantial offsetting insurance would find the fund's awards much less attractive.
But Mr. Feinberg said he did not see any such pattern in the claims that the fund has received so far. "It's not as if all the high-end claimants are waiting, and the low-end ones aren't," he said.
For some low-income families, fear seems to be as much at work as grief, he said. About 100 undocumented workers are thought to have died in the attacks, but the fund has received claims on behalf of only about 30 of them. The others, he said, are afraid of deportation or other sanctions if they file, despite written reassurances to the contrary from Justice Department and immigration officials.
Another factor, some family members said, may be the uncertainty over the deadline for filing a lawsuit. Congress required that any lawsuits related to the attacks be filed in New York, where state law typically requires that a wrongful death claim be filed within two years of the event. The state has extended the deadline by six months, to March 10, 2004. But Mr. Kreindler said it was not clear whether non-New York residents can take advantage of that extension, which may have prompted some of them to focus first on preserving their legal options rather than filing a fund claim.
"Families are confused," said William Doyle, whose son Joey died in the trade center and who maintains one of the largest e-mail networks of injury victims and survivors. "Between the court and the fund, there are a lot of different deadlines."
Mr. Doyle, a human clearinghouse who sends information to hundreds of 9/11 victims' families, said he was confident that most families know about the fund, and are aware of the approaching deadline. "But you have families out there that are still grieving," he said. "It's tough to wade through all this paperwork."
When the fund was first set up, it was the target of fierce criticism by some bereaved families, who resented its limitations on their right to sue and disputed its formulas for calculating their economic losses and emotional suffering. One of the most vocal and active critics was Charles G. Wolf, whose wife, Katherine, died in the trade center's collapse.
But Mr. Wolf said on Friday that he does not think that lingering anger and dissatisfaction are the reasons for the low application rate. Indeed, he said that Mr. Feinberg has recently proven to be so much more flexible and fair in his policies and decisions that Mr. Wolf now plans to file his own claim with the fund and is actively encouraging others to do so.
"For the mental health of these victims, they need to file," Mr. Wolf said. "They need to put closure on something."
But he still meets resistance, he said. One parent told him that a fund award would seem like "blood money." The man seemed only partly persuaded by Mr. Wolf's argument that he should file a claim and "do something wonderful with the money -- establish a foundation, give it to charity in your daughter's name."
Mr. Wolf acknowledged that "it's painful to file, because you have to go through a lot of stuff that hurts so much. There's a lot of pain avoidance going on," he said.
Still, he has moved further along than a New Jersey widow who is part of Mr. Doyle's e-mail list. Last January, she wrote him to say that she did "not know one family that has settled" with the victim compensation fund. Last week, she said she has still not filed a claim with the fund.
"I have not given it much thought," she said softly, after asking that her name not be used. "I have been involved in other things just trying to get through each day." Asked about the approaching deadline, she said, "Considering where most people are in their grief, from the people I know, the deadline Congress set is just too soon."
It is responses like that, Mr. Feinberg said, not debates about the merits of litigation, that haunt him as he heads off for a fresh round of informational meetings across the country this month. A schedule of those meetings, including two in New Jersey, three in the New York City area and one in Connecticut, is onlineat: www.usdoj.gov/victimcompensation/whatsnew.html.
"If people want to litigate, fine," Mr. Feinberg said. "I think it's a mistake, it's ineffective and protracted and it prevents closure -- but at least they're making a choice."
He continued: "But I really worry about the people who will arrive at Dec. 22 having done nothing. Those people are united in their grief and fear, and they're the people I'm trying to reach."

HEADLINE: Now Free to Marry, Canada's Gays Say, 'Do I?' 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: TORONTO, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
When David Andrew, a 41-year-old federal government employee, heard that the highest Ontario court had extended marriage rights to same-sex couples two months ago, he broke into a sweat.
 "I was dreading the conversation," he said, fearing that his partner would feel jilted when he told him that he did not believe in the institution. "Personally, I saw marriage as a dumbing down of gay relationships. My dread is that soon you will have a complacent bloc of gay and lesbian soccer moms." 
 When he moved in with David Warren, a 41-year-old software company project officer, he wrote up a set of vows that remains above their bed, seven years later. They promise "a confidant, playmate, partner in crime, biggest fan and protector." But they stop short of monogamy, which is something Mr. Andrew also says he does not believe in. 
His skepticism about marriage is a recurring refrain among Canadian gay couples, who have not rushed to marry in great numbers in the weeks since June 10, when they became eligible. Rather, the extension of marriage rights has thrown gays here into a heated debate, akin to the one that embroiled the American civil rights movement in the 1960's, over how much "integration" is a good thing -- and what gay marriage should consist of. 
How marriage affects gay and lesbian life in Canada, and wider society, is an issue being closely watched by gays in the United States, who see what is happening in Canada as a harbinger for American society.
In Canada, conservative commentators worry aloud that gay marriage will undermine society, but many gays express the fear that it will undermine their notions of who they are. They say they want to maintain the unique aspects of their culture and their place at the edge of social change.
It is a debate that pits those who celebrate a separate and flamboyant way of life as part of a counterculture against those who long for acceptance into the mainstream. So heated is the conversation that some gay Canadians said in interviews that they would not bring up the topic at dinner parties.
"Ambiguity is a good word for the feeling among gays about marriage," said Mitchel Raphael, editor in chief of Fab, a popular gay magazine in Toronto. "I'd be for marriage if I thought gay people would challenge and change the institution and not buy into the traditional meaning of 'till death do us part' and monogamy forever. We should be Oscar Wildes and not like everyone else watching the play."
It is too soon to draw conclusions about how widespread gay marriage will become in Canada over time. Many same-sex couples say they need time to consider so basic a commitment, or are waiting for the anniversary of their first dates or of their commitment ceremonies to tie the knot.
Gay men seem more apprehensive about marriage than lesbians, and generally, couples with children, or thinking of having children, express more interest in marrying. 
The ambivalence is reflected in the numbers of gay couples who have chosen marriage so far. While members of Toronto's gay population, by far Canada's largest, express support of the Ontario court's ruling and Prime Minister Jean Chretien's decision to introduce legislation to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, they have not mobilized to defend the change. Even as some churches and conservative politicians have begun to mobilize against the legislation, demonstrations for it have been few and mostly small.
Between the June 10 court ruling and last Monday, 590 gay and lesbian couples had taken out marriage licenses in Toronto's city hall, out of a total of 5,500 couples receiving licenses. And more than a hundred of the gay couples were American who crossed the border to marry. 
A total of 6,685 same-sex Toronto couples registered as permanent partners in the 2001 census, about one-fifth of the total across Canada.
Still, the numbers are enough to have spawned the beginnings of a gay marriage industry. The magazine Fab published a guide to Toronto's new gay marriage scene, with tips on bridal harnesses and blue leather garters, bachelor party strippers and where to find counterculture bouquets of green roses and black magic flowers.
But the issue also included an essay by Rinaldo Walcott, a sociologist at the University of Toronto, warning that marriage could be an agent of homogenization. 
"I can already hear folks saying things like: 'Why are bathhouses needed? Straights don't have them,' " he wrote. "Will queers now have to live with the heterosexual forms of guilt associated with something called cheating?"
Many gays and lesbians who celebrate their new rights view such thinking as retrograde.
"It's the vestiges of a culture of victimization, of a culture that's tied to being in a ghetto," said Enrique Lopez, 38, an investment banker who has been in a steady relationship for two years but says he is not ready to marry. 
"The vast majority want to live innocuous, boring lives, and the option of marriage is part of that dream."
The ambivalence toward marriage is not confined to gays and lesbians, on either side of the border. Common-law arrangements represent 14 percent of all households in Canada, according to the 2001 census, considerably more than the figure for unmarried households in the United States, which the census of 2000 put at 9.1 percent.
All told 1,158,410 couples live in common-law arrangements throughout Canada, according to the 2001 census, which found 34,200 self-identified same-sex couples.
"So many of our American gay friends are so pro-marriage and excited that marriage is happening here," said Peter Blanchet, a 46-year-old opera singer. His partner, Brad Eyre, a 35-year-old senior Toronto city manager, interrupted, "The Canadians less so."
The two have been together for eight years and share a house, and they are thinking about marriage. Nevertheless, Mr. Eyre added, "I don't see the need to rush."
Because common-law couples have most of the same rights and obligations in Canada as married couples -- from jointly filing tax returns to spousal support after a breakup -- many gay couples here do not see much reason to marry.
"Physically, legally, emotionally, we don't feel the need to have a piece of paper to prove our union," said Penny Gyokeres, 30, an unemployed warehouse manager, who has lived for four years with Cheryl Fulcher, 44, a retail merchandise analyst.
But there are benefits for those who want to have children and share parental rights.
Rachel Hesson-Bolton, a 33-year-old driving instructor, said she was eager to be able to share the parenting responsibilities with her spouse, Katherine Hesson-Bolton, a 41-year-old fund-raiser, who recently gave birth to a boy with the help of a sperm bank. "I will be his mom, not his guardian," she said.
But Rachel said their marriage was more than about parenthood, adding: "I love the stability of our relationship. If there is one thing I can count on it's my family. We are so mainstream."
With her mohawk hairdo and her wedding band tattooed on her right biceps, Rachel looks anything but mainstream. The two are also an interracial couple who were married by a gay rabbi even though neither is Jewish. To Rachel, they also typify the melding of the married world with the gay and lesbian world.
"It's the people sitting home with their cats who are going to get married," she said. "They are already in the mind-set."
Tricia Lewis, a 42-year-old legal assistant, said she relished the mundane things that went along with her new marriage to Tanya Gulliver, a 34-year-old social justice worker at an Anglican church. She recalled entering a pharmacy near their home in Hamilton, Ontario, the other day to sign for a prescription for Tanya, who was waiting in their car.
"When I said to the pharmacist, 'I'll sign for it because we're married,' he laughed his head off," she said.
"I said, 'Dude, I hope you are laughing at something else.' He didn't know what to do, but I got the prescription," she said with a triumphant laugh.

HEADLINE: Governor McGreevey And His Energy Plan 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I concur with Governor McGreevey's assessment ("An Energy Plan," Soapbox, Aug. 24) regarding the need for continued investment in our electric infrastructure, and the responsibility of government and utilities to work collaboratively to achieve this goal. 
By doing so, we can ensure future energy availability and reliability for all our residents and businesses. 
 We are not likely to have a thorough analysis of the events of Aug. 14 for some time. But the blackouts remind all that growing demand in New Jersey and elsewhere cannot be supported in the long-term with existing resources and technology. The Governor's emphasis on continued energy infrastructure investment is precisely right. A robust and reliable electric network will advance and sustain our prosperous economy.

Got Milk? It'll Cost You

BYLINE:  By Elsa Brenner

 BODY:
Consumers should brace for a sharp increase in the price of milk, as much as 47 cents a gallon, the state Department of Agriculture and Markets said last week. 
 The increase is among the highest for a month-over-month period in more than 10 years, said Jessica Chittenden, a spokeswoman for the agency that regulates milk prices. 
 The new threshold for the cost per gallon has been set at $3.16 starting Sept. 1, up from $2.69 for August.
New York's price-gouging law says the highest price that can be charged at a particular time, called the threshold, is based on the wholesale price the federal government is paying farmers. 
Peter Fredericks, an economist with the United States Department of Agriculture, Northeast Milk Marketing Order, said a combination of factors was driving up prices. For example, he cited a downturn in milk production nationally as farmers respond to the low wholesale prices during the past 19 months, a hot and humid summer that causes cows to produce less, and an increase in demand for milk with the reopening of schools.

HEADLINE: A Tale of Two Shorelines 

BYLINE:  By CARIN RUBENSTEIN

 BODY:
AT the Larchmont Yacht Club one day not long ago, near the wide veranda of an elaborate Victorian clubhouse overlooking Long Island Sound, well-dressed parents and well-mannered children chatted on the deck of a sparkling pool. In the seawater below, boats rocked gently on the tide as further out in the haze, in a scene that might have been a backdrop in an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, a flotilla of sailboats raced in distant circles. 
 It was not quite as Gatsby-esque on an overcast Saturday at the minuscule Hudson River beach at the Philipse Manor Beach Club in Sleepy Hollow, just behind the Metro-North railroad station. There, a man wearing scruffy black water shoes climbed into a shiny white kayak and pushed off the muddy bank, while a pregnant woman played with her cranky 4-year-old in the coarse, sticky sand just north of the Tappan Zee bridge. Lifeguards watched languidly as a smattering of members ate at picnic tables, read or docked a small powerboat. 
 Westchester is surrounded by water and boats, and devotees of each side tend to resemble baseball fans who can root for the Mets or the Yankees, but never both. 
The two shores have many differences: The Long Island Sound side features exclusive yacht clubs and big boats, as well as pollution caused by sewage runoff that causes sporadic beach closings. The Hudson River side is characterized more by simpler boat clubs and smaller sailboats, plus silted-in marinas, industrial pollution and several high-profile organizations devoted to cleaning up the river.
Beyond the navigation and pollution differences caused by the two shores' distinctly different physical features, each side has its own culture, the Long Island Sound side boasting something of a Gold Coast feel, and the Hudson side with a more economically diverse river-town culture. 
On the Long Island Sound side of Westchester, there are about 40 marinas and yacht clubs, as well as 25 beaches, said Kimberly Zimmer, public outreach coordinator for the Long Island Sound Study at SUNY Stony Brook. From Pelham Manor to Port Chester, the wavy shoreline runs about 36 miles, she said. The harbors, on the whole, are deeper on the sound than they are on the river, and thus they tend to attract bigger boats.
On the Hudson River side of Westchester, there are 22 marinas and boat clubs and four separate beaches, the highest concentration anywhere on the river, said John Lipscomb, a boat captain for Riverkeeper, an environmental organization based in Garrison. From Yonkers to the Bear Mountain Bridge, the craggy Hudson River shoreline stretches 62 miles, said John W. Ladd, a board member of the Hudson River Environmental Society. 
Water recreation on the New York portion of the Long Island Sound coastline, which includes southern Westchester to Montauk, may generate as much as $1.2 billion in revenue annually, about one quarter of which is spent in Westchester County, according to an estimate by Chris Squeri, executive director of the New York Marine Trades Association in Amityville.
A total of 14,064 boats were registered to Westchester County residents in 2001, the sixth highest county total in the state, according to the most recent data available, provided by Jennifer Morris, a spokeswoman for the Department of Motor Vehicles in Albany. (The leaders, in order, are Suffolk and Nassau counties on Long Island, Monroe County on Lake Ontario, Erie County on Lake Erie and Onondaga County on Oneida Lake.)
"Boating is perceived to be a small industry, but it really isn't," said Ginny DiForio of the Hudson Valley Marine Trades Association in West Haverstraw. "People don't realize how much business it generates."
Most water lovers are attached to one side or the other, either by geography or by convenience. The contest about which shore is better is "the age-old question," said to Brian Plotkin, 24, who spends a great deal of time on his family's 48-foot power boat and helps his brother, Steve, run the Half Moon Bay Marina, on the Hudson side in Croton.
Mr. Plotkin is that rare, bi-coastal boater, a guy who docks on the Hudson but drives over to the Long Island Sound. This is no small decision, since it takes nearly $100 worth of fuel to get his three floating bedrooms and two baths to the other side. 
But he enjoys his weekly trips, he said, because "there's more to do on the sound, it has more coves and more restaurants." Also, his large boat is more well-suited to the wide-open Long Island Sound than to the relatively narrow Hudson, he said, echoing a common view that big boats belong on the sound.
Still, Mr. Plotkin and his boat, "Never Enough," sleep on the Hudson. "The Hudson River is very calm and easy and I always get a sense of relief when I turn out of Spuyten Duyvil on my way home," he said.
Part of the difference is in the water's character. Experienced boaters agreed that Hudson River waters tend to be more peaceful than the sound, which can be very temperamental.
"The Hudson is very calm, but the sound can go from nice to windy to really, really scary," said Steve Plotkin, manager of the Half Moon Bay Marina, which is unusually deep for the Hudson, about 8 1/2 feet at low tide. The marina has 173 slips, with a minimum starting price of $30,000. 
Other mariners agreed that boating on the Hudson is more scenic. But there is a great deal of commercial traffic there, including tugboats and huge tourist boats that can create large, dangerous wakes. The sound features hidden nooks and crannies, restaurants and serious fishing. 
Then, there's the thorny, and truly unresolvable, issue of which side is truly better.
"We don't have train tracks like they have over there that separate them from the water," said Bernard Rosenshein, president of the Mamaroneck Beach and Yacht Club. The Metro-North commuter line tracks run right up the riverbed on the Hudson line, making long stretches of shoreline difficult to reach for the Hudson River water clubs. (The flat riverbed made railroad construction relatively easy, and the Hudson River Railroad reached Peekskill by 1849, eventually driving the steamship companies out of business, according to the Westchester County Historical Society.) 
The boats on each side tend to be different, too. The water at many marinas on the Hudson is quite shallow at low tide, and is silting in at the rate of seven inches a year, which means the clubs can't accommodate large boats with a deep draft, said John H. Vargo, publisher of a monthly magazine, "Boating on the Hudson and Beyond." 
"Big sailboats have difficulty in most marinas on the Hudson River, and the silting is a serious problem," Mr. Vargo said. 
Dredging marinas on the Hudson River is costly, since the silt must first be tested for toxicity, and then treated and removed, Mr. Vargo said, which is why most river marinas choose not to fight the battle of the silt.
It takes money to own any kind of boat, of course, but it takes bigger money to have a boat on the sound, many boaters said.
"The corridor on the sound from Larchmont to Greenwich is economically one of the highest in the country," Mr. Rosenshein said, adding that, "I can't say the same for the Hudson side." His view of the difference between boats on the sound and on the Hudson, he said, is "a question of whether you have a Ferrari or a Chevrolet."
Clubs on the Hudson tend to be working clubs, in which members donate their time to maintain the property. Eugene Manzella, 82, who lives in Peekskill, keeps a 25-foot fishing boat at the Cortlandt Yacht Club, which has 170 boats on the Hudson River. "We all chip in with work," Mr. Manzella said. He added that he spends nearly all day at the club during the summer, answering phones and handing out homemade coffee and store-bought cake.
The seven-acre club has no restaurant, no cocktail lounge, no snack bar. Membership is limited to 100 members who share ownership, and 50 associate members. 
Yacht and boat clubs on the sound, for the most part, tend to be clubs in which members pay other people to do chores. 
"The clubs are far more expensive on the sound," Mr. Vargo said. At the Mamaroneck Beach and Yacht Club, for example, "our food is known throughout the area," Mr. Rosenshein said.
The Larchmont Yacht Club, which was built in 1880 and has 625 members with 316 boats, has three dining rooms, a bar, a grill, a snack bar, and an outdoor veranda. 
These are the kind of clubs where a love of sailing, as well as club membership, are passed down from generation to generation. John Lyons, a 56-year-old banker and a member of the Larchmont Yacht Club who lives in Mamaroneck, has been a member since his father joined in 1951. His oldest daughter, 13, races her own 14-foot sailboat, as did Mr. Lyons when he was a teenager. 
Several yacht club managers on the sound refused to discuss membership fees. One member of the Larchmont Yacht Club, who asked not to be identified, said that the initiation fee is $10,000, annual dues are $3,300, and there is a dining minimum of $120 a quarter, plus a mooring rental fee
A manager of the American Yacht Club in Rye, one of the most exclusive on the sound, refused to discuss the club with a reporter. 
Fishing on the two waterways also differs. Both sides have commercial fishing, including lobsters and oysters on the Long Island Sound and shad on the Hudson River, but recreational fishing is bigger business, said Mark Tedesco, director of the Environmental Protection Agency for Long Island Sound. Anglers there fish for striped bass, bluefish, tautog, flounder and porgies, although there are advisories on how much of the fish is safe to eat for pregnant women, he said. On the Hudson, the catch is striped bass, and shad during a brief spring season; women of childbearing age are advised to limit the amount they eat.
Swimming differs, too. While there are more swimming beaches on Long Island Sound than on the Hudson River, both sides have pollution problems and occasional beach closings. Swimming on both sides became appealing only in the mid- to late 1980's, when effective sewage plants were built and industrial pollution was curtailed.
Now, however, the public beach at Playland Park in Rye, one of the busiest on the Long Island Sound side, attracts about 2,600 swimmers each weekend, according to Peter Tartaglia, the park's director of marketing. 
From early spring to late fall, both river and sound are patrolled by police units, including Hudson River police departments in Yonkers and Peekskill, and the Long Island Sound police departments in New Rochelle, Mamaroneck, Rye City and Port Chester.
"People stop and ask me how they can get my job," said Andrew S. Landau, commanding officer of the village of Mamaroneck Police Marine Unit, who has been a water cop for 19 years, armed with a shotgun and a rifle, and the authority to enforce laws on any body of water in New York State.
"Any vessel with a motor has to be registered. If you have a log with a motor it has to be registered." He also enforces more obscure violations, such as "possession of mutilated lobsters," creatures missing a claw, for instance, and a ban on "water skiing between sunset and sunrise." 
On an overcast Sunday in August, Lieutenant Landau turned on the blue flashing lights of his 26-foot working boat with a 250-horsepower engine and pulled over a pale, blank-faced man smoking a cigar who said he did not know that a registration was supposed to be affixed to his inflatable boat. The lieutenant gave the man a warning. 
Marine units are also responsible for most water rescues. 
"It can be hellish on the water if you are not expecting a summer squall," said Sergeant Heine. He has sometimes tuned into the marine rescue channel and heard "wails and screaming from people on boats who think the world is ending," he said. 
One place you won't find water cops on their days off is on the water. 
"When I'm off the boat, I'm off the boat," said Lieutenant Landau. He avoids water, he said, "unless I'm swimming in it or playing over it on a golf course."

The Water's Cleaner, but Still ...
At the Philipse Manor Beach Club, on the Hudson River, the head lifeguard, Arley Morton, 18, said he has found a skinned cat, a headless seal and syringes. 
At the Manursing Island Club, on the Sound, an occasional dead deer, dead raccoon, or syringe washes up, said Alison Plati, longtime beach and pool director. Still, both bodies of water are cleaner now than they used to be. 
"The Hudson River is in magnificent condition," said John H. Vargo, publisher of a magazine about boating on the Hudson. Decades ago, he said, "I remember when you had to swim with one hand in front of you to push the debris away."
In the late 1960's, "the Hudson River was a virtual biological desert," agreed Cesare Manfredi, a retired engineer for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Several decades ago, he said, there was a continuous oil sheen on the water, and a factory near Peekskilldumped molasses waste into the river that was so thick "you couldn't get a boat into the water."
During the 1900's, Hudson pollutants included waste from the General Motors plant in Sleepy Hollow, the Anaconda Wire and Cable Company in Hastings, Standard Brands in Peekskill and General Electric in Fort Edward. Between 1947 and 1977, the General Electric plant leaked 1.3 million pounds of toxic PCBs into the river, and was ordered by the Environmental Protection Agency to clean up 40 remaining hot spots by the end of 2012, according to Manna Jo Greene of the Hudson River Sloop in Poughkeepsie, a group working to improve water quality. 
In the 1960's, several rivers flowing into the Sound "were literally open sewers," said Mr. Manfredi. The four Sound-side sewage treatment plants in Westchester County dumped barely treated sewage into the water. The water has improved, he added, although Mamaroneck still has sewage spills. 
Until the blackout on Aug. 14, only seven beaches, all on the sound, had been closed this summer, including Harbor Island, Shore Acres, Beachpoint, Mamaroneck Beach and Cabana, Orienta, Echo Bay and Hudson Park, according to the Westchester County Department of Health. After the blackout, the county closed all 56 county beaches as a precaution, including all those on the Long Island Sound, the Hudson River, and on inland lakes, according to Gabe Sganga, beach program director for the Bureau of Public Health. By Sunday, Aug. 17, all county beaches had been reopened, he said. CARIN RUBENSTEIN

HEADLINE: An Intimate 2d Stage Is Opening at McCarter 

BYLINE:  By JILL P. CAPUZZO

DATELINE: Princeton 

 BODY:
INSIDE the Roger S. Berlind Theater here, technicians wander around the purple-walled space checking lights and sound and marking their clipboards. Carpenters lay final swaths of maroon carpeting and install the last rows of seats. 
 Outside, landscapers are too busy planting replacement trees to even notice when the movie and television star Jimmy Smits walks by on his way to a rehearsal for "Anna in the Tropics," the play he will star in and the production that will open McCarter Theater's highly anticipated new stage. 
 Nearly five years in the making, the Berlind Theater, which officially opens on Sept. 9, provides a second stage for the McCarter Theater on the Princeton campus. Built on the south side of McCarter's existing building and facing the "dinky" train station, where students shuttle back and forth from campus, the new building includes a 380-seat theater, plus two large rehearsal spaces. At one-third the size of the original 1,100-seat McCarter Theater, the Berlind is expected to offer producers, directors and actors a new location for more experimental works, while providing audiences with a more intimate theater-going experience. 
 "The audience is all in one area, so the relationship is very intimate," said Jeffrey Woodward, the theater's managing director, as he stood on the 76-foot-wide stage looking out at the stadium-like auditorium, which includes no boxes or balcony. 'The actors can make eye contact with everyone here, which is thrilling."
 This 27,000-square-foot addition represents a new phase not only for McCarter, winner of the 1994 Tony Award for Outstanding Regional Theater, but also for Princeton's Program in Theater and Dance, which will share the new space with McCarter. 
 The $14.1 million building has been financed in equal parts by McCarter Theater Company, Princeton University, and the theater's namesake, the Tony-award winning Broadway producer Roger S. Berlind. A 1952 graduate of Princeton and former university trustee, Mr. Berlind first announced his plans to help finance the theater in 1998, after meeting with a group of theater students and asking them what they needed most. The unanimous response was more suitable performance space. The theater and dance program now operate out of a converted elementary school at 185 Nassau Street.
 "We needed a first stage as much as McCarter needed a second," said Michael Cadden, director of the university's Program in Theater and Dance, noting that his student actors are now performing in what was a basketball court that can accommodate an audience of just over 100 people. 
 With access to this larger professional space, Mr. Cadden said that everyone involved in the program would have to "up their game," getting away from the mind-set of black-box performances with limited sets, casts and staging, and looking instead toward more involved productions. He said they would also be marketing their productions for the first time to try to reach a wider audience than the students' family members or roommates.
 "You know your mom will always love you," Mr. Cadden said, "but the person who wanders in from Hamilton on a winter night, who has no real investment, will you be able to reach that person?"
 McCarter's artistic director, Emily Mann, said she has been waiting for a second stage since joining McCarter in 1990. She was most interested in how the new space would affect the connection between the performers and the audience. In an early meeting with architects, she demonstrated her desire by cupping her hands together.
 "We've been looking at this for a long time - how a space affects how a performance is presented and how it is received," she said recently. "The idea of having the actors and the audience all in the same room can really make for an electrifying experience."
 Ms. Mann is also thrilled by the two oversized windows in one of the rehearsal rooms, a luxury for most theaters.
 "Theater people live in the dark," she said. "The rehearsal space is usually underground, and they perform in a dark theater. Some haven't seen light for years." 
 The Berlind building was designed by Hugh Hardy, a 1952 Princeton graduate and founding partner of Hardy, Holtzman and Pfeiffer Associates, the New York architectural firm that has designed numerous theater and civic spaces, including the Wilma Theater in Philadelphia, the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center in New York and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Mr. Hardy said the goal with the Berlind Theater was to create a modern, functional space, in keeping with the theater's mission.
 "It is to be a place to explore things, to try out new things, and therefore it shouldn't be too luxurious," said Mr. Hardy. "The materials are very straightforward, not too posh or self-congratulatory."
 By using utilitarian objects in interesting design patterns, the architects were able to come up with something artistic but not too costly. In the lobby, the walls on one side are covered in pink, mauve and mocha squares of chipboard with a highly polished veneer. On the interior wall surrounding the theater, strips of corrugated brown wood are glued together to create what is now being referred to as "the wiggle wood wall." Inside the theater, the ceiling's metal lathing is exposed for all to view the overhead lighting grid. Industrial carpeting and multi-patterned seat cushions look like something one would find in an airport rather than a theater.
 "We weren't interested in gold finishes and high-end carpet," said Mr. Woodward. "We wanted to spend our money on volume -- a large rehearsal space and a high fly wall."
 The exterior of the Berlind Theater also reveals an effort to economize, using mostly brick finishes rather than the more expensive native stone facade of the original French Gothic structure. In a nod to McCarter's castle-like feel, the new building's elevator is enclosed in a hexagonal tower, to complement the 130-foot stone tower of the existing building.
 The original McCarter Theater was built in 1929, to provide a permanent venue for The Triangle Club, the university's all-male musical comedy troupe. It soon began serving as a jumping-off point for shows that were Broadway bound because of the theater's large capacity and proximity to New York. In 1973, Princeton transferred operations to the McCarter Theater Company. 
 Since Ms. Mann joined the company, McCarter has gained a reputation as one of the country's premier producing theaters, mounting new works by playwrights like Athol Fugard, Stephen Wadsworth and John Henry Redwood. Throughout the year, McCarter also presents a wide range of music, dance and children's productions. 
 The Berlind's first production, Nilo Cruz's "Anna in the Tropics", which won the Pulitzer Prize for drama this year, will have a six-week run beginning next Tuesday. After that, the university will take over the space with a production of Charles Mee's "Big Love," during which time the McCarter company will move to the larger Matthews Stage, where the company will be presenting another Charles Mee play, "Wintertime."
 In January, McCarter moves back to the Berlind with "Fraulein Else," an adaptation of the novella by Arthur Schnitzler. Then the Berlind goes back to the students, with their spring dance festival, followed by McCarter's season closer, an innovative rendition of "My Fair Lady."

HEADLINE: In Trying Times, Many Ways To Ask, Will You Hire Me? 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER S. STEWART

 BODY:
JOBLESS for two years now, Michael Walker has sent out roughly 2,400 resumes, gone on 18 interviews with no offers and drained both his savings account and his 401(k). "I have a standing offer that I'll pay $2,000 cash to the person who refers me to a full-time job," said Mr. Walker, a software engineer from Seattle who is in his 40's. 
 Before being laid off, Mr. Walker worked for Honeywell and made $105,000 a year; now he is applying for internships, offering his 22 years of professional experience free. So far, there have been no takers. "I'm seriously considering standing by the freeway off-ramp with a sandwich board that says 'Software Engineer Wants Job -- Will Work Cheap,"' he said. "It would be a long shot, but at this point I have nothing left to lose." 
 Desperation appears to be the order of the day, with unemployment at a nine-year high. About 25 percent of the nine million Americans counted as unemployed have been out of work for more than 27 weeks, according to the Department of Labor. In some of the hardest-hit industries, like technology, finance and manufacturing, many white-collar workers have been out of work two years or and more.
"These times are rife with the temptation to do extreme things," said Andrew Sherwood, chairman of the human resources firm Goodrich & Sherwood Associates, which is based in New York. "More and more, necessity is a driver. Job seekers have moved from the cocky 'buy me if you like' approach of the 90's to doing and saying whatever it takes to get a job." 
The hard-knocks atmosphere has led DiMassimo Brand Consultancy, a New York City advertising firm, to conjure up a job competition styled after the "Survivor" reality TV show. Starting Sept. 15, 10 contestants, all eager for an entry-level job at the agency, will move into DiMassimo's Madison Avenue office, which will be renamed DiMassimo Island for the occasion. 
Over several days, they will compete in a range of advertising-related tasks, including an "all-nighter" to put together an ad proposal and make attempts to get a meeting with the chief executive of a company whose account DiMassimo has been trying to land. DiMassimo executives will vote contestants off the island every night until they have a winner. The last person standing earns the entry-level position, with an initial salary of $25,000 to $30,000. 
Marc DiMassimo, chief executive and creative director of the company, said that the competition, which starts in September, reflects the current job market. "It's tough out there," he said. "And this is a time to break rules.
"We're not going to denigrate or degrade people. But somebody else's idea of humiliation isn't the same as mine. If anything, the challenge makes for an interesting way to spend a week trying to get a job. And, hopefully, the contestants will get some attention for it."
Karine Ng, 23, said she had sent out about 50 resumes in the last three months with no response. She is an applicant for the DiMassimo job. "It would be a pretty unique way to get a position," she said. "In these creative industries, a lot of people intern. I just think of this as an intensive weeklong internship with a slumber party excursion thrown in." 
Certainly there are many job seekers willing to do whatever it takes to land a position, even if it means losing a little dignity. People in positions to hire say a growing number of applicants are using oddball tactics to attract attention.
Stephan Schiffman did not even have a position open when a Washington man recently showed up without warning at his Manhattan sales training company, the DEI Management Group. Though the man was denied entry, he refused to leave the downstairs lobby, where he waited for the next two hours, even after security was called. In the end, Mr. Schiffman saw the man to appease him.
"He claimed he wanted to talk about a book that I'd written, but he ended up begging for a job," Mr. Schiffman recalled. "He was completely wired, bouncing off the walls. Even if we'd had something available, he wasn't qualified."
Another man, after being turned down for a position at DEI's Huntington Beach, Calif., office, came to work anyway. "He hired himself," Mr. Schiffman said. "Some of the managers were away after the interview and the people just assumed that he'd gotten the job." Like everyone else working there, he came and went from 9 to 5, spending a total of a week or so blending into the ordinary rhythms of office life before he was finally discovered and asked to leave. 
Steven D. Austin, chief marketing officer of Zacks Investment Research in Chicago, said he had recently seen a significant uptick in unusual job hunting tactics. Earlier this year, he was interviewing a man for a sales job when the applicant produced a handful of articles that he said had been written about him in various financial trade publications. As an added gesture, he included a few pictures of himself with well-known executives like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York. "The guy definitely wanted me to know he was an accomplished stud," Mr. Austin said.
But when Mr. Austin went to the library to check up on the applicant, he found that not one story had actually been written about the man. As for the pictures, Mr. Austin said, "For all I know, he probably walked up to Bloomberg and asked to pose with him."
Experts warn against approaches that are too unorthodox. "When thinking in extremes, you immediately narrow the window of opportunity," said Damian Birkel, founder of Professionals in Transition Support Group Inc., a nonprofit organization in Winston-Salem, N.C., that assists laid-off workers. 
Last March, Mr. Birkel met a woman who had arrived at an interview carrying a pot of shamrocks and her resume taped to a dozen balloons. It was St. Patrick's Day -- but her gesture did not resonate. 
Still, every so often, an extreme gambit works. "Sometimes, I sympathize with desperate people," Mr. Schiffman said. "Some of them are hungrier and more motivated than others. And I think 'let's give the guy a break."'
That is what Mr. Walker is hoping for. He has the enthusiasm and the experience. But he has yet to find a responsive employer, and his failure to land a job is forcing him to consider the sale of his home. "This is really turning into a problem," Mr. Walker said. "The last six months, I've become really desperate. If there's a moral here, I haven't found it yet."

Nascar Goes Beyond Roots, And Southerners See Betrayal

BYLINE:  By VIV BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: DARLINGTON, S.C., Aug. 29 

 BODY:
United States and Confederate flags sail above campers and RV's, dotting the landscape around Darlington Raceway as fans gather for Sunday's Mountain Dew Southern 500. The flags are as much a part of the Nascar racing scene in the South as country music and Sunday chapel.
 Nascar was born in the Southeast and embraced, nurtured and adopted as part of the Southern heritage. But stock-car racing has gone national, with a multibillion-dollar network television deal and a new sponsorship with Nextel beginning next season. 
 In 1996, 20 of 31 races were held in the Southeast. Starting in 2004, half the races will be run in different regions of the United States. Although Nascar has accommodated the boom by adding to the schedule, now up to 36 races, it continues to branch out.
In the latest move, North Carolina Speedway in Rockingham will lose one of its two races next season. Darlington will gain Rockingham's November date for the Southern 500, and California Speedway in Fontana, which is outside Los Angeles, will take the Labor Day race weekend.
"We feel like the growth of the sport, the oversaturation that exists in the southeastern United States, complemented that whole thought process of taking advantage of the same amount of race dates we are running," Nascar's president, Mike Helton, said, "but them being in areas where there is not a saturation to get more exposure in more major markets."
That might suit Nascar's national ambitions -- and soothe its sponsors -- but it has angered fans in the Southeast who feel abandoned and betrayed. Darlington has held the Southern 500 every Labor Day weekend since 1950. This is the last year it will be held this holiday weekend. "It needs to stay right here," said Robert Grissom of Wilmington, N.C., as he sat next to his RV outside the raceway. "It's been here for 50 years. It's one of the oldest tracks here."
There has been speculation about more moves in the future, and Gov. Mike Easley of North Carolina went so far as to race three laps at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C., this year to rally support for keeping the annual all-star race there amid concerns it would be moved.
Helton has heard the outcry.
"I'm sorry they feel that way," he said of fan criticism, "because I think there's no form of sports, certainly not in motorsports, that understands, relies on and believes in its tradition and heritage as does Nascar. But you look at the concentration of races in the southeastern part of the United States and the lack of their ability to sell all the tickets because of the saturation of the events. It doesn't mean we're forsaking tradition or giving up on our heritage. In order to grow the sport beyond where it is today, we need to make smart decisions and I think the results will speak for themselves."
Those decisions might be smart for Nascar, but they can be devastating for communities that rely on those races. North Wilkesboro Speedway in northwestern North Carolina used to play host to two Winston Cup races each season. But the track was sold to O. Bruton Smith and Bob Bahre and, after 1996, Smith moved one of the race dates to Texas Motor Speedway and Bahre took the other for New Hampshire International Speedway. North Wilkesboro Speedway has been vacant since.
"It affected not only North Wilkesboro, but the entire area and other counties too," said Faye Cox, the North Wilkesboro mayor pro-tem. "It really affected our economy to the tune of millions of dollars."
Residents in Rockingham, which has had two races a year since 1966, are bracing for that, too.
"Our community's a textile community," Bennett Deane, the president of the Richmond County chamber of commerce, said. "We have felt the affect of Nafta. It's kind of like getting hit when we're already down. And it's disappointing. We felt like we were a victim of Nascar's success. We were a part of the success growing it and getting it to this point, and we're kind of getting left behind."
The reaction in Darlington has been mixed. Although some are upset the Southern 500 is being moved to another date, there is relief that Nascar did not switch either of Darlington's two races to another track. Darlington isalso host of the Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 in March.
"Realists understand it's a business decision Nascar made for their good," Charles Hardin, the chairman of the Darlington County development board, said. "Our reaction is, we've got two races for 2004, that's a good thing. We're going to get lights, that's a good thing. November is not a high traffic month for hotel and restaurants and could be a real pick-me-up. I think it's going to be a plus."
For now. Realists also understand that Nascar is probably not done, and Helton acknowledged there could be more changes. Realignment will most likely continue to affect tracks throughout the Southeast.
"Money's driving the sport," the driver Bill Elliott said. "Now it's to the bigger markets, the bigger money. It's unfortunate, but on the other hand, for the kind of sponsors we need, you need to be in the bigger markets. It's a Catch-22. You're in a situation you can't do anything about. There's going to be good and bad in the growth."

HEADLINE: East End Agriculture's Lost Link to Chinatown 

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN S. TOY

DATELINE: Peconic 

 BODY:
BOSTON lettuce and fresh basil sit in baskets next to baby bok choy and kohlrabi. Chocolate chip cookies and scones from a Southampton bakery share shelf space with soy sauce and black bean garlic sauce. It's hardly a typical Long Island farm stand, and Sang Lee Farms, in Peconic, is hardly a typical Long Island farm.
 Sang Lee was once the biggest grower of Asian vegetables in the New York region. For several decades, when the average American's knowledge of Chinese food meant an occasional encounter with canned chow mein, Sang Lee fed fresh Chinese greens to the growing populations in Chinatowns stretching from Toronto to Washington. 
 But now that bok choy and sui choy, or nappa cabbage, can be found in the produce aisles of supermarkets across the country, and farmers as far away as Canada and South America have gotten into the business, Sang Lee has moved out of the increasingly fierce competition for the Chinese markets in North America. 
 Fred and Karen Lee, the current owners of Sang Lee, stopped trucking vegetables to Chinatown in Manhattan two years ago, and like many Long Island farmers they have significantly diversified their crops, leaving only about 5 percent of the farm's 165 acres dedicated to Asian vegetables. The farm stand nonetheless has a distinctly Chinese flavor, and perhaps precisely because the American palate has heartily embraced ethnic foods, the farm stand now accounts for roughly half of Sang Lee's income. The rest of the farm's produce is sold to Long Island distributors, who then sell to local restaurants and markets.
 The changes mark the end of an era not just for Sang Lee but also for Chinese food markets all along the Northeastern seaboard. For half a century, Sang Lee trucks were a familiar sight to Chinese Americans who lived in or frequented Chinatowns in the Northeast, and this small slice of Long Island became a crucial cultural link for hundreds of thousands of people.
 Sang Lee thrived in part because of the relative isolation of Chinatowns and their markets. But growing a specialty product could not protect Sang Lee forever from the economic trends that have forced many other Long Island farmers out of business. To survive, the Lees eventually adopted the changes that had saved other conventional Long Island farms: they switched their emphasis from wholesale to retail and started growing things they had never before contemplated.
 The decision to remake Sang Lee was a difficult one, Mr. Lee said. "We're one of the oldest Asian farms around, and we had an established reputation," he said. "I struggled with the issue, but it came down to a matter of economics. We just couldn't compete in the Chinese markets anymore."
 Mr. Lee said the shift was "like the evolution of smaller family farms all over the United States." Many of Long Island's longtime potato farmers, for example, have become sod farmers or sold their land to grape growers. "There have been major changes in the farm industry," Mr. Lee said. "You do what you have to do."
 George Lee, Mr. Lee's father, started Sang Lee in Melville in 1948 with his brother, John, and a cousin. There was never anyone actually named Sang Lee, which means growth and prosperity in Chinese. "You know how Chinese are," said Eunice Tan, Fred Lee's mother, who remarried after his father died in 1980. "They like to pick a name that means something."
 George Lee grew up in Queens, ironing shirts after school in the back of his parents' Chinese laundry. Mrs. Tan said he decided to study agriculture at the State University of New York at Farmingdale after serving in the Navy during World War II. She said his parents, immigrants from Canton (now Guangzhou), approved of his career choice. "In those days, being a farmer was different than in China, where it was considered low," Mrs. Tan said. "Here, they knew you had to have an education and know what you're doing."
 From the beginning, the Lees set out to do things differently. There were several Asian vegetable farms in central New Jersey at the time, but they opted for Long Island, Fred Lee said, "because they didn't want to be in the same pack." They figured that when New Jersey faced drought, they would have a competitive advantage because they could irrigate from Long Island's vast underground aquifer. "They were irrigating from way back, and that was the key to their growth," he said.
 They drove their own trucks, filled with crates of bok choy, guy lan (Chinese broccoli), and u choy (Chinese flowering cabbage), into Chinatown, stopping to make deliveries to Chinese restaurants on the Island. "There were only a few dozen Chinese restaurants back then," Fred Lee said. "Not like today where there's one next to every pizza place in every strip mall."
 Business was much simpler in the early years, Mrs. Tan said. "The market was good, and they almost monopolized Chinatown in those days," she said.
 In 1950, Chinatown encompassed about eight blocks in Lower Manhattan and had a population of about 10,000 people, a fraction of the 40 blocks and the close to 100,000 who live there now, said Fay Chew Matsuda, the executive director of the Museum of Chinese in the Americas.
 "It must have been quite a big undertaking for them to go out and start a Chinese vegetable farm in Long Island when no one else had done it," Ms. Matsuda said. "But maybe it wasn't as extraordinary a decision as it would seem now, because opportunities in other professions probably weren't open to them."
 The Lees also trucked their produce to Chinatowns in Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, Montreal and Toronto. Rather than leave their trucks idle during the winter months, the Lees started farming in Palm Beach Gardens in Florida and trucked Chinese vegetables north during New York's off season. "They were one of the main farms back then, and they were the only ones who could supply year round," said Gordon Lau, of Lau N. Son Produce, a vegetable wholesaler in Chinatown.
 Sang Lee moved to a larger farm in East Moriches in 1963 before moving to its current location in 1987. At its peak, Sang Lee farmed some 400 acres on Long Island, about half of it in bok choy and the rest in a dozen other varieties of Chinese vegetables. Like other farmers, the Lees hired successive waves of migrant workers, first Puerto Ricans, then Mexicans and more recently Guatemalans. But they also always used Chinese workers, often distant relatives and friends of relatives.
 Growing up in East Moriches, Fred Lee said that there were no other Chinese families around and that he was the only Asian at Westhampton Beach High School in the late 1960's. "I can remember getting into fights and being called names," he said. "But it was nothing that scarred me. It was no different than kids being teased because they were too skinny or they had red hair."
 When his father died in 1980, Fred Lee and his cousin Richard Lee took over the farm. In that decade, as the number of Chinese immigrants grew and satellite Chinatowns started to thrive in Brooklyn and Queens, several Chinese vegetable farms opened on Long Island.
 But their days were numbered. While the Chinatown markets along the Eastern Seaboard had always been relatively closed markets, supplied mainly by local farms run by Chinese or Chinese Americans, competition grew more intense in the 1980's. Produce started coming from California, Mexico and Central and South America in the wintertime, as did vegetables from Canada during the summer season.
 Sang Lee scaled down its operations and stopped farming in Florida in the late 1980's. Richard Lee got out of the family business in 1992 and started a greenhouse operation, growing perennials in East Moriches. Canadian farmers drove prices down, and the more sophisticated tastes of Chinese immigrants and changing restaurant trends also made it harder to compete, he said.
 "The old-time Cantonese were just grateful to have bok choy, but people don't eat it anymore," Richard Lee said. Immigrants from Taiwan, Hong Kong and other parts of China in the 1980's demanded more variety, and suburban Chinese takeout restaurants stopped using bok choy as a filler in their stir-frys and replaced it with less expensive broccoli crowns they would buy from non-Asian suppliers.
 Fred Lee said that Sang Lee Farms never shied away from competition, "but it's really knucklehead stuff now," and that prices dropped significantly after the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1994 ended most restrictions on imports from Canada and Mexico.
 In New Jersey, farmers growing Asian vegetables still seem to be thriving, but only because they grow less-common vegetables, said Bill Sciarappa, the agricultural agent for the Rutgers Cooperative Extension of Monmouth County.
 Some of the New Jersey farmers are focused on things like Asian pears, Asian cucumbers and edamame, a soybean used primarily in Japanese cooking. "Small farms experimenting with Asian crops is where the action is, rather than the big commodity market of bok choy and cabbages," he said.
 Aside from Sang Lee, there is at least one other large farm on Long Island growing Asian vegetables, Windy Acres Farm in Calverton. Tom Funfgeld, the owner, switched from corn to Asian greens two years ago after his neighbor, Ngen Lee, retired. Ngen Lee had worked at Sang Lee before opening his own farm in 1981, and he sold Mr. Funfgeld some of his equipment and introduced him to his Chinatown wholesaler. "Mr. Lee opened the door for me," Mr. Funfgeld said. "I think Fred thinks I'm crazy, but I haven't lost money on the Chinese vegetables the way I did on pumpkins and sweet corn."
 Sang Lee, on the other hand, had suffered several years of losses when Fred Lee decided to pull out of Chinatown. By 1998, when Karen Lee first started the farm stand, Fred Lee had alreadydiversified Sang Lee's crops significantly. Today, instead of the dozen-odd varieties of Asian vegetables his father started with, Fred Lee grows nearly 250 varieties of plants, including 35 different potted herbs, 40 varieties of tomatoes, 6 kinds of eggplant and unusual items like yellow carrots and red scallions. "They're the kinds of things that a high-end restaurant looking for something different and aesthetic might want," Karen Lee said.
 Business at the farm stand has grown significantly in the last five years, and many of the customers are regulars who know Mrs. Lee by name. The Lees' three children, ages 20, 17 and 14, are often found behind the counter. "I add the American spin that makes this all marketable," said Mrs. Lee, who is of Irish descent. "But Fred's the one with the easy temperament holding it all together."
 Having worked alongside her husband for the last 10 years, she said, she has come to realize that "to do this, you have to believe that what you're doing makes sense in the larger scope of life, because if you live day to day, it's real easy to get discouraged." Both Mr. and Mrs. Lee have business degrees and could be pursuing other careers, she said, "but we believe in what we do."
 Mr. Lee said he wonders what his father would think of his decision to move away from farming Asian vegetables. "I don't think he'd be disappointed," he said. "He always said, 'If you do anything, do it well, or don't do it all."'

 THE chilly knack of managing unsavory deals is the key to what distinguishes political winners from losers. Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York owed his nomination for president in 1932 to a bargain with William Randolph Hearst, who controlled the California and Texas delegations to the Democratic National Convention. Hearst had his chips on the speaker of the House, John Nance Garner of Texas. Roosevelt needed Hearst's support to win the nomination. He got it for the price of taking Garner as his running mate, plus assurances to Hearst that he was no Wilsonian internationalist. 
Bill Clinton, the only Democrat since Roosevelt to win two presidential terms, owed re-election in great part to the political pollster and consultant Dick Morris. Morris guided the Clintons' political recovery when they slipped in Arkansas in the early 80's. Subsequently he was a hired gun for, among others, the 1988 Bush campaign and for two Republican Senators, Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Trent Lott of Mississippi -- with time out for phone calls from the Clintons. Late in 1994, having lost Congress to the Republicans and Hillary's health care project to conceit, they summoned Morris to the White House. In short order the presidential strategy became "triangulation," moving the president to the center and right, stealing Republican thunder, pulling swing voters, saving the Clintons -- at the price of reinforced doubts about Bill Clinton's political integrity.
In 1997 Morris wrote of "Clinton's manifest passion to do well for the country." Graciously he protested that though "the press has given me much credit for" winning the 1996 election, "the mind behind the victory was that of President William Jefferson Clinton." How time flies! Morris proclaims now, "For years, Bill Clinton swept" warnings about three impending threats -- Iraq, North Korea and Al Qaeda -- "under the White House rug as they grew more dangerous and more immediate. And so, lest he reach too early for the role of Democratic spokesman, I call upon us all to look at his record on terrorism and join me in calling: OFF WITH HIS HEAD!" 
Clinton, Morris writes, is "a moral relativist," and here he would seem to be an authority. Morris worked with Clinton in the 1992 New Hampshire primary campaign to handle revelations about the candidate's draft record; he says now that Clinton's draft evasion in the Vietnam years was "a silent inhibition that consistently held him back from aggressive military commitment" as president. And, with a raging alcoholic for a father, Clinton was blind to the difference between Good and Evil, Morris suggests, for the president grew up with a fear of setting off anger in others. Thus, "all our terrorist problems were born during the Clinton years." 
Other perpetrators on Morris's list are "the Hollywood apologists" of terrorism, "opposing our efforts to disarm Iraq and protect the safety of the world"; The New York Times, "the drummer whose cadence governs the step of the march against President Bush's battle to fight terrorism"; and an array of selfish, misanthropic forces that it would seem he has polled for, against or around, such as the tobacco and nursing home industries; and France, with "appeasement" and "perfidy" deep in its "soul and psyche." (Having polled there, Morris writes that 34 percent of the nation backs extremists. "So, to begin with, one French voter in three is nuts.")
"OFF WITH THEIR HEADS!"
That's the tone of voice here. (Lewis Carroll is credited, removing any confusion with the French Revolution.) The bloodthirstiness of this book's title and rhetoric logically prompts doubt whether Morris should be taken seriously. His White House rivals took him very seriously, because he and his thinking were hard-wired to the president and the first lady. George Stephanopoulos understood that "Morris had a strong fix on Clinton's psychology. His focus on swing voters was solid analysis that appealed to the president's intellect; his obsession with the timing was superstition that inflamed the president's insecurities." Sidney Blumenthal saw him as "an unbalanced person who helped Clinton to achieve a political equilibrium." 
To every little Beltway thing there is a season: a time to heal (that was in Morris's "Behind the Oval Office: Winning the Presidency in the Nineties," in which the author offered "a public apology" to his wife, Clinton, Al Gore and White House staffers for "my grave lapse of moral standards" -- a scandal involving a prostitute) and a time to settle scores. For Morris, this seems to be that time. 
Morris here indicts The New York Times/CBS News Poll (most of the time he leaves out CBS) as a creature of the liberal predilections of the former Times executive editor, Howell Raines (he gets his title wrong, repeatedly calling him managing editor). The Times "has become like a political consulting firm for the Democratic Party," he charges of the newspaper that the Clinton White House saw as a mortal enemy for, among other offenses, its coverage of the Whitewater affair. 
Morris throws many accusations widely, but the one meant to be most incendiary is that "in every single survey" from Jan. 1, 2002, to the election that year, "the number of Democrats 
interviewed is weighted up . . . while 
the number of Republicans interviewed is weighted down." In Morris's rendering, The Times used misleading poll findings to skew news coverage suggesting that wars in Afghanistan and Iraq would be long, bloody and risky; to mount an "obsessive" campaign about abuse of American civil liberties in a time of fear; and to push corporate scandals and the economy as more compelling issues than terrorism. Worse, The Times's power as a national paper feeds the skeptical hauteur of "their majesties Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings," and sends ripples "touching scores of other, more local, news organs." 
Happily, The Times's "Democratic clients" followed its bias into their losing 2002 Congressional election strategy. Morris exults: "The American media establishment has blundered. . . . In its attempt to tell us what to think, it has let us see the strings with which it manipulates us, and we don't like it one bit. The era of media dominance of our political system has lasted 40 years, ever since the news organizations brought down first Johnson and then Nixon. . . . Now, it appears, it has overstayed its welcome; its reign is ending. In its place will arise the cacophony of divergent voices that truly constitutes free speech and a free press." 
A part from understanding that "weighting" is an instrument of self-correction (that is, for adjusting findings to achieve representational demographic balances), I am not expert in the refinements of modern polling. I hasten to refer readers to a searching exploration of Morris's charges by Timothy Noah in Slate for May 28, 2003, which includes interviews with Times and CBS polling managers (Morris apparently did not speak to any) and with others in the profession. It turns out that despite Morris's charges of systematic methodological bias, the Times/CBS News polls were actually right on the nose in the last two national elections. For all his thunder, Morris does not hold Times/CBS News poll results up to comparable measures and show them to be flawed. 
In any event, having edited a major metropolitan newspaper and worked in the Senate and for a secretary of state, I do have some experience with the argument that "the American media establishment" has long dominated our political system, that it "brought down first Johnson and then Nixon," and so forth. An understandable instinct on the part of people in public life, as well as of citizens addicted to Morris's "cacophony of divergent voices" on radio and cable television, is to magnify the power of major news organizations, and to see their work as a seamless web of well-laid concept and execution, as if the news were played on a great cathedral organ. The life of the newsroom is quite different. Yes indeed, a deplorable newsroom tendency is to allow debatable poll findings to drive some news coverage, but polling tides and newsroom dispute wash in and out. More to the point, what occurred in the years since Vietnam and Watergate was not a consolidation of media power in relation to those in high office but a diffusion of it. The press contributed greatly to the unraveling of Johnson's and Nixon's presidencies, and became a prime target of their anger, blame and punishment (in Nixon's case). But the disasters that played out in the news were rooted in decisions made in the Oval Office, and by those carrying out presidential policies. Beneath Morris's blunderbuss case that The Times has "stooped" to the role of "sending messages of dissent, and fanning the flames of disagreement on the left" is the trail from the Alien and Sedition Acts to the effort to suppress publication of the Pentagon Papers by The Times and The Washington Post: the reflex notion, so convertible to repression, that forceful, critical, skeptical inquiry of government in time of crisis and war is a threat to the national interest. 
Political history since the Vietnam and Watergate years is in no small part the story of how, in an ever more intensive media ether, successful political campaigns and powerful bureaucracies, like the military, have gone to school in media management. In a contest about who is higher up in command of the levers of modern media politics, it's the political and governmental managers, supple, quick, manipulative and "on message," who have the edge on responsible news organizations, saddled as they are with reactive, catch-up reflexes, internal confusion and turf scuffling, and laborious newsroom argument about whether the story is there. Major exceptions occur when politicians like Bill Clinton, and political consultants like Dick Morris, inflict terrible wounds on themselves. Then the balance of power shifts away from political media management; frenzy indeed. But the press is not the planter; it plucks up that which is planted. 
In the end, Clinton's on-and-off handler, Morris, is reminiscent of Roosevelt's partner for a season, Hearst. Like the erratic Hearst, Morris blends populism, progressivism, opportunism, jingoism and a taste for revenge. Like Hearst, he could ally with more purposefully liberal-minded agents of change, but not for long. The ironies of press barons' foibles and alliances deserve mention in one other respect. The mighty Hearst, as his biographers record and "Citizen Kane" dramatized, never got what he wanted or kept what he got. Dick Morris, who once told President Clinton what to do and brokered his deals with Congressional Republican leaders, now appearing in over-the-top mode on Fox News, in The New York Post and under the ReganBooks/HarperCollins imprint, has become a multimedia Rupert Murdoch production. 
Joe Conason is a columnist for The New York Observer, which is a most welcome 
local weekly alternative voice to The Times. 
A devout liberal and aspiring watchdog, Conason is also, like Morris, something of a populist, and his book too is couched in the kill-or-be-killed cries of political war. Like Morris, he is a veteran of combat in Clinton's cause, but remains in uniform. (His previous book, with Gene Lyons, was "The Hunting of the President: The Ten-Year Campaign to Destroy Bill and Hillary Clinton.") Unlike Morris, Conason is not an outlandish, excessive personality or writer, and his new book, "Big Lies: The Right-Wing Propaganda Machine and How It Distorts the Truth," is sometimes factually arresting. But it relies for firepower on linear recitations and earnest pieties, along with a stream of pumped-up terms like "loony," "bilious," "smarmily" and "nightmarish," some of which get tangled (Senator Trent Lott is "clueless" and "smooth" in the same paragraph). 
Conason writes that "the G.O.P.'s gray-suited lobbyists and officials are now fronted by a virtual zoo of Republican party animals" -- the roster of Rush Limbaugh, Matt Drudge, Laura Ingraham, Ann Coulter ("carping harpies") and the rest, who have fixed a curse on liberalism. His project is to undo their "vicious propaganda" and expose hypocrisy, as on the part of "flag-flapping" Republicans who themselves avoided the draft but "scream 'treason' " at Democrats who question George W. Bush's foreign and military policies. His chapter on "crony capitalism" -- the web of deals, ventures and profiteering on the part of President Bush, his family members and their allies -- is worth the price of the book, but it's drawn entirely from newspaper, magazine and Web site accounts, and from other books. 
Finally, stridency depletes itself fast. To live on, a dissident voice needs the gift of an unexpected twist of argument, and skill at coup de grace. Conason wonders what a Moliere or Mark Twain would make of the "phony Puritanism" of today's "reactionary clowns," and bows in Mencken's direction. But his writing lacks their panache, or that of the late master of dissident journalism on the left, Murray Kempton, who practiced a perverse appreciation of his villains, the more artfully to drive the blade home. Of a much darker figure than George W. Bush, Kempton once wrote, "Mr. Nixon . . . will, with time, be a landmark in the history of quiet, determined desperation."

HEADLINE: Tough Start to the School Year 

 BODY:
Many of the 50 million American children who return to public school this week will be carrying a good deal more than lunch boxes. Faced with a dismal economy and deep budget cuts, some schools are asking families to contribute basic supplies like paper, pencils and even soap. Others are charging students steep fees to join athletic teams. Worst of all, teacher layoffs are driving up class sizes and jeopardizing enrichment programs that have been shown to improve student performance. 
 Almost every state and a great many localities are suffering from budget crises this year. That should not become an excuse for abandoning the national effort to raise standards and improve the schools that was set in motion by the federal No Child Left Behind Act. But keeping reform on track will be impossible if President Bush and his party continue to mandate expensive new reforms without providing the money to get the job done. 
 When the Bush administration first indicated that it wanted to require states to eliminate the achievement gap between rich and poor students by 2014, states with large poor populations were hesitant, believing that the federal government would never ante up the necessary dollars. This turned out to be the case, when the House shortchanged No Child Left Behind byabout 30 percent, providing $6 billion less than Congress originally called for when it authorized the bill.
The White House has played the same game of bait and switch with Head Start, the valuable federal education program that prepares underprivileged 3- and 4-year-olds for kindergarten. Any serious effort to close the achievement gap between rich and poor children should begin by strengthening and expanding Head Start, which now serves only about a million children. But the Head Start bill that was spirited through the House last month can be reasonably described as perhaps the worst, most penurious version since the program was created in 1965. It dramatically raises the educational requirements for Head Start teachers but provides no money for training or salaries. It also includes a financing cap that does not even keep up with inflation.
School reform is a long, incremental progress that requires a well-financed effort, sustained over time. Setting lofty goals while failing to back them up with the needed cash is worse than doing nothing at all. It breeds cynicism and hopelessness, reinforcing the mediocre status quo. If the administration continues along its current path, the opportunity for school reform will surely slip away.

HEADLINE: Cries of Activism and Terrorism in S.U.V. Torching 

BYLINE:  By NICK MADIGAN

DATELINE: WEST COVINA, Calif., Aug. 30 

 BODY:
To some people, Hummers, those mastodons of the highway, are a joyous extravagance -- big, safe and fun to drive.
 To others, they are simply wasteful, toys with testosterone that symbolize the American penchant for self-indulgence. But such detractors do not usually back their objections with fire. 
 A week ago, in the middle of the night, 20 new Hummer H2's worth about $50,000 apiece were set aflame and destroyed at a car dealership here, part of a wave of vandalism in which 50 other vehicles had been damaged at the same dealership and others in the suburbs east of Los Angeles. 
To many of the 106,000 in this community near the San Gabriel Mountains, the notion of domestic terrorism at their doorsteps was, at the very least, jarring.
"Whether terrorist act or just vandalism, it was an offense against the community," West Covina's assistant fire chief, Jerry Johnson, said.
Whoever broke into the Clippinger dealership in the early hours of Aug. 22 left behind a calling card in addition to the damage. Many of the vehicles were spray-painted with the words "gross polluter" and "fat, lazy Americans." Some had the letters "ELF" spray-painted on them, and the Earth Liberation Front, a militant environmentalist group, later claimed responsibility.
The group, founded in England a decade ago and shunned by mainstream environmentalist groups, also claimed responsibility for a $50 million fire on Aug. 1 that destroyed a construction site for 1,500 apartments near the campus of the University of California at San Diego. A banner left at the site, signed ELF, said, "You build it -- we burn it."
The car dealership fires have commanded the most attention from the news media, law enforcement agencies and politicians, including one involved in the California recall election.
"What these people are doing isn't activism -- it is vandalism, and I strongly oppose it," said Arianna Huffington, one of the candidates seeking to replace Gov. Gray Davis. "I have nothing against S.U.V. owners; my problem is with Detroit. The automakers have the technology to make more fuel-efficient S.U.V.'s, and that is what consumers deserve."
Ms. Huffington is a former sport utility vehicle owner who turned against the vehicles, claiming in part that by using so much gas they fostered terrorism in the Middle East.
At the Federal Bureau of Investigation office in Los Angeles, technicians were working late this week to enhance images on a surveillance videotape that shows two men spray-painting graffiti on vehicles -- also on the night of Aug. 22 -- at an auto dealership in Duarte, another suburb in the San Gabriel Valley.
"We feel confident we'll have a successful conclusion," Laura Bosley, an F.B.I. spokeswoman, said on Friday. 
Much of the investigation has focused on the Earth Liberation Front.
On its Web site, the group calls itself an "international underground organization that uses direct action in the form of economic sabotage to stop the destruction of the natural environment." Since 1997, members in North America are believed to have caused more than $100 million in damage to real estate developers' offices, houses and construction and logging sites. Before last week, S.U.V.'s had been damaged in Seattle; Eugene, Ore.; Erie, Pa.; and Santa Cruz, Calif.
Norman Hoffman, a lawyer who represents the Clippinger dealership's owner, Ziad Alhassen, said there was no valid reason to single out the Hummer.
"They burn gas -- so what?" he said. "That's not the way to look at it. A lot of people buy these cars because they're safe. A lot of women buy them for that reason. They've got a patriotic feel to them, especially after 9/11."
Mr. Alhassen, who owns five auto dealerships and began selling Hummers only a year ago, said he was "surprised and shocked" at the vandalism. "I'm determined that violent acts, terrorist acts, will not deter me," he said in an interview.
Mr. Alhassen -- whose lawyer said his losses in the fire were covered by insurance -- was back in business almost immediately. The day after the fire, he said, his first two sales were Hummers.
Last Sunday, 22 Hummers, driven by members of the Southern California Hummer Owners' Group, showed up at his dealership to show their opposition to the vandalism.
"They were trying to scare people into not buying them, but it was criminal, and wrong," said Steve Reisman, an insulation contractor from Woodland Hills, Calif., who founded the owners' group about a year ago. "It's one thing to pass out leaflets and to put stickers on cars saying they pollute, but it's another to start setting fire to them."

HEADLINE: North Korea Disdains More Nuclear Talks 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN with DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
North Korea declared today that it saw no purpose in continuing nuclear talks with the five nations it met in Beijing this week and was left with no choice but to strengthen its nuclear deterrent.
 Meanwhile, American officials, responding to the threats North Korea made on Thursday to conduct a nuclear test, said that if the country exploded a nuclear device, President Bush would be forced to press for an economic quarantine, a step North Korea has said would be an act of war. 
 The North Korean announcement today -- delivered first at the Beijing airport as negotiators left the country, then in a statement issued in North Korea -- sharply contradicted a Chinese announcement as the talks concluded on Friday that all sides had agreed to further talks within two months. As always, it was unclear if North Korea was bluffing, but administration officials in Washington and several Asian diplomats said there was significant danger that the crisis would intensify. 
"The United States is saying to us that it is not interested in any further talks if the North Koreans test their nuclear device, or if there is no progress during the next two months," one senior Asian official who was deeply involved in the talks said today. "Their public position is that this all went well, because the North Koreans saw how many countries are lined up against them. But there is a real fear that Kim Jong Il," the North Korean leader, "sees that the U.S. is distracted in Iraq, and thinks this is the moment to make it clear he has the bomb." 
President Bush said nothing about the North Korean crisis as he left his ranch in Crawford, Tex., to return to Washington. But he was regularly updated during his monthlong vacation, and his aides say that as soon as American negotiators return from Beijing, the White House will have to revisit strategies for intercepting North Korean ships carrying missiles and drugs and review its limited military options if North conducts a test or fires off missiles.
American intelligence agencies have seen no evidence of an imminent nuclear test, administration officials say. But the intelligence agencies have missed such signs in the past, notably failing to forecast the exchange of nuclear tests in Pakistan and India in 1998. 
North Korea has over the past several years tested conventional explosives that could be used to detonate a nuclear device and appears to have received some foreign assistance in developing that technology, intelligence officials say.
A North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman quoted by the official KCNA news agency in Pyongyang, the capital, today dismissed the negotiations in Beijing as a "trick" intended to disarm North Korea. The spokesman said such talks were no longer of use. 
"The talks have made us believe that we have no other choice but to strengthen our nuclear deterrent force as a self-defensive means," the spokesman was quoted as saying. "We are not interested at all in this kind of talks and do not have any hopes" for continuing the negotiations, he said.
The comments were echoed by an unidentified member of North Korea's negotiating team, who told reporters as he left the Chinese capital that the talks were a failure. "We're not longer interested," he said.
It was not immediately clear if the statements were meant to reflect a formal change in policy by North Korea or were an attempt to increase its leverage ahead of the next negotiations. North Korea regularly issues barbed statements and vows to inflict harsh punishments on its enemies, but it often does not deliver on its threats.
North Korea discovered in the course of the six-party talks that it had no allies willing to take its side against pressure from the United States to dismantle its nuclear program, Bush administration officials and Asian diplomats said. Analysts said North Korea might have decided that it had nothing to gain by extending the dialogue, or might simply be seeking to change the venue, the format or the negotiating partners in the next round.
The Chinese government issued a statement today saying that the issues were so complex that much more negotiation would be needed. Chinese officials made no comment on the North Korean statement today.
But some hawks within the Bush administration clearly hope that North Korea's threats on Thursday, and its rejection of talks today, may lead China to join in imposing economic penalties on the country. China is North Korea's main supplier of oil.
During the three-day talks, Kim Yong Il, North Korea's chief representative at the discussions, said his country had nuclear weapons and might stage a nuclear test if the United States did not offer it a nonaggression treaty. The United States has ruled out offering such a treaty until North Korea verifiably dismantles its nuclear program.
Even if today's statement turns out to be more posturing, it raises fresh questions about North Korea's relationship with China, its largest aid donor and trading partner and the only country that has successfully mediated its relations with the United States.
At the conclusion of the negotiations, North Korea joined the United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia in pledging to hold another round of negotiations and to refrain from taking any provocative steps to heighten the situation in the meantime. China announced the agreement amid some fanfare, and Beijing's state-controlled newspapers trumpeted the arrangement for new talks as a sign that China's efforts to bring about a diplomatic solution had borne fruit.
North Korea's quick disavowal was "a major slap in the face to China," a leading political analyst here said, noting that Beijing would have been certain to make sure North Korea supported the text of the announcement before issuing it.
Chinese foreign policy experts say that Beijing treated the talks as a test of North Korea's sincerity in seeking a peaceful solution to the nuclear problem. Beijing has been lobbying to keep the United States from pursuing more aggressive actions against North Korea while diplomatic channels remain open.
Shi Yinhong, an international affairs expert at People's University in Beijing, said it was too early to tell how China would react, especially given North Korea's long history of using "fierce language." But he said that China had economic tools to bring pressure on North Korea and might consider using them.
"If it turns out that North Korea wants to destroy the talks, then China may stop taking soft steps," he said.
At the least, North Korea's angry reaction would appear to support the contention by Bush administration officials that the talks succeeded in putting fresh pressure on North Korea, making it clear that it had no rational choice but to scrap its nuclear program.The officials said they hoped that when negotiators relayed the details of the talks to Kim Jong Il the country would reassess its strategy.

HEADLINE: Steward of a Department He Once Sought to Scrap 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
When Spencer Abraham was a senator from Michigan, he had one big idea for the Department of Energy. Abolish it.
 Today he is the secretary of energy, overseeing the department's 100,000 employees and contractors and its $22 billion budget. And he is leading the investigation, along with his Canadian counterpart, to figure out what caused the biggest power shutdown in American history on Aug. 14 and how to prevent such a failure from happening again. 
 His new role as detective thrusts Mr. Abraham to the forefront of a complicated technical issue with intense political undercurrents. 
He was considered for the cabinet as a consolation prize after he lost re-election to the Senate, and his first choice was transportation. Energy is considered one of the least desirable cabinet posts. The department's portfolio is highly diverse, its issues are mind-numbingly technical, energy-related news is almost always bad and the secretary has little regulatory authority.
"I love this job," Mr. Abraham said the other day as a small military plane flew him to Columbus, Ohio, and Detroit for meetings on the blackout. "But when something goes wrong, it's always my fault. If the price of gas goes over $1.50, it's my fault. But the second it goes down, it was somehow 'the markets' that brought it down."
Until the blackout, Mr. Abraham had been one of the less visible members of President Bush's cabinet. Even that day, he was in London.
But as the power failure cascaded across the Midwest, Northeast and Canada, Mr. Abraham issued emergency orders to activate the Cross Sound cable connecting Long Island and Connecticut to protect the system when power returned. He caught the first plane back to Washington in the morning, visited with Northeast governors in Albany and made the rounds of the television talk shows.
Mr. Abraham, 51, is the first to admit that he is no Enrico Fermi.
Outside his office is a picture of Fermi, the Nobel physicist, standing in front of a blackboard showing off a complicated equation. Mr. Abraham laughed during a recent interview as he described a fantasy: having his own picture taken in a lab coat in front of a blackboard showing off something simpler, like 7 + 11 = 18, then hanging this picture next to that of Fermi, with the slogan "The Department of Energy: The tradition lives on."
Such self-deprecation has earned this Harvard-trained lawyer a reputation for collegiality, both inside the administration and out. Condoleezza Rice, President Bush's national security adviser, said that Mr. Abraham was "a very quick study" and that his people skills had made him "one of the primary channels for getting some improvement in our relations with the Russians" on nonproliferationissues.
Talking nukes with the Russians is just one piece of the sprawling energy empire. Mr. Abraham is also responsible for maintaining the nuclear stockpile, cleaning up billions of dollars worth of nuclear waste and developing the nuclear waste site at Yucca Mountain, Nev., which he said was his biggest challenge so far. "Yucca was bigger than the Manhattan Project," he said.
But pinpointing the cause of the blackout and preventing another are now his priorities -- and could cost $50 billion over 30 years.
A national discussion of the subject will begin this Wednesday, when Mr. Abraham is to testify before Congress. Already, some Democrats are challenging his department's authority to conduct the investigation and are calling for independent reviews.
Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, former chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said he was "apprehensive that the administration was taking over the whole investigation." He said the public had been "burned" by the administration over the secret development of its energy policy, which "raised questions about their trustworthiness."
"Once burned, twice alert," said Mr. Dingell, a Democrat.
Like most Michigan officials, Mr. Abraham is intertwined with the automotive industry. The son of an auto worker and the owner of two Chrysler minivans, he was the No. 1 recipient of campaign contributions from the automotive industry in 2000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. But even Democrats who may find Mr. Abraham too cozy with industry also find him smart and easy to work with.
"We've had a good relationship with him," said Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, the ranking Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
Senator Bingaman said the fact that Mr. Abraham represented industry was little cause for alarm in an administration that tilts that way on its own. 
"It's not as though Secretary Abraham is causing the administration to take positions they wouldn't otherwise be taking," Mr. Bingaman said. "None of them want anything significant to be done about fuel efficiency."
That pro-industry approach, set at the top and carried out agreeably by Mr. Abraham, has led to criticism that the administration has not put in effect a coherent energy policy, despite controlling both houses of Congress.
"We have an electric supply grid and an oil supply system that is more insecure and more unreliable today than it was two and a half years ago," said Arjun Makhijani, president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, a watchdog group.
Contrary to the administration's goals, he said, oil imports keep going up, as does the price of natural gas. He also faulted the administration for continuing to promote nuclear power, despite the numerous obstacles, especially financing, and for giving only lip service to renewable forms of energy.
Mr. Abraham said the administration's energy bill, which would promote new energy supplies, would address many of these concerns and also help prevent future blackouts, although it was written long before the Aug. 14 failure.
While he is obviously preoccupied by the blackout, he shows more excitement over the possibilities of transforming the nation from what he calls a carbon economy to a hydrogen economy.
"Instead of incremental improvements in renewable ideas or existing fossil projects, what we're trying to do is to take a really significant, game-changing leap forward and introduce hydrogen and fusion as major sources of 21st-century energy production," he said.
Mr. Abraham comes to these subjects with the enthusiasm of a convert, having stayed away from Bunsen burners in his youth and majored in college in political science.
At age 30, he became chairman of the Michigan Republican Party Committee, then served as deputy chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle before being elected to the Senate in 1993.
He proved a reliable conservative vote, advocating tax cuts and opposing abortion. He also used his brief Senate career to champion a cause that put him at odds with many in his party.
The grandson of Lebanese immigrants, he supported immigration at a time when his colleagues were cracking down on illegal immigrants and trying to reduce the number of legal immigrants. He staved off those proposed restrictions, then led the movement to raise the number of entry visas for high-tech foreign workers.
Mr. Abraham lost his Senate seat in 2000 to Debbie Stabenow, by one percentage point. She had portrayed him as the captive of big business, saying, "My opponent calls himself the workhorse; the question is, who is he working for?"
After he lost, Mr. Abraham seemed like an obvious choice for secretary of transportation. But according to a Congressional aide who watched the process unfold, he was caught in a political web.
Because of the closeness of the 2000 presidential election, the Bush administration wanted a Democrat in the cabinet and had its eye on a former senator, J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, for energy secretary. But Mr. Johnston said no.
The administration turned to another Democrat, Norman Y. Mineta, who had been President Bill Clinton's secretary of commerce. But Mr. Mineta, who had been chairman of the transportation committee while in the House, wanted transportation, and as a Democrat, he had more leverage than Mr. Abraham had. That left energy for Mr. Abraham.
"Spence got the booby prize," the aide said.
The awkward thing was that Mr. Abraham had supported legislation to dismantle the department, saying it had too many ill-fitting parts and "no core mission."
But by the time of his confirmation hearings in January 2001, he had a change of heart.
"I can assure the committee," he said then, "that I no longer support this legislation and its various components."
He remains slightly sheepish about his earlier stance but says he has imposed some order on the department. "We have a clearer mission today," he said, "and the department is now a much more effective place to do business."

HEADLINE: Europeans Warn Iran on Nuclear Inspections 

BYLINE:  By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
Javier Solana, the foreign policy chief for the European Union, today pressed Iran to sign a protocol that would allow more aggressive inspections of its nuclear sites. 
 "We will have bad news for Iran if it refuses to sign the additional protocol," said Mr. Solana, who came to Iran to meet with officials here, during a news conference with the Iranian foreign minister, Kamal Kharazi. 
 "Let me say this openly: no one should expect a reward for signing it," he added. "The issue is not for bargaining; it is a matter of a friend advising another friend, and Iranian authorities are politically mature to hear a friend's advice." 
Iran has come under mounting pressure to sign the protocol to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
The United States has repeatedly accused Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons. The European Union warned last month that it would review its economic ties with Iran if it refused to sign the protocol.
Iran took a step toward signing the protocol this week after a report disclosed that the International Atomic Energy Agency's inspectors had found traces of highly enriched uranium in environmental samples taken at the country's Natanz facility. Iran announced its willingness in a letter to the agency to begin negotiations on the issue.
Mr. Kharazi said today that Iran's good will was evident in its willingness to let the agency's inspectors take samples from its nuclear facilities and in its talks on the protocol. 
Iran, which has always maintained that its nuclear power program is for peaceful purposes, has so far refused to sign the protocol, and demands technical cooperation in nuclear science from other signing nations in return. It also wants a guarantee that inspectors will not be given complete freedom to move inside the country to gain access to and expose military secrets. 
In response to the report about enriched uranium, Iran said the equipment had been imported and had arrived with the traces of the substance. 
The International Atomic Energy Agency will meet on Sept. 8 to review the protocol issue and could send the case to the United Nations Security Council if the agency concludes that Iran's nuclear activities pose a threat.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN; 
Worried Democrats See Daunting '04 Hurdles

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WALPOLE, N.H., Aug. 30 

 BODY:
The race for the Democratic presidential nomination shifts into a more intense phase this Labor Day weekend, with some party leaders worried about the strength of their field of candidates and fearful of what they view as President Bush's huge advantage going into next year's election.
 Many prominent Democrats said that Mr. Bush might be vulnerable, given problems with the economy, and continued American fatalities in Iraq. But they said he could be unseated only by an aggressive, partisan challenge that built on Democratic anger lingering from the 2000 election, and by a nominee who somehow managed to survive a complicated nominating fight that was pulling their party to the left. 
 "It's going to be tough," said Walter F. Mondale, the former vice president who lost his challenge to Ronald Reagan in 1984. "You're trying to beat an incumbent who has all this money, and who has got the field all to himself, while all this infighting is going on in the Democratic Party." 
Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said: "It's going to be very, very difficult to defeat Bush next year. He will have more money than any candidate in history." 
Even at a packed rally for Howard Dean this morning on a farm in this community just across the border from Vermont, some Democrats were expressing concern that none of their candidates appeared to have what it would take to defeat Mr. Bush, with many mixing strong praise for Dr. Dean with skepticism about his ability to defeat Mr. Bush.
"I think it is a weak field," said John Meyer, 41, an architect from Henniker, who said he was waiting to see if Gen. Wesley K. Clark would enter the race. "A lot of them are lackluster candidates."
Against this daunting general election backdrop, the nominating contest is as unsettled as any Democratic presidential competition in 20 years, with candidates who have struggled for months to win attention from a nation that seems to have things on its mind other than an election that is 15 months away.
For now, Dr. Dean is widely viewed by Democrats as the leading contender, followed by Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. 
Their two-way contest within a contest follows a remarkable surge this summer by Dr. Dean, a physician and former Vermont governor who was once viewed as little more than a one-issue maverick. It also speaks of a shortfall in Mr. Kerry's strategy of clearing the field by presenting himself as the inevitable choice of his party.
But many Democrats express reservations about both these New Englanders, and that is reflected in the failure of either to draw the institutional party support that typically rallies around a perceived winner. Some Democrats worry that Dr. Dean would prove an easy mark for Mr. Bush, given his liberal views and his lack of any experience in foreign affairs; others warn that Mr. Kerry is an awkward public figure who has run a timorous campaign.
At least three other Democratic candidates -- Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Senator John Edwards of North Carolina -- have turned their attention to what has become a fight for third place. Their calculation is that Mr. Kerry or Dr. Dean will founder in the opening Democratic contests.
"I think it's a three-person race: It's us, Dean and Kerry," said Steve Elmendorf, a senior adviser to Mr. Gephardt, in a formulation that was echoed with only slight variations by advisers to Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Edwards. 
The remaining candidates are Senator Bob Graham of Florida, who has yet to show signs of strong support; the Rev. Al Sharpton of New York; Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio; and Carol Moseley Braun, the former senator from Illinois. 
Associates of General Clark have said he has told them that he will probably join the race. But aides to most of the other candidates say he is too late to have a good shot, and they view him more as competing for a second spot on the ticket.
The candidates are girding for an unusually frantic nomination schedule that starts with the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 19, and could effectively be over by March 2, if not sooner, when 11 states hold contests. Some candidates see opportunity in this confusion: Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Edwards have made the risky decision to endure losses in Iowa and New Hampshire -- states where they are weak and that normally help winnow the field -- and hold on for later primaries in states more hospitable to them.
Though the Labor Day weekend is a traditional demarcation point in American campaigns, the Democrats have spent much of the past eight months making policy speeches, raising money, nailing down supporters and traveling to states like Iowa, South Carolina, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma and, of course, here in New Hampshire. But they are now preparing to move into a significantly more intense and higher profile part of the race.
The first of six officially sanctioned Democratic debates takes place on Thursday in Albuquerque. Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Kerry are going on the air with television advertisements in Iowa and in New Hampshire this week, their aides said today, following Mr. Edwards and Dr. Dean.
And in the coming weeks, the last two major Democratic candidates will go through the formality of announcing their candidacies. Mr. Kerry is to make his announcement on Tuesday in South Carolina while Mr. Edwards has scheduled his for Sept. 16 in North Carolina. Mr. Edwards, who was struggling with choosing between running for a second term in the Senate or proceeding with a presidential campaign that so far has not taken off, is almost certain to bow out of the Senate race and run for the White House, his aides said. After the 2000 election, Mr. Edwards was viewed by many Democrats as one of the most exciting new faces in the field, but he has been eclipsed by Dr. Dean and Mr. Kerry.
The fluidity of the contest was underscored this week with a poll in New Hampshire that showed Dr. Dean pulling ahead of Mr. Kerry in a state that Mr. Kerry had all but taken for granted. The results, several Democrats said, were at least partly driven by the fact that Dr. Dean alone has been advertising heavily in New Hampshire over the past month and has been riding a positive wave of national publicity, including cover stories in Time and Newsweek.
Still, it had the effect of gutting Mr. Kerry's pretense of inevitability while thrusting Dr. Dean in the role that Mr. Kerry held last summer: the man most Democrats view as the candidate to beat. 
Aides to Dr. Dean's rivals said there was no shortage of issues with which to try to discredit Dr. Dean. They pointed to what they said would be his poor chance of beating Mr. Bush, given his lack of foreign policy experience; stands that could hurt him in Democratic primaries, like his opposition to gun control; and shifts in positions on major issues that his opponents said would undercut his effort to present himself as the straight-talking outsider.
But the unorthodox character of Dr. Dean's candidacy -- and the nature of his support from men and women who have been drawn into politics for the first time by his candidacy -- has turned Dr. Dean into a difficult target for conventional political attacks.
Aides to his rivals said they had drawn a lesson from Dr. Dean's unsteady appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" in June, which was mocked as near disastrous among party leaders but now appears to have served to rally his base around him. Several said they feared that Dr. Dean would be strengthened by conventional political attacks. As a result, Dr. Dean's rivals are all stepping gingerly, waiting for someone else to risk the first shot.
"No one wants to be the person to take on Dean," said Ron Klain, a Democratic consultant who was a senior adviser to Al Gore in 2000.
Dr. Dean's success poses a particularly big problem for Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Kerry's advisers planned to spend much of the weekend debating how to handle him in the weeks ahead. Many Democrats say it is hard to see how Mr. Kerry could survive losing to Dr. Dean in New Hampshire.
"There's at least a 90 percent likelihood right now that either Dean or Kerry will be the nominee," said Mr. Kerry's campaign manager, Jim Jordan. "And the race is as even as it can be. His advantages are purely stylistic. Kerry's are substantive and experiential."
Dr. Dean's success poses a problem for Mr. Gephardt as well, underlining what have been the central problems for the candidate that some White House officials once viewed as the probable winner of the nominating contest: Mr. Gephardt is a familiar character at a time when his party is looking for new faces, and he helped Mr. Bush devise the resolution that led to the invasion of Iraq.
"Gephardt has a tired Democratic message," Jane Byle, a retired school librarian, said the other day, after turning out to see Mr. Edwards in Waterloo, Iowa. "We need a more current message."
Mr. Gephardt's advisers say he would almost certainly fold his second bid for the White House if he lost Iowa, his neighboring state, which he won when he ran for president in 1988. And many Democrats in Iowa say Dr. Dean would probably defeat Mr. Gephardt if the vote was today.
What is increasingly clear, several Democrats said, is that primary voters are not likely to choose someone who is promising to run a nuanced campaign against Mr. Bush. Dr. Dean has set the tone on that, as he made clear again today.
"John Ashcroft is not a patriot," he said, referring to the attorney general's advocacy of the Patriot Act. "John Ashcroft is a descendant of Joseph McCarthy."
Harsh or not, Dr. Dean's attacks on Mr. Bush have heartened Democratic audience, and the pitch of attacks on Mr. Bush by other Democrats has increased with each new sign of Dr. Dean's success.
"My impression is that Dean has been very good for Kerry -- but I'm sure Kerry doesn't feel that way," Mr. Mondale said. "Kerry got into the race and he was very correct and almost cautious, feeling his way, and not coming across very strongly. In the last two or three weeks, you've seen a new kind of Kerry developing. I suspect that Dean's challenge had something to do with that."
In Iowa, Gov. Tom Vilsack said in an interview that Democrats in his state were feeling better about the political landscape next year.
"Democrats in Iowa and across the country recognize that this is a vulnerable president," Mr. Vilsack said. "The president is going to have to defend his policies. He isn't going to be able to get by with platitudes like compassionate conservatism."
One prominent Democrat said that while Mr. Bush was "eminently beatable," the Democratic nominating process seemed nowhere near producing someone who could do the job. "The trouble in 2004 is not that Bush is going to be strong, but rather than we are going to be weak," this official said.
