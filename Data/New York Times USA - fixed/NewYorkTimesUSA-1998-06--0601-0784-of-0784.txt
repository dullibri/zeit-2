HEADLINE: On Camera Again, After 7 Years;
Documentary's Subjects Now Speak Out as Teen-Agers

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
Lucy, voluble as always, is at boarding school these days; the pressure to become a Princetonian seems irresistible. Alexis is pretty serious about becoming a marine biologist. And Luis, no longer homeless but charismatic as ever, has left the Latin Kings gang in Milwaukee but will soon star as a gang member onstage in a Victory Memorial Church production.
They are seven years older now, and they're back. That demographically correct band who became America's darlings in 1991 has returned in a second installment of the documentary series that is following the lives of 16 children from age 7 through adulthood. It will be broadcast for 90 minutes as "14 Up in America" on Sunday night on Showtime. 
"This series has no beginning, middle or end," said Phil Joanou, the director. "I like that the project lacks inherent dramatic structure. It's just life. The drama is in how all these lives will turn out."
The American series is based, of course, on the groundbreaking British documentary that has tracked 14 English children for the last 35 years as they have segued through school, college, jobs, marriage, children, success, failure, euphoria and agita.
It is "a unique longitudinal, psychological and social history that defies broad definition," said the executive producer of the series, Michael Apted, the English filmmaker who, in 1964, produced the first of the highly praised "7 Up" documentaries.
The documentaries have proliferated across the globe: after the American version was filmed in 1990, Mr. Apted set loose a Russian documentary crew that filmed 7-year-olds in Russia. That team has just completed its own version of "14 Up." Subsequently, versions of "7 Up" were started in South Africa, Japan and Germany.
Mr. Apted, gray-haired, tweedy and avuncular at 57, first filmed his group of English youngsters when they were 7 and he was 22, then visited them again when they were 14, 21, 28 and 35. The newest installment, "42 Up," will be broadcast on the BBC next month.
The series is "a mix of instant history, sociology and soap opera," Mr. Apted said. "It's either a great Victorian novel, or a fascinating invasion of people's privacy. It depends on how you look at it." The American version is following the master script. Mr. Joanou interviewed more than 20 7-year-old boys and girls from disparate ethnic, racial, economic and social backgrounds in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Lincoln, Neb., and Dublin, Ga.
Six of the children had well-off parents; six were poor, including one, Luis, from a homeless family; the rest had middle-class backgrounds. The group includes children who are Asian, black, Hispanic and white.
In "7 Up," three Manhattan second graders, Lucy, Alexis and Kate, were filmed in the elite precincts of the Nightingale-Bamford School in Manhattan. They wore pressed uniforms and crisp white blouses.
Now, Lucy and Alexis -- who, like the other subjects of "14 Up," are identified only by first names in the documentary and who spoke on the condition that their last names not be published -- were being casual at Sofia, a Madison Avenue pizza hangout in the independent-school zone on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
They have become minor celebrities not only in their schools but also as far away as Paris, "where someone came up to me and said, 'I've seen you on TV,' " Lucy said.
Kate, who couldn't get to Sofia but was interviewed later, said, "A baby sitter I hadn't seen in years called me when she saw it."
Alexis said, "When the film comes out, it's sort of a home video, but it's played for the whole world."
Lucy shook her head and said: "I see what a spoiled brat I was at age 7. I kept babbling on, and wouldn't let anyone speak."
 
Changing Schools, Changing Lives
The girls lost touch with one another as they changed schools through the years. "When I entered the interview room, it was weird to see Lucy and Alexis again," said Kate, 15. "At first I was expecting them to be 7."
In the fourth grade Alexis transferred to the Chapin School in Manhattan, which she termed "intensely competitive." Lucy and her parents moved to Long Island, and in the 10th grade she began attending Lawrenceville, the New Jersey boarding school, where she skipped a grade. "Lawrenceville is totally pro-Princeton, so of course I want to go there," she said.
Kate's parents divorced a year ago, and she, her mother and two sisters have moved to Westchester County. Currently Kate, who volunteered in a Manhattan women's shelter when she was 7, is interested in being a social worker.
For Luis, "right now the church is my life," he said. He was originally filmed in Manhattan in Public School 97 on East Houston Street, when he was attending school there while his family lived in a shelter on the Lower East Side. At 7 he had huge, canny eyes and streetwise indomitability; these days he is a rangy ninth grader, a running back on his Milwaukee high school football team, the South Division Cardinals.
His current ambition "is to be the pastor of a church," said Luis, who prefers being called Tony these days. He said of the documentary series: "It's nice to feel like a movie star for a while. When you're in the ghetto, you're not paid too much attention, and when they did this video, it said they actually cared."
Mr. Apted said the original, British "7 Up" in 1964 "was an accident, a one-shot." Its immense popularity gave him "the idea to go back at seven-year intervals," said Mr. Apted, who has directed feature films ranging from "Coal Miner's Daughter" (1980), with Sissy Spacek, and "Gorillas in the Mist" (1988), with Sigourney Weaver, to "Nell" (1994), with Jodie Foster, and "Extreme Measures" (1996), with Gene Hackman.
The film that recommended Mr. Joanou to Mr. Apted was the documentary "U2: Rattle and Hum" (1988). Mr. Joanou (whose name is pronounced joe-ON-oh) was the director of "State of Grace" (1990), with Sean Penn; "Final Analysis" (1992), with Richard Gere, and "Heaven's Prisoners" (1996), with Alec Baldwin.
The American series is ultimately intended for theatrical release in 2012, when its subjects are 28, following the pattern of the English series. Until then, , an installment is to appear every seven years as a television special.
"I am struck with how savvy and worldly-wise the American 14-year-olds are," Mr. Apted said. "My English children were a bit more innocent."
The original English series has focused on the disparities of the English class system, as played out in the children's lives. Mr. Joanou said his subjects "are not as class-bound as the English, or at least not as aware of class boundaries."
He added: "They see themselves as equal. In our country there are strong economic boundaries to opportunity, but the kids don't see them. That's positive for them, but it's also disturbing for the culture."
To a reporter who interviewed the "Up" youngsters when they were 7, it is clear that their lives have been transformed by fate and the meander of time. But their personalities seem fixed -- blurred pictures that are slowly developing before the camera.
"Their lives are unpredictable, but I'm inclined to think that their core personality doesn't change," Mr. Apted said.
To Mr. Joanou, "it is the most important project in my life," he said. "There is nothing else like it for a documentarian."
"It's impossible not to reflect on where you were seven years ago,"he said. "Then, the kids were waist high, and now they're taller than me. I'm 36. Now I have gray hairs, and a little less on top."
 
Seeing Growth As a Painful Process
For Mr. Apted, the project is equally consuming. "Without being nauseating about it, they are very much like a family," he said, "and our lives are interwoven whether we like it or not."
The "14 Up" bunch has found growth to be a painful process. "At 7 I thought I knew everything, I was so confident of what I had to say," Lucy said. "Now I'm not so sure if I'm right. I guess now we're facing the world."
Alexis said she was "more aware of being better off and the advantages it gives you," adding: "But you can have a whole lot of money and just slack off. It may sound retarded to say this, but I believe we all have the same chance of succeeding."
They are quite aware of the documentary process, and at times are annoyed by it. "I feel I was stereotyped as some kind of Upper East Side rich snob," Kate said.
She added: "I don't think that the five minutes they give you tells anything. It's not a portrayal of the real me. And I don't know what you can learn about a whole generation from 17 kids. I had mixed feelings about being in the film again. But they said that everyone else is doing it, so I felt pressured to do it."
The group "is supposed to represent our generation," Lucy agreed, "but we're so much more than what you see on screen. And of course they have to ask us questions like 'Are you having sex?' I mean, puh-lease! The interview went on so long I began giggling and couldn't stop."
Luis said he "took the questions like a test" in the film interview, and "I answered them with truth; I don't know if I passed."
 
Looking Ahead To the 21 Mark
The American teen-agers say they intend to participate in the next round, at age 21. "It's risky," Lucy said.
Alexis interrupted: "But it's a cool risk. At least people will know that you were alive. We'll leave something behind."
Lucy smiled. "I feel we're part of an experiment," she said, "but I think we're taking over the experiment. I'm already making plans to be hyper and outgoing at 21, versus depressed and solemn at 14."
Deadpan, Alexis said: "Absolutely. I'm working on my wardrobe for age 21."
It is hard not to come to the aid of some of the children who are struggling, Mr. Joanou said. "We feel protective of them, but we can't help them," he said. "We have to remain objective, and show the truth that we see. We have to let their lives unfold."
As the years go by, Mr. Joanou said, "sadly, it's not impossible that there will be tragedy." He added, "Life throws a lot of curveballs, and no one gets out alive."
What is the destiny of his subjects? "It's a cliffhanger," he said. "Stay tuned for 2005."

HEADLINE: Chinese Spurn Appeal To Allow Opera Tour

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, June 23

 BODY:
After a day of last-minute efforts to negotiate a compromise that would permit a local opera company to travel to New York City to perform a classic Chinese opera, "The Peony Pavilion," as a centerpiece of the Lincoln Center Festival next month, cultural officials here continued to block the project. The director of the Shanghai Bureau of Culture insisted that the modern staging of the work was inappropriate for foreign viewers and would not be permitted to travel.
Coming days before the arrival of President Clinton, who is scheduled to land in China on Thursday evening, the artistic controversy threatens to sour an otherwise optimistic atmosphere that has been carefully planned by Chinese and American officials for the visit, which includes three days in Shanghai beginning on Monday. 
 Nigel Redden, director of the Lincoln Center Festival, flew to Shanghai on Monday to try to reach a compromise with Shanghai officials so the opera would not have to be abandoned. Although the contract between Lincoln Center and the Kunqu Opera Company does not technically involve the Bureau of Culture, its officials have exercised unwritten authority to step in and make decisions.
After an inconclusive meeting today, the director of the Bureau of Culture, Ma Bomin, reissued a statement made last week declaring that extensive revisions of the opera's script were still necessary before it could be approved. It also accused the director hired by Lincoln Center, Chen Shi-Zheng, of introducing "feudal," "ignorant" and "pornographic" elements into the opera.
Mr. Redden was more conciliatory, apparently hoping for a last-minute breakthrough even as that possibility seemed increasingly unlikely.
"I still hope that we can somehow break the logjam, but I do not have anything positive to report," Mr. Redden said.
The six-part production is scheduled to begin on July 7, with nightly performances through July 12. The six parts are then to be compressed into a weekend marathon, scheduled to begin on July 17.
The opera company's containers packed with six tons of elaborate sets, props and costumes are still stranded at Shanghai International Airport, where a cargo flight scheduled for last week was unexpectedly blocked.
 At Lincoln Center, Janice Price, the vice president for marketing and communications, said that "Thursday is our drop-dead date" for departure of the cargo if the production was to open as planned on July 7. The opening night is already sold out, she added.
 But she said it was possible that the production could begin later and be extended past the scheduled close of the festival, on July 26. A complicating factor, she said, is that the six-day presentation must precede the three-day marathon and adequate rehearsal time is needed between the two.
One of the most stunning aspects of the fracas is that plans to perform a 400-year-old Chinese opera in the United States reflect the innocuous, nonpolitical sort of cultural exchange that China's Government is trying hard to promote. Showcasing elements of China's endlessly complex culture is something its leaders generally prefer to talk of human rights or nuclear proliferation.
Yet the standoff over "The Peony Pavilion" is a reminder of the considerable political power still wielded by a small band of ultraconservative officials in this nation despite all the liberating social and economic changes under way here. Many of these officials control cultural and media affairs in the ministries.
Rather than promoters of artistic performances, cultural officials often view themselves as the last guardians of Communist Party ideology, outdated and unpopular as it is with most Chinese.
Last week Ms. Ma objected to elements of the unorthodox staging of the opera introduced by Mr. Chen. It was not political content that offended Ms. Ma but rather the innovative way that he approached the opera, a 55-scene extravagaza that he wanted to stage in its 20-hour entirety.
Mr. Chen insists that his interpretation of the opera , recreates the original spirit of the work written by Tang Xianzu in 1598 and lost over the years as the genre deteriorated, becoming so stilted and lifeless that relatively few Chinese viewers could enjoy it.
His staging appeared to be a singular success, with the audience at a dress rehearsal in Shanghai this month responding with laughter and raucous applause.
Even The People's Daily, the principal Communist Party newspaper, published an enthusiastic review on June 11.
"In such an open theatrical environment, the audience is struck by a richly interesting picture of life of ordinary people in the Ming Dynasty," the reviewer wrote. "This opera is intoxicating from the opening moments."
Other official comment also reflected broad approval from the authorities, before Ms. Ma stepped in.
Just a few days ago, China's Minister of Culture, Sun Jiazheng, went out of his way to cite the coming performance of "The Peony Pavilion" in New York as a prime example of cultural cooperation to be celebrated during President Clinton's visit.
But on Saturday, the day the New China News Agency reported Mr. Sun's comments in Beijing, cultural officials in Shanghai opened a personal attack on Mr. Chen, who grew up in China and moved to the United States in 1987.
In commentaries published in Shanghai's three major state-run newspapers, the cultural officials sharply criticized Mr. Chen, often in stilted and sometimes xenophobic language common to Chinese Communist Party oratory, accusing him of pandering to foreigners, aggrandizing his artistic vision and ignoring sacred traditions.
While the original opera is wildly suggestive, a scene of lovemaking between a man and a ghost occurs behind a screen, without any nudity onstage. As Mr. Chen likes to point out, the eroticism of the opera is refined by modern standards, just as it was in the works of Shakespeare, Tang's contemporary.
The differences between cultural bureaucrats like Ms. Ma and an innovative director like Mr. Chen represent a distinct clash between old and new in China.
The Bureau of Culture relies on faithful copying of well-known performance methods, and insists on a respect for or at least a passive acceptance of authority.
In contrast, young artists like Mr. Chen stress creativity, individual thinking and experimentation. It is no surprise that his interpretation of "The Peony Pavilion" appears to enjoy virtually unanimous support from actors young and old in the opera company, including its head, who has a leading role in the opera.
Ms. Ma, an experienced singer of Peking Opera before she became an official in 1986, now heads one of the most conservative branches of the Shanghai government.
Ms. Ma stresses the need for better control over cultural affairs, even though the government continues to cut financing for the arts and is even starting to ask for corporate sponsors for cultural affairs it can no longer afford to finance itself.
"People should not be surprised if artistic troupes appear, named after specific companies," Ms. Ma told Liberation Daily last month.
Even Ms. Ma's way of making her views public over the last week relied on old-fashioned party indirectness and obscurity, not that it fooled anyone. When she released a statement on Saturday criticizing Mr. Chen, she did so without signing any official's name, instead using the "Kunqu Opera Company Performance Group," as though the actors from "The Peony Pavilion" were voicing the objections.
But no actors stepped forward to claim any such view, and the fax number printed on the statement was from the Bureau of Culture.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Billion here, billion there, and soon your estimate on 1998 U.S. ad spending reaches $200.3 billion.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
REMEMBER the disk jockeys on the old Top 40 radio stations who shouted, "And the hits just keep on coming!"? Well, the rosy predictions for domestic advertising spending just keep on coming from a leading industry forecaster.
Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at the McCann-Erickson USA unit of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York, said yesterday that he would again raise his estimate of spending for 1998. The reason: myriad signs of economic growth that have been more robust than anticipated. 
 "We're in a good, strong upward movement," Mr. Coen said at a presentation of his predictions at the University Club in midtown Manhattan. "The economic climate looks even more favorable."
So "barring any unforeseen developments," he added, "things look better for 1998 than they did in December," when he issued his previous forecast.
Ad spending is closely watched because it is deemed a reliable indicator of the health of the economy. For instance, advertising as a percentage of gross domestic product peaked in 1987 and 1988 at 2.35 percent as the economy boomed, and then it fell as a recession took hold, bottoming out at 2.12 percent in 1992.
Mr. Coen predicted that marketers would spend a record $200.3 billion in the United States in 1998, up 6.8 percent from a revised figure of $187.5 billion for 1997. The 1997 figure marks a gain of 7 percent from the $175.2 billion that was spent in 1996.
If Mr. Coen's prediction holds, advertising as a percentage of G.D.P. will "match or pass" the previous peak of 2.35 percent, he said.
While stronger than expected, the growth expected for 1998 would be the smallest in percentage terms since a 5.2 percent increase in 1993. Yet, if the figure of $200.3 billion is indeed reached, it will be the first time that domestic ad spending tops the $200 billion level. Overseas ad spending first passed that figure in 1995.
Conditions for ad spending overseas will not be as favorable this year as they will be in the United States, Mr. Coen said, primarily because of the economic downturn in Asia. As a result, he has trimmed his estimate for overseas ad spending in 1998 for a second time.
Mr. Coen "has highlighted the concerns in Asia, which are warranted but manageable," said Karen Ficker, an analyst at Furman Selz in New York who follows the media and advertising industries. Ms. Ficker, who attended Mr. Coen's presentation, said: "We're encouraged by his upward revisions in the United States. Everything we see seems to support that."
Mr. Coen, who has been tracking advertising and media trends since 1948, issues his predictions twice a year, in June and December, revising them based on updated data.
Though he was once known for overly optimistic forecasts, he most recently has underestimated spending as the American economic expansion chugs along.
The estimate of $200.3 billion is the third made by Mr. Coen for American ad spending in 1998. In June 1997, he forecast a 1998 figure of $196.5 billion, which he raised six months later to $198.4 billion. Yet "the demand for media time and space" continues mostly unabated, Mr. Coen said, so he has increased his prediction once more.
Economists are projecting that unemployment and inflation in 1998 will fall from 1997 while housing starts and vehicle sales will rise, he added, and there are factors, like the Olympics and elections, that stimulate demand for ads in even-numbered years.
In raising his forecast for 1998, Mr. Coen cited the first-quarter results in several large national ad categories such as automobiles, up 17 percent from the corresponding period of 1997; toiletries and cosmetics, up 14 percent; food, up 11 percent; movies, up 9 percent, and beverages and snacks, up 8 percent.
In some secondary national ad categories, he said, the gains were even larger: insurance, up 33 percent; airlines, up 28 percent; computers, up 26 percent, and beer and wine, up 22 percent.
As a result, several national media enjoyed double-digit percentage gains in ad revenue during the first quarter of 1998, Mr. Coen said, including cable television networks, up 15.8 percent; the four biggest broadcast TV networks, up 14.9 percent, and spot radio, up 11 percent.
Of Mr. Coen's forecast of $200.3 billion, $118 billion is in national ad spending, up 7 percent from 1997, and $82.3 billion is in local ad spending, up 6.5 percent from 1997.
Among the local media registering gains in ad revenue in the first quarter of 1998, Mr. Coen mentioned spot television, up 13 percent; newspaper classifieds, up 9.8 percent; spot radio, up 9 percent; Yellow Pages, up 4.6 percent, and retail newspaper ads, up 4.4 percent.
"It looks like another pretty good year for local newspaper advertising," Mr. Coen said, because "everything we look at suggests consumers are spending a little more freely" on the types of merchandise sold through newspapers.
Turning to ad spending abroad, Mr. Coen's revised figure for 1998 is $218.4 billion, compared with a forecast he made in December of $236 billion and a forecast he made in June 1997 of $240.5 billion. Overseas ad spending last year totaled $210 billion, down 1 percent from $212.1 billion in 1996; it was the first decline internationally since 1993.
The Asian crisis "affects the overseas consolidated numbers," Mr. Coen said, offsetting strong increases in ad spending expected in such countries as Brazil, Britain and Mexico. Among the largest declines Mr. Coen predicted were those for Indonesia, down 30 percent from 1997; Malaysia, down 20 percent, and South Korea, down 10 percent.
Mr. Coen's worldwide total estimate for 1998, then, is $418.7 billion. If it pans out, it will be the first time the total exceeds $400 billion. It would mark an increase of 5.3 percent from a final figure of $397.5 billion for 1997. That spending last year represented a gain of 2.6 percent from $387.3 billion spent in 1996, the smallest annual increase since 1993.
Mr. Coen's initial worldwide forecast for 1998, made in June 1997, was $437 billion, which he lowered to $434.4 billion in December.
And making his first prognostications about 1999, Mr. Coen estimated spending in the United States at $212.3 billion, which would be up 6 percent from 1998, and spending overseas at $228.2 billion, up 4.5 percent from this year.
His worldwide total for next year, then, is $440.5 billion, an increase of 5.2 percent from 1998.
And beyond 1999?
"As we approach the year 2000," Mr. Coen said, "we think the momentum will build" and may produce something like the "upsurge we saw in 1976," when ad spending in America rose smartly because of the Bicentennial celebration.
So, ad spending at the millennium could be "hitting half a trillion dollars," Mr. Coen said.
About 50 people attended Mr. Coen's presentation, which was his 25th annual midyear update. The turnout was lower than usual because some agency executives and journalists had left to attend the 45th International Advertising Festival, which continues through Saturday in Cannes, France.
McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising is part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.

Japan Tries to Halt Selloff in Bank's Shares

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 23

 BODY:
Japan's Finance Minister tried to calm the financial markets today and avert a further selloff in the shares of a large weak bank, as the Government moved a step closer toward establishing a system to help restructure failed banks.
The nation's leaders are working out the details of what they're calling the Total Plan to tackle $600 billion in bad and doubtful loans infecting the banking system. 
 The plan has taken on a special urgency because of news reports that Long-Term Credit Bank, one of Japan's biggest financial institutions, is in trouble. The market has driven down its stock by more than 60 percent in the last couple of weeks.
Long-Term Credit is reportedly seeking a rescue merger to help stabilize its business. The bank has denied the reports, as well as accounts of merger discussions, but said today that it was working on a restructuring plan.
Japan's anemic banking system is considered an underlying cause of the malaise that has afflicted the world's second-largest economy, severely weakened the yen and stock market and played a role in the broader economic problems confronting much of Asia.
A United States delegation visited Tokyo last week to discuss Japan's predicament after both countries took the unusual step of buying yen and selling dollars to strengthen the Japanese currency. But the yen has started to weaken again, and today the stock market fell 1.7 percent.
Government leaders, one after another, expressed assurances today that Long-Term's depositors, lenders and counterparties in financial transactions would not suffer losses.
"I hope depositors and investors feel assured about their assets," Hikaru Matsunaga, the Finance Minister, said.
Long-Term Credit's stock price fell to a record low of 62 yen on Monday, from more than 200 just a couple of weeks ago. Today, it was the most heavily traded stock, closing at 71 yen, up 9 yen.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto also tried to reassure depositors and investors today that the Government would maintain financial stability. He said the Government would take "drastic measures to resolve the bad loan problem and will completely protect sound borrowers."
A high-level group of ministers and members of the dominant Liberal Democratic Party today approved an overall proposal for the Total Plan, which will be submitted to a special parliamentary session shortly after Upper House elections July 12.
The group today also endorsed the idea of establishing a "bridge bank," and will work out the details by July 2.
This bank would take over the assets and liabilities of banks facing bankruptcy and have the ability to lend money, so that the borrowers of failed banks would not be hurt.
Critics say unless the plan is properly structured, the bank could just keep expanding if the number of bankrupt banks increased.

HEADLINE: Lab Reports Of Iraq Poison Bolster Case For Sanctions

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 23

 BODY:
The first physical evidence that Iraq loaded deadly VX nerve gas into missile warheads before the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf has strengthened the resolve of the United States and its allies to maintain the embargo on Iraqi oil sales, diplomats said today.
United Nations weapons inspectors excavated warhead fragments in March from a weapons dump at Nibai, Iraq, and shipped them to a United States Army laboratory at Aberdeen, Md. The laboratory found significant traces of VX, an agent so toxic that a few drops can kill. 
 "It's a nail in the coffin for Iraq's efforts to lift sanctions and to show substantial progess on disarmament," the chief United States delegate, Bill Richardson, said today in an interview.
Britain's chief delegate, Sir John Weston, said there is no room to give Iraq the benefit of the doubt about the existence of "extremely potent chemical weapons" like VX. "I think it ill serves the United Nations not to look the facts in the face and to deal with them squarely in a case of this kind," he said.
The United States and Britain have fought against relaxing the sanctions, which were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, until weapons inspectors verify that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction and the means to make them. The condition was spelled out in Security Council Resolution 687, enacted in 1991.
The three other permanent members of the Security Council, China, France and Russia, have supported a more accommodating approach that takes into account the limited cooperation Iraq has offered so far. The oil sanctions have already been relaxed to allow Iraq to earn money for food and medicine imports.
But the discovery of VX on missile warhead fragments, first reported today by The Washington Post, has sounded alarms because it offers proof that the Iraqis lied when they called their VX program purely experimental. Experts say that if the Iraqis could stabilize VX sufficiently to pour into warheads, they could also keep it stable enough to hide for years from inspectors.
President Clinton left little doubt that the United States will use the discovery to keep the sanctions on Iraqi oil. "Let the inspections go forward and don't lift the sanctions until the resolutions are complied with," he said today.
Iraq, in a statement today by its United Nations mission, said the Aberdeen analysis of warheads could not be correct because "continuous production failure" had prevented the use of VX in any munitions.
The Iraqi statement also sought to find fault with the handling of the VX samples, saying Baghdad was told that only one of the seven samples analyzed had shown variable traces of VX. It also said that the samples were taken without giving Iraq equivalent samples, as had been agreed upon, and that no soil samples were taken for comparison.
The statement also noted that Iraq had insisted that any analysis of importance be done in a neutral country or be divided among laboratories of other countries.
The Security Council is to be briefed on the issue on Wednesday by Richard Butler, the Australian diplomat who heads the arms inspection team. In a report he sent to the Security Council last Thursday, Mr. Butler said that when he met with Iraqi officials in Baghdad on June 13 and 14, they refused to address questions about production of VX, some biological agents and missile fuel.
Mr. Butler, who arrived in New York today from Australia, refused to talk about the Aberdeen results.
Ewan Buchanan, a spokesman for the team, said, "No doubt it will be discussed in depth in the council tomorrow, which is the proper place for such discussion."
A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Butler was advised that the warhead shards had tested positive for VX before he arrived in Baghdad on June 11, and raised the matter informally with his Iraqi counterpart, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. Mr. Aziz, according to the diplomat, dismissed the finding as a lie.
Mr. Butler's report sent to the Security Council on Thursday alluded to their confrontation. "During the discussions, the commission presented the preliminary results of the chemical analysis of certain excavated remnants of special mission warheads," it said. "The Iraqi side rejected these results."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Environmental Entrepreneur Closes a Deal

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
FORTUNATELY for Tom Fox, the story of his little yellow water taxis no longer works as a perfect metaphor for his life.
By now, the boats were supposed to have been buzzing around the waterfront several times a day, moving people to various stops from the Brooklyn Bridge to the Intrepid museum, but Mr. Fox had to shut down the whole enterprise in August after only three months because the boats didn't have enough power to navigate the harbor. New York's currents proved too much for them. 
 Imagine what a halfway imaginative biographer could make of this detail if Mr. Fox were still the blue-jeaned environmentalist of his youth, hopelessly proselytizing for more green space in the city of mortar, writing position papers on the importance of community gardens. But Mr. Fox makes money these days as an environmental and development consultant, wears a tie to work (some days), and last week watched a longtime dream come true when the state and city finally agreed on how to build and operate a pulsating strip of park along the Hudson River on Manhattan's West Side.
Mr. Fox has been crusading for that park for years, including three as founding president of the Hudson River Park Conservancy, which drew up the plans for the five-mile park and worked out its fundamental compromises with the surrounding communities, deciding when the green of chlorophyll should give way to the green of economic development. The Pataki administration replaced him in 1995, preferring someone with more direct loyalty to the Governor's staff, but the plan that will now proceed is virtually unchanged from the one developed by him and his staff, and so the moment is finally sweet.
"For me, it feels like closure," he said this week in his consulting-firm offices at 42d Street and Fifth Avenue. "We're actually going to have the largest riverfront park in the United States right here in river city, and we the people made it happen."
Not all the people, of course. There are still those who oppose the park as a development grab, environmentalists once on the same side as Mr. Fox in fighting Westway and other large projects around the city, who now spit out his name in derision as a sellout. In the never-ending wars that rage between real estate interests and Manhattan's community boards, he is the necessary go-between, someone who can talk to both sides but is not trusted fully by either one.
Marcy Benstock, the implacable (but increasingly marginalized) foe of Westway and the proposed park, says Mr. Fox was never an environmentalist and calls the park twice as bad as Westway. Gene Russianoff, senior attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group, says he knows of no other advocate in the city as focused and ferocious as Mr. Fox, but fears that the "develo-park" will be slowly whittled by economic interests.
ALL of this is frustrating for Mr. Fox, who used to lob seeds into vacant lots as a leader of the Green Guerrillas and remembers with pride working to stop Mortimer Zuckerman's proposed tower at the southwest corner of Central Park. He says his colleagues have become so used to stopping things that they can no longer create and the Hudson park would never happen without developments like the Chelsea Piers to pay for its operation.
"They're naive," he said, windmilling his arms around as if to shed some of his excess energy. "In the 21st century, without all the government funding we used to have, you have to find other ways to finance and build parks. And if there's any contribution I've made, it's the idea that parks can be self-financing, so that the money generated in the park can only go to its design, construction, management and operation."
Mr. Fox, 51, grew up on Ocean Avenue in Flatbush -- only a few blocks from the rambling Victorian where he and his wife and son live now -- and he played in Prospect Park as a boy, but he never cared much about the spaciousness of nature until he volunteered for the Navy in Vietnam, serving in combat from 1966 to 1968. Seeing jungles and marine life up close transformed him, and he came home to study biology at Brooklyn College and to develop environmental programs as a ranger in the Federal Gateway National Recreation Area.
If the war didn't quite radicalize him, it made him realize the value of fighting for a cause, and he spent years fighting for community gardens and open space on various boards and commissions around the city. But he says there was always a pragmatic aspect as well. He enlisted the support of construction unions by convincing them that open space in a city generates development and economic activity, citing Frederick Law Olmsted's arguments for Central Park more than a century earlier.
Though some advocates criticize him for trying to cash in on the planned park with his water taxi plan after being removed from the conservancy, he says it was a natural way to "do well by doing good" with a service that will benefit the public and, perhaps someday, his own bottom line.
"I'm trying to be an environmental entrepreneur here," he said. "Some environmentalists just call attention to problems. I come from the group that tries to figure a way to solve those problems, and as near as I can tell, that almost always involves money."
Of which he needs $2 million for boats with a bit more power.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A 20-Year G.M. Parts Migration To Mexico

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MATAMOROS, Mexico, June 20

 BODY:
In one of General Motors' sprawling auto parts plants in a Matamoros industrial park just south of the Rio Grande, thousands of Mexican workers earn $1 to $2 an hour producing instrument panels and steering wheels for G.M. cars and trucks.
Until just a few years ago, United States workers earning close to $22 an hour at G.M.'s Delphi East factory in Flint, Mich., made the instrument panels. And those at a plant to the north in Saginaw produced the steering wheels. 
 G.M.'s shift of production from Flint and Saginaw to this border city facing Brownsville, Tex., was part of a sweeping 20-year transfer of its United States auto parts industry across the border. Since 1978, General Motors has built more than 50 parts factories in Mexico, which today employ 72,000 workers, making its parts subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Services, Mexico's largest private employer.
Other companies from the United States have, of course, also moved plants to Mexico. The Ford Motor Company has 11 parts factories in Mexico; Chrysler has none.
The transfer of production to Mexico and other countries has become a focus of the United Automobile Workers' strike against G.M., which began at a stamping plant in Flint and at the Delphi East factory. U.A.W. officials in the United States have accused General Motors of "putting America last."
In Mexico, where the strike has idled 23,000 workers at two dozen Delphi plants, managers have told workers that the union is demanding that G.M. close its Mexican plants and return its parts production to the United States, said Juan Villafuerte Morales, a union officer representing workers at Delphi's Matamoros factories. The plants have been partly idled by the strike in Flint.
"Most of our workers understand that they're doing work that used to be done in United States factories because managers explain that to them on the plant floor," Mr. Villafuerte said. "And let me tell you, the jobs are very welcome here."
General Motors says that transferring production south has enabled it to cut costs in labor-intensive assembly production, compete more effectively against Ford, Chrysler and Japanese auto makers, and keep engineering and other operations in the United States.
The financial advantages of producing parts in Mexico are substantial, and some economists say that the North American Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect in January 1994, has only increased them. Many plants have no union, and those that do are represented by the Confederation of Mexican Workers, which is controlled by Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and works with the Government to avoid strikes. The union has kept the U.A.W. at arm's length.
Thousands of Mexican workers at G.M. and other United States-owned factories live in dirt-floor shacks in slums ringing the industrial parks where they work. Yet many say that they are delighted to have their jobs, which often start at Mexico's minimum wage of $3.40 a day but can pay experienced workers several times that. A Delphi spokesman said the company would in the next 18 months help 7,000 employees buy their own homes.
"It's a good job," said a 23-year-old woman who earns $1.36 an hour painting buttons on car radios at Deltronicos de Matamoros, a Delphi plant. The woman, who asked that her name not be used during an interview at her one-room wood-frame shed in a gritty, wind-blown Matamoros squatters' settlement, said the choking smell of solvents at her work station gave her headaches. "It's difficult work," she said. "But I'm glad to have it."
G.M. opened its first factory in Mexico in 1935, assembling trucks in the capital from parts imported from the United States. After a 1962 Mexican law required foreign auto makers to increase the local content of their vehicles, G.M. built three engine and vehicle plants in the 1960's and 70's. The new plants, like similar factories built by Ford and Chrysler, assembled vehicles for the Mexican market. In the decades since, G.M. has continued to assemble vehicles in Mexico.
But in the late 70's, in response to a 1965 law encouraging foreign manufacturers to produce goods here for export tax-free, General Motors changed strategy. "G.M. began to see Mexico as a supplier for its U.S. vehicle assembly plants, and in the 1980's built an entire parts industry here," said Arnulfo Arteaga, a Mexico City professor who studies the auto industry. "Now, Delphi's Mexican plants basically turn out parts once produced in the United States."
G.M. erected its first Mexican parts plant, to assemble wiring systems, in the large border city of Juarez in 1978.
"What is now Delphi Automotive had run into unprecedented competition," said Michael J. Hissam, a spokesman at Delphi's Mexican headquarters in Juarez. "We embarked on a plan to reduce costs by focusing final assembly in Mexico while keeping our more capital-intensive engineering, tooling and prototyping activities in the U.S. Did we come to Mexico for lower labor costs? Yes. But we also found something else -- excellent Mexican management and a dedicated Mexican work force."
Nicholas Lobaccaro, an auto industry analyst with Merrill Lynch, said General Motors had no choice but to seek lower-cost labor for parts production. G.M. is not doing anything that their competitors and that independent auto suppliers aren't doing," Mr. Lobaccaro said, adding:
"There's been tremendous pressure on parts pricing. To compete in the global economy, you need labor to be paid commensurate with value added. And you can't pay $46 an hour to do wire harnesses."
Dozens of other G.M. parts plants would be built across northern Mexico in the years that followed. In Matamoros, four Delphi plants were built in an industrial park near the intersection of Ohio Street and Michigan Avenue.
One Delphi plant, Componentes Mecanicos, opened in 1980. About 10 years later, Delphi began shifting production of instrument panels to the factory from Delphi East in Flint, said Larry Mathews, a spokesman for Flint's U.A.W. Local 651, which is currently on strike.
"They just crated the equipment, hoisted it onto a tractor-trailer, and sent it away to Mexico," Mr. Mathews said. "There's hardly anybody at this plant who hasn't seen machinery moving out in a crate with an address on it that says 'Mexico.' "
In the 1970's, Mr. Mathews added, the Delphi East plant had 13,000 workers; today, it has fewer than 6,000.
A 37-year-old worker at Componentes Mecanicos who asked that his name be withheld, said in an interview outside his two-room Matamoros home that if he qualified for a weekly attendance bonus, he earned about $1.90 an hour. Newly hired workers receive $1.05 an hour, he said. His wife also works at a G.M. assembly plant in Matamoros, and by pooling salaries, the couple has managed to rise slightly above subsistence. They own a battered Ford pickup truck, and although their home has no indoor plumbing, they have equipped it with a television set and an electric fan. He coaches his three sons in a soccer league.
Next door to Componentes Mecanicos is the Deltronicos plant, built in 1979. In the mid-1980's, G.M. shifted much of its car radio production from its Delco plant in Kokomo, Ind., to Deltronicos, U.A.W. officials said. The work force at Kokomo has dropped to 4,800 from 11,000 in 1977, the union said. The Deltronicos plant employs 5,400 workers.
Across the street from Deltronicos is a Matamoros plant owned by the Trico Products Corporation of Buffalo, a unit of Tomkins P.L.C., which supplies windshield wipers to G.M. as well as Ford and Chrysler. The transfer of much of Trico's production to Mexico since 1987, which came despite entreaties from Buffalo city officials, has reduced Trico's Buffalo work force to 200 from 2,400, U.A.W. officials said.
Misaela Castro Margaro, who is 21, earned $1.05 an hour fitting vinyl blades onto wiper assemblies at the Matamoros plant until her three-month contract expired earlier this month. She said the work was hard but she missed her job.
"I loved that plant," she said.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: MONEY;
Clinton's Challenge: Time to Deal With Asian Crisis

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
For a year the Clinton Administration has tried to minimize its direct involvement in Asia's economic crisis, pulling strings at the International Monetary Fund, sending out envoys to cajole foreign leaders and avoiding the lead role Washington took when it saved Mexico from economic implosion in 1995.
But as President Clinton prepares to leave for China, the Asian crisis, in the words of one of his top aides, is becoming "worse and worse every day," and it is becoming far more difficult for the leader of the world's largest economy to deal with it at a distance. 
 For the first time there is talk inside the Administration and at the World Bank of the possibility of an Asian depression. And Mr. Clinton will end his trip in Hong Kong, once Asia's booming example of free enterprise, whose chief executive declared on Monday that a recession was "more far-reaching than we anticipated."
Market instability, which a few months ago seemed contained, now amplifies as it circles the globe. Trouble in Southeast Asia unnerves investors in Japan, the meltdown of the yen sets off a crisis of confidence in Russia and China, and those jitters rattle Central Europe and Latin America.
Plan A, a yearlong effort to devise solutions through the I.M.F. and the World Bank, where the United States is the largest and most influential member, is clearly not working. But Mr. Clinton's economic team says direct American aid to the countries in deepest trouble -- even Russia, in which the United States has the most at stake -- is out of the question. In short, there is no Plan B.
In the weeks leading up to his trip, Mr. Clinton has delved into some risky market diplomacy, offering symbolic indications of support for Russia and Japan, in the hope that investors will be calmed by Washington's commitment.
Three weeks ago, faced with an imminent devaluation of the ruble that would undercut the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Clinton backed additional international financial aid for Russia. Last Tuesday, concerned about an attack on the yen, he approved intervening in the currency markets to prop up Japan. On Friday he urged China not to worsen a risky situation by devaluing its own currency, an argument that his aides say he will repeat in Beijing.
All those are stopgaps. Their success depends on decisions in Moscow and Tokyo and Beijing that the United States has relatively little power to influence. That is worrisome for three reasons.
First there is a fear in the White House that America's yearlong insulation from the Asian crisis may be peeling away.
Mr. Clinton's aides are circumspect about raising those worries in public, for fear of inciting added troubles in the markets. But Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin's public comments make it clear that he is far more worried about the domestic effects of the Asian crisis now than he was two months ago.
"If a major crisis were to develop," he said last week at the White House, "the effects in our nation could be great."
He cited the dramatic fall in American exports, the most measurable example. Others worry that as money pours out of Asia, it is seeking safe haven in the United States, creating a market "bubble" that could collapse when global economic fortunes change and investors sell dollars and re-invest in Asia.
The second concern is more stark. If the I.M.F. is unable to contain the instability, what does Washington do next? The $12 billion United States contribution to the bailout of Mexico was an economic success. But it cannot be repeated. Congress refused to back financial aid for America's closest neighbor, and it screamed when Mr. Clinton dipped into a fund under the control of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve.
An amendment to a major budget bill in the House this week would forbid the Administration from using that fund again, a step that Mr. Rubin warned today would "constitute an unacceptable limitation on the executive branch's ability to protect critical U.S. economic interests."
The fund, he noted, was used last year to provide backup to the I.M.F. in preventing an imminent national default in South Korea.
But Mr. Rubin's aides concede that using the fund again, even if Congress enacts no limitation, would raise an uproar, just when the Administration is trying to persuade the House to approve an additional $18 billion for the I.M.F. Even if Russia needs aid, one senior official asked recently, "where would we get the money?"
That leads to the President's third challenge, convincing China this week that it has to resist temptations to devalue its currency and convincing Americans, via television, that the global economy can do them more good than harm.
China has said it will keep its currency pegged to the dollar, even though Asian devaluations have made its products less and less competitive.
"China's got to hold the fort," C. Fred Bergsten, president of the Institute for International Economics, said. "If not, if the strong center buckles, all hell breaks lose."
Mr. Clinton will have to make the case that economic engagement benefits American workers. There is already considerable suspicion that the North America Free Trade Agreement cost American jobs, even if the evidence is mixed.
In China, Mr. Clinton has to argue that Asia is America's best long-term bet, despite the latest crisis and Congressional suspicions that China is bent on stealing technology. It was a more convincing argument in better economic times.

HEADLINE: Growth of Factory-Like Hog Farms Divides Rural Areas of the Midwest

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: LENNOX, S.D.

 BODY:
Clouds the color of gunmetal billowed across the South Dakota sky as Merlyn Steever slouched in a metal chair in a now-empty barn, his arms folded in weary resignation.
"I give up," Mr. Steever, a 50-year-old farmer, said as he waited for the trucks to load the last of his pigs and take them to slaughter, ending his career as a hog producer. "I just can't compete with the big corporates. I don't see how any farmer can." 
 The rapid growth of big hog factories, which are more akin to the corporate efficiency of General Motors than the bibbed-overall ethos of American Gothic, has emerged as perhaps the most contentious issue in the nation's farm country.
While some big-scale corporate hog farming has existed for years, it is now starting to dominate this sector of agriculture, with companies increasingly owning the hog plants, the slaughterhouses and the distribution centers.
The desperation of smaller farmers, along with anger among townspeople in rural areas offended by the foul smell of the huge hog barns, has stirred debate in a dozen states that are now considering plans to curb such plants, which can threaten underground water supplies. A ballot initiative in South Dakota, to be voted on in November, would effectively outlaw corporate livestock production. And Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma recently signed a bill restricting big hog operations.
On the Federal level, the Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to work with the states to impose strict pollution-discharge permits on all large farms by 2005. The agency said in March that it would propose regulations that could range from the installation of equipment to capture methane fumes to changing the composition of animal feed to control certain nutrients in the waste.
"It's nasty," said Barbara Dunham, 37, whose house, about a half mile from a big hog plant in central Illinois, saw its assessed property value drop 30 percent recently because of the smell. "It gets so bad you can't go outside. And you have to scrub down your inside walls."
Defenders of the big hog plants, where thousands of hogs are confined in small pens, say the producers can scarcely be blamed for delivering the kind of lean, low-cost pork that American consumers demand. The hog companies say they take every precaution to insure health and safety. And they say they contribute mightily to state tax coffers and rural regions that are starving for jobs.
"This issue has divided communities and turned neighbor against neighbor," said John Bixler, a spokesman for Dakota Rural Action, an advocacy group for small farmers in South Dakota.
Premium Standard Farms, which is owned by the Continental Grain Company and is the nation's third largest pork producer, pays about $200 million in income to about 3,000 workers in Missouri, according to a study by the University of Missouri.
Randy Mahoney, a 31-year-old supervisor for the hog company, said that when he was a teen-ager in the early 1980's, he watched the pain on his father's face when the family farm was foreclosed.
"It's a story you could hear from a lot of people around here," said Mr. Mahoney, who makes nearly $40,000 a year and never has to worry about prices on the hog markets. "I never dreamed I could stay close to home, continue doing the kind of work I'm doing and make a good living."
Before leaving work, Mr. Mahoney must shower and change clothes. Pig manure, he concedes, stinks.
That is the smell of money, say the hog plants' defenders, echoing a refrain that has been used for generations to defend steel mills, oil refineries and rubber incinerators.
To people whose image of raising pigs evokes Old McDonald's farm, the sight of big confinement operations would conjure something more from George Orwell. For example, every steel building at a Premium Standard plant near Harris, Mo., houses 1,150 hogs -- 48 pens 20 feet long and 9 feet wide, each holding about 25 pigs. The pigs are genetically designed to produce an identical cut of meat. They are inseminated artificially, and their hooves never leave concrete.
Many of the independent farmers also use this confinement method, reducing labor and saving space. The bottoms of the pens are slatted, so that waste drops and collects in a lagoon. The water, which is full of hog waste, is then spread over cropland as fertilizer.
Craig Hoogestraat, who farms his family's century-old hog operation near Lennox, a city of about 1,700 people in southeastern South Dakota, moves through the hog pens to check on the newborn piglets suckling sows in the small pens.
Mr. Hoogestraat, a former teacher who said he returned to farming after realizing that pigs were better behaved than junior high school students, leaves an oldies rock music station playing on a radio in the hog pen. Asked why he selected a music station for the pigs, he deadpanned: "Because they get upset if they hear the broadcasts of the hog reports."
Despite his upbeat ways, Mr. Hoogestraat worried aloud that if hog prices reached much lower than $35 per hundredweight -- the cost per 100 pounds of a live hog -- he did not know how he could stay in business.
His father, Donald, a former president of the South Dakota Pork Producers Council, stood by and shook his head with worry. The elder Mr. Hoogestraat, who has been a prime mover behind the anti-corporate measure, said the growth of big agricultural operations simply mirrored the trend of behemoths in every sector of the economy.
"You look at the Chrysler merger," he said. "You see Citibank and Travelers getting together. What's going to happen when all this money is concentrated in so few hands? "
Smaller farmers say they cannot produce goods at the same prices as the bigger outfits, which have deep pockets and the efficiency of scale.
But in the hog business, the competitive differences between independent farmers and big companies run even deeper. Many of the bigger hog companies now breed the animals, own the slaughterhouses and market the meat.
This control of the process allows the big companies to withstand lower hog prices, because they can make it up on the retail end. For the independent farmers, a drop in producer prices can spell doom. And lately, that is what has been happening.
Prices per hundredweight of live hogs have been in the $33-to-$45 range this year, the lowest prices in the last quarter-century, and a disaster for many pig farmers.
Economists have a mixed view about the power of laws intended to stop corporate farming. Nebraska has perhaps the nation's toughest law of that kind, forbidding any corporation to engage in farming. The measure has endured Federal court challenges. And it has, indeed, kept out corporate farmers. The South Dakota measure was drawn up along similar lines, exempting family-owned corporations. But huge family-owned operations can cause as many environmental problems as the corporate concerns.
As in the rest of agriculture, the trend toward bigger operations is unmistakable. The average swine farm today produces 432 hogs. Twenty years ago, the average farm produced 87.5 hogs.
Perhaps most significant, meatpackers get about 30 percent of their hogs from their own hog-breeding operations or from large-scale contracts with farms. That compares with 2 percent in 1970. When slaughterhouses and breeders have such close arrangements -- or, in fact, are the same company -- the market shrinks for independent farmers.
Bernie Hunhoff, a Democratic State Senator in South Dakota who is running for governor against the Republican incumbent, William J. Janklow, contends that this trend is reducing competition and creating monopolies for big companies.
"When you cut off access to markets, that's not free enterprise," said Mr. Hunhoff, who grew up on a hog farm near Yankton and supports the anti-corporate farming measure. "We're at a crossroads here. Are we going to defend and protect family farms? Or are we going to let everything to the control of the corporates?"
Mr. Janklow has opposed the ballot initiative and defends the big hog farms as good corporate citizens.
The measure has also divided farm groups. Organizations that represent the bigger, more conservative farmers and ranchers, like the Pork Producers Council, have expressed opposition to the measure, while the more liberal National Farmers Union has supported it.
Farmers like the Hoogestraats look down the flat gravel roads near their farm and recite the names of 10 farmers who have stopped raising hogs in the last few years.
"We might not win this thing," said Craig Hoogestraat, referring to the anti-corporate measure on the ballot. "But we're not going down without a fight."

 BODY:

Parakeet on Park
This may rank right up there with the notion of alligators in the sewer: a bright blue parakeet on a Park Avenue doormat. Now he is living in -- what else? -- a gilded cage. And the bird is a he. The salesclerks at Bernardaud, a store better known for Limoges porcelain than for avian biology, checked.
But first they had to coax him off the doormat and into the store, at Park Avenue between 60th and 61st Streets. "We tried to encourage him to do something -- get on a pencil -- but no, he was uncomfortable with that idea," said MARY KAY DENNING, a spokeswoman for the store. "We were able, with the help of a chauffeur who pulled a beach towel out of the car and someone passing by who told us that if we covered him, we could handle him." 
 MARK SCHWARZ, a lawyer who passed by while prospective brides at Bernardaud were watching the salesclerks chase the parakeet, said that the bird was "swooping around the moldings and too close to the $200 wine glasses."
Ms. Denning said that the bird, whom the salesclerks have named Barbu (it means bearded, in French), ended up in a high-ceilinged stockroom. He eventually did a, uh, swan dive for a snack, landing on someone's muffin, and was moved to a restroom ("so no one could go to the bathroom for the next six hours"), then to the cage.
Ms. Denning said she had hoped to hear from Barbu's previous owner, but so far, not a peep.
 
Madeline Moves To the Big Screen
All together now: "In an old house in Paris that was covered with vines lived 12 little girls in two straight lines." That sentence was uttered more than once at a party at Tavern on the Green after the New York premiere of "Madeline," a film based on the Ludwig Bemelmans series of books, the first of which begins with that much-memorized line.
The reviews from the crayons-and-ice-cream set were generally positive. "I liked when she sank into the water," said ADRIENNE FISHMAN, who will be 6 next month, after reciting the opening line with her sister, JULIA, 9.
CHRISTOPHER LAWFORD was doing no such recitations. "Not on your life," he said. He had a question about pronunciation: "Is it Mad-uh-linn or Mad-uh-line?" A chorus that included his daughter, SAVANNAH ROSE, 8, favored the second. "I'd never read it until I had my daughter," Mr. Lawford said.
 
Table Hopping
Table 45 has become the hangout for literary types at Della Femina, a restaurant in East Hampton, N.Y. One night, SALMAN RUSHDIE, who went underground after the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini pronounced a death sentence against him in 1989 after the publication of his novel "The Satanic Verses," had dinner at Table 45. The next night, LEONARD RIGGIO, the chief executive of Barnes and Noble, was seated at the same table. . . . "Inflation has taken place, to the tune of 6 cents," said DANNY MEYER, an owner of Gramercy Tavern and the Union Square Cafe. He was talking about the fixed-price lunches being offered by more than 100 restaurants this week, a custom begun in 1992, when the price was $19.92. "Our two restaurants were completely booked even before it was announced," he said. . . . TIM and NINA ZAGAT, compilers of restaurant guides, issued their predictions for food in the 21st century at the restaurant 21: they foresee computerized cookbooks and kitchens with "essentially one computerized food storage unit" that can freeze or cook.
 
Give Them Land, Lots of Land . . .
DAVID LETTERMAN may accumulate more than just speeding tickets in Montana. He reportedly has his eye on a ranch in bear country.
JACK SALMOND, a fourth-generation rancher, says that Mr. Letterman is considering buying a chunk of the Salmond Ranch in northwestern Montana. "We're in the talking stage now," said Mr. Salmond, who would not say how much land or how much money was being talked about. He said that he had listed 10,000 acres for sale last fall for $7 million but had taken the land off the market.
Mr. Letterman, who has made his speeding on parkways in Connecticut a running gag on his late-night talk show, visited Montana last month and was stopped in Darby for, yes, speeding. He also passed through Choteau, 250 miles northeast of Darby, where he told the Choteau Acantha newspaper, "I've never seen anything so beautiful in my life."
As for Mr. Salmond, he is not a big "Late Show" watcher. "Don't know very much about it," he said.
With his wife expecting, the radio personality DON IMUS wants a house with a nursery and a nanny's room.
Mr. Imus has filed plans to build a seven-bedroom, seven-bath house on 3.8 acres he owns in Westport, Conn. A public planning and zoning hearing is scheduled July 23. Mr. Imus needs a construction permit, as well as a demolition permit to tear down the existing two-story house on the property, which he bought last year for $4.6 million. JAMES BARRON

HEADLINE: SUNY Budget Lets College Keep Revenue

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
The trustees of the State University of New York adopted a budget yesterday that allows campuses to keep the tuition and fees they bring in, a step aimed at making the colleges more responsive to market forces.
The move is widely viewed as a harbinger of the broader transformation of the university that its board has sought for several years, but that some legislators and campus representatives have fought. 
 The colleges have been turning over their tuition revenue to a central university pot. The money has then been reallocated under a complex formula that has allowed the university to keep open smaller campuses that some see as less economically viable.
In the short term, the budget for next year gives more money to all campuses. The actual increases for the fiscal year that begins July 1 range from less than 1 percent for the five Colleges of Technology to more than 7 percent for the Binghamton, Geneseo and New Paltz campuses. No increase in tuition is envisioned.
But critics fear that in the long term, the new formula establishes a Darwinian system that will leave smaller campuses vulnerable.
"We feel that this model will lead to many campus closings," said Kenneth P. LaValle, chairman of the State Senate's Committee on Higher Education, "and that it will factionalize the state university system, pitting campuses against each other."
State legislators have long been wary of changes that could threaten campuses in their home districts. When SUNY tried to pare campuses several years ago, for example, it was stymied by legislators who fought the loss of institutions that were important to their communities economically and culturally.
But advocates of the new system said it would strengthen the colleges by encouraging them to improve their programs and attract more students.
"The colleges will have to go out and hustle," said Thomas W. Carroll, president of the Empire Foundation for Policy Research, a conservative interest group that has been pressing for a more market-oriented approach. "This is a fantastic change from the socialist cross-subsidy method that has kept people afloat by administrative fiat.
"Before," he said, "it didn't matter whether you were run well or poorly. The only thing that mattered was that you didn't close your doors, or the state legislators would get upset."
Within SUNY, the new budget is seen as a first step toward a broader system of performance-based financing. Under such a system, SUNY would allocate tax money to the campuses based on factors like the types of courses they offered and how their students scored on standardized tests. SUNY's provost, Peter Salins, has developed a preliminary list of such performance indicators that he will discuss with the colleges in the fall.
Senator LaValle and other state legislators tried unsuccessfully last week to pass legislation that would prevent SUNY from adopting a new financial system. "My fear was that if we left Albany without passing anything, the trustees would take action," Mr. LaValle said. "By adopting the budget, they have done it."
But rather than voting on a new system, the trustees, meeting at the SUNY College at Plattsburgh, adopted a budget that reflected some of the basic principles of that system.
"We never have voted on an approach," said Scott W. Steffey, SUNY's vice chancellor for university relations. "But we have changed the way we have constructed it so there are incentives, and so that it is easier to see how the money is being apportioned."
Tuition represents only about 40 percent, or $600 million, of the SUNY budget, which will total $1.6 billion next year, up 4.4 percent from this year. Most of the rest comes from state subsidies.
Although all of the state-operated campuses will see budget increases, some will be bigger than others. The university centers at Albany and Binghamton are among the winners, with increases of about 7 percent. In contrast, SUNY Buffalo and the state units at Cornell University will see increases of only about 3 percent. SUNY Stony Brook will see a 5.5 percent increase.
In New York City, the College of Optometry in Manhattan and the Health Science Center at Brooklyn will both receive increases of less than 3 percent, while the Maritime College in the Bronx will get a 4 percent increase.
SUNY officials said that for the first time, Cornell and the College of Ceramics at Alfred University have been included in the budget allocation process, rather than being handled separately, and will be treated under the same principles as the other campuses.
The new budget is based on enrollment forecasts the colleges have made for the coming year; they will be penalized if their projections are significantly different from the actual enrollment.
The changes do not apply to SUNY's 30 community colleges, which draw some of their financing from their communities.
Small colleges, which are seen as most vulnerable unless they can raise their enrollments, are being at least partly protected under the new formula. SUNY officials said that they will provide a certain level of financial support for basic operations at colleges with enrollments of 5,000 students or fewer.
The new budget also raises the amount given to colleges to match the money they bring in for sponsored research to 20 percent, from 9 percent.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Appeals Court Ruling on Microsoft

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the decision by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia overturning the injunction against the Microsoft Corporation. Judges A. Raymond Randolph and Stephen F. Williams found for the company; Judge Patricia M. Wald dissented in part.
We find that the district court erred procedurally in entering a preliminary injunction without notice to Microsoft and substantively in its implicit construction of the consent decree on which the preliminary injunction rested... 
We must decide whether the preliminary injunction was correctly granted. . . . Microsoft argues that the district court failed to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(1)'s command, "No preliminary injunction shall be issued without notice to the adverse party." We agree. Obviously the department's request for a contempt citation provided no such notice, for the governing criteria are completely different. To defeat the contempt petition, all Microsoft had to do was to show that the department failed to meet its burden of showing that the consent decree unambiguously barred its conduct. For a preliminary injunction, by contrast, traditional equitable standards would require the Government to show substantial likelihood of success on the merits (here, that the decree, properly construed, barred the conduct), plus risk of irreparable injury, lack of substantial injury to the opposing party and consistency with the public interest. ...
At oral argument the department claimed that when the Government seeks a preliminary injunction under a statute, its showing of a likelihood of success on the merits supplants the normal need for assessment of the interim risks. This is true under some circumstances. First, it is clear that if a statute confers a right to an injunction once a certain showing is made, no plaintiff -- neither governmental agencies nor private parties -- need show more than the statute specifies. . . . Second, and not entirely distinct in the cases, lurks the proposition that when a governmental entity sues to enforce a statute, irreparable injury is presumed to flow from the violation itself. . . .
The district court did need to find irreparable injury before granting the preliminary injunction. The absence of notice had the effect of precluding the introduction of evidence and argument on this requirement, and the omission was far from trivial. At oral argument, the department conceded that it had offered no evidence on the subject, and Microsoft suggested that it could have forcefully contested anything the department might have offered, alluding to information -- obviously not in the record -- that no O.E.M. original equipment manufacturer had, since entry of the preliminary injunction, sought to take advantage of its terms. . . .
Microsoft and the department engage in a brief battle over the extent to which antitrust law may be relevant to this dispute. Without wasting time on the parties' somewhat exaggerated positions, we can simply say that Microsoft is clearly right that the decree does not embody either the entirety of the Sherman Act or even all "tying" law under the act, and the department is equally right to point out that the consent decree emerged from antitrust claims, unresolved though they were, so that we must keep procompetitive goals in mind in the interpretive task. . . . However, an antitrust consent decree cannot be read as though its animating spirit were solely the antitrust laws. . . .
The court's task, then, is to discern the bargain that the parties struck; this is the sense behind the proposition that consent decrees are to be interpreted as contracts. . . . To find the meaning of an ambiguous provision we look for the intent of the parties, just as we would with a contract. . . . In that quest we may rely on the same aids to construction as we would when interpreting an ambiguous contract. . . .
For antitrust criteria, the department draws on Jefferson Parish Hosp. District No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2 (1984), for the proposition that products are distinct for tying purposes if consumer demand exists for each separately. . . . The department offers no means of distinguishing an upgrade from a separate product. Versions developed for different operating systems may be better understood as different products altogether; hence, their relevance to separateness is obscure. Distribution of software code on a separate CD-ROM shows nothing at all about whether the code is integrated into an operating system. . . .
And while the department says that the proviso would protect Microsoft from a charge that it had violated the decree by adopting a technology incompatible with other firms' products. . . . In its attempts to define the "product" I.E. Internet Explorer , the department consistently invokes the concept of "browser functionality." . . . But if functionality is the criterion of identity (which the department asserts so as to claim that the "browser functionality" in Windows 95 is the same product as I.E. 4 for other operating systems), Windows 95 looks like a tie-in of two products (MS-DOS and Windows 3.11) that were sold separately in the market: it contains the functionalities of both. On the department's reading, it should thus be prohibited unless Microsoft refrains from marketing MS-DOS separately. There is some suggestion that Microsoft has in fact continued to license MS-DOS separately, at least to end users. . . . More significantly, the consent decree does not condition its approval of Windows 95 on Microsoft's marketing behavior with respect to MS-DOS. The failure to produce the right result when applied to Windows 95, one of the situations clearly resolved by the decree, is a fatal flaw. . . .
Curiously, in both parties' readings Microsoft's behavior determines the permissibility of conditioned licensing. This would be no defect if the behavior were in some way relevant to the economic principles of tie-ins. But it is not. The department offers no theory as to how a seller's abstaining from separate marketing of the tied good might blunt the possible anticompetitive effects of bundling. . . It seems especially beside the point where the goods are complements used in fixed proportions. A monopolist who ties two such goods has no obvious reason to market the tied good separately: since all buyers of the tying good will also take the tied good, the residual market for the tied good will be minimal. . . .
Microsoft's goal was to preserve its freedom to design products that consumers would like. Antitrust scholars have long recognized the undesirability of having courts oversee product design, and any dampening of technological innovation would be at cross-purposes with antitrust law. Thus, a simple way to harmonize the parties' desires is to read the integration proviso of s IV(E)(i) a proviso in the consent decree as permitting any genuine technological integration, regardless of whether elements of the integrated package are marketed separately. This reading requires us, of course, to give substantive content to the concept of integration. We think that an "integrated product" is most reasonably understood as a product that combines functionalities (which may also be marketed separately and operated together) in a way that offers advantages unavailable if the functionalities are bought separately and combined by the purchaser. . . .
The second point is. . . . there should be some technological value to integration. Manufacturers can stick products together in ways that purchasers cannot without the link serving any purpose but an anticompetitive one. . . . Thus if there is no suggestion that the product is superior to the purchaser's combination in some respect, it cannot be deemed integrated. . . .
The test for the integration of Windows 95 then comes down to the question of whether its integrated design offers benefits when compared to a purchaser's combination of corresponding stand-alone functionalities. . . .
The short answer is thus that integration may be considered genuine if it is beneficial when compared to a purchaser combination. But we do not propose that in making this inquiry the court should embark on product-design assessment. In antitrust law, from which this whole proceeding springs, the courts have recognized the limits of their institutional competence and have on that ground rejected theories of "technological tying." A court's evaluation of a claim of integration must be narrow and deferential. . . .
We defer to neither party in interpreting the consent decree; in fact, we reject both parties' readings. We suggest here only that the limited competence of courts to evaluate high-tech product designs and the high cost of error should make them wary of second-guessing the claimed benefits of a particular design decision. . . .
The parties agree that the consent decree does not bar a challenge under the Sherman Act. . . . On the facts before us, Microsoft has clearly met the burden of ascribing facially plausible benefits to its integrated design as compared to an operating system combined with a stand-alone browser such as Netscape's Navigator. . . .
What, then, counts as the combination that brings together the two functionalities? Since neither fully exists separately, we think the only sensible answer is that the act of combination is the creation of the design that knits the two together. . . .
It seems clear that there is a reason why the integration must take place at Microsoft's level. This analysis essentially replays our comparison of Windows 95 to a bundle of MS-DOS and Windows 3.11 and concludes that the Windows 95/IE package more closely resembles Windows 95 than it does the bundle. The factual conclusion is, of course, subject to re-examination on a more complete record. On the facts before us, however, we are inclined to conclude that the Windows 95/IE package is a genuine integration; consequently, s IV(E)(i) does not bar Microsoft from offering it as one product. . .
Special masters may not decide dispositive pretrial motions. . . . The department also proposes that this is a case of such technological complexity as to be "exception al . So far as the meaning of the consent decree is concerned, that is clearly false; the words are in plain English, and if their meaning is not clear it is not because of some deep technological issue but because of uncertainties in the purposes of the parties that drafted the decree, the sort of uncertainties that pervade contract actions. . . .
The reference to the master was in effect the imposition on the parties of a surrogate judge and either a clear abuse of discretion or an exercise of wholly nonexistent discretion.

HEADLINE: Few Transit Changes Are Planned For Riders Drawn by New Passes

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
In 10 days, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will roll out the biggest discounts in the history of the city's subway and bus system: a package of monthly, weekly and daily passes that officials say will draw hundreds of thousands of riders to a system that is already saturated with passengers attracted by past fare deals.
Transit officials say they are ready to handle the extra 100 million trips a year that subway and bus riders are expected to take with the new passes. But the officials have few concrete plans to add service -- no new trains have been ordered, and the only scheduling change they have made is the cancellation of the traditional summer service cut. 
 The transit officials said that in the fall, when the full impact of the passes is felt, they would monitor the flow of passengers and add service if needed -- a process that could take months.
The expected surge in new riders will come on top of a significant increase in passengers since New York City Transit began offering discounts: free bus-to-subway transfers last July and an 11-rides-for-the-price-of-10 bulk discount in January. Weekday subway ridership for the first four months of 1998 is up by nearly 400,000 a day -- an 11 percent increase -- compared with the same period in 1996, the last year for which comparable figures are available. But the number of trains has increased by only 4 percent during that time, transit officials said yesterday.
And the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group that released a report on the state of the subway system yesterday, said the situation is even bleaker. The group contends that the transit agency's own documents show an increase of only 15 trains a day since 1996, a rise of 0.2 percent.
Whichever figure is right, there are far fewer rush-hour trains now than in 1972, the last time ridership was this high -- about 3.9 million rides a day. In that year, according to George Haikalis, a transportation consultant and former director of the Tri-State Regional Planning Commission, a now-defunct intergovernmental agency, the M.T.A. ran 435 trains into Manhattan between 8 and 9 A.M. By 1996, Mr. Haikalis said, the agency ran only 336 trains during that hour, a drop of 23 percent.
Mr. Haikalis said he found the long-term decrease "embarrassing."
"As the city's economy and income improves," he said, "you should be improving the quality of service, not running less."'
Although the M.T.A. has no current figures for how crowded its buses and subways are, the Straphangers analysis found that from October 1995 to October 1996, a subway commuter's chances of getting a seat at the height of rush hour fell to 29 percent, from 31 percent.
Bus ridership, too, spurred by the free transfers, is up by 37 percent since 1996. But while the authority boasts that it has added 2,300 buses a day since then, that amounts to only a 5 percent increase.
Christopher P. Boylan, an executive deputy director of the authority, said the crowding was generally within the agency's service guidelines.
"Are there more people on the trains and buses?" he asked. "Yes. That's good. But have you heard of any customers who were unable to use our service because there was no room for them? No. We're moving huge numbers of people and everybody gets where they want to go. We don't leave anyone anywhere."
He said the agency expected a fairly gradual increase in ridership beginning in the fall.
But Joseph Rappaport, staff coordinator for the Straphangers Campaign, said that providing the bare minimum of service was no way to introduce the new passes, which will be available starting July 4 and offer unlimited rides for $63 a month, $17 a week or $4 a day.
"Will there be a huge crush in the fall?" he asked. "Well, there's already a crush. The proper response would be to add enough service so that riders who are already being crushed can more comfortably get to or from work."
Many regular commuters on the N train -- ranked last in the Straphangers report, which measured frequency, reliability, cleanliness and crowding -- said last night that they feared the new passes as much as they looked forward to them.
"It's been very crowded, especially during rush hour, over the past few months," said Raquel Herreros, 48, an editorial assistant in midtown on her way home to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. "You can never even think of getting a seat. People are pushing more to get on the train. With new cards giving more free rides it's going to be ridiculous."
Transit officials are expecting only a small surge in ridership during the summer, when school is out and many commuters are on vacation. To accommodate it, they canceled the traditional summer service cut of 5 to 10 percent. But as for fall, Lawrence G. Reuter, the president of New York City Transit, the M.T.A. arm that runs the subways and buses, stated in a letter to the parent agency, "We have an extensive monitoring program to measure ridership and will use the information from this program to determine where and when additional service is required."
Mr. Boylan said that adding trains is a complex process that requires changing train operators' schedules and coordinating train movements, among other things.
"There are a lot of things that go into putting a train out there," he said. "It's a real ballet." Typically, service changes go into effect four months after they are approved.
Gene Russianoff, the staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, said the agency's cautious approach to adding service amounted to "using the riders as laboratory rats and watching us in our cages."
Mr. Russianoff said that he doubted the M.T.A. had the money to add more service and accused the agency of being too shy to ask Albany.
Assemblywoman Catherine T. Nolan, a Queens Democrat who sits on the board that reviews the M.T.A.'s capital program, said that the agency's Executive Director, E. Virgil Conway, saw himself "more as a personal friend of the Governor" who was reluctant to displease him. She added that the agency did not make much effort to get more from the Legislature.
"I don't think there's much advocacy going on at the agency for funds," she said.
But Mr. Boylan said that there is $848 million in the state budget for the M.T.A. this year, an increase of $159 million from last year, and that much of the increase is earmarked for adding service.
The Straphangers report on the subways, which compared service in the last half of 1997 with that in the last half of 1996, found overall improvements on four measures: breakdown rate, regularity of trains, cleanliness and audible announcements. But the report claimed that the frequency of rush-hour trains -- ranging from every two and a half minutes on the No. 6 line to every nine minutes on the B and C lines -- was virtually unchanged, despite a 200,000-trip-a-day increase in ridership from December 1996 to December 1997.
The only increases in weekday service that Mr. Russianoff said he found in a review of all of New York City Transit's monthly agendas were six additional trains a day on the No. 6 line and nine more trains on the No. 7 line, which was rated the best in the system. Transit officials said they had no figures available on rush-hour service during those two periods.
Bus statistics released in April showed that bunching of buses and gaps in service had increased on 80 percent of the lines that the authority monitors.
"I would give the M.T.A. credit for modest improvements made under a very tight budget," Mr. Russianoff said. "But those improvements have to be seen against a backdrop of failure to add service."

Table: "REPORT CARD: Rating the Subway's Performance"
A review of subway service by the Straphangers Campaign, a subway riders advocady group, has found that the No. 7 line is the best in the city and the N the worst. The group rates the lines according to criteria below, using a complex formula that assigns a "token rating" to each line to use as a yardstick for overall service, ranging from $1.20 for the No. 7 to 65 cents for the N. The survey examined all lines except shuttles. Table shows results of the review. (Source: Straphangers Campaign)(pg. B6)

HEADLINE: MICROSOFT WINNER IN APPEAL TO KEEP SOFTWARE INTACT

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
In an opinion that undercut a central argument in the Government's antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation, a Federal appeals court today struck down a lower court's ruling that had ordered the company to alter the way it sold its software for navigating the Internet.
The decision was a setback for the Justice Department and for Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who issued the order last year requiring Microsoft to offer its Windows operating system software separate from its software for navigating the World Wide Web. 
 Judge Jackson is scheduled to preside over the trial in September for the antitrust suit, which was filed last month by the Justice Department and 20 states.
The appeals court's ruling today struck down a preliminary injunction that Judge Jackson issued against Microsoft in December after the Justice Department had argued in a separate case that Microsoft was illegally using its monopoly in operating system software to gain an unfair advantage in the market for browser software.
But in its ruling today, the appeals court said that Judge Jackson had "erred procedurally" by issuing a preliminary injunction without giving Microsoft a chance to present its case, and "substantively" by misinterpreting the intent of antitrust law.
Stating a principle that legal experts say would clearly apply to the new antitrust suit as well, the court said that Microsoft had the right to determine what features and functions to include in its operating system as long as the combination "offers advantages unavailable" if a consumer were to purchase separate software products and combine them to achieve similar capabilities.
The same bundling of browser and operating system is a central feature of Microsoft's latest version of Windows -- Windows 98 -- which goes on sale Thursday, and it is one of the core complaints of the Justice Department and 20 states in their current suit against Microsoft.
Today's ruling is not likely to have any immediate impact on what consumers get when they buy personal computers. Page D1.
But the appellate decision does signal that the Justice Department will likely face a hostile legal atmosphere as it heads toward the Sept. 8 trial.
"Antitrust scholars have long recognized the undesirability of having courts oversee product design, and any dampening of technological innovation would be at cross-purposes with antitrust law," said the text of today's decision by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
"We suggest here only that the limited competence of courts to evaluate high-tech product designs and the high cost of error should make them wary of second-guessing the claimed benefits of a particular design decision," the text said.
The Justice Department issued a terse, three-sentence statement expressing "disappointment."
"We're reviewing the opinion to assess our options," the statement said. "We remain confident that the evidence and our legal arguments in our antitrust case filed May 18 will demonstrate that Microsoft's conduct has violated Federal antitrust law."
But Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust office, said: "This cuts the legs out from under the Justice Department on their new case. It's potentially devastating."
Microsoft's leaders were jubilant, and investors seemed to share their enthusiasm, bidding up shares of the company's stock $4.9375 in heavy trading today, to a closing price of $100.75. Meanwhile, shares of the Netscape Communications Corporation, Microsoft's only direct competitor in browser software, fell on the news, ending the day at $26.1875, down 56.25 cents.
"What we learned from this decision is that integrating new features into our products is a good thing to do, and that's what these judges say is the right thing to do," Robert Herbold, Microsoft's chief operating officer, said.
Today's ruling arose from a suit the Justice Department filed against Microsoft last October, charging the company with violating a 1995 antitrust settlement by forcing computer manufacturers to accept the company's Internet browsing software as a condition of being able to install Windows on their machines. After Judge Jackson issued his injunction in December, Microsoft appealed, leading to today's decision.
The antitrust suit that the Government filed last month contains several charges. But a key allegation is that Microsoft is, once again, illegally bundling Internet Explorer, the Web browser, with Windows 98. The ruling today indicated that this particular panel of judges did not see bundling as a problem.
The new suit against Microsoft, however, includes several charges that are not mentioned in today's opinion. It attempts to overturn Microsoft's requirement that computer manufacturers set up new computers so that consumers see the Windows "desktop," or opening screen, the first time they turn on their machines. It also seeks to end exclusionary contracts with providers of Internet services and other on-line services that are intended to give an advantage to Microsoft.
The judges' ruling was unanimous in most of its parts. Sitting on the three-judge panel were A. Raymond Randolph, Patricia M. Wald and Stephen F. Williams. But Judge Wald issued a dissent to the part of the opinion that said, in effect, that Microsoft should be allowed to bundle almost any features it wants with the company's operating system, if the bundling benefits buyers.
"The majority test would seem to permit Microsoft to 'integrate' word-processing programs, spreadsheets, financial-management software and virtually any now-separate software product into its operating system by identifying some minimal synergy associated with such 'integration,' " Judge Wald wrote. "In effect, the majority has fashioned a broad exemption from antitrust law for operating system design.
"To my mind," Judge Wald added, "this reading does not impose nearly enough scrutiny on 'integration.' "
Senior Government officials said they were cheered by Judge Wald's dissent and noted that their new case, if it were appealed, would not necessarily be heard by the same appellate panel that ruled today.
The court also ruled that Judge Jackson had erred when he appointed a "special master" to advise him on technical matters when he considered the first case last fall. Microsoft complained that the individual chosen, Lawrence Lessig, a law professor from Harvard University, was biased.
The same appeals court had tentatively suspended Mr. Lessig's appointment, and in the ruling today the court dismissed him from the case. The court ruled that Judge Jackson had erred in granting too much power to someone who was not himself a judge.
The Justice Department could appeal today's ruling to the full appeals court, or to the Supreme Court. In one sense such an appeal might not seem to be a high priority, since the old case deals with integrating a Web browser in Windows 95, a product now superseded by Windows 98.
But Mr. Litan, director of Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution, suggested that the department might want to pursue an appeal as a stalling tactic.
"Given this ruling today, Microsoft could be expected to come in with a motion to dismiss the new case -- or for a summary judgement of the case," Mr. Litan said. "To forestall that, they might decide they need to appeal."

HEADLINE: Preschoolers Gain From Public-Private Tie

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Deanna Frazee (letter, June 18) should examine the work of her professional colleagues at the thousands of public, academic, K-12 and corporate library World Wide Web sites to see that though the Internet may appear disorganized, it is organizable. 
 Upon reconsideration, she might recognize the historical precedents of the e-rate discount program, including rural electrification and universal telephone service.
This investment would help unleash the power of our nationwide system of libraries to provide access to professionally organized collections of digital information. It would also result in a decrease in the number of maddening searches for Internet-based information, which is an economic plague on the country.

HEADLINE: AT&T IS NEAR DEAL FOR NO. 2 COMPANY IN CABLE TV IN U.S.

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
The AT&T Corporation is close to an agreement to acquire the nation's second-largest cable television operator in a deal that could sharply expand AT&T's ability to provide Internet access and local telephone service.
The deal between AT&T and Tele-Communications Inc. is expected to be worth at least $25 billion in stock. A final agreement had not been reached late last night, but a deal could be announced as soon as today, an executive close to Tele-Communications and an official who had been briefed on the talks said last night. 
 AT&T is seeking to acquire only Tele-Communications' cable properties, which connect to homes, not its programming unit, which creates television programs, said a person close to Tele-Communications, known as TCI. Tele-Communications' programming unit, Liberty Media, already trades as a separate stock. Its ultimate fate is unclear. AT&T is prepared to pay about $50 for each share of Tele-Communications' stock, the person said. That would represent a premium of more than 28 percent to Tele-Communications' closing stock price of $38.6875 yesterday.
Any deal between the two companies is likely to face a rigorous review by regulators including the Federal Communications Commission. If the deal wins approval it will firmly put the stamp of C. Michael Armstrong, AT&T's new chairman, upon one of America's most venerable corporations.
A merger between AT&T and Tele-Communications would be the biggest sign yet that trying to deliver high-speed access to the Internet and other advanced services is one of the strongest imperatives in today's business world. In recent years, the Internet has emerged as a new sort of media that could rival radio and television in its impact on the nation's economy and culture. The technological bottleneck that has kept cyberspace from becoming a true mass media has been the difficulty in transmitting large amounts of digital data to everyday homes.
Consumers gain access to the Internet at speeds a mere fraction of those available to people in modern offices. That has kept the process of linking to cyberspace a relatively awkward procedure in some ways akin to using a ham radio.
But by acquiring Tele-Communications, which serves 14.4 million customers, AT&T would gain direct access to homes and apartments for the first time since the leading long-distance company spun off its local telephone operations in 1984.
The importance of the Internet to AT&T became clear last week when news emerged that the company had engaged in preliminary discussions to merge with America Online Inc., the nation's biggest provider of access to cyberspace. AOL rebuffed AT&T, though the two could still strike a marketing alliance.
Although new telecommunications carriers boast more advanced networks, AT&T retains a vast capacity to transmit information of all sorts from coast to coast at lightning speeds. By merging with Tele-Communications and gaining its many wires into homes, AT&T would acquire an ability to bypass its own ornery progeny, the Baby Bell local phone companies. That could allow AT&T to create an end-to-end network that would allow the company to deliver not only Internet data but also everyday phone calls.
With their control of the copper telephone wires that stretch into most every home and apartment, the Bells have appeared to have an advantage in some ways over long-distance companies like AT&T and MCI Communications.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 cleared the way for the Bells to enter the long-distance market once they convinced regulators that they had opened their local networks to potential competitors. Likewise, long-distance telephone companies won the right to compete in local markets. The Bells have not yet won approval to offer long-distance service, but were they to gain the go-ahead, they could be expected to win large chunks of the long-distance market away from traditional long-distance carriers by buying long-distance capacity in bulk and reselling it at a profit.
Long-distance companies like AT&T, however, would face the huge cost of building elements of local networks on their own. Indeed, AT&T agreed in January to acquire Teleport Communications Group Inc., a competitive local phone company, for $11.3 billion in a bid to jump-start that effort.
Speculation about a possible alliance between AT&T and a major cable company has been rife in the industry for months and caused cable stocks to rise sharply yesterday.
The cable industry has been spending billions of dollars to upgrade its lines to offer more data options at faster speeds. TCI in particular has been busy upgrading the capacity and speed of its cable systems. TCI is one of the leading companies behind At Home, the cable industry's broadest venture to offer high-speed Internet access to consumers.
The telephone and cable television industries have been locked in a battle over which sector would be first to provide high-speed Internet access to consumers.
In some ways an AT&T-Tele-Communications deal would represent a return to a strategy tried by Tele-Communications' chief executive, John C. Malone, in 1993, with a proposed merger with the Bell Atlantic Corporation. That deal later collapsed as visions of cable companies' delivering phone service and telephone companies' delivering movies into living rooms failed to take shape. In many respects TCI is responsible for the evolution of the nation's cable system into what it is today. The company traces its roots to 1956, when Bob Magness, a Texas Panhandle rancher, sold some cattle to build his first cable TV system. Nine years later Mr. Magness, who died in 1996, moved the company to Denver to serve small towns in the Rocky Mountains and hired John Malone, a 32-year-old executive at General Instrument, to help him expand.
The effort grew into a company with more than $7.5 billion in annual sales and cable television operations in more than 40 states, Argentina, Brazil, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and Spain.

U.S. Butterfat Shortage Could Raise Food Prices

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 23

 BODY:
A national shortage of butterfat, used in ice cream, cheese, chocolate and other rich foods, could mean record prices for those foods this summer.
The price of Grade AA butter has risen to $1.95 a pound, or 73 percent higher than a year ago, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Prices at the supermarket could rise to $3 a pound by late summer, economists said, from about $2 a pound. 
 Prices are rising in part because food manufacturers have been adding more fat to their products this year, while cows are still producing the same 3.6 pounds of butterfat for every 100 pounds of milk. Butterfat is the fatty part of milk that is used for butter and added to foods.
Another reason for the shortage is that the Government no longer subsidizes butter prices. And high tariffs are keeping butter imports down.

HEADLINE: GAINS TAX BREAK APPEARS AT HAND

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
Congressional leaders agreed today on a plan to give investors a break on capital gains taxes, attaching the measure to an overhaul of the Internal Revenue Service that appears headed toward speedy final passage.
The change, agreed to over several days of negotiations among members of both parties, would reduce to 12 months from 18 months the period that investors must hold stocks, bonds and other assets to qualify for the most favorable capital gains tax rate. The change would be retroactive, effective for all sales as of Jan. 1, 1998. 
 Although the 18-month holding period was created by last year's tax law at the Clinton Administration's insistence in an effort to reward long-term investment and discourage speculation, Administration officials said tonight that they expected the President to sign the new legislation after final passage by both houses.
Republican leaders are trying to keep their tax-cutting efforts in the limelight as they begin gearing up for the Congressional elections this fall. So, now that they have won agreement to reduce the holding period necessary for the most favorable tax rate on capital gains, they plan to turn to efforts to reduce the rate itself. Speaker Newt Gingrich will propose on Wednesday that the top rate on capital gains be reduced to 15 percent from 20 percent, adding the proposal to an already lengthy tax-cutting wish list that Republicans have yet to find the money to pay for.
The change to the capital gains holding period was one of a number of issues settled today as House and Senate negotiators reconciled the slightly differing versions of the I.R.S. overhaul bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support by both chambers. Republican leaders said they expected the final version of the bill to win passage in the House this week and in the Senate next month.
The bill would set in motion the most sweeping overhaul of the agency in four decades. It would create an independent oversight board, provide taxpayers a range of new legal protections in disputes with the I.R.S. and spur a broad internal reorganization of the agency.
It was precisely the bill's broad bipartisan support, and the likelihood that President Clinton would not dare veto it, that emboldened Republicans to add the provision shortening the capital gains holding period.
The provision was proposed by Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who early this year made the change a top legislative priority. Mr. Archer said today that the measure would make calculating capital gains taxes simpler for millions of people who, as a result of the 1997 law, had to grapple this year with a three-tier rate system that many taxpayers complained was excessively complex.
But the change would also amount to a tax cut for people who sold stocks or other assets after holding them between a year and 18 months. Here is why:
Under last year's tax law, gains on investments held for 12 months or less were taxed as ordinary income. Gains on investments held from 12 to 18 months were also taxed as ordinary income, although only to a maximum rate of 28 percent. Gains on investments held more than 18 months were taxed at a maximum rate of 20 percent, except for people in the 15 percent income tax bracket, who faced a maximum capital gains rate of 10 percent.
But if the agreement struck today becomes law, only gains on investments held a year or less will be taxed as ordinary income, while gains on investments held more than a year will be subject to the 10 percent capital gains rate for people in the 15 percent bracket and the 20 percent maximum capital gains rate for everyone else.
The I.R.S. has not yet determined how many people paid the intermediate rate -- the rate on assets held between 12 and 18 months -- in calculating their taxes for 1997. For 1996, the most recent year for which figures are available, 16.6 million tax returns reported a capital gain.
Congressional aides said Mr. Archer's provision would cost the Government about $2 billion over 10 years, by effectively reducing the tax bill for people who sell investments after holding them 12 to 18 months.
Capital gains taxes have been debated by economists and politicians for decades, and have been the source of bitter political disputes between Democrats, who say cutting the rates amounts to a giveaway to the rich, and Republicans, who say that lower rates spur investment and help improve the economy's long-term growth capacity.
In proposing a rate cut, Mr. Gingrich seems determined to reopen that debate. Aides say he will argue that Congress has more room to cut capital gains taxes than official revenue estimates would suggest because Congress has consistently underestimated how much revenue will flow into Government coffers after a rate cut.
Many Republicans believe that capital gains are no longer an issue only for the wealthy, given the widespread stock holdings among the middle class. But Republicans have already promised to push this year for a reduction in the so-called marriage penalty, the anomaly in the tax code that yields a higher tax bill for many two-income married couples than for two single people with the same incomes. They are also pressing for reductions in estate taxes.
But Mr. Clinton has signaled his opposition to any large-scale tax cut this year. And Republicans are feuding among themselves over how deeply they are willing to cut.
In all, the I.R.S. legislation will cost $13 billion over 10 years, mostly from revenue that the Government will not collect because of the new rules protecting taxpayers from aggressive collection action by the agency.
To help pay for the bill, House and Senate negotiators agreed to a provision offered by Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, that will encourage some relatively wealthy elderly people to shift savings from one form of individual retirement account to another.
While the shift has long-term benefits to the individual, it creates an immediate tax liability that will generate an estimated $8 billion over 10 years. Democrats had strongly opposed the provision, saying that by the second decade it would start costing the Government billions of dollars a year in lost revenue.

HEADLINE: Panel Approves Deep Cuts in Programs Championed by Clinton

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
Setting Congress on a collision course with President Clinton, a House panel today approved a proposal to cut back the President's education initiatives as well as eliminate the annual financing for home heating subsidies for the poor.
The proposal provides substantial increases for the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, underscoring the Republicans' emphasis on popular health and research programs. 
 At the same time, it takes a $2.6 billion bite out of Clinton Administration priorities, cutting the Goals 2000 education program in half, eliminating the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, terminating the Summer Youth jobs program and decreasing money for tutoring disadvantaged children.
The energy assistance program, which costs $1.1 billion, pays for home heating for 4.4 million poor households. Two-thirds of the recipients earn less than $8,000 a year. The summer jobs program spends $871 million for employment of 530,000 young people.
The proposal, passed by the subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services by a vote of 8 to 7, calls for the deepest cuts so far as the Republican-controlled Congress works its way through 13 appropriations bills that Congress must pass to keep the Government running in the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1.
Administration officials said tonight that the President would almost certainly veto the measure in its current form.
Mr. Clinton himself, in a statement, called the cuts "arbitrary" and "extreme."
"This bill is out of step with our values and the wrong vision for America's future," he said.
House Democrats said the cuts were so extreme that the Republicans were setting the stage for a confrontation that could result in the kind of standoff that shut down the Government two years ago and damaged the Republicans' image with the public -- a gamble that some aides said Republicans might be willing to take this year because the President appeared to be politically weaker than he had in the past.
Republicans said they were strait-jacketed by last year's budget agreement, which virtually froze discretionary spending, and they played down the need for social programs.
"I regret that we don't have more money to throw at problems," said Representative Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, chairman of the Appropriations Committee. "But it's the real world."
But Republicans also acknowledged that the bill was constructed by House leaders to attract the maximum support of the House's vocal conservatives. This is part of the Republican strategy to activate the party's base of conservative voters in the November elections, when many other voters, content with the strong economy, may not be motivated to go to the polls.
The problem is, the proposal is so appealing to conservatives that it may alienate Republican moderates, without whom it could not pass. This could deepen the factions within the party and weaken its chances of retaining control of the House.
The full Appropriations Committee is to vote on the proposed cuts in mid-July, and then the bill will move to the House floor.
The cuts in domestic social programs help Congress keep within the spending limits it agreed to last year with the Administration to balance the budget. They are not designed to make room for the tax cuts that Republicans are promoting as their main election-year agenda, but they could if Congress changes its rules to allow tax cuts to come from discretionary spending. At the moment, tax cuts can come only from entitlements, which are not discretionary.
The President has asked for discretionary spending of about $538 billion for next year, up from $523 billion this year. The House has proposed spending $532 billion and the Senate about $534 billion, sums that because of inflation amount to a virtual spending freeze. For example, the bill's $153 million increase for Head Start, which is $160 million below what the President requested, will not add up to much.
Mr. Obey said the Republicans were cutting programs to come up with money for medical research that would have come from tobacco companies under a bill that died last week in the Senate.
"By killing the tobacco bill, Republicans have made it much harder to fund the President's health initiatives," Mr. Obey said.
The labor-education bill increases financing for the National Institutes of Health by $1.3 billion, up more than 9 percent from this year and $126 million more than the President has requested. It increases money for the disease control centers by $202 million over this year, $89 million more than the President sought.
On policy matters, the bill bans the use of Federal money for research using human embryos, bans the distribution of needles and syringes for the injection of any illegal drug and prohibits Federal financing for a rerun of the teamsters election.
Today's cuts in the labor-education subcommittee follow House votes on Monday to increase spending on local energy and water projects and on military building.
The House approved $21.1 billion in energy and water programs, or about $700 million more than the President requested. These include about 200 local projects for flood control and stopping beach erosion, projects eagerly sought by lawmakers in an election year.
But it sharply reduced Mr. Clinton's request for more money for research into solar power and other forms of renewable energy like wind. It also cut his request for more money to maintain the nation's nuclear weapons arsenal.

Mayors Ask for Right To Impose New Taxes

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
A coalition of urban mayors told a state commission yesterday that cities should be able to impose new taxes to help reduce property taxes.
Speaking before Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's Property Tax Commission, Mayor Sharpe James of Newark also said that properties exempt from taxes, including churches and government buildings, should pay a special fee for police, fire department and other local services. 
 The New Jersey Urban Mayors Association also wants state aid pegged to inflation, and wants education costs to be shifted from local to state taxes. The commission's chairwoman, Barbara L. Cannon, who is the mayor of Old Bridge, said the panel would issues recommendations to the Governor in August.

For Los Angeles Youths, Lessons in Architecture and Life

BYLINE: By Frances Anderton 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
MERCHANT STREET is a tattered row of produce warehouses and auto body shops, its littered sidewalks and cracked street home to the poor and to drug addicts. This is not a pretty part of town, but here in the heart of what is known as skid row is a jewel.
At the back of an asphalt parking lot, in a wall decorated with dancing colored letters, a door gives a view into a charming urban courtyard. A cheerful ceramic fountain is covered in hand-painted hearts, fruits, flowers and birds amid ripening orange trees. Running almost the length of the courtyard is the glass front facade of a large, bow-trussed building. On any given day, the space inside is filled with children drawing, painting, acting or making music. 
 This is Inner-City Arts, a nonprofit arts school that is both an enlightened model for arts education and a showcase building where education is embellished by architectural example. Inner-City Arts, founded in 1989, provides visual and performing arts classes and English language instruction to students from public elementary schools -- largely the offspring of immigrants from Mexico and Central America who work in the local garment and manufacturing industries.
The school was founded by Bob Bates, an artist and teacher, and Irwin Jaeger, a Beverly Hills real estate investor who decided there had to be more to life, as he says, "than working, taking vacations and going to charity dinners." Their aim was to fill a void in arts education created by Proposition 13, a property tax cut initiative approved 20 years ago this month by California voters that slashed financing for public services and schools. In the year after its passage, said Beth Tishler, the school's executive director, virtually "all arts curriculum was eliminated from the public schools."
There are now more than 200 nonprofit arts programs in Los Angeles, many deemed excellent, but Inner-City Arts is rare in that it boasts, in its converted 8,000-square-foot auto body shop, an inspiring home, where the architecture elevates the social and arts-education experiences. The building, officially called the Mark Taper Center/Inner-City Arts, was designed by Michael Maltzan Architecture, with Marmol & Radziner Architecture and Construction. Mr. Maltzan, a protege of Frank Gehry and the project architect on the Disney Concert Hall planned for downtown Los Angeles, said that he felt compelled "to do something" after the city's 1992 riots and that he did the work pro bono.
"L.A. was my adopted city," he said. "To see it rip itself apart was devastating."
Inner-City Arts is expansive and bold in its sculptural forms, with light pouring in through its vast window wall. The plan, described by Mr. Maltzan as "a village of objects" around a central courtyard, affords views from one area to another -- "limitless horizons," he says -- and flexibility: spaces are constantly used in different ways.
The design is also an object lesson in construction. Children study the raw surfaces -- the unadorned brick walls, the timber frame partly clad in plasterboard, the exposed trusses, the roll-up garage doors. They draw inspiration for their drawings and paintings from the strong, simple shapes. "Kids use the building as material for some of their art projects," Ms. Tishler said. "They talk about how the building was put together, the ways in which they contribute to the changing and molding of the building."
Many children live in lamentable conditions in apartments for transients or in housing projects. "I love it -- it's big"; "it's fun"; "it has pictures all around," were some reactions of a group of 7-year-olds on a recent visit. Nick Estrada, 18, a former pupil and now a volunteer there, said, "Inner-City Arts is my home."
Having started with 300 children from one school, Inner-City Arts now caters to 8,000 children annually from 11 public schools who attend classes twice a week for six weeks. More schools are clamoring to be included. In 1994, the school moved from two temporary bungalows to its current premises, at 720 South Kohler Street. (One entrance is off Merchant Street.) It has bought two adjacent industrial buildings and intends to triple in size, with plans that include animation studios.
The school -- now backed by an impressive list of donors, like the National Endowment for the Arts and the Mark Taper Foundation, which supports, among other things, social services and the arts -- has developed a unique relationship with the Los Angeles Unified School District. The district provides transportation and security and has helped the school create a program for teaching English through art.
"This private-public partnership is a national model," said Leticia Quezada, a past president of the Los Angeles Board of Education. "The quality of the arts experience the children are receiving is phenomenal, 400 percent better than it would be in the school classroom. There's a sense of confidence in the arts experience those children are getting, and we want to see it extended to other schools."
Thanks in part to programs like this, attitudes toward arts education have begun to change. Buoyed by a revived economy, California politicians have, like their national counterparts, put education on the front burner. And arts education has crept back onto the agenda in part because of lobbying from the entertainment industry. "There's great demand for talented visual artists, but unfortunately we have to get people from outside California and the U.S.," said Scott Ross, a co-founder, with the director James Cameron, of Digital Domain, a visual effects studio in Los Angeles.
Delaine Easton, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, has called for the restoration of arts education in California public schools. And last March the Los Angeles school district passed stringent arts graduation requirements for all Los Angeles public schools.
"The hard part now is the implementation," said Don Dustin, the Los Angeles school district's director of visual and performing arts. "We do not have the resources, the background, the personnel." It is at this point that Inner-City Arts, only nine years ago a modest alternative, has moved center stage.
While Inner-City Arts may be a curricular model, it is less likely to be an architectural one. Because many public schools are struggling simply to keep roofs from leaking and bathrooms cleaned, concern for the surroundings as an educational asset is not a priority.
After the construction of Inner-City Arts, Mr. Maltzan designed a new arts complex, completed in March, at Harvard/Westlake School, a private, affluent junior-senior high school in North Hollywood. It is an equally forceful architectural composition of art rooms and art gallery. Perhaps most important, the buildings surround a much-used communal plaza. Enrollment in art classes has increased since the opening.
But even at Harvard-Westlake and Inner-City Arts, Mr. Maltzan initially faced resistance to lavishing effort on the architecture. At Inner-City Arts, he said, "they were used to living off donated paper." At Harvard-Westlake, the school deemed teachers and computers paramount and architecture as enclosure. "In lay people's minds and the minds of most trustees," said Thomas Hudnut, Harvard-Westlake's headmaster, "architecture implies added expense. It's not until someone catches the contagion of creativity and inspiration of architecture that one appreciates what it can do."
At present the challenge is to get art back into the schools. Perhaps architecture will follow.

HEADLINE: Scarlett, Rhett and the Old South at Their Most Colorful;
Giving New Life to a Beloved but Faded Panorama of the Civil War

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, June 24

 BODY:
"Gone With the Wind" has been released in theaters eight times since 1939, has been shown numerous times on television and has been a top rental at video stores for the last two decades.
So why spend $10 million to $12 million to pain stakingly restore and reissue the Civil War drama, which opens tomorrow in 200 theaters around the nation? The restoration project is largely the result of Ted Turner's passion for the classic. "Ted just loves this movie," said Roger L. Mayer, president of the Turner Entertainment Company. "He's the force behind it." 
 What spurred its restoration was not just Mr. Turner's affection for "Gone With the Wind," which the Atlanta-based media mogul acquired when Turner Broadcasting purchased the rights to the MGM film library in 1986, but more important, the huge successes of James Cameron's "Titanic" and the re-released "Star Wars" trilogy.
"It motivated us to consider another theatrical release of 'Gone With the Wind,"' said Mr. Mayer. Another motive was, quite simply, to one-up "Titanic." Mr. Mayer said: "There was all this talk about 'Titanic' being the most successful picture of all time. We knew if you updated the grosses to today's dollar, then 'Gone With the Wind' would have, in fact, grossed more and been seen by more people than 'Titanic.' We wanted to point that out. It was fun."
In 1939, "Gone With the Wind," at 3 hours and 40 minutes, was the longest movie ever made, and the most expensive, costing $4.25 million. An adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's saga about the old South, it starred Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Leslie Howard and Olivia de Havilland and was produced by David O. Selznick and directed by Victor Fleming from a screenplay by Sidney Howard. The score was by Max Steiner. The film went through four directors, two cinematographers and 11 writers and, like "Titanic," was initially derided in Hollywood as a disaster. The costs and various crises on the set stirred rival executives and others to call it "David's Folly."
Yet the staying power of the film, which won 10 Oscars, is underscored by the fact that nearly 60 years after it was first released, the movie's ticket sales, if adjusted for inflation, would make it the all-time box office champion. And just last week, the American Film Institute placed it fourth on its list of the 100 best American films.
Filmgoers have not seen anything quite like the restored "Gone With the Wind" in nearly 30 years, the industry executives and experts who worked on the project said. "This is the way the picture was photographed and originally printed -- this is the way the picture was intended to be seen,"said Mr. Mayer, who is also a specialist in preservation and restoration. "Add to that we have a new remastered digital soundtrack, which makes it sound like the picture was made recently. For many people this will be an entirely new way of looking at and hearing 'Gone With the Wind.' "
Ron Jarvis, the president of Technicolor, which provided the nascent film-processing technology for Selznick's production and revived the dye-transfer process to restore the film, said: "The images are sharper than they've ever been. The colors are more true. These prints are better than what people saw in 1939. In fact, look at it -- it looks as good or better than most of the stuff that we see today."
As Mr. Jarvis spoke, he sat in a screening room at his offices in Universal City watching a dual screen that depicted scenes from an older version of the movie, a classic Civil War drama and love story, and from the new version. The differences were pronounced. Scarlett (Vivien Leigh) and Rhett (Clark Gable) -- as well as hundreds of Civil War soldiers -- are simply more vivid, almost three-dimensional, and far less grainy. The colors -- especially reds, greens and blues -- are sharp, almost brilliant.
Two years ago, Turner Broadcasting, which included New Line Cinema, merged with Time Warner. More recently, Mr. Turner met with Robert A. Daly and Terry Semel, the co-chairmen of Warner Brothers, and they agreed to restore "Gone With the Wind," and asked New Line to distribute it. By all accounts, the three men believed that moviegoers, especially in the summer, might crave a lavish, escapist saga.
 
Reviving a Process Unused for Decades
The making of "Gone With the Wind" nearly 60 years ago was a saga in itself for Selznick and his production team, a complex film process involving special cameras fitted with mirrors and prisms and the synchronized exposure of three strips of film. It wasn't even color film. Three rolls of black and white film rolled through the camera, each registering cyan, magenta or yellow.
Restoration of the film, which had not been reprinted using Technicolor since 1961, meant the revival of the three-strip dye-transfer process. Computer technology allowed technicians and graphic artists to examine the negative frame by frame and repair about 12 1/2 minutes of footage by removing scratches and photochemical imperfections.
The dye-transfer method transfers dyes directly to the film itself in a photomechanical process similar to printing, as opposed to the conventional photochemical process that has been in use since 1974. That method involved a two-step printing and developing process in which the color dyes are chemically formed in the film itself.
Essentially, dye-transfer technology results in vivid contrasts between white and black, and clear separation of colors, especially reds, greens and blues. (The last time it was used in Hollywood was for "The Godfather Part II" in 1974).
The film will also be seen in its original aspect ratio (a term used to define the relationship between a film's projected height and width) instead of the wide-screen display that cuts off the top of the frame.
Mitch Goldman, New Line's president of marketing and distribution, said the new release involved an overture in movie theaters of the famed Max Steiner score as well as an intermission. "Most people have not seen this in theaters, which is the way it's supposed to be seen," Mr. Goldman said.
Over the years, ticket sales for the film have reached an extraordinary $192 million: it is in 25th place in domestic revenues. But none of the 24 films that preceded it were made earlier than 1975.
The video, which came out in 1985, has also been successful. More than 1.5 million copies s have been sold at a hefty price, generally $88.98. The television rights to "Gone With the Wind," were sold to NBC in 1976 for what was then the record price of $5 million.
 
A Busy History In Television
Three years later, CBS signed a 20-year licensing agreement for the movie. But less than 10 years after that, Turner Broadcasting bought the television rights, and the film has since aired on Turner Classic Movies, the Turner Broadcasting System and Turner Network Television.
"This is the only movie that seems to work in all media, but particularly in theatrical release," said Mr. Mayer, the Turner executive. "It's a romantic, historical drama, based on a best seller that has continued to be a best seller for 60 years. There are very few pieces of material that can make that claim."

Chart: "Restoring the Bloom To Vivien Leigh's Cheeks"
In its new version, which reaches theaters tomorrow, above right, Gone With the Wind will look brighter and more vivid than prints screened in recent years like the one above at left. Why? A long-standard coloring process that disappeared in 1974 has been revived to make new prints. Here is how the process works.
1. A negative is made from a positive image of the film. This film had been hand-restored in the early 1980's.
2. Using filters, the negative is separated into three positives sensitive to different colors.
3. Cyan, magenta and yellow dye in varying combinations and intensities are applied to the separations.
4. Each separation applies its dye to blank film, just as a printing plate on a press would, in a process called dye transfer. Together the three dyes create a range of colors.(Sources: Technicolor; New Line Cinema)

A Timeout For Home Sales

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

THERE'S a kind of hush all over New York -- New York City's residential real estate market, that is.
Whether hush or hiccup or breathing spell -- all terms used by brokers to describe the market since the beginning of June -- the city's biggest companies agree on one thing: the frenzy has abated, at least for now. 
 While the market usually loses momentum in summer, many real estate brokers and agents say that this June is different from last June.
"There was no lull last year," said Peter Marra, president of William B. May Real Estate, a company with 135 agents in Manhattan and Brooklyn. "There is a lull right now." Clark Halstead, managing partner at the Halstead Property Company, said accepted offers for this month are 10 percent below last June's, following a steady rise in the last five months. He called the current market "a kind of correction, like the stock market makes."
Alan Rogers, managing director at Douglas Elliman, the city's largest residential firm, said he felt the market was at a plateau, calling that "a healthier thing, when things sell in six months rather than six days." Referring to the Wild West atmosphere of the first quarter of this year -- when bidding wars were common, and so were broken deals -- he said: "The quantum leap has happened; the catching-up from the recession has happened. My sense is we're going to enter a pretty stable market."
The brokers say the slowdown -- whether permanent or temporary -- is caused by several things, including the overpricing of apartments (and a dearth of good ones), a reluctance among banks to affirm the high prices with their appraisals and a nervousness among buyers about the stock market and the economic troubles in Asia.
Some contend that the main reason is a lack of appealing apartments in all price ranges.
"We had a great spring market -- many more listings than last year -- and everything got cleaned out," said Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the Corcoran Group. "And there is definitely buyer resistance. The high prices scare the hell out of people."
Neil Bader, chief executive of Skyscraper Mortgage, the city's largest mortgage brokerage company, said the residential real estate market was "stagnating" -- but not for lack of buyers, the usual reason for a summertime lull.
"We've got mortgage preapproval applications stacked up like cordwood on our desks," he said. "People are panting to buy something, but they say they can't find anything. They may have sold their own apartment, but they can't find something to buy."
It is a common complaint. Brokers interviewed this week said that many sellers, reacting to reports about the frenzy, have overpriced their apartments.
As Kay Brover, the sales director of Douglas Elliman's West Side office, explained it: "An apartment sells in a building for $750,000. The next apartment would normally come on for $775,000. But now the seller wants to price it for $895,000."
Even realistically priced condos and co-ops can linger, agents say. Apartments that a few months ago would have sold in a day or two, with multiple bids, have not yet been sold, or are being sold with normal bargaining. Ms. Brover said she also knew of several buyers who were backing out of deals. One who had already signed a contract forfeited his $175,000 down payment on a $1.75 million condominium on the West Side last week. Brokers blamed cold feet.
Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate, said his sales staff met Monday to discuss the current market.
"The agents seemed to be equally divided between those who believe the market is just taking a breath and those who say everywhere they go, the brokers are worrying that prices may have peaked," he said.
While some brokers said they would not have complete statistics until the end of June -- and others said they compiled them only by quarter -- Mr. Halstead said he keeps "elaborate records from the time there is an accepted offer on a property." And the number of accepted offers for the first two weeks of June was "about 10 percent off the same time last year." (He said bids were off more on the West Side than the East Side.)
Although Mr. Halstead described the slowdown as a hiccup, agents at his company said they had been advised to counsel sellers to reduce the prices of exclusive listings that don't sell within two weeks.
Most of the brokers interviewed also said that banks seem to have decided that the market is overheated and are therefore more reluctant to make loans. "The banks are tightening their belts," Ms. Corcoran wrote last week in a memo to her 300 agents.
Although an apartment at 222 Riverside Drive went to contract for $950,000, the bank's appraiser valued it at only $900,000, said Pam Tomlin, a Corcoran agent. The deal might have fallen through, she said, if the buyer hadn't agreed to cover half the purchase price with his own money.
Louise Fitting, another agent, said Chase Manhattan Bank had refused to give a mortgage for a $575,000 apartment in Trump Palace. Ms. Fitting said on Tuesday that her customers were applying to another bank.
Jeffrey Satkiewicz, an executive vice president of Mitchell, Maxwell & Jackson, the city's largest real estate appraiser, said that despite efforts to "give the banks four, five and six comparable sales -- rather than the standard three -- we're still getting twice as many of our appraisals kicked back by the banks for more justification than we did even a year ago."
Although neither the Douglas Elliman agency nor the Corcoran Group keeps statistics on accepted offers -- the first commitment by buyer and seller on a piece of real estate -- Corcoran produced statistics on the number of responses to advertisements that it placed in the Sunday Real Estate section of The New York Times. Although 35 percent more ads were placed during the first two weeks of June, 33 percent fewer people called about them than in June 1997.
"All these bidding wars have frightened not only the million-dollar investor but the studio and one-bedroom buyers, too," Ms. Corcoran said.
Like all the other brokers interviewed, she was quick to point out that the events that have made would-be buyers nervous -- things like bidding wars and the troubles in Asia -- have only slowed the market, not crippled it.
"We're still signing lots of contracts," she said, "so certainly not all of them are scared off. But there's no longer the fever pitch."
Dexter Guerrieri, president of Vandenberg Real Estate, a small Upper West Side company that specializes in town houses, said that his company's real estate advertisements "don't pull in as many customers" as they did in the spring and that the company "doesn't have as many buyers."
"But we're still making deals at full asking prices," he said, reeling off a handful of accepted offers. "I'm not a bit worried."

Research finds consumers worldwide belong to six basic groups that cross national lines.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
A VENERABLE research company is offering additional evidence that consumers around the world are more similar than different, sharing attitudes and behavior that advertisers and agencies may study to create more effective sales pitches.
The company, Roper Starch Worldwide in New York, has interviewed 35,000 consumers in 35 countries to identify shared values that cross national borders. The results of the study, "Global Consumer Hot Buttons," are to be presented today at a conference in midtown Manhattan marking the 75th anniversary of Roper Starch. 
 The study is indicative of concerted efforts to broaden consumer research beyond traditional considerations, be they demographic, psychographic or geographic.
"We are increasingly taking a more global view to consumer understanding, strategic planning and business management," said Larry Mock, vice president for market research worldwide at the Procter & Gamble Company in Cincinnati, who is scheduled to speak at the conference.
Examining consumers "at deeper, more emotional levels has allowed us to accelerate the rate at which we roll out our new product initiatives worldwide," he added.
Martha Farnsworth Riche, a consultant who until January was the Director of the Census Bureau, said certain factors once deemed crucial to understanding consumer behavior, particularly overseas, had become less important.
"People aren't all that different," said Ms. Riche, who is also scheduled to speak at the conference. "Their tastes are very similar. That's why it's worth Whirlpool's while to figure out what size refrigerators to make to sell in Korea."
"You've got to make sure that you don't use the taboo color, for instance," she added, "but the cultural stuff is just a wrinkle."
The purpose of the study, said Tom Miller, group senior vice president and director for international operations at Roper Starch, "was to put into place a globally comparable system of gathering consumer intelligence and predicting consumer trends around the world." Mr. Miller, who will present the study at the conference, offered a preview of the findings in an interview.
"We're looking for the bedrock values, the fundamental, stable things in people's lives that determine who they are," Mr. Miller said, "to understand the underlying motivations that drive their attitudes as well as their behavior."
The study, which covered countries in Asia, Europe and North and South America, found "six distinct global value groups," according to Mr. Miller, "belief systems that define consumers long term." As research companies are wont to do, Roper Starch has given the six categories catchy names that are meant to be remembered.
Here is a look at the groups, as described in the study.
STRIVERS -- The largest group, 23 percent of the world's adult population, hold "material things extremely important," Mr. Miller said, valuing "wealth, status, ambition and power" and products like computers and cellular telephones.
Strivers are "middle aged, more male than female," he added, "and found disproportionately in the developed and developing nations of Asia like Japan and the Philippines." They have little time for media apart from newspapers.
DEVOUTS -- Devouts, 22 percent of adults, have "more traditional values," Mr. Miller said, like "faith, duty, obedience, respect for elders," and are concentrated in Africa, Asia and the Mideast. They are least involved with the media and least likely to want Western brands.
ALTRUISTS -- As the name implies, Altruists, 18 percent of adults, are "very outer focused," Mr. Miller said, interested in social issues and causes. They are "generally well educated," he added, as well as older (median age of 44) and "more female than the norm." Altruists are often found in Latin America and Russia.
INTIMATES -- This group, at 15 percent of the adult population, is composed of "people people," Mr. Miller said, "focusing on relationships very close to home: spouses, significant others, family, colleagues, friends."
Intimates, frequently found in Britain, Hungary, the Netherlands and the United States, "are well worth targeting" if you are selling familiar consumer brands, he added.
They are "very heavy users of media that can be shared to create a common bond with other people," Mr. Miller said, like radio, movies and television. That helps explain the phenomenon of a "water cooler show" on TV, which people watch to discuss with others the next day.
FUN SEEKERS -- At 12 percent of adults and "the youngest group," Mr. Miller said, Fun Seekers prize values such as "pleasure, excitement, adventure and looking good." They frequent bars, clubs and restaurants and devour electronic media.
This is "the group that is more global in its life style," he added, "particularly in music." He said, "It really is an MTV generation."
CREATIVES -- The smallest group, at 10 percent, is dedicated to "learning, knowledge and technology," Mr. Miller said, and is "a global trendsetter in owning a PC, using a PC, surfing the Web."
Creatives "are the highest consumers of media" of any group, he added, "with a big skew toward books, magazines and newspapers."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
China's stable currency is protecting it, for now.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
BRIEFING reporters before President Clinton's touchdown in China, the Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, explained that the Chinese economy was "an island of stability" -- the only Asian power that was still growing, the only one whose currency had not taken a dive since the troubles swept the region last summer.
What he didn't explain is that China's economy is fundamentally in no better shape than, say, Indonesia's. Or that the primary reason the Chinese yuan hasn't budged is that currency markets lack the mechanism to topple it: unlike most Asian economies, China does not allow anyone to exchange its currency for dollars or yen without Government permission. 
 Does that mean the hordes of economists who counseled developing economies to adopt convertible currencies as quickly as possible were wrong? "Frankly," said C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, "the answer is 'yes.' "
With hindsight, it is easy enough to do a Dorian Gray-style analysis of the Asian economic miracle. Vast domestic savings and sheer hard work effectively masked the fragility and lack of sophistication of institutions that support modernization in a capitalist economy. As a result, Asia was able to grow rapidly through the 1980's and 1990's, even though far too much money went into grandiose, ill-advised investments and far too many banks and businesses took open-ended risks by borrowing heavily in foreign currency.
But the often-corrupt, top-down capitalism that weakened the economies of Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea and Indonesia describes China equally well. Indeed, Indonesia had a more solid institutional base on which to grow.
Indonesia's private banks, largely left alone by President Suharto's family and friends, flourished. Moreover, unlike China, Indonesia carried far less baggage in the form of inefficient state-owned industries with debts that could not possibly be repaid.
However, when currency panic spread from Thailand and Malaysia last fall, Indonesia proved extremely vulnerable. For one thing, it was easy to bet against the Indonesian rupiah because it had long been legal to exchange rupiah for other currencies. For another, Indonesian banks and industries owed billions of dollars to banks and bondholders that were callable on a few months' notice.
In China, by contrast, there was no easy way to make a currency bet in which you won if the yuan were devalued. To buy dollars with local currency requires permission from the Chinese central bank, which is not forthcoming unless it serves Government policy. Moreover, Chinese banks and corporations have very little short-term dollar debt because Beijing won't cooperate. Lenders won't lend dollars because they can't be repaid unless the Government agrees. Most foreign investments in China are thus in the form of equity in Chinese subsidiaries of foreign corporations or in long-term loans to Chinese corporations that are tied to machinery imports such as aircraft.
While hindsight has not been kind, there was method to the seeming madness of all those economists who pressed developing countries to allow free convertibility of currencies. Among other things, convertibility attracted foreign capital by reassuring investors that they could always repatriate their profits. It gave local importers and exporters a means of hedging their currency commitments. It reduced incentives for Government corruption.
But George Perry, an economist at the Brookings Institution, notes that the exceptionally high domestic savings rates in Asia (in contrast to Latin America) minimized the advantages of free convertibility. "What Asia needs is foreign technology and business organization, which comes with direct foreign investment, not dollar loans," he said.
While an inconvertible currency creates inefficiency since Government bureaucrats ultimately decide who has access to foreign cash, the cowboy capitalist ethic of financial markets in developing countries creates equally important inefficiencies. After all, private lenders in most of Asia were plainly out for the quick profits that came with borrowing in foreign currency -- and thus apt to ignore their exposure to currency fluctuations. With a convertible currency, "you're betting the farm on the vagaries of the international markets," said Jagdish Bhagwati, an economist at Columbia University.
China is not entirely immune to the Asian currency flu. As Beijing has publicly acknowledged in recent weeks, China will eventually feel compelled to devalue the yuan to insure that its exports remain competitive. But devaluation is probably months or years off, both because Hong Kong would be adversely affected and because China is enjoying the prestige derived from currency stability.
But the Chinese focus on stability is the exception in a global economy full of opportunistic borrowers and pathologically optimistic lenders. The best hope now, Mr. Perry suggests, is that "we will finally respond to the alarm bell that rang three years ago in the Mexican peso crisis." The movers and shakers of international finance, he argues, have to make clear that freely convertible currencies are accidents waiting to happen.

Why This Pampered Paradise? It's Oil, Stupid!

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: MALONGO, Angola

 BODY:
In this remote northern region of war-ravaged Angola, many of the accents are from the South -- Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana.
Here there are paved roads smooth enough to Rollerblade on. Folger's coffee seems to be percolating in every office. You can have hot dogs and chocolate chip cookies for lunch. Or play golf on the 18-hole par-3 course. 
 In the 20 years that civil war has raged across this once lush and prosperous former Portuguese colony -- leaving virtually every road cratered, every power plant destroyed, every manufacturing plant silent -- the oil rigs at Chevron's installation have just kept on pumping. The offshore horizon is a collection of spindly towers, some spouting bright orange gas flames.
The uninterrupted flow was made possible by one of the more bizarre twists of money and politics. At the height of the war, Chevron's installation was protected by Cuban troops who were supporting the Marxist Angolan Government in its struggle against a rebel onslaught.
At that time the United States was a staunch supporter of the rebels, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, known as Unita, the acronym for its name in Portuguese. But the Reagan Administration continued to allow Chevron to produce oil, about 50 percent of which went to Angola to pay for its war against Unita. Most of the oil was sold to America.
The Cubans are now gone. With the country in an uneasy bridge between war and peace, Angolan troops protect the area, which as part of Cabinda Province is cut off from the rest of Angola, and business is booming. The compound is a work in progress: expanded living quarters, a new dining hall, new office space and a new clinic are all under construction.
Angola is Africa's hottest oil territory right now. Recent offshore discoveries by Chevron and other international oil companies hold out the promise that Angola, which pumps about 740,000 barrels a day, may someday rival Nigeria's two million a day. Experts say this new-found wealth has the potential to speed Angola's recovery from its war.
Yet what troubles many diplomats and business executives is the habit the wealth has of disappearing. Angola's books have remained so opaque that the International Monetary Fund refuses to do business here. World Bank officials say that more than half of the Government's spending is on items not in the official budget. And while Luanda, the capital, has become a city with fancy sports cars and Paris couture imports, such luxuries remain the province of a tiny minority.
In Cabinda City, the nearest town to the Chevron compound, there are no signs of Paris, and few of public works. The roads quickly turn to dirt, and much of the housing is shacks. A public pool under construction when civil war broke out in 1966 remains unfinished and overgrown, only the diving board rising above tree line as a reminder of what might have been.
Here, as across the country, many civil servants are paid irregularly. And banditry by unfed soldiers is considered at least a part of the growing violence in rural areas.
Inside the compound, Chevron has built a bubble world. Its American employees work 12-hour days for 28 days straight, then jet back home for 28 days' rest. They are not allowed outside the fence, which is widely believed to be surrounded by land mines, although Chevron officials decline to talk about most security measures. Worried about their employees' safety, Chevron does not even let them drive the 12 miles between Malongo and the airport. They are taken by helicopter.
"Nobody just walks out the gate," said Larry Jostes, who is general manager here for 28 days, then goes home to San Francisco for 28 days of rest. "We know where everybody is all the time."
Many of the oil workers say their families know little about the country. Chuck Blevins, who runs a platform 30 miles out at sea, says he doubts that his wife or children back in Mississippi could find Angola on a map. Here the focus is on the huge machinery and engineering feats that keep the oil production up.
"It is a very exciting time to be here," said Don Nicholson, an electronic instrumentation specialist from Utah who has been working on one of the platforms for nine months. "We're at the cutting edge of the business."
Mr. Nicholson says he is curious nonetheless about what goes on in Angola and has attempted some Portuguese lessons, though without much success. "That Portuguese is just tearing me up," he said.
The oil companies have survived by remaining politically neutral and are not inclined to change that. Once the oil heads for the markets, they don't really worry about what happens to Angola's share of the profits.
But it is increasingly an issue for Angola, which has seen little social rehabilitation despite annual budgets of about $3.5 billion and 40 months of relative peace.
"Where has all the money gone?" has become a growing refrain here, even with members of Parliament. One recently lashed out at the Government, describing decrepit hospitals where 12 children a week die of malaria. Another said prisoners die of starvation in the country's jails.
Government officials have defended their reluctance to let anyone see the books by pointing out that they are still at war and do not want information about their financial strength to leak out. International creditors say some of the oil profits go straight into arms purchases, but corruption is widely assumed to siphon off much of the rest.
Meanwhile, the Government is driving harder and harder bargains for its oil. In the past, bidders merely submitted breakdowns of how eventual profits would be split. Now they must cough up "signing fees" that in the last 18 months amount to more than $200 million.
According to the London-based newsletter Africa Confidential, much of this new income remains inside the state oil company, Sonangol, and never makes it to the ministries of health and education that desperately need it.
Even if the money reached the treasury, Angola is probably unable to spend it wisely, experts say. For instance, since it is unable to get cheaper I.M.F. loans, Angola is paying huge foreign debts built up during the war at exorbitant interest rates.
Decades of war have left Angola with little expertise at investment management. But so much money is on the way that it will be impossible, some experts hope, for corrupt bureaucrats to steal it all.
"The magnitude of the resources," a diplomat said, "make it impossible for you to just quietly take the money away."

HEADLINE: Peruvian Premier Offers to Quit in Dispute Over Jailed American

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, June 24

 BODY:
Peru's Prime Minister of three weeks said today that he had offered to resign after President Alberto K. Fujimori rejected his idea to pardon a New Yorker imprisoned for life on terrorism charges. Mr. Fujimori declined the resignation offer.
The Prime Minister, Javier Valle Riestra, a 67-year-old lawyer and political independent, sparked a storm of Congressional protests when he suggested on Sunday that the 1996 military trial of Lori Helene Berenson, the New Yorker, was legally flawed and should be annulled. 
 On Tuesday, President Fujimori emphatically and swiftly rejected the suggestion that the 28-year-old former Manhattan resident be expelled to the United States.
"I find myself in a difficult emotional situation," Mr. Valle Riestra said in a radio interview today. "I live in a difficult situation because I can't be in continual and constant disagreement with majority opinion."
Since his surprise appointment to be coordinator of Mr. Fujimori's Cabinet only three weeks ago, Mr. Valle Riestra has made a series of statements opposing Government policy that have puzzled foreign diplomats and local journalists alike.
On his first day as Prime Minister, he said he opposed President Fujimori's expected bid for a third term in 2000. Soon after, Mr. Valle Riestra said he disagreed with the Government's plan to use military courts to try common criminals. And he has suggested that several Cabinet members be dismissed and replaced by human rights lawyers who have been critical of the President.
But it was his televised statement on Sunday that Ms. Berenson should be pardoned because of a lack of due process and "for reasons of state and for the sake of Peru's prestige" that isolated Mr. Valle Riestra from the entire Fujimori Administration and much of the political establishment. Newspaper editorials harshly criticized him, as did several prominent legislators.
Ms. Berenson has been held in a tiny cell high in the Andes since her conviction in January 1996 by a tribunal that did not allow her lawyers to question evidence or to cross-examine witnesses. She was accused of aiding the Marxist guerrilla group Tupac Amaru in a plan to take the Peruvian Congress hostage. Ms. Berenson said she was innocent but expressed sympathy for the rebels.
President Fujimori's choice of Mr. Valle Riestra came as a complete surprise. The constitutional lawyer and former Congressman had long been a member of the leftist APRA party and an advocate of human rights. But with Mr. Fujimori's standing in the polls falling, the economy jeopardized by the Asian economic crisis, and sensitive negotiations with Ecuador over a border dispute entering a crucial stage, several experts said the President was looking to broaden his base and improve his image by naming a liberal to be Prime Minister.
This morning, Mr. Valle Riestra sounded tired and frustrated, as if acknowledging that his efforts to push reforms in the Fujimori Administration had failed. But by an afternoon news conference, he sounded defiant again, as if President Fujimori's refusal to accept his resignation signified a victory.
"I will continue in this struggle, even when I oppose the chief of state," he told reporters, shaking his fist. "All the repressive acts of this Government must be opposed, and that is what I will continue to do."

HEADLINE: U.S. to Release Patent Data On a World Wide Web Site

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
In a new plan for making Government information freely available over the Internet, the Clinton Administration will announce today that it will make the full data base of the nation's patents since 1976 and trademark text and images starting from the late 1800's available on the World Wide Web beginning in August.
The project, which will create the largest Government data base on the Internet, is to be announced by Bruce A. Lehman, Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, in a speech to the American Bar Association's section on intellectual property law in Williamsburg, Va. 
 The decision to make the data base freely available is a result of a fierce debate that has gone on for years between public interest advocates who argue that Government information should routinely be made available on the Internet and companies that purchase the data from Government agencies to resell.
Indeed, the Clinton Administration's action came less than a week before a deadline imposed by Carl Malamud, an independent Internet pioneer, who in May said he planned to purchase the data from the Patent and Trademark Office and make it publicly available if the Government failed to act.
After imposing the deadline in a letter to Vice President Al Gore Jr. and the Commerce Secretary, William M. Daley, Mr. Malamud said that he had received an anonymous donation to support his project and that he was developing his own system of patent and trademark records.
Mr. Lehman, however, said that his agency had already made a commitment to Mr. Gore to make the data base available as part of the Vice President's "reinventing government" program.
Mr. Malamud said today that he had decided to shelve his plans.
"Our site was a backup in case the Administration refused to budge," he said. "We very pleased with the outcome of this five-year struggle. The American public gets the data they deserve, and the Clinton Administration has shown real responsiveness by reversing its earlier policy."
In January 1994, Mr. Malamud's group, the nonprofit Internet Multicasting Service, posted the full text of filings made by corporations to the Securities and Exchange Commission and several years of the patent data base over the objections of the S.E.C. and the Patent and Trademark Office. His organization later added data bases from the General Services Administration, the Federal Election Commission, the Federal Reserve Board and the Government Printing Office.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Lehman said that it had long been his intention to make both data bases available on the Internet but that he needed first to meet a range of technical and policy criteria.
"Creating a 1.3-terabyte searchable data base is a big technical feat," he said. A terabyte is one trillion characters of information, equivalent to about a million copies of "Moby Dick."
First, he said, such a system requires tight security provisions to isolate it from the Patent and Trademark Office's internal computer network. In addition, he said, his agency had to perform an economic analysis on how the decision would affect both the Patent and Trademark Office and the information industry.
"We have no interest in competing with the private sector," he said, adding that his agency's analysis had shown that the private-sector offers added value beyond the patent and trademark documents.
The new data bases will be available at the Patent and Trademark Office's Web site beginning in August, when trademark text will go on line. Trademark images and patent text will follow in November. Patent images linked to the text of the patents will be made available by March 1999, he said.
The data base of more than two million patents will be searchable by key word, as will more than 800,000 registered trademarks and 300,000 pending trademarks. The entire data base will be made up of 21 million documents.
Currently the Patent and Trademark Office makes abstracts of patents available, a system that is already providing users with more than three million pages of patent material a month.
The Patent and Trademark Office received 237,045 patent applications in the most recent fiscal year -- a 14.9 percent annual increase -- and approved about 114,000 patents. Trademark applications grew by 11.8 percent, to 224,355.
The new data base on the World Wide Web is a significant step forward, Mr. Lehman said, adding that his plan calls for completely automating the nation's patent system by 2003.

Japan's 'Mr. Yen' Will Keep His Post

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 24

 BODY:
Japan's top financial diplomat, Eisuke Sakakibara -- known in some circles as "Mr. Yen" for his ability to sway the currency markets -- has retained his post as Vice Finance Minister for international affairs for another year, the ministry said today.
Speculation had increased lately that Mr. Sakakibara would be replaced in this month's annual Finance Ministry personnel shuffle, but that was before the joint Japanese-American currency intervention last week, in which he played a key role. The intervention at one point strengthened the battered yen by nearly 10 to the dollar. It has since resumed its decline, settling in New York today at 141.25 to the dollar. 
 Mr. Sakakibara had come under criticism from ruling-party and opposition politicians, and even from his boss, Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga, for outspokenness. He was assailed by some in the ruling party for orchestrating a $20 billion Japanese effort in April to prop up the yen, which proved largely ineffective.
Traders said today that Japan needed Mr. Sakakibara to stay in his post at a time of such volatility in the currency.

Treasuries Lose Early Gains As Note Auction Falls Short

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities lost early gains and ended mixed yesterday, reflecting some disappointment over the results of a Government debt auction and uncertainty about Japanese financial plans.
Traders said market participants were concerned about any further rise in the dollar because that might provoke more central bank intervention to support the yen, as when the United States and Japan bought yen last week and sent the dollar down sharply. The dollar has since retraced much of the loss. 
 The 30-year bond slipped 8/32, to a price of 106 22/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.66 percent, from 5.64 percent on Tuesday.
In early dealings, Treasuries followed the dollar fairly closely, as the United States currency initially gained strength against the yen, retreated on rumors of Japanese central bank intervention and rebounded on skepticism about Japan's ability to solve its financial problems.
Bonds also derived some early strength from the Government's monthly report yesterday on production of long-lasting goods, which showed a sharp decline in May. The report suggested that the crisis in Asia was slowing economic growth, which tends to help the bond market because it diminishes the possibility of higher inflation.
But bonds began to weaken after the Treasury's $11 billion five-year note auction was seen as a little below average, with the notes awarded at a price to yield 5.454 percent, less than the 5.47 percent dealers had anticipated. The results suggested softer demand than expected for new Treasury debt.

Telecommuncations Issues Send the Dow Up by 95.41

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The stock market rose sharply yesterday on the strength of demand for shares in telecommunications equipment makers and cable companies after the AT&T Corporation agreed to buy Tele-Communications Inc.
The transaction raised expectations that the demand for such equipment will surge in the consolidation of the telecommunications industry. 
 "Telephone, Internet and broadband services will be through bigger 'pipes' that TCI is rolling out," said John Golden, an analyst for telecommunications and computer-related stocks at John Hancock Funds, which oversees about $35 billion. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 95.41 points, or 1.1 percent, to 8,923.87, bringing its gain since Monday to 212 points.
The increase came even as AT&T, one of the 30 Dow stocks, dropped 5 3/8, to 60, its biggest loss since Oct. 27, after warning that the TCI acquisition will hurt its earnings for three years.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 13.39, or 1.2 percent, to a record 1,132.88. The Nasdaq composite index, loaded with telecommunications equipment stocks, rose 33.19, or 1.8 percent, to 1,877.76.
Volume on the Big Board totaled 715 million shares, above the three-month daily average of 607 million.
TCI rose 1 1/16, to 39 3/4, in trading of almost 45 million shares, making it the most active issue on United States exchanges.
Other cable stocks also rallied. The Cablevision Systems Corporation jumped 14, to 76; Time Warner Inc. rose 5 1/8, to 88, and Adelphia Communications Corporation gained 4, to 33 3/4.
Among telecommunications equipment makers, ADC Telecommunications rose 3, to 35 5/8; Scientific-Atlanta Inc. rose 2 1/8, to 24 1/16; Tellabs Inc. gained 4, to 73 3/8, and the General Instrument Corporation, a maker of digital cable boxes, jumped 2 15/16, to 26 1/8. Northern Telecom rose 2 5/16, to 56 1/16. Lucent rose 1 5/8, to 80 1/8.
"You're seeing a convergence among a number of industries as everybody competes to be the full-service providers to the consumer -- long distance, local, cellular and data," said Rick White, who manages $2.5 billion for Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc. in New York.
As companies broaden their offerings, he added, "they're engaging in an arms war, where the telecom equipment makers are the guys that are peddling the arms."
All the regional Bells fell on the prospect of AT&T's assault on their local telephone market via TCI's cable lines. Bell Atlantic Corporation dropped 5 7/8, to 92 1/2; SBC Communications Inc. fell 1 1/2, to 39 3/4; the Ameritech Corporation lost 2 3/8, to 42 1/2; the BellSouth Corporation fell 2 1/2, to 67, and U S West Inc. dropped 1 5/8, to 48 11/16.
The Microsoft Corporation rallied for a ninth day, bringing its gain for that period to 23 percent. The No. 1 maker of personal computer software, which won an important appeals court ruling Tuesday in the Government's antitrust case, brings out its Windows 98 operating system today. Shares rose 4 3/16, to a record 104 15/16.

HEADLINE: G.M. Calls Strikes Illegal and Threatens Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., June 24

 BODY:
General Motors said today that two strikes in Michigan that have crippled its car and truck production were illegal, taking an unusually hard stance against its national union over local walkouts.
The company said in a statement that it would seek to take the United Automobile Workers to expedited arbitration and wanted a response from the union within 48 hours. The company also plans to block payments of unemployment benefits to idled workers. G.M. tried a similar tactic in a 1996 strike in Dayton, Ohio, but almost all states granted unemployment benefits. 
 "We should not have to support a strike against ourselves," said Gerald A. Knechtel, vice president of G.M. in charge of personnel for the company's North American operations. "We will vigorously pursue this action in all of the states in which we have affected operations."
The company's latest stance was communicated in a letter to Richard Shoemaker, the union's point man in negotiations with G.M., and was disclosed as U.A.W. leaders at a convention here continued to forecast a long summer of heated labor battles with the company.
Mr. Shoemaker said today that the letter accused union negotiators of thwarting management efforts to settle the local issues that set off strikes by 9,200 workers at two factories in Flint, Mich., and also accused them of essentially waging a national strike. The strikes have idled more than 140,000 workers.
Mr. Shoemaker dismissed the letter's accusations as "theatrics."
"Steve and I met with Jack Smith and other G.M. executives," he said in an interview. "If their charges were valid, that would have been the time to bring them up, not while we're trying to have serious negotiations. Someday they're going to have to start taking this strike seriously and begin to work toward a solution instead of wasting time twisting perception."
The U.A.W. has maintained that its members are on a strike because of hundreds of health and safety grievances, including hazardous leaking fluids and dangerous noise levels, issues that U.A.W. locals are allowed to strike over. But many striking workers have openly focused their anger at a series of broken commitments concerning investment at the plants. The two sides will have to meet with an arbitrator before going before a judge.
Mr. Shoemaker said he saw little chance that the letter would end the work stoppage or deter future strikes by union locals in Dayton, Indianapolis and at a Flint car factory scheduled to be closed next year. A strike at the brake factories in Dayton alone would cripple G.M., just as one did for 17 days in 1996. And all the local skirmishes could ignite an even larger showdown during next year's national contract talks with G.M.
In his statement, Mr. Knechtel of G.M. said, "Our contention is that the strikeable issues identified by the union are contrived and that the real issues that led to these costly disputes are ones that the unions have agreed to be nonstrikeable issues."
Frank W. Buck, a Cleveland lawyer who represents the management of many auto parts companies during labor disputes, said that G.M. could seek a court injunction demanding that the union return to work or even ask that the U.A.W. cover G.M.'s losses during the strike, which analysts estimate at close to $1 billion. "It's pressure General Motors can bring to bear," he said. But Federal laws limit when courts can intervene in labor disputes, making it likely that G.M.'s latest action is aimed mainly at forcing a settlement with the union.
Dale Brickner, professor emeritus of labor and industrial relations at Michigan State University, views the legal fight as a risky strategy for both sides. He said G.M. would have to explain why it was challenging the Flint strikes as a national dispute while it did not do so in more than a dozen similar local strikes over the last three years. The union, meanwhile, would have to prove that its fight was truly based on health and safety issues at the striking plants.
G.M.'s latest action was largely overshadowed here today by the re- election of Stephen P. Yokich to his second and final term as president of the 61-year-old union. Mr. Yokich did not even comment on the letter, though people close to him say it has intensified the union's resolve not to capitulate to G.M., which employs 220,000 of its 750,000 members.
Clearly, the 62-year-old Mr. Yokich has more important issues to deal with regarding the union's future. He wants to be known as the president who expanded the union's power base outside the nation's Big Three auto makers. The U.A.W. has been under pressure for decades to stem a precipitous decline in membership, which has dropped from a peak of 1.5 million in 1979, and to bring small parts shops and foreign auto giants such as Honda, Toyota and Nissan into the U.A.W. fold.
As for G.M., Mr. Yokich has largely left the tedious negotiations to Mr. Shoemaker, a savvy negotiator who has drafted some of the union's most complex agreements. He said further labor strife with G.M. was almost assured because the auto maker was in such a race to expand its global presence that it was disregarding input from workers and overlooking the long-term effects of breaking investment commitments in the United States.
"Globalization is a fact of life, and we recognize that General Motors just like every other auto maker has to be a player in that worldwide market," Mr. Shoemaker said. "But that doesn't mean G.M. can forget the agreements it's made here in America with local unions. If we can't convince them to address these issues in a rational and honest manner, then these kinds of confrontations will continue."

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE AGENDAS -- U.S. Needs Something to Show for Its Policy, While China Wants Some Respect;
For Beijing, the Primary Need Is Recognition as a Major Player

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 24

 BODY:
China would love President Clinton to announce here this week that Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province, will get no more American weapons, that China's application to join the World Trade Organization is near approval and that the economic and military sanctions the United States imposed after the 1989 crackdown on student-led demonstration in Tiananmen Square will be lifted.
In truth, as the leaders here already know, China will get few if any of the policy changes it wants during the state visit that begins on Thursday. 
 And yet, China's leaders and people are ecstatic about the visit, the first by an American President in nine years and one that is already being hailed here as a great step forward in diplomatic relations.
This summit meeting is important to China for both symbolic and practical reasons. Symbolic, because the Chinese clearly feel that, by his very presence, Mr. Clinton, leader of the world's No. 1 economic and military power, will confer new status on China as a major international player.
Practical, because China's leaders are convinced that friendly ties with the United States are crucial to their ambitious goal of creating a more market-oriented and prosperous economy.
What China seeks most right now, one senses here, is not so much the things that get discussed at meetings, like trade or security or even a cave-in on Taiwan. It is, in a word, respect.
The Chinese wear their country's painful history on their sleeves and invariably bring it up in discussions of foreign policy. After the humiliating foreign incursions of the 19th and early 20th century, decades of terrible civil war and then the destructive chaos of Mao's political campaigns, culminating in the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, China feels it is finally on its feet. Its economy has surged, its leadership is stable and China is more than ready to take what it believes to be its rightful place.
"This visit means that China finally has been noticed by the world," said Xiong Zhiyong, dean of the Foreign Affairs College in Beijing. "The American Administration is recognizing the importance of China."
This is also the first visit by an American President since 1989, and the leaders here hope that it will mark, if not an end to world disapproval of that year's massacre of hundreds of civilians around Tiananmen Square, at least tacit agreement to push the lingering ghosts to the side.
For President Jiang Zemin personally, to again stand beside the American President, following his touted tour of America last year, may cement his stature as a statesman able to take up where the late Deng Xiaoping left off.
At a more practical level, friendly ties with the United States are seen as vital to Beijing's domestic aims.
"The paramount goal of China is to modernize, and to do that we need a durable, peaceful environment," said Yan Xuetong, a foreign policy expert at the Chinese Institute of Contemporary International Relations. "If we get on bad terms with the United States, we'll never get the right environment."
China has embarked on two major, precarious transitions, said Jia Qingguo, a professor of international studies at Beijing University: a shift in politics from personal, charismatic leadership toward more bureaucratic and technocratic rule and a shift in the economy from rigid socialism toward a market economy.
"We need stability to carry out these reforms," Mr. Jia said. "And we need all the support we can get to help China through this difficult period."
Many Chinese scholars said that while the outside pressures and criticisms that come with deeper contacts will be controversial here, China badly needs more foreign trade, more foreign investment, more advanced technologies as well as more cooperation in developing energy sources, fighting air and water pollution and other technical areas. For all these things, leaders here believe, the United States is the primary source.
China, though its military power is growing, wants to avoid costly confrontations in Asia. It has an almost willful naivete about the fear its rising military capability inspires among its neighbors. China, despite its past support for Pakistan, is working with the United States to contain a nuclear arms race in South Asia and peacefully resolve tensions on the Korean peninsula. It is also wary of the recently affirmed Japanese-United States security alliance and suggestions that even Japan could support the defense of Taiwan in a crisis.
Taiwan, as officials here never tire of saying, remains the "core issue" in Chinese-American relations. There seems little doubt here that in the event of a serious step toward independence by Taiwan, China would risk all its gains by resorting to military force if necessary, possibly forcing America's hand in turn.
But many Chinese foreign policy experts also recognize that Mr. Clinton has little political space to maneuver on Taiwan. So long as he strongly reiterates American support for "one China," the Chinese leaders seem ready to let the matter ride for now, though they maintain the right to use force and harshly criticize American sales of advanced weapons to Taiwan. They also know that closer Chinese-American ties implicitly pressure Taiwan to tread carefully in any moves toward formal independence.
The post-1989 sanctions barring American government export loans and restricting exports of arms and certain high-technology items, such as satellites and advanced computers, definitely rankle Chinese pride and they also impede the high-priority quest for superior technology.
Still, recent comments by Chinese officials on the sanctions have sounded more resigned than angry.
On Monday, the Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, Shi Guangsheng, was asked whether a case-by-case rather than general easing of sanctions would do. "China welcomes any action that will result in the relaxation of export restrictions," he said.
Acceptance into the World Trade Organization, in which all the Western countries and Japan as well as many developing countries set trade rules, has been a prime political and economic goal. .
For now, the Chinese leaders have swallowed their pride as American negotiators declared that the country is far from satisfying requirements for access to China's markets. On Monday, Mr. Shi, instead of lashing out, noted that "we don't have any timetable," and expressed the hope of further progress this week.
Because the Clinton visit, and more generally ties with the United States, have been invested with so much meaning here, some Chinese who know both countries well fear that dangerously unrealistic expectations are being created, with the potential to create a backlash.
A leading Chinese specialist in American affairs, who spoke on condition of anonymity, worried that China underestimates the force and staying power of issues like human rights or the concerns in Washington about transfer of sensitive technologies and possible illegal political donations.
"The most disastrous misperception of the United States is that Americans are purely pragmatic, practical people who only care for money, and don't have strong inner political and spiritual values," the scholar said.
If the two countries can weave mutually advantageous strategic and economic ties, the scholar said many Chinese mistakenly think, then irritating American concerns like human rights or the status of Tibet will recede.
Suisheng Zhao, a Chinese-born political expert at Colby College in Maine, who recently visited Beijing, expressed concern that the Chinese are reading too much into the American relationship -- some businessmen even predict it will boost China's stock market -- and will be in for a rude surprise once things turn sour.
"The weight of this summit is very different on the two sides of the Pacific," Mr. Zhao said.
But Mr. Xiong, the dean of the Foreign Affairs College, felt a more realistic view was spreading -- that more Chinese realize that relations between major powers will have ups and downs, that countries are not all friend or enemy. "We know it won't always go smoothly," he said.

HEADLINE: COMMUNICATIONS GIANT: THE SHAREHOLDERS -- A Hitch in the AT&T-TCI Hitch;
For Shareholders, a New Type of Stock to Behold

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Widows and orphans, hold onto your hats.
As part of the merger between AT&T and Tele-Communications Inc., millions of AT&T shareholders, many of them individual investors who own the stock for its relative safety and high dividend yield, are about to become holders of one of Wall Street's sexiest and most complex inventions, so-called tracking stock. 
 True, AT&T's stock -- which was divided into long-distance and local operating companies in the 1984 breakup and then split three ways more than two years ago to create separate equipment, phone and computer companies -- is no longer held mostly by the proverbial widows and orphans of old. But its shareholders, even the most sophisticated among them, will be puzzling over this latest deal for a while.
What is a tracking stock? It is a security typically issued by a large conglomerate with interests in a wide variety of businesses. Because the security is designed to track a narrow segment of the company's far-flung operations, issuing it is a good way for a company to put a discrete market value on those operations alone. The stocks are likewise bought by investors interested in whatever aspect of the business the stock tracks.
There is a big difference between common stocks and tracking stocks, however. In most cases, ownership of tracking shares does not represent direct ownership of the business's underlying assets, as common stock ownership does. The underlying assets are still owned by the issuing company, but in a tracking stock the issuing company agrees to parcel out the economics of the business, as it were, giving its shareholders a stake in the entire operation while its tracking stockholders can concentrate their bet.
Although tracking stocks have been around for about 15 years, only about 15 companies in the United States have issued them. These companies range from household names such as General Motors, USX and Georgia-Pacific to smaller companies like Seagull Energy, the electronics retailer Circuit City and the Genzyme Corporation, a biotechnology concern.
Why is staid AT&T going the tracking stock route? The heads of both companies are big believers in the concept. John C. Malone, chairman of TCI, has a tracking stock, called Liberty Media Group, that represents the performance of the company's cable programming. And C. Michael Armstrong, AT&T's chief executive, came from G.M.'s Hughes Electronics division and is comfortable with the idea.
By issuing a tracking stock, AT&T can accomplish objectives generally achieved in a corporate spinoff without incurring any of the negatives, such as having to meet some fairly stringent tax law requirements. To make a spinoff tax-free to shareholders, for instance, the parent company would be prohibited by the Internal Revenue Service from having dealings with the new company once a spinoff had taken place. But the company also gives up some of the advantages of a clean spinoff, which means investors are not likely to place as much value on the tracking stock as they would on a new spinoff owning the same assets.
"People recognize that a tracking stock is not the same as outright ownership, so they do trade at some discount" to what they would have fetched in a spinoff, said Robert Willens, a tax and accounting analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York.
Still, the company gains a lot from issuing a tracking stock. Once a company has issued one, it can count on being able to raise capital at the higher valuations that it expects investors to assign to that particular aspect of the company's business. It can use that money for either acquisitions or capital investments in the operation.
General Motors, for example, was the first company to float a tracking stock. It issued two, one to cover its now-divested Electronic Data Systems subsidiary (so-called "E" shares) and another ("H" shares) to track its Hughes Electronics division. Both were higher-growth businesses than G.M.'s more predominant automotive operations, and so investors were more eager to own them. G.M.'s "H" stock, for example, now trades at around 36 times what Hughes Electronics earned over the last 12 months, while G.M. trades at a price/earnings multiple of 8.
Under the terms of the AT&T merger, the company will offer 0.7757 share of its common stock for each share of TCI Group series A and 0.8533 share of AT&T for each share of TCI's series B stock. AT&T expects to issue 440 million shares in the transaction. The existing TCI tracking stock, in a modified form, will be reissued by AT&T and therefore will remain as a separate, publicly traded security after the merger. Mr. Malone holds a controlling interest in Liberty Media Group.
Although AT&T will acquire title to Liberty Media Group in the deal, it has agreed to pass along all the benefits of ownership to the holders of the tracking stock. If Liberty Media Group were to be sold, for example, all the proceeds would go to its tracking shareholders, none to AT&T. Shareholders of AT&T will not receive shares of Liberty Media Group as part of the merger.
But AT&T didn't stop there. The company will also issue a new tracking stock of its own in the merger. This stock will represent the activities of AT&T Consumer Services, a new subsidiary that will result from the merger. The subsidiary will include AT&T's interests in residential long-distance, wireless and Internet services and TCI's cable and telecommunications businesses. The company expects AT&T Consumer Services to have revenue in 1999 of $33 billion and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of around $7 billion.
Not included in the new AT&T tracking stock will be the products and services AT&T offers to business customers, including Internet access, long-distance and wireless services and high-speed data offerings. These operations are expected to generate revenue in 1999 of at least $29 billion and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $12 billion.
Those who own AT&T common stock will have a claim on both AT&T's business and consumer operations, while the tracking stockholders will trade exclusively in a piece of paper focused on the consumer side of the business. Also excluded from the tracking stock will be the assets of the AT&T network and AT&T's wholesale business, in which the company generates revenue of about $2 billion selling long-distance time on its lines in bulk.
All this makes for one complicated deal. Indeed, confusion surrounding the merger may have contributed to the 8 percent decline in AT&T stock yesterday. Tepid action in TCI Group's shares, up $1.0625, to $39.75, also seemed to indicate investor confusion and doubt about whether or not the deal will go through.
The merger poses two major risks that may contribute to the doubt. One is that Federal regulators will not approve it. Another is that TCI's chairman, Mr. Malone, will change his mind and walk away from the proposed merger as he did five years ago when Bell Atlantic offered almost $17 billion for TCI.
Are tracking stocks riskier than investing in the parent company? Only in the sense that their lack of diversification makes a bet that much more narrowly placed. For example, CMS Energy Group, a gas and electric utility and energy concern in Dearborn, Mich., has a tracking stock, CPG, that reflects the performance of its gas distribution subsidiary. If gas prices plunged, the tracking shares would probably be hurt more than the shares of the more diversified parent.
What about the fact that tracking stocks have no assets underlying them? This has not presented a problem to shareholders because none of the companies that have issued these shares have experienced financial problems.
When can AT&T shareholders expect to get their new tracking shares? That is unclear. According to Mr. Willens, the tax and accounting analyst, tracking stocks are typically issued to shareholders either in the form of a stock dividend alone or combined with an initial public offering of the subsidiary's shares.
Eileen Connolly, an AT&T spokeswoman, said the company had not decided how it would get the Consumer Services tracking stock into investors' hands. "We have said that a portion will be held by the public," she said, "but we have not said how that will be achieved."

AT&T will gain a substantial toehold in the cable industry with the acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc., giving it access to 10.5 million homes. TCI, which consists of three divisions that trade as separate stocks, gets a benefactor with deep pockets to pay for expansion.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE AGENDAS -- U.S. Needs Something to Show for Its Policy, While China Wants Some Respect;
Clinton Needs Ways to Allay Unease in U.S. About Beijing

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: XIAN, China, Thursday, June 25

 BODY:
President Clinton's aerial caravan arrives here today for a visit eagerly sought by his Chinese hosts as long-overdue recognition of China's status as a major global power. But Mr. Clinton leaves behind an America deeply uneasy about the conduct and intentions of a rising China.
In the days leading up to the summit talks, the friction in the relationship has been evident in the two countries' failure to reach agreement on a number of agenda items the United States considers important, including human rights, trade, military cooperation, and a largely symbolic gesture to announce that neither country would aim its nuclear missiles at the other. 
 Aware of these problems, the White House has been trying to make the case that the success of the visit ought to be measured not in the number of agreements reached or documents signed -- they will be relatively few and modest -- but in whether Mr. Clinton and President Jiang Zemin can subtly redefine the relationship between the two nations.
Mr. Clinton's nine-day voyage to China is the longest Presidential visit to a single country since Harry S. Truman attended the Potsdam peace conference in Germany after the end of World War II in Europe. It is the first to China since President Bush was here in 1989.
The President intends to devote the majority of his schedule and his public appearances to addressing China's people, not its leaders. He will visit a small village that has conducted its first open election, attend services at an officially registered Protestant church in Beijing, speak to students at Beijing University, and engage in a round-table discussion with young entrepreneurs in Shanghai. The official part of his schedule is essentially limited to a half day of meetings with Mr. Jiang and two elaborate dinners.
The hope, the President and his advisers say, is to show the American people a dynamic and diverse China that could become the American economy's biggest customer and an important ally in the 21st century.
The message is simple: China is too big to be ignored and the United States-China relationship too important to fail.
"That relationship," Mr. Clinton said in an address 10 days ago outlining the goals for his trip, "will in large measure help to determine whether the new century is one of security, peace and prosperity for the American people."
The President's schedule is also an answer to critics in Congress and elsewhere, who object to the warming of relations with a Government that still jails dissidents, threatens Taiwan, oppresses Tibet, forces abortions and imposes stiff tariffs on American goods and services.
The political goal of the President's journey, as formed by White House strategists, can best be understood as a long defense of his policy of engaging China, which is the focus of investigations on Capitol Hill into political contributions and the possible transfer of American technology to the development of Chinese nuclear missiles.
Thus the visit will be heavily symbolic, beginning with his arrival in Xian, the ancient Chinese capital.
The official welcoming ceremony will be held Saturday morning in Tiananmen Square, a place where the Chinese have celebrated triumph and witnessed tragedy repeatedly over the decades since the Communist revolution of 1949. Mr. Clinton has already come under criticism in the United States for agreeing to appear at the square, the symbol of the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in 1989.
The trip ends in Hong Kong, which Mr. Clinton will portray as the hoped-for future of all China.
The images Mr. Clinton wants his domestic American audience to remember are his contacts with ordinary Chinese -- villagers, students, business people, first-time homeowners, churchgoers.
As Mr. Clinton makes his progress from historic Xian to imperial Beijing to bustling Shanghai to picturesqe Guilin, he will be following the standard tourist itinerary. Each stop has a policy component, but it the risk for the White House is that Americans will see only the pictures and find few concrete benefits to the United States.
"This is a highly risky summit for the President," said David Shambaugh, director of the Sigur Center at George Washington University and a former China policy adviser at the National Security Council and the State Department. "It's the longest trip of his Presidency and he is spending most of it sightseeing."
The White House has tried to win Chinese concessions in some important areas as part of the President's visit. But senior officials said Mr. Clinton left for China with little prospect of agreement on major parts of that agenda.
The White House had hoped that China would sign the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, as Beijing promised to do this spring, when Mr. Clinton chose not to sponsor a resolution condemning China's human rights practices. But President Jiang announced that China would only sign the convention this autumn.
China also has thus far rejected American efforts on Tibet, by refusing the idea of a visit, by an internationally known person or organization, to the young Panchen Lama designated by the Dalai Lama. China has appointed its own Panchen Lama, the second-ranking spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists. According to Beijing, the 9-year-old boy who was named by the Dalai Lama and his parents are under the state's protection in an unnamed location.
China has also resisted American requests to stop the re-education of monks and nuns in Tibetan monasteries, and has thus far not released any well-known Tibetan prisoners of conscience. Nor has China yet released any of the dissidents on list given to Beijing by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
China has also rejected the idea of any sweeping review of the cases of nearly 2,500 prisoners convicted under a counter-revolutionary offense now scrapped from Chinese law, including some dating from the Tiananmen demonstrations.
And officials in Washington were pessimistic about the possibility of an agreement under which China would stop aiming its nuclear missiles at the United States.
Officially, the White House said there was still hope for the gesture and sent the deputy national security adviser, James B. Steinberg, to China ahead of Mr. Clinton for a last round of talks.
But State Department and Pentagon officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was unlikely a deal could be reached. China has insisted it would not "detarget" its missiles until the United States pledged not to use nuclear weapons first in a crisis. "We're absolutely deadlocked," one official said.
Against this political backdrop, Mr. Clinton hopes to assuage domestic critics of engagement with the Chinese with frank talk on China's continuing human rights abuses. He will remind China's leaders that attempts to meddle in American politics by secret campaign contributions are illegal and unacceptable. He will praise China for its role in trying to restrain an arms race between India and Pakistan, and press it not to sell missiles to Pakistan. He will urge it to open its markets.
Also on the agenda is the Asian financial crisis, and Mr. Clinton will thank China for not devaluing its currency, a step which might lead to other devaluations and worse financial problems in Asia.
On many of these points the President has come under attack from critics across the political spectrum in the United States, who complain that he is turning a blind eye to Chinese misbehavior in the interest of advancing commercial ties to the world's most populous nation.
"What is his real policy? Engaging them by money?" asked Harry Wu, a Chinese dissident now living in the United States. "Only in giving them money, it means an appeasement policy. If your policy, foreign policy, doesn't contain a moral basis, this is a typical, hypocritical appeasement policy."

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Orders Retreated by 2.6% in May

BYLINE: Bridge News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
Orders to United States factories for big-ticket durable goods fell sharply in May as Asia's economic crisis helped to depress orders for transportation- and electronics-related goods.
The Commerce Department reported today that total orders for durable goods fell by 2.6 percent, to $184.305 billion in May, the largest decline in five months. The May decline followed a revised 1.6 percent rise in April, originally reported as a 2.2 percent gain. 
 Economists said that the drop in May durable orders, which was far worse than the seven-tenths of a percent decline expected by economists, confirms that the nation's economy will slow substantially in the second quarter after the very rapid 4.8 percent growth rate in the first quarter.
Weaker exports to Asia combined with an effort by United States businesses to work off excess inventories mean that American manufacturers are seeing fewer orders, economists said.
Kevin Logan, senior economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in New York, said the decline in durable orders in May is "one more piece of evidence that fits with the picture of weakening demand in the manufacturing sector."
The Commerce Department said that the fall in durable orders in May was led by a 3.5 percent plunge in transportation orders. New orders for civilian aircraft, a significant swing factor for durables orders each month, fell 13.3 percent in May, the department said.
In other key categories, new orders for electronic and other electrical equipment fell 6.8 percent in May, the largest decline since September 1997.
Even stripping out the volatile transportation sector, durable goods orders still fell by a sharp 2.3 percent in May, the department said.
"The decline was across the board," said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at the Canadian investment firm Nesbitt Burns, a unit of Bank of Montreal. "It certainly was the weakest report so far this year."
Ms. Cooper said the durable goods report suggested that overall growth in the nation's economy could slow to around 2 percent in the second quarter, less than half the first-quarter pace.

HEADLINE: Saks 5th Ave. Is Said to Be Up for Sale

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Saks Fifth Avenue, one of New York's oldest and most esteemed names in retailing, is on the selling block, executives who have been briefed on the effort said yesterday.
The majority owner of the 97-store Saks, Investcorp International, a Bahrain-based investment bank, has richly profited from investing in other luxury retailers like Tiffany and Gucci and selling them. The company has been seeking a similar way to profit from Saks. 
 Retailers tend to fetch one to one and a half times revenue, which would mean Saks could be priced at between $2 billion and $2.5 billion.
Saks was bought by Investcorp in 1990 for $1.6 billion, and the company sold 20 percent of Saks to the public in 1995 for $25 a share, or $425 million. Although the stock soared in its early days of trading, it has since failed to post the kinds of returns that Investcorp enjoyed with Tiffany & Company and the Gucci Group rewarded Investcorp with. Yesterday, shares of Saks closed at $24.8125, down 43.75 cents.
Investcorp has a longstanding practice of acquiring companies, providing capital and other resources for growth and then selling them in the public marketplace or to private investors. But the decision to sell Saks was initiated by the retailer's board, the executives who have been briefed on the matter said. The board has retained outside investment bankers to do the deal.
Saks and Investcorp declined to comment last night.
By many measures, Saks has performed well. The company's earnings rose 95 percent in its last fiscal year, to $55.8 million on sales of $2.2 billion. Sales have been growing at a compound rate of 15.6 percent since 1994. And sales at stores open at least one year, the best measure of a retailer's health, rose 3.8 percent last year. The company has significantly reduced its debt load, which was a terrible drag on it in the early part of the decade. Its most recent quarter was especially stellar.
But it has been stymied by inconsistent sales, especially in its Off Fifth division, its outlet shops, where same-store sales fell 6.5 percent last year. Those weak sales, and a weakness in the market for lower-priced apparel, known as bridge wear, pushed the cost of goods sold up 13.8 percent last year.
What is more, the company is perceived to have a merchandising management weakness, analysts said. Last fall, Rose Marie Bravo, the company's president, resigned to become chief executive officer of Burberrys Worldwide. The company was unable to find an adequate replacement, and instead appointed an executive vice president of merchandising, Jeanne B. Daniel, from Tiffany.
Still, Saks has one of the most famous names in the universe of retailing, and a strong crop of managers, most notably Brian E. Kendrick, the company's chief operating officer, who has earned much respect on Wall Street.
The question, however, is: Is there a retailer left to make the purchase? The industry has consolidated greatly over the last decade, leaving few independent luxury chains looking to grow. Among its competitors, Neiman Marcus, a unit of Harcourt General, is an obvious candidate, as are LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton, the luxury holding company based in Paris that owns a number of the high-end brands found on the store's floors, and Dickson Poon, which is looking to have a presence in New York.
Both of those companies, however, have been badly hurt by Asia's economic crisis. The closest thing Federated Department Stores has to a Saks is Bloomingdale's, which is still considerably less fancy than Saks, which has courted an even wealthier customer base in the last few years.
Still, retailers are always looking for new ways to gain economies of scale; indeed last year Saks made a bid for Barneys New York, which is operating under Chapter 11 bankrutpcy protection, for $290 million for the company. The offer was rebuffed by Barney's creditors, and Saks later said it would offer no more. LVMH and Dickson Poon also looked at Barneys last year.
Saks was founded in 1867, and as a privately held company operated as a division of Gimbel Brothers Inc., the department store that is now defunct. In September 1924, Horace Saks and Bernard Gimbel opened the landmark Fifth Avenue store, which today accounts for roughly 20 percent of the entire company's sales.
In 1973, Saks & Company was acquired by B.A.T. Industries P.L.C. through its acquisition of Gimbel Brothers. Investcorp bought the company in 1990 from B.A.T.
Today, Saks Holdings, the holding company for the retailer, operates 41 full-line stores, 5 scaled-down stores in smaller cities as well as 8 small stores catering to resort regions. Its off-price store, Off Fifth, is in 43 locations.
In its 131 years, Saks has seen its competitors fade away. In New York City, the retail capital of the world, there is no B. Altman anymore. There is no Bonwit Teller. And Henri Bendel is a shadow of its former self. Saks is in many ways in a rarified class by itself.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
As Yen Slides, U.S. Renews Pressure on Japan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
A week after the Clinton Administration signed off on a multibillion-dollar intervention in the currency markets to support the Japanese yen, American authorities stepped up pressure on the Japanese Government today to make good on its promises of economic reform and avoid another decline in the yen's value.
"The steps we can take -- currency intervention -- can have an effect, but they can have an effect primarily through what they signal," Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today, hours after returning from a trip to Japan and Indonesia. "What is crucial is the pace of action," he said. 
 So far, investors seem to have been unimpressed with the speed of Japan's efforts to clean up $600 billion in bad bank debts, spur the economy and accelerate the deregulation of its financial markets. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told President Clinton last week that he would accelerate those efforts, a promise that led to the joint intervention in the currency markets last Wednesday. That sent the yen's value up sharply, though briefly -- it lingered at a rate around 136 to the dollar for a day or so.
But the yen has slipped ever since, as Japanese leaders reverted to talking about the difficulties inherent in moving quickly. Late today, the yen settled in New York trading at 141.25 to the dollar, compared with 139.15 on Tuesday, and not far below the level when the United States agreed to step in.
Investors appeared to interpret Mr. Summers's comments as suggesting that Washington would not intervene again any time soon. But they have been burned once before: When Mr. Summers's boss, Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin, told Congress earlier this month that interventions only worked temporarily, traders saw that as a green light to bet against the Japanese currency. Their rush to sell yen at that time gave Mr. Rubin an opportunity to take the markets by surprise.
Today, Mr. Summers also told the Senate committee he had received additional assurances from Chinese officials that they were "committed to maintain exchange-rate stability," despite growing pressure to devalue their currency, the yuan.
United States officials fear that a devaluation, while intended to keep Chinese exports competitively priced with the goods of other Asian nations, would greatly worsen the Asian financial crisis -- setting off another round of currency devaluations.
President Clinton is expected to raise these matters directly when he meets with Chinese leaders in Beijing this weekend. But already the Administration is praising China for its restraint, and the Chinese are hoping to parlay their resolve not to devalue into some kind of diplomatic advantage.
Mr. Summers said further today that the International Monetary Fund was on the verge of another economic agreement with Indonesia -- its fourth, but the first since President Suharto's resignation. While details of the accord are skimpy, it will enable the I.M.F. to resume aid to Jakarta at a time when economic projections for the country are growing considerably more dire.
The country is suffering what United States officials call a food crisis, with increasing reports of malnutrition in outlying islands, after years in which Indonesia boasted of self-sufficiency in food production. The number of Indonesians living below the poverty line may increase by almost 80 million this year, or nearly 40 percent of the population, the World Bank warned several days ago.
American officials fear that such distress would worsen attacks on ethnic Chinese in Indonesia.
Mr. Summers made an oblique reference to such attacks today. He said that when he met with Indonesia's new President, B. J. Habibie, in Jakarta on Monday, he told him "it is essential that all of Indonesia's people, rich and poor alike, enjoy a sense of security that their homes, their businesses and their futures in the country are secure."
The focus of Mr. Summers's testimony today, though, was on Japan, and he repeated the theme that the Japanese had only a brief "window of opportunity" to act.
But in private, many at the Treasury and the White House are skeptical about how much Japanese leaders will be able to deliver before Prime Minister Hashimoto visits Washington on July 22 -- a visit that is intended in part to keep pressure on Japan and in part to appease it after Mr. Clinton's extended visit to China, which begins in Xian on Thursday.
"The situation in Japan is a source of very considerable concern," Mr. Summers said today. "Growth has turned negative; the banking system is increasingly stressed. While the passage last week of a significant stimulus package is a welcome step, we remain very concerned about Japan's economic and financial situation."
"This is a pivotal moment for Asia and the global economy," he added. The weakness in Japan is now having a clear impact on the other troubled economies in Asia."

HEADLINE: Paul O'Dwyer, New York's Liberal Battler For Underdogs and Outsiders, Dies at 90

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

 BODY:
Paul O'Dwyer, a spirited liberal voice in New York politics from his immigrant days in the Democratic clubhouse to his glory years as a fiery anti-Vietnam War insurgent, died Tuesday night at his home in Goshen, N.Y. He was 90.
Mr. O'Dwyer had been in failing health from the effects of a stroke and died quietly in his sleep, according to his nephew and law partner, Frank Durkan. 
 To his deathbed, Paul O'Dwyer, a white-maned, fiercely browed advocate, embraced a raft of minority causes, identifying with indigents and immigrants, progressives and underdogs well beyond America -- from the guerrilla fighters for a Jewish home state to the diehard rebels of his beloved Ireland.
Mr. O'Dwyer was an enduring if rarely elected politician who impressed successive generations as an eloquent battler in the name of conscience. Arriving in America at age 18, he labored up from dock work and garment packing to become one of New York's leading defenders of the underclass.
"The ideals should always come first," Mr. O'Dwyer counseled in a long public life steeped in voluntary civil-rights battles and vociferous challenges of the political establishment.
Elected twice to the New York City Council, he seemed more at home in the politics of the outsider. As an Irishman who had lived under British occupation, he heartily joined the ongoing American struggle against prejudice suffered variously by Jews, blacks, women and the very latest immigrant wave.
"Politics is the only machinery around on which you can really straighten things out," he said in his softly unyielding brogue.
A fleet, unapologetic gadfly, Paul was the antithesis of his older brother William, who rose from the police force to become an urbane master of machine politics as Mayor of New York from 1946 until 1950, when scandals shook his administration. The O'Dwyers moved separately on the crest of Irish-American political power before it faded in the city.
Paul O'Dwyer far outlasted his brother "Bill-O" in public life, fighting for the labor movement and embattled immigrants in the 1940's, against McCarthyism and racial segregation in the 50's, and against the Vietnam War in the 60's. In the antiwar movement, he stood as a patriarchal exception in the eyes of young pacifists intent on trusting no one over 30.
 
'We Were Changing This Nation'
An ally of Senator Eugene J. McCarthy in the successful antiwar challenge to President Lyndon B. Johnson's renomination in 1968, Mr. O'Dwyer scored an upset victory himself in the New York Democratic Senate primary that year, but lost in the November election to Senator Jacob K. Javits.
"We were taking a country engrossed in an immoral war," he declared afterward, pounding the arm of his chair in celebration of that struggle. "We were changing this nation. By God, we did it. We did do it."
He could make a rampart of a legal brief, too, successfully litigating a landmark 1951 fight against the powerful Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. That suit opened the way for blacks to live in Stuyvesant Town, a huge Manhattan housing complex, and presaged an era of desegregation across the nation.
Mr. O'Dwyer honed his courtroom skills suing insurance companies in negligence cases. But his outside interests were his larger life: He successfully defended Kentucky miners accused of blowing up a bridge in a union dispute, just as he won acquittal of a black teen-ager accused of homicide in a New York City riot in the mid-60's. He sued City Hall to force more budget money into public transit for the working class, just as he defended an unpopular union chief during a city garbage collection strike. In 1958, he joined with Eleanor Roosevelt and Herbert H. Lehman, the former Governor, to found the Committee for Democratic Voters, the state party reform movement.
But his outspokenness for minority causes helped deny him a mainstream role in politics. As president of the New York chapter of the National Lawyers Guild, Mr. O'Dwyer was denounced as a radical for angrily challenging Red-baiting assaults on civil liberties by politicians who were intent on searching for Communist leanings among teachers and other government workers.
"When you come from the period of, first, the Depression and then the McCarthy era," he explained, "if you survive that, then you're less likely to be cautious expressing yourself."
Paul O'Dwyer was among the first volunteers litigating in Deep South integration struggles. "It was like a present on Christmas morning," he enthused about his participation. He was also gladly troublesome as a delegate to the 1964 Democratic National Convention, leading the fight to see the black Freedom Democratic party of Mississippi represented. Personally close to a generation of black politicians, Mr. O'Dwyer managed the campaigns of several. He was credited by Mayor David N. Dinkins with salvaging his career by coaxing him back into public life after Mr. Dinkins had earlier been forced to resign a city job because of his failure to file income tax returns from 1969 to 1972.
"As a young person, impressionable, I almost forgot who I was, as the Irish often do here," Mr. O'Dwyer once commented on the roots of his desegregation fervor. "Because you are white you think you will be treated equally. I was corrected by my brothers, who were here ahead of me."
He rued the fading of an era when "Irish Catholic" was synonymous with "liberal Democrat," and told the joke about a tenement clubhouse boss scandalized at the news that O'Brien had turned Republican. "That's a damned lie," the boss thundered. "I saw O'Brien at Mass last Sunday."
As a civil libertarian, Mr. O'Dwyer tapped into vivid memories from his Irish childhood of insurrection against British occupation forces. "The Black and Tans used to drive through the town, shooting it up," he said, recalling the rampages of the British auxiliary police. "It wasn't too different from Mississippi."
 
Defended Berrigan And Bricklayers
A florid-faced, articulate bantam, Mr. O'Dwyer successfully argued before the Supreme Court for the right of mainland Puerto Ricans to take their voter literacy test in Spanish. In 1972, he stood in defense of a pacifist group called the Harrisburg Eight, led by the Rev. Philip F. Berrigan, and won them a mistrial on charges of an anti-Government plot against the Nixon Administration during the Vietnam War.
No less fervidly did he represent uncelebrated sandhogs, hod carriers and warehouse clerks in formative trade union years when, he recalled, "strikebreaking and union-busting remained widespread and brutal." He carried a union card in Local 975 of the International Longshoremen's Association. In 1968, he declined to cross a wildcat picket line outside a television studio when he was a Senate candidate, telephoning the apoplectic interviewer to explain, "These are my people."
Mr. O'Dwyer accepted the role of the city's Commissioner for the United Nations during the Dinkins administration. But soon he was boycotting the U.N. cafeteria for its anti-unionism, and finally resigned so he could speak out against human rights abuses by some of the nations he was supposed to be welcoming.
Born June 29, 1907, in the village of Bohola, County Mayo, in western Ireland, Peter Paul O'Dwyer was the 11th and last surviving child of Patrick and Bridget McNicholas O'Dwyer. They were schoolteachers who raised their family in Ireland's grim potato economy, packed into a rude house without plumbing. He later endowed a home for the handicapped on his family home site.
"I sprang from the 'shabby genteel,' " he once said with a smile, using Eugene O'Neill's qualification for the striving Irish poor. Paul O'Dwyer counted himself fortunate for the high school education he received before having to follow four older brothers to New York in the age-old immigration of young Irish to opportunity.
He soon picked up on the politics of Jefferson and Paine after finding clannish lodgings in Mrs. Maguire's Irish boarding house at West 103d Street and Columbus Avenue in Manhattan. Landing a paying job within two days -- a touch of clubhouse patronage via brother "Bill-O" -- he moved fast on the classic immigrant's route to betterment through night school, first at Fordham University, then at St. John's Law School in Brooklyn.
So fast did he move that he had to obtain special permission from Chief Judge Benjamin Nathan Cardozo of the New York Court of Appeals to take his bar exam in 1929, four years after arriving from Ireland and two years before he could receive citizenship. In 1931, Paul O'Dwyer became America's newest citizen-lawyer, ringing with the impulses of Thomas Paine. "He sounded simple and logical to my young mind," Mr. O'Dwyer explained.
Anti-Semitism in college fraternities had bonded him to Jewish friends, he recalled in his 1979 autobiography, "Counsel for the Defense." "And the Kings County Young Democratic Club thenceforward was made up of 35 Jewish classmates and me," he noted proudly.
It followed naturally that he was involved in the cause of a Jewish homeland in 1946 by arranging for the illegal entry of Holocaust survivors to Palestine and by aiding the gun-running operations of the Irgun militants fighting the British in the Holy Land. The next year, as chairman of the Lawyers' Committee for Justice in Palestine, he pleaded at the United Nations for Israeli sovereignty.
Successfully defending an admitted Jewish gun-runner in New York in 1948, Mr. O'Dwyer told the court, "He was only doing what every other freedom-loving person would be doing."
As a lawyer, Mr. O'Dwyer became a principal in one of the city's flagship immigrant law firms, O'Dwyer & Bernstien. He began as a clerk to Oscar Bernstien and worked his way to senior partner. From the firm's offices in the financial district, Mr. O'Dwyer helped build the business but found time for assorted challenges to social injustice, typically without fee. He soon was respected as one of the city's sharper-tongued liberals.
"If I thought at the end of the year that all I did was make a living, I'd regard it as a pretty incomplete year," he said of his rich life as an agitator within the system.
"If I've had any success at all, it's been in large measure from listening to young people," said Mr. O'Dwyer, whose eagle-like visage -- a dark-eyed glare and shock of prematurely white hair -- stood out in the thick of any battle.
 
Leading a Welcome For Gerry Adams
Even in decline he stayed keen for political justice. In 1994, he beamed from a wheelchair and led the welcoming cheers when Gerry Adams, the Northern Irish republican political leader, was finally allowed into the United States to plead his grievance against Britain. Mr. O'Dwyer was the national coordinator for the American League for an Undivided Ireland.
He ran 12 times for elective office in campaigns noteworthy for threadbare war chests and left-liberal agendas, daring to call for decriminalizing drug addiction in one. His two successes were in 1963, as Councilman at Large in Manhattan, and 1973, as City Council President, a post in which he made sure to alter the city's official founding date from 1664, when the British landed, to 1625, when Dutch settlers arrived. In six total years in office, he instigated numerous causes, including an uphill battle in 1965 to raise the city's minimum wage to $1.50 an hour.
Mr. O'Dwyer's abiding comfort was in the good fight. Losing to Carol Bellamy in a 1977 bid to remain Council President, he said, "I fought for a lot of civil rights 25, 35 years ago, including women's rights, and I'm in poor shape to complain if I find myself in the way of the machinery that I myself helped set in motion."
He offered a decidedly Irish smile of bemusement when critics focused on his antiwar activity and tried to dismiss him as a single-issue politician.
"The one issue is fair play over the period of a lifetime," Mr. O'Dwyer amended.
His wife of 45 years, the former Kathleen Rohan, died in 1980. In 1984 he married Patricia Hanrahan, then the upstate chief of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's women's division. She survives him, along with four children from his first marriage: William, of Albany; Rory, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Brian, of Manhattan, and Eileen O'Dwyer Hughes of New York. He had eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
Mr. O'Dwyer long tried to persuade his wife, Patricia, to restake the family flag in elective politics. She finally agreed this year, and he lived to see her running for the 95th State Assembly District in Orange County, true to his favorite line of Yeats:
That I may seem, though I die old,
A foolish, passionate man.

HEADLINE: Democrats in China

 BODY:
We would feel more confident about the lasting value of President Clinton's trip to China, which begins today, if we knew that someone had included among his briefing papers a summary of Ronald Reagan's extraordinary visit to the Soviet Union in 1988. Mr. Reagan used that trip to meet with prominent dissidents and speak directly to Soviet audiences about fundamental freedoms and the advantages of democracy, and there was little that his host, Mikhail Gorbachev, could do about it but grumble. Mr. Reagan knew that one of the important powers of a traveling President is the right to speak plainly in lands unaccustomed to open debate. Bill Clinton has the same luxury. The cause of human rights will be poorer if he squanders it.
Mr. Clinton's aides have said he will address the issue in some way, and there is no shortage of promising venues. His itinerary includes a small village that has just conducted its first open election, an ecumenical church and a classroom at Beijing University. But there is one obvious setting in which Mr. Clinton can seize the moment, politely but firmly, to assert American values. That is Tiananmen Square, which he will visit on Saturday, and where hundreds of peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators were slaughtered on June 4, 1989. 
 The Chinese, of course, prefer to see Mr. Clinton's visit to Tiananmen Square not as a reminder of that tragedy but as a form of closure, a way of saying farewell to a relationship strained by that memory and moving quickly to the "constructive strategic partnership" celebrated in last fall's meeting in Washington between Mr. Clinton and China's President, Jiang Zemin. But why accept Beijing's definition of what the Tiananmen visit means? More than 700 people were arrested there nine years ago, and many are still in prison. Mr. Clinton can honor their memory by describing their sacrifice as a reminder of how much further China and its leaders must travel.
This is one of the points the President's Republican critics have been trying to make on Capitol Hill. On Tuesday they tried unsuccessfully to ram through a series of amendments that, among other things, would have denied visas to Chinese officials involved in religious persecution or forced abortions, and put new restrictions on some forms of economic aid to Beijing. Senate Democrats said the entire exercise was an attempt to embarrass the President. "I'm not going to allow one single vote on China this week," said Senator Thomas Daschle, the Democratic leader. But there are also plenty of liberal Democrats who believe that in pursuing his policy of engagement Mr. Clinton has looked squishy on human rights.
Of course China cannot be viewed through a single lens, and of course there will be other important issues on the President's agenda in the next nine days. But the Chinese leadership has already profited greatly from his visit. His very presence is an affirmation of Beijing's growing power. The Chinese are certainly strong enough to hear straight talk on American values and a Presidential statement of solidarity with the democrats in Chinese society. A show of Presidential will would not disrupt the trip. It might even make it memorable.

HEADLINE: Voracious Computers Are Siphoning Talent From Academia

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

 BODY:
The high-tech field, the fastest growing of the nation's economy, has become so voracious in its hiring that computer science departments across the country are losing graduate students and, in growing numbers, undergraduates to an industry fueled by vast sums of money.
While the evidence is still anecdotal, universities report that faculty positions in computer science are going unfilled and doctoral programs have seen a big drop-off in applications. Moreover, students working toward master and bachelor degrees are increasingly abandoning their studies for well-paying jobs in a field whose wealthy stars, like Bill Gates, famously dropped out of college. 
 As a result, many experts fear that fundamental research will decline and that the next generation of American computer scientists will be stunted.
"I'm afraid we're eating our seed corn," said Peter J. Denning, vice provost of George Mason University in Virginia.
For many young people, a job paying $30,000 to $60,000 a year seems far more appealing than pursuing a degree whose value is unclear.
"A degree is just a piece of paper with a gold stamp on it," said Jonah Blossom, 20, who left Santa Barbara City College after one year to take a full-time $30,000-a-year job as an on-line computer specialist at a nearby concern where some of his bosses and colleagues did not finish their studies. "That paper isn't going to help you find bugs in a system or create compelling Web sites. That depends on your ability. My employers are not interested in certificates or where I've been to school."
While other academic fields over the years have witnessed shifts in talent away from universities -- it happened in biotechnology in the 1980's -- there is no precedent to what is happening today in computers both in the scale and in the challenge it poses to the discipline. It is as if every college student with any athletic ability suddenly faced the realistic prospect of a career with a professional sports team.
"Without wanting to sound hysterical, this is really changing the shape of education in a fundamental way," said Guy Smith, who runs the multimedia laboratory at Santa Barbara City College. "You hear of kids leaving high school and making almost six figures. Recently we brought in 30 computer information officers and asked them about entry-level skills. I didn't hear the word 'degree' come up very often."
Joseph A. Liemandt dropped out of Stanford University after his junior year and founded the Trilogy Development Group, a hugely successful software marketing company in Austin, Tex., in 1989. Mr. Liemandt says his company, like many others, simply does not care about an applicant's university credentials.
"If we interview two people and one has a 4.0 from M.I.T. in computer science and doesn't impress us in the interview," Mr. Liemandt said, "and the other dropped out of some small college and impressed us, we'd always hire the second guy.
"I personally didn't learn anything in college classes. And when I hear people talking about taking two years to earn an M.B.A., I remind them that there are companies that went from zero to $70 million in two years. Take your pick. A lot of people come to work for us because they want to start their own companies and figure two years with us are better than an M.B.A."
Computer science professors, in something of a state of shock, are sharply divided over what is happening and over how to respond.
Most are warning that when the overheated market for programmers and Web-site designers cools or shifts in emphasis, those who have left their studies will be, in essence, laid-off blue-collar workers without credentials, like telephone operators after digital switching or auto workers after robotics.
"Our message is, 'Make sure you aim to get yourself a career and not just a first job,' " said Ellen F. Hartigan, vice president of student affairs at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, who says her students are being recruited to leave for full-time jobs before getting their degrees.
"Many of our students are the first generation in their family to go to college and they don't have the parental support that encourages them to stay on and finish and go to graduate school," Ms. Hartigan said. "These offers are very tempting. So we are now much more pro-active, teaching freshmen about career preparation."
At Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, Richard Newman, associate dean of engineering, says his institution is trying to compromise with corporate raiders by urging cooperative ventures whereby the companies pay for students to complete their studies while they work.
"We even had two or three freshmen go off to take jobs setting up Web pages," Mr. Newman said. "We're trying to find a solution to end the competition between us and industry."
But some computer experts say universities have failed to keep computer science curriculums up to date.
"Universities have done such a bad job of providing what you need to know that a B.A. in computer science is almost considered worthless," said Allen Holub, an author and computer design consultant in San Francisco. "Many tenured professors came out of math departments. Mathematicians make lousy programmers. They focus on algorithms, which are the underlying rules of some programs. But the vast majority of programs today are not algorithm based but data based."
Kenneth E. Martin, a professor of computer and information sciences at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, and a member of the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board, acknowledges that the gap between theory and practice has grown dangerously large.
This is partly because of the growth of sophisticated new computer languages, like Java, with which programmers can draw on a pre-packaged set of formulas and tools and simply plug them in, without a need for understanding the underlying theory of computer language.
"Curriculums are going to have to change." Professor Martin said. "There is no question about it. Right now, we can't compete. You can legitimately ask whether what we teach is as important as it used to be.
"Today, it is more of a hacker's world, and it is less obvious that students need to know the fundamentals to function at a high level. With the arrival of Java, they don't program in the same way as in older languages.
"After a semester learning Java, a student can already do an incredible amount. My colleagues see their former students with a B.S. and stock options. Maybe that's better than an M.S."
The existence of well-paid, creative work without full academic credentials in an exciting field is the result of both economic and cultural factors. The American computer industry is exploding. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that the need for systems analysts, engineers and computer scientists will more than double from now until 2006.
Today there are an estimated 933,000 jobs in these fields; by 2006, the bureau estimates that number will rise to 1.9 million. Yet the nation's computer science programs are only graduating 25,000 students with bachelors' degrees yearly.
This projected gap is borne out by the experience of those in career services.
"If every one of the 1,600 students graduating this year from Northeastern were computer majors, they would all have jobs," said Carol S. Lyons, dean of career services at Northeastern University in Boston. "We're seeing signing bonuses of $7,000 to $9,000, relocation offers, stock options and starting salaries in the high 30's to low 50's."
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh reports that applications to its graduate program in computer science dropped to about 500 this year, from a high of about 900 just a few years ago. And the size of the graduate program at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo has declined to about 40 from 60 in the last few years.
Avram Cheaney, 22, who grew up in West Virginia, quit Carnegie-Mellon and moved to Silicon Valley in California several months ago. He posted his resume on the Internet through a temporary computer employment agency and received 25 calls. Today he earns $40 an hour.
"I feel like I can work anywhere," Mr. Cheaney said. "Any company that has computers needs people, and with my experience, I am light-years ahead of many people still in school. Two years' experience is all that is needed. You can't say, 'I've been a Web-page designer for 10 years' because the field hasn't been around that long. The younger generation can get a jump on things."
Another attraction is the anti-conventional nature of an industry, many of whose giants -- Steven P. Jobs and Stephen Wozniak, the founders of Apple computers, in addition to Mr. Gates, -- are college dropouts. Job opportunities at computer companies often emphasize loose dress codes and strange hours as well as the financial possibilities.
Here, for example, is how Trilogy, the Austin software company, describes its "company culture" on its Web site:
"What matters at Trilogy? Results, results, results. The focus is not on how many meetings you attend or that you show up for work at 7 in the morning every day. What's more important is the value you add to Trilogy and the experience you bring. As for work hours, Trilogy believes in flexibility. It makes the most sense that people work when they are most productive, and only you know when that is."
It says that some employees dress fancy for work because they want to while others "wear a clean T-shirt and shoes when they want to dress up," adding: "Some work from 5 A.M. to 5 P.M., others don't believe in the cruel and unusual abuse of alarm clocks and never show their faces before lunch time." There is further talk of huge bonuses and "company boats, spontaneous trips to Las Vegas, nights out on the town, trips to Hawaii, fully stocked kitchens."
Employers say there are distinct advantages to younger people. They have enormous energy, are willing to work long hours and still consider working all night an adventure. But others say they prefer to hire people who have finished college, both because their minds are more trained and disciplined and because it is better for them to get their degrees.
"We want to use their talents and be respectful of their education," said Dawn Legg, director of operations at Dega Technologies in San Luis Obispo, Calif., a start-up company whose Web master is 18 years old. "At the same time, we have a business to run."
Many of those who left college to take jobs say they want to go back to school, either part time soon or full time later, both for the sake of long-term job security and for the satisfaction of having completed their degrees. But their elders worry that by the time those former students feel the need to return, it will be too late.
James L. Beug, chairman of computer sciences at California Polytechnic, put it this way: "I have students from 10 years ago saying, 'Oh, Jim, my company just folded and I don't have my degree to make a new job search.' Meanwhile, our curriculum has changed vastly from 10 years ago.
"My fear is that these kids who haven't finished will last about seven years on the job market. If they haven't learned to learn and can't go sideways into management, what happens to them?"

HEADLINE: White House Revises Policy On Contracts for Minorities

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
The White House today announced a new affirmative-action policy under which minority-owned businesses will be given an advantage when they compete for Government contracts in industries where surveys show they are underrepresented but not in industries where they seem to have a fair share of the market.
What this means, for example, is that companies controlled by blacks will get a leg up in trucking contracts with the Government but not in food manufacturing. 
 In the case of construction, a preference will be given to minority contractors in some regions of the country, where surveys show that their share of the Government's business is smaller than could be expected, but not in other parts of the country.
All told, affirmative action will be employed in industries representing about three-quarters of the money the Government spends on procurement contracts with small businesses, the White House said.
The policy was devised to meet the terms of a Supreme Court decision in 1995 that strictly limited the justification and scope of Government programs that grant preferences based on race or sex.
In a statement issued by the White House shortly after he left for China, President Clinton said that the new rules "continue my promise to mend, not end affirmative action."
The approach, he added, "satisfies constitutional requirements while targeting our efforts in areas where disparities still exist."
Opponents of affirmative action challenged the new policy. Abigail Thernstrom, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and one of the most outspoken academic critics of racial preferences, called the policy "old wine in new bottles."
"Counting heads is a bad way of measuring discrimination," Ms. Thernstrom said.
Representative Charles T. Canady, a Florida Republican who is the sponsor of legislation to end racial preferences in Government programs, said that under the new policy "decisions will still be made on the basis of ethnic background" and that "classifications based on race are inherently harmful."
Many supporters of affirmative action were pleased. Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat who heads the Congressional Black Caucus, said the new policy will "provide opportunities for qualified minority businesses to compete openly and fairly for Federal Government contracting opportunities."
But Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, which lobbies for the interests of members of minorities, called the policy "at best a mixed bag."
Mr. Henderson said he was afraid it will "mean a loss of business for some women and minority-owned firms."
The Administration has defended the principle of affirmative action in Congress and the courts. But since the 1995 Supreme Court ruling, it has curtailed or cut back many of the dozens of programs throughout the Government involving racial preferences.
For example, all programs were ended in which a specific sum of money or percentage of contracts was set aside for minority-owned companies. In addition, programs designed to help members of minorities and women win contracts from the Federal Highway Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency have been reduced in scale. So have programs to increase the number of minority teachers, scientists and Foreign Service officers.
But until now, there has not been a Government-wide policy on how to handle procurement contracts.
In the Supreme Court's decision, in which it voted 5 to 4 in a case called Adarand Constructors v. Pena, it held that Government programs that extended advantages to members of minorities had to serve a "compelling national interest" and be "narrowly tailored" to address the effects of discrimination.
The policy announced today applies to what the Government calls "small disadvantaged businesses" and affects every Government procurement contract for which there is open bidding. It does not need to be approved by Congress. It will go into effect in stages between now and Jan. 1.
Businesses owned by American Indians and Americans who are black, Hispanic or Asian are presumed to be disadvantaged. Those owned by whites, including women, fit the standard only if they can show through a "preponderance of the evidence" that they are socially and economically disadvantaged.
Businesses that are considered disadvantaged and bid for contracts in particular industries will be entitled to a 10 percent price break. That means that they will be the low bidder if their price is within 10 percent of the low bid filed by a business that is not disadvantaged.
To determine where discrimination exists, the Government evaluated more than 70 industries. The survey compared in the fiscal year 1996 the value of contracts in each industry that went to disadvantaged businesses, called utilization, with what it called the capacity of such companies to perform the contracts.
Capacity was based on such factors as the age and size of the companies and was meant to show the value of contracts that would go to disadvantaged businesses if everything else was equal.
The method was called benchmarking.
Under the policy, the 10 percent price break will be allowed only in industries where the value of contracts let in the year studied was well below the capacity of disadvantaged businesses.
For instance, affirmative action will be allowed in textile mill products, where 2.2 percent of the money went to disadvantaged businesses but the capacity was said to be 8.3 percent. It will also be allowed in oil and gas extraction, where utilization was 9.7 percent and capacity 13.8 percent, and in trucking, where utilization was 21.4 percent and capacity was 35.4 percent.
But affirmative action will not be allowed in food manufacturing, where 10.4 percent of the value of contracts went to disadvantaged businesses and the capacity was said to be 8.3 percent. Other examples of industries where the price break will not be permitted are forestry and fishing, with 25.2 percent utilization and 18.6 percent capacity, and agriculture, 41.5 percent utilization and 29.9 percent capacity.
The White House said that in most industries a nationwide survey was sufficient. But in the case of construction contracts, the country was broken down into nine regions because of the disparity in hiring in different areas.
Affirmative action will be practiced for general contractors in the Middle Atlantic States, where the survey found that only 13.6 percent of Government contract money went to disadvantaged contractors, while the capacity was 18 percent. But it will not apply in construction contracts with general contractors in the Pacific States, where utilization was 29.4 percent and capacity was 27.1 percent.
The White House promised to keep updating the survey.

OPEC Reaches New Deal to Cut Oil Production

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: VIENNA, June 24

 BODY:
Overcoming a serious political dispute that split the Iranian delegation and threatened the final agreement, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced late today that it planned to reduce its oil production by more than 1.3 million barrels a day, or nearly 5 percent, in the latest attempt to push up prices.
The 11 members of OPEC and other producers have been facing a severe crisis since oil prices began a sharp decline in November, falling below $12 a barrel last week to the lowest level in more than a decade. Two earlier moves to reduce production, including sharp cutbacks pledged in March, have largely failed to keep prices from dropping. 
 The much-anticipated agreement was announced here at the meeting of OPEC oil ministers near the close of the commodity markets in New York today. The dispute among the Iranians had sent oil prices dropping during the day, wiping out an early rally in European markets after reports that a deal was imminent. But prices ended little changed, with crude oil for August delivery settling up 8 cents, at $14.60 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The Iranian split, as well as OPEC's reputation for being unable to maintain production cutbacks, left some experts questioning how long the agreement would hold. "It is a fragile agreement by its very nature, as it depends on the pledge of each country to cut its production," said Fadhil al-Chalabi, a former OPEC under secretary. He added that some countries might again be tempted to increase production if prices rise.
The deal was nearly scuttled early this evening, shortly before it was first to have been announced, when the Iranian oil minister, Bijan Namdar-Zanganeh, who represents the moderate views of President Mohammed Khatami, engaged in a public dispute with Kazempour Ardebili, a senior figure in the Iranian leadership who tends to reflect the views of the Revolutionary Guards and other hard-liners.
The two officials argued loudly over who had the authority to speak for Iran during the final negotiations over the production accord. Several OPEC oil ministers who attended that meeting said privately afterward that they feared the dispute would deflate any rally in oil prices the agreement might otherwise have brought.
At one point during the session, according to several officials who were present, Nigeria's oil minister, Dan Etete, raised his walking stick in anger at the two Iranians, proclaiming, "This is no way to do business."
In the end, the Iranians and several oil ministers stormed out of the closed-door meeting, and OPEC was forced to delay the announcement of the agreement.
"When a senior member of the Iranian delegation disagrees with his minister publicly, it poses a big question mark about what is happening there," a senior Arab delegate said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "Can you imagine what it would be like if in our delegation the minister and the deputy minister argued over who speaks for the country?"
But other officials said there were some benefits from bringing the Iranian dispute out into the open. "It is good that a misunderstanding has been aired here because last time when we here in March, we left with two different Iranian interpretations of a deal," said Nordine Ait Laoussine, Algeria's former oil minister, who is a senior adviser to his country's OPEC delegation. "This time, we are all clear as to where Iran stands."
By agreeing this time to cut their daily output by 1.3 million barrels, the 11 members of OPEC have pledged since March to remove a daily total of about 2.6 million barrels from the market.
If OPEC, which controls about 40 percent of the world's oil production, can live up to those commitments, it could significantly reduce the excess supplies of crude oil that have sent prices plunging. But too often, oil producers both in and outside OPEC have failed to meet all their pledges.
Late in March, for instance, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, with Mexico helping as intermediary, led a coalition of oil exporters that agreed to cut oil output by 1.7 million barrels a day. But fewer than one million barrels are estimated to have actually been taken out of production, and oil prices, which initially rallied, resumed their decline.
Earlier this month, a number of these countries agreed to cut a further total of 740,000 barrels, starting on July 1.
The production cutbacks announced by OPEC today will expand on the reductions planned for July 1 by more than 600,000 barrels a day.
The biggest sacrifice in production is to come from Saudi Arabia, which plans to reduce its output by 425,000 barrels daily. Venezuela promised to cut its oil output by 325,000 barrels, and the United Arab Emirates by 100,000 barrels a day.
After much negotiation, Iran agreed to lower its production by 65,000 barrels a day instead of OPEC's request for a 95,000-barrel cutback. Mr. Ardebili, who is an adviser to Iran's Foreign Minister and the oil minister as well as Iran's governor on the OPEC board, insisted on the smaller cut, saying this quantity was what the Government had authorized. But Mr. Namdar-Zanganeh, the Iranian oil minister, said he would agree to a larger cut.
A senior Arab official said the differences in these Iranian positions reflected concerns over the rising production of oil by Iraq, Iran's rival and its wartime enemy in the 1980's. Over the last year, the Iraqi Government of President Saddam Hussein has raised its production of oil with United Nations permission to 2.2 million barrels a day, of which it exports 1.7 million barrels, crowding Iranian and Saudi sales.
It does so under an oil-for-food agreement worked out with the United Nations, and if its production should continue to expand, the Iraqis might reclaim their old position as OPEC's second-largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia, passing the Iranians.
For that reason, the hard-liners in Teheran have insisted on giving as little as possible. But President Khatami's Government, which is eager to improve ties with the rest of the world, has insisted on more cooperation. Both tendencies are represented in Iran's OPEC delegation.
A number of non-OPEC countries that attended the meeting as observers, including representatives of Mexico, Russia, Norway and Oman, have made some production cuts themselves.
Mexico, which reduced its output by 100,000 barrels a day at the beginning of April, plans to cut another 100,000 in July.
But Norway, which has cut 100,000 barrels a day, has no plans for further reductions. Russia pledged reductions this year of 80,000 barrels daily, and Oman offered a 50,000- barrel-a-day cut.
OPEC officials acknowledged that it would take a while for the market to verify that these pledges had been carried out.
And, there is concern here that the Asian economic crisis, which has removed about one million barrels a day in demand, could grow worse, making further production cuts necessary.

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts Won't End Japan's Woes

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your June 20 editorial "Time for Action in Japan" spoke to the need for aggressive tax cuts, ostensibly to stimulate domestic spending. This would militate against the tendency for Japan to export its way out of recession, at the expense of its beleaguered Asian neighbors. 
 Unfortunately, cultural inclinations, an aging population and availability of foreign investment would probably push most of any reasonable increase in family income into savings, not spending. Furthermore, most middle-class Japanese are saturated with consumer goods. An important reason is that they simply don't have the space to house more.
The land on which to build larger, affordable housing around Japan's cities exists. However, its cost has been out of sight because the Government pays part-time farmers to grow rice or fruit or raise a few head of cattle on tiny plots. We need to press Japan to do whatever is necessary to create affordable housing for its citizens.

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts Won't End Japan's Woes

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Time for Action in Japan" (editorial, June 20): Some Administration officials' reading of Japan's economic policy -- that the country's hidden strategy is to let the yen fall, making Japanese goods less expensive in the United States -- ignores a fundamental problem facing Japan. The country depends on imports for nearly all natural resources. 
 Oil, essential for Japan's survival, will cost more if the yen is weak. The same is true of food, for which Japan depends on imports.
If a weaker yen continues, it will hit ordinary Japanese as inflation. Japanese leaders know inflation is more fearful than recession, for it is the one thing that could destabilize the country. What politicians and economists alike need to worry about is what is to be done when the world's second-largest economy is destabilized.

HEADLINE: House Votes to Block F.D.A. On Approval of Abortion Pill

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
In an affirmation of its anti-abortion stance, the House voted today to block the Food and Drug Administration from approving an abortion-inducing pill.
The agency in 1996 had deemed the pill, RU-486, safe and effective and allowed its use in limited, tightly controlled studies. But it has not given final approval for general use. 
 Abortion opponents described the measure as a way to prevent the use of taxpayer dollars to further the killing of unborn children; abortion-rights advocates said the measure, which was attached to an agriculture appropriations bill, was a circuitous way to try to prevent women from having any kind of abortion, even one that they say is the earliest, safest and least invasive.
The effect of today's House action -- on a relatively close vote of 223 to 202 -- is unclear. The measure came to public attention with so little advance notice that its sponsor, Representative Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma and an obstetrician, said he was still looking for someone to introduce it in the Senate.
The Senate, even under Republican control, has been more supportive of abortion rights than the House. But if a similar measure did pass the Senate, it would present President Clinton with a political dilemma, and neither side would predict today what he might do.
Mr. Clinton, who supports abortion rights, has supported the advancement of RU-486 in the past. But opposing this measure would also mean vetoing the broader, politically appealing $56 billion agriculture bill. The bill provides $23 billion in food stamps, $609 million for food-safety inspection and $2 billion for rural economic projects. It also helps wheat farmers by exempting them from sanctions on India and Pakistan for exploding nuclear devices and protects subsidies for sugar processors and peanut farmers.
Joe Lockhart, a spokesman for Mr. Clinton, said the Administration opposed the bill. He said it would allow Congress to intervene in the drug-safety standards of the Food and Drug Administration. But Mr. Lockhart stopped short of saying the President would veto the measure.
"We're early in the process," he said, suggesting the Senate would scrap the measure.
Still, supporters of abortion rights were concerned that Mr. Clinton could waver on this matter because he is under political pressure on so many other fronts.
"This White House needs to issue a strong veto message immediately," said Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of Westchester County and a leading defender in the House of abortion rights.
While Mr. Clinton has stood firm in allowing a procedure that abortion opponents call partial-birth abortion, the Administration has sent signals that Mr. Clinton could side with the Republicans on another anti-abortion measure moving through the House. That bill would make it a crime for anyone to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion. Mr. Clinton's chief of staff, Erskine B. Bowles, recently wrote a letter to Congress saying that the President would support the measure if it were properly drafted.
And the difficulty of opposing the entire agriculture bill because it contains anti-abortion language was demonstrated by the House. The bill passed 373 to 48. It was opposed by 23 Republicans and 25 Democrats.
Many of the Republicans voting against the larger bill were conservatives who objected to other parts of it like the farm subsidies, which they perceive as corporate welfare.
Douglas Johnson, a lobbyist for the National Right to Life Committee, said today's passage was important because it mattered so much to "the abortion industry."
Mr. Coburn's measure would prohibit the Food and Drug Administration from using taxpayer money to test, develop or approve any drug for the chemical inducement of abortion.
"The business of the F.D.A. is to protect lives, not to facilitate death," Mr. Coburn said in the floor debate.
The agency has approved RU-486, generically called mifepristone, for research purposes. But no manufacturer has said it wants to make the drug on a large scale for general use. That has held up final F.D.A. approval, which requires inspections of laboratories and other actions that cannot take place until someone starts making it.
The Population Council, a nonprofit group in New York, has been working to bring mifepristone to the American market through private investors called the Danco Group.
Heather O'Neill, a spokeswoman for Danco, said today that Danco had identified a manufacturer "willing and able" to make the drug but she would not name it. Nor would she say whether the company was actually producing the drug yet but she said the drug would be available next year. She said the group was "horrified" by today's House action but was moving ahead to bring the drug to the general market anyway.
Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said that the House blockage of the food and drug agency process "came from left field" and that her organization had not had a chance to discuss it yet with the Clinton Administration. But she was by no means certain the President would veto it.
Later today the House approved a $250.5 billion military spending plan providing personnel with a 3.1 percent pay increase and new weaponry but not the $1.9 billion Mr. Clinton wanted for American forces in Bosnia, Reuters reported.
 The House passed the package by a 358-to-61 vote, providing $3 billion more than is being spent on the military but $271 million less than the Clinton budget request. A Senate military spending bill readied for floor consideration also does not provide money for Bosnia.
 Bill Young, Republican of Florida, a leading lawmaker on military matters said the money was omitted because the Administration had never explained the American policy for Bosnia.

HEADLINE: Birds in the Bush and the Database

BYLINE: By LES LINE 

 BODY:
HEY, I just entered my sightings from my last trip, and Avisys says I hit 100 birds for the year from the train," Mike Savage recently announced to members of his on-line bird-watching community.
"We were stopped at a red signal along the Great Salt Lake," continued Mr. Savage, a train engineer in the West for Union Pacific who spots birds from the cabs of the 400,000-pound, yellow-and-gray locomotives he drives. "I raised my binos to scan the shore, where I had willet, lesser yellowlegs and greater yellowlegs (No. 99) together in one view. The greater was a new train bird for me and was quickly followed by No. 100, a black-bellied plover, also a new train bird." 
 Train birds? For the uninitiated, bird-watchers (or "birders" as the serious ones call themselves) tend to be compulsive list-keepers. They keep lists of bird species seen in places like their yards, counties, states. They keep trip lists, seasonal lists, annual lists and life lists, which are all the birds seen in one's lifetime. And Mr. Savage keeps what has to be the most unusual list of all.
As a bird-watcher in the 1990's, he also keeps his birding lists on a Hewlett-Packard palmtop computer loaded with Avisys software, which was written for birders by a birder. Other bird-watchers frequently use other aids, like a global positioning system device to help them know where they are -- not to mention such sophisticated devices as a high-end Sony cassette tape deck with a parabolic microphone for recording and playing back songs to lure recalcitrant birds out of vegetation and into the open.
Time was when a life list was kept with penciled check marks next to columns of bird names arranged in taxonomic order -- loons first, sparrows last -- in the front of a field guide by Roger Tory Peterson.
There were pocket checklists on folded cardboard, not pocket computers, for recording the species seen on special trips to national parks or wildlife refuges. And notes about observations in the field were kept in a notebook of the paper-carrying variety, not one with an Intel chip aboard.
Time was when binoculars were the only hardware a birder carried. They were bulky, heavy and costly field glasses, often military surplus. If you were in a group birding from the edge of a marsh, someone probably had a spotting scope that provided a fuzzy view of ducks in the distance.
Times certainly have changed in the world of bird-watching, a pursuit that red-blooded outdoorsmen once derided as a hobby for little old ladies in tennis shoes. One company alone, Bushnell, markets more than 80 models of binoculars in a wide price range, while Carl Zeiss offers a technological breakthrough: a 20-power spotting scope that weighs only 42 ounces and can be held and focused with one hand.
The scope's optical components are mounted on a mechanical suspension system that eliminates a shaky image from hand movement (although the suggested price tag, $2,995, might cause a quiver or two). There is also a large choice of night vision binoculars and scopes for watching the nocturnal activities of whippoorwills and owls.
And that's just a start. "There's a real need for birding Sherpas," Dr. Arie Gilbert said as he hefted an enormous duffle bag into the back of a friend's mini-van one day not long ago for a morning of birding along the Housatonic River near Kent, Conn.
Dr. Gilbert, a Queens chiropractor and hard-core birder since his high school days, totes a load of equipment: Leica 10x42 rubber-armored binoculars, among the ne plus ultra of birding optics; a Minolta 35-millimeter autofocus camera with a 500-millimeter telephoto lens for documenting unusual sightings; a Kowa zoom spotting scope and a heavy Bogen tripod to support it; a Sony tape deck with parabolic microphone, and often a laptop computer with a Global Positioning System receiver and DeLorme's Street Atlas program for navigating to and around unfamiliar areas. Oh, and yes, somewhere in the bag there's a Peterson field guide.
Another high-tech birder is Mr. Savage, a 42-year-old Union Pacific engineer from West Jordan, Utah, who hauls a hundred or more freight cars on a 264-mile run between Salt Lake City and Elko, Nev. The tracks cross the Great Salt Lake Desert, climb the Pequop Mountains and descend into the Humboldt River Valley -- a spectacular range of wildlife habitats where the train passes through just two towns and there are very few cars for the driver to worry about. So Mr. Savage never leaves for work without binoculars and his computer. "It's a good thing I don't have to steer," he quipped.
Other birders carry handheld G.P.S receivers like Garmin's G.P.S. III. They track unmarked trails and update printouts from Toposcout CD-ROM's that contain all of the United States Geological Survey topographic maps for their state.
The laptop computers plugged into their car-lighter sockets are likely to be loaded with an audio CD with the vocalizations of nearly every North American bird species, along with a program called Avisys Song that enables a fast comparison of similar songs by very different birds, like the worm-eating warbler and the chipping sparrow.
What Dr. Gilbert didn't bring along was a cellular phone, which Ann Johnson, vice president of the Iowa Ornithologists' Union and Web master of the Iowa Birding site on the Internet, considers essential for live updates to and from friends as she runs around the countryside near Des Moines on Saturdays.
Cellular phones also let birders quickly report sightings to any of the dozens of Rare Bird Alert telephone hot lines around the country. These bird-alert reports are also available on the Internet, but they are usually updated weekly. For the truly fanatical, the Houston Audubon Society offers a subscription reporting service on rare birds in the United States and Canada. In addition to Internet access to sightings and directions, it offers a "We Call You" service; birders who need certain species for their North American lists get a call if one of them -- or a bird new to the continent -- is reported.
There are quite a few takers. A study on the economic impact of wildlife watching, released this month by the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service, said 17.7 million Americans took bird-watching trips in 1996.
A subset of those millions are the men and women who aspire to the exclusive 700 Club and 800 Club, limited to birders who have seen more than 700 or 800 of the 914 bird species north of the Mexican border.
In Britain, birders in dire need of "twitches," sightings of rare species, may rely on pagers for breaking news. "A typical twitcher will be searching around when a message like 'great auk on Outer Hebrides' comes on," said John Farrar, a British trade union official in South Yorkshire. "The twitcher will drop everything, apart from his or her scope and credit card, and charge off north." Of course, the great auk, a giant penguinlike ocean bird, was last seen in 1844. But that's the general idea.
Like his American counterparts, Mr. Farrar carries a handheld computer to record sightings on Avisys, a Windows database system devised by Jerry Blinn, who was a programmer turned manager before he retired from International Business Machines and wrote Avisys. Mr. Blinn, definitely a serious birder, markets the software and its companion, Avisys Song, through his company, Perceptive Systems in Silverdale, Wash.
"Birders have an insatiable appetite for data on what they've seen, where they saw it and why," Mr. Blinn said. "They want a program where they record the habitat, the weather, the bird's behavior, even unbelievable stuff like cloacal swelling."
Many birders' databases can be viewed on personal pages on the Web. That's a new way to brag about one's life list -- but the sites are also a useful place to find information if you need to know the arrival dates of spring migrants, for instance, in a particular area. Across the Internet, there is enough information about birds to keep a watcher indoors for a month, including the huge Breeding Bird Survey database at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland. Other pages offer mnemonics to help birders remember songs and calls, like "look-up, over-here, see-me, up-here" for the red-eyed vireo; sound files for 51 Brazilian birds, and the insane song of the laughing kookaburra, an Australian kingfisher.
Elsewhere on the Web, through satellite tracking, it is possible to follow a Laysan albatross's 90-day, 25,000-mile round trip over the North Pacific to find food for its chick. Web cameras focus on nesting peregrine falcons in Seattle, white storks in Germany and tree swallows at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology in Ithaca, N.Y. In partnership with the National Audubon Society, the Lab (as birders know it) offers nonscientists the opportunity to "bird with a purpose" by participating in on-line projects like Warbler Watch. The Web page of the Gay Birders Club in England "enables contact between gay and lesbian bird-watchers worldwide." And if your E-mail box isn't full, you can subscribe to any of some 60 specialized mailing lists on subjects like seabirds, cavity-nesting birds, hummingbirds or Turkey's birds. The Web supersite that has Internet links galore is (what else?) called Birding (birding.miningco.com).
Or you can grab a beat-up Peterson guide and binoculars worn to the bare metal by years of heavy use, leave all the high-tech gizmos at home and go on what Dr. Gilbert calls "a treasure hunt," watching the activities of the most common birds, like the American robin, for half an hour without worrying about peer pressure to run up the day's score. Dr. Gilbert said, "That's the fun part of birding."

Optical Power
A Handful of Viewing Power
FOR bird-watchers, power means power. Higher-powered optics make birds appear closer so they can be identified through the field marks that, for example, distinguish a lesser yellowlegs from a greater yellowlegs. Those differences are often subtle: The greater yellowlegs has a long, slightly upturned bill and thicker leg joints, while the lesser yellowlegs has a straight bill. If you see the two shorebirds side by side, the lesser is noticeably smaller, but otherwise it's a tough call.
Ten-power binoculars deliver the highest magnification that is practical for handheld viewing -- if you have steady hands -- but many bird-watchers, especially women, prefer 7X or 8X models. If you want to view an oriole in the top of a shade tree in your yard, binoculars are all you will need for a good look and a confident check mark on your list.
But wetlands birds, like loons, ducks, gulls, sandpipers and herons, as well as birds of prey, are typically seen at a distance. That is when a spotting scope is useful. Models that zoom from 15X to 45X or from 20X to 60X are popular among birders, but a sturdy tripod is needed to keep the image from jiggling. Even then, if there is a stiff wind, you can get queasy from a tremor in the image that increases along with the magnification.
Trying to hold a spotting scope in your hand, even at the lowest magnification, is futile. Or at least it was until Carl Zeiss, the famous German optical company, adapted 16th-century technology and introduced a 20-power stabilized monocular/scope that can be comfortably held and focused in one hand. With the press of a button, the image becomes sharp and rock-steady.
The military has used high-power gyro-stabilized binoculars for decades, notably on ships at sea, but they are heavy and require a power source. Further, the gyro takes time to spool up to speed, and a power source, like a battery pack, is required. And the gyro's whine, while inaudible to humans, spooks wildlife.
The stability of the Zeiss 20x60S depends on mechanical ingenuity, not electronics. There isn't one circuit inside the light, ergonomically contoured and water-resistant housing of the scope, which weighs just 42 ounces. Rather, the scope's prism, which is required for image reversal, is mounted in a suspension system that moves left, right or down with the user's hand so the incoming light rays always fall on the same image plane. Any vibrations caused by hand tremors are mechanically suppressed.
For some bird-watchers, a drawback of the Zeiss stabilized monocular is its suggested retail price: $2,999.95. If your pockets are deep and you prefer a 20-power stabilized binocular, which is heavier and not so slick to use in the field, Zeiss has that, too -- for $4,999.95.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE APPEAL;
EX-CHINESE LEADER CONFRONTS BEIJING ON 1989 MASSACRE

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Thursday, June 25

 BODY:
Zhao Ziyang, who was ousted as Communist Party chief at the time of the crackdown in Tiananmen Square in 1989, has challenged the nation's leaders to admit that the incident was not only reprehensible but also an immense political blunder.
Mr. Zhao, who has been under house arrest for nine years, made his case in a letter to the party's Central Committee by arguing that President Clinton's visit to China, which begins today, offered a chance to reverse the official verdict on the massacre that bloodied the streets of Beijing and deeply scarred the nation's conscience. The Communist Party has insisted that the Government had to call in the military to quell a "counter-revolutionary rebellion." 
 For a former Communist Party leader to so openly confront the leadership, and on such a sensitive political issue, is extraordinary in China. Yet it may reflect Mr. Zhao's confidence that the party's position is squarely on the wrong side of history, and that the vast majority of Chinese people agree with him.
By trying to provoke debate in the party on the events of June 4, 1989, when the military killed hundreds of demonstrators after seven weeks of protests in Tiananmen Square, Mr. Zhao has also risked further punishment. Two former officials who know Mr. Zhao, and who attested to the letter's authenticity, said he intended that it be both read by party leaders and circulated in Beijing.
"Now we are facing the arrival of a new open, democratic and information-age era," Mr. Zhao wrote in the letter, which was published today by the Reuters news agency. "What reason do we have to reject the will of the people, cling to the June 4 problem and block our road to democratic politics? The trend of democracy cannot be blocked."
In contrast with previous fallen leaders in China, Mr. Zhao has steadfastly refused to admit wrongdoing, apparently calculating that creating some distance between himself and his successors can leave the door open to a possible return to power, should the current leadership falter.
No liberal when in power, Mr. Zhao was fast losing influence when students erupted in protest in the spring of 1989, and he painted himself as sympathetic to their cause as a way to try to save his own career.
Whether a pragmatic politician or a cynical one, he now uses his opposition to the crackdown as his greatest weapon. His supporters make the case with eloquent simplicity.
"Resolving the June 4 question is a common desire of all Chinese people," said Bao Tong, Mr. Zhao's chief aide for many years, who spent seven years in prison after 1989. "Political reform is the biggest issue in China today. It begins with June 4."
When Mr. Clinton arrives in China, landing in Xian tonight and then proceeding to Beijing on Friday, he will follow an itinerary designed to accentuate the nonpolitical side of life in China. Meeting teachers, lawyers and entrepreneurs, he is expecting to celebrate the ever-greater degree of personal freedom in the private affairs of ordinary Chinese.
Yet Mr. Zhao's letter, and even the mere mention of his name, is a pointed reminder of the authoritarian and secretive system that still reigns, sharply restricting political freedom.
Mr. Zhao's case is not a typical one. Held under tight security for nine years, he has never been charged with a crime. His real offense was to lose in the high-stakes poker of Communist Party politics at a time of crisis in 1989, and to refuse to go quietly.
By contrast, Mr. Zhao's rival and predecessor as Communist Party chief, Hu Yaobang, took a much more conciliatory stance after he was dumped in January 1987. By accepting criticism and promising obedience to his successor, Mr. Hu retained a seat on the Politburo until he died in April 1989, the spark for demonstrations by students who used his death as an excuse to protest Government shortcomings.
Yet Mr. Zhao has also retained his membership in the Communist Party, and under the sometimes arcane rules that guide China's ruling elite, that allows him certain privileges, like access to internal documents, even as he is deprived of other more basic rights, like freedom of speech and movement.
Mr. Zhao lives with his wife in a spacious home on a small alley near the Forbidden City in Beijing, and not far from Zhongnanhai, the compound where China's leaders live and work. He can receive select, pre-approved visitors, and often sees his daughter and two sons.
Said to suffer from mild heart trouble, he has occasionally been allowed to play golf, a sport he became passionate about during his rise to power on the coattails of Deng Xiaoping in the 1980's. Every time Mr. Zhao wants to leave Beijing, he must apply directly to President Jiang Zemin, who personally decides.
In recent years, Mr. Zhao has spent many winter months in the resort city of Hangzhou, where he is believed to have been in February 1997, when Deng died. Mr. Zhao applied to Mr. Jiang for permission to return immediately to Beijing and attend Deng's memorial service, but Mr. Jiang turned down the request, eager to establish himself as the sole heir to Deng and evidently still threatened by Mr. Zhao's reputation as a capable economic reformer.
Although Chinese leaders generally try to avoid public discussion of the Tiananmen incident, the issue weighs heavily on top-level party politics and has been repeatedly debated at internal meetings, as Prime Minister Zhu Rongji recently confirmed.
At a news conference in March, Mr. Zhu was asked about the Tiananmen incident. He appeared to offer the party line in response.
"In recent years, every major meeting of our party and Government has drawn a correct conclusion regarding that matter, and that conclusion can not be changed," the Prime Minister said.
Yet careful listeners noticed that, inadvertently or not, Mr. Zhu's comment revealed that at "every major meeting," the Tiananmen incident had to reaffirmed.
"In my experience, only if an issue is raised will it be reaffirmed," Mr. Bao, Mr. Zhao's former aide, said. "That means there are different views. Otherwise there would be no need to discuss it."
In his letter, Mr. Zhao uses the issue of China-United States relations to call for a reappraisal of the June 4 incident, which he calls "one of the biggest human rights issues in this century."
"President Clinton's visit to China marks a turn for the better in Sino-U.S. relations," Mr. Zhao wrote. "But the United States and the whole of the West have again and again raised the issue of June 4 and the issue of human rights in China.
"Rather than let it become an obstacle to international relations, it would be better to resolve the issue of June 4 ourselves, voluntarily."

Although specific issues at the summit meeting in Beijing on Saturday will range from trade and the Asian financial crisis to human rights and Taiwan, a high priority of Mr. Clinton's trip, which follows the state visit by President Jiang Zemin of China to the United States last fall, is to bring greater stability to what has been a turbulent relationship between the two countries.

HEADLINE: Growth Rate Of Economy Is Revised Up, To Brisk 5.4%

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
The economy grew much more quickly than originally believed during the first three months of this year, with businesses and consumers increasing spending at a rapid rate, the Government said today.
The nation's gross domestic product -- the sum of all goods and services produced within United States borders -- increased at a seasonally adjusted 5.4 percent annual rate during the period from January to March, the Commerce Department said in a revision of its 4.8 percent estimate a month ago. 
 But much of the latest growth spurt also came from a buildup in business inventories, which is already slowing growth in the current quarter because manufacturers are cutting back production while they sell the stockpiled goods. The inventory buildup rose by a record $105.7 billion in the first quarter.
A further possible sign of economic weakness emerged today in a separate report from the Labor Department that showed a surge in unemployment that reflected the General Motors strike that started three weeks ago.
First-time applications for unemployment benefits jumped by 34,000 last week to 364,000, the highest level in nearly a year. Many of the new claims came in Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, New York and Ohio, states where G.M. manufactures.
In a sign of the economy's strength, however, the National Association of Realtors said today that sales of existing single-family homes rose 1 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.82 million. That is just short of March's record pace of 4.89 million homes and leaves sales on a pace to set a record for the full year.

HEADLINE: Not So Easy to Sell Saks Fifth Avenue

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
To the average New York shopper, Saks Fifth Avenue might seem like the ultimate acquisition.
There is the landmark name. The chic frocks. Tourists from around the world flock to buy anything bearing the store's logo. A first trip to Saks in search of a bridal gown or lipstick is a rite of passage for New Yorkers who regard shopping as a serious sport. 
 But for the average investment bank actually trying to sell the retail legend, name and cachet do not so easily equal a deal.
Saks Holdings Inc., the holding company for the retailer, said yesterday that its board, as expected, had approved a sale or merger of the company, and retained Goldman, Sachs & Company and Merrill Lynch & Company to assist. An acquisition or merger of the 97-store chain would end the ownership of Investcorp International, the Bahrain-based investment bank, which holds the majority stake in the retailer. Saks was bought by Investcorp in 1990 for $1.6 billion, and the company sold 20 percent of Saks to the public in 1995 for $25 a share, or $425 million.
Most retail analysts and investment bankers will not discuss potential buyers, largely because they are hoping to get some banking business of their own from one. But all the potential acquirers are known to them because the department store universe has gotten increasingly small as stores like B. Altman have closed and others like Macy's have fallen under the umbrella of giant chains like Federated Department Stores Inc.
Federated, which owns Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Sterns and several other chains, would seem like the biggest player in the game. But the fit does not seem perfect. Federated has been focusing on every place except New York in recent years, rolling out Bloomingdale's in California and eyeing potential acquisitions in the Midwest, where it has no presence.
Further, the chairman of Saks, Philip B. Miller, has taken the store on an interesting strategic journey. Mr. Miller tossed out the clothing lines that are the bread and butter of Federated stores, like Liz Claiborne, in favor of pricier lines like Dolce & Gabbana. The move increased sales for Saks, but it also means that the store has little in common with Federated or the giant May Department Stores Company, which owns Lord & Taylor, another store less snazzy than Saks.
Then, there is Nordstrom Inc. "It would be a real step up for them," said Walter Loeb, the retail consultant. "It would give them greater access to name brands." But shares of Nordstrom are held largely by the retailer's founding family, and it seems unlikely that they would be willing to do a stock transaction to acquire Saks.
No one knows, of course, how much Saks could fetch, but luxury retailers tend to be valued at roughly eight-tenths to one and a half times revenues, which would put the price for Saks roughly between $1.8 billion and $2.5 billion. Few retail companies have that kind of cash. Further, supplier synergies would be limited, especially since Nordstrom has a totally decentralized regional buying structure.
Neiman Marcus, a unit of Harcourt General, is another potential buyer. The two companies sell similar high-end merchandise and have similar customers. They have been stomping around each other's territory for a few years -- Saks has gone into Houston and Dallas, Neiman has opened stores recently on the East Coast -- and have privately expressed interest in each other in the past.
But if the two were to get together, could an antitrust argument result? Outside of Barneys New York, which is tiny compared with those two, and dozens of small specialty stores around the country, Saks and Neiman are truly the only national outlets for the Giorgio Armani and Jil Sander's lines. Mr. Miller has also put an emphasis on scaled-down Saks in small cities, like Greenwich, Conn., further tightening the retailer's grip on the luxury market.
"If manufacturers feel they benefit from bargaining one of these stores against the other," said Richard M. Steuer, an antitrust lawyer at Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler, "they would have the kind of argument the Government would listen to."
Mr. Steuer pointed to the scuttled merger between Staples Inc. and Office Depot Inc. last year, a union the Government found a threat to free trade. "Even though this takes the issue from the mundane to the sublime, the question of their ability to have a lock on a certain universe of sellers remains," he said.
International retailers are another option. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton is said to have already looked and moved on. Dickson Concepts Inc. has been badly hammered because of the Asian recession. Harrods Department Store in London is a good possibility.
And there is always the possibility that Saks executives could try to raise enough cash to buy the retailer outright.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT;
Excerpts From Opinions in Ruling on the Extent of Lawyer-Client Privilege

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from today's Supreme Court decision that the lawyer-client privilege survives the death of the client. The opinion in the case, Swidler & Berlin and James Hamilton v. United States, was written by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. A dissenting opinion, which is also excerpted below, was filed by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
 
FROM THE DECISION
By Justice Rehnquist
This dispute arises out of an investigation conducted by the office of the independent counsel into whether various individuals made false statements, obstructed justice, or committed other crimes during investigations of the 1993 dismissal of employees from the White House travel office. Vincent W. Foster Jr. was deputy White House counsel when the firings occurred. In July 1993, Foster met with petitioner James Hamilton, an attorney at petitioner Swidler Berlin, to seek legal representation concerning possible Congressional or other investigations of the firings. During a two-hour meeting, Hamilton took three pages of handwritten notes. One of the first entries in the notes is the word "privileged." Nine days later, Foster committed suicide. 
 In December 1995, a Federal grand jury, at the request of the independent counsel, issued subpoenas to petitioners Hamilton and Swidler Berlin for, inter alia, Hamilton's handwritten notes of his meeting with Foster. Petitioners filed a motion to quash, arguing that the notes were protected by the attorney-client privilege and by the work product privilege. The District Court, after examining the notes in camera, concluded they were protected from disclosure by both doctrines and denied enforcement of the subpoenas.
The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed. . . .
The attorney-client privilege is one of the oldest recognized privileges for confidential communications. The privilege is intended to encourage "full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and the administration of justice." The issue presented here is the scope of that privilege; more particularly, the extent to which the privilege survives the death of the client. Our interpretation of the privilege's scope is guided by "the principles of the common law as interpreted by the courts in the light of reason and experience." Federal Rules of Evidence 501.
The independent counsel argues that the attorney-client privilege should not prevent disclosure of confidential communications where the client has died and the information is relevant to a criminal proceeding. There is some authority for this position. One state appellate court and the Court of Appeals below have held the privilege may be subject to posthumous exceptions in certain circumstances. . . .
But other than these two decisions, cases addressing the existence of the privilege after death most involving the testamentary exception uniformly presume the privilege survives, even if they do not so hold. . . .
The great body of this case law supports, either by holding or considered dicta, the position that the privilege does survive in a case such as the present one. Given the language of Rule 501, at the very least the burden is on the independent counsel to show that "reason and experience" require a departure from this rule.
The independent counsel contends that the testamentary exception supports the posthumous termination of the privilege because in practice most cases have refused to apply the privilege posthumously. He further argues that the exception reflects a policy judgment that the interest in settling estates outweighs any posthumous interest in confidentiality. He then reasons by analogy that in criminal proceedings, the interest in determining whether a crime has been committed should trump client confidentiality, particularly since the financial interests of the estate are not at stake.
But the independent counsel's interpretation simply does not square with the case law's implicit acceptance of the privilege's survival and with the treatment of testamentary disclosure as an "exception" or an implied "waiver." And the premise of his analogy is incorrect, since cases consistently recognize that the rationale for the testamentary exception is that it furthers the client's intent. There is no reason to suppose as a general matter that grand jury testimony about confidential communications furthers the client's intent. . . .
We think there are weighty reasons that counsel in favor of posthumous application. Knowing that communications will remain confidential even after death encourages the client to communicate fully and frankly with counsel. While the fear of disclosure, and the consequent withholding of information from counsel, may be reduced if disclosure is limited to posthumous disclosure in a criminal context, it seems unreasonable to assume that it vanishes altogether. Clients may be concerned about reputation, civil liability, or possible harm to friends or family. Posthumous disclosure of such communications may be as feared as disclosure during the client's lifetime.
The independent counsel suggests, however, that his proposed exception would have little to no effect on the client's willingness to confide in his attorney. He reasons that only clients intending to perjure themselves will be chilled by a rule of disclosure after death, as opposed to truthful clients or those asserting their Fifth Amendment privilege. This is because for the latter group, communications disclosed by the attorney after the client's death purportedly will reveal only information that the client himself would have revealed if alive.
The independent counsel assumes, incorrectly we believe, that the privilege is analogous to the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination. But as suggested above, the privilege serves much broader purposes. Clients consult attorneys for a wide variety of reasons, only one of which involves possible criminal liability. Many attorneys act as counselors on personal and family matters, where, in the course of obtaining the desired advice, confidences about family members or financial problems must be revealed in order to assure sound legal advice. The same is true of owners of small businesses who may regularly consult their attorneys about a variety of problems arising in the course of the business. These confidences may not come close to any sort of admission of criminal wrongdoing, but nonetheless be matters which the client would not wish divulged.
The contention that the attorney is being required to disclose only what the client could have been required to disclose is at odds with the basis for the privilege even during the client's lifetime. In related cases, we have said that the loss of evidence admittedly caused by the privilege is justified in part by the fact that without the privilege, the client may not have made such communications in the first place. This is true of disclosure before and after the client's death. Without assurance of the privilege's posthumous application, the client may very well not have made disclosures to his attorney at all, so the loss of evidence is more apparent than real. In the case at hand, it seems quite plausible that Foster, perhaps already contemplating suicide, may not have sought legal advice from Hamilton if he had not been assured the conversation was privileged.
The independent counsel additionally suggests that his proposed exception would have minimal impact if confined to criminal cases, or, as the Court of Appeals suggests, if it is limited to information of substantial importance to a particular criminal case. However, there is no case authority for the proposition that the privilege applies differently in criminal and civil cases. . . .
In any event, a client may not know at the time he discloses information to his attorney whether it will later be relevant to a civil or a criminal matter, let alone whether it will be of substantial importance. Balancing ex post the importance of the information against client interests, even limited to criminal cases, introduces substantial uncertainty into the privilege's application. For just that reason, we have rejected use of a balancing test in defining the contours of the privilege.
In a similar vein, the independent counsel argues that existing exceptions to the privilege, such as the crime-fraud exception and the testamentary exception, make the impact of one more exception marginal. However, these exceptions do not demonstrate that the impact of a posthumous exception would be insignificant, and there is little empirical evidence on this point. The established exceptions are consistent with the purposes of the privilege, while a posthumous exception in criminal cases appears at odds with the goals of encouraging full and frank communication and of protecting the client's interests. A "no-harm-in-one-more-exception" rationale could contribute to the general erosion of the privilege, without reference to common law principles or "reason and experience." . . .
It has been generally, if not universally, accepted, for well over a century, that the attorney-client privilege survives the death of the client in a case such as this. While the arguments against the survival of the privilege are by no means frivolous, they are based in large part on speculation, thoughtful speculation, but speculation nonetheless as to whether posthumous termination of the privilege would diminish a client's willingness to confide in an attorney. In an area where empirical information would be useful, it is scant and inconclusive.
Rule 501's direction to look to "the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience" does not mandate that a rule, once established, should endure for all time. But here the independent counsel has simply not made a sufficient showing to overturn the common-law rule embodied in the prevailing case law. Interpreted in the light of reason and experience, that body of law requires that the attorney-client privilege prevent disclosure of the notes at issue in this case.
 
FROM THE DISSENT
By Justice O'Connor
 Although the attorney-client privilege ordinarily will survive the death of the client, I do not agree with the Court that it inevitably precludes disclosure of a deceased client's communications in criminal proceedings. In my view, a criminal defendant's right to exculpatory evidence or a compelling law enforcement need for information may, where the testimony is not available from other sources, override a client's posthumous interest in confidentiality.
We have long recognized that " t he fundamental basis upon which all rules of evidence must rest if they are to rest upon reason is their adaptation to the successful development of the truth." In light of the heavy burden that they place on the search for truth, see United States v. Nixon (1974), " e videntiary privileges in litigation are not favored, and even those rooted in the Constitution must give way in proper circumstances." Consequently, we construe the scope of privileges narrowly. We are reluctant to recognize a privilege or read an existing one expansively unless to do so will serve a "public good transcending the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth."
The attorney-client privilege promotes trust in the representational relationship, thereby facilitating the provision of legal services and ultimately the administration of justice. The systemic benefits of the privilege are commonly understood to outweigh the harm caused by excluding critical evidence. A privilege should operate, however, only where "necessary to achieve its purpose," and an invocation of the attorney-client privilege should not go unexamined "when it is shown that the interests of the administration of justice can only be frustrated by its exercise."
I agree that a deceased client may retain a personal, reputational and economic interest in confidentiality. But, after death, the potential that disclosure will harm the client's interests has been greatly diminished, and the risk that the client will be held criminally liable has abated altogether. . . .
This diminished risk is coupled with a heightened urgency for discovery of a deceased client's communications in the criminal context. The privilege does not "protect disclosure of the underlying facts by those who communicated with the attorney," and were the client living, prosecutors could grant immunity and compel the relevant testimony. After a client's death, however, if the privilege precludes an attorney from testifying in the client's stead, a complete "loss of crucial information" will often result.
As the Court of Appeals observed, the costs of recognizing an absolute posthumous privilege can be inordinately high. Extreme injustice may occur, for example, where a criminal defendant seeks disclosure of a deceased client's confession to the offense. In my view, the paramount value that our criminal justice system places on protecting an innocent defendant should outweigh a deceased client's interest in preserving confidences. Indeed, even petitioner acknowledges that an exception may be appropriate where the constitutional rights of a criminal defendant are at stake.
An exception may likewise be warranted in the face of a compelling law enforcement need for the information. " O ur historic commitment to the rule of law is nowhere more profoundly manifest than in our view that the twofold aim of criminal justice is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer."
Given that the complete exclusion of relevant evidence from a criminal trial or investigation may distort the record, mislead the fact finder, and undermine the central truth-seeking function of the courts, I do not believe that the attorney-client privilege should act as an absolute bar to the disclosure of a deceased client's communications. When the privilege is asserted in the criminal context, and a showing is made that the communications at issue contain necessary factual information not otherwise available, courts should be permitted to assess whether interests in fairness and accuracy outweigh the justifications for the privilege. . . .
In the situation where the posthumous privilege most frequently arises, a dispute between heirs over the decedent's will, the privilege is widely recognized to give way to the interest in settling the estate. This testamentary exception, moreover, may be invoked in some cases where the decedent would not have chosen to waive the privilege. For example, "a decedent might want to provide for an illegitimate child but at the same time much prefer that the relationship go undisclosed." Among the Court's rationales for a broad construction of the posthumous privilege is its assertion that " m any attorneys act as counselors on personal and family matters, where, in the course of obtaining the desired advice, confidences about family members or financial problems must be revealed . . . which the client would not wish divulged."
That reasoning, however, would apply in the testamentary context with equal force. Nor are other existing exceptions to the privilege for example, the crime-fraud exception or the exceptions for claims relating to attorney competence or compensation necessarily consistent with "encouraging full and frank communication" or "protecting the client's interests." Rather, those exceptions reflect the understanding that, in certain circumstances, the privilege "ceases to operate" as a safeguard on "the proper functioning of our adversary system." . . .
Where the exoneration of an innocent criminal defendant or a compelling law enforcement interest is at stake, the harm of precluding critical evidence that is unavailable by any other means outweighs the potential disincentive to forthright communication. In my view, the cost of silence warrants a narrow exception to the rule that the attorney-client privilege survives the death of the client.

HEADLINE: Iran Rejects Overtures By Albright

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, June 25

 BODY:
Iran today reiterated its rejection of a political dialogue with the United States, as a Deputy Foreign Minister praised the Clinton Administration for softening its hostile tone but sharply criticized Washington for not abandoning its punitive policies against his country.
In an interview, the minister, Mohammed Javad Zarif, offered the most detailed official Iranian reaction to a speech last week by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright calling on the Iranian Government to help formulate a "road map" to normal relations. 
 "We see a move at least in rhetoric on the part of the United States to better understand the realities of the Islamic Republic as well as of our region," Mr. Zarif said. But, he added, "Where it matters, where it will be taken seriously by Iran -- regarding the policies of the United States, the behavior of the United States -- we see the remnants of a cold war mentality."
Among other issues, Mr. Zarif cited the continuation of an American trade embargo against Iran and American opposition to the building of a pipeline through Iran to transport oil from the Caspian Sea as proof of American ill will toward his country.
Mr. Zarif, who studied at Columbia University and San Francisco State University and holds a Ph.D. in international relations from the University of Denver, served as a diplomat at the United Nations for nine years and is known for his conciliatory tone, even when it comes to discussing the United States.
His remarks amplified those made by Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi in Spain last week in which he said that if the United States is serious in improving relations with Iran, it must prove it with "facts."
Neither President Mohammad Khatami nor Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has reacted publicly to Ms. Albright's speech, which was the result of long deliberations within the Administration.
Mohammed Ali Nateq Noori, the Speaker of the Parliament who was defeated by Mr. Khatami in last year's presidential election, did not refer to Ms. Albright's remarks in a speech on Tuesday, but said, "It is a mistake to imagine that America has given up mischief."
Iran is embroiled in a high-stakes political battle between supporters of Mr. Khatami, who has pushed for the creation of a civil society and the rule of law, and conservative supporters of Ayatollah Khamenei, who are determined to uphold revolutionary values. Improving relations with the United States is not high on the agenda.
In the interview, Mr. Zarif also faulted Ms. Albright for repeating charges against Iran that it sponsors terrorism and is developing a dangerous program of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles. "She made a big mistake, big mistake," Mr. Zarif said.
On the American call for an official dialogue between the two countries, Mr. Zarif said, "We don't believe that the behavior of the United States shows yet that it is ready for a dialogue based on mutual respect."
Privately, some Iranian officials have expressed concern that even if they proceed down the road with negotiations with the United States, they could end up empty-handed. Three years ago, Hashemi Rafsanjani, as President, said that the United States had missed a signal to improve relations with Iran when it forced the cancellation of a $1 billion deal that Iran had made with an American oil company.
Mr. Zarif acknowledged that even Iran's modest opening of the country to American scholars and political analysts had been criticized in news reports and in Parliament. "To put it mildly, there is a diversity of views regarding that exchange," he said.
Iran has rejected requests for visas by a number of American lawmakers and at least one former hostage who applied for a tourist visa, Iranian officials said.
Ms. Albright's remarks have reignited a debate in Iran's increasingly outspoken news outlets over policy toward the United States, with some newspapers voicing suspicion of the United States, while others suggest that improved relations with Washington are possible.
One sign that the mood in Teheran toward the United States is less uniformly hostile than it has been in the past came after Iran beat the United States in a World Cup soccer match last Sunday night.
In Vali Assr Square in central Teheran, a group of men raised an American flag and showered onlookers with leaflets denouncing the United States. As soon as the group began to set the flag on fire, it was pulled down into the crowd. Other onlookers tore up the leaflets.

HEADLINE: Peter T. Joseph, 47, Chairman Of Bank and Ballet, Is Dead

BYLINE: By ANNA KISSELGOFF 

 BODY:
Peter T. Joseph, chairman and chief executive officer of Rosecliff Inc., a merchant banking concern, and chairman of the board of American Ballet Theater, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 47.
The cause was cancer, said John Silberman, a family friend. 
 Mr. Joseph played a dominant role in the resurgence of Ballet Theater after a severe financial crisis threatened to shut the company down in 1993, shortly before he became chairman. He joined the board in 1991 and worked to restructure the company's finances and administration. His personal gift of $5 million did much to offset the company's debt and was intended to stimulate matching grants over several years. Michael Kaiser, whom Mr. Joseph recruited as Ballet Theater's executive director, reported this year that the debt had been eliminated.
As an art patron, Mr. Joseph had a special interest in hand-crafted furniture by American artists. He founded the Peter Joseph Gallery in Manhattan to sell and exhibit the work, known as studio furniture, of artists he admired. He also established the Peter T. Joseph Programming Endowment for the Furniture Design Department at the Rhode Island School of Design.
Mr. Joseph's philanthropic interests extended to a variety of causes supported by the Peter T. Joseph Foundation, which recently commissioned an outdoor sculpture by Richard Serra for Princeton University. Mr. Joseph was also on the boards of the Second Stage, a theater company, and Prep for Prep, which supports gifted minority students.
Mr. Joseph was born in Cincinnati and graduated from Princeton University, from which he received a master's degree in public affairs in 1973. He was assistant editor at New Times Magazine and published "Good Times: An Oral History of America in the 1960's" in this period. After graduating from Yale Law School in 1977, he started a tax and corporate practice before becoming a partner in Riordan & Joseph in Los Angeles.
He was one of two people responsible for investments by a $1 billion high-yield investment fund for the Bass Brothers, Drexel Burnham Lambert and the Equitable Life Assurance Society from 1984 to 1986. From 1986 to 1992 he was associated with the Robert Bass Group. From 1987 until his death he was head of Rosecliff Inc., which managed the capital of a select group of investors. Until 1992, he was managing general partner of Acadia Partners, with responsibility for managing a $1.7 billion portfolio.
Mr. Joseph is survived by his wife, Wendy Evans Joseph, an architect; a daughter, Danielle Eve, and a son, Nicholas Evan, both of New York City; his mother, Evelyn Joseph, of Cincinnati; two brothers, Thomas, of Cincinnati, and Michael, of Olney, Ill.; and five sisters, Evelyn Joseph of Cincinnati; Mary Nyod and Eleanor Joseph, both of Atlanta; Margaret Joseph of Nashville, Tenn., and Kathleen Reinhart of Dayton, Ohio.

Washington Lives in Two Different Worlds

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
At one end of Pennsylvania Avenue lies the U.S. Treasury building. At the other is the Capitol. They are not that far apart in miles, but they seem to inhabit different worlds. While the Treasury deals with the threat of financial hurricanes, the Congress legislates as if there were not a cloud in the sky.
Treasury officials have moved from one crisis to another, all stemming from the Asian woes. There have been alarms in Thailand, Korea, Indonesia, Russia and Japan, and there are worries about China, Hong Kong and Malaysia. 
 Disaster has been averted, but there are signs of a global slowdown. Japan's recession is official, and Hong Kong's will be, as soon as figures for the current quarter are compiled. A World Bank official talks about regional depression.
That, at least for now, is too harsh a view. But the pain for many is great, and is spreading. With economic activity on the decline in what had been the world's fastest-growing area, commodity prices have been falling. On average, commodities have lost about a quarter of their value since last fall, but some, notably oil, have gone down much more rapidly. Oil-producing countries this week agreed to cut production again in an effort to prop up prices, but that is unlikely to work, even if producing countries do not cheat on their production quotas, unless economic activity in Asia begins to pick up.
Throughout Asia, bankers are wondering why they made loans to borrowers who cannot repay. Crony capitalism and political pull explain some of the bad loans, but many can be traced to the exuberance and assurance that accompanies economic booms, which can make credit cheap and easy to get. Now the cycle has turned. Bankers are cautious and international investors are edging out. "The virulent Asian virus, in the form of capital flight, now has affected big developing countries like Russia, South Africa and Brazil," says Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's chief investment strategist.
But on Capitol Hill the picture couldn't be prettier. The American economy is booming and there is a budget surplus. Goodies are being given to favored constituents, in such forms as a pork-laden highway bill and cuts in capital gains taxes. Congressional leaders have agreed that the current low 20 percent rate should be made available to investors who sell after holding on for a year, rather than waiting 18 months. But Speaker Newt Gingrich thinks that is too modest, and wants to cut the rate to 15 percent. At the same time, the rules on retirement accounts are to be liberalized to make it possible for better-off Americans to escape taxation after retirement in return for paying some taxes now.
For now, the Asian problems have had a relatively small, and mixed, effect on this country. Our exports are falling, and our trade deficit has soared to record levels because the Asians can't afford to buy what they used to buy. The manufacturing sector is starting to feel the pinch. But capital is fleeing to the relative safety of this country, driving bond prices up and interest rates down. Fortunately, European economies that had been sluggish when Asia was booming are now improving. But Europe too is starting to feel the impact of the Asian woes.
The world's economies and financial systems, for better and for worse, are more integrated than ever before and it is unlikely that the American boom and the Asian virus can coexist for long. A wiser Congress now would be devoting itself to two tasks. First, it would be looking for policies to try to keep Asia from turning into a total economic disaster area. Second, it would be trying to husband resources so that our Government will be able to withstand a slowdown if one comes without having to either raise taxes or sink into another huge budget deficit.
Instead, the Congressional leadership seems to be determined to pursue the opposite course. The bill to provide badly needed funds for the International Monetary Fund languishes while the tax breaks, which will be at their most costly in a few years, take center stage. It would appear that the Capitol is in a different world from the one the Treasury is working so hard to keep afloat.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT;
Excerpts From Supreme Court Opinion on H.I.V. Infection as a Disability

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from today's Supreme Court ruling that people infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, are protected from discrimination under the Americans With Disabilities Act even if they suffer no symptoms of AIDS. The opinion, Randon Bragdon v. Sidney Abbott, was written by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. A dissenting opinion was written by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Sandra Day O'Connor.
 
FROM THE DECISION
By Justice Kennedy
Respondent Sidney Abbott has been infected with H.I.V. since 1986. When the incidents we recite occurred, her infection had not manifested its most serious symptoms. On Sept. 16, 1994, she went to the office of petitioner Randon Bragdon in Bangor, Me., for a dental appointment. She disclosed her H.I.V. infection on the patient registration form. 
 Petitioner completed a dental examination, discovered a cavity, and informed respondent of his policy against filling cavities of H.I.V.-infected patients. He offered to perform the work at a hospital with no added fee for his services, though respondent would be responsible for the cost of using the hospital's facilities. Respondent declined. Respondent sued petitioner alleging discrimination on the basis of her disability. . . .
We first review the ruling that respondent's H.I.V. infection constituted a disability under the A.D.A. The statute defines disability as:
"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual;
"(B) a record of such an impairment; or
"(C) being regarded as having such impairment."
We hold respondent's H.I.V. infection was a disability under subsection (A) of the definitional section of the statute. In light of this conclusion, we need not consider the applicability of subsections (B) or (C).
Our consideration of subsection (A) of the definition proceeds in three steps. First, we consider whether respondent's H.I.V. infection was a physical impairment. Second, we identify the life activity upon which respondent relies (reproduction and child bearing) and determine whether it constitutes a major life activity under the A.D.A. Third, tying the two statutory phrases together, we ask whether the impairment substantially limited the major life activity. In construing the statute, we are informed by interpretations of parallel definitions in previous statutes and the views of various administrative agencies which have faced this interpretive question.
The A.D.A.'s definition of disability is drawn almost verbatim from the definition of "handicapped individual" included in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the definition of "handicap" contained in the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988. Congress's repetition of a well-established term carries the implication that Congress intended the term to be construed in accordance with pre-existing regulatory interpretations. In this case, Congress did more than suggest this construction; it adopted a specific statutory provision in the A.D.A. directing as follows:
"Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to apply a lesser standard than the standards applied under title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or the regulations issued by Federal agencies pursuant to such title."
The directive requires us to construe the A.D.A. to grant at least as much protection as provided by the regulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act.
The first step in the inquiry under subsection (A) requires us to determine whether respondent's condition constituted a physical impairment. The Department of Health, Education and Welfare (H.E.W.) issued the first regulations interpreting the Rehabilitation Act in 1977. The regulations are of particular significance because, at the time, H.E.W. was the agency responsible for coordinating the implementation and enforcement of 504. The H.E.W. regulations, which appear without change in the current regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, define "physical or mental impairment" to mean:
"(A) any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems: neurological; musculoskeletal; special sense organs; respiratory, including speech organs; cardiovascular; reproductive, digestive, genito-urinary; hemic and lymphatic; skin; and endocrine; or
"(B) any mental or psychological disorder, such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities."
In issuing these regulations, H.E.W. decided against including a list of disorders constituting physical or mental impairments, out of concern that any specific enumeration might not be comprehensive. The commentary accompanying the regulations, however, contains a representative list of disorders and conditions constituting physical impairments, including "such diseases and conditions as orthopedic, visual, speech, and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental retardation, emotional illness, and drug addiction and alcoholism." . . .
H.I.V. infection is not included in the list of specific disorders constituting physical impairments, in part because H.I.V. was not identified as the cause of AIDS until 1983. . . .
In light of the immediacy with which the virus begins to damage the infected person's white blood cells and the severity of the disease, we hold it is an impairment from the moment of infection. As noted earlier, infection with H.I.V. causes immediate abnormalities in a person's blood, and the infected person's white cell count continues to drop throughout the course of the disease, even when the attack is concentrated in the lymph nodes. In light of these facts, H.I.V. infection must be regarded as a physiological disorder with a constant and detrimental effect on the infected person's hemic and lymphatic systems from the moment of infection. H.I.V. infection satisfies the statutory and regulatory definition of a physical impairment during every stage of the disease.
The statute is not operative, and the definition not satisfied, unless the impairment affects a major life activity. Respondent's claim throughout this case has been that the H.I.V. infection placed a substantial limitation on her ability to reproduce and to bear children. Given the pervasive, and invariably fatal, course of the disease, its effect on major life activities of many sorts might have been relevant to our inquiry. Respondent and a number of amici make arguments about H.I.V.'s profound impact on almost every phase of the infected person's life. In light of these submissions, it may seem legalistic to circumscribe our discussion to the activity of reproduction. We have little doubt that had different parties brought the suit they would have maintained that an H.I.V. infection imposes substantial limitations on other major life activities.
From the outset, however, the case has been treated as one in which reproduction was the major life activity limited by the impairment. It is our practice to decide cases on the grounds raised and considered in the Court of Appeals and included in the question on which we granted certiorari. We ask, then, whether reproduction is a major life activity.
We have little difficulty concluding that it is. . . .
Conception and childbirth are not impossible for an H.I.V. victim but, without doubt, are dangerous to the public health. This meets the definition of a substantial limitation. The decision to reproduce carries economic and legal consequences as well. There are added costs for antiretroviral therapy, supplemental insurance, and long-term health care for the child who must be examined and, tragic to think, treated for the infection. The laws of some states, moreover, forbid persons infected with H.I.V. from having sex with others, regardless of consent. . . .
In the end, the disability definition does not turn on personal choice. When significant limitations result from the impairment, the definition is met even if the difficulties are not insurmountable. For the statistical and other reasons we have cited, of course, the limitations on reproduction may be insurmountable here. Testimony from the respondent that her H.I.V. infection controlled her decision not to have a child is unchallenged. . . . Respondent's H.I.V. infection is a physical impairment which substantially limits a major life activity, as the A.D.A. defines it. In view of our holding, we need not address the second question presented, i.e., whether H.I.V. infection is a per se disability under the A.D.A. . . .
One comprehensive and significant administrative precedent is a 1988 opinion issued by the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice (O.L.C.) concluding that the Rehabilitation Act "protects symptomatic and asymptomatic H.I.V.-infected individuals against discrimination in any covered program." . . . O.L.C. determined further that asymptomatic H.I.V. imposed a substantial limit on the major life activity of reproduction. The opinion said:
"Based on the medical knowledge available to us, we believe that it is reasonable to conclude that the life activity of procreation is substantially limited for an asymptomatic H.I.V.-infected individual. In light of the significant risk that the AIDS virus may be transmitted to a baby during pregnancy, H.I.V.-infected individuals cannot, whether they are male or female, engage in the act of procreation with the normal expectation of bringing forth a healthy child." . . .
We conclude the proper course is to give the Court of Appeals the opportunity to determine whether our analysis of some of the studies cited by the parties would change its conclusion that petitioner presented neither objective evidence nor a triable issue of fact on the question of risk. In remanding the case, we do not foreclose the possibility that the Court of Appeals may reach the same conclusion it did earlier. A remand will permit a full exploration of the issue through the adversary process.
The determination of the Court of Appeals that respondent's H.I.V. infection was a disability under the A.D.A. is affirmed. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
 
FROM THE DISSENT
By Chief Justice Rehnquist
The A.D.A.'s definition of a "disability" requires that the major life activity at issue be one "of such individual." The Court truncates the question, perhaps because there is not a shred of record evidence indicating that, prior to becoming infected with H.I.V., respondent's major life activities included reproduction (assuming for the moment that reproduction is a major life activity at all). At most, the record indicates that after learning of her H.I.V. status, respondent, whatever her previous inclination, conclusively decided that she would not have children. There is absolutely no evidence that, absent the H.I.V., respondent would have had or was even considering having children. Indeed, when asked during her deposition whether her H.I.V. infection had in any way impaired her ability to carry out any of her life functions, respondent answered "No." It is further telling that in the course of her entire brief to this Court, respondent studiously avoids asserting even once that reproduction is a major life activity to her. To the contrary, she argues that the "major life activity" inquiry should not turn on a particularized assessment of the circumstances of this or any other case.
But even aside from the facts of this particular case, the Court is simply wrong in concluding as a general matter that reproduction is a "major life activity." Unfortunately, the A.D.A. does not define the phrase "major life activities." But the Act does incorporate by reference a list of such activities contained in regulations issued under the Rehabilitation Act. The Court correctly recognizes that this list of major life activities "is illustrative, not exhaustive," but then makes no attempt to demonstrate that reproduction is a major life activity in the same sense that "caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working" are.
Instead, the Court argues that reproduction is a "major" life activity in that it is "central to the life process itself." . . . In support of this reading, the Court focuses on the fact that "major" "indicates comparative importance," . . . ignoring the alternative definition of "major" as "greater in quantity, number, or extent." It is the latter definition that is most consistent with the A.D.A.'s illustrative list of major life activities.
No one can deny that reproductive decisions are important in a person's life. But so are decisions as to who to marry, where to live, and how to earn one's living. Fundamental importance of this sort is not the common thread linking the statute's listed activities. The common thread is rather that the activities are repetitively performed and essential in the day-to-day existence of a normally functioning individual. They are thus quite different from the series of activities leading to the birth of a child.
Both respondent and the United States as amicus curiae, argue that reproduction must be a major life activity because regulations issued under the A.D.A. define the term "physical impairment" to include physiological disorders affecting the reproductive system. If reproduction were not a major life activity, they argue, then it would have made little sense to include the reproductive disorders in the roster of physical impairments. This argument is simply wrong. There are numerous disorders of the reproductive system, such as dysmenorrhea and endometriosis, which are so painful that they limit a woman's ability to engage in major life activities such as walking and working. And, obviously, cancer of the various reproductive organs limits one's ability to engage in numerous activities other than reproduction.
But even if I were to assume that reproduction is a major life activity of respondent, I do not agree that an asymptomatic H.I.V. infection "substantially limits" that activity. The record before us leaves no doubt that those so infected are still entirely able to engage in sexual intercourse, give birth to a child if they become pregnant, and perform the manual tasks necessary to rear a child to maturity. While individuals infected with H.I.V. may choose not to engage in these activities, there is no support in language, logic, or our case law for the proposition that such voluntary choices constitute a "limit" on one's own life activities.
The Court responds that the A.D.A. "addresses substantial limitations on major life activities, not utter inabilities." I agree, but fail to see how this assists the Court's cause. Apart from being unable to demonstrate that she is utterly unable to engage in the various activities that comprise the reproductive process, respondent has not even explained how she is less able to engage in those activities.
Respondent contends that her ability to reproduce is limited because "the fatal nature of H.I.V. infection means that a parent is unlikely to live long enough to raise and nurture the child to adulthood." But the A.D.A.'s definition of a disability is met only if the alleged impairment substantially "limits" (present tense) a major life activity. Asymptomatic H.I.V. does not presently limit respondent's ability to perform any of the tasks necessary to bear or raise a child. Respondent's argument, taken to its logical extreme, would render every individual with a genetic marker for some debilitating disease "disabled" here and now because of some possible future effects.
In my view, therefore, respondent has failed to demonstrate that any of her major life activities were substantially limited by her H.I.V. infection.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Clarifies G.O.P. Stands on Trade

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
As President Clinton arrived in China, Representative Newt Gingrich suddenly stepped forward today to polish Republican credentials on an array of international issues, from trade relations with China to long-stalled financing for the International Monetary Fund.
The House Speaker, a Georgia Republican, promised that Congress would try again this September to give President Clinton expanded fast-track trade-negotiating authority -- an issue that sharply divides Democrats. 
 "The only country economically strong enough to keep the world economy moving forward is the United States," Mr. Gingrich said. "The trick is for us to send a signal that we want a stronger and more vibrant world market, and that means a strong vote on fast track."
Mr. Gingrich made his announcement standing with a bipartisan group of lawmakers from farm states who have come under increasing pressure from agricultural and business groups on issues affecting global trade, particularly the economic crisis in Asia.
Some corporate leaders complain that Republicans are threatening American competitiveness by opposing satellite deals with China and supporting sanctions against countries charged with religious persecution. The House has also been holding up an $18 billion contribution to the I.M.F., which the Administration says is needed to maintain economic stability in Asia and Russia.
In a sign of discontent, Charles S. Mack and Bernadette A. Budde of the Business-Industry PAC, which makes recommendations to corporate political-action committees, wrote to members in March, "How ironic that, after decades of G.O.P. rhetoric pledging fealty to free enterprise, global competition, and less government interference, business cannot rely on a Republican Congress to advance these principles."
Mr. Gingrich's stance today won instant praise from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and allowed farm state lawmakers to go home for the Independence Day recess beginning today with promises of action to lift farm exports. But the Speaker's move seemed aimed at seeking partisan advantage at least as much as resolving the disputes festering in Congress.
Fast-track legislation would grant the President the right to negotiate trade agreements that Congress can approve or reject, but not amend. In a severe setback for Mr. Clinton, such legislation was pulled from the House floor last November because it failed to garner enough votes for passage. The opposition was led by Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Minority Leader, who carried the majority of House Democrats with him.
Granting such Presidential powers over trading agreements is considered even more difficult to pass in an election year, and the White House already indicated that it would not seek another vote on the issue before the mid-term elections. By scheduling a vote in September, the Republicans would split the Democrats at the moment when they most need Mr. Clinton to be campaigning for them.
Both the White House and Mr. Gephardt today called the financing of the I.M.F. more pressing than the fast-track issue.
"We think from an economic point of view, the financial crisis in Asia has a much more direct impact on the economic well-being of Americans and that issue needs to be dealt with first," said Joe Lockhart, a spokesman for Mr. Clinton. As for the fast track, Mr. Gephardt called a new debate "simply irrelevant at this juncture."
Mr. Gingrich said he thought fast-track legislation could gain more votes this year because of the Asian crisis and decline in farm prices. "My instinct is that a lot of members who were wavering last fall now realize that it's very important for us to pass this," he said.
On the I.M.F., Mr. Gingrich said he was looking for a bipartisan agreement, with strings attached. "We think that it's very, very important that we have legitimate oversight and legitimate checks on exactly what the I.M.F. is doing, where it's been successful, and where it's frankly just caused more problems than it's helped," he said.
The Senate voted 84 to 16 in March to provide the I.M.F. with the full $18 billion sought by the Clinton Administration, provided certain conditions were met by the lender. But the House demanded far greater changes in the way the agency operates. And last year it tied I.M.F. financing to an abortion dispute.
Mr. Gingrich did not indicate today what level of funding he would support or what conditions the House would impose on the agency. But he acknowledged that the problems in Asia and Russia have heightened the need for Congress to act.
"With the kind of changes you have in Indonesia, in Russia and in South Korea, and the potential challenges in Japan, we have an obligation to work with the International Monetary Fund," he said.
In a sign of the difficulties Mr. Gingrich could face from other Republicans, however, Representative Tom DeLay, the House Majority Whip, immediately denounced the fund. "Giving the I.M.F. more money is not a panacea for all the troubles that bedevil the Asian economy," he said. "In fact, in many instances, the I.M.F is the problem, not the solution."
On another issue that Mr. Gingrich termed of "critical importance," the House Ways and Means Committee today came out strongly in favor of giving China the normal trade status accorded most other nations.
The President has called for an annual renewal of such ties, over objections from critics who cite China's human rights abuses, its occupation of Tibet, and allegations that China tried to influence elections in the United States through campaign donations. To stop Mr. Clinton from giving the renewal, Congress would have to pass a resolution of disapproval.

HEADLINE: U.S. Allows An Exception In Supporting Loan for India

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
Yesterday, only six weeks after India conducted nuclear tests, prompting economic sanctions by the United States, the World Bank resumed its lending program to New Delhi with the endorsement of the Clinton Administration.
Washington said the aid, $543 million in loans, is chiefly humanitarian and thus exempt from its sanctions. 
 The Administration's decision suggested that despite Mr. Clinton's warnings about the harm that economic sanctions would do to India and to Pakistan, which later conducted tests of its own, most World Bank projects will probably move ahead. The bank focuses most programs on health, nutrition, education and rural development; it is unclear whether the Administration will seek to block electric power projects, which are often part of development programs.
The new loan is for Andhra Pradesh, a state that has been a leader in economic reform. The state has 73 million people, and the bank said about 30 percent of the children suffer from malnutrition. The literacy rate is 44 percent, lower than India's average.
The package the bank approved is directed at those problems, including projects to insure that more children complete primary school, to train health workers and to pay for immunization and nutrition services for preschool children and pregnant and nursing women. Money for irrigation systems and the maintenance of rural roads is also included.
The Treasury Department, which enforces Washington's sanctions, said all the programs fall under an exception in the 1994 Nuclear Nonproliferation Act. That law requires Washington to cut off virtually all direct aid to nations that conduct nuclear tests; it also bans American banks from making loans to their governments and mandates that the United States vote against aid to those countries by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
But the law exempts aid for "basic human needs," a category that is not defined in the legislation. It is up to the Administration to devise a definition, and it appears to have chosen a relatively broad one, especially after it became clear that other industrialized countries would not join in voting against most World Bank programs for the poor. The United States has about 18 percent of the voting power in the bank, not enough to block a program by itself.
Yesterday's decision signals that the economic pain from the sanctions will be less than India and Pakistan first feared. India is the largest borrower from the bank, receiving $1.5 billion this year, not counting yesterday's program. Pakistan receives less from the bank, but the aid is a larger portion of its economy.
It is unclear what will happen to aid for India's national power projects. A loan of $450 million, part of a $5.7 billion program for a power-distribution network, was put on hold a month ago.
Perhaps the most severe sanction against both countries, however, is being meted out by the currency markets.
The combination of the nuclear tests and an unpopular budget have scared investors away from India, sending its currency plunging. That has forced leaders of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party to draw up new economic reforms, to end state monopolies in insurance and to make it easier for foreigners to buy real estate, in the hope of drawing in foreign investment.

In This Merged, Merged World, Anything Goes

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON 

 BODY:
Another day, another dozen deals.
On a single day last month, Office Depot, an eye on expanding abroad, agreed to buy Viking Office Products in a $3 billion stock swap; Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company announced a $1.59 billion hostile tender offer for Allied Group, an Iowa car and home insurer; Dillard's, the Midwestern retailer, bought the Mercantile Stores Company for $2.9 billion, and Cardinal Health, hoping to become a one-stop service provider for pharmaceutical companies, paid $2.2 billion in stock for R. P. Scherer.
And those were just the biggest fish. In all, 11 proposed deals with a total value of about $17 billion were announced on May 18. It was a pace almost unheard of -- or would have been last year or the year before. In 1998, though, it wasn't so unusual. The growing conviction by corporations worldwide that bigger is better in the global marketplace has generated a merger wave that has dwarfed anything that preceded it. 
 In the United States, the value of mergers and acquisitions announced through June 25 soared by 153 percent from the same point a year earlier, to $910 billion, according to the Securities Data Corporation. Indeed, that number is already just under the total for all of last year.
Worldwide, deals doubled to $1.3 trillion, fast approaching the $1.6 trillion record for all of last year. Acquisitions of bargain-priced Asian concerns by United States companies are running at a frenetic pace, and activity in Europe is approaching record levels.
"We're all surprised when we open the newspaper Monday morning," said Mac Heller, global head of mergers and acquisitions at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The push into foreign markets and the sense these days that no company is untouchable, and practically no deal is impossible, are driving many of this year's mergers. Daimler-Benz's $39 billion merger agreement with the Chrysler Corporation last month, for example, will create a colossus employing 420,000 workers, giving the German car maker easier access to American buyers and providing Chrysler a formidable new base in Europe.
Even the general public is taking notice. Cyberinvestors swapped rumors on Internet chat boards weeks before Tyco International and the U.S. Surgical Corporation announced their merger on May 25. An E-mail message making the rounds this spring joked that Bert and Ernie from "Sesame Street" were combining to become Bernie. Television has gotten into the act, with two lawyers in a recent episode of "The Practice," a popular evening drama, casually throwing around terms like M& A as they reminisced about their dreams in law school.
The merger boom is driven in part by the exuberant American economy. Lower interest rates, of course, have made stocks an attractive place to invest. But most companies are using their own shares to make acquisitions, for several reasons, said Rick Escherich, a managing director in the mergers and acquisitions group at J. P. Morgan.
For one thing, the accounting treatment on many stock deals is tax-free. Companies that pay cash don't get such a break. Moreover, low inflation and the sheer size of the deals being done today -- eight mergers in the last three months alone have exceeded $25 billion each, and three have surpassed $60 billion -- usually leave debt financing out of the question. Besides, institutional investors are more willing to take stock as a way to stay fully invested in a given industry.
Most important, there is a growing consensus among corporate executives that in a global economy, the only choice is between being one of the top two or three players in an industry or slowly bleeding to death. Recently, several high-profile unions -- including those of Citicorp with the Travelers Group, the Nationsbank Corporation with BankAmerica and Chrysler with Daimler-Benz -- have spurred a new sense of urgency and a sense that almost anything is possible. Byron Wein, head United States strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, says companies are more pressed to grab friendly partners now or become targets themselves.
"There used to be a feeling out there that there were certain trophy properties and that they'd never trade," Mr. Wein said. "Now the feeling is if Citicorp and Daimler can trade, anything can. If something unique doesn't go to you, your second alternative may not be all that desirable."
What a stretch from the 1980's, when many companies were acquired in hostile takeover wars, disassembled and then sold in parts to the highest bidder. Now it is a virtual love fest, with companies strategically piecing themselves back together to create advantages they say can only be achieved by merging.
"Most people understand it's a game of scale and size," said Jack Grubman, a telecommunications analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "Having a handful of players at the end of the day will be more competitive then having thousands of fragmented companies."
The grab for assets will continue as long as current market sentiment prevails. And even if the stock market crashes, many on Wall Street believe, demand for acquisitions will remain strong as financial buyers looking for bargains enter the fray.
In the United States, financial services deals -- including those involving banks and insurance companies -- have led the way, totaling $347 billion, or 38 percent of all activity, so far this year. One reason is that the target companies have such high market values. "It used to be that a $3 billion to $5 billion deal was a significant transaction," said Ralph Watts, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Salomon Smith Barney. "That has been eclipsed by the mega-deal."
On April 13, for instance, two mergers -- between Nationsbank and BankAmerica, and between First Chicago and Banc One -- were announced and added up to $90 billion in value. Compare that with last year, when all merger and acquisition activity in the bank and insurance industry in the first six months tallied about the same amount.
In fact, the sheer number of worldwide deals -- 10,401 so far, according to Securities Data -- has given every firm on Wall Street a reason to boast. Morgan Stanley was the adviser for the greatest number, 182 to date, and aided Britain's Energy Group in its merger with the Texas Utilities Company. Salomon Smith Barney, which is owned by the Travelers Group, helped engineer the largest merger this year, the marriage of Travelers and Citicorp. Merrill Lynch often finds itself across the table from Goldman, Sachs in bank negotiations. And Credit Suisse First Boston had the ear of AT&T when it announced the acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. on Wednesday.
But the real bragging rights belong to Goldman, Sachs, which not only had a hand in eight of the 10 largest deals this year but also advised on 160 transactions valued at $549 billion, the largest dollar volume by far of any investment bank.
The partnership's client list is a register of the world's corporate elite. These include Monsanto, Ameritech, Daimler-Benz. But this year's showing is due, in particular, to Goldman's high-powered financial-institutions team, which represented, among others, BankAmerica, First Chicago and Wells Fargo.
Even so, Mr. Heller of Goldman says he is puzzled by all the attention given mergers these days. On a recent trip to his hometown of Dayton, Ohio, he was cornered in a grocery store by an old school chum who quizzed him on the hottest merger prospects. "It kind of made me sad," he recalled wistfully. "The main event for the economy is how good a job companies are doing in delivering products and services. Not the merger business. Not Wall Street. Not Goldman, Sachs."
He has a point. Despite this buoyant market, chief executives still have some basic issues to address to insure success, said Mark Maybell, an investment banker at Merrill Lynch. For one thing, they have to deliver on promises made in announcing the deal or their stock will take a hit later. Every combination has to pass regulatory review. And management has to integrate the corporate cultures successfully or both customers and staff will bolt.
Although it is not an entirely new phenomenon, more chief executives are merging their offices as well as their companies by naming themselves co-chief executives. The arrangement keeps both leaders in the spotlight and gainfully employed, although few such marriages of convenience last between people who are not accustomed to sharing power.
In recent hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Joel I. Klein, head of the antitrust division of the Department of Justice, said his agency would not restrict mergers based on size, but would continue to scrutinize combinations for their effects on competition and pricing. He warned, however, that he would look with disfavor on any companies that plead the need to expand in a global economy as an excuse to create entities that stifle competition at home. "The mere invocation of increased globalization as a purported rationale for a merger does not result in a free pass from competitive review," Mr. Klein said.
The big question -- one that won't be answered for several years -- is whether the 1990's will be remembered as a successful retooling of larger, more competitive corporations or just another era of Wall Street hype.
"If we have a stable economy, people are going to say we did smart things," said Gary Parr, head of mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley. But if the economy turns sharply down, he added, "they are going to say these people got carried away."

HEADLINE: Yankees and Mets Play Ball For Hearts (and Handouts)

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
If the heavens cooperate tonight, two teams will gather on a swath of Queens County grass to demonstrate how the game of baseball has particularly blessed New York City this year with talent and character. An umpire will shout a familiar demand, the Mets' Al Leiter will fire a baseball to the Yankees' Chuck Knoblauch, and all will be right in one corner of an ever-churning metropolis.
As they say from Queens Boulevard to the Bronx River Parkway: Yeah, right. If you want "Field of Dreams" fantasies, it would be best to go chase flies in some sandlot. 
 The current issues and historic emotions woven through this weekend's three-game series at Shea Stadium go far beyond the typical smell-the-cut-grass baseball blather. There are fortunes at stake here, as well as a borough's identity. There are the dueling political futures of a Mayor and a City Council Speaker at risk. There are two owners who chuckle through gritted teeth and say that no rivalry exists. And there are the fans who want nothing more than the right to brag.
"There are certain teams where the players really hate each other," said David Halberstam, the author, who has written extensively about sports. "But this is a rivalry built up by the fans. It's about who rules New York. Who rules the city?"
It is true: Yankees and Mets fans don't much like each other. Baseball genealogists trace the roots of this mutual enmity to turn-of-the-century city teams called the Highlanders, who became the Yankees; the Giants; and the Superbas, who became the Dodgers.
Even Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose fashion sense permits him on occasion to wear a Yankee warm-up jacket and cap, does not even bother pretending that he likes both teams equally. "One, it would be dishonest," he said. "Two, I wouldn't get away with it."
But at the same time that the Mets and the Yankees are encouraging the rivalry by playing some of the best baseball in the major leagues, they are also seeking public subsidies in the hundreds of millions of dollars to finance new ball parks. This has residents of their host city pondering answers to a couple of questions: At what price baseball? And can New York, given the shifts in everything from the economics of the sport to the demographics of the city, continue to support two teams?
Both teams see new stadiums as essential to their survival. The Mets want an old-style park to be built alongside Shea that would bring back eye-watering memories of Brooklyn's Ebbets Field but sport the futuristic touches of a retractable dome and a removable-grass playing field. The Yankees want to abandon the Bronx landmark of Yankee Stadium for a ball park on the West Side of Manhattan.
Imagine the majestic skyline looming behind center field, Yankee types say, their eyes as wide as silver dollars. And if you can't, imagine the Yankees in New Jersey.
Perhaps because threats are rhetorically unwise, the public debate over the two proposals has been closer to a hollering match between competing beer vendors. It has not, for sure, been a dispassionate evaluation on merit. The Mayor, the City Council, the city's teachers, self-styled defenders of good government and a medley of political candidates and gadflies have all waxed apoplectic on the subject. It's enough to make the musings of former Governor Mario M. Cuomo -- who also made a cameo appearance in the debate -- seem touchingly quaint.
"I love to see guys who chew and never smile," said Mr. Cuomo, himself a former minor-league ballplayer. "And when they take off their hat they're bald -- and they don't care. I love the game."
Through it all, the Mets and the Yankees have provided more than enough moments, from the bravura to the bizarre, to help explain the sell-out crowds for this year's series. The Yankees won last year's series at Yankee Stadium, two games to one, when baseball instituted interleague play.
The two teams also offer some hope that baseball just might be able to transcend city politics. Take Orlando Hernandez, who fled Cuba on a sailboat the day after Christmas, spent a few days on a deserted island before being rescued, and is now pitching for the Yankees with a poise that suggests he took MetroNorth in from Scarsdale. Or Rick Reed, the Mets pitcher who was once ostracized for crossing the picket line during a strike in 1995, but whose pitching excellence has won over his colleagues. Or that day in May when the Mets pulled off an old-fashioned blockbuster trade, acquiring Mike Piazza, the All-Star catcher.
And, of course, there is David Wells, the Yankees pitcher with the longshoreman's physique who once nearly came to blows with the team's owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d. Last month he pitched a perfect game, winning one for big lugs everywhere.
But the whiff of politics, not pretzels, envelops New York baseball this year, and Mr. Wells's rare feat could not enter posterity unmarked. Mayor Giuliani immediately arranged to present him with the key to the city. The one person specifically not invited to the City Hall event was Peter F. Vallone, Speaker of the City Council, candidate for Governor and stubborn proponent of the notion that the city's voters ought to decide the fate of Yankee Stadium. Thus the snub had nothing to do with the Speaker's Queens roots, and everything to do with stadiums.
The Giuliani administration feels that it cannot risk calling Mr. Steinbrenner's bluff when he says that Yankee Stadium is too old and inconvenient for the team to remain financially competitive with the likes of the Baltimore Orioles and the Cleveland Indians, both of which have attracted huge crowds with new stadiums. A 500-pound rocker joint that fell from the stadium's rafters earlier this year provided punctuation to that point of view.
Mr. Steinbrenner has once again invoked his often-broken vow of silence on the matter. Howard J. Rubenstein, his spokesman, said Mr. Steinbrenner would announce in the fall "where he wants the stadium to be: that's the West Side, the Bronx, or New Jersey."
Sophisticated enough to recognize Mr. Steinbrenner's broad hints that the Bronx will no longer do, the Mayor raised the possibility -- the conclusion, his critics say -- of dropping a stadium onto a railbed along a moribund stretch of Manhattan's West Side. He also proposed using the revenues of a business tax to pay for the city's share of new stadiums for both the Yankees and the Mets, and talked about the economic boost that would follow. And he shrugged off allegations of being a Steinbrenner sycophant.
"I would react the same way to the Mets and the stock exchange," Mr. Giuliani said this week. "It's purely business. I don't conceive it as my job as the Mayor to lose valuable New York institutions."
Even so, baseball in New York was no longer just about hitting and pitching.
Mr. Vallone, a Democrat, quickly framed the debate in populist terms: the rich owner benefiting at the expense of the taxpayer; the struggling Bronx losing out to glittering Manhattan; the arrogant Mayor ignoring the will of the people.
Mr. Vallone proposed a referendum on a Manhattan stadium, Mr. Giuliani vowed to block it -- and suddenly the cordial deliberations between the Mayor and the Council over the city's surplus budget became a sort of screaming match between dysfunctional family members over a Thanksgiving meal. Baseball, in a sense, helped lead the Council to adopt its own budget, in defiance of a strong-willed Mayor, and to approve the Speaker's referendum plan this week. And baseball, in a sense, now could lead to cuts in city financing for nonprofit agencies, as a result of the crossfire.
A recent radio commercial, paid for by the Council's political committee, used the familiar sound of a bat hitting a ball to support the message that Little League -- not the Yankees -- had become "part of the budget battle: the Giuliani administration versus your City Council, and your children." And the other night, the Council held a public forum called "Take Me Out to the New Ball Park," at which the 30-odd audience members applauded any criticism of Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Steinbrenner.
"Schools are falling apart! Plaster is falling on students, but that doesn't seem to bother Mayor Giuliani," a teacher from the Upper West Side cried. "We need to build new schools."
All because of baseball.
Mr. Cuomo, who generally supports the West Side proposal, said that earlier this year he urged the Yankees to tread carefully into the turbulent world of public opinion. He said he suggested that the team take several months to do research on the West Side proposal and then develop a clear-cut plan to give to the city -- after the fall's gubernatorial election. "What you need is consensus," he said. "If you don't have it, the politicians won't agree with it. And politicians do nothing that the polls say you don't want done."
The former Governor's voice trailed off in disgust. "I'm so aggravated by what's happening here," he said. "This is the classic prescribed device for arriving at the wrong conclusions: Start by ignoring the facts."
While Mr. Steinbrenner finds himself trying to play down this year's spike in attendance at Yankee Stadium, the Mets organization quietly awaits city approval for a plan that, when compared to the Yankees' desires, comes off as just another capital project.
The Mets drew three million people when they won the World Series in 1986, a number they matched by making the playoffs in 1988; since then, mediocrity has led to a plummet in attendance, to 1.7 million last year. So far this year, the numbers have improved slightly. But Fred Wilpon, the team's co-owner, said that the benefits of a new stadium "are not only in attendance, but in all other kinds of revenue. Everyone has great seats, they go more to the concessions stands, attend more games. People want to be there."
Tonight, at least, Shea Stadium will be sold out. But Mr. Steinbrenner will not be in attendance for any of the three games. Prior commitments, he said, require his presence in Tampa, Fla.

HEADLINE: U.A.W. Strike Is Being Felt Far From Flint

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich., June 25

 BODY:
Strikes at two General Motors' parts factories here, which started as local disputes over work hours and equipment investments, are producing economic effects now slowly rippling out across North America.
The strike was felt immediately in this town because the General Motors Corporation accounts for more than half the employment and taxes. When 3,400 workers went on strike at a metal parts stamping factory here on June 5, nearby restaurants lost half their business, while the pool table and bar stools at the pub across the street have been deserted. 
 G.M. soon closed 26 of its 29 assembly plants in North America and curtailed production at nearly 100 parts factories. These factories have temporarily laid off 147,900 production workers, including 10,400 in Canada and 32,400 in Mexico, nearly half of G.M.'s North American work force. The Labor Department announced today that first-time claims for unemployment jumped 10.3 percent last week in the United States, the first of many economic indicators likely to reflect the strike's effects.
Now the impact of the strike is reaching into communities and states where the auto industry has been less visible than in the industrial Midwest. ITT Industries has laid off 1,200 workers at a windshield wiper factory in Rochester. The Lear Corporation has laid off 2,800 employees at car seat factories from Delaware to Texas. And Harvard Industries has laid off 900 of the 1,250 workers at its factories in Churchill, Tenn.; Wytheville, Va., and Newfields, N.H.
The latest strike has surpassed in lost production a strike two years ago at two G.M. brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, and amounts to the costliest labor dispute in the auto industry since a two-month national strike against G.M. in 1970. Private economists are beginning to shave their estimates of the annualized growth rate of the nation's economic output during the second quarter. Prior to the strike, the consensus was for the economy to expand at about a 3 percent annual rate; now experts expect that to be more like 2.5 percent because of the strike.
The economy rebounded sharply after previous G.M. strikes, as auto workers put in overtime to make up for lost production, and the same is expected this time, Government and private economists said. Economic indicators "do bounce back the following quarter" after G.M. strikes, said Lee Price, the Commerce Department's chief economist.
But the strikes are already beginning to cause hardship for some, although many companies are trying to soften the blow in order to hold on to skilled workers at a time of low unemployment.
Autoliv ASP Inc. furloughed nearly 450 employees at air bag factories around Salt Lake City this week. Many of Autoliv's workers reluctantly volunteered for their furloughs as an unpaid summer vacation. One of them, Nikki Vaughn, a 20-year-old assembly line worker who is expecting a baby in September, volunteered for the furlough rather than accept a job on another, unfamiliar Autoliv assembly line making parts for another auto maker. "We didn't think it would affect us, but now it has," Ms. Vaughn said, adding that she would save money by shortening a planned vacation this summer.
The Capitol Coney Island Family Restaurant, a 24-hour establishment near one of the Flint factories, has allowed workers to leave early but has not laid off anyone even though business is off by a quarter in the restaurant and three-quarters at the takeout window. "It's hard to find people," said Philip Kosman, the restaurant's owner.
Gerry G. Tighe, the general counsel of Harvard Industries, said that he wished the White House would take a bigger role in seeking to end the strike. President Clinton has expressed concern about the strike, but has said that the company and the union should settle their disagreements through collective bargaining.
 The 9,200 striking workers here are collecting $150 a week in benefits from the United Automobile Workers union. Laid-off workers are generally eligible for state unemployment benefits of $200 or $300 a week, depending on the state. G.M. said on Wednesday that it would try to block benefits for laid-off U.A.W. workers but an attempt in 1996 by G.M. to do so met with little success.
With growing signs that the strike will not be settled during G.M.'s annual summer shutdown during the first two weeks of July -- and with the likelihood that it will take two or three weeks for new parts to be made and for factories to reopen after a settlement -- economists are also reconsidering their growth forecasts for the third quarter. Paul Ballew, the Federal Reserve's expert on the auto industry for many years and now the chief economist at J. D. Power & Associates, the consulting firm, said that the strike could reduce economic growth in the third quarter by as much as seven-tenths of a percentage point if the strike lasts into August, as leaders of the United Automobile Workers union threatened this week. The lost production might not be recouped until the end of the first quarter of next year, because it is difficult to make up for lost production during the autumn, when new models are being introduced, he added.
William A. Strauss, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that while the strike's effects might be temporary, it could have a slight but longer-lasting effect, increasing inflation. The auto industry has been in a price war, spurred by a glut of late-model used cars and the dollar's rise in value in currency markets, which makes imported cars and car parts cheaper. New-vehicle prices have dropped by nine-tenths of 1 percent in the last 12 months. This has helped to restrain inflation because new car prices make up 5.1 percent of the Consumer Price Index.
G.M. is likely to offer fewer discounts as it runs low on cars. And, because G.M. still holds nearly a third of the United States auto market, other auto makers may follow its example, Mr. Strauss said.
"It's a likely scenario that we're going to have less competition, which means higher prices," he said.
G.M. laid off 1,500 more employees today, mostly auto parts workers in the United States and Mexico. G.M. executives asked assembly plant managers on Wednesday morning to send home any "nonessential" maintenance workers at shuttered factories and turn off the power to the machinery to save money on utility bills. But G.M. officials said today that this would result in very few layoffs.
According to the Commerce Department, the Dayton strike trimmed three-tenths of a percentage point from the annualized rate of economic growth in the first quarter of 1996. Growth in that quarter was 1.8 percent, but the economy recovered with 6 percent growth during the second quarter of that year.
The 1970 strike had a greater effect. The annualized change in economic activity actually dropped 3.9 percent in the fourth quarter, when the strike occurred, but then bounced back with an 11.3 percent gain in the first quarter of 1971.
The current strikes could have a longer-term economic effect if they result in G.M.'s closing some of its chronically unprofitable small-car factories in the United States and investing overseas instead. Donald Hackworth, G.M.'s group vice president for North American cars, said last week that G.M. would reconsider its investment plans in the United States if the U.A.W. did not agree to improve productivity.
G.M. is the nation's largest company and its North American operations account for about 1.5 percent of the nation's economic output. In 1970, G.M. still accounted for 2.3 percent, according to the Commerce Department.
G.M.'s after-tax losses from the current strikes are approaching $1 billion, for which the company is not insured. Through Friday, G.M. will have lost the production of roughly 230,000 vehicles, compared with 180,000 vehicles lost during the Dayton strikes.
The effects of the current G.M. strikes would be even worse were it not for the nation's strong economy, which is making it easier for laid-off workers to find new jobs. Trucking companies are having a very hard time finding drivers, for example, and have been taking out newspaper advertisements and sending recruiters here.
"Some of the drivers in this area don't have as much to do because of the strike," said Bill Davis, a recruiter for Certified Transport L.L.C., who drove five hours here from Indianapolis on Wednesday morning to hire two drivers who responded to the trucking company's ads.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA;
In Xian, 'A New Chapter in China's Story'

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Clinton's arrival remarks yesterday in China, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a transcription company:
Thank you for the key to your city and for this magnificent welcome. Here in this ancient capital, China seems very young to me tonight, blessed with both a proud history and the promise of tomorrow. I am delighted to begin my journey in Xian, once the capital of China, still the heartland of the Chinese people. 
 I was raised in the heartland of my country. I know that the character of a nation is determined by the hard-working people who live here.
Over 1,000 years ago, during the Tang dynasty, which I have seen recreated tonight, Xian was, perhaps, the most open and culturally advanced city in the entire world. From this place trade routes extended through Asia to Europe and Africa and to this place great thinkers came, spreading philosophy and new ideas that have contributed to the greatness of China.
Tomorrow I look forward to seeing the terra-cotta warriors, the old city walls, the Muslim quarter. I look forward to learning more about China's great contributions to the store of human knowledge, from medicine and printing to mathematics and astronomy, discoveries on which so much of the whole world's progress is based. But I want to see more of the new nation you are building on a scale even the emperors could not have foreseen. The China that gave us printing now boasts fax machines, computers and cell phones. Xian is home to film makers, Internet explorers, business people of every description.
Here in this city famous for calligraphy, a new chapter in China's story is being written. We Americans admire your accomplishments, your economy, your hard work, creativity and vision, your efforts against hunger and poverty, your work with us on peace and stability in Korea and South Asia. A new day is dawning for the Chinese people, for China's greatness lies, as always, with its people.
Our own history has convinced Americans that the greatness of any country is measured in its people, in their shared reverence for family and community, for work and learning and in their individual thoughts, beliefs and creativity. Respect for the worth, the dignity, the potential and the freedom of every citizen is a vital source of America's strength and success.
In this global information age, where both economic growth and individual opportunity are based on ideas, a commitment to providing all human beings the opportunity to develop their full potential is vital to the strength and success of the new China, as well.
As I travel across China I hope to learn as much as I can about the Chinese people, your history and your dreams for the future. And I hope to help the Chinese people understand more of America's history, the lessons the American people have drawn from it and the dreams we hold for the 21st century.
I believe both Chinese and Americans aspire to many of the same things, to provide for our families, to teach our children, to build our communities, to protect our Earth, to shape our own futures and pass brighter possibilities on to our children. There may be those, here and back in America, who wonder whether closer ties and deeper friendship between America and China are good. Clearly, the answer is yes.
We have a powerful ability to help each other grow. We can learn much from each other. And as two great nations we have a special responsibility to the future of the world. The steps we take over the next week can lead to far greater strides for our people in the years ahead.
Here in this city of your magnificent history, we must always remember that we too are ancestors. Some day our children and their children will ask if we did all we could to build just societies and a more peaceful world.
Let our monuments be their judgment that we did that. Let our progress include all people with all their differences, moving toward a common destiny.
Let us give new meaning to the words written in the ancient Book of Rites, what you call the Li Jing, "When the great way is followed, all under heaven will be equal."

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT: THE OPINION -- JUSTICES, 6-3, BAR VETO OF LINE ITEMS IN BILLS; SEE H.I.V. AS DISABILITY;
RULING ON BIAS LAW

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
People with H.I.V. infection can be covered by the Federal law that bars discrimination on the basis of disability even if they have no symptoms, the Supreme Court ruled today in a major victory for people with the virus that causes AIDS.
Voting 5 to 4, the Justices agreed with a Federal appeals court's ruling that a woman with asymptomatic H.I.V. infection, who was refused care in a dentist's office, met the definition of disability under the Americans With Disabilities Act. 
 The Court stopped short of ruling flatly that H.I.V. infection is automatically covered by the disability law, a question that Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's majority opinion said was not necessary to the decision. There is no dispute that people with full-blown AIDS are disabled within the meaning of the 1990 law.
The majority held that the woman's decision not to have children because of her H.I.V.-positive status brought her within the law's definition of disability: an impairment that "substantially limits" one or more "major life activities." Reproduction is such an activity, Justice Kennedy said. Excerpts, page A19.
Although the opinion's scope was limited, its tone suggested that in subsequent cases, all or almost all H.I.V.-positive people would be able to claim the law's protection. "Major life activities" is a broad phrase that should be broadly interpreted in light of the prospect of inevitable progression to a "dread and fatal disease," Justice Kennedy said.
Beyond its application to the nearly one million people in the United States who are H.I.V.-positive, the decision was important as the Court's first substantive review of the eight-year-old disability law. The Court's analysis suggested that the law would also cover other conditions that some lower courts have regarded as beyond its scope, including infertility, well-controlled diabetes and cancer that is in remission after treatment. Justice Kennedy said it was not necessary for a life activity that is compromised by an impairment to have a "public, economic or daily character."
The majority opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist dissented, as did Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Sandra Day O'Connor. The dissenters said that reproduction was not a major life activity and that in any event the ability to have a child was not "substantially limited" by H.I.V. infection in the way the law used that phrase.
The decision, Bragdon v. Abbott, No. 97-156, was short of a complete victory for the patient, Sidney Abbott, who brought the lawsuit in 1994. After finding that she was covered by the law, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit went on to rule that despite his fear of infection, the dentist, Randon Bragdon, had illegally discriminated against her by refusing to treat her in his office, in Bangor, Me.
The Justices vacated that final part of the ruling today, however, ordering the appeals court, which sits in Boston, to take further evidence on the question of risk. The disability act provides an exception under which a person with an infectious condition need not be treated if the condition "poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others," defined as a "significant risk" that cannot be eliminated by appropriate procedures.
Justice Kennedy said that within the scope of this appeal, the Supreme Court had not been able to review evidence on this question. He said such evidence should be limited to "objective, scientific information," in particular the views of public health authorities.
This in itself was an important part of the ruling, because the Court rejected Dr. Bragdon's argument that the judgment of risk could be made by the individual practitioner. Dr. Bragdon's own view should receive "no special deference simply because he is a health care professional," Justice Kennedy said, adding that "his belief that a significant risk existed, even if maintained in good faith, would not relieve him" of liability if broadly accepted medical evidence was to the contrary.
Lawyers for Ms. Abbott said they were confident they would prevail in the renewed lower court proceedings, in light of the views of leading public health authorities on the safety of treating H.I.V.-positive patients and the absence of evidence that any patient had ever transmitted H.I.V. infection to a dentist. The Clinton Administration, which entered the case in support of Ms. Abbott, told the Court that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had "found the risk of H.I.V. transmission in the dental context so low as to be unquantifiable."
In his dissenting opinion, however, Chief Justice Rehnquist said that given evidence that patients had transmitted the virus to health care workers on 42 documented occasions, it was likely that Dr. Bragdon could establish that it was "objectively reasonable" for him to refuse to treat an infected patient in his office.
The dentist, alerted by Ms. Abbott's disclosure on a new-patient information form that she had H.I.V., had offered to fill her cavity in a hospital, where in fact he did not have privileges to practice. It was at that point that she filed suit.
Her lawyer, Bennett H. Klein of Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, a Boston public interest law firm, said he was "elated" by the decision today, which he said would send a strong signal to lower courts that all H.I.V.-positive people are protected under the law.
The 1990 law offers broad protection against discrimination on the basis of disability in employment and places of public accommodation, which are defined as including medical offices. A related law, the National Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988, uses the same definition of disability to bar housing discrimination.
Matthew Coles, director of the AIDS Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the decision was important in demonstrating that the Court was willing to look at "the basic purpose of the Americans With Disabilities Act." Contrary to many narrow lower court interpretations, he said, the law was intended to be read "not like an antitrust regulation but like a civil rights law."
Ann Elizabeth Reesman, a lawyer here who filed a brief on behalf of an employer group urging the Court to reject reproduction as a "major life activity," said the ruling had significantly broadened the scope of the law. Employers will most likely find the decision troublesome, she said, because "reproduction is such a broad term that it will be more difficult to tell who is covered and what employers' obligations are."

Local Bells See Bright Side In AT&T-TCI Merger Deal
Shares of the five local Bell telephone companies dropped by almost 4 percent on average, shaving about $11 billion from their combined market value one day after AT&T agreed to acquire Tele-Communications Inc. for $31.8 billion. 
 The decline was attributed to AT&T's lessened need for the Bells' networks to reach local customers once it gains access to TCI's extensive cable system, which reaches 10.5 million homes. The local Bells, however, think the merger will help them enter the $80 billion long-distance market, something they have sought to do. News Analysis. Page D3.

Sunbeam Facing a Bleak Outlook
Shares of Sunbeam have plummeted 42 percent since the board of the appliance maker dismissed its chief executive, Albert J. Dunlap, two weeks ago.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Little Changed In Light Trading as Dollar Gains

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices pared early losses and ended little changed yesterday, as the dollar gained in currency trading against the yen. Prices were also weakened by dealers' hedging Freddie Mac's $4 billion global bond offering yesterday.
But trading volume in the Treasury market was nearly half of the average for a Thursday in the second quarter, so price movements are exaggerated somewhat. 
 The price of the 30-year bond edged up 2/32 , to 106 24/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, slipped to 5.65 percent, from 5.66 percent on Wednesday.
Treasury prices came under pressure as underwriters led by Bear, Stearns & Company, J. P. Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney sold the five-year Freddie Mac note issue at a price to yield 5.77 percent, or about 26 basis points over the new five-year Treasury note sold Wednesday. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)
Also weighing on the market was slightly stronger than expected housing data, early weakness in the dollar against the Japanese yen, a strong stock market that gave back a good chunk of its gains during the day, supply and technical factors.
Traders said shorter-maturity bills were in strong demand for the most part as the three-month bill rate dropped below 5 percent on a variety of factors, including end-of-the-quarter demand.
Treasury prices fell early in the session after the Commerce Department said gross domestic product increased at a seasonally adjusted 5.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter, much higher than its estimate of 4.8 percent a month ago.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said "despite still-booming home sales, the somewhat surprising, upward revised 5.4 percent G.D.P, statistic, while subject to further change with next month's annual revisions, certainly demonstrated the economy's torrid expansion during the first quarter was likely to slow substantially, due mainly to an inventory overhang."
"Furthermore," he said, "economic activity seems to be encountering some head winds at the onset of the third quarter in the forms of sagging durable goods orders, the G.M. strike, and an ever-widening trade deficit."
Mr. Fine said he expected that Federal Reserve policy makers would keep monetary policy unchanged at its two-day meeting next week because of benign inflation, a growing budget surplus, strong dollar and continued turmoil in Asia.

Computer Profits Outlook Cuts 2-Week Rally's Gains

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, led by Intel and Microsoft, on renewed concern about profits for the computer industry's bellwethers.
An afternoon slump in the two stocks pulled the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down from a record, and took the steam out of a two-week rally in computer shares. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.71, to 8,935.58, losing most of a 101.14-point gain that took the average above 9,000 for the first time since June 10. The Dow would have fallen if not for a gain in Union Carbide. The S.& P. index fell 3.60, to 1,129.28. The Nasdaq composite index fell 14.51 points, to 1,863.25.
Investors are "waiting for corporate profits to get over this hump," said Dirk van Dijk, equity strategist at C. H. Dean & Associates in Dayton, Ohio, which oversees $5 billion.
Operating earnings in the second quarter for the companies in the S.& P. 500 are expected to rise about 3.5 percent, compared with 8.9 percent a year earlier, according to I.B.E.S. International Inc. That's better than the first quarter's 1.5 percent rise, which was the worst in seven years, but far from the gains of 10 percent or more in 21 of the previous 25 quarters.
Investors put money into some stocks that lagged in recent weeks, including Union Carbide, up 4 1/4, to 52 1/4. James Hickman, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said that after meeting with Union Carbide he expects management to cut costs in coming months.
Some investors expect the market to revive as second-quarter earnings reports begin in the middle of next month. "This earnings season is going to be strong, so I think we're really in for a summer rally in the stock market," said Robert Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Zurich Kemper Investments Inc.
Intel, the world's biggest computer-chip maker, and Microsoft, the No. 1 independent maker of personal computer software, led stocks' gains this week as investors concluded that demand for their products would revive in the second half of the year. The companies had slumped with other computer stocks as Asia's slowdown hurt business. In the previous nine days, though, Microsoft soared 23 percent.
"There reaches a point where people say this is too much too soon," said Larry Wachtel, a stock market analyst for Prudential Securities Inc. "We've had an enormous move in the big-cap stocks."
Microsoft fell 3 3/8, to 101 9/16 . Intel dropped 1 3/4, to 75 5/8. While Intel did not warn of a profit shortfall for the current quarter, as some feared, investors said they were reluctant to bid the shares higher without assurance that the glut of personal computers will ease in the second half.

Oil Prices Break 4-Day Rally On Skepticism Over OPEC Cuts

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Crude oil snapped a four-day rally yesterday and fell almost 4 percent on skepticism that oil producers would follow through on promises to cut production by 3.2 million barrels a day and reduce a global supply glut.
Traders said they thought that steeper cuts yet were needed because of the history of some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' ignoring quotas to which they had agreed. 
 "The market really hasn't given these cuts much credibility because they're discounting them by 50 percent," said Alan Struth, chief economist at Phillips Petroleum in Bartlesville, Okla. He said OPEC had only been able to cut about 50 to 60 percent "of what they say they will."
In trading yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for August delivery fell 57 cents a barrel, to $14.03, partly erasing the $1.47 in gains made over the previous four trading days on optimistic expectations about OPEC's intentions to curtail production.
On Wednesday night, the producers' organization, meeting in Vienna, increased the size of cutbacks promised for this year to 2.6 million barrels a day. Non-OPEC producers, led by Mexico and Norway, have also pledged some reductions, which would bring the intended output reductions to 3.2 million barrels.
But global inventories remain ample, partly reflecting a slowdown in demand from economically troubled Asian countries.
In addition, Iraq, which exports crude oil under a United Nations-negotiated oil-for-food program, has negated much of the others' cuts with increased exports.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE VILLAGE;
In a Schoolyard Near Xian, a Grass-Roots Moment

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: XIAN, China, Friday, June 26

 BODY:
The President led a schoolyard discussion today in Xiahe, about 30 miles east of Xian and adjacent to the famed archeological site of the terra-cotta warriors buried in the tomb of Emperor Qin Shihuang.
The President heard from a carefully selected group of citizens of Xiahe and nearby towns: a schoolteacher, a clinic worker, a restaurant owner and the manager of a factory that produces souvenir replicas of the terra cotta warriors. 
 The President listened intently, asking whether Government policies had led to growing prosperity in the village, educational levels and the challenges of running a small business in the booming economy.
Xiahe is a village of 400 people. One man told the President that his family's annual income had exploded to 30,000 yuan from 1,000 yuan before 1982.
Mr. Clinton also took questions. A restaurant owner asked him why he was holding such a discussion.
"For two reasons," the President answered. "First of all, I think it's important for people in positions like mine, in the United States and China, understand how people live at what we call the grass-roots level and understand how the policies we make affect the way people live and the lives of ordinary citizens."
He continued, "And secondly, because the American people are very interested in learning more about the Chinese people as a result of my trip. So when we do this there will be pictures and reports of this meeting in America so people just like you in America will have a feeling for what it's like to be a teacher or run a restaurant or work with old people."
Asked about Taiwan, Mr. Clinton said, "It's obvious there will be no change in our position one way or the other on this trip."
 Next on the itinerary for the Clintons is a tour of Emperor Qin's tomb.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE SCENE;
Xian Turns Out, and It Wasn't Even Compulsory

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: XIAN, China, June 25

 BODY:
On this steamy summer night, the people of Xian took to the streets to welcome President Clinton on the first stop of his state visit, in what many here said was one of the largest spontaneous gatherings they could remember.
"There's never been another event like this here -- I don't think I've ever seen this many people come out for anything," said Sun Qinqi, an engineer, who said he had decided to pass up the World Cup soccer game to cram onto the sidewalk just inside the Old City's South Gate to catch a glimpse of the Presidential motorcade's arrival. 
 He scanned the high-spirited crowd wondering aloud: Did more people turn out to celebrate the arrest of the infamous Gang of Four in 1976, which brought the decade-long Cultural Revolution to an end? Were there more in the spring of 1989, when people gathered to express sympathy for demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in Beijing?
"No," he concluded, "there just weren't so many then."
As early as 9 this morning, factory workers, students, bankers and public officials started vying for position on the sidewalks around the square before the South Gate, where the President was to give a short speech. And by this evening, a crowd five deep extended out of the square for two miles down South Avenue, along the route Mr. Clinton was rumored to be taking back to his hotel.
Despite a huge police presence, the green-uniformed officers stoically tolerated a large, ebullient crowd of spectators, including some perching in trees and atop newspaper kiosks. They watched as men in Adidas shirts and women carrying beepers jumped blithely over the barricades in front of Kentucky Fried Chicken to applaud when the President's black limousine, bearing American and Chinese flags, finally passed.
It was a heady evening for Xian, the once-proud capital of ancient China but in recent years plagued by a stagnant economy and hundreds of thousands of layoffs. Indeed, many enthusiasts expressed hope that Mr. Clinton's visit would help restore Xian's name -- or at least bring new business to town.
On the street tonight, few seemed to mind that they could neither see the elaborate welcoming ceremony nor hear the President speak.
Gu Fuyin, a factory director, and his wife, Cao Mingli, had dressed up, brought stools and waited four hours to catch a glimpse of the motorcade. Some work places had urged their employees to be welcoming toward Mr. Clinton. Nonetheless, the middle-aged couple marveled at a celebration that was "spontaneous" and "not required by politics."
"The two country's relations are developing quickly, and now we are feeling much more friendly," Mr. Gu explained.
Ren Liansheng, 25, a Xian native who works on a construction project in Gansu, took off three days to attend the event, because "this is great for Xian, to promote economic development."
And Li Yuhua, 45, a factory worker in a flower-print dress who was crammed onto the sidewalk just across from the South Gate, only slightly overstepped the mood of the crowd when she exclaimed: "He's young and he's achieved so much. And we hope he'll achieve more. He's an epic-making man."
Even before the Clinton's plane touched down, shopkeepers could feel the benefits of his visit.
On Wenyibei Street, a bustling commercial street outside the city wall, Jia Jiwan, 34, had decorated the window of his fashionable clothing store with pictures of the President.
"We always say we should grasp the opportunity to reinvigorate the economy, and this is like a windfall," he said. "So this visit could be a turning point. Afterward, Xian -- and its products -- will be better known in the world."
At a small outdoor market near Xian's beautifully ornate 18th-century Bell Tower, Lu Xiurong, 47, said the impending arrival of Mr. Clinton had done wonders for her business, which sells children's clothes, skimpy underwear and bras.
"We were just saying how happy we were he is coming," said Ms. Lu. "When the people are in a good mood, as they are now, they wander through the market and buy." She said sales had increased 60 percent in the last two weeks, with American-flag pajamas a best seller.
At the state-owned Foreign Language Bookstore, 200 copies of a Chinese book about President Jiang Zemin's visit to the United States last fall sold out in two days last week.
But other businesses did not fare so well.
Two months ago, a 45-year-old widow named Liu Guiqing who had been laid off from a candy factory paid $100 for a pedicab that she drove to support her two children.
But on June 1, the Xian police informed Ms. Liu and other pedicab drivers that their cabs were old-fashioned and could no longer operate in the city center. The move supposedly was intended to relieve Xian's traffic congestion, but she and many others say the impending Clinton visit was to blame.
With no other way to make money, Ms. Liu has decided to take a chance, to earn a few dollars a night. In a city center now devoid of pedicabs, she goes out after nightfall and turns down rides that involve traveling on main thoroughfares.
"I have seen a few police trucks, but they have so far left me alone," she said. "I think it's because I am a woman."
Also on Wednesday, as Mr. Clinton was traveling to Xian, Fu Sheng was aboard a train out of the city, to the seaport of Qingdao. Mr. Fu, 38, who in 1989 had led Xian workers in a demonstration to support the protests in Beijing, was ordered to leave town before the President's arrival.
Three times in recent weeks, the party secretary at Mr. Fu's work place, the Xian Institute of Navigation, gave him the choice of being laid off or going to Qingdao.
When he finally left, he was accompanied by a co-worker assigned to make sure that he arrived at his destination. But he was upset that he had to leave Xian while his wife had to work and his 9-year-old was preparing for examinations.
"The meeting between the Americans and the Chinese is a good thing, another handshake," he said before his departure. "But why have authorities violated my rights?"

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton Starts Visit to China By Answering Critics in U.S.

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: XIAN, China, June 25

 BODY:
With the pageantry of thundering drums and clanging gongs, President Clinton was welcomed to China tonight, the first American President to visit this country in nearly a decade, and he mildly rebuked critics in Washington who have attacked his policy of engagement with Beijing.
"There may be those here and back in America who wonder whether closer ties and deeper friendship between America and China are good," the President said, speaking as much to his audience at home as to the throngs of Chinese who poured into the streets of Xian today to give Mr. Clinton a tumultuous welcome. 
 "Clearly, the answer is yes," the President said. "We can learn much from each other. And as two great nations, we have a special responsibility to the future of the world. The steps we take over the next week can lead to far greater strides for our people in the years ahead." Excerpt, page A8.
 On Friday morning, the President met with some of the residents of a nearby village to "understand how people live at what we call the grass-roots level."
The 30-minute arrival ceremony was a made-for-TV spectacle, for both the Chinese and American audiences, replete with warriors in Tang dynasty costumes, a score of maidens in flowing white gowns bearing baskets of flowers, and yellow-robed riders astride strutting horses. Red paper lanterns hung from the lampposts and bright silk banners bearing images of mythical birds of good fortune flapped in the breeze on a mild smoggy night.
The crowds of factory workers, students, bankers and public officials began vying for position at 9 A.M. on the sidewalks around the square in front of the Old City's South Gate, where the President gave a short speech nearly 12 hours later. By evening, the crowd extended for two miles down South Avenue out of the square.
Still two days away from the formal part of his trip, a one-day summit conference with President Jiang Zemin in Beijing, Mr. Clinton did not dwell here on any of the major, substantive differences between China and the United States. Instead, he offered brief remarks that stressed the positive aspects of the way the Chinese-American relationship has developed since 1989, the year in which President Bush visited China and the Chinese Government used military force to crush pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square.
In addition to his diplomatically indirect reference to the political climate in the United States about China, recently inflamed on Capitol Hill over questions about illegal campaign contributions and the spread of nuclear weapons, Mr. Clinton offered a gentle reminder of the gulf between the two countries on matters of human rights.
"Respect for the worth, the dignity, the potential and the freedom of every citizen is a vital source of America's strength and success," the President said as army searchlights played in the sky above him. "In this global information age, where both economic growth and individual opportunity are based on ideas, a commitment to providing all human beings the opportunity to develop their full potential is vital to the strength and success of the new China, as well."
In Beijing, United States officials complained to the Chinese Government today over reports that several dissidents had been detained and others harassed in relation to President Clinton's state visit. President Clinton repeated this complaint in his remarks Friday morning.
But in Xian, which the White House chose for the first stop because it is a city without a strong political symbolism in modern times, the focus was on ceremony and on the enthusiastic welcome.
The President and Hillary Rodham Clinton, showing the effects of their 18-hour, 10,000-mile journey from Washington, made their way down 150 yards of red carpet to the base of Xian's flood-lit South Gate, part of the fortifications that once guarded the city, China's imperial capital for more than 1,000 years.
Xian's Mayor, Fang Xichu, officially welcomed "your excellency Mr. President and Mrs. President," and presented Mr. Clinton with a key to the city.
"Isn't it a delight when friends visit from afar?" Mr. Fang said, quoting Confucius.
The South Gate, also known as the Gate of Eternal Tranquillity, was built in 1317, 400 years after the end of the Tang dynasty, 618-907 A.D., a period many Chinese regard as a high point in their civilization.
The crowd in the large square facing the gate numbered only a few hundred, limited by security concerns. But thick throngs lined the route of Mr. Clinton's 50-car motorcade into the city from the airport.
Still, it was a moment to be savored for many in the crowd, a break from the routine and a sign of China's growing acceptance as a weighty world player.
"I've lived here more than 20 years and I've never seen as many people gathered for anything before," said Chang Yingxiao, a division chief in the Xian health bureau.
Chen Tong, a 13-year-old boy, came to the parade route to see Mr. Clinton's car and perhaps catch a glimpse of the President himself. "I very much like President Clinton, I even worship him," he said. Asked if he held any other Americans in such reverence, the boy answered, "George Washington and Michael Jordan."
In his remarks, the President made reference to the controversy raging in the United States over his nine-day, five-city trip to China. Nearly a third of the members of Congress had urged Mr. Clinton to delay the trip until charges of illegal Chinese contributions to the 1996 Democratic campaign and the transfer of missile technology to China had been resolved. Many human rights advocates object to his rewarding the Chinese Government with a state visit while thousands of political dissidents remain jailed.
Mr. Clinton -- whose aides have hoped to use the trip to project an image back to the United States of a prospering, striving China that poses new challenges for economic competition, not nuclear or ideological confrontation -- struck that tone from the first moments of his visit.
"Here, in this city famous for calligraphy, a new chapter in China's story is being written," he said. "We Americans admire your accomplishments, your economy, your hard work, creativity and vision, your efforts against hunger and poverty, your work with us on peace and stability in Korea and South Asia."
He added: "I believe both Chinese and Americans aspire to many of the same things: to provide for our families, to teach our children, to build our communities, to protect our Earth, to shape our own futures and pass brighter possibilities on to our children."

HEADLINE: Alarmists Overstate China Army Buildup

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Stop Playing by China's Rules" (Op-Ed, June 22), Robert Kagan and William Kristol cite the "alarming rate" at which China is increasing its defense spending and call for "reversing the decline" in American spending. But China's spending is difficult to tally accurately. 
 The International Institute for Strategic Studies puts 1991 Chinese spending at $19 billion. But with high inflation, the "threat" disappears. The nominal increase of 159 percent between 1986 and 1994 is a rise of only 4 percent in real terms.
With China's economy slowing because of the Asian financial crisis, the United States can safely continue to engage China without increasing its own military spending. Fears that an increase in Chinese spending is being used to implement long-dormant expansionist tendencies should not be ignored, but neither should they be overdramatized. What we see does not portend a gigantic buildup by a hostile country so much as an affordable, long-overdue upgrading of the military of the world's most-populous country.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
One Week After a Slump, S.& P. 500 Closes at a Record

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market finished a strong week yesterday, as blue-chip issues rode into record territory despite longstanding fears about the economic crisis in Asia.
Wall Street analysts continue to warn about a slowdown in corporate profits this year, partly because of Asia, but investors are sending most of the major stock indexes significantly higher. 
 After falling sharply just over a week ago, dropping nearly 5 percent below its record high, the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index soared this week to a record 1,133.20 yesterday, pushing the index up nearly 16.8 percent for the year.
The Dow Jones industrial average also gained, rising 231.67 points, or 2.7 percent this week, to close at 8,944.54, about 3 percent below its record of 9,211.84, set on May 13.
Technology stocks were even stronger, led by Microsoft, which soared about 10 percent this week after a Federal appeals court made a ruling in Microsoft's favor in the company's dispute with the Government over competition issues. The composite index of the Nasdaq stock market, where Microsoft trades, gained 88.24 points, or 4.9 percent, on the week to close at 1,869.53.
"We're in the midst of a summer rally," said Harvey B. Hirschhorn, the chief investment strategist at Stein Roe & Farnham in Chicago. "The market had been oversold for a while, but we're seeing a lot of support from the bond market, where yields are at a decades-long low."
Indeed, bond prices soared again yesterday, dropping the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond to 5.63 percent, close to its lowest level in nearly 30 years. Inflation fears continue to diminish, and a flood of cheap imports from Asia promises to keep prices low, traders believe.
As for share prices, yesterday's gains were meager, just 8.96 points on the Dow and 3.92 points in the S.& P. 500. But the weekly gains were an impressive show of confidence after months of seesaw trading over concerns that a slowdown in Asia would curb corporate profits.
Even with the Asian worries, a steady flow of Government reports depicting a vibrant American economy, with lower interest rates and soaring consumer confidence, has put investors in a jubilant mood.
Yesterday, for instance, the Government said consumer spending accelerated in May. That followed a Thursday report that the economy in the first quarter grew at an annual rate of 5.4 percent, the second-fastest pace in a decade.
Those kinds of numbers seem to have served as a counterweight to concerns about slowing profit growth at home, and the prospect of an even sharper pinch from falling demand for American-made goods in Asia.
Wall Street analysts say they believe that investors are overlooking the profit slowdown and banking on a powerful economy that will eventually create another wave of hefty profits in the near future.
But in recent weeks, Wall Street has been subjected to a steady stream of profit warnings. "We think the economy is in a profits recession," said Richard Bernstein, the chief quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch.
Joseph Abbott, a research manager at I.B.E.S. Inc., which tracks earnings, said that profits for the companies in the S.& P. 500 are projected to rise just 2.6 percent in the current second quarter, down from double-digit gains a year earlier.
And the strike at General Motors plants could cut that figure even more. Yesterday, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company lowered his second-quarter earnings estimate for G.M. If profits at G.M. are sharply reduced, in line with the Goldman forecast, I.B.E.S. says growth in S.& P. profits would shrink to just 1.6 percent in the quarter.
Charles Hill, who compiles forecasts for First Call Inc., said earnings expectations were falling at a faster-than-normal rate this quarter.
"We're seeing more negative pre-announcements," he said. "And there could be significant disappointments in the third and fourth quarters. Asia is certainly not going to get better that quickly."
Mr. Hirschhorn at Stein Roe projects that profit growth will decline in the third and fourth quarters largely because of rising wage and price pressures.
"We're not overly excited about the next 12 to 16 months," he said. "We've had nirvana, and now we're moving into post-nirvana."

HEADLINE: CBS to Sell Westinghouse Nuclear Units for $238 Million and Debts

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The CBS Corporation will sell its Westinghouse nuclear and government services operation to a joint venture formed by the Morrison Knudsen Corporation and a British nuclear-fuel processor, the companies said yesterday.
For CBS, which changed its name from the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in December, the sale rids the company of the last vestige of its industrial past. 
 For Morrison Knudsen, a $1.7 billion construction and engineering company based in Boise, Idaho, that came near to bankruptcy because of severe debt earlier this decade, the deal is a way to increase its nuclear business quickly.
For Westinghouse, it means a final end to speculation about its future. "We've worked under a lot of uncertainty in the last few months, and we are really glad it's over," said Charles W. Pryor Jr., who will remain Westinghouse president.
So is CBS management. Until last fall, CBS had said that it would spin its industrial businesses off to shareholders. Analysts had projected that even in a booming market, the entire group, which included conventional power systems and process controls, would garner no more than $3 a share; at an anticipated 700 million shares, that would have brought no more than $2.1 billion.
Under the agreement announced yesterday, Morrison Knudsen and British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. will pay $238 million in cash and assume $950 million in liabilities and other obligations of the nuclear operations.
Jack Bergen, a spokesman, said CBS would probably use the money to buy back stock and acquire more radio and outdoor media companies like Transportation Displays Inc., CBS's bus-stop advertising company.
The joint venture will retain the Westinghouse Electric name and will remain in Monroeville, Pa. Morrison Knudsen is providing $168 million of the $238 million in cash, but will assume only $30 million of the $950 million in liabilities. Still, it will get 60 percent of the equity in the company.
That structure may go a long way toward getting the deal approved by the United States Government.
"People are concerned about foreign countries having influence on the nuclear industry, and Morrison Knudsen probably had to be in control for this deal to fly here," said George Davies, an analyst with ADDco Investment Research who also owns Morrison Knudsen stock.
Indeed, that was the trump card that some American bidders for the company hoped they held. "This is an important strategic business, and it would be better if it had remained under 100 percent U.S. ownership," said Linden S. Blue, vice chairman of General Atomics, a San Diego company that had bid for Westinghouse.
William Wicker, a spokesman for the Energy Department, said, "We provided CBS with our assessment on the impact a sale might have on security, and they indicated willingness to address our concerns."
British Nuclear Fuels, a $2.5 billion company whose stock is owned by the British Government, is no stranger to American projects. Its American subsidiary, BNFL Inc., operates cleanup and decommissioning contracts at five Energy Department sites. "We have unique security relationships with the United States Government," said Thomas M. Crimmins Jr., BNFL president.
Nor are the companies strangers to each other. "Our ability to work together is proven," said Dennis R. Washington, Morrison Knudsen's chairman and largest shareholder, adding that his company and BNFL were already teamed up on a project to clean up the Energy Department's Rocky Flats plant near Denver and that Morrison Knudsen and Westinghouse had worked together on projects at the department's Savannah River plant.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japan Waits As 2 Banks Weigh Merger

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 26

 BODY:
Long-Term Credit Bank, one of Japan's biggest and weakest financial institutions, is in negotiations to merge with a smaller, stronger rival, a move that could turn the combined bank into a showcase for the Government's first blueprint to clean up the nation's bad debt.
If Long-Term's talks with the Sumitomo Trust and Banking Company succeed, it would create a bank with $316 billion in assets, slightly behind the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the biggest bank in the United States with $364.7 billion in assets. It could also end weeks of worries that financial troubles at Long-Term could spread and endanger financial stability in Japan, which is already suffering from its worst postwar economic performance, a weakening currency and a jittery stock market. 
 "We have a bit of a crisis of confidence in the financial system, and confidence needs to be restored," said James P. Fiorillo, a financial analyst at ING Barings. "Investors have demanded action and they're getting it."
Japanese news media reported today that a deal was possible, and both banks confirmed later in separate news conferences that they were in talks.
The deal would effectively mean that Sumitomo Trust, with $118 billion in assets, would absorb Long-Term, the nation's 10th-largest financial institution, with $198 billion in assets. Though trading was halted in the stocks of the two companies after word of the talks appeared, Long-Term shares rose nearly 26 percent. Sumitomo shares fell 3 percent.
Koichi Kato, secretary general of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, welcomed the talks, though he denied reports that party leaders had helped broker the negotiations. Nonetheless, a deal would offer a timely opportunity for the Government to put into practice a blueprint it calls the Total Plan, aimed at tackling the nation's $600 billion in bad debt held by banks. The debt is considered an underlying cause of Japan's economic malaise.
As part of that plan, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto today ordered details to be drawn up for the establishment of a "bridge bank" to assume the loans and clients of a failed institution. It would operate like the Resolution Trust Corporation, set up by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation aimed at resolving the 1980's savings and loan crisis in the United States.
A deal between Sumitomo Trust and Long-Term is by no means certain. The talks have already raised questions about the role of the Swiss Bank Corporation, which just began joint ventures with Long-Term in asset management and securities.
Sumitomo Trust officials, who said they had been approached by Long-Term about a merger, suggested tonight that Sumitomo itself was interested in becoming a "global player."
Sumitomo is one of Japan's largest trust banks, which manage funds for large institutional investors.
Long-Term is one of three Japanese credit banks established at the end of World War II to provide long-term business loans in an effort to rebuild Japan's economy.
Bankers and analysts say Long-Term had been facing difficulty securing funds in the interbank loan market, a critical source of fund-raising for banks. Today the bank said it had met routine repayments on five-year and one-year debt securities, worth roughly $2.8 billion. Long-Term's president, Katsunobu Ohnogi, insisted today that the bank was "not insolvent."
But analysts say that some foreign financial institutions, concerned about Long-Term's health, were not eager to continue purchasing the bank's debt securities. Moreover, such concerns make the bank highly vulnerable to any sudden shocks, so that it needs to conclude a rescue deal quickly.
The success of the deal would depend partly on the degree of public funds Sumitomo could get from the Government in exchange for absorbing Long-Term, which has about $10.4 billion in bad loans. Sumitomo, which itself has $8 billion in problem loans, said today that it had no plans to take over Long-Term's bad debt.
Atsushi Takahashi, president of Sumitomo, said he had received assurances from the governor of the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, and from the commissioner of the Financial Supervisory Agency, that Sumitomo would receive full support if it absorbed Long-Term.
"We don't set a deadline for the merger," Mr. Takahashi said at a news conference. "I think the merger would be better if it comes earlier."
In fact, there has been concern that Long-Term may be burdened by problems with its affiliate leasing and financing companies, which bankers say have billions of dollars worth of outstanding loans -- many of them property-related.
Bankers say one reason for Sumitomo's decision to negotiate with Long-Term may have been that it, too, has large amounts of outstanding loans to affiliate companies of Long-Term. So, by rescuing Long-Term, Sumitomo may be seeking to avoid greater troubles of its own.
In any case, Mr. Takahashi made it clear that if the talks succeeded, Sumitomo would run the operation.
Some analysts worried that the proposed takeover was a reversion to the old style of arranged unions. Others suggested that if the Government created a bridge bank that took over Long-Term's bad loans, and if Sumitomo received public money to help it manage the expanded institution, then Long-Term's shareholders might lose out and the value of their shares could plummet.
In contrast to the United States, where investors generally like to own stocks in companies that are rescued, in Japan, the opposite could happen.
"If it is decided that LTCB shareholders lose everything, then immediately, the market will divide the Japanese banks into the predators and the prey," said Brian J. Waterhouse, financial analyst at HSBC Securities Japan Ltd. "And the prey, you don't want to own."

HEADLINE: Editorial Observer;
Is Viktor Orban Too Old to Lead Hungary?

BYLINE: By TINA ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
Viktor Orban, the Prime Minister-designate of Hungary, celebrated his 35th birthday last month, and many are wondering if power has not found him too late. Across the former East Bloc some of the most dynamic, Westernized politicians are relatively youthful. The most influential are Sergei Kiriyenko, Russia's 35-year-old reformist Prime Minister, and his deputy Boris Nemtsov, 38. In American terms they are free-market Republicans on economics, liberal Democrats on social issues. Mr. Orban, whose statist politics are just the reverse, was like them once, back when he was young.
In the early 1990's Mr. Orban's party, the Federation of Young Democrats, or Fidesz, was the most popular in Hungary. Its selling point was that it was open only to those under 35. Hungary's youth grew up in a free and Westernized country by Communist standards, without the listlessness of those who lived under a harsher regime. To voters, youth meant energy and efficiency. It meant Europe. 
 Fidesz was born at a Budapest college that Mr. Orban and several other students established in the early 1980's so they could study democracy, largely in English. Once Communism fell, the students formed Fidesz. Hungary already had a party of Vaclav Havel-type dissidents, but many Hungarians considered them soft and naive, and disdained their warnings about the shallowness of capitalist society.
"For years, the dissidents based their politics on morality, not the political game," Mr. Orban told me in an interview in 1992. "That is in the nature of the underground, and they have not been able to change."
Fidesz, by contrast, was a party of Thatcherite sharks. Led by the brash and arrogant Mr. Orban, its politicians dressed like models -- one parliamentarian posed for a Levi's ad -- and held campaign rock concerts. While other parties' TV ads resembled the old Commie spots urging increased potato production, Fidesz ads looked like MTV. They were produced by the East Bloc's first political consulting firm, which Fidesz, touchingly naive about its cynicism, publicly touted as a great stride westward.
But in the next elections, in 1994, Fidesz did poorly. Hungarians liked the image of Fidesz, but in an era of economic trouble did not want to see their social programs cut. Mr. Orban began to revise his ideas. Some Fidesz members split off and joined the traditional dissident party. Those who remained emulated Mr. Orban's about-face. He is now an economic populist and on social issues takes a conservative Catholic line. The party no longer has an age limit.
As Prime Minister he will lead a coalition that includes a party of small farmers, which has endorsed such dubious ideas as a ban on foreign ownership of land. Mr. Orban himself has made some alarmingly nationalist statements and unrealistic economic promises. The day after the elections, Hungary's stock market dropped 8.7 percent. Now he is once again shifting positions, trying to reassure foreign investors that they should keep flooding Hungary. The stock market has bounced back.
Mr. Orban's politics may yet lurch a few more times before his career is over, but so far, political expediency seems to have trumped youth. Age is not a foolproof predictor of politics. The worst leader in the former Communist world is probably Belarus's President, Aleksandr Lukashenko. A former director of a state farm, he speaks of his admiration for Hitler and Stalin. His policies are firmly frozen in the 1950's. He is 43.

HEADLINE: A Clear Ruling on Harassment

 BODY:
With a pair of 7-to-2 decisions yesterday, the Supreme Court ended its term on a constructive note by strengthening the law governing sexual harassment in the workplace. The rulings, in cases from Boca Raton, Fla., and Chicago, reasonably interpreted Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to hold that an employer can be held liable for sexual misconduct by supervisors, whether or not the employer knew about it. The Court also said the employer can be liable whether or not the employee suffered adverse job consequences for refusing a supervisor's unwelcome advances.
The rulings properly recognize that language in the statute defining the term "employer" includes both employers and their "agents." They are also an acknowledgment that sexual harassment causes serious harm even when there is no provable job retaliation or economic loss. However, the Court's balanced approach left room for employers to mount a successful defense by, for example, showing that employees had "unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer." 
 The ruling seems unlikely to have much impact on Paula Jones's sexual-harassment suit against President Clinton. Her lawyers hope to be helped by the Court's holding that victims who suffer no tangible economic harm may still bring a lawsuit. But in dismissing her case, Federal Judge Susan Webber Wright found that Mr. Clinton had never made a clear threat, which remains a prerequisite for her claim of harassment.
The new rulings make an earlier sexual harassment decision by the Court this week look all the worse. That ruling, applying an analogous statute, effectively deprived students harassed in school of any effective legal remedy. Congress still has the power to correct that mistake, and it should.

HEADLINE: Bolivia's Crackdown on Coca Growers Becomes Increasingly Deadly

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: VILLA ROSARIO, Bolivia

 BODY:
Coca growers ambushed a drug-eradication team near this rebellious hamlet one day early this month, leaving one policeman dead and three wounded. The next day 600 soldiers and policemen barreled through the jungle in a show of force.
With two armed helicopters hovering overhead, the security forces slashed 10 acres of coca bushes with machetes. The hamlet was virtually empty but the police arrested a single straggler who they said was carrying a dynamite fuse. 
 "We've returned to show the cocaleros we will not be stopped," Army Lieut. Col. Jorge Antello, 44, the commander of the operation, told a reporter, as soldiers trained their rifles at the surrounding foliage.
Such expressions of determination in the battle against cocaine represent a break from the past -- even though many of the soldiers did take dried coca leaves from town to chew, then or later.
Still, the official determination to do away with coca is a change. Only six years ago, a Bolivian President wore a pin shaped like a coca leaf on his lapel, symbolizing years of half-hearted efforts against drugs that drove United States officials to distraction. Last year, Washington came close to denying Bolivia the label of a country committed to fighting drugs and cutting off tens of millions of dollars in aid, but at the last moment La Paz fulfilled a United States-set coca eradication quota.
Then suddenly, in January, the new Bolivian President, the retired general Hugo Banzer Suarez, pledged to wipe out every illegal coca plant by the end of his term, in 2002. In Bolivia, illegal plants are defined as those planted since 1988, in areas where international traffickers operate. After six months, his stepped-up efforts have won praise from the Clinton Administration and United Nations officials.
But the efforts have set off increasing violence by coca growers, including blockades of crucial roads and ambushes against the security forces here in Chapare, a region the size of New Jersey where one-quarter of the world's cocaine supply originates.
Under President Banzer's program, 90,000 acres of coca fields will be destroyed in the next four years at a cost of $108 million, with another $700 million going to providing basic improvements like roads and granting credits and training of farmers to grow alternative crops. Government officials said they expect that much of the funding will come from the United States, along with sizable contributions from the European Community and the United Nations.
In a reversal of past Government policy, President Banzer has pledged to phase out payments to coca growers for voluntarily eradicating their illegal crops. During the last several years, coca farmers have been paid $2,500 for every 2.5 acres they eradicate, in a program that has cost American taxpayers nearly $100 million over the last decade.
But United States and Bolivian officials said many of the farmers took the money and then cultivated just as much coca acreage deeper in the jungle. Bolivia had 113,200 acres of coca under cultivation in 1997, according to the Central Intelligence Agency, just 3 percent less than it had in 1993. State Department officials, tired of subsidizing coca growers, pushed hard for the policy change.
Under the new strategy, farmers will be paid nothing and smaller payments will go to the communities for resettlement and social programs until there is a complete cutoff in 2002. Government officials said the savings will go into law enforcement and economic development, but they concede that the policy is unpopular among coca farmers.
"By the year 2002, cocaine will be worthless in Bolivia," the Interior Minister, Guido Nayar Parada, asserted in an interview. "The armed resistance by the cocaleros only shows that we are having an impact and we will not be deterred from applying the law."
While United States officials here love to hear such unqualified commitment, they caution that it will take much to overcome years of disappointments. A State Department official said that despite improvements in eradication, only 1 percent of the cocaine base now being produced in Chapare is being intercepted. The figure is so low, he said, because the police patrol traffickers' routes during the day but not at night, and because corrupt police officers are allowing illegal cargoes through road blocks.
United States officials note that although cultivating new coca fields has been illegal since 1988, only a handful of the 40,000 coca growers in the country have been arrested.
And while United States officials compliment the Government for pressing projects to replace coca crops with legal crops like pineapples and bananas, they warn that it will be difficult to wean peasants off a coca crop that is resistant to tropical funguses and floods, offers a predictable market, and can be harvested four times a year with little effort.
Meanwhile the Americans say that ambushes of the police -- there have been nine since April 2, killing 3 policemen and wounding 15 -- have slowed eradication efforts. The Bolivian Government is now forced to mobilize far larger forces in eradication sweeps, which are slower and more costly. Leaders of six coca grower unions say 12 growers have been killed during confrontations with the security forces in recent months, while the Government admits to only two.
But United States officials also see reasons for optimism. They note that a growing number of peasant groups are signing agreements with the Government to eradicate their coca crops. And a Bolivian anti-terrorism unit, trained and financed by the C.I.A., began operating in the Chapare recently and is making an impact.
The unit has captured a list of terrorist leaders and a code book for terrorist operations belonging to one of the six coca unions that are planting illegal crops in a national park, according to Bolivian Army and State Department officials.
President Banzer's ambitious plan comes at a time when Bolivia's role in the drug world is going through a rapid transformation. Only three years ago, traffickers from the Cali cartel in Colombia bought coca base and paste from Bolivian middlemen and moved it to Colombia for processing. The drugs then moved through Mexico and the Caribbean to the United States market.
But with the arrests of the top Cali leaders and Peru's decision to shoot down cocaine flights, smaller Colombian organizations that have replaced the cartel have stepped up coca cultivation at home. That has made Bolivian coca far less important to international traffickers. The trend should help President Banzer's efforts, even if it is unlikely to make a dent in the drug trade on the streets of American cities.
"If we can't achieve our objectives in Bolivia with the help we are getting from this Government," a senior United States Embassy official said, "we can't succeed anywhere in South America."

HEADLINE: Money and Other Hardening Positions in Strikes at G.M.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich., June 26

 BODY:
Losses to the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union from strikes at two parts factories here have soared far beyond the actual money involved at the factories, making it harder with each passing day for either side to paint an eventual settlement as a victory.
Wall Street analysts now estimate G.M.'s after-tax costs from the strikes at $1 billion, and rising by $75 million a day, while the U.A.W.'s members have lost more than $150 million in pay. Based on previous strikes, G.M. and its workers can expect to recoup up to half their losses through extra production and overtime pay in the months after the strikes. But the rest of the losses are likely to be permanent, as customers buy Ford Expeditions and Toyota Camrys instead of Chevrolet Suburbans and Luminas. 
 By contrast, the issues in the strike negotiations here involve sums in the tens of millions of dollars. But as the strikes lengthen, each side has also begun to see them as a showdown over the future course of labor-management relations at the world's largest auto maker, making it much harder to settle.
For the U.A.W. to declare victory after the strikes, it must be able to reassure members that it is doing as much as possible to slow G.M.'s steady elimination of jobs in the United States. But the union faces a difficult task in controlling the expectations of workers who, much more than the union's leadership, see the strikes as a way to force G.M. to back away from its plans to expand production overseas.
G.M. faces a more difficult task. It must convince skeptical institutional investors and Wall Street analysts that a settlement here will allow it to shrink its work force at other factories without further costly strikes. "I want to be able to sleep at night knowing that G.M. can downsize without having a strike," said Nicholas Lobaccaro, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch.
Companies with steady increases in earnings, quarter after quarter, have been rewarded by Wall Street with fast-rising share prices. Mainly because of 16 strikes over the last five years, G.M.'s quarterly earnings have zigzagged unpredictably, with record profits alternating with heavy losses.
With the U.A.W. now threatening strikes in Indiana and Ohio after any settlement here, G.M.'s stock has been weakening, and its price has dropped 11.4 percent since the first strike June 5, even as the share price at its rival the Ford Motor Company has risen 6.2 percent.
Wall Street analysts assert that G.M. needs to shrink its work force because the auto maker's uninspiring designs are capturing a shrinking share of the market. G.M. held 40 percent of the market a decade ago but has been bouncing around 30 percent in the last year. That means G.M. needs to produce about 1.5 million fewer vehicles even in good years, so fewer workers are needed. G.M. closed some factories during the last recession in the early 1990's, but still has the manufacturing capacity and work force to supply 35 percent of the market, rather than 30 percent.
Auto analysts look at these figures and want the strikes to end with an acknowledgment by the U.A.W. that G.M. is in trouble. "What is necessary is a public recognition by the union leadership, that is communicated to the rank and file, that G.M.'s situation is serious enough that we need to all collectively work together to put the company back on a competitive footing," said Joseph S. Phillippi at Lehman Brothers, who predicted today that the strikes could last at least until mid-August.
G.M. has taken the unusual step in the strikes of publicly criticizing the union's leadership in a bid to convince U.A.W. members that the company has a problem. On Thursday, G.M. gave television stations here a videotape in which a top Flint factory manager explained how inefficient work practices cost the company money.
This strategy has predictably infuriated top U.A.W. officials, who were angry at G.M. even before the strike. Union leaders have said for months that workers are punished for bad decision-making by G.M. executives, such as the company's only now getting around to developing a sport utility vehicle and a midsize sedan for Saturn, its most successful brand. The union has also been upset that G.M. is trying to cut costs while still making some profits and paying top executives large bonuses.
The confrontational stance of G.M. executives has been the last straw for the union. "You've got some heroes in G.M. that are all of a sudden becoming stars and want to talk about they're going to do this and do that -- they're just not making any sense whatsoever," Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W.'s president, said on Thursday evening.
But the union's only weapon for fighting the company is a blunt one that hurts workers, too. A strong economy appears to have produced very strong auto sales this month, and G.M. dealerships had scant supplies of popular models when the strikes began. G.M. faces further loss of market share this summer for lack of cars and light trucks to sell. The strikes also threaten to delay G.M.'s introduction this fall of new full-size pickup trucks, a mainstay of its profits. And union leaders in Brazil warned today that some huge and highly profitable factories there might have to close soon for lack of parts from the United States.
Workers on the picket lines here recognize the costs of the strikes on all sides and are worried about the eventual settlement. "I don't think anybody's going to win," said one, Doris Motley, an operator of computerized stamping equipment. "They'll compromise, but that's about it."

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE ECONOMY;
China Tells U.S. It Won't Devalue Currency

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 26

 BODY:
A day before President Clinton's meeting with President Jiang Zemin, China today gave the United States fresh assurances that it does not plan to devalue its currency.
Playing economic advance man for Mr. Clinton, the Secretary of the Treasury, Robert E. Rubin, held a daylong series of meetings with senior Chinese officials here, in which he said "there were unambiguous statements of intent to maintain" the exchange rate of the Chinese currency, the yuan. 
 Persuading China to maintain a stable currency has become a top priority of the Clinton Administration, which fears that a devaluation by Beijing could spark another wave of copycat devaluations across Asia. Mr. Rubin praised China today for being an "island of stability" in a region buffeted by economic turmoil.
Countries that devalue their currency can usually sell their goods more competitively, and the concern of the United States and several other nations is that the Chinese would devalue to avoid losing markets to several other Asian countries whose currencies have been weakened by the economic crisis in the region.
Although today's meetings were held in Government offices in the heart of Beijing, the focus of the talks was more than 1,000 miles to the east, in Japan.
Asia's latest economic relapse was caused by a sharp decline in the Japanese yen, and Mr. Rubin used the meetings here to keep up the pressure on Japan to mend its fractured economy. He said the Chinese officials had told him that they were very concerned about the economic turmoil in Japan, in large part because the weak yen was having an "adverse impact on the region."
"I said that we, too, were deeply concerned about the economic condition in Japan," Mr. Rubin said in a briefing for reporters after he met Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, who is leading China's ambitious economic reforms.
The contrast between a stable, reform-minded China and a shaky, equivocating Japan has become a favorite theme of policy-makers and currency traders in recent months. While Mr. Rubin was careful not to criticize Japan, he drew some pointed distinctions between Beijing and Tokyo.
Of the Chinese decision not to devalue, Mr. Rubin said, "They were very prescient, and they are getting and deserve a great deal of respect in the world for this decision." Of Japan, he said, "I've not spoken to any person in the financial or political world who does not believe Japan must solve its problems."
Last week, the drop in the yen prompted the United States and Japan to prop up the value of the currency by buying $4 billion worth of yen in foreign exchange markets. Many financial experts believe that China played an influential role in forcing the intervention by complaining about how the weak yen was hurting its exports and by dropping hints that the yuan might have to be devalued.
Today, before their morning meeting, the governor of the central bank, Dai Xianglong, made a show of thanking Mr. Rubin for the intervention. Mr. Dai had been among the Chinese officials who raised alarms in recent weeks about how a weak yen was putting pressure on the yuan.
But the effects of the move have largely worn off. After a brief rebound, the yen has settled to about 142 to the dollar, and currency traders are once again betting on when the United States will be forced to buy yen to raise its value again.
Mr. Rubin was resolutely noncommittal today about whether the United States would continue propping up the yen. But he is known to be skeptical about the efficacy of such interventions. He would clearly prefer that Japan tackle its more deep-seated economic problems, which include a banking sector that staggers under $600 billion in bad loans and a web of onerous financial regulations.
As for China, Mr. Rubin said it, too, faced formidable economic challenges. Mr. Zhu is embarking on a broad reform of China's banking system, as well as privatizing thousands of state-owned enterprises.
"You certainly got the feeling of people who understand the problems," Mr. Rubin said.
He said the Chinese leaders were sticking to their forecast of 8 percent economic growth in 1998. But with exports dwindling and domestic demand sluggish, he added, "it's not clear where they expect to come out."
Mr. Rubin met Mr. Zhu in an ornate building called the Pavilion of Purple Light, purple being a color that the Chinese regard as auspicious. The setting was appropriate, for despite all the questions about China's economy, this was likely to be the most trouble-free stop on Mr. Rubin's trip. In the coming week, he will travel to Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea -- countries that are grappling with more nettlesome problems than slowing growth.
In Malaysia, Mr. Rubin will face a potentially unstable political environment. On Wednesday, the Malaysian Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, named his close adviser, Daim Zainuddin, as a Cabinet minister in charge of the economy. That would appear to undercut the Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who had overseen the economy and has been widely considered to be Mr. Mahathir's heir apparent.
Mr. Ibrahim has clashed publicly with his boss in recent weeks over how Malaysia should respond to the economic downturn. Although Mr. Ibrahim says he is loyal to Mr. Mahathir, political experts in Malaysia believe Mr. Ibrahim might challenge him if he felt he was being shunted out of power.
In Thailand and Korea, the Governments are struggling to impose harsh economic reforms mandated by the International Monetary Fund in the face of mounting opposition from labor leaders and populist politicians.

HEADLINE: Democratic Mayor's Support of Governor's Rival Muddles Alabama Race

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala., June 26

 BODY:
As if Alabama's Republican gubernatorial race has not been odd enough, the campaign between Gov. Fob James Jr. and Winton Blount 3d has been dominated in its final week by the possibility that it may be decided by Democrats.
On Tuesday night, one week before the June 30 runoff, Mayor Richard Arrington Jr. of Birmingham, a Democrat who has been elected five times, announced that his powerful get-out-the-vote machine was supporting Mr. Blount. Although Tuesday's contest is a runoff for the Republican nomination, it is open to voters regardless of party. 
 The endorsement by Mayor Arrington, who is black, has added a racial element to a campaign that has already encountered questions about body shape, inherited wealth and a deadly car wreck, along with the customary accusations of lying and underhandedness. Polls show that the race is close, and the prospect for crossover voting has made it utterly unpredictable.
Because Mr. James, 63, is a defiant defender of religious expression in schools and other public places, the election is considered a critical test of the voting strength of Christian conservatives.
The Governor took a break from campaigning on Wednesday to fly to Dallas, at state expense, to address an institute for Christian missionaries. On Thursday night, in the last of four televised debates, Mr. James asserted that "this country at one time was a Christian nation" because Americans recognized that the Constitution was founded on Judeo-Christian principles. A recent James television advertisement features a tribute by the wife of a judge who displays a tablet of the Ten Commandments in his courtroom and who has been defended by Mr. James.
Mr. Blount, 54, has stressed that he, too, supports returning prayer to the schools. But he maintains that Governor James has embarrassed the state by threatening to defy Supreme Court rulings on the question.
Republicans have grown concerned over the campaign's negative tone, worrying that the obvious beneficiary will be the Democratic nominee, Lieut. Gov. Don Siegelman. When Mr. Blount was slapping backs at a seniors center in Huntsville on Thursday, Robert L. Thibeault, a 65-year-old retired engineer, asked the candidate, "Why are you fellows cutting one another?"
Mr. Blount, a wealthy Montgomery businessman and longtime party loyalist, quickly blamed Mr. James. But the attacks continued in the Thursday night debate, which ended with a tit-for-tat about which candidate was the most deceitful.
In explaining the unprecedented endorsement by his Jefferson County Citizens Coalition, Mr. Arrington said the group was still likely to support Mr. Siegelman in the general election on Nov. 3. But the Mayor said he wanted to influence the Republican nomination because he had not been pleased with Mr. James's treatment of his city and that he hoped to provide Birmingham voters with "the best of both worlds."
The Citizens Coalition has set a goal of turning out 40,000 of Jefferson County's 360,000 registered voters, of whom 115,000 are black. Only 25,000 votes separated Mr. James and Mr. Blount in the five-candidate primary on June 2, when Mr. James finished with 48 percent of the vote to Mr. Blount's 41 percent.
Many politicians and strategists question whether it will be possible to turn out 40,000 voters. But the Citizens Coalition seems to be planning a full blitz, complete with radio advertising, mass mailings and bullhorn canvassing. Most of the costs will be paid by Mr. Blount's campaign, which is largely self-financed.
Financial disclosure reports filed on Thursday show that Mr. Blount has outspent Mr. James by $5.4 million to $2.5 million during the campaign. Some $3.7 million of Mr. Blount's money came from loans from himself or his family members.
Mr. James's campaign clearly takes the threat of crossover voting seriously. "If it were a traditional Republican primary, I think Governor James would win handily," said State Senator Bill Armistead, a James supporter. "But when you add in the Democrats' coming in to vote in our primary, it's in question."
Ralph Reed, Mr. James's campaign consultant, said Mr. Arrington might be the key to the election. "If he turns out 30,000, Blount might win," Mr. Reed said.
After unsuccessfully pursuing the Mayor's support, Mr. James's campaign now hopes that the endorsement of Mr. Blount will generate a backlash that energizes its own supporters. Mr. Reed contends that Mr. Blount must have cut a deal with the "liberal Democratic boss" involving promises of appointments and road financing, a charge denied by both Mr. Blount and Mr. Arrington.
Almost immediately after the endorsement was announced, some 300,000 fliers raising questions about such a deal were mailed across the state. The fliers feature a two-decade-old photograph of Donald V. Watkins, a political aide to the Mayor, who is shown with an Afro haircut that has long been shorn.
Mr. Blount said the fliers were "trying to use race to inflame the voters of Alabama." The author of the fliers, Joe Dickson, a black Republican newspaper publisher and a James ally, said the photograph of Mr. Watkins was the only one he could find in his files.
Both Mr. Dickson and Mr. James said the Governor had had no advance knowledge of the fliers. Mr. Dickson says he did not pay all of the $135,000 cost himself but has refused to say who paid the rest.
Throughout the campaign, Mr. James has pledged not to increase state taxes. Mr. Blount, while refusing to take such a pledge, has said he will eliminate the state's 4 percent sales tax on food within seven years, for tax cuts totaling $260 million. He has not specified how he would make up for the loss of revenue, other than through economic growth.
Much of the sniping has had little to do with policy. Mr. James has said that Mr. Blount is fat. A pair of James television advertisements suggest that Mr. Blount, who owns automobile dealerships and a plastics company, was a failure when he worked previously for his father's manufacturing company. His father, Winton M. Blount, called the charge a "terrible damn lie."
In another ad, a female narrator taunts, "Everybody knows that Daddy had to loan you the money to run."
Mr. Blount has also been forced to address a 1969 car accident in which he was driving a Jaguar at an estimated 90 miles an hour and struck another car. His first wife was killed in the crash. A police report said Mr. Blount, who was returning from a party, was "obviously drunk." He was charged with misdemeanor manslaughter, but the charge was later dropped.
Mr. James has not raised the accident as an issue, but Mr. Blount blames the Governor's campaign for an anonymous smear sheet that was mailed to reporters. "I don't think the people of Alabama will see it as an issue," Mr. Blount said. "I made a mistake, and I pay for it every day."

Stocks Finish Strong Week As S.& P. 500 Hits Record
The stock market rallied to close a week of solid gains, despite resilient fears about the year-old economic crisis in Asia and its eventual impact on corporate profits in this country. Investors bid many blue-chip issues into record territory.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.92 points, to a record 1,133.20, giving it a 3 percent gain for the week and nearly a 16.8 percent gain for the year. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.96 points for the day and 231.67 points for the week, or 2.7 percent, to close at 8,944.54. The average is 3 percent below its record high of May 13.

Clearer Sexual Harassment Law
The Supreme Court clarified the law on workplace sexual harassment, making some lawsuits against employers easier to win while limiting the legal exposure of companies that have effective anti-harassment policies. The rulings were praised by management and civil rights groups for bringing coherence to the law and providing incentives for preventing harassment and dealing with problems. A1.

China Trip Avoids Business
So far during his trip to China, President Clinton has played down commercial links between the two countries. The President's focus on diplomatic strategy, culture and tourism instead of commerce is a sign that business ties have in some ways outgrown the contract-by-contract nurturing of the 1980's and early 1990's. Indeed, investing in China has gone from adventurous to ordinary. A7.
 
China gave the United States its strongest assurances yet that it does not plan to devalue its currency, the yuan. The Clinton Administration fears that a devaluation by Beijing could spark a wave of devaluations across Asia. A7.
 
Karl Marx, Market Visionary
The globalization of national economies? Periodic crises like Asia's financial turmoil? Long before any Wall Street pundit, Karl Marx foresaw how the wealth-creating power of capitalism would conquer the world. (Of course, he would not have been particularly pleased with that outcome.) Still, on the 150th anniversary of The Communist Manifesto, readers on the political left and right have marveled at how Marx's description of capitalism resembles the restless, anxious and competitive world of today's global economy.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Plans Budget Cuts To Offset Council Spending

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

 BODY:
Despite others' projections of a hefty budget surplus next year, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he planned $427 million in cuts to counteract what he called overspending by the City Council.
Administration officials asserted that the cuts, from a budget of $34 billion, would be felt by few New Yorkers. The officials said some of the savings would be realized through efficiencies that would barely be noticed -- for instance, by reducing overtime payments. But in other cases, the officials acknowledged, the cuts are likely to come from the Council's additions to the Mayor's proposed budget. 
 Mr. Giuliani has denounced many of these additions, made at the behest of individual members, as shameless pork. The new budget year begins on Wednesday.
Mr. Giuliani made the announcement at the annual meeting of the State Financial Control Board, which has overseen the city's financial management since the fiscal crisis of 1975. Although most of the day's reports were accounts that the city was financially flush, Mr. Giuliani said his $427 million in spending reductions would protect the city even if the current boom fades.
"The biggest mistakes the city has made in the past, in the 70's and in the 80's, were at times when the economy was booming," Mr. Giuliani said. "It was in those times that rather than seriously restraining the urge to spend every penny, the city outspent the growth of its economy."
Joseph J. Lhota, the Mayor's Budget Director, said memos would be sent next week to the heads of city agencies, asking them to propose cuts that would meet a chosen target. Mr. Giuliani will review the proposed reductions, Mr. Lhota said.
Mr. Giuliani had been keeping the Council in suspense about how he would curb spending ever since the Council overrode his vetoes of some items in the 1998-99 budget, which the Council passed without his agreement on June 5.
Although the Council passes the budget, it is the Mayor who spends the money, and even if his vetoes are overridden he can still order spending cuts. At first he threatened to refuse to spend money allocated in the budget, which would probably have resulted in a court fight with the Council. But his aides said the cuts would make that unnecessary.
Peter F. Vallone, the Council Speaker, said in a statement that the Council would fight any budget cuts that "end up hurting valuable services and people."
"The Mayor's math just doesn't add up," Mr. Vallone said. "We have a $2 billion surplus, but he still wants to cut agency spending."
Mr. Giuliani has sparred with the Financial Control Board in the past, but yesterday's meeting was all mutual congratulations. The board's chairman is Gov. George E. Pataki, who opened the meeting but then departed unexpectedly, without explanation to the Mayor, before Mr. Giuliani began speaking. First, though, Mr. Pataki praised Mr. Giuliani for the city's balanced budgets and record surpluses. The men, both Republicans, have had a frosty relationship that has seemed to warm up in recent months.
"Mr. Mayor, I think we should all be very, very proud and grateful for the record of accomplishment over the course of the last five years," the Governor said.
Two Democrats on the Financial Control Board, Alan G. Hevesi and H. Carl McCall, also had praise for Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Hevesi, the City Comptroller, said the city should finish this budget year with a surplus of about $2.2 billion, and should have a surplus next year of $576 million to $806 million.
Mr. McCall, the State Comptroller, said he expected the city to end this budget year with a surplus of $2.1 billion and have "a significant surplus" next year. But he warned that the budget discord "threatens to distract the city from making headway on pressing long-term budget issues."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Moves to Assume Daily Operation of Camden

 BODY:
In an unprecedented intervention into local affairs, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has proposed that New Jersey officials take control of virtually all of Camden's financial dealings.
The proposal, included in the pending $18 billion state budget approved by Senate and Assembly committees on Thursday, would establish a seven-member financial review board appointed by the Governor with sweeping powers over Camden's budget, labor contracts and borrowing plans. If approved by the full Legislature on Monday, the proposal could eventually give the board daily control of Camden's spending. The proposal would allow the city to retain control of its welfare department, which state officials had tried to hand over to the county. 
 With an unemployment rate of nearly 14 percent, almost triple the state average, and a per-capita income of $7,276, the lowest in the state, Camden is in dire need of a financial recovery plan, officials say. During the last four years, the state has given almost $50 million in aid to Camden, more than half of the city's total budget in that period, and the Whitman administration has moved to seize control of the city's finances to insure that this level of support does not continue to be necessary, said Jane Kenny, Commissioner of the State Department of Community Affairs.
While Ms. Kenny said that the state had never before tried to delve so deeply into municipal finances, she balked at the notion that Camden, a city of 85,000, would effectively become state-run.
"Even if we have far-reaching power," she said, "we intend to work with Camden."
While city officials said they would welcome advice from the state, they contended that the Governor's proposal seeks too much control.
"We don't want our city government to be under the thumb of any outside entity," said Keith A. Walker, assistant business administrator for the city. "We don't need a stern father figure looking over our shoulder. We need a compassionate brother or sister."
Mr. Walker said the city and state had initially discussed the creation of a "financial recovery team" composed of visiting state officials, who would bring their expertise and talents to Camden to guide the city to fiscal solvency. But Mr. Walker said the proposal was discarded in favor of the more stringent review board after much discussion.
Camden is no stranger to intervention from outside governmental bodies. Last summer, the Federal Government seized control of the city's housing authority, claiming that scores of public-housing residents lived in deplorable conditions. In 1996, Governor Whitman sent a detachment of state troopers to Camden to help the Police Department patrol the streets after a rash of murders.
But some officials in Camden called the proposed review board excessive. It would deprive residents of their right to elect their own representatives, said State Senator Wayne R. Bryant, a Democrat who unsuccessfully fought the Governor's plan in Thursday's voting session. By placing Camden's crippled economy in the hands of outsiders who have yet to come up with a clear recovery plan, the proposal would also perpetuate the city's economic woes, he said.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT;
Excerpts From Decisions on Law on Sexual Harassment in Workplace

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from today's Supreme Court decisions in two sexual harassment cases, Burlington Industries v. Ellerth and Faragher v. City of Boca Raton. The opinion in the Burlington case was written by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and that in the Boca Raton was by Justice David H. Souter. Joining them in the majorities were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sandra Day O'Connor and John Paul Stevens. Dissenting opinions, which are also excerpted, were filed by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
 
FROM THE DECISION IN THE BURLINGTON CASE
By Justice Kennedy
We decide whether, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, an employee who refuses the unwelcome and threatening sexual advances of a supervisor, yet suffers no adverse, tangible job consequences, can recover against the employer without showing the employer is negligent or otherwise at fault for the supervisor's actions. 
 Summary judgment was granted for the employer, so we must take the facts alleged by the employee to be true. The employer is Burlington Industries, the petitioner. The employee is Kimberly Ellerth, the respondent. From March 1993 until May 1994, Ellerth worked as a salesperson in one of Burlington's divisions in Chicago, Ill. During her employment, she alleges, she was subjected to constant sexual harassment by her supervisor, one Ted Slowik.
In the hierarchy of Burlington's management structure, Slowik was a mid-level manager. Burlington has eight divisions, employing more than 22,000 people in some 50 plants around the United States. Slowik was a vice president in one of five business units within one of the divisions. He had authority to make hiring and promotion decisions subject to the approval of his supervisor, who signed the paperwork. According to Slowik's supervisor, his position was "not considered an upper-level management position," and he was "not amongst the decision-making or policy-making hierarchy."
Slowik was not Ellerth's immediate supervisor. Ellerth worked in a two-person office in Chicago, and she answered to her office colleague, who in turn answered to Slowik in New York.
Against a background of repeated boorish and offensive remarks and gestures which Slowik allegedly made, Ellerth places particular emphasis on three alleged incidents where Slowik's comments could be construed as threats to deny her tangible job benefits.
In the summer of 1993, while on a business trip, Slowik invited Ellerth to the hotel lounge, an invitation Ellerth felt compelled to accept because Slowik was her boss. When Ellerth gave no encouragement to remarks Slowik made about her breasts, he told her to "loosen up" and warned, " y ou know, Kim, I could make your life very hard or very easy at Burlington."
In March 1994, when Ellerth was being considered for a promotion, Slowik expressed reservations during the promotion interview because she was not "loose enough." The comment was followed by his reaching over and rubbing her knee.
Ellerth did receive the promotion; but when Slowik called to announce it, he told Ellerth, "You're gonna be out there with men who work in factories, and they certainly like women with pretty butts/legs."
In May 1994, Ellerth called Slowik, asking permission to insert a customer's logo into a fabric sample. Slowik responded, "I don't have time for you right now, Kim, unless you want to tell me what you're wearing." Ellerth told Slowik she had to go and ended the call.
A day or two later, Ellerth called Slowik to ask permission again. This time he denied her request, but added something along the lines of "Are you wearing shorter skirts yet, Kim, because it would make your job a whole heck of a lot easier."
A short time later, Ellerth's immediate supervisor cautioned her about returning telephone calls to customers in a prompt fashion. In response, Ellerth quit. She faxed a letter giving reasons unrelated to the alleged sexual harassment we have described.
About three weeks later, however, she sent a letter explaining she quit because of Slowik's behavior.
During her tenure at Burlington, Ellerth did not inform anyone in authority about Slowik's conduct, despite knowing Burlington had a policy against sexual harassment. In fact, she chose not to inform her immediate supervisor because " 'it would be his duty as my supervisor to report any incidents of sexual harassment.' " On one occasion, she told Slowik a comment he made was inappropriate.
In October 1994, after receiving a right-to-sue letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (E.E.O.C.), Ellerth filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging Burlington engaged in sexual harassment and forced her constructive discharge, in violation of Title VII.
The district court granted summary judgment to Burlington. The court found Slowik's behavior, as described by Ellerth, severe and pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment, but found Burlington neither knew nor should have known about the conduct. There was no triable issue of fact on the latter point, and the Court noted Ellerth had not used Burlington's internal complaint procedures.
Although Ellerth's claim was framed as a hostile work environment complaint, the district court observed there was a quid pro quo "component" to the hostile environment. Proceeding from the premise that an employer faces vicarious liability for quid pro quo harassment, the district court thought it necessary to apply a negligence standard because the quid pro quo merely contributed to the hostile work environment.
The court of appeals en banc reversed in a decision which produced eight separate opinions and no consensus for a controlling rationale. The judges were able to agree on the problem they confronted: Vicarious liability, not failure to comply with a duty of care, was the essence of Ellerth's case against Burlington on appeal. . . .
We must decide, then, whether an employer has vicarious liability when a supervisor creates a hostile work environment by making explicit threats to alter a subordinate's terms or conditions of employment, based on sex, but does not fulfill the threat. We turn to principles of agency law, for the term "employer" is defined under Title VII to include "agents."
In express terms, Congress has directed Federal courts to interpret Title VII based on agency principles. Given such an explicit instruction, we conclude a uniform and predictable standard must be established as a matter of Federal law. We rely "on the general common law of agency, rather than on the law of any particular State, to give meaning to these terms." The resulting Federal rule, based on a body of case law developed over time, is statutory interpretation pursuant to Congressional direction. This is not Federal common law in "the strictest sense, i.e., a rule of decision that amounts, not simply to an interpretation of a Federal statute . . . , but, rather, to the judicial 'creation' of a special Federal rule of decision."
As Meritor acknowledged, the Restatement (Second) of Agency (1957) (hereinafter Restatement), is a useful beginning point for a discussion of general agency principles. Since our decision in Meritor, Federal courts have explored agency principles, and we find useful instruction in their decisions, noting that "common-law principles may not be transferable in all their particulars to Title VII." The E.E.O.C. has issued guidelines governing sexual harassment claims under Title VII, but they provide little guidance on the issue of employer liability for supervisor harassment.
Section 219(1) of the Restatement sets out a central principle of agency law:
"A master is subject to liability for the torts of his servants committed while acting in the scope of their employment."
An employer may be liable for both negligent and intentional torts committed by an employee within the scope of his or her employment. Sexual harassment under Title VII presupposes intentional conduct. While early decisions absolved employers of liability for the intentional torts of their employees, the law now imposes liability where the employee's "purpose, however misguided, is wholly or in part to further the master's business." In applying scope of employment principles to intentional torts, however, it is accepted that "it is less likely that a willful tort will properly be held to be in the course of employment and that the liability of the master for such torts will naturally be more limited." . . .
At the outset, we can identify a class of cases where, beyond question, more than the mere existence of the employment relation aids in commission of the harassment: when a supervisor takes a tangible employment action against the subordinate. Every Federal court of appeals to have considered the question has found vicarious liability when a discriminatory act results in a tangible employment action. . . .
In the context of this case, a tangible employment action would have taken the form of a denial of a raise or a promotion. The concept of a tangible employment action appears in numerous cases in the courts of appeals discussing claims involving race, age, and national origin discrimination, as well as sex discrimination.
Without endorsing the specific results of those decisions, we think it prudent to import the concept of a tangible employment action for resolution of the vicarious liability issue we consider here.
A tangible employment action constitutes a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.
When a supervisor makes a tangible employment decision, there is assurance the injury could not have been inflicted absent the agency relation. A tangible employment action in most cases inflicts direct economic harm. As a general proposition, only a supervisor, or other person acting with the authority of the company, can cause this sort of injury. A co-worker can break a co-worker's arm as easily as a supervisor, and anyone who has regular contact with an employee can inflict psychological injuries by his or her offensive conduct. But one co-worker (absent some elaborate scheme) cannot dock another's pay, nor can one co-worker demote another.
Tangible employment actions fall within the special province of the supervisor. The supervisor has been empowered by the company as a distinct class of agent to make economic decisions affecting other employees under his or her control.
Tangible employment actions are the means by which the supervisor brings the official power of the enterprise to bear on subordinates. A tangible employment decision requires an official act of the enterprise, a company act. The decision in most cases is documented in official company records, and may be subject to review by higher level supervisors. The supervisor often must obtain the imprimatur of the enterprise and use its internal processes.
For these reasons, a tangible employment action taken by the supervisor becomes for Title VII purposes the act of the employer. Whatever the exact contours of the aided in the agency relation standard, its requirements will always be met when a supervisor takes a tangible employment action against a subordinate. In that instance, it would be implausible to interpret agency principles to allow an employer to escape liability, as Meritor itself appeared to acknowledge.
Whether the agency relation aids in commission of supervisor harassment which does not culminate in a tangible employment action is less obvious. Application of the standard is made difficult by its malleable terminology, which can be read to either expand or limit liability in the context of supervisor harassment.
On the one hand, a supervisor's power and authority invests his or her harassing conduct with a particular threatening character, and in this sense, a supervisor always is aided by the agency relation. On the other hand, there are acts of harassment a supervisor might commit which might be the same acts a co-employee would commit, and there may be some circumstances where the supervisor's status makes little difference.
It is this tension which, we think, has caused so much confusion among the courts of appeals which have sought to apply the aided in the agency relation standard to Title VII cases. The aided in the agency relation standard, however, is a developing feature of agency law, and we hesitate to render a definitive explanation of our understanding of the standard in an area where other important considerations must affect our judgment. In particular, we are bound by our holding in Meritor that agency principles constrain the imposition of vicarious liability in cases of supervisory harassment. . . .
In order to accommodate the agency principles of vicarious liability for harm caused by misuse of supervisory authority, as well as Title VII's equally basic policies of encouraging forethought by employers and saving action by objecting employees, we adopt the following holding in this case and in Faragher v. Boca Raton, also decided today.
An employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee. When no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence.
The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.
While proof that an employer had promulgated an anti-harassment policy with complaint procedure is not necessary in every instance as a matter of law, the need for a stated policy suitable to the employment circumstances may appropriately be addressed in any case when litigating the first element of the defense. And while proof that an employee failed to fulfill the corresponding obligation of reasonable care to avoid harm is not limited to showing any unreasonable failure to use any complaint procedure provided by the employer, a demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to satisfy the employer's burden under the second element of the defense. No affirmative defense is available, however, when the supervisor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion or undesirable reassignment.
Although Ellerth has not alleged she suffered a tangible employment action at the hands of Slowik, which would deprive Burlington of the availability of the affirmative defense, this is not dispositive. In light of our decision, Burlington is still subject to vicarious liability for Slowik's activity, but Burlington should have an opportunity to assert and prove the affirmative defense to liability.
For these reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the court of appeals, reversing the grant of summary judgment against Ellerth. On remand, the district court will have the opportunity to decide whether it would be appropriate to allow Ellerth to amend her pleading or supplement her discovery.
 
FROM THE DISSENT
By Justice Thomas
The Court today manufactures a rule that employers are vicariously liable if supervisors create a sexually hostile work environment, subject to an affirmative defense that the Court barely attempts to define. This rule applies even if the employer has a policy against sexual harassment, the employee knows about that policy, and the employee never informs anyone in a position of authority about the supervisor's conduct.
As a result, employer liability under Title VII is judged by different standards depending upon whether a sexually or racially hostile work environment is alleged. The standard of employer liability should be the same in both instances: An employer should be liable if, and only if, the plaintiff proves that the employer was negligent in permitting the supervisor's conduct to occur.
Years before sexual harassment was recognized as "discriminat ion because of sex," the courts of appeals considered whether, and when, a racially hostile work environment could violate Title VII. In the landmark case Rogers v. E.E.O.C., the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the practice of racially segregating patients in a doctor's office could amount to discrimination in " 'the terms, conditions, or privileges' " of employment, thereby violating Title VII. The principal opinion in the case concluded that employment discrimination was not limited to the "isolated and distinguishable events" of "hiring, firing, and promoting." Rather, Title VII could also be violated by a work environment "heavily polluted with discrimination," because of the deleterious effects of such an atmosphere on an employee's well-being.
Accordingly, after Rogers, a plaintiff claiming employment discrimination based upon race could assert a claim for a racially hostile work environment, in addition to the classic claim of so-called "disparate treatment." A disparate treatment claim required a plaintiff to prove an adverse employment consequence and discriminatory intent by his employer. A hostile environment claim required the plaintiff to show that his work environment was so pervaded by racial harassment as to alter the terms and conditions of his employment. This is the same standard now used when determining whether sexual harassment renders a work environment hostile. . . .
If a supervisor creates a hostile work environment, however, he does not act for the employer. As the Court concedes, a supervisor's creation of a hostile work environment is neither within the scope of his employment, nor part of his apparent authority. Indeed, a hostile work environment is antithetical to the interest of the employer. In such circumstances, an employer should be liable only if it has been negligent. That is, liability should attach only if the employer either knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, about the hostile work environment and failed to take remedial action.
Sexual harassment is simply not something that employers can wholly prevent without taking extraordinary measures -- constant video and audio surveillance, for example -- that would revolutionize the workplace in a manner incompatible with a free society.
Indeed, such measures could not even detect incidents of harassment such as the comments Slowick allegedly made to respondent in a hotel bar. The most that employers can be charged with, therefore, is a duty to act reasonably under the circumstances. As one court recognized in addressing an early racial harassment claim:
"It may not always be within an employer's power to guarantee an environment free from all bigotry. . . . H e can let it be known, however, that racial harassment will not be tolerated, and he can take all reasonable measures to enforce this policy. . . . But once an employer has in good faith taken those measures which are both feasible and reasonable under the circumstances to combat the offensive conduct we do not think he can be charged with discriminating on the basis of race."
Under a negligence standard, Burlington cannot be held liable for Slowick's conduct. Although respondent alleged a hostile work environment, she never contended that Burlington had been negligent in permitting the harassment to occur, and there is no question that Burlington acted reasonably under the circumstances. The company had a policy against sexual harassment, and respondent admitted that she was aware of the policy but nonetheless failed to tell anyone with authority over Slowick about his behavior.
Burlington therefore cannot be charged with knowledge of Slowick's alleged harassment or with a failure to exercise reasonable care in not knowing about it.
Rejecting a negligence standard, the Court instead imposes a rule of vicarious employer liability, subject to a vague affirmative defense, for the acts of supervisors who wield no delegated authority in creating a hostile work environment. This rule is a whole-cloth creation that draws no support from the legal principles on which the Court claims it is based. Compounding its error, the Court fails to explain how employers can rely upon the affirmative defense, thus ensuring a continuing reign of confusion in this important area of the law. . . .
Thus although the Court implies that it has found guidance in both precedent and statute -- its holding is a product of willful policy making, pure and simple. The only agency principle that justifies imposing employer liability in this context is the principle that a master will be liable for a servant's torts if the master was negligent or reckless in permitting them to occur; and as noted, under a negligence standard, Burlington cannot be held liable.
The Court's decision is also in considerable tension with our holding in Meritor that employers are not strictly liable for a supervisor's sexual harassment. Although the Court recognizes an affirmative defense -- based solely on its divination of Title VII's gestalt -- it provides shockingly little guidance about how employers can actually avoid vicarious liability. . . .
Popular misconceptions notwithstanding, sexual harassment is not a freestanding Federal tort, but a form of employment discrimination. As such, it should be treated no differently (and certainly no better) than the other forms of harassment that are illegal under Title VII. I would restore parallel treatment of employer liability for racial and sexual harassment and hold an employer liable for a hostile work environment only if the employer is truly at fault. I therefore respectfully dissent.
 
FROM THE DECISION
IN THE BOCA RATON CASE
By Justice Souter
This case calls for identification of the circumstances under which an employer may be held liable under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for the acts of a supervisory employee whose sexual harassment of subordinates has created a hostile work environment amounting to employment discrimination. We hold that an employer is vicariously liable for actionable discrimination caused by a supervisor, but subject to an affirmative defense looking to the reasonableness of the employer's conduct as well as that of a plaintiff victim.
Between 1985 and 1990, while attending college, petitioner Beth Ann Faragher worked part time and during the summers as an ocean lifeguard for the marine safety section of the Parks and Recreation Department of respondent, the City of Boca Raton, Fla. During this period, Faragher's immediate supervisors were Bill Terry, David Silverman and Robert Gordon. In June 1990, Faragher resigned.
In 1992, Faragher brought an action against Terry, Silverman and the city, asserting claims under Title VII. So far as it concerns the Title VII claim, the complaint alleged that Terry and Silverman created a "sexually hostile atmosphere" at the beach by repeatedly subjecting Faragher and other female lifeguards to "uninvited and offensive touching," by making lewd remarks, and by speaking of women in offensive terms. The complaint contained specific allegations that Terry once said that he would never promote a woman to the rank of lieutenant, and that Silverman had said to Faragher, 'Date me or clean the toilets for a year.' Asserting that Terry and Silverman were agents of the city, and that their conduct amounted to discrimination in the "terms, conditions, and privileges" of her employment, Faragher sought a judgment against the city for nominal damages, costs, and attorney's fees. . . .
In February 1986, the city adopted a sexual harassment policy, which it stated in a memorandum from the city manager addressed to all employees. In May 1990, the city revised the policy and reissued a statement of it. Although the city may actually have circulated the memos and statements to some employees, it completely failed to disseminate its policy among employees of the marine safety section, with the result that Terry, Silverman, Gordon and many lifeguards were unaware of it.
From time to time over the course of Faragher's tenure at the marine safety section, between 4 and 6 of the 40 to 50 lifeguards were women. During that 5-year period, Terry repeatedly touched the bodies of female employees without invitation would put his arm around Faragher, with his hand on her buttocks, and once made contact with another female lifeguard in a motion of sexual simulation. He made crudely demeaning references to women generally, and once commented disparagingly on Faragher's shape. During a job interview with a woman he hired as a lifeguard, Terry said that the female lifeguards had sex with their male counterparts and asked whether she would do the same.
Silverman behaved in similar ways. He once tackled Faragher and remarked that, but for a physical characteristic he found unattractive, he would readily have had sexual relations with her. Another time, he pantomimed an act of oral sex. Within earshot of the female lifeguards, Silverman made frequent, vulgar references to women and sexual matters, commented on the bodies of female lifeguards and beachgoers, and at least twice told female lifeguards that he would like to engage in sex with them. . . .
Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, " i t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." We have repeatedly made clear that although the statute mentions specific employment decisions with immediate consequences, the scope of the prohibition "is not limited to economic or tangible discrimination," and that it covers more than "terms" and "conditions" in the narrow contractual sense. Thus, in Meritor we held that sexual harassment so "severe or pervasive" as to "alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment" violates Title VII.
In thus holding that environmental claims are covered by the statute, we drew upon earlier cases recognizing liability for discriminatory harassment based on race and national origin, just as we have also followed the lead of such cases in attempting to define the severity of the offensive conditions necessary to constitute actionable sex discrimination under the statute.
So, in Harris, we explained that in order to be actionable under the statute, a sexually objectionable environment must be both objectively and subjectively offensive, one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive, and one that the victim in fact did perceive to be so.We directed courts to determine whether an environment is sufficiently hostile or abusive by "looking at all the circumstances," including the "frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance." Most recently, we explained that Title VII does not prohibit "genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and women routinely interact with members of the same sex and of the opposite sex." A recurring point in these opinions is that "simple teasing," offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the "terms and conditions of employment."
These standards for judging hostility are sufficiently demanding to insure that Title VII does not become a "general civility code." Properly applied, they will filter out complaints attacking "the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing." We have made it clear that conduct must be extreme to amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment, and the courts of appeals have heeded this view.
While indicating the substantive contours of the hostile environments forbidden by Title VII, our cases have established few definite rules for determining when an employer will be liable for a discriminatory environment that is otherwise actionably abusive. Given the circumstances of many of the litigated cases, including some that have come to us, it is not surprising that in many of them, the issue has been joined over the sufficiency of the abusive conditions, not the standards for determining an employer's liability for them. There have, for example, been myriad cases in which district courts and courts of appeals have held employers liable on account of actual knowledge by the employer, or high-echelon officials of an employer organization, of sufficiently harassing action by subordinates, which the employer or its informed officers have done nothing to stop. In such instances, the combined knowledge and inaction may be seen as demonstrable negligence, or as the employer's adoption of the offending conduct and its results, quite as if they had been authorized affirmatively as the employer's policy. . . .
Finally, there is nothing remarkable in the fact that claims against employers for discriminatory employment actions with tangible results, like hiring, firing, promotion, compensation, and work assignment, have resulted in employer liability once the discrimination was shown. A variety of reasons have been invoked for this apparently unanimous rule. Some courts explain, in a variation of the "proxy" theory discussed above, that when a supervisor makes such decisions, he "merges" with the employer, and his act becomes that of the employer. . . .
Faragher points to several ways in which the agency relationship aided Terry and Silverman in carrying out their harassment. She argues that, in general, offending supervisors can abuse their authority to keep subordinates in their presence while they make offensive statements, and that they implicitly threaten to misuse their supervisory powers to deter any resistance or complaint. Thus, she maintains that power conferred on Terry and Silverman by the city enabled them to act for so long without provoking defiance or complaint.
The city, however, contends that 219(2)(d) has no application here. It argues that the second qualification of the subsection, referring to a servant "aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation," merely "refines" the one preceding it, which holds the employer vicariously liable for its servant's abuse of apparent authority. But this narrow reading is untenable; it would render the second qualification of 219(2)(d) almost entirely superfluous (and would seem to ask us to shut our eyes to the potential effects of supervisory authority, even when not explicitly invoked). The illustrations accompanying this subsection make clear that it covers not only cases involving the abuse of apparent authority, but also to cases in which tortious conduct is made possible or facilitated by the existence of the actual agency relationship. See Restatement 219 Comment e (noting employer liability where "the servant may be able to cause harm because of his position as agent, as where a telegraph operator sends false messages purporting to come from third persons" and where the manager who operates a store "for an undisclosed principal is enabled to cheat the customers because of his position"); 247, Illustration 1 (noting a newspaper's liability for a libelous editorial published by an editor acting for his own purposes).
We therefore agree with Faragher that in implementing Title VII, it makes sense to hold an employer vicariously liable for some tortious conduct of a supervisor made possible by abuse of his supervisory authority, and that the aided-by-agency-relation principle embodied in 219(2)(d) of the Restatement provides an appropriate starting point for determining liability for the kind of harassment presented here. Several courts, indeed, have noted what Faragher has argued, that there is a sense in which a harassing supervisor is always assisted in his misconduct by the supervisory relationship. The agency relationship affords contact with an employee subjected to a supervisor's sexual harassment, and the victim may well be reluctant to accept the risks of blowing the whistle on a superior. When a person with supervisory authority discriminates in the terms and conditions of subordinates' employment, his actions necessarily draw upon his superior position over the people who report to him, or those under them, whereas an employee generally cannot check a supervisor's abusive conduct the same way that she might deal with abuse from a co-worker. When a fellow employee harasses, the victim can walk away or tell the offender where to go, but it may be difficult to offer such responses to a supervisor, whose "power to supervise -- which may be to hire and fire, and to set work schedules and pay rates -- does not disappear . . . when he chooses to harass through insults and offensive gestures rather than directly with threats of firing or promises of promotion." Recognition of employer liability when discriminatory misuse of supervisory authority alters the terms and conditions of a victim's employment is underscored by the fact that the employer has a greater opportunity to guard against misconduct by supervisors than by common workers; employers have greater opportunity and incentive to screen them, train them, and monitor their performance. . . .
There is certainly some authority for requiring active or affirmative, as distinct from passive or implicit, misuse of supervisory authority before liability may be imputed. That is the way some courts have viewed the familiar cases holding the employer liable for discriminatory employment action with tangible consequences, like firing and demotion. . . .
If the plaintiff unreasonably failed to avail herself of the employer's preventive or remedial apparatus, she should not recover damages that could have been avoided if she had done so. If the victim could have avoided harm, no liability should be found against the employer who had taken reasonable care, and if damages could reasonably have been mitigated, no award against a liable employer should reward a plaintiff for what her own efforts could have avoided.
In order to accommodate the principle of vicarious liability for harm caused by misuse of supervisory authority, as well as Title VII's equally basic policies of encouraging forethought by employers and saving action by objecting employees, we adopt the following holding in this case and in Burlington Industries Inc. v. Ellerth, also decided today. An employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee. When no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence. The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. While proof that an employer had promulgated an antiharassment policy with complaint procedure is not necessary in every instance as a matter of law, the need for a stated policy suitable to the employment circumstances may appropriately be addressed in any case when litigating the first element of the defense. And while proof that an employee failed to fulfill the corresponding obligation of reasonable care to avoid harm is not limited to showing an unreasonable failure to use any complaint procedure provided by the employer, a demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to satisfy the employer's burden under the second element of the defense. No affirmative defense is available, however, when the supervisor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion or undesirable reassignment.
Applying these rules here, we believe that the judgment of the court of appeals must be reversed. The district court found that the degree of hostility in the work environment rose to the actionable level and was attributable to Silverman and Terry. It is undisputed that these supervisors "were granted virtually unchecked authority" over their subordinates, "directly controll ing and supervis ing all aspects of Faragher's day-to-day activities." It is also clear that Faragher and her colleagues were "completely isolated from the city's higher management." The city did not seek review of these findings.
While the city would have an opportunity to raise an affirmative defense if there were any serious prospect of its presenting one, it appears from the record that any such avenue is closed. The district court found that the city had entirely failed to disseminate its policy against sexual harassment among the beach employees and that its officials made no attempt to keep track of the conduct of supervisors like Terry and Silverman. The record also makes clear that the city's policy did not include any assurance that the harassing supervisors could be bypassed in registering complaints. Under such circumstances, we hold as a matter of law that the city could not be found to have exercised reasonable care to prevent the supervisors' harassing conduct. Unlike the employer of a small workforce, who might expect that sufficient care to prevent tortious behavior could be exercised informally, those responsible for city operations could not reasonably have thought that precautions against hostile environments in any one of many departments in far-flung locations could be effective without communicating some formal policy against harassment, with a sensible complaint procedure.
We have drawn this conclusion without overlooking two possible grounds upon which the City might argue for the opportunity to litigate further. There is, first, the court of appeals's indulgent gloss on the relevant evidence: "There is some evidence that the city did not effectively disseminate among marine safety employees its sexual harassment policy." But, in contrast to the court of appeals's characterization, the district court made an explicit finding of a "complete failure on the part of the city to disseminate said policy among marine safety section employees." The evidence supports the district court's finding and there is no contrary claim before us.
The second possible ground for pursuing a defense was asserted by the city in its argument addressing the possibility of negligence liability in this case. It said that it should not be held liable for failing to promulgate an anti-harassment policy, because there was no apparent duty to do so in the 1985-1990 period. The city purports to rest this argument on the position of the E.E.O.C. during the period mentioned, but it turns out that the record on this point is quite against the city's position. Although the E.E.O.C issued regulations dealing with promulgating a statement of policy and providing a complaint mechanism in 1990, ever since 1980 its regulations have called for steps to prevent violations, such as informing employees of their rights and the means to assert them. The city, after all, adopted an anti-harassment policy in 1986.
The city points to nothing that might justify a conclusion by the district court on remand that the city had exercised reasonable care. Nor is there any reason to remand for consideration of Faragher's efforts to mitigate her own damages, since the award to her was solely nominal. . . .
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for reinstatement of the judgment of the district court.
 
FROM THE DISSENT
By Justice Thomas
For the reasons given in my dissenting opinion in Burlington Industries v. Ellerth, absent an adverse employment consequence, an employer cannot be held vicariously liable if a supervisor creates a hostile work environment. Petitioner suffered no adverse employment consequence; thus the court of appeals was correct to hold that the city is not vicariously liable for the conduct of Chief Terry and Lieutenant Silverman. Because the Court reverses this judgment, I dissent.
As for petitioner's negligence claim, the district court made no finding as to the city's negligence, and the court of appeals did not directly consider the issue. I would therefore remand the case to the district court for further proceedings on this question alone. I disagree with the court's conclusion that merely because the city did not disseminate its sexual harassment policy, it should be liable as a matter of law. The city should be allowed to show either that: (1) there was a reasonably available avenue through which petitioner could have complained to a city official who supervised both Chief Terry and Lieutenant Silverman, or (2) it would not have learned of the harassment even if the policy had been distributed. Petitioner, as the plaintiff, would of course bear the burden of proving the city's negligence.

To the Editor:
Re your June 25 news article on the awarding of credits and subsequent diplomas to students at a Brooklyn alternative high school for "questionable internships" and "specially designed courses": 
 As I tried to make clear to investigators from the office of Edward F. Stancik, the special investigator for the New York City public schools, the delivery of curriculum in education is a philosophical matter, not one of substance.
A course in "ornamental horticulture" involves more than the "creation of centerpieces." Well taught, it involves marketing, economics, communications, social sciences, botany and mathematics.
When "bicycle repair" is known to include the economics of small-business ownership, the geography of travel, the physics involved in motion and leverage, it becomes a hub for the teaching all varieties of traditional knowledge. A travel-agency internship involves economics, geography, business communications and the very job-readiness skills that leaders of American industry decry as lacking in most high school graduates.
That Marcia Brevot, the acting principal of the Senior Academy, whom I supervised, cannot be disciplined is not due to her being a consultant: she cannot be disciplined because the findings in Mr. Stancik's report do not warrant discipline.

To the Editor:
"Alarmists Overstate China Army Buildup" (letter, June 26) errs in suggesting that the threat of increased Chinese military spending is canceled out by the country's high inflation rate. China's 1998 state budget contains a nearly 13 percent rise in military expenditures, while the expected inflation rate for 1998 is under 3 percent. Moreover, most China analysts agree that the published defense budget is but a fraction of actual military expenditures. 
 This buildup occurs at a time when China faces serious economic, environmental and social problems. Millions of workers have been laid off; a painful restructuring effort is underway. And China faces no external enemy.
The Chinese leadership continues to define all its regional territorial disputes as strictly domestic matters. Its neighbors, including India, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam and Indonesia, disagree. China's behavior should not be dismissed as a "long-overdue upgrading of the military of the world's most populous state," nor should those who profess alarm at China's behavior be derided as "alarmist."

It now appears that voters will have little choice but to risk Republican Bible-based domestic policies rather than continue on the truly dangerous path of Democratic foreign policy.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Crisis in Banking Is Japanese, But Implications Are Global

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN and NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 26

 BODY:
When finance ministers and investment strategists have nightmares these days, they often involve huge financial institutions that are hardly household words in the West.
Yet if names like Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank or Ashikaga Bank trip on Western tongues, there is a growing apprehension that Japanese financial institutions like them may threaten the boom on Wall Street and even the stability of the global economy. 
 Japan's economy is in recession, its stock market is down 60 percent over eight years, and its currency has cascaded 43 percent from its high point in 1995. There is increasing consensus among Japanese politicians -- though not among economists -- that the problems center on a challenge that the Government is only beginning to confront: the mountain of bad debts at the nation's banks.
Now there is an emerging sense that the next few weeks may mark a turning point for the banking crisis -- and, indirectly, for the global economy to which it is connected.
"The situation in Japan is a source of very considerable concern," Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, said in Washington after his return this week from a trip to Japan in which he twisted Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's arm to get him to face up to the debt crisis. Mr. Summers added that this was a "pivotal moment for Asia and the global economy."
United States policy makers fear that Japan is a weak link in the international economy. Burdened by bad debts from a property market that has tumbled up to 90 percent, some of Japan's largest banks are in a tenuous position. Merger talks involving the Long-Term Credit Bank, one of the most troubled institutions, and the Sumitomo Trust and Banking Company, a stronger bank, were confirmed today. Mr. Hashimoto says the solution to the problem is what he describes as the "Total Plan." That is certainly a misnomer, for the plan is neither total in addressing the economy's problems, nor fully formed. It is instead a vague idea to peel bad loans off bank books and resell them in the marketplace -- much as the United States tackled the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980's by empowering the Resolution Trust Corporation to sell off bad assets from the institutions.
The centerpiece of the Total Plan would be the creation of a Government "bridge bank" that would take over the loan portfolios of failing banks, reselling good loans and writing off bad ones, with taxpayers absorbing the losses. The bridge bank would also look after customers of failing institutions, offering them a bridge to get by until they can establish a relationship with another bank.
Mr. Hashimoto has said that he will summon Parliament for a special session late next month to pass legislation on the plan. The question being asked by bankers, diplomats and businessmen increasingly is no longer whether Mr. Hashimoto will act. It is whether he will do enough, and whether the proposed cure will rescue the economy or cripple it with more Government intervention.
"The politicians are certainly starting to talk volubly about something having to be done even before the elections," said Minoru Makihara, the chairman of the Mitsubishi Corporation, referring to parliamentary elections on July 12. "That is something that they didn't talk about earlier."
L. William Seidman, former head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, has talked with Japanese politicians about the banking crisis. "I told them that there's no way they can do this harmoniously," he said. "It will involve some pain."
Japanese banks are dimly understood in the West, yet they are colossal -- the biggest bank in the world is Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, with $564 billion in total assets, compared with $364.7 billion for the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the biggest in the United States. In a few cases, the Japanese banks are tottering. It was the frailty of these vast institutions that led President Clinton and Mr. Hashimoto to order joint intervention in the currency markets last week to bolster the yen.
There is concern not simply about the collapse of any individual bank or the difficulties of its depositors, but also about the consequences for the entire economic structure. In an increasingly globalized economy, there is a possibility that bank runs could touch off a liquidity crisis that could race around the world in minutes, sending markets plunging and ultimately provoking an international economic slowdown.
Nervousness about the banks is in large part responsible for the decline of the yen. The joint intervention on June 17 bolstered the yen initially, but now it is slipping again, having weakened 0.14 yen today in New York, to 142.44 to the dollar. If the yen falls further, it could escalate the Asian crisis to a new level, particularly if China devalues its currency.
Japan's big banks generally suffer from similar problems. All have far more bad debt than would be acceptable in the United States, but some are stronger than others. Bad loans as a percentage of equity range from 90 percent at Sanwa Bank to 371 percent at Nippon Credit Bank -- compared with an average of 58 percent at the 22 largest United States banks during the height of the American savings and loan crisis in the late 1980's. Among the stronger banks, Sumitomo Bank is a part owner of Goldman, Sachs, while Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is viewed as fundamentally sound.
Anxieties have been raised in the last couple of weeks over the status of Long-Term Credit Bank, an institution set up after World War II to provide long-term loans to help finance economic rebuilding.
Traditionally, the Government dealt with ailing banks by merging them with stronger ones. Thus, the current banking landscape is a kaleidoscope of banks piled upon banks.
Long-Term Credit's search for a merger partner has reportedly included talks with Nippon Credit Bank, which was essentially bailed out more than a year ago with an injection of new capital, and with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, itself the result of a rescue merger between Dai-Ichi Bank and Nippon Kangyo Bank. Other market-moving reports said that Long-Term Credit was turning to the ailing Daiwa Bank. American regulators ordered its United States operations shut down in 1995, after a bond trader incurred more than $1 billion in losses and then tried, along with the bank, to cover up the losses.
Long-Term Credit may have found a match. Today it confirmed that it was discussing a possible merger with Sumitomo Trust and Banking, a smaller bank specializing in money management for institutional investors that has been forging ties with foreign companies like Citibank.
Not everyone gets rescued, as Yamaichi Securities, a brokerage firm, discovered when it went under last November. Back then, Fuji Bank, a giant, somewhat wobbly bank that is also the Government's paying agent, was Yamaichi's main banker, and its decision not to save Yamaichi was considered rational by the market. But a few months later, tradition got the better of Fuji when it stepped forward to support Yasuda Trust and Banking, an ailing trust bank in Fuji's group of companies.
How did Japan's banks come to be so weak?
During the "bubble economy" of the late 1980's, Japanese land prices soared to ridiculous levels, and it was said that the Imperial Palace grounds in central Tokyo were worth as much as all of California. Japanese banks went on a lending spree, expanding their loan portfolios by $3.6 trillion -- a figure equivalent to 72 percent of the entire Japanese economy -- and in many cases taking buildings as collateral.
The real estate market collapsed under its own weight, with prime Tokyo properties falling to perhaps 10 percent of their peak values. The result is that perhaps $600 billion in loans may be unrecoverable.
Banks have been reluctant to sell property at these prices, and so there is almost no active real estate market. No one knows the market price or the true level of bad loans.
"The market is very inactive," said Teizo Taya, a managing director at the Daiwa Institute of Research. "There are no buyers."
The Government did little about the loans for eight years, thinking that if only property prices would rise again, the problem would right itself. And, indeed, if property prices soared again, borrowers could make payments and the bad loans would then become good.
"I don't see a quick turnaround," said Osamu Aoi, director at the Eiwa Real Estate Company. "I'm covering the downside. I'm very pessimistic. You have to have maximum pessimism toward Japanese real estate in order to survive."
Another problem haunting the banking system is that lending in Japan has been a murky process. Loan documents are short and scanty, if they exist at all, and bankers often performed little analysis on the creditworthiness of the borrower or on the viability of the project.
Often they lent simply on relationships, or because they owned shares in the companies asking for loans. That in turn makes collecting on bad loans a bit awkward.
"The banks have been avoiding drastic change," said Heizo Take naka, professor of economics at Keio University. "Even the president of a bank doesn't understand his own loan portfolio."
So far, the banks have been reluctant to write off bad loans, partly because they do not have enough in profits or in capital to absorb those losses. "They have a lot of loans on their books at the original value and they may have to write them off at 20 to 30 cents on the dollar," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. "They don't want to acknowledge the fact that 70 to 80 percent of the value of those loans has disappeared."
The banks are also reluctant to foreclose on loans, seizing property, evicting clients and being publicly branded as heartless capitalists.
Some bankers are also afraid of foreclosing on properties occupied by anyone affiliated with the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia, who have set up shop in many buildings that are the collateral for loans.
In 1994, an executive director in the Nagoya branch of Sumitomo Bank, one of Japan's most innovative and largest banks, was fatally shot. News reports suggested that his murder might have been related to efforts to try to collect on bad loans related to the Yakuza.
The bad loan crisis has done more than create risks about the future. It has also had some direct effects on Japan's real economy, exacerbating the recent recession.
The most alarming problem for many ordinary Japanese businesses has been a credit squeeze. Banks are calling loans from small and medium-sized businesses, or even from the affiliates of their big clients, and this is crimping investment.
Paradoxically, the credit squeeze has been intensified by the Government's efforts to liberalize the banking sector. The Government has been trying to restructure the financial industry, imposing stricter rules and embarking on a broad program of liberalization called the Big Bang. In the process of preparing for these changes, Japanese banks have been trying to trim their assets to meet capital adequacy requirements.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE INVESTORS;
No Executives on Trip, a Hint That Commercial Ties Are Maturing

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
To learn more about the state of relations between the United States and China, look at a few of the things that are not happening during President Clinton's nine-day trip to China.
Though he has an official delegation of 1,000 people, not one represents an American company. Some United States companies will sign contracts during the visit, but Mr. Clinton does not plan to attend that ceremony. The President considered stopping by a new General Motors Corporation auto factory in Shanghai, but decided against it. 
 None of that means business has fallen off the United States-China agenda. In fact, Mr. Clinton may be downplaying commercial links precisely because they have become such a dominant bilateral issue: The political scandal made up of China's business ambitions, high-tech exports and campaign contributions has dogged him at home.
More broadly, the fact that the President's trip focuses on diplomatic strategy, culture and tourism instead of commerce is a sign that business ties have in some ways outgrown the contract-by-contract nurturing required during the 1980's or the early 1990's, when many visiting American dignitaries traveled with planes full of chief executives seeking high-level contacts.
"China is not exactly virgin territory for American business," said Robert A. Kapp, president of the United States-China Business Council. "They are there in force. It is not as though they need the President to let them in on the best kept secret in world trade."
Since the mid-1980's, when the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, the former American Motors and a handful of other pioneers first planted stakes in China, investment has gone from adventurous to ordinary. More than half of the Fortune 500 companies have operations there, and smaller companies are also active, down to entrepreneurs whose only business is in China. In the early part of this decade, many companies set up factories in China to manufacture goods for export or began aggressively marketing their products in China, a spree that shows few signs of letting up despite China's slowing economic growth.
Last year, American companies had two-way trade with China valued at about $75 billion. They have invested a cumulative $36 billion, eight times as much as they had committed when President Bush visited China in 1989, the last American leader to make the trip. Among Asian countries, only Japan has a bigger business relationship with the United States.
Like the broader relationship, the state of commercial ties has long been described in absolutes. Chinese Government officials are seen as either friends or foes of business. The China market is called a salvation for some companies and a sinkhole for others.
But after two decades of investing, hyperbole has given way to sober assessments of the pluses and minuses of doing business in what many call the world's most challenging emerging market. American companies have been runaway successes; others have proven dismal failures. Most big companies say they are there for the long term and are prepared to take their lumps along the way.
The Eastman Kodak Company is a good example. The company struggled for years to distribute its film there, while many local companies sell lower-grade product and enjoy Government protection. But earlier this year, Beijing approved Kodak's longstanding request to buy out three Chinese competitors, to open two factories and to put its bright yellow boxes on store shelves nationwide. Kodak has announced plans to invest $1 billion over the next two years.
"It took us several years to get the deal we wanted. You have to have patience and the willingness to stick it out," said David Swift, president of Kodak's China operation. "But since we got the license, everything has been superb."
Kodak claims to sell more film in China than any other company, domestic or foreign. Moreover, China has become Kodak's No. 3 worldwide market, behind the United States and Germany and ahead of Japan.
Vast advertising has helped many American brands gain ground in China. Four out of five Chinese consumers surveyed by the Gallup Organization knew Coca-Cola, more than recognized any other foreign brand name. The Procter & Gamble Company's Head and Shoulders shampoo and the Chrysler Corporation's Jeep sport-utility vehicle, made in China by the American companies, were also in the top five.
Profits have followed, though not as reliably as some investors might have hoped. Figures are hard to track, as many United States multinationals decline to break out sales and profits by country. But the evidence suggests that businesses can operate profitably in China provided they do what they would need to do anywhere else: Develop good business plans, make products people can afford to buy and beat the competition.
One survey conducted by A. T. Kearney, a Chicago-based consulting firm, asked the bosses of 70 multinationals how their ventures in China were performing. They responded that two out of five of their China ventures -- many have more than one -- were operating in the black.
They said they expected the rest to break even within three years of their start-ups.
The Finance Ministry has reported similar results. A survey completed last year found that 40 percent of foreign businesses earned profits in 1996. The rest broke even or ran losses. Given the huge volume of investments in the mid-1990's, which funded tens of thousands of new ventures along China's eastern coast, some analysts say they are surprised that so many can operate profitably.
"I don't think anyone finds it easy," said Rich Miskewicz, Kearney's managing director for greater China. "But they are sticking it out and many are reaching profitability within the time frame they planned, sometimes even faster."
But for every success story there is at least one bitter memory.
The Ameritech Corporation, the Chicago-based Baby Bell, sought to get into the business of providing cellular phone service in China, investing $20 million in a venture there. But last year the company pulled out, citing persistent regulatory obstacles.
Caterpillar Inc., the heavy equipment maker, gave up on a troubled joint venture with a Shanghai company, saying it had badly overestimated the market in China for diesel engines. It remains committed to China, however, with several other factories there. The Whirlpool Corporation opened four factories in China to make household appliances in the mid-1990's, but closed two last year. The company said the local competitors proved tougher than anticipated.
Among other persistent complaints, businesses say China has a weak legal system that does not enforce contracts reliably.
American companies lose billions of dollars a year there because Chinese companies make illegal copies of Prozac, Windows 95 and "Titanic," and many famous drugs, software, movies and music that carry American trademarks and copyrights.
Moreover, some areas where American companies have shown themselves to be fierce competitors elsewhere in the world are effectively off limits to foreign investors in China. Retail and distribution, banking and transportation are a few industries where bans or restrictions make it difficult to invest. American officials complain that such barriers help China run a $50 billion trade surplus with the United States, second only to Japan's, creating political waves in Congress.
Virtually all investors in China face some political risk, both in China and at home, though many have learned to keep their heads down when tensions rise. Some companies expanded through the political repression during and after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.
Those that have withdrawn have sometimes regretted it. Levi Strauss & Company closed up shop in 1994, saying Beijing's violations of human rights made it an unfit place to invest. The company returned this spring, saying it wanted to "untie its hands" and resume doing business in one of the world's biggest market for jeans.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE OVERVIEW;
Tiananmen Comment Leads to Clinton-Jiang Debate

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Saturday, June 27

 BODY:
President Clinton and the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, on live television, engaged in an extraodinary, and at times heated, debate today over China's human rights record.
In a joint appearance after a two-hour summit meeting, the two Presidents announced a sheaf of agreements, but offered sharply different interpretations of the Tiananmen Square protests nine years ago that ended in the deaths of hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators. 
 Mr. Clinton said that China was "wrong" to violently crush the demonstrations and said that China's political and economic development -- and its acceptance by the rest of the world -- were threatened by an excessive search for internal order.
Mr. Jiang retorted that Mr. Clinton was viewing events in China from the luxury of America's wealth and long history of social stability.
And he said of the Tiananmen "disturbances" of June 1989, "The Chinese people have long drawn its own conclusion. Had the Chinese Government not taken the resolute measures, we could not have enjoyed the stability we are enjoying today."
Mr. Jiang said that China is a socialist country with a different political and social system than the United States. And he pointedly noted, "No country's human rights situation is perfect."
The Chinese President offered Mr. Clinton a chance to respond, which he eagerly seized. Mr. Clinton said that he understood China's desire for social stabilty because of centuries of upheaval, disruption and anarchy. But he said that advanced societies accepted a compromise between freedom and order.
"If you have a lot of personal freedom, some people may abuse it," Mr. Clinton said. "But if you are so afraid of personal freedom because of the abuse, and if you limit personal freedom too much, you pay an even greater price."
The debate followed a welcoming ceremony on Tiananmen Square, the vast expanse through which modern Chinese history has flowed, from the declaration of the Communist state in 1949 to the crushing of protest 40 years later.
Although Mr. Clinton defended his appearance before the Great Hall of the People on the edge of Tiananmen Square as the expected behavior of a state visitor to China, in his remarks later, the President referred to the site of the 1989 student-led demonstrations that ended in terror and bloodshed.
"For all of our agreements we still disagree about the meaning of what happened then. I believe, and the American people believe, that the use of force and the tragic loss of lives -- was wrong. I believe, and the American people believe, that freedom of speech, association, and religion are, as recognized by the U.N. Charter, the right of people everywhere and should be protected by their governments," the President said.
He did not abandon the human rights issue, but went on to say:
"We have developed a relationship of openness and candor. When we differ, as we do from time to time, we speak openly and candidly. It is well known that the principal area of our difference in recent years is over questions of human rights."
Beyond human rights, much of the remainder of the joint news conference in the Great Hall was devoted to the announcements of a series of agreements including a pledge to redirect the nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles now aimed at each other's cities.
The step is largely symbolic, because such weapons can be changed back in a matter of minutes.
Mr. Jiang also agreed that China would "actively study" joining the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international agreement governing the sale of certain missiles and missile technology. China has resisted the pact because missile exports are a key money-maker for the military. No timetable was set for China's actually joining the regime.
The two countries also announced an agreement on a joint statement on the nuclear arms race now under way in South Asia, including pledges not to export to India or Pakistan any missiles, missile equipment or materials capable of delivering nuclear weapons. The agreement covers only medium- and long-range missiles.
China has also agreed to permit inspections of Chinese sites receiving high-technology equipment from the United States to assure that it is being put to its intended use and not diverted for military purposes.
This provision has gained increased importance in recent weeks with disclosures that China may have used commercial satellites for military communications, and earlier revelations that computers supposedly for industrial applications had been diverted to military installations.
But there was no concrete progress on a number of American human rights concerns, including the treatment of Tibet and an accounting for hundreds of political prisoners.
An American official involved in the summit talks said he was hopeful that signs of progress on rights might come in the weeks and months after Mr. Clinton leaves China.
"Sometimes things are not announced at the summit, but happen afterward," this official said.
The leaders also agreed to expand the Peace Corps presence here and to work toward new cooperation on legal reforms, environmental programs and a new clean-energy project to reduce the emissions of coal-burning power plants.
The summit results amount to a "pretty substantial package," the official said. But many of the military and nonproliferation items were expected and represented at best incremental steps.
At this morning's ceremonies Mr. Clinton stood stiffly as the People's Liberation Army band played "The Star-Spangled Banner" and an evocative 21-gun cannonade rang out across the square. The gunfire continued through the playing of the Chinese national anthem, "March of the Volunteers."
When the two Presidents finished reviewing the troops, they turned and walked along a red carpet toward the steps of the Great Hall of the People, smiling and chatting. In 13 minutes, the ceremony, which stirred such memories and generated such controversy, was over.
The ceremony came at the start of a one-day summit meeting that has already been marred by the detention and harassment of several Chinese political dissidents.
The dispute forced the President and his senior aides into a defensive crouch and threatened to undermine China's central goal of the summit -- a portrait of a "new China" of greater economic and personal freedom.
Mr. Clinton's appearance on the square this morning dramatized this nation's struggle between memory and forgetting.
The Chinese leadership hopes to consign to history the events of the spring of 1989, when indelible images of blood-letting in the streets and of a lone protester standing before a column of tanks were broadcast around the world. The events are the subject of a continuing dispute in China, even at high levels of the party.
In a letter to the party's Central Committee, Zhao Ziyang, who has been under house arrest since he was ousted as Communist Party chief at the time of Tiananmen, challenged the nation's leaders to admit that the incident was reprehensible as well as an immense political blunder.
Mr. Clinton, harshly criticized in the United States for lending his prestige to Beijing's leaders by attending the ceremony, hopes that his presence here will force the world to remember that bloody night.
On Friday, the White House sharply criticized Beijing for the harassment of dissidents on the first day of Mr. Clinton's state visit, calling the detentions "thoroughly unacceptable."
But the President did not take steps to impose any punishment or withhold any favors in response.
Using unusually harsh language, Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, said the Chinese internal security apparatus was "doing what comes naturally" by harassing outspoken opponents of the Government who officials fear might embarrass Beijing during the President's visit.
"People are not debris to be swept up for a visitor," Mr. Berger said at a briefing for reporters on Friday in Xian, before the Presidential entourage flew to Beijing for the summit meeting. "We certainly will not accept this."
Human rights groups reported that four dissidents were detained in two Chinese cities and one removed from Xian in the hours before Mr. Clinton's arrival Thursday night.
China demonstrated little concern about the detentions, denying that anyone had actually been "arrested" and offering American diplomats no explanation for their actions. Chinese authorities routinely round up dissidents and other potential troublemakers before important events.
Mr. Berger tried to explain Beijing's crackdown on dissidents as a remnant of its police-state past, a preference for order over political freedom. He said the repression was diminishing, if slowly.
"China is changing, but there are still forces that are pulling the other direction, that are resisting," Mr. Berger said. "I think China's human rights record is terrible. I think China is an authoritarian nation, as I've said before. I think there's been some progress in human rights, but it has been not nearly enough.
"In the area of public dissent, they are still totally unacceptable. I don't think this is directed at President Clinton. The fact that it happens generally in connection with these kinds of visits, it is not appropriate, it is not necessary," he said.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Clinton said he found reports of the detentions "disturbing," but gave no indication that he would change his approach to China in response. "I think it makes the case, it makes it all the more important that we continue to work with the Chinese and engage them."
Mike Jendrzejczyk, director of Human Rights Watch Asia, said the Administration's unwillingness to respond with more than words was a sign that the White House was "desperate not to offend the Chinese."
The White House has been pressing for China to permit the live, nationwide broadcast of Mr. Clinton's Monday speech, in which the President is expected to deliver his strongest message on human rights.
Beijing has resisted, and White House officials said today that it appeared possible that the speech would be seen everywhere but China.
By the same token,at today's ceremony, even the most ardent fans barely got a glimpse of the ceremony. The central area of Tiananmen Square itself was swept clean of any spectators, who were kept on the north side of the square by the entrance to the Forbidden City.
"We couldn't see anything," said Wang Jie, 32, a shoemaker. "It would have been better to watch TV."
Mr. Wang's colleague, Li Changping, said most Chinese have warm feelings for Mr. Clinton and wanted to see him. "We got up at 3 in the morning to come here," said Mr. Li. "We like Clinton a lot."

The Productive Edge
 How U.S. Industries Are Pointing the Way
 to a New Era of Economic Growth.
 By Richard K. Lester.
 368 pp. New York:
 W. W. Norton & Company. $29.95. 
 Richard K. Lester believes that America has much more to do to get its economy back on track. For those who read the nation's financial pages, this may come as something of a surprise. Wall Street keeps telling us that the economy is as good as it gets. Alan Greenspan agrees. And the White House takes every opportunity to boast about its financial helmsmanship.
"The Productive Edge" is a necessary corrective to all this economic triumphalism. Despite low rates of unemployment and inflation, Lester reminds us, the economy's long-term health and the nation's standard of living require the revitalization of labor productivity -- the output of goods and services per hour of work. Lester quotes the economist William Baumol: "In terms of human welfare, there is nothing that matters as much in the long run."
But after increasing at a rate of 2.3 percent a year on average from 1870 until the early 1970's, the rate of productivity growth has slowed to about 1 percent a year. The stronger growth of the last two years has not changed this trend. In fact, the current economic expansion, which began in 1991, remains the slowest in the post-World War II period. Family income adjusted for inflation is still no higher than it was in 1989.
In other words, if there really is a new, fast-growing, computer-driven economy, as everyone keeps saying, it has yet to show itself. Even the increase in America's exports, Lester notes, has depended more on the fall of the dollar in the late 1980's and early 1990's than on rising productivity.
Don't think Lester is one of those pessimists American businessmen love to hate. He is, in fact, a resolute optimist. But as the director of M.I.T.'s Industrial Performance Center, he has found that only a small part of what is so enthusiastically preached in corporate America has actually worked. Take highly touted managerial reforms like "total quality management," which emphasizes fulfilling the customer's every desire. "A survey of 500 American manufacturing and service companies," Lester points out, "found that only a third felt that their T.Q.M. programs were having a significant impact on their competitiveness." Or consider corporate reengineering, which eliminates specialized tasks in favor of involving workers in the whole production process. "A detailed analysis of 20 re-engineering projects," Lester says, "revealed that while many had achieved sizable efficiency improvements in individual processes, only a small fraction had delivered significant benefits to the bottom line." And what about all those lay-offs in the name of corporate restructuring? Lester sweepingly concludes that there is "no evidence" that they have raised the competitiveness of American companies.
What Lester makes clear is that the modern business environment, with its many new products and marketing techniques, its mobile capital and far-flung competition, is more volatile and uncertain than it had been for the hundred years of America's industrial development after the Civil War, when mass production was dominant. He claims that business's key task now is to learn how to deal with ambiguity, volatility and profound change.
In such an environment, Lester finds that there are few hard-and-fast rules for success. In the 1980's, for example, the small, often evanescent companies of the semiconductor industry were widely criticized for being too unstable to compete with the large, vertically integrated producers in Japan. It turned out that the entrepreneurial vigor of these companies (perhaps with some assistance from the Federal Government) helped revitalize the industry, enabling it to overtake the Japanese. By contrast, the successful development of the cellular telephone industry is owed to large, well-capitalized businesses like Motorola and Lucent Technologies in the United States, Nokia in Finland and Ericsson in Sweden. Lester recounts in detail the success stories of five such industries to "illustrate the tremendous variation in the processes of industrial transformation that are at work."
Nevertheless, Lester believes there are several "best practices" that can successfully transform America's corporations. What has enabled companies to stand out in an uncertain business environment, he reports, is not widely applauded profit-mindedness so much as a clear, confident vision -- a new product line, an untested technology, an innovative marketing approach, a way to increase quality dramatically. Such companies take risks that often cannot be easily quantified. They learn to use their workers' creative and innovative skills. They break down traditional organizational hierarchies into "small, autonomous units" that can react quickly. They adopt not one or two changes in the workplace but a battery of reforms. They build trust in their employees.
Lester's suggestions admittedly read more like instructions for how to paint a picture or play baseball than for how to achieve business success. They certainly aren't a contemporary equivalent to Frederick Taylor's hard-nosed "scientific management." Still, if the advice sounds warm and fuzzy, it may be all that can be said in this new age. What Lester convincingly shows is that we now live in an economy where innovation matters most, where even the largest companies must emphasize creativity and imagination to compete.
On the other hand, I don't think Lester faces up to the full implications of the uncertain environment. In an economy that needs creative input, it may well be difficult to raise productivity rates very much, no matter what one does. Among the greater ironies of the computer age is the fact that information is cheap and accessible, and so no longer very valuable. What is valuable is what one does with it. And human imagination cannot be mechanized.
This doesn't mean that we can't do better. Lester's sections on work-force reforms and research and development are particularly strong. He also sees a role for government investment in research, as well as in education and infrastructure. He thinks employee benefits like pensions should be made portable. At this point in the nation's overenthusiastic public conversation, it is refreshing to hear several cogent ideas, free of the customary bombast, about how we can genuinely improve matters.

THE ECOLOGY OF EDEN
 By Evan Eisenberg.
 612 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $30. 
 Imagine gazing across a jagged landscape where coils of steam hiss from the ground, hundreds of creatures gather at watering holes and fierce competition determines rank. Depending on whether the steam rises from geothermal vents or manhole covers, this place could be either Yellowstone National Park or Times Square. Yet one represents wilderness, the other civilization, and that dichotomy is the subject of "The Ecology of Eden," a broad rumination by Evan Eisenberg on the fragile state of the earth's natural environment and what might be done to protect it. In this ambitious work, Eisenberg tries to step beyond old arguments, in which civilization and wilderness always seem to be at odds. He argues that the health of planet Earth depends on the health of both: "The human condition is (among other things) the state of trying to keep one's balance on the shifting soil between these two domains. That balancing act is what this book is about."
His story begins with humanity's expulsion from Eden. But it is not about the ecology of Eden; it's about the ecology of what humans were stuck with after being thrown out. Denied Eden's riches and forced to earn a living, humans spread across the globe, building civilizations and mostly ignoring the seemingly endless wilderness. As Eisenberg notes, that was a mistake. Wilderness frightened our ancestors -- but it was also what kept them alive. "Taking over the world is something like taking over a company," he writes. "Either you leave most of the workers in place, or you replace them with others who can get the job done." In the takeover of the world, the "jobs in question are ecological services -- the cycling of water and nutrients; the flow of energy; the dispersal of pollen, seeds and other propagules; the regulation of climate; the balancing of gases in the air -- without which most creatures on earth . . . would perish." During the last 10,000 years, "we have gutted the buildings, fired the employees, sold off the assets," and "the shiny new equipment we have brought in" cannot be trusted to supplant ecological services provided by nature. "By the time we know for sure what the effects are, it will be too late to do much about them."
In the first of the book's four sections, Eisenberg describes changes that have swept over the earth since that expulsion from Eden. He begins with the passage of human ancestors from forests to grasslands and discusses the emergence of agriculture. Then he seems to ricochet all over the place. One minute he talks about the evolutionary origin of cells, then the destruction of topsoil, then the release of starlings in Central Park by a misguided Shakespeare buff who wanted North America to have every species of bird mentioned in the playwright's works.
Eisenberg tries to summarize the current environmental crisis quickly before moving on to a search for a way out of it, a search that occupies most of the book. However, his analysis of the problem relies on poorly chosen examples that don't add up to very much. In recent years, researchers have tried to document rates of species extinction, to show how and where natural habitat is being lost, to monitor pollution and to assess other environmental threats. Inclusion of some of that research would have given strength and currency to Eisenberg's case, but he largely ignores it.
In part two, he takes a long detour through mythology, asking "what ecological facts the myths reflect, cover up or help create." It's an intriguing idea: Perhaps literature and mythology will reveal important insights that haven't been reflected in science. In part three, Eisenberg roams through human history for clues. And in part four, he uses what he has learned to suggest answers to current environmental problems.
I would like to report what he learned, but I am still reeling from one of the most impressive uses of metaphor I have seen. Nowhere does Eisenberg use a simple, descriptive phrase where a metaphor will suffice. Wilderness and civilization become "The Mountain" and "The Tower." "The World Mountain is mythic shorthand for an ecological fact. There are certain places on earth that . . . are spigots for the circulation of wildness through places made hard and almost impermeable by long human use." In one breath, Eisenberg describes the Central Park starlings as "winged mice . . . airborne rats, or great speckled bees . . . leaving a white and malodorous honey behind." Discussing the value of hedgerows and windbreaks as migratory pathways for wildlife, he says "such corridors would turn the walled garden inside out so that, like a Klein bottle, it would contain the universe."
One of the lessons Eisenberg says he learned from mythology and history is that we should collaborate with nature, not fight it. He calls that collaboration "Earth Jazz," and it goes like this: "A good model for the planet might be a bebop quartet led by a saxophonist. . . . If you translate time into space, the sax player into humankind, and the three sidemen into other taxa -- making the piano, say, the nonhuman animals, the bass the plants, the drum set a catchall for fungi, protoctists and bacteria -- you get a lesson in how humans can work with nature." Translation: The hills are alive -- with the sound of music.
At one point he compares nature to the economy, observing that nature is guided by an invisible hand that "sometimes makes a hash of things." But he does not address the serious issue of how commerce and the economy impinge on the environment. Maybe the explanation for the PCB's at the bottom of the Hudson River has less to do with The Mountain and The Tower than with General Electric's unwillingness to pay for the cleanup.
He neatly dismisses most environmentalists as either "deep ecologists" or "planet managers." Deep ecologists hold that "humans have no right to a larger role in nature than raccoons." Planet managers "are the crazed futurists, the sort of people who would make cows legless milk-dispensers, conveniently stackable." One might have hoped for more insightful descriptions.
Eisenberg does have a serious point to make, and it has something to do with collaboration with nature. Without thriving cities, he argues, "the tide of human population must soon overwhelm whatever wilderness is left." That's a useful observation, but he takes it too far. "Cities are natural. Even their unnaturalness is natural, for it springs from our nature." Times Square, in other words, is as natural as Yellowstone? Send in the clowns.

HEADLINE: The Capitalist;
Bottom-Fishing Time?

BYLINE: By Walter Russell Mead; Walter Russell Mead is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

 BODY:
As Indonesia's new president, B.J. Habibie, settles into office, soldiers are returning to their barracks and students to their dorms, and some hardy American investors are mulling over returning to Indonesia.
For investors, getting in on the ground floor of an Indonesian recovery would be a bonanza. In the last year, political instability and Asia's economic turmoil combined to reduce prices of Indonesian debt and equity to almost derisory levels. Bottom-fishing investors can now buy what were once well-regarded companies and financial assets for pennies on the dollar; an economic rebound would make millions for those daring enough to fish in Indonesia's murky, choppy markets.
With Washington and Tokyo seemingly determined to stabilize the yen and promote a regional recovery in Asia, this might look like a good time. But Indonesia's troubles run deep, and what looks like an opportunity today may become a disaster in the not-too-distant future. 
 Indonesia, an archipelago of 13,000-plus islands, is the largest Muslim country in the world and the fourth most populous country overall. Nevertheless, the Indonesian state is fragile. Its 214 million people speak hundreds of different languages. Their backgrounds range from the ritualized and ancient Javanese civilization to tribal cultures of Irian Jaya. As with many African countries, the only thing many of Indonesia's peoples had in common at independence was the experience of colonial domination by the same nation. In Indonesia's case, that was the Dutch, who finally withdrew in 1949.
Bad as the former President, Suharto, was in many respects, he ran a stable regime that kept Indonesia's disparate elements in place. He also steadied a turbulent region while helping to balance China's growing power. The climate of peace and cooperation that Suharto promoted -- notably with his neighbors in Malaysia and Singapore -- did much to set the stage for the region's explosive economic growth.
Suharto relied on the armed forces and the economy to hold the country together. Both were built up -- primarily through patronage and corruption -- under his long reign and both now face the difficult task of gaining popular trust and legitimacy.
That won't be easy, and the main reason is the economy. Indonesians -- like Americans -- seem willing to tolerate presidential hanky-panky when the economy is strong. And for most of Suharto's tenure the economy was extremely strong. Thanks to family planning and economic growth, per capita gross domestic product rose by an average of 4.3 percent annually from 1965 to 1988. As the Far Eastern Economic Review points out, this was one of the highest sustained increases in living standards in the world. The poverty rate dropped from an estimated 70 percent of the population in 1970 to about 15 percent two decades later. At the same time, however, Suharto allowed the Chinese minority in Indonesia -- about 3 percent of the population -- to control an estimated 70 percent of the national economy.
Now that the economy -- and living standards -- are in free fall, there are widespread calls to investigate the Suharto family's extensive web of partnerships and cross holdings. Because Suharto did so much of his business with ethnic Chinese, and because the Chinese prospered so greatly during his tenure, calls to investigate and return Suharto family wealth could turn into something like a general assault on the Chinese businessmen who largely control the economy.
The trouble, however, is that once the Indonesians start picking at the threads of economic corruption and political cronyism, the whole fabric of their national life could unravel. It isn't just a few bankers and real-estate developers who are tied to the former ruling family; the whole business class was implicated in an economic development that was systematically perverted to favor the Suharto clan. And it isn't just a handful of generals who participated in repression and corruption under the ancien regime; over the last 30 years, Suharto reshaped the Indonesian armed forces in his image.
Meanwhile, a vicious circle is likely to develop as economic turmoil leads to more anti-Chinese agitation and to calls for new trials and investigations that a weak Government may be powerless to resist. This would further undermine confidence among the country's business elite, leading to more capital flight and more economic turmoil. Having repressed moderate politicians and prevented responsible opposition leaders from developing strong national organizations, Indonesia's elites may now face an inexorable rise of popular fury as living standards continue to fall.
If this scenario unfolds, both Indonesia and the region are in for much more tumult than we have yet seen. Indonesia could well be in the early moments of a two-stage revolution -- like the Russian and Iranian revolutions. In Stage 1, the old emperor goes out; in Stage 2, an ineffectual transitional regime is overthrown by a radical and more permanent successor.
Czarist Russia was a promising emerging market and a friend of the United States before its October Revolution. Indonesia, many of whose people rightly accuse Washington of supporting Suharto through decades of repression, could yet emerge as a world-class foreign-policy and economic headache. Without a quick economic recovery, Indonesia could all too easily slide into chaos or move toward an anti-Western radicalism, conceivably with Islamist overtones.

HEADLINE: Harry and Bess at Home

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN; SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, a former Times correspondent, lives in Kansas.

 BODY:
AMID suburban sprawl and six lanes of traffic whizzing along Highway 71 just south of Kansas City, Mo., the simple sign seemed to peek out from the past. "Truman Farm. Next Right," it announced. I swung off, following the ramp past the sign welcoming me to Grandview, Mo., then under the railroad overpass and up to Blue Ridge Boulevard. A strip mall on the corner offered Arby's, White Castle, Blockbuster Video and more. As I continued southwest along Blue Ridge, the unadorned backside of the Truman Corners Shopping Center was on the left, Pizza Hut on the right.
Finally I picked out the somber white farmhouse amid the endless stretch of franchises and low-slung commercial buildings. I drove into what remains of the 600-acre farm where Harry S. Truman learned to plow a straight row behind a team of horses and dealt with the frustrations of an early life that brought him neither financial nor career success. 
 Visiting the places that formed the 33d President of the United States, and to which he returned for the final two decades of his life, means making the trip back in time through traffic jams, commerce and blight. Nevertheless, I found that with a little planning it was possible to immerse myself in life as he lived it and hardly notice the end of the 20th century zooming by.
I took along David McCullough's book "Truman" (Simon & Schuster, 1992). Although I grew up a bare 30 miles away and the Truman name was a fixture in my life, opening the book to the sections about his life in Missouri was like being accompanied by an enchanting storyteller as I traveled from the farm in Grandview north to Independence and the famous white Victorian house where he spent summers during his Presidency and where he lived in retirement, then to the library and museum built in his honor after he left the White House in 1953. This was a timely moment to make a Truman pilgrimage because the library has mounted a yearlong exhibition that is a tonic for cynicism about love and Presidents. "Dear Bess . . . Love Letters from the President," is a wonderfully moving sampling of the 1,300 letters Truman wrote to Bess during their long courtship and marriage, coupled with a display of 15 of her letters to him. Although his letters have long been available to researchers, this is the first time that Margaret Truman Daniel has allowed any of her mother's letters to be exhibited.
Just three or four acres of land now surround the Grandview farmhouse, which was restored and opened to the public four years ago. It was not yet open for the season on the day in mid-February when I visited, but I strolled the grounds at leisure and peeked through the lace curtains at the windows. A few dilapidated farm buildings, including the outhouse, are scattered in the back. It was tempting to become angry about the garden apartments under construction almost against the fence on one side of the farm and the helter-skelter commercial development everywhere else. A Roosevelt or a Rockefeller might have preserved these lands intact, maybe as a park rolling down toward the Blue River. But for Harry Truman and his brother, Vivian, and sister, Mary Jane, that was not an option. They needed the money provided by suburban development on the land inherited from their mother, Martha Ellen.
"Take care of the land, and it will take care of you," one of my grandfathers used to say as he worked his own land a county removed from that of the Trumans. Certainly the sale of the farm brought Harry Truman a measure of financial security in the years before Congress granted a pension to former Presidents.
The farm was passed down from the Youngs, Harry Truman's maternal grandparents, who settled it in 1867. The Trumans lived here with them during Harry's early years, then moved away -- to farms of their own at various times, to Independence and also to Kansas City -- before returning. This was the family's refuge during years of struggle, the place to which it came back when all else failed. Lacking the money to go to college, Harry Truman went to work in a bank after high school, but in his mid-20's he had to return to help on the farm.
From the farm I followed Blue Ridge Boulevard, which rambles north and slightly east into Independence, less than 20 miles. Despite its scenic-sounding name, Blue Ridge teems with with urban grit and suburban sameness. But the old heart of Independence is largely intact and, despite some decay, it remains a charming place, just 15 miles east of the skyscrapers in downtown Kansas City.
The logical starting point is the house at 219 North Delaware Street, surely one of the most nostalgia-inducing houses in America and once the embodiment of the expression Summer White House. Bess Truman grew up in the house, which had been passed down from her grandparents. Across the street is the plainer one where Harry Truman's beloved cousins, the Noland sisters, lived, and from which he set out to return a cake plate in 1910, an act generally considered the beginning of his courtship of Bess Wallace.
The National Park Service guides visitors through the screened porch at the back and into the house through the kitchen. The simplicity of the Trumans' lives is revealed in the kitchen with its apple-green cabinets and the matching table, with some of the paint nicked off its legs. The Trumans ate breakfast together here in the years after the White House. The dining room, though small, is more elegant, with ornate silver pieces from Bess's family.
Typical of houses built in the 19th century, it has a parlor and a sitting room off the center hall in the front of the house. There is also a small study lined with books, where Bess and Harry spent many hours during their later years. Stress cracks have appeared in the ceiling of the formal parlor, where five United States Presidents came to call at various times, and water stains show through the wallpaper of the sitting room. The upstairs is still reserved for their daughter, though she hasn't used it for years. Harry's hat and raincoat hang on hooks by the side door, along with one of Bess's coats.
Among the small-town qualities preserved by Independence, which now has 112,000 people and is surrounded on three sides by Kansas City, is being able to walk to many places of interest. From the Truman house, you can stroll north along Delaware for several blocks and see the other impressive houses from early in the century. I walked east four blocks along Maple, as Truman often did -- to Independence Square.
Dominating the square is the Independence branch of the Jackson County Courthouse, a two-story red brick structure with a white cupola and a statue of Harry Truman outside. As a local politician, Truman was responsible for the renovation of the building in 1933. Although most county business is conducted from the new annex nearby, it was fun to walk the halls of the old building. The office that was once Mr. Truman's -- No. 109 -- is preserved as a historic site and open to the public two days a week, but it was not open the day I was there.
I set aside most of a day to visit the library and museum, about a dozen blocks north and west of the square. The low, two-level modern building is arranged around an open-air courtyard where Harry and Bess are buried. What catches the eye on entering is the Thomas Hart Benton mural, "Independence and the Opening of the West," depicting the kinds of people who came to and through Independence in its formative years -- Indians, French trappers, white settlers from the East, black slaves, outlaws and others. The crusty Truman hadn't been an admirer of the paintings of his equally crusty fellow Missourian, but a common friend brought them together, and before the two-year project was finished they were bourbon-drinking buddies.
Through the doorway, a glass case displays the small wooden sign that sat on the Oval Office desk: "The buck stops here." Straight ahead through the next door is the re-creation of the Oval Office of the early 50's. An audio recording of Truman comes on as you step through the office door, and he welcomes you and mentions several items of interest.
First elected to the Senate in 1934, Truman became Vice President 10 years later after unseating the incumbent, Henry Wallace, in an open floor fight at the Democratic Convention in Chicago. He became President in April 1945, on the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It fell to him to make the decision to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in August 1945 to bring the war with Japan to a quick end. He also dealt with such enormous issues as the economic recovery of Europe, the beginnings of the cold war with the Soviet Union, the creation of the state of Israel and the racial integration of the United States armed forces. Many of the objects, both small and grand, that fill the rest of the museum are connected to these events.
Nothing, however, reveals Harry Truman's personality like the selection of letters covering his relationship with Bess from 1911 until his death, in 1972. In the early letters, he could have been any young Missouri farmer of his time, complaining about having to rise early and labor long. On June 22, 1911, he said the long dry spell was going to make water and potatoes "as much a luxury as pineapples and diamonds." Then he suddenly changed his tone: "Speaking of diamonds, would you wear a solitaire on your left hand should I get it?" He went on to say that, at the moment, he was "only a kind of good-for-nothing American farmer," but that he had always had "a sneakin' notion that some day maybe I'd amount to something."
She turned him down, but his return letter on July 12 suggested that he wasn't giving up. He said he "really never had any desire to make love to a girl just for the fun of it, and you have always been the reason." But two years later she decided she was in love with him, and he wrote back suggesting a secret engagement. Meanwhile, he was pursuing financial success with mining and oil exploration ventures in Kansas and Oklahoma. They did not succeed, and on May 27, 1917, he wrote: "I seem to have a grand and admirable ability for calling tails when heads come up."
That summer fate intervened. Harry's National Guard regiment was mobilized and sent first to Fort Sill, Okla., then to the battlefront in Europe. As he prepared to leave, he wrote: "Bess, I'm dead crazy to ask you to marry me before I leave but I'm not going to because I don't think it would be right for me to ask you to tie yourself to a prospective cripple -- or a sentiment." He added: "If you don't marry me before I go, you may be sure that I'll be just as loyal to you as if you were my wife."
The young man who had been unable to get into West Point because of his bad eyes distinguished himself on the battlefields and came home a captain in early 1919. Both now pushing 35, they had agreed -- finally -- to get married. Bess wrote before he left Europe that he could "invite the entire 35th Division to our wedding if you want to."
A few years into marriage, he wrote her from summer reserve officers' camp that he had not slept well the night before because "I wanted someone to keep me covered up and to hug." She wrote back the next day, calling him "Dear old Sweetness." Even after he went to Washington, the letters reveal two people who never stopped missing each other when they were apart. They talked about things as mundane as new seat covers for the family car and as extraordinary as the formal dinner he gave for Churchill and Stalin during the Potsdam Conference in 1945. At times when he was alone in Washington and she was caring for her ailing mother in Independence, he would send handwritten letters by regular airmail, with the White House as the return address.
Sometimes Truman wrote even when they weren't apart, as he did in an anniversary note on June 28, 1948. "Twenty-nine years! It seems like 29 days," he wrote, adding "You still are on the pedestal where I placed you that day in Sunday School in 1890. What an old fool I am." On their 38th anniversary, in 1957, after they were back in Independence, he wrote a note summarizing the highlights of each year of their married life and added that there were "only 37 to go for the diamond jubilee."
They didn't make it that far. He died Dec. 26, 1972 at age 88: she died on Oct. 18, 1982, at 98. But they left a diamond in these letters. For that, and for letting us come into their house through the kitchen door, I can almost forgive Harry Truman for selling off the farmland.

De Tocqueville observed that envy of one's economic betters is America's peculiar disease, and your issue on money offers evidence that the patient is in intensive care. While an obsession with "getting and spending" often seems to result in anxiety and dissatisfaction, charity toward those lower on the economic ladder yields just the opposite. Judging from the chorus of whiners depicted in your magazine, the current boom has produced more millionaires than philanthropists.

HEADLINE: Aiding the Poor With Low-Interest Loans

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WHEN in 1983 several Roman Catholic Religious Orders in the New York City area decided on moral ground -- opposition to the practice of apartheid -- to divest their stock holdings in corporations doing business with South Africa, a question about money arose. "What are we going to do with the proceeds from the stock, which amounted to $325,000," said George C. Schmitz, a brother of the Holy Cross, a French religious order with American headquarters in New Rochelle. The answer they came up with was, "Let's put it to use in our own communities at the disposal of nonprofit organizations working with the poor."
And so the Leviticus 25:23 Alternative Fund was founded as a nonprofit community development revolving loan fund by several religious members of the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment. The name of the fund was taken from the Book of Leviticus, in which God calls the people to a jubilee that restores the earth and protects common lands as well as the poor. The charter members of the fund were 27 Catholic religious orders, including 11 from Westchester, which were coalition members. The concept of the revolving loan fund, an offshoot of the divestment strategy, was that its members should pool their money and invest it locally, providing loans at below-market value to community organizations that were striving to meet the basic human needs of the poor, said Mr. Schmitz, the fund's first paid employee. 
 Mr. Schmitz was recruited to become the fund's executive director 13 years ago while he was serving as director of international students at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind. "Before that I was the principal of a Catholic high school in Connecticut," he said. "That's where I gained my business experience.
"Membership in the Leviticus Fund is open to faith-based organizations, which support our mission of socially motivated lending through alternative investment.
"Combining financial return with social concern is our motto. Member organizations make a minimum loan of $5,000 to the fund for five years, in return for which they receive an annual interest rate of 2 percent. Currently, we have 78 members, 13 in Westchester, and they represent 4 religious denominations, including Episcopal, United Methodist and Reformed Church as well as Roman Catholic. Individuals can also participate -- associate members who make a minimum loan of $1,000 to the fund for one year. Their interest rate is also 2 percent, far below a conventional investment where they might be expected to earn 5 percent or more. So you see that members and associates of Leviticus Fund place as much importance on the social return on their loan as they do on the financial return."
The fund's first loan, made in 1984, was for $10,000 to a sweat equity group, which was converting a tenement into 16 housing units on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. "Since then, we've closed 96 loans, totaling over $4 million, loans that have been instrumental in leveraging over $37 million in public and private dollars for our 68 borrowers," Mr. Schmitz said. "Twenty-one of the loans we've made have been to organizations in Westchester. To date, our lending in Westchester totals $12 million."
The loans have aided the development of 540 affordable-housing units, 9 day-care centers and 4 small businesses. When asked about the fund's losses, Mr. Schmitz said they were modest. "In 15 years, we've only had to write off $58,000, or 1.3 percent, which I think makes us the envy of any conventional lender."
The Leviticus Fund, which is not government regulated, Mr. Schmitz said, is a patient lender. "We can be more flexible than conventional lenders," he said. "We make allowances for extenuating circumstances. For instance, if borrowers run into unforeseen difficulties and need more time, we will work with them to develop repayment schedules."
If such a considerate approach does not sound businesslike, nothing could be further from the truth, said G. Anthony Hoeltzel, an Episcopal priest and executive director of the Sharing Community in Yonkers, a borrower from the fund. He is also a member of the board of the Leviticus Alternative Fund.
"The business practices of the fund are conducted on a high, professional level," he said. "Borrowers must supply a well-documented business plan. The risk level comes under serious review, and there must be someone responsible and knowledgeable at the head of the borrowing organization."
The Sharing Community has received two loans from the fund, one in 1993 and another in 1995, both to buy property in Yonkers to build affordable housing for single people who are homeless.
"Leviticus Fund is an absolutely fantastic organization that closes a critical gap in the system," Mr. Hoeltzel said. "Ours is a common problem. Although we had a $2.5 million grant from the state for two buildings for permanent and transient residents, the catch was that we needed about $250,000 in order to buy the land, get approval for the building plan and the license. The way the state grant award was constructed was that we had to have all those things in place before the state money kicked in. Without the loan from Leviticus, it's hard to imagine what we would have done."
The 1995 loan was a bridge loan, which has already been repaid, Mr. Hoeltzel said, "The 1993 loan was converted into a six-year construction loan," he said. "The buildings, six stories high -- two stories for transient residents and four stories for permanent residents. Every person has a private room and bath. Two people share apartments. Tenants come from all walks of life. We've had former cops, divorced women ranging in age from 25 to 65. Men and women are equally divided, and rents are based on whatever the recipients receive from Social Services."
The Sharing Community also provides job-training counseling and other programs to those in need.
What is heartening, Mr. Hoeltzel said, is the turnover in permanent residents, which is "100 percent since we opened the doors."
He continued: "What it means is that we have succeeded in helping people find their way back into the mainstream. They find jobs, and they leave and set up their own homes."
In January, Leviticus started a $920,000 program to make low-interest loans to day-care centers. "It is in response to a study that showed an increased demand for child-care centers because of welfare reform," Mr. Schmitz said. "The loans provide construction financing and working capital for startups and funding to expand and upgrade other child-care centers."
Citibank, Chase Manhattan and the Republic National Bank have given grants and loans to the program. To be eligible for a loan of up to $150,000, a child-care center must be licensed by the state, with at least 50 percent of the children from low-income families. Nonprofit and for-profit organizations are eligible. The loans carry a 5 percent interest rate, well below the prime rate of 8.5 percent. "The rate has been set deliberately low to help those in an industry that traditionally operates on a low profit level," Mr. Schmitz said.
A program allowing minority businesses and female business owners to borrow up to $25,000, at 2 points over prime, has also been started, Mr. Schmitz said.
"In order to be considered for a loan, potential borrowers must present a business plan they have developed through a program such as the one given by the Small Business Development Corporation," he explained.

Flex Buildings for High-Tech Companies Proliferate

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
FOR three decades the 273,000-square-foot bakery and corporate office structure was a fixture on Riverview Drive in Totowa. But the bakery, where Thomas's English Muffins were once made, shut down 18 months ago and the site later was sold to new owners who plan to convert it into a high-tech building.
The buyer was Cambridge Hanover L.P., a real estate investment company based in New Canaan, Conn., made up of a group of New York City developers. It acquired the property last April for $6 million and plans to invest at least another $4 million to redevelop it. The seller -- Bestfoods of Englewood Cliffs, which owns Thomas's -- leased back 100,000 square feet of space, primarily for office use. The building is a quarter mile north of Route 46. 
 The conversion of the building, for which approvals still must be secured from Totowa's Planning Board, is expected to start this fall and take six months to complete. The project is one of a spate of high-tech buildings that are being built or converted or areplanned across the state by developers hoping to attract companies that want the flexibility such space offers.
These low-rise structures, also known as flex buildings, generally offer office, research, light assembly and storage space. The space can be carved into individual units, each with its own entrance and utilities.
A few of the projects, like the one in Totowa, include the reuse of former industrial structures. Others involve new buildings being developed on speculation or as build-to-suit deals for specific tenants. In all, the projects will produce some 889,000 square feet of new and renovated space.
Like the state's office and industrial sectors, the high-tech market, which encompasses about 35 million square feet, is benefiting from a strong local and national economy that continues to spur new companies to form and existing ones to expand. That expansiveness, along with the lack of new construction in the last few years, has caused the vacancy rate in the 11-county northern and central New Jersey market to fall to 14 percent as of the first quarter, down from 22 percent a year ago, according to Grubb & Ellis, the national commercial brokerage.
Developers and brokers say tenants in the market for such space include biotech, telecommunications, electronics and pharmaceutical companies within the state. But there is also a growing interest from European concerns in those industries looking to set up offices in New Jersey, which is home to such drug and communications giants as AT&T, Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb, said Timothy R. Comerford, area development manager at Public Service Gas & Electric. The utility is a partner with the state in retaining and attracting businesses.
Many concerns see high-tech buildings as a less costly alternative to pure office space, said Robert L. Sticht, senior vice president at the Edison office of Grubb & Ellis, which represented Bestfoods in the sale of the Totowa property and is now marketing it for Cambridge Hanover.
In turn, an increasing number of tenants are interested in using much and sometimes all of the space in a building for offices, he said, noting that a key ingredient in making these projects successful is to provide sufficient parking.
RECYCLING the Totowa building works because it sits on 17.3 acres and "there is no question that there is a need for reasonably priced single-story office space in that area that is flexible enough to accommodate different kinds of users," said Jonathan Garrity, general partner of Cambridge Hanover.
The partners plan to demolish up to 50,000 square feet that was once part of the bakery, reducing the size of the building to 223,000 square feet and allowing room for additional parking. The rest of the space will be upgraded, adding a new facade, new landscaping and new mechanical systems -- all of which will be done while Bestfoods Baking Company is a tenant within the building.
The 100,000 square feet Bestfoods occupies contains back office space, a retail store and a depot for delivery trucks. The baking operation was consolidated into two other sites in Greenwich Conn., and Frederick, Md.
"Since we no longer needed the majority of the building the logical thing for us to do was to sell it," said Thomas DiPiazza, a company spokesman. Staying in a location "that works for us" and with competitive rents also made sense, he said.
The remaining 123,000 square feet of space, which could be divided into areas as small as 18,000 square feet, will be marketed to both single and multiple tenants, said Mr. Sticht of Grubb & Ellis, noting that rents had not yet been set. Occupancy is expected by the first quarter of 1999.
At Commercenter/Totowa, farther down Riverview Drive, Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, a real estate investment trust based in Cranford, has just completed a 30,600-square-foot building and is nearing completion on a second one with 39,000 square feet.
In late 1995, the company purchased the 47-acre business park, where 330,000 square feet of high-tech space had already been constructed. It is 95 percent leased by tenants taking, on average, 8,000 to 10,000 square feet, said James G. Nugent, senior vice president of leasing at Mack-Cali.
His company pressed ahead with development, Mr. Nugent said, because "there is so much demand for this kind of space in that area." He said that the smaller of the two new buildings was already leased and that once the second one was rented the plan was to start, possibly by the fourth quarter of this year, the final 65,000-square-foot building in the park. Rents are $14 for office space and half that for nonoffice space.
In Parsippany, Wellsford Commercial Properties Trust of Chatham plans to begin work this fall on converting the former Estee Candy warehouse on Lackawanna Avenue into the Morris Technology Center, which will contain 225,000 square feet of space. The company bought the empty, single-story warehouse, set on 21 acres a half mile north of I-80, last December for $7 million and will spend $23 million on renovations.
THE work includes reducing the size of the old warehouse by 42,000 square feet to 127,000 square feet and adding two-story 50,000-square-foot wings on either side of it. The new building will be given a glass-and-masonry facade and a skylit lobby.
Explaining the company's strategy, Richard R. Previdi, its chief operating officer, said:
"We're taking an infill location and renovating it to provide space that will be designed as high-quality offices to meet the demand from tenants who do not want to pay premium rents, but also will be able to accommodate users that want the flexibility of combining offices with other uses." In addition, he said, there is a scarcity of this kind of "hybrid space" in Parsippany.
The project, to be completed in the first quarter of next year, will be marketed to both single users and multiple tenants. Asking rents are expected to range from $18.50 to $23.50 a square foot, depending on tenant improvements, Mr. Previdi said.
Seeing a niche for smaller users, Kessel Associates of Bergenfield broke ground last week on two speculative flex buildings on Wilson Drive off Route 15 in Sparta. Each of the 12,000-square-foot buildings will be able to be divided into areas as small as 3,100 square feet, said Jeffrey Kessel, a partner.
Mr. Kessel said he expected the buildings to draw tenants, many of them start-up companies, from Morris and Passaic Counties and possibly from Orange County, N.Y. Rents will be $12.75 a square foot for office space and $6.75 for nonoffice space.
At the Technology Center of New Jersey along Route 1 in North Brunswick, construction began earlier this month on a 60,000-square-foot building, occupancy of which is expected next spring. It will be the fifth building in the 50-acre park, designed to meet the needs of emerging research and development companies involved in biosciences, micro-electronics, communications technologies and other pursuits.
In the two and a half years since the state, through the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, began developing the center, using public and private funds, 130,000 square feet of space has been constructed, all of which is leased, said Rose M. Smith, spokeswoman for the authority. Base rents at the center, which eventually will contain 800,000 square feet, are $25 a square foot, about 15 percent lower than the rent for comparable space in the area, she said.

HEADLINE: Q&A/Allan H. Weis;
Contest Helps Internet Work for Students

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
AS someone who was involved at Ground Zero with the start of the Internet, Allan H. Weis cringes when he encounters news accounts of the bad aspects of the Web for children, including pornography and lack of content. As president and chief executive officer of the Armonk-based Advanced Network and Services and with a lot of extra money on hand, Mr. Weis and his company decided to do something to change that.
Three years ago, Advanced Network began its yearly Thinkquest contest, where students 12 through 18 are invited to form teams that design Web pages and are eligible for $1 million in prizes and scholarships. The top prize is $25,000 a student on the winning team, $5,000 for the coach and $5,000 for a designated school or library. About 2,000 teams of two or three students each and a coach are completing entries for the August deadline of what has become an international competition. 
 Further information about Thinkquest -- or the company's newest contest for younger students, Thinkquest Junior -- can be found at its Web site: www.advanced.org/thinkquest/. The site also has a library of contest submissions from previous years.
Mr. Weis, who has lived in various places in Westchester but now lives in Greenwich, worked for International Business Machines for 30 years before retiring and starting Advanced Network and Services. From 1990 through 1995 the nonprofit company helped build the Internet. In 1995 that part of the company's business was sold to America Online for what Mr. Weis says was "quite a bit of money." As a company dedicated to advancing education by accelerating the use of computer networking applications and technology, it looked for a way to spend the money appropriately.
Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Mr. Weis:
Q. Why did you start this contest?
A. We sat down several years ago and said, What do we want this company to do? We're fortunate enough to have quite a bit of money. We struggled with the question for a long time and came up with: we want to advance education through the use of computer networking technology and applications. Once we decided that, we asked, how will we get the greatest leverage to do that?
Q. What was wrong with what was out there in the way of educational software?
A. I took a look at what the power of Web and the Internet could really bring to education, and there wasn't a lot there. There wasn't a lot of content out on the Web that students and teachers could use in their everyday classroom for a variety of subjects. And the content that was out there -- most of it was built by adults with the mindset of adults rather than the mindset of a kid. Students think differently than adults. They play computer games. They explore. They learn through exploration. They learn through a combination of hand-eye coordination and doing things. And I wanted to get some of that thought and learning process into learning tools. And I thought there was no better way to do that than have the students do it.
I was also a little concerned that students from some of the better schools were moving faster than students that were lower on the informational technology ladder. So I wanted to see if we could couple students across schools on the informational technology ladder into teams so they could help each other, learn from each other. We decided to use a contest as the format to create a library -- and we have a wonderful legacy of what the students have done there, which is very heavily used worldwide.
Q. Are people other than contestants visiting your library of home pages?
A. Absolutely. Some days we have had almost two million hits. It's used regularly in the schools around the world. For example, if you want to learn the computer programming language C++, there is no better tool anywhere in the world than the page done by one of last year's winners. It's used by companies such as Lockheed. The Air Force Academy uses one of the entries to teach economics. Our pages are used all around the world not only in high schools but in industry to teach a variety of subjects.
These kids really have developed very good language tools. And there is another legacy in that the teachers who have acted as coaches have really been exposed to a whole new way of learning. And this is really good. All too often you read the bad things about the Internet. Very rarely do we see that this is a very powerful tool for students to use as a research tool, as a development tool, to give them the ability to sort of be more competitive in their lives in a dozen ways.
Q. How much does it cost your company to run these contests?
A. Take Thinkquest and Thinkquest Junior and that's about $1.5 million in scholarships and cash awards. But there are several additional million dollars behind it. We help teach the teachers so they're not afraid to bring the technology into their classrooms. We give out hundreds of thousands of CD-ROM's to schools all around the world that contain some of the entries and good software for development of entries. And we run the server, which is a very large job when you get so many hits a day. We spend on K-through-12 programs pretty close to $5 million a year.
Q. Your judging criteria include extra points for co-ed teams from different school districts, different countries, different ages. Why?
A. That's how we fine-tune the contest. We wanted more women to be involved, that's why we put the gender in. We wanted to encourage international teams. But we didn't want to encourage those things to the point of hurting the original goal of making sure there were high-quality educational tools. So we just give it little points for these things. Still the way you become a winner is you get every point. One of the teams last year that won first place in the Sports and Health category had a student from Virginia, another from Alaska and the third one from Russia.
Q. The judging must be so hard.
A. We use the Internet Society, and they do a spectacular job for us. They have hundreds of people who spend hundreds of hours on this. And many of them do it out of their heart, because they absolutely love being involved and love seeing what the students do. Each entry is looked at three times before it makes the semifinals and then a couple of times before it makes the finals. And then the judges sit with the students at the finals and talk to them for about an hour, going through their entry. They look at the codes the students have written and ask questions why they did it one way and not another way. The judges continue to be amazed by the students, and the students continue to be impressed with the judges.
Q. Have the judges been impressed with the depth of the topic or how the Web page was built?
A. The thing that impresses me the most about the winners is their imagination. They've really picked good topics, and they have good reasons to pick the good topics. For example, the students who did C++ said that was a language that was so important to learn and it wasn't being taught in schools. So they wanted to create a tool that was useful to other students.
And if you pick up a book and try to learn C++ the first thing you have to do is read the book, and then you may have to go out and get the software and install it on your computer. What they did was make it so if you have a computer you can get to their tool, and it will teach you and let you write a program and it will execute that program for you and see if it works. So it was really a brilliant implementation with great ideas and great motivation behind it. We've had other wonderful topics: the Himalayas, diseases, music. We have such a rich library of different subjects. It's really wonderful.
Q. What do you think participants get out of this contest?
A. I've talked to students who say, I can build a home page, and they build a home page and they say, Gee I want to make it look better, so they learn Java. And they say, I can't do everything I want with this, what I'm going to do is learn the programming language C, and then I'm going to learn this and I'm going to learn that and all of a sudden they've learned a lot about computer science, and they're interested in computer science. And they have something they can make a lot of money with during the summer. I think it has really helped bring a lot of students new jobs and maybe even a new outlook on life.
It has been the most rewarding program I've ever worked on in my life.

HEADLINE: Dance;
Dancer Alert: Pilobolus Holds an Open Audition

BYLINE: By TERRY TEACHOUT; Terry Teachout is the music critic of Commentary and a contributing writer for Time.

 BODY:
WEDNESDAY, MAY 27, 11:30 A.M.: Forty barefoot women are lined up along the dingy walls of City Center's fourth-floor rehearsal hall, waiting to improvise a 30-second dance that could change their lives. Some look alert, some nonchalant, a few terrified. All are here in response to a terse notice posted in a handful of New York dance studios and published in the trade press: Pilobolus Dance Theater is holding open auditions, starting today.
Between now and Friday, one of these women will crash through the blank wall of anonymity and win a place in one of the world's most popular modern-dance troupes. Not only will audiences across the country applaud her, but she will also earn a living wage, perhaps for the first time in her career as a professional dancer. 
 Most dancegoers know Pilobolus as a company famous for its wit and sensuality. These qualities will be on display in the three programs being presented during the group's annual monthlong season at the Joyce Theater, which opens Tuesday night with the New York premiere of "The Hand That Mocked, The Heart That Fed," a new dance featuring an original score by the noted jazz composer Maria Schneider. (Two other dances, "Apoplexy" and "Orangotango," will receive their New York premieres during the run.)
But professional dancers also know Pilobolus as one of the few modern-dance troupes that provides a regular paycheck, a rare commodity in a profession whose members regard unemployment benefits as an integral part of their skimpy incomes. Last season, the company's six dancers performed about 130 shows and were paid 45 weeks out of 52. That's one reason more than 200 people showed up today to compete for the jobs of Tamieca McCloud, Trebien Pollard and Mark Santillano, who are leaving at the end of the season to pursue their own projects.
Though the company's four artistic directors are in the enviable position of being able to take their pick of some of the best dancers in the business, they know their requirements are unusually idiosyncratic. Many otherwise talented dancers are baffled by Pilobolus's elusive style, a homegrown blend of gymnastics, modern dance and performance art; moreover, the company's dances are choreographed collaboratively, with the dancers playing a key role in the creative process. "We aren't looking for conventional dancers," says Jonathan Wolken, the executive director and one of the company's founders in 1971. Just as important, he adds, is the need to hire mature men and women who are capable of getting along during the many weeks they will spend together on the road. "It's a tightly knit family, and the emotional weather is very important," he says.
Over the years, Mr. Wolken, Robby Barnett, Michael Tracy and Alison Chase have devised a system that allows them to sift more or less efficiently through the large numbers of dancers their auditions invariably attract. In the first stage, the dancers learn a phrase, then perform it in groups of eight, after which they are allowed to improvise briefly on their own. "It's grueling," Mr. Wolken says, "but it's also fun to watch, a kind of human circus."
THURSDAY, 10:45 A.M.: Ten women and nine men were called back for the second day of auditions. Rebecca Anderson, a friendly faced blonde who is Pilobolus's dance captain, is concentrating on the women this morning. "I'm looking for somebody with some spark to her," she says. "And of course she has to be able to lift me, and I her. We had to cut some of the bigger women yesterday just for that reason." (Ms. Anderson is 5 feet 4 inches.)
Ms. Anderson and Ms. McCloud demonstrate a phrase from "Duet," an intricate exercise in female partnering. Then the women pair off and repeat it. "Watch the way they lift each other, and the way they're lifted," Mr. Wolken whispers. "Who's a sack of potatoes? Who's a part of a sculpture? Who's doing Rodin? Who's embarrassed?" A petite dancer with exotic features is singled out for special treatment, and as Ms. Anderson helps her polish the phrase, you can see the other women trying to decide whether their chances for success have gone up or down.
NOON: The directors and dancers huddle briefly and make the next cut. Then the six men and six women who are left are told how Pilobolus works. Members are expected to live near the company studio, in rural Connecticut; there are no understudies, so everybody must be willing to dance hurt; relationships with significant others are often strained by the lengthy touring schedule; some dances involve full or partial nudity. "You're going to be lonely, hurt, poor and naked," interjects Matt Kent, Pilobolus's class clown. Everybody laughs; nobody leaves.
FRIDAY, 10:30 A.M.: Ben Pring, one of the remaining male dancers, is taken to the back of the hall for a whispered conference while the other men continue to improvise. Michael Tracy and Robby Barnett offer him a job. "We think you'd be really good," says Mr. Tracy, "and I think you'd find this a good dance job." (He will accept over the weekend.)
11:45: Josie Coyoc, the elfin dancer who was singled out Thursday morning, has now emerged as one of the two front-runners among the women. An elegant performer whose demeanor is quiet and self-contained, she has spent the last five years with Bill T. Jones's company but is concerned about its financial stability. "I want to keep dancing," she says, "but I also want to be able to pay my bills -- I'm actually going into debt -- so I told Bill in February that I was going to have to look for something else. It was hard. But I love what Pilobolus does -- all the partnering, and the beautiful movements." Suddenly she starts to cry. "It's like leaving one family, perhaps to go to another."
12:15 P.M.: The other front-runner is Jennifer Binford, a tall, ebullient woman who makes fetchingly funny faces as she improvises. "This is the most creative audition I've ever had," she says excitedly. "I feel like I fit in, like I can be myself. I'm having a great time!" Then she sheepishly confesses that she hasn't slept for two days.
1 P.M.: One man and three women are sent home. Each is taken aside and gently given the bad news. "Dancers are always telling us: 'You treat us like humans; you actually talk to us!' " Mr. Tracy says after they leave. "Which gives us some idea of how things must work at other companies' auditions." He shudders.
3:30 P.M.: Another male dancer is sent home. The rest line up side by side as Mr. Wolken barks out a series of unlikely commands: "Look straight out. Relax your face. Now show us pure, unmitigated hatred . . . falling asleep . . . one drink too many . . . horrified . . . flabbergasted . . . you just walked through poison ivy . . . dignified!" The dancers dissolve in laughter, then sit down for more talk. "Do any of you keep a journal?," Mr. Wolken asks them. "What do you read?" The answers range from "One Hundred Years of Solitude" to "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People."
4:20 P.M.: The directors and company members excuse themselves and begin an intense, sometimes testy debate. Otis Cook, an extroverted improviser with a shaved head, is called over for a few more questions; the group then decides to offer him the second male slot, which he accepts at once. Choosing between Ms. Binford and Ms. Coyoc proves more difficult. "Rebecca was right when she said that it's basically going to be an esthetic decision," Mr. Barnett says. "Jennifer and Josie are both excellent dancers, they can do all the moves, but they're very different in size, appearance and character. So what do we want the company to look like? Where do we want to go as a group?" After 20 minutes of increasingly heated talk, a compromise is reached: the company will assemble in Connecticut next week to make a final decision, having had the weekend to think it over.
AFTERWARD: The members of Pilobolus reconvened the following Monday and voted unanimously to ask Ms. Coyoc to join them. "I needed a day to let it wash over me," she says a few weeks later. "Then I accepted." She speaks wistfully of telling her soon-to-be-former boss that she will be leaving his company: "I think Bill understood it was a choice I had to make, so I could continue to do what I love."
Ms. Coyoc, Mr. Cook and Mr. Pring will report to Connecticut on Aug. 10 for their first rehearsal. "I think we have a terrific looking new company," Mr. Barnett says. "We have a lot of faith in our audition process. It's not infallible, but it gives us an unusually good sense of who we're working with, and we've never had to let anyone go. On the basis of those three days, I think all of us are positive and enthusiastic about the year to come."

HEADLINE: A Steady Critical Eye on Film's Shifting Currents

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
SIXTEEN years into his marathon run as the film critic for The New Republic, Stanley Kauffmann sat down in 1974 to write an essay to answer the two questions he was most often asked: How many films do you see in a week? And don't you get bored?
Zero to 12 and no, Mr. Kauffmann answered in that essay, "Why I'm Not Bored." A film may be boring, but the idea of going never is. Boredom is incompatible with hope, Mr. Kauffmann wrote, and hope is more of a constant in film than in virtually any other art in America. 
 "No matter how much I know about a film's makers or its subject before I go, I never really know what it's going to do to me," he wrote. "Depress me with its vileness, or just roll past, or change my life in some degree, or some combination of all three, or affect me in some new way that I cannot imagine."
Twenty-four years later, Mr. Kauffmann is still at it. At age 82, he is celebrating his 40th anniversary at The New Republic this month, still trotting off to screenings and filing his literate, independent-minded, intelligent if not entertaining, very grown-up brand of reviews almost weekly.
A lot has happened in film during Mr. Kauffmann's time as a critic -- the advent of the French New Wave and the rise of the great Italian, Scandinavian and Japanese directors, the flourishing of American movie-making in the late 1960's and 1970's, the onset of the blockbuster, the dying of cinephilia.
Film criticism, too, has been transformed. Andrew Sarris imported the auteur theory from France. Pauline Kael emerged as the first critic-celebrity. Wars between critics broke out. Broadcast film reviewers entered the game and changed it. Now, in the "Armageddon" age, gloom engulfs the field.
Some critics, like David Denby of New York magazine, feeling drowned out by the din of the Hollywood marketing machine, seem despondent to a degree verging on despair. Column inches dwindle while movies multiply. Worthwhile films cannot get distributed. What can be worth saying, some critics wonder, about "Lethal Weapon 4"?
Yet Mr. Kauffmann carries on, seemingly unfazed, immune to both pessimism and hype. In an era of "blurb whores," his hyperbole-resistant style is rarely quoted in movie ads (a point of perverse pride for his editor). He remains afloat, buoyed by an old-fashioned commitment to the art, not the business, of film.
Not long ago he chose to review a film he figured almost no one would see: "Chronicle of a Disappearance," by a Palestinian director, Elia Suleiman. It appeared fleetingly in a small film museum in lower Manhattan. It reminded Mr. Kauffmann of Ionesco. He thought it was one of the best films in years.
"I thought, I'm derelict in my function if I don't record that that film passed through," he said in an interview in the penthouse apartment in lower Manhattan where he has lived with his wife, Laura, for 31 years. "Utility is not the only criterion. Otherwise, I'd be writing about 'Deep Impact.' "
"Highfalutin as it sounds, there's a point at which your obligation to the art must come into play, or else you're just a reporter," he said. (Then he added gently, apparently in deference to the delusions of the reporter in his living room, "Forgive me.")
Unlike many of today's film critics, who started young, Mr. Kauffmann began reviewing movies in middle age. Born and reared in Manhattan, he had majored in dramatic arts at New York University and had spent 10 years as an actor and stage manager with a repertory company that specialized in Shakespeare.
He had published extensively -- 40 one-act plays, 7 novels, articles for magazines. And he had worked as a book editor; he discovered and edited "The Moviegoer," by Walker Percy, while working at Knopf. In 1957, a friend moving out of the country handed over to Mr. Kauffmann an opportunity to write film reviews for a magazine called The Reporter. Thus Mr. Kauffmann became a film critic.
One day early on, he sent off a review to The New Republic. Two weeks later, a check and a copy of the magazine with his review in it arrived in the mail (followed, two days after that, by a letter from the editorial secretary: Thanks for the offer but we cannot use your review).
"I said, 'This is for me!' " Mr. Kauffmann recalled gleefully. Six months later, he was the magazine's regular film critic.
His timing was excellent. American movies were uninspired in those days, but European cinema in particular had entered a period of brilliance. Mr. Kauffmann became one of a handful of critics in the early 1960's who helped convince educated Americans that they could take film seriously as art again.
He especially admired the Italian directors. He championed Michael angelo Antonioni for "making a new art form." He called Federico Fellini "incapable of committing a stale or careless shot to film" and Vittorio De Sica "perhaps the outstanding example of the wedding of theatrical and cinematic mastery."
He also wrote about the likes of Akira Kurosawa in Japan and Satyajit Ray in India; he described Ingmar Bergman's films as ambitious, stimulating failures. "The Swedish director is now established as a Divine Amateur: enormously gifted, often technically dazzling, essentially undisciplined," Mr. Kauffmann wrote in 1959.
He mocked the French New Wave. In a review of Agnes Varda's "Cleo from 5 to 7," he parodied the New Wave style: "Use freakish faces for minor characters (this is candor). Use a little nudeness (this is maturity). Include long walks through a city, preferably Paris; just long, pointless walks."
After admiring "Breathless," he turned against Jean-Luc Godard's later films. He made fun of Godard's admirers (who happened to include Mr. Sarris and Ms. Kael), calling Godard "a magician who makes elaborate uninspired gestures and then pulls out of the hat precisely nothing."
Mr. Kauffmann's strengths as a critic are said by both admirers and detractors to consist of a literate, cultivated approach; a deep knowledge of theater and strong feeling for acting; an economical writing style, and a refusal to conform to anyone else's doctrine.
He never subscribed to the auteur theory promoted by Mr. Sarris, who many now credit with changing the way Americans think about film, emphasizing the role of the director above all. (Mr. Kauffmann nevertheless says he learned from it.) Nor did he ever admire film as popular culture, as opposed to art, to the extent that Ms. Kael and her followers did.
GREG TAYLOR, who teaches film studies at Purchase College, SUNY and is writing a book on postwar film criticism, calls Mr. Kauffmann "one of a group of stalwarts whose heyday was the 60's" and who concerned themselves with the esthetics of film.
"Their work was not strictly directed at highbrows but at a broader middlebrow audience," Mr. Taylor said, listing Dwight Macdonald and John Simon among the group. "And they really explicitly tried to educate and elevate taste in movies."
Which they and others did. By the late 1960's, American movie making had begun to change. Beginning around the time of "Bonnie and Clyde," in 1967, a group of artistically ambitious directors like Francis Ford Coppola, Robert Altman, Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma began making movies that not only were profoundly popular and entertaining but were also widely seen as more stylish and complex than what had come before.
The climate of filmgoing had changed, too. Richard T. Jameson, the editor of Film Comment, calls the period "an era of enlightened filmgoership." Americans were eager to read in depth about film. Critics became important cultural figures, speaking on college campuses, their work widely discussed.
Bloody feuds broke out in print. Ms. Kael took on Mr. Sarris and the auteur theory; there were viciously argued differences over New Wave directors like Godard. Later, John Simon attacked Ms. Kael and Mr. Sarris. Mr. Sarris, given an opportunity to respond in the pages of The New York Times, fought back, calling Mr. Simon "the Count Dracula of critics."
Ms. Kael also took occasional swipes at Mr. Kauffmann ("the UnKael," as Louis Menand called him in a 1995 article about Ms. Kael in The New York Review of Books). In reviews of films like Truffaut's "Jules and Jim," she would quote Mr. Kauffmann's opinions, then witheringly dismiss them.
(When asked recently about each other, neither Mr. Kauffmann nor Ms. Kael would comment. "I think I'd rather not," Ms. Kael said. Looking suddenly distraught, the avuncular Mr. Kauffmann said: "I don't want to go into it. It's the sort of thing I disliked so much in the 1960's.")
Out of that period Ms. Kael emerged as the dominant critic, arguing that many American movies of the 70's were art as much as or more than those of the European model that audiences had been taught to respect. As Peter Rainer, the film critic for New Times Los Angeles, puts it, there was value in the subversiveness of those American movies, "not just to thrill us but to take us to a higher plane."
Mr. Kauffmann, by contrast, was less than swept away. He was unimpressed by "The Godfather" and "The Godfather Part II." He compared "Nashville" to "a superior book-club novel." If "Chinatown" were shorter and less paradigmatic, he wrote in 1974, "it would be a good sinister thriller."
The late 1970's and 80's brought another revolution, this time in movie marketing, with the rise of saturation distribution and a growing reliance by studios on television publicity. That, in turn, transformed the experience of being a critic, not to mention the movies themselves.
The industry needed blockbusters that could open in thousands of theaters at once. Studios turned increasingly to television talk shows and other venues to promote them. These days, by the time a movie opens and a print critic weighs in, the studios have already been spreading the word for months.
Most critics feel that good movies are still being made but that it's harder for the films to get the public's attention. Foreign and independent films disappear for lack of publicity or distribution. To write only about small masterpieces that few readers will see strikes some critics as courting irrelevance.
"If you're talking about movies as an art, you're just out of it," complained Mr. Denby, who recently wrote an article in The New Yorker bemoaning the dying of the film culture. "The business conversation is the hip conversation, the knowing conversation, the dinner-table conversation."
Some critics have changed their focus. J. Hoberman, the senior critic for The Village Voice, said that he had started out in film criticism much more interested in the esthetics of film but that like others, he had shifted his attention to the sociological, political and historical implications of movies.
But that approach, too, had its drawbacks, said Mr. Rainer, who had tried it. "It's just that if that's the only way that you can really sink your teeth into movies time and time again, you become famished," he said. "Because so much of what brought us into movies as budding critics was the wonderfulness of movies, not the social context."
Mr. Kauffmann, meanwhile, has no plans to retire. (He stopped just once, in the late 1960's, to spend eight months as the theater critic for The New York Times.) Some fellow critics say his tastes have grown stuffier over the years. Mr. Jameson, the editor of Film Comment, said Mr. Kauffmann represented "comparatively speaking, a kind of fuddy-duddyism." But Roger Ebert calls him the best critic working, the only one who makes Mr. Ebert reconsider his own view.
And Jon Wilkman, a 55-year-old documentary filmmaker in Los Angeles who first read Mr. Kauffmann in the early 1960's at Oberlin College, credits Mr. Kauffmann with inspiring Mr. Wilkman's own filmmaking, in part by introducing him to the work of the Italian neo-realist director Ermanno Olmi.
"I will go to a movie knowing nothing except that Stanley liked it," said Mr. Wilkman, who has never met Mr. Kauffmann. "I would say to my wife, 'Stanley likes this, we should go.' And she would laugh at me for my excessive dependence."

Tours to Indonesia Postponed for Many

 BODY:
Although the violence has subsided in Indonesia, the political and economic situation remains unsettled, and the State Department, in a June 11 public announcement, advises Americans to avoid crowds and areas where violence has been reported. The announcement replaced a June 3 travel warning urging Americans to defer non-essential travel to the country.
While Jakarta, Indonesia's capital and the site of most demonstrations against former President Suharto -- who resigned May 21 -- is not included on most group-tour itineraries, many tour companies are rescheduling or canceling their tours to other sections of the country. For example, Volcano Tours canceled its Indonesian trips scheduled for June and August, with full refunds. Overseas Adventure Travel also canceled its trips to Indonesia for the rest of the year, with a full refund plus $200 toward any other trip during 1998. 
 Bali has not experienced violence, although there have been some demonstrations on the island. Spice Island Cruises, which offers trips that originate in Bali and then travel to remote islands, has not had any cancellations or drop in bookings, according to Jill Potash, a spokeswoman, and sees no reason not to conduct business as usual, far removed from the disturbances.
Journeys Off the Tourist Track in Fairfax, Calif., canceled one trip to Bali for June, but still plans to take two groups there in August. Travelers booked on a trip to Indonesia through Asia Transpacific Journeys in Boulder, Colo., have been given the option to reschedule. One tour set to depart the weekend after the disturbances in Jakarta was canceled, and refunds were offered. Since then, the company reports almost no cancellations, but its bookings to Indonesia have been lower than usual this year, it said.
Updated information on Indonesia is available from the United States Embassy in Jakarta, www.usembassyjakarta.org. Call (202) 647-5225 for recorded travel information on any country. Consular Information Sheets for all countries can be accessed through the State Department's Internet site, travel.state.gov.

HEADLINE: OUT OF ORDER;
Taking a Potshot at the Game of Golf

BYLINE: By DAVID BOUCHIER; David Bouchier is an essayist and commentator on public radio.

 BODY:
THE game of golf has always been a great mystery to me. But it's time to learn. Golf is becoming the only industry on eastern Long Island. All residents of Suffolk County will soon be required to play at least one round a day, just to keep the economy afloat.
Every day, it seems, farms and farmhouses vanish like Brigadoon, to be replaced by these strange alien landscapes. Instead of fields and crops, the landscape sprouts artificial lakes, tiny sandy deserts and vast stretches of improbably green grass. Even in the most unpromising weather, people can be seen creeping through these bleak open spaces in electric carts or striking with sticks at balls that, from any appreciable distance, are invisible. 
 It looks about as much fun as a root canal. Yet clearly golf is one of those games that seizes on its victims with the force of an addiction. I've been to some all-male luncheons where my companions could talk about nothing else. They relentlessly share their thoughts on clubs and balls, considerations on the subtle differences (invisible to the untrained eye) between one golf course and another, arcane knowledge about tournaments, scores and the weather at St. Andrews, Scotland.
Even fully employed men with families and mortgages seem to think nothing of flying to Florida or Arizona in winter, so they can keep batting those little white balls around without losing them in the snow. Just as the hippies of the 1960's rebelled against work so that they could pursue peace and love, so the businessmen of the 1990's seem to have given up work in favor of golf.
As golf is obviously in my future, I turned my mind to unraveling its mysteries. Clearly there is more to this pastime than meets the untutored eye. As I'm sure others have realized, golf is a metaphor for life. It's a competitive activity, played in pursuit of a dream called beating "par," the ideal score. Golf divides the game of life into 18 more or less equal stages; let's assume that each stage, or hole, represents four years. The hole is your life goal for that period. The clubs represent the different choices you must make in order to get there. The little round, hard object that you try to push along and occasionally lose is yourself. The water and sand traps stand for the hazards of life. And your handicap is, well, your handicap. One of the most refreshing things about golfers is the way they talk so frankly about their handicaps, without whining or expecting to be pitied as victims.
The metaphor of golf and life is almost without limits. You have to wait your turn to play, and if you happen to be stuck behind a really large group -- the 70 million baby boomers, for example -- you can wait forever to get your shot. There are long stretches of tedium between brief moments of excitement, and your score at the end is never what you hoped it would be at the beginning.
When you reach the final hole, you move on to the 19th, which presumably represents paradise, or retirement to one of those golfing communities down South.
However, like most metaphors, this one is not perfect. Life is not actually divided into 18 equal stages; the hazards are not predictable; the playing surface is never smooth. And this set me thinking about my own golfing experience, which happened a long time in the past.
Every summer my family would go to a seaside resort for our vacation. And because it rained most of the time, we found artificial amusements. One of these was miniature golf. If you want a true metaphor for life, miniature golf is much closer to the mark. That's what life is really like: over the bridge, through the elephant's trunk, round the corkscrew, down the funnel of the steam engine and into the bottomless pit; never a nice clean drive down an empty fairway. Instead of being off to the side, the hazards are piled up directly in your path, just as they are in real life. You get only one club, and it's a putter, not a driver. There is no such thing as par for the course.
Miniature golf is definitely my kind of game.

HEADLINE: State of Commuting: Stalled and Getting Worse

BYLINE: By PEGGY McCARTHY 

 BODY:
MARK MEYER spent so much time stuck in traffic when he commuted from Milford to Port Chester, N.Y., that he took the opportunity to learn a new language. Stuck on the Connecticut Turnpike, he listened to language tapes, studied a textbook and became quite fluent in Italian. And he always had time left over to read the morning newspaper as well.
But Mr. Meyer never mastered commuting. It made him so miserable, he said, it was a major reason that he left his job for one where he works mainly out of his home. 
 On the Merritt Parkway, Mark S. Graham has gotten to know other commuters -- at least by their faces and cars. On his daily 17-mile trip from Trumbull to Westport, he said, they are all "stuck in the same moving parking lot." It can get "a little surreal," he said. For instance, he might be laughing at a joke told by radio host Howard Stern, and the driver sitting in the car next to him is laughing at the same time. They give each other a look. Same program?
But when Mr. Graham, a marketing executive, needs to get to a meeting and he's stuck in traffic, he isn't laughing.
Traffic in southern Connecticut is a concern of business leaders, state transportation officials, politicians and environmentalists, as well as the people stuck in it. "It's getting worse, not better, and people can see that," said Matthew Nemerson, president of the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce. It is a factor that businesses and individuals consider when deciding whether to locate or stay in an area, where to take vacations and when to plan meetings, he said.
"Some people won't go to Stamford before 10 o'clock and after 2 o'clock," said Mr. Nemerson. "It can't be good for the fastest-growing area of the state to be temporarily redlined." So, state officials are trying to get at least a portion of the cars off the Greenwich-to-New Haven stretch -- the Connecticut Turnpike (I-95), the Merritt and Wilbur Cross Parkways (Route 15), and U.S. 1 (Post Road).
The state is not spending new money to do so, though. There won't be massive road projects to add highway lanes or build new roads. Instead, $58.4 million in existing state and Federal transportation funds is being reallocated over seven years, explained Stuart D. Leland, director of inventory and forecasting in the State Department of Transportation. The goal is a 5 percent reduction, some 8,600 cars, from than 1997 levels. And, Mr. Leland said, "it's 5 percent plus the growth that would occur. That's more like a 12 percent total."
The plan relies on a combination of tactics: encouraging more intrastate train riders by increasing railroad parking spaces, improving train schedules and bus service, coordinating train and bus schedules, and counting on voluntary actions by employers, such as instituting flexible schedules so that people can travel to work in off-peak periods. Commuters like Mr. Meyer and Mr. Graham expressed doubt that all this would make a noticeable difference. But business leaders involved in forming the plan are optimistic.
Mr. Nemerson said "when you look at the huge difference a little rubbernecking can make, or how a busy entrance ramp can slow down traffic for miles, you understand the power of taking off a few cars."
Joseph McGee, vice president for public policy for the Southwest Area Commerce and Industry Association, said that on holidays when many businesses close, peak-hours traffic drops about 5 percent and "traffic flows freely."
Mr. Leland of the Department of Transportation said that "it will make a difference," but that "I don't know how big a difference."
He said that exorbitant costs and interest in retaining the character of the Merritt Parkway eliminated the option of expanding roads.
"If you were to add another lane to 95, you're talking billions. So that's out of the question," he said.
The 5 percent goal was established because it was considered to be realistic and attainable, said Harry P. Harris, the state deputy commissioner for public transportation.
"If you were going to set the figure at much higher, you would have an even bigger hurdle to overcome," he said.
Mr.McGee said that said studies have shown that traffic in the area increases by about 1.5 percent a year.
The railroad portion of the plan is designed to get 1,750 more people to commute by train, already the predominant mode of transit used by commuters to New York City.
Now, the emphasis will be on luring intrastate commuters, particularly to Stamford, "the biggest destination outside of Grand Central Station," Mr. Harris said.
Train travel has to be seen as a convenient, cost-effective alternative, and since most railroad parking lots are already filled, more riders can not be attracted without additional parking, Mr. Harris said. Parking garages for 1,200 cars each are being planned in Stamford and New Haven.
New free parking, additional trains, and lower rates are in the works for Bridgeport to encourage more commuters to travel from there, Mr. Harris said. A 750-car parking lot between the railroad station and the new HarborYard baseball stadium is due to open around Labor Day and will provide free parking for five years for people with weekly or monthly rail commutation tickets. The fenced lot will have 24-hour security guards as well as closed circuit TV surveillance.
Starting Aug. 24, two new trains will originate in Bridgeport with limited stops to Grand Central Terminal.
One train will start at 6:34 A.M., with stops in South Norwalk, Rowayton, Darien, Noroton Heights and Stamford and will arrive at Grand Central at 7:54.
A 7:01 A.M. train, with stops in Fairfield, Southport, Greens Farms, Westport and East Norwalk, will arrive at Grand Central at 8:26 A.M.
Fares are being reduced to narrow the gap between Bridgeport and Fairfield rates, Mr. Harris said. For example, monthly commutation tickets from Bridgeport will drop from $283 to $271. The Fairfield monthly rate is $254.
"By lowering fares and eliminating parking fees, it will be cheaper to take the train from Bridgeport than from Faifield," Mr. Harris said.
An additional 1,500 parking garage is part of a planned Federally-funded transportation center for Bridgeport.
Mr. Harris said there is a focus on Bridgeport because there is a 1,700-person waiting list for parking in neighboring Fairfield, and a proposed two-deck parking garage for Fairfield is facing opposition from town residents.
Parking expansion for about 60 more cars is planned for Milford, and planned expansion for 55 cars at Talmadge Hill in New Canaan has received local opposition, he said.
Meanwhile, officials in West Haven, the only town on the shore between New Haven and Greenwich where Metro-North trains do not stop, have asked the D.O.T. to build a railroad station and adjacent parking lot in that city, he said.
He said people have to be convinced that it's more economical to use public transportation by comparing the total cost of using a car every day in terms of wear and tear and maintenance, not by just looking at the price of gasoline versus the cost of a train ticket and railroad station parking.
Gov. John G. Rowland has enthusiastically endorsed the plan, something of a departure from his position last year when he proposed eliminating three rail lines in the state: the Danbury, Shoreline East, and Waterbury branch lines. (The General Assembly rejected his proposal.)
The most unpredictable part of the plan is the voluntary element that relies on businesses to encourage employees to take public transportation, join car and van pools, work different schedules, and do some telecommuting, Mr. Leland said. One carrot for taking action is a Federal tax break for companies that provide free parking for car poolers and subsidies for rail or bus users.
Some businesses are already taking steps. For instance, Mr. Graham, a partner in Gray & Graham, a Westport marketing firm, permits employees from the Naugatuck Valley to avoid the congestion by arriving at work earlier and leaving earlier.
Of the entire plan, Mr. Nemerson, of the New Haven Chamber, has his fingers crossed. "We just have to hope that it works because we really have to have it successful in order to convince companies that southern Connecticut is going to offer them an attractive environment in five or 10 years for their workers," he said.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Building Boom Unleashes a Conservation Backlash

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
DEVELOPMENT stoked by a robust economy has arrived at many Connecticut towns unaccustomed to large-scale home construction.
In the process, it has created a backlash of local land conservation initiatives that are spreading in numbers and intensity through upper Fairfield, lower Litchfield and New Haven Counties, manifesting itself particularly in six communities. 
 Woodbury, for example, is awaiting a decision from its owner on the sale of the 685-acre Flanders Nature Center to a Waterbury software company or to the nature center itself, which has been leasing it.
Shelton and North Branford have adopted ordinances permitting the two towns to buy development rights from local farmers and forest land owners to preserve open space.
In Guilford, the local land trust is seeking to purchase a section of the Trap Rock Ridge area to prevent the development of a housing subdivision and Sherman is pondering ways to offset the loss of a 289-acre farm to a real-estate developer.
In Wallingford, developers protested the Town Council's decision in April to purchase by condemnation 100 acres under contract for residential development. A suit by one developer charges that the decision was made to protect the homes of the Mayor and two town council members whose homes abut the sites.
In April, the Town Council voted to buy two tracts of residentially zoned land totaling 100 acres for $4.5 million, claiming them for open space and, possibly, a golf course. But last Tuesday, under pressure, the Council rescinded that vote.
Last month 3,000 signatures, 500 more than required, were gathered on a petition for a referendum on the appropriation. "I don't like the idea of the town taking property by eminent domain," said Frank Ciccone, a local resident who spearheaded the petition drive. "Nor do I like spending that much money for no specific purpose."
Sixty of the acres involved had been approved last November for construction of 79 homes. Since then, the developer, Steven Temkin, head of the T & M Building Company of Torrington, has built a road into the property and poured four foundations, and is completing two houses as models.
"We opened on June 14 and took six deposits," he said, "returnable if the land is taken by the town."
The remaining 40 acres across town have been optioned by Richard Fiske, president of the Ravenswood Development Corporation in Cheshire. He expects to build 38 houses adjacent to a 131-home subdivision that he has completed. He filed suit on June 3 in Superior Court in Meriden against the town, saying that "the true purpose of taking the land is not conservation but to stop development for an improper motive."
While they were not named in the suit, Mayor William W. Dickinson and Ray Rys Sr. and Richard Centner, Town Council members, were accused by some residents at public hearings of attempting to protect their own homes by taking the adjacent properties for open space.
Mr. Fiske said he was not dropping his suit until he is convinced that the town will not try to condemn his optioned property alone.
"A lot of this comes down to what the town will look like in 30 years," Mayor Dickinson said before last Tuesday's meeting. Explaining the Council's choice of land, he said:
"Our Conservation Commission reviewed all suitable pieces in town and provided us with a list of worthwhile properties. We found no one was willing to sell. None of those properties abuts mine -- one Councilman may be in that position. I'm not sure there is a lot of substance to those charges."
IN Sherman, the Trust for Public Lands and Sherman's Naromi Land Trust have pressed the Justice Department to sell them the Carlson Farm since 1994, when the Federal Government seized the property as part of the assets of the defunct Bank for Credit and Commerce International.
"It is unusual for the Justice Department to be involved in land sales, but this was a takeover resulting from a bank scandal and had to follow the Government's bidding procedure," said Valerie Talmage, director of projects at the Trust for Public Lands' regional office in Boston.
Bids were accepted and made public early this year, among them one from the trust on behalf of Sherman and another from the 890 Realty Company of Ridgefield. The Justice Department gave the trust an opportunity to submit a counteroffer, but, within its authority, would not disclose the realty company's high bid.
Sherman lost the property to 890 Realty Company, whose bid was $100,000 more than the trust's $2.5 million offer.
According to Donna Tuck, First Selectman of Sherman, the sale will not be final until $2.6 million is paid by the end of July. Meanwhile, the town hopes to minimize development through its zoning regulations. The developer, she said, "is talking golf course and a limited number of high-end homes; that's better than 80 houses."
Along Guilford's section of Connecticut's Trap Rock Ridges lies a rugged wilderness called Bluff Head, the site of a proposed 18-lot subdivision on 80 acres just south of the Durham line. Durham is concerned that a new road required to connect the site with Route 77 will generate a flood of commuter traffic.
Red Erter, president of the Guilford Land Trust, said the trust was "partnering with the town" to buy the parcel. The subdivision application by Walter Nichols of Orange and David Chase of Manhattan is pending before the Planning and Zoning Commission. It has also been submitted for advisory review to the Durham Planning and Zoning Commission and the Midstate Regional Planning Agency.
"We have land-acquisition funds," said George Kral, Guilford's Town Planner, "and this is part of an open-space corridor planned for many years."
In Shelton, a Farmlands and Forest Preservation Act has been adopted through which landowners may sell development rights to the city in return for payment based on a formula adjusted for each site. They also get a reduction in property taxes, but the land can never be sold for development.
Terry Jones, owner of the Jones Tree Farm in Shelton and co-chairman of the city's Conservation Commission, helped craft the ordinance. He has put 92 of his 400 acres into the program. After agreeing to take $1 million less than the appraised price, he received $300,000 from the city and $800,000 from the state.
Mr. Jones urged other landowners to join the program and wherever possible make similar concessions. "Our goal," he said, "is to preserve at least 1,500 acres of forest and farm land."
Under the city's agreement with the state and Federal governments, the Federal Department of Agriculture will reimburse the state for $400,000 of the Jones payment. The money must go into a fund for buying more development rights.
"The state only has X number of dollars for its own development-rights program," said Rick Schultz, Shelton's Planning and Zoning Administrator. "Many farms go after the money -- it's very competitive. We are ahead of the game because we have a funding source in place."
The city's annual contribution is $100,000 and there are additional payments from developers of subdivisions, who are required to set aside 10 percent of the land for open space or contribute its value in cash.
The program has also been adopted in North Branford.
THE Flanders Nature Center in Woodbury, part of a 1,300-acre wildlife sanctuary, has been leased from the Whittemore family trust for 30 years, providing hiking trails, educational programs and resources for plant and animal research. "When I die," said Robert Whittemore, 77, "the trust ends, and the property would go undivided to family members, which is an extremely undesirable way to handle real estate. It makes more sense to see that it goes into good hands while the trust is still in existence. I would like to see it remain as much as possible undeveloped forest land."
Arthur Milnor, executive director of the Flanders Nature Center, is contacting individuals, foundations, corporations and the state to support the center's offer to buy the 685 acres. A second offer has been submitted by John Haested, president of Haested Methods of Waterbury, a software company. "They are not too far apart, and in the general area of the asking price," said Mr. Whittemore, who is in no hurry to make a decision.
"I want to do awesome things that Flanders should be doing, but isn't," Mr. Haested said. He outlined a plan for a 30,000-square-foot building containing his business, plus a day-care center, tennis courts and homes for himself and his two top employees. His staff of approximately 100 would live elsewhere.
"It would all look like it was built in 1860," he said, "confined to about 200 acres." Walking and jogging trails would be open to the public, and the rest of the land, he indicated, "would be donated to a trust that we might form."
"If we went for this clean industry," said Peter Hughes, Woodbury Town Planner, "a zone change would be needed." Mr. Haested has not initiated any action, just describing his plans briefly. First Selectman Richard Crane, who is on vacation and unavailable for comment, has said in local newspaper reports that he feels the Haested company is noninvasive and that the Selectmen are interested in increasing the town's tax base.
In just the last six months, resistance to development of Connecticut's remaining open space has stiffened markedly. The resistance was triggered, said Mr. Kral, Guilford's Town Planner, by a sudden awakening to a surge of construction following a depressed housing market that ended about 18 months ago.
In commenting on the loss of the Sherman property, Ms. Talmage of the Trust for Public Land said: "There are pieces of land that people thought would always be preserved, central to the character of New England towns. All of a sudden, these pieces are being proposed for housing and golf courses."

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Waiving Contract Clauses

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
IT is hardly news that the real estate market in the New York City area is about as hot as it has been in quite a while. And since the heat seems to be generated by the friction from buyers bumping into one another chasing sellers, there has hardly been a more appropriate time to apply the first rule of the open market: "Let the buyer beware."
"People do strange things when they're under pressure," said William Selsberg, a real estate lawyer in Stamford, Conn., noting that buyers who are anxious about losing the house of their dreams had a tendency to become careless with what might be the most significant investment of a lifetime. "And if you're careless, you're probably going to get kicked." 
 For example, Mr. Selsberg said, some clients have suggested in recent months that they would be willing to waive one or more of the common contingencies inserted into a contract of sale -- things like home inspections, and requirements that a mortgage must be obtained and that an existing home must be sold before the buyer is required to complete the purchase.
"I tell them that waiving things like that can end up costing them a fortune," Mr. Selsberg said.
Waiving a home-sale contingency, for example, might seem safe when a person buying a new home already has a signed contract to sell the current one. Many people reason, Mr. Selsberg said, that if the sale of their existing home falls through, they will be able to safely exit from the contract for the purchase of the new one because mortgage commitments themselves are generally contingent upon the sale of an existing home.
But that is not necessarily the case, Mr. Selsberg said, because it can be argued quite convincingly that the mortgage contingency clause in the buyer's contract to purchase the new home was fully satisfied when the mortgage commitment was issued, even though the commitment was contingent upon the sale of the buyer's existing home.
"That contingency is between the buyer and his lender," Mr. Selsberg said. "As far as the seller is concerned, the mortgage contingency has been met and the buyer has to go through with the deal or lose his deposit."
As a result, Mr. Selsberg said, he has a stock answer for clients who suggest waiving a standard contingency: "Don't you dare do that," he tells them. "You can never skip a step."
In fact, one of the more common steps that buyers seem willing to skip is the home inspection. And that can have costly consequences.
"People think that if they insist on a home inspection, someone will come and steal the house out from under them," said Maryann Murphy, director of Housemaster, a nationwide home inspection company based in Bound Brook, N.J. But an inspection by a qualified inspector, Ms. Murphy said, can uncover problems that even knowledgeable buyers might miss, things like water seepage, the presence of asbestos, radon gas or lead paint or a leaking underground oil storage tank.
And while such problems cost a buyer money only when they are successful in purchasing the house, there are some risks that can occur when they are unsuccessful.
As the number of available apartments decreases, particularly in Manhattan, "the waiving of mortgage contingencies by apartment buyers has suddenly emerged as a widespread practice in New York City," said Gordon Shanks, managing director of Home Mortgage Acceptance Corporation, a Manhattan-based mortgage broker. "They know that if they don't win the bidding the first time, it might be months before they find another apartment."
But waiving the mortgage contingency is generally considered risky because the deposit can be lost if a mortgage cannot be obtained and the buyer can't go through with the deal. But it is possible to eliminate that risk, Mr. Shanks said, if a buyer can get a mortgage commitment before entering into a contract of sale.
"These buyers apply for a mortgage and get a commitment letter before they actually find the apartment they want to buy," Mr. Shanks said. "When they find an apartment, they can bid on it immediately and waive the mortgage contingency."
Neil Bader, president of Skyscraper Mortgage in Manhattan, said that while a buyer with a commitment in hand might safely waive a mortgage contingency, those who have only been "prequalified" or "pre-approved" should proceed with caution.
Prequalification, Mr. Bader said, is merely an indication that a lender is likely to grant a mortgage. That, however, is based only upon the information provided by the prospective borrower. Generally, he said, prequalifications do not take into consideration significant factors like credit history, employment history, and the special scrutiny given to income generated by self-employment.
"Prequalification certainly isn't enough for a buyer to safely waive a mortgage contingency," Mr. Bader said.
Pre-approval, on the other hand, does provide some measure of assurance because most factors are accounted for. But the problem with pre-approval is that it doesn't take into consideration one factor of great significance to a lender -- the appraised value of the property.
"If the appraisal comes in too low, the mortgage will probably not be approved," said Mr. Bader, noting that the buyer would be paying more than the lender believed the property was worth. And that, he said, can result in the loss of the buyer's deposit if there is no mortgage contingency clause to provide an escape route.
Diane Saatchi, an agent with Dayton-Halstead Real Estate in East Hampton, L.I., said that property owners there were addressing that issue by agreeing to share the risk.
"Buyers are waiving the mortgage contingency only if sellers will guarantee the appraisal value," said Ms. Saatchi. "If the appraisal comes in too low, the buyer's lack of a mortgage contingency doesn't matter because the seller's guarantee gives him another out."
But how likely is a low appraisal?
"Very likely," said Peter Bell, chief executive of Balch Buyers Realty, an exclusive buyer-broker in Mamaroneck, N.Y. "There's such tremendous competition for listings now that if a seller wants to list his house for $50,000 more than it's worth, a broker might take the listing anyway because he knows that if he doesn't take it, another broker will."
And that, Mr. Bell said, coupled with low interest rates, high salaries, dual incomes and generous bonuses can result in purchase prices being driven upward by what buyers can afford to pay today, rather than what the real value of the property would be in a less robust economy.
Eric Davis, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, agreed.
"In the late 80's, people buying real estate believed that the good times would last forever and that the market would never stop expanding," he said. "But the market contracted, and people lost their jobs or had to move, and some of them couldn't even sell their apartments for the outstanding balance on their mortgage."
As a result, Mr. Davis said, buyers whose dream home is appraised for less than what they are about to pay for it should take a deep breath and contemplate whether the low appraisal is a blessing in disguise.
"When you get intoxicated with a particular piece of real estate, you tend to make decisions that are emotional rather than reasonable," he said. "And buying real estate should always be a function of sobriety."

HEADLINE: To Lead A Community

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: MORRISTOWN

 BODY:
LUIS A. PEREZ drove his 1989 Honda Accord through the high iron gate of Drumthwacket in Princeton this month and felt disbelief and exhilaration as he took in the expansive lawn with sycamore, linden and beech trees leading up to the 19th-century Greek Revival mansion that serves as the Governor's official residence.
"I'm somebody from the ghetto, and to go to a place like this was beautiful," said Mr. Perez, one of 35 people who graduated that night from a program that teaches leaders from urban neighborhoods how to develop their skills further to help those neighborhoods. 
 "My wife and I were looking at each other," he recalled, "like, 'How far I've come!' "
Mr. Perez, 41, and his wife had driven from Union City, where they live with their 16-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter. But the real distance he was talking about was a different kind, one along a hard road to survival and salvation from a troubled past in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, where he was a heroin addict and a member of a gang called the Puerto Rican Henchmen.
Now he was here, the leader of an organization in Union City that tries to save troubled young people much like his younger self, about to receive a certificate for completing the eight-month program called the Neighborhood Leadership Initiative, sponsored by the Community Foundation of New Jersey.
The foundation, a statewide organization that supports community involvement to promote neighborhood development, created the initiative in 1992 under Christine Todd Whitman, who was the foundation's president at the time. The state Department of Community Affairs was instrumental in setting it up and has been a strong supporter ever since.
The graduates, or fellows, as they are called, who were honored on June 5 numbered 27 women and 8 men, a diverse group from around that state that included four ministers, a school board member, a tenant liaison for a nonprofit housing corporation, the director of social services for a community action program, the president of a block watch group and an information project manager for AT&T.
With their graduation, the Neighborhood Leadership Initiative has returned 250 people to their communities with grants of up to $5,000 and a better knowledge of how to use the assets of those communities to improve the quality of life there, create concrete workable programs and obtain the money to support them.
As the evening came to a close, the fellows were asked to talk about explain their feelings about going back into the community.
"We are soldiers learning to tap into the government and private sector for resources in order to fight our battles in the war on drugs, poverty and the exploitation of our communities," Mr. Perez said.
"I have grown from a soldier to a general," he added, "ready to declare war on anything that will destroy the fabric of my community."
 
Lessons in Turning Dreams Into Reality
From a fading 17-room Tudor Revival mansion dating to 1916 that is leased from the Morris County Park Commission, the Community Foundation of New Jersey quietly goes about collecting money from individuals, corporations and private foundations for projects throughout the state. Two former governors, Thomas H. Kean and Jim Florio, have served on its advisory board.
James C. Kellogg, the current president, said the idea for a neighborhood leadership initiative grew out of discussions between Mrs. Whitman, when she was president, and Sheila Campbell Williamson, a founder of the foundation in 1980 and its longtime executive director until her death in 1994. Melvin R. Primus Jr., a Camden mayor who was Community Affairs Commissioner in the Florio administration at the time, joined them in the planning, Mr. Kellogg said.
Ira Resnick, the foundation's chief program officer, said of the philosophy behind the initiative, "The idea was to identify emerging leadership in a number of diverse neighborhoods and provide training at a statewide level, mentoring and peer support, and then give the people grants of about $3,000 to $5,000 to initiate community projects."
The current Commissioner of Community Affairs, Jane M. Kenny, was a vice president for corporate and community affairs at Beneficial Management Corporation in Peapack at the time and was asked to work on the program committee for the initiative.
"We wanted to get at the community activist who didn't have access to those programs that maybe a corporation person would have, or a government official," she said. "We knew there were people out there who were frustrated and didn't know where to go and how to make changes."
She added, "What we were trying to do was teach them how to become an advocate for their community rather than an irritant whom no one would listen to, how to a point across and turn it into change."
The program adopted by the Neighborhood Leadership Initiative begins with an overnight retreat in October, continues with one full Saturday each month at locations around the state, and ends with a graduation at Drumthwacket in June that Mr. Kellogg describes as more "exuberant and festive" than most.
"I was introduced as Mr. Corn Flakes by one graduate, who claimed it was a slip of the tongue," he said good-naturedly.
The first night at the retreat, the fellows make charts identifying the four events in their lives that have had the greatest impact on their identity. They are also asked to determine what effect, if any, the events had on their wanting to be leaders.
The next day, they take part in physical tests that call on teamwork, trust and problem-solving skills. One exercise requires 10 people to stand on two logs and lift ropes in unison to "walk" the logs across a field.
"You can really see the personalities working," said Faith A. Krueger, the foundation's chief administrative officer. "Someone's a take-charge person, and you have another take-charge person. All of a sudden they have to learn to say, 'Listen, we both can lead a group, but we need to work together on this or we're never going to get across that football field.' "
Their all-day classes once a month take the students to different sites around New Jersey. This year's sites included the Summit Bank in Jamesburg, the New Visions Community Center in Trenton, and the Delaware River Parking Authority Building and the New Jersey State Aquarium in Camden.
The curriculum focuses on teaching fellows how to recognize and develop the talents of the people in their neighborhoods, and how to identify all the institutions that can be enlisted to work for a better neighborhood, including churches, banks, schools, businesses and community groups. They are also taught how to apply for money from foundations and other agencies.
At a gathering of fellows here in Morristown last week, one of this year's graduates, Joyce Cook, acting director of social services and programs for the New Community Corporation in Newark, brought laughs when she said of the extensive travels, "Being with N.L.I., you find yourself traveling the entire state of New Jersey."
Then she detailed the benefits.
"You may have thought your problem was just unique to your own little pocket, but you find there are common problems all over the entire state, and you look at effective ways that other groups of people and individuals have attacked the problem, and you say, 'O.K. I can borrow that idea and take it back to my community.' "
 
A Personal Investment In Lessons on Finance
When Carrie Askew graduated from the program in 1995, she came up with the idea for "ABC's of Finance," a course in money management she created for young people in the Paterson area. She also urges their parents to come, too, so they can get something out of the eight-week course she conducts in a room at the church she attends, the Agape Christian Ministries.
"In the urban areas, we are taught little or nothing about money," said Ms. Askew, an income maintenance worker for the Passaic County Board of Social Services. "People have to learn to budget and learn the principles of money management."
Ms. Askew, who holds degrees in business and sociology from William Paterson College and has worked in the business world, starts by having her young students open bank accounts with money they have earned -- no matter how little -- and progresses from there. A highlight of the class is a trip to the New York Stock Exchange.
At graduation, she began giving each student a $25 saving bonds, and after her grant from the leadership program ran out, she started using her own money.
After Beatriz Bueno, a health promotion coordinator for the Morris County Hispanic Affairs Organization in Dover, graduated in 1997, she started a Spanish literacy program to teach immigrants to read and write in their own language.
Ms. Bueno, who in 1994 immigrated with her family from Argentina, where she was a medical doctor, realized the need for the program when she saw a survey of 200 Latinos in the area showing that 20 percent could not read or write.
Her program employs two teachers, plus a baby sitter, and provides transportation to the classes, which meet twice a week for three months.
Although her program has produced only 13 graduates so far, she tells the story of an elderly woman who has learned to write to her daughter in Colombia. "She is so happy," Ms. Bueno said. "That to me is the most important thing."
Uriel Burwell, who graduated last year, was senior tax assessor in Newark until he resigned a month and a half ago to start a community development corporation called New Visions in his neighborhood on the Newark-Irvington border.
Mr. Burwell, a 1993 graduate of Drew University, built the nonprofit organization on a grass-roots group that had coalesced around him six months earlier to handle a number of issues, including crime.
The new organization, devoted to building low- and moderate- income housing, has already set up a council of 50 homeowners. Mr. Burwell is approaching foundations for other projects, including one to help people start their own businesses.
Another 1997 graduate, Joseph J. Keenan Jr., director of the Elizabeth Public Library, said he learned how important it was for all of a community's institutions to work well independently, and to work together creatively to make society better.
To that end, he and the Neighborhood Leadership Initiative organized a meeting of groups that provide after-school programs for young children to explore common concerns.
"Many organizations working in the same geographical area serving the same children in the same business had never talked with each other before," Mr. Keenan said.
Mr. Resnick, the chief program officer for the Community Foundation, said that most applicants accepted for the program in the past were doing projects on their own but that more and more applicants are now coming from community action programs, churches and other groups that can provide structure and support for their ideas.
 
Practical Information And Emotional Support
Whether this year's graduates were new at leadership or old hands, or working alone or in groups, all said they received something invaluable.
Mr. Perez, an AIDS counselor at Jersey City Medical Center and president of the Positive Latino Association, said meeting other leaders created "a sharing of ideas."
Linda J. Lewis, a former branch chief of the Federal Education Department's Office for Civil Rights and a member of the Union Township Board of Education, said, "You gain a confidence that is not arrogance, but it provided you with an informed assertiveness that allows you to go forth and make contact that you normally would not have made."
Jose R. Cuevas, president of the Elizabethport Block Watch and a longtime community organizer in New York City, said an exchange of ideas could reinvigorate people who were burning out.
"It's almost like we established a support system for each other," he said."When I finished this course, I felt a lot more energy as a result of all the positive people I was around."
Donna Cherry, executive director of the Inner City Crime Prevention-Reduction Project in Newark, said, "Well I learned that there's a difference between being an activist and a leader." An activist may respond to a problem, she said, but a leader sees the larger picture.
"There was a lady in my complex that was abducted and shot at gunpoint," Ms. Cherry said. "And from that point we decided we can't let people come into our neighborhood and do these things to us. We have to network and form a block watch. And then what?
"Later, we saw so many other problems we just hadn't paid attention to, like the stolen cars in the area, like a police presence not being in the area," Ms. Cherry said.
"You can't just go say, 'Well, we want this.' You have to make a set plan and bring in the police department and bring in the city council and bring in some other movers and shakers into our meetings," Ms. Cherry said. "And then plan."
Bevelyn Bland, tenant liaison for Brand New Day in Elizabeth, said the courses brought out strong emotions.
"This '98 class was loving and caring," Ms. Bland said. "And the most important part of working in communities, you have to have that loving and caring spirit."
In an evaluation of the Neighborhood Leadership Initiation several years ago, the Center for Social and Community Development of the School of Social Work at Rutgers University wrote that the fellows "are well received in their communities, and report successes ranging from community support and positive outcomes to providing needed services, improving community capacity. collaboration, empowerment and experiencing personal growth."
And Ms. Kenny, the Community Affairs Commissioner, called it "a wonderful program" that dovetails with the administration's urban initiative.
"There's more to do," she said. "It's a big state, and there are a lot of people. But yes, I feel there is an enormous energy that you feel in the cities and when you have grass-roots community leaders, you see the difference they are making in the lives of their respective neighborhoods."
 
Heading Back To Home Base, Ready for Action
BACK in the community, the Leadership Initiative takes many directions. Here's a look at the plans of several 1998 graduates pictured on page 1.
 
BEVELYN BLAND is an Elizabeth resident who works with Brand New Day, a nonprofit corporation that provides affordable housing for low- and moderate-income residents of the Elizabethport area. She also is involved with a tutoring program for 65 youths at the Elizabethport Presbyterian Center. With her grant money, she hopes to unify various efforts to benefit young people in the community.
 
DONNA CHERRY is senior outreach officer for the International Youth Organization, based in Newark. She will be involved with the Constructive Youth Council, which does neighborhood-based planning in public safety, education and other areas.
 
JOYCE COOK of East Orange has worked for 14 years at New Community Corporation in Newark, where she is acting director of social services and programs as well as central outreach coordinator. She hopes to use her grant award, in part, to work with teen-agers.
 
JOSE R. CUEVAS is president of Elizabethport Block Watch and the Puerto Rican Society, as well as a member of several other community organizations in Elizabeth. He would like to start a program to teach young people about mortgages and other financial issues. He is also interested in developing a charter school.
 
LINDA J. LEWIS of Vauxhall, a former official of the Federal Education Department's Office for Civil Rights, is now working as a consultant. Her community activities include membership on the Union Township Board of Education, the Union Public Library Board and the local Americans With Disabilities Act Committee. The projects on which she will be working include a program called Tumbling for Success and the Ministry of Professional Development at her church, the First Baptist Church of Vauxhall.
The deadline to apply for the Neighborhood Leadership Initiative class of '99 is Aug. 1. Information is available from the Community Foundation of New Jersey at (973) 267-5333.

Central Islip Nonprofit Helps Renew a Neighborhood

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

DATELINE: CENTRAL ISLIP

 BODY:
THE frame Cape Cod at 48 Cypress Street in the Lowell Avenue section of this community had been vacant for three years, its boarded windows hiding a bleak interior of decaying and water-damaged rooms.
Now fully renovated, the bright and gleaming three-bedroom house became the home earlier this month of Angel and Wanda Rosado and their two children, Angel Jr., 23, and Alex, 14. The couple purchased it for $79,500, needing only $2,000 for a down payment and $1,500 for closing costs. 
 The event, celebrated on June 11 by a ribbon cutting co-hosted by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Central Islip Civic Council, marked more than the start of homeownership for the Rosados, who had been living in a nearby rental apartment.
It also demonstrated that an unusual partnership program formed a year ago by H.U.D. and the Civic Council, a community-based nonprofit group representing this hamlet's 25,000 residents, can indeed work.
H.U.D. acquires houses when owners default on mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Under the Central Islip program, H.U.D. turns over its properties within the hamlet directly to the nonprofit group at a lower price than it might get from a private buyer.
The Civic Council, in turn, renovates them and resells them to qualified, moderate-income first-time buyers with annual incomes of $30,000 to $50,000.
The goal is to deplete the inventory of vacant H.U.D.-owned houses that are now blighting local neighborhoods while bringing homeownership opportunities to families like the Rosados who, with an annual income of $30,000, have always found owning a house beyond their reach. The Rosados now pay $966 a month for their mortgage and taxes. As renters, they paid $1,000 a month for a two-bedroom apartment.
So far, three houses priced from $69,000 to $79,500, have been renovated and resold by the nonprofit group and an additional six will be completed within the next four months. Prices for those will range from $65,000 to $95,000. There are 135 names on a waiting list.
"We have been trying to do something like this for a long time, but we were never able to work on H.U.D. homes before," said Nancy Manfredonia, the executive director of the Civic Council, which previously has been involved with new housing in partnership with the Town of Islip.
"Foreclosures were something we identified years ago as a major problem in Central Islip," she said, "but we weren't able to do anything about it."
When H.U.D. houses did come on the market, prices were too high to allow them to be renovated for the moderate-income buyers her group serves, she said.
The team effort between H.U.D. and the Civic Council grew out of an initiative begun two years ago by Robert J. Mulvey, director of the Center for Neighborhood and Regional Planning at the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury.
Mr. Mulvey, who also heads a private consulting group called New Directions Community Services, has been working with faculty and students at the college's School of Architecture and Design on revitalization proposals in local communities.
In 1996, he began bringing together planners, lenders, government agencies and local civic groups, inviting them to collaborate with the college in addressing problems confronting needy neighborhoods.
At one of a series of three breakfast meetings, H.U.D. officials offered to work with the Civic Council after Mrs. Manfredonia brought the high number of foreclosures in the Central Islip community to their attention.
"This kind of program is being done in very few places right now," said Bill de Blasio, who heads H.U.D.'s New York-New Jersey office.
"We have been thinking increasingly about ways to involve community-based nonprofits on a broader scale in the disposition of H.U.D. homes," he said. "This is a very good example of how partnering with local community groups can work, and we certainly are looking to doing it more broadly."
Last year H.U.D. foreclosed on 451 houses in the New York City metropolitan area, about half on Long Island.
A NATIONAL policy proposal to turn H.U.D. foreclosures over to the private sector for disposition is under consideration, "but proposals also allow part of that market to be handled by nonprofits," Mr. de Blasio said.
The Central Islip Civic Council has so far focused its efforts on the Lowell Avenue neighborhood where most of the community's foreclosures are occurring.
The 50-year-old subdivision of modest, yet solidly built, ranches, Cape Cods and high ranches has about 1,500 homes. Of those, 50 are vacant houses that have been foreclosed on by lenders, said Mrs. Manfredonia, adding that half of those are owned by H.U.D.
The housing agency periodically sells off its vacant properties but often to the further detriment of the community, said Mrs. Manfredonia. In some cases they are bought by speculators who resell them at a high profit to unqualified buyers allowing the sad cycle of foreclosure to repeat itself, she added..
"We can guarantee that the new people going in can afford the house and that when they take occupancy, all the repairs will be done," she added.
In other cases, foreclosed houses have been purchased by investors who rent them out, often as illegal multiple dwellings, said Mary Ann Huston, the president of the Lowell Avenue Civic Association. "When the Civic Council refurbishes these homes, we will know they will be sold as one-family houses to people who are going to live in them," she said.
The nonprofit group renovates the houses using H.U.D.'s so-called 203K program under which a house can be purchased with a federally-insured mortgage sufficiently large to cover needed repairs and other redevelopment costs, as well as many of the closing costs.
The financing package allows a house needing extensive repairs to be purchased and renovated with a very small cash outlay -- typically about $6,000 for closing costs, said Andrew Thaw, a partner of Whitman Thaw & Associates, a Melville mortgage banker that has been providing 203K financing to the Civic Council.
The home buyer under the Central Islip program can either assume the Civic Council's 203K mortgage or get new financing that may have better interest terms. In either case, Mr. Thaw said, "the consumer is walking into a very low downpayment situation, and they are getting a property that has been totally renovated and that has a lot of equity built in."
The Civic Council paid H.U.D. $25,000 for the 48 Cypress Street house now owned by the Rosados. The $65,170 mortgage it received from Whitman Thaw under the 203K program included $36,000 for refurbishing the house and $1,500 for landscaping.
The nonprofit group needed $7,000 in cash for closing, carrying and administrative costs. The $79,500 sale price to the Rosados gave the Civic Council a $7,000 profit, which will be used to purchase other houses. The Hauppauge-based Long Island Housing Partnership, another nonprofit housing group, has also been providing loans to the Civic Council for the purchase and renovation of houses.
Mrs. Manfredonia said she was also hoping to acquire properties owned by Suffolk County that were seized for nonpayment of taxes and those owned by private lenders who have foreclosed on defaulting owners. She said her group could handle up to 40 houses a year, which would make a significant difference to neighborhoods like Lowell Avenue.
Complementing the housing program will be an architectural and sociological survey of the area, which is being conducted with the help of an $8,000 grant to New Directions Community Services by Citibank.
As part of that survey, New York Institute of Technology architectural students are working on design proposals for improving the neighborhood's aging housing stock. O. Andrew Collver, an associate professor of sociology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, is simultaneously preparing a profile of the community that will help bring its concerns to the attention of government agencies.
As an exultant Mr. Rosado welcomed visitors to his new house on Cypress Street, he struggled to express how he felt about achieving the family's long dream of owning a house.
His work as a mechanic in a Copiague machine shop and his wife's job as a packer for a pharmaceutical company in Hauppauge had never paid enough to make homeownership possible until now, he said.
Sylvia Barnes, a single mother of three who works in an underwriters' lab in Melville, purchased her $75,000 three-bedroom Cape Cod on Birch Street from the Civic Council in December.
"Now I'm paying for something I own," she said. "I'm investing in my future and in my children's future, not someone else's future."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LOWER EAST SIDE;
In This District, Routine Document Is Anything But

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
The scene in front of P.S. 20 on Essex Street Tuesday night was a regular who's who of downtown radicals. The squatters, looking grungy and grumpy, were there in force, holding banners and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes. The pirates, as in radio, also made an appearance, gossiping about a crackdown on an illegal station in Philadelphia. And there was the Lower East Side Collective, a group of college-educated activists who favor khaki and mountain bikes.
The occasion was the monthly meeting of Community Board 3, and what united the crowd was opposition to a little known piece of bureaucratese known as the District Needs Statement. The statement, which each of the 59 community boards file with the city every year, is a broad outline of the state of the district along with general economic, political and social service goals for the coming fiscal year. It is usually ignored by most community district residents. But in the case of District 3, the fiscal year 1999 version was likened to an act of war. 
 Squatters took offense at the statement's description of them as "usurpers" of the abandoned buildings they live in. Organizers of the needle exchange on Avenue C and East Third Street were unhappy to see their project labeled a "misguided social service experiment." And community gardeners interpreted the statement's strong support for new housing as an implicit threat to the abandoned lots they have turned into public greens.
"The District Needs Statement is a common assault on all of us," said Michael Shenker, who squats in a building on the Lower East Side. "We are united by a common enemy, and that enemy is a community board that does not truly represent this community."
The statement, written by the board chairwoman, Susan Vaughn, also caused strife among board members. "The board chair took tremendous liberties," said David Walsh, an architect who has served on the board for two and a half years. "The opinions of all the elected officials who appointed her are at odds with the opinions expressed in the statement."
City Councilwoman Margarita Lopez, who reappointed Ms. Vaughn to the board last spring, said she has long supported the needle exchange program and opposed eviction of squatters. "I was absolutely appalled by that statement," she said.
Ms. Lopez said she was particularly concerned that the statement endorsed expansion of the Work Experience Program, which requires welfare recipients to work for the city to qualify for benefits.
But the board rejected Mr. Walsh's attempt to rescind several sections of the needs statement.
"This is not Susan Vaughn speaking, this is Community Board 3," Ms. Vaughn said. "I don't think there was anything in there that was not supported by board votes."
She added, however, that she regretted the use of "usupers" in reference to the squatters, and that she would seek more collaboration from board committees in drafting the statement for fiscal year 2000. JESSE McKINLEY

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: KINGSBRIDGE;
A Return to '08 Prosperity?

BYLINE: By MARINA LAKHMAN 

 BODY:
When the city extended the IRT to West 231st Street and Broadway in 1908, the Kingsbridge area became a vibrant commercial district, attracting residents from throughout the northwest Bronx. Ninety years later, the area below the el is marked by garbage and graffiti, and its stores draw few nonresidents.
Now legislators, community activists and property owners are edging closer to reviving the commercial area by forming the Kingsbridge Business Improvement District. 
 "The key to the ongoing success and viability of the Kingsbridge shopping district is our ability to attract shoppers from beyond the immediate community," said Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, a proponent of the plan.
Connie Dennis, owner of Columbia Florist on West 231st Street, said, "I believe we have a very strong neighborhood here and it just needs a pick-me-up."
The Kingsbridge Business Improvement District has just received the blessing of Community Board 8 and is preparing to enter the formal approval process, which includes reviews by the Department of City Planning and the City Council. If approved, it will become only the fourth BID in the Bronx.
The Kingsbridge-Riverdale-Van Cortlandt Development Corporation, which has been promoting the BID idea for three years, has the support of 55 percent of the district's business-property owners. The BID will run from West 230th to West 236th Streets along Broadway, and West 231st Street from the Major Deegan Expressway to Corlear Avenue. While no one actively opposes the BID, 45 percent of the district's property owners say they plan not to join it. But if the BID is approved, they will have to pay assessed fees to support it.
With a proposed BID budget of $235,000 a year, the Development Corporation plans to finance additional sanitation and graffiti-removal crews, better security and holiday lights for the area.
Supporters hope that the BID, by attracting new businesses, can help alleviate a chronic vacancy problem. Although the area has only a 5 percent vacancy rate, empty storefronts are an eyesore and may hinder the area's economic viability. Woolworth's recently closed a large store on Broadway, for example.
But a Duane Reade drugstore has just opened on West 231st Street, and Ponce de Leon Federal Savings and Loan Association is renovating a branch of Chemical Bank that closed when Chemical merged with Chase.
Moreover, "a funny thing happened on the way to the BID -- it has changed gross perception in the area," said Bruce Feld, the corporation's BID consultant. As the BID idea has grown, he explained, supporters have been able to showcase the fruits of cooperation.
Last year, for example, two merchants who are on the BID steering committee pitched in to finance Christmas lights for the district. MARINA LAKHMAN

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
A High-Yield Alternative To the Money Markets

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON

 BODY:
AT a time when many money market funds are yielding more than 5 percent, and some more than 5.5 percent, investors could be forgiven for yawning at a fund that threw off just 5.1 percent. So what makes the Heartland Short Duration High-Yield Municipal fund a heart-thumper? It's in the tax-free category, making its yield the equivalent of 8.4 percent to someone in the top 39.6 percent income tax bracket.
A money market-like fund with a junk bond-like yield is the idea behind this offbeat offering, the brainchild of Thomas J. Conlin, 44, and his partner, Greg D. Winston, 33. They moved from Strong Capital Management to Heartland Advisors Inc. in 1996 and managed to persuade William J. Nasgovitz, the firm's president, to try their approach. 
 Their aim was to take advantage of a potentially profitable anomaly in bonds: the near absence of a market for junk-rated muni bonds with very short maturities.
Other mutual funds often buy long-term bonds to reap their higher yields. For example, the other fund managed by Mr. Conlin and Mr. Winston, Heartland High-Yield Municipal Bond, has a yield of 6 percent. But it has to make a trade-off in the so-called effective duration of its bond portfolio. Duration is a measure of a bond's economic life; the higher the number, the more sensitive the bond is to interest-rate swings.
The Short Duration fund has an effective duration of 2.2 years, versus 7.4 years for High-Yield Municipal Bond. "In the past, there hasn't been anyone who's interested in the securities that we're looking at," Mr. Winston said. Bank trust departments, for example, buy only high-quality short-term debt.
That leaves the Heartland portfolio as one of only a few customers for such bonds. "This is a good concept," said Alice Lowenstein, fixed-income editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, the investment newsletter. She said she knew of no other similar funds -- at least not yet.
Since it started in January 1997, the Short Duration fund has delivered an average annual return of 6.6 percent, through May 31, the same as the Lehman Brothers One- to Three-Year High-Yield Municipal Index, which tracks these relatively scarce bonds.
In some ways, the fund looks like a money market fund. Its net asset value is relatively steady, having varied only slightly from the $10 initial offering price; shares are currently worth $10.13. Check-writing is also offered, in minimum amounts of $250. But checks amount to a redemption of assets and can thus incur capital-gains taxes.
"We view this clearly as a money-market alternative," said Mr. Conlin, the more effusive partner. But Mr. Winston, the quieter partner, interrupted: "We have to be careful with our phrasing. We manage for a low degree of share-price variation, but not for a stable net asset value." Mr. Winston, who counts exercise and music as his outside interests, admits to being "a little more risk-averse" than Mr. Conlin, who is a recreational pilot.
The counterbalancing of personalities is reflected in the fund's management style. Both men must agree to buy a bond, but either can force a sale. "If Greg wakes up and something bothers him about a bond, and he comes in and says, 'I want to sell it,' it's gone," Mr. Conlin said. "We think that's a nice check in our process."
How do the two reduce credit risk in what, despite its tame interest-rate exposure, is still a junk-bond fund? They start by focusing on bonds that underwrite essential community services.
"We like projects that affect a large number of people, like water and sewers," Mr. Winston said. "We try to avoid projects that affect a more limited number of people, like a golf course or an aquarium." The latter type is more likely to sour, he said, especially in a recession.
The partners also like borrowers with relatively little debt and plenty of cash flow to service it -- and they prefer bonds with legal covenants that protect bondholders' capital.
The fund often buys short-term portions of issues that also include longer-term bonds. Relatively little yield is lost: The spread between long and short rates in the junk muni market is about 72 hundredths of a percentage point, compared with 95 hundredths in the high-quality universe.
One such issue is the Connecticut Development Authority's 6.875 percent bonds due to mature on Aug. 15, 2004, issued on behalf of a nursing home in Southington, Conn., that specializes in treating Alzheimer's disease. The bonds' structure gives them an effective duration of only three years.
"We have a first mortgage on the facility and a first lien on revenues," Mr. Conlin said. "We think it's well-managed and, best of all, it's 100 percent occupied, with a waiting list."
Sometimes "junk" is a misnomer: More than half the time, the bonds in the fund are simply unrated by agencies like Moody's and Standard & Poor's. Issuers must pay to have their bonds rated, so small issuers can save by selling unrated paper, even if they have to pay junk yields.
An example is a 5.4 percent industrial revenue bond of Topeka, Kan., due April 1, 2005, issued on behalf of Reser's Fine Foods, a food processor based in Beaverton, Ore. Topeka is home to the biggest factory operated by the company, which makes potato salad and other prepared foods.
"This is a family-owned business whose president has been there since the 1950's," Mr. Conlin said. "They cover their niche very well, and their financial numbers are outstanding -- 1997 revenues are just shy of five times debt-service coverage."
The fund also buys longer-term bonds nearing maturity. An example is the 8.2 percent bonds issued in 1984 by O'Hare International Airport of Chicago on behalf of United Airlines. The bonds are rated as junk by S.& P. because the airline, not the city, stands behind the revenues generated from lease payments on landing gates. "Our belief is that if United misses a payment, there will be countless other airlines lining up to take those gates and make those payments," Mr. Conlin said.
The bonds are callable on May 1, 1999, at $103 per $100 face amount. The fund bought them last month for a price that gives an effective yield to the call date of 4.8 percent. "If we were to go buy a money market security we'd get 3.25 percent, and here we're getting 4.8 percent," Mr. Conlin said. "This is perfect."
The men see themselves as value investors who aim to buy cheaply, usually because a bond is under a cloud for some reason. "We buy things when they're down," Mr. Conlin said. "Then we're very patient. We both understand it takes a lot of time for your credit stories to play out."

HEADLINE: A Warming Trend For Canadian Stocks?

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
START with a strong, rebounding economy. Add an apparently undervalued stock market. Throw in a national currency that seems to have been pummeled by one Arctic blast after another.
To many investors, that sounds like a recipe for bargains. And it explains why some are hungrily watching the Canadian stock market. 
 The mere mention of Canada, though, can stop some otherwise eager American investors cold. Over the years the nation to the north has produced enough seedy mining companies and dubious oil stocks to fill the St. Lawrence Seaway. Its smaller stock exchanges have reputations for lax regulation and even slacker enforcement. And deep frustration can await an investor who tries to get the same kind of detailed information about a Canadian company that is readily available about companies whose stocks are traded in the United States.
But many analysts see in Canada something hard to find in the United States: plenty of upside potential.
Canada's domestic economy could hardly look more promising. Growth is strong, inflation is low and upward pressure on wages is almost nonexistent. And the weakness of the Canadian dollar, which reached an all-time low in mid-June and was worth about 68 American cents on Friday, is bolstering the country's exports. They will soon account for half the country's total output.
Still, valuations of Canadian stocks have lately lagged behind those of their American cousins. According to Fred Sturm, portfolio manager of the Ivy Canada mutual fund, business prospects for companies in sectors other than natural resources, Canada's traditional strength, are still attractive, but their stocks are currently trading at levels 10 percent to 20 percent below those of their south-of-the-border counterparts.
And because Canada's commodities businesses depend heavily on exports, now depressed by the disruptions in Asian economies, Canadian natural-resource stocks are even cheaper, trading at discounts of 20 to 30 percent to similar American stocks.
Canadian stocks generally would be more appealing to Joseph M. Scarella, a portfolio manager at Oppenheimer Capital, if he could see a "spike-like bottoming" in commodity prices in three to six months. Those prices are low because of worldwide oversupply as well as the Asian situation. But he said improvement would be gradual.
Andrew Root, who works at Goldman, Sachs as an analyst of paper and forest-product companies, likes Donohue, Domtar and MacMillan Bloedel, Canadian companies in that field. But he said he did not expect their stock prices to crawl out of their trough "until the market gets its hands around the situation in Asia."
Mr. Sturm, whose Ivy Canada is one of the few Canadian-oriented mutual funds available to American investors, says low commodity prices have created a buying opportunity. He reasons that commodities have nowhere to go but up and that when they do, Canadian natural-resource companies can be expected to outperform the broader market, as they have in the past.
Mark Chandler of Goldman, Sachs Canada pointed out that the falling value of Canada's currency had helped to offset the damage from the commodity slump, keeping Canadian output competitively priced.
Because of strong prospects for the overall Canadian economy, Mr. Chandler said, Canadian stocks should return about 10 percent over the next 12 months, just as they have over the last 12. Such a steady pace may not look like much compared with the 28 percent run-up of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the last year, but it could be soothing to investors who worry that the United States market is due for a meltdown.
There are signs that profits for Canadian companies have not yet peaked. For the first quarter of 1998, they accounted for just 8.9 percent of Canada's national income. "That tells us that corporate profits aren't yet overextended," Mr. Chandler said. "The historical average is closer to 10 percent."
ONE way for cautious investors to play the Canadian stock market is to invest in companies that generate a high percentage of their revenue outside Canada. Robert Reiner, who helps manage the BT Investment International Equity fund, sees that advantage in three of his four favorite Canadian stocks.
BCE, the parent of Bell Canada, is one of the few big telecommunications companies that also has a well-situated interest in the telephone equipment industry, which is booming worldwide.
Cadillac Fairview, which owns and develops commercial real estate, has almost a fifth of its assets in the United States, something that he suspects most investors haven't noticed.
Newcourt Credit is currently Mr. Reiner's top pick. The company arranges asset-based financing for large companies and institutions, most of them outside Canada, and is the biggest pure play in its field, which is led by GE Capital, Mr. Reiner said. He expects Newcourt's earnings to grow 50 percent next year.
His fourth recommendation, the Royal Bank of Canada, is somewhat surprising. Canadian bank stocks have run way up recently, posting much bigger gains than the S.& P. banking index showed this year and last, and some investors might feel edgy about parking money in the sector.
But the Royal Bank is a leader in consolidating and has a merger pending with the Bank of Montreal. And, unlike banks in the United States, Canada's banks dominate the domestic mutual fund industry, which is just taking off with consumers.
According to Lori B. Appelbaum, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, Canadian bank stocks are trading at a discount of 10 percent to 15 percent to those of their American counterparts, even though expected earnings growth is just as strong, at 12 percent to 13 percent annually. She likes Canadian Imperial Bank and Toronto Dominion as well as Royal.
But there are two clouds on the horizon for Canadian bank stocks, according to Mr. Scarella at Oppenheimer Capital, and they both emanate from the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank. Interest rates could be raised to stem the slide of the currency, and there could be a move to block the Royal Bank merger with the Bank of Montreal. "I think this merger has only a 50-50 chance of happening," Mr. Scarella said. "There's a lot of momentum building up against it, especially among rural Canadians who think it will cause banks to close up offices."
But money managers like Mr. Reiner remain bullish. "There's this bias that all you can buy in Canada are commodity stocks, when in fact the country has some of the best banks, industrials and technology companies in the world," he said. "There are a lot of overlooked stocks in Canada, and for the most part, U.S. mutual fund managers still haven't discovered them."

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
For Cool Hunters, Tomorrow's Trend Is the Trophy

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT 

 BODY:
WHEN the Ladies Who Lunch at Bergdorf ask Claire Ramsey where she found that faaaabulous outfit, she knows that she's on to a trend, and that she has just earned a few hundred bucks.
Ms. Ramsey, a 30-year-old New York University graduate student in public health, works as a cafe hostess at Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan. But she is also a "cool hunter" -- a person whose taste is so ahead of the curve that a trend analysis firm pays her a $200-to-$500 bounty for helping to identify the Next Big Things to sweep popular culture. 
 No one knows how many cool hunters are prowling America's malls and streets, but cool hunting is one of the latest trends in trend analysis.
Beginning in the late 1960's, marketing research pioneers like Yankelovich Partners and Roper Starch Worldwide measured opinion by conducting scientific polls, following up with focus-group research.
Now firms like Iconoculture, Sputnik, Agent X, Lambesis and Youth Intelligence, which employs Ms. Ramsey and nine other part-time cool hunters aged 14 to 30, are incorporating cool hunting, an anthropological field-study approach to trend spotting.
The hunters prowl inner-city basketball courts, fashionable nightclubs and houses in the Hamptons, observing the arbiters of coolness whose tastes may eventually be adopted by the general populace. (Hey, someone had to be the first to wear a baseball cap backward.)
These firms report to a corporate Who's Who that includes Coca-Cola, MTV, General Mills and Wendy's International. The companies, in turn, use the information to formulate new products and to devise marketing campaigns that grab the attention of the crucial youth market.
"The trendsetters are the ones breaking new ground in consumer product areas, and they give you insights into what will be widely developed down the road," said Janet Taylor, director of college marketing for Sprint and a client of Youth Intelligence, a firm based in New York.
Three years ago, when Youth Intelligence's analysis suggested that tattoos would become popular, Sprint wound up luring students to a calling-card promotion with marketing that included temporary tattoos. Sprint declined to discuss exact figures for the campaign but said it had produced twice as many sign-ups as had been expected.
Jim Wicks, the director of the Sony design center in San Francisco, said the company had made use of cool-hunter insights when designing a new Walkman, the Freq, for young athletic users.
"It uses special graphics, it uses special materials to hold it to the body, and the Freq logo is more prominent than the Sony logo," Mr. Wicks said. "It was using heavy-duty clips, much like chains you see them wearing.
"Cool is the reason people buy things," he added. "A shirt is a shirt and it fulfills a function, but you buy the one with the logo you think is cool."
JUST as the qualities of cool are hard to pin down, so are the criteria for becoming its hunter. The firms say their hunters have a taste level that is avant-garde but not so far out that it won't become mainstream.
Jane Rinzler Buckingham, the founder of Youth Intelligence, for example, saw Ms. Ramsey in a cafe about four years ago wearing Mhendi -- an intricate Indian henna-based skin decoration -- ahead of the pack that would soon follow. Ms. Buckingham asked about the Mhendi and found Ms. Ramsey articulate about why she liked certain items and fashions. And that was it.
"It wasn't just about her taste -- it was that she didn't care about trends yet naturally anticipated them," Ms. Buckingham recalled.
For Ms. Ramsey, the job isn't work. She and other hunters file their reports informally, and not on a regular basis, though if Youth Intelligence does not hear from a hunter it will call at least three times a year.
One of Ms. Ramsey's research methods is to be her own laboratory rat. "I can't necessarily afford the high-end fashion, so I make my own things up," she said. If a particular item draws comments, it may make her list.
She also has a knack for spotting up-and-coming fashions on others. Three years ago, she noticed an elderly woman wearing an attractive ring. It was a Lalique ring, and Ms. Ramsey ran out and bought one, reporting this to Youth Intelligence. "Recently young people started buying them," she said. "There are all of these plastic knockoffs of it."
Though being a cool hunter sounds, well, cool, trend analysis companies consider the term derisive, applying it only to hired hands like Ms. Ramsey. Cool hunting, the firms say, doesn't require sophisticated analysis of why an item is cool, a service that the research firms provide. One firm, Sputnik, refused to discuss the topic without a guarantee that the words "cool" and "hunter" would not appear in the article.
Still, there is a career track for former cool hunters.
Tru Pettigrew, 30, started out surveying schoolyards for cool as research for Converse, the sneaker company. But now, at Arnold Communications, an advertising agency in Boston, he is the "Voice of the Consumer" -- a broader job researching youth culture. Between that position and his publication of Tru Flava, a quarterly newsletter on youth trends, Mr. Pettigrew said he earns $40,000 to $60,000 annually.
Mr. Pettigrew plies his trade scouring schoolyards and clubs for new cool -- he says, for instance, that clothes with big logos are old news.
"Kids are getting away from having a Hilfiger all across the chest," he said. "They want the smaller logo. They don't want to look like they are trying too hard."
He also runs informal focus groups, taking products -- and, sometimes, company executives -- out on the street for a sort of urban cool safari. Mr. Pettigrew has a retinue of teachers and coaches in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Baltimore, Houston, Chicago and Boston who put him in contact with teen-agers. Though the young people are seldom paid cash, they usually receive products, he said.
Cool-industry specialties are popping up, too. For instance, Richard Rushfield and Adam Leff founded Agent X, a cool-hunting firm in Los Angeles that advises the entertainment industry exclusively. "We help them decide what movies to make because they are working on projects for two and three years down the road," Mr. Rushfield said.
Mr. Rushfield, a former political consultant, and Mr. Leff, who wrote screenplays including "The Last Action Hero," offer their clients trend tours, showing studio executives what is hot. More often they lecture, then field questions.
"They ask, 'Will pirates be in?' " Mr. Rushfield said. The answer is no -- witness 1995's epic pirate bomb, "Cutthroat Island."
But Agent X gives a thumbs-up to upbeat road pictures and films embracing "traditional community values." Each genre, in its own way, is an escape from complex moral choices, Mr. Rushfield said; road movies are "a subset of the trend toward a desire for fun removed from a moral context," while traditional-value films appeal to audiences "looking to go back to simple, basic ways."
That means that future cinematic good guys are less likely to be businessmen, who may be seen as morally tainted, than firefighters, whose image remains largely uncorrupted, Mr. Rushfield said.
"Firemen represent simple, straightforward decency," he said.
THE pair work by traveling to big cities around the country, using their radar to spot cool stuff. They compile much of it into a one-page chart, called "Intelligence Report," that runs occasionally in Vanity Fair magazine. Now at work on a humorous how-to book on spotting trends, the pair say their firm will bring in $1.2 million next year.
Back in New York, Ms. Ramsey cannot claim such a hefty payday. Still, she appreciates the money she does get.
"It's pennies from heaven," she mused. "I can rely that it's there, but I can't rely when it's coming."

Chart/Photos: "Coming Up ..."
O.K., so what's the Next Big Thing? There are so many from which to choose. Three trend-analysis experts offer some forecasts.
 
Jane Rinzler Buckingham of Youth Intelligence in New York:
 
MOROCCO
 
It's exotic, it's unknown, it offers romance, fantasy, outdoor adventure, and you won't find a mini-mall there.
 
ALSO ...RYAN PHILLIPE: The actor, soon to be seen in the movie, 54, is young, good-looking, and I think everyone is looking for an alternative to Leonardo.
 
Richard Rushfield of Agent X in Los Angeles:
 
BALLROOM DANCING
 
I think the swing dancing movement is topping out and will be replaced by ballroom.
 
ALSO ...THE OFFICE: The office will become the hangout and romance-thriller setting in fiction. It's not a new thing, but it always swings between office and home, and right now it's the office.

SKIBOARDING

ALSO ... BUTTON-FRONT BASEBALL JERSEYS:
Baseball as a sport and culture has been dead so long that the old-fashioned jerseys have an almost 'old-school' feel, and kids are into old school right now.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
Every Second Counts Even More

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
WHO says economics is the dismal science? O.K., O.K.: just about everybody. Who but an economist, after all, would insist that unemployment can be too low or that the stock market can be too high?
But nobody ever accused the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas of spreading doom and gloom. Indeed, the Dallas Fed is probably best known for a study showing that poverty in America is largely a statistical misunderstanding. 
 Perhaps not surprisingly, that take on poverty never passed muster with the gatekeepers of the economics establishment. But the same researchers, W. Michael Cox and Richard Alm, are at it again. And this time the good-news guys are apt to raise fewer hackles with their paean to the virtues of technological change and productivity growth.
"Time Well Spent: The Declining Real Cost of Living in America," an essay by Mr. Cox and Mr. Alm that is part of the Dallas Fed's 1997 annual report, is short on hard-core analysis. But the then-and-now statistical comparisons, showing how much more the average American can now buy with so much less effort, are fun to check out.
For the record, the Dallas Fed economists are not the first to take issue with the idea that prices are far higher today than they were, say, a century ago. Indeed, the argument about long-term price comparisons is well-known to Econ 101 students as the Sears Catalogue Paradox.
If prices are really so much higher today, the premise goes, it follows that most people would prefer to spend $1,000 on goods from a century-old Sears catalogue at 1898 prices than go on a $1,000 shopping spree for today's goods at today's prices.
In fact, most people would choose the second option. While it would be nice to be able to buy a pound of nails or a dozen spools of cotton thread for a few pennies from the old catalogue, hardly anyone would want to own the primitive sewing machines or bicycles from the 1898 catalogue at any price. (For the sake of this discussion, set aside their value as collectibles.)
Besides, many things that make life pleasant, even bearable, simply weren't for sale in 1898. "No amount of income would make my life better if I couldn't buy my arthritis drugs," noted Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
On the other hand, said Mr. Krugman, the author of "The Accidental Theorist" (Norton), the Sears Catalogue Paradox misses part of the point because it looks backward rather than forward. The variety and quality of goods that Americans take for granted today could not be had at any price in 1898, but staples -- food and shelter -- have certainly risen in price since the 19th century.
Brad DeLong, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, put it another way. As new, improved products come along, he noted, "the rich substitute out of whatever luxury goods they were consuming like bandits." But a peasant in, say, Haiti, would happily give up access to antilock automobile brakes or computer games that he can't possibly afford in return for rice, cooking oil and shoes at 1898 prices.
Mr. Cox and Mr. Alm don't mess around with such ambiguities. They have a simpler point to make -- that "the real cost of living isn't measured in dollars and cents but in hours and minutes we must work to live."
And by this yardstick, living has become a lot easier. Consider that staple of modern life, the television set. Back in 1971, the average worker had to toil 174 hours to earn enough money for a 25-inch color receiver. In 1997, a much more reliable TV cost just 23 hours on the job.
Or consider the three-pound chicken that every American used to put in his pot before Pizza Hut opened at the mall. That chicken cost $3.15 in 1997, almost triple the price in 1919. But it took the average worker just 15 minutes to earn that chicken, compared with 158 minutes in 1919.
What has happened, of course, is that technology, education and machinery have made workers far more productive than their counterparts of 20, 50 or 100 years ago. Mass-produced bits of silicon have replaced exquisitely formed (yet short-lived) vacuum tubes in TV's. And chickens, which used to scratch out a living behind the barn, are now scientifically assembled from vegetable protein and antibiotics.
About the only items that have become more expensive in terms of work time are movie tickets and college degrees.
Just why movies (and thus movie tickets) cost more in recent years is a genuine puzzle. One hypothesis is that the shift in power from the studios to the stars has undermined competitive pressures that would have kept Hollywood salaries down.
Soaring tuition is also a bit odd. The opportunities for increasing productivity are generally more limited in service industries (as opposed to manufacturing): As William Baumol, an economist at New York University, is fond of pointing out, it takes as many musicians just as long to play a Mozart trio today as in the year it was composed. Still, with college tuition such a high-profile issue, one might have expected labor-saving improvements in education over time.
But the Dallas Fed economists have a simpler explanation. In both cases, they assure us, the product has been improved.
Who, after all, would rather watch a bunch of actors in shades of gray when they could watch Godzilla take a bite out of the Empire State Building in glorious Surroundsound? And who could resent the $150,000 price tag of an Ivy League education that lands them on the Wall Street gravy train?
If Mr. Cox and Mr. Alm had stopped about here, few would be inclined to quibble. But they cannot resist tossing in a bit of ideology. This life-enhancing bounty of the modern economy, they contend, depends on the wide differences in living standards between rich and poor.
"Without society's wealthy, fewer new goods and services would find their way to the rest of us," they write.
"Far from being a blight on society, unequal income distribution is instrumental in driving society forward. It's a natural resource."
Marie Antoinette couldn't have said it better.

Chart: "Time Is Money"
W. Michael Cox and Richard Alm, economists at the Dallas Federal Reserve, contend that workers today can afford more of the basics, and the good life, than ever before, provided that time -- not wages -- is the gauge used to measure affordability.
Calculations of the work time needed to buy goods and services use the average wage for production and nonsupervisory workers in manufacturing, which Mr. Cox and Mr. Alm set at $13.18 an hour for 1997.

HEADLINE: Uttering the P-Word With Social Security

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
AN idea that sounded heretical only a year or two ago is suddenly popping up in all corners.
Privatizing Social Security -- having individuals divert a portion of their payroll taxes into personal retirement investment accounts -- is part of the overhaul plans offered by Democratic and Republican leaders, from moderates like Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, to conservatives like Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas. 
 It is also at the core of a plan proposed in May by the National Commission on Retirement Policy, a private group formed by the Center for Strategic and International Studies and led by Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, and three other members of Congress. The plan has become a focus of debate over privatization in part because of its influential bipartisan support and because its detailed provisions have been scrutinized by Government actuaries.
According to its proponents, privatization will help cure Social Security's financial and philosophical flaws -- among other things, giving young workers, who have grown disillusioned with the New Deal program, a shot at earning a fair return on their payroll tax dollar.
But a growing chorus of economists says the benefits of privatization are illusory. The critics contend that private accounts will not help achieve long-term solvency and, counterintuitive though it seems, that they will not outperform the sad-sack Social Security trust fund into which payroll taxes now go. Indeed, on a level playing field, the critics argue, private accounts as a whole are bound to do worse than the trust fund. And all this change, they add, poses a needless risk, because Social Security is only mildly out of fiscal whack.
It isn't difficult to understand why the political ground has shifted so quickly. Republicans have controlled Congress since 1994, and Social Security, as a gargantuan Government program, has never been the darling of conservatives. Another reason is that the program is running out of money; in about 20 years, when the baby boomers begin to retire, the system will be paying out more in retirement checks than it will be collecting in payroll taxes. So some kind of fix is needed.
Moreover, the stock market has been soaring, just when Americans are becoming accustomed to investing some of their retirement money in self-directed 401(k) plans. Many, especially younger workers who don't expect Social Security to survive until their retirement, are unhappy about seeing their payroll contributions tied up in the low-yielding trust fund rather than some high-flying stock fund.
And so, like other would-be reformers of Social Security, the commission set out both to restore the system to solvency and to create a new political constituency for a national retirement system.
 
A Crisis With 2 Solutions
The so-called crisis confronting Social Security is this: It would take a reserve of $3 trillion today to pay the difference between benefits that will be distributed and taxes that will be collected over the next 75 years. This ominous-sounding number is cited by those who advocate extensive changes. But the defenders of the current system say the budget hole is not formidable, and can be filled by raising payroll taxes by about two percentage points, to about 14.5 percent.
Crisis or not, the commission, unwilling to buck the anti-tax mood in Congress, would achieve long-term balance by cutting benefits. The cuts could, for example, reduce the first-year benefits of an individual born in the 1980's by about 30 percent.
The most striking provision calls for raising the normal retirement age to 70 by 2029 and the early retirement age to 65 by 2017. Thereafter, the commission calls for these retirement ages to rise in line with life expectancy. In other words, as medical breakthroughs allow people to live longer, the commission would have them spend all of the additional years at work.
Representative Charles W. Stenholm of Texas, a co-chairman of the retirement commission, says the commission proposes raising retirement ages in this way to avoid "imposing higher payroll taxes or substantially reducing retirement benefits."
Critics of this proposal, like Peter Diamond, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, call the proposal "unrealistic." It runs counter to "a century of trend toward earlier retirement," Professor Diamond said.
Though the commission's initial round of benefit changes would, by themselves, achieve long-term financial balance for Social Security, the 24-member panel does not stop there. Instead, it adds a proposal to partially privatize the retirement system. Workers would deposit 2 percent of their earnings in private accounts, choosing among widely diversified stock and bond funds authorized by the Federal Government. That would leave 10.4 percent of earnings in the trust fund.
In part, the idea is to restore younger workers' faith in Social Security, explained Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, a co-chairman of the commission. Workers who think of their payroll tax contributions as an investment often see the Social Security trust fund as a raw deal: For every $100 that young workers pay into the fund today, they are likely to get back at retirement 30 years hence only about $150, an annual rate of return of between 1 and 2 percent after taking account of inflation. Senator Gregg said private accounts would "offer much higher rates of return."
The commission also wants to turn Social Security into a national savings program, a change from the current approach of paying today's retirees with today's workers' taxes. The commission's idea, Senator Gregg explained, is to encourage workers to save and invest, helping the economy grow richer and making tomorrow's workers better able to afford the burden of supporting their parents. He acknowledges that merely diverting existing taxes into private accounts does not raise national savings. But the commission also invites workers to deposit up to $2,000 a year extra into these tax-advantaged savings vehicles.
 
Cuts That Run Deeper
The rub is that privatization -- which, remember, is not needed to "save" Social Security -- would worsen the system's financial balance, at least temporarily, by diverting payroll taxes that would otherwise be available to pay current retirees.
The commission's solution is to propose a second round of temporary benefit cuts for retirees who are not poor. It would set each year's benefits for new retirees at between 98 and 99 percent of the previous year's figure. While cuts of less than 2 percent sound small, they add up. By the 20th year of the program, the benefit of a middle-class family, now about $1,000 a month, would have fallen about 20 percent.
Yet the commission, pointing to actuarial projections, says workers would fare better with privatization because income from the investments would more than make up for its second round of benefit cuts.
But critics say privatization won't really benefit workers or the economy.
That sounds bizarre: After all, how can a portfolio of stocks and bonds yielding, say, 5 percent above inflation, not beat the trust fund's 1 percent return? The critics say the comparison is misleading.
The trust fund looks bad in part because, unlike private accounts, under current law it can't invest in stocks. Also, returns on the trust fund look measly because it bears the burden of paying off unfinanced claims -- $9 trillion in benefits that the system has promised to pay but against which it has accumulated no reserves. The private accounts bear none of this burden.
If it were not for the fact that private accounts would be allowed to invest in stocks -- and critics have a lot to say about the misleading nature of that advantage -- they would provide no financial benefit to workers.
In a forthcoming book on overhauling Social Security, the economists John Geanakoplos of Yale, Olivia Mitchell of the Wharton School and Stephen Zeldes of Columbia University point out that, with or without private accounts, workers must pay for the system's unfinanced claims -- unless Congress does the unthinkable and breaks its promise to several generations of retirees. Either lawmakers will tax the necessary money out of the new private accounts, reducing their yield, or they will cut future benefits for today's young workers.
These economists argue that the extra profit that workers earn on the dollars they deposit into their private accounts is exactly offset by the extra loss that they suffer on their deposits into the trust fund -- assuming, still, that the private accounts invest in the same low-risk securities held by the trust fund. So the income of retirees would not change, the economists say.
But proponents of privatization counter that most individuals will invest in stocks and outperform the trust fund. The actuaries' projections bear them out. Individuals who invest in stocks under the commission's plan are likely to have slightly more income upon retirement than they would under the current system once it is brought into long-run balance.
But critics warn that comparisons among yields on private and public retirement funds don't take into account that stock purchases would expose workers to risk that the trust fund does not.
A fair test would compare private accounts to a trust fund that would, as many economists propose, invest in corporate stocks and bonds. By that standard, Mr. Diamond, along with Henry J. Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution, contend that the trust fund would actually outperform private accounts. Private accounts, these economists say, would be more expensive to administer.
Just think, they say, of the costs of more than 140 million itsy-bitsy accounts versus one giant Government investment fund.
Mr. Aaron worries, too, about exposing the retirement income of individual workers to the risks of investing in the stock market. He would rather see the Social Security trust fund build reserves -- his preferred way to bolster national savings -- and invest in corporate stocks and bonds while continuing to pay a set level of benefits to retirees.
"Why move to a system that produces, after taking account of administration expenses, lower returns and subjects the elderly to unwanted risk?" Mr. Aaron asked scornfully. Besides, he added, privatization plans like the commission's would inevitably widen the gap between rich and poor because poor workers could be expected to load their accounts with low-yield bonds while the wealthier and more knowledgeable focus on stocks.
 
About Those Surpluses
The critics' arguments veer quickly from arithmetic into politics, as do those of the proponents of privatization.
Some economists who favor privatization -- notably Professor Martin Feldstein of Harvard, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Reagan Administration -- vigorously oppose any plan that has a Government-run retirement fund buy big chunks of American business. He fears political manipulation of investment decisions -- for example, by ruling out the purchase of shares in tobacco companies -- though Mr. Aaron and other liberal economists say Government investments could be insulated against that threat.
The Feldstein plan, broadly embraced by Senator Gramm, would make up for the 2 percent of earnings workers could put in private accounts by directing $1 trillion in Federal surpluses over the next decade into the Social Security fund. At retirement, workers would collect a benefit from the trust fund equal to that of the current law, plus 25 percent of the money that has accumulated in their individual accounts. The balance of the private accounts would be turned back to Social Security.
Everyone, Mr. Feldstein says, would come out ahead, countering Mr. Aaron's worries about exposing the elderly to unwanted financial risk. Mr. Aaron dismisses the plan's rosy outcomes as distorted by its tapping of temporary Government surpluses. The windfall could be used at least as effectively, Mr. Aaron suggests, to build up reserves in the trust fund.
 
Irreconcilable Differences?
The political distance between the combatants appears at least as great as the economic distance.
Senator Gregg embraces private accounts, saying they "will create a sense of ownership and control."
"You know, that is the capitalist system," he said. "You take a personal interest in what you personally own."
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, calls the existing program "the most successful Federal program ever enacted" and says privatization would "risk turning Social Security into social insecurity."
Economists are no more reconcilable. Mr. Aaron says tough-minded safeguards would allow Government to buy perhaps 15 percent of the equity on Wall Street, free of political influences. Mr. Feldstein refuses to seriously entertain the notion, no matter what safeguards Mr. Aaron concocts. So what starts out as a fight over actuary tables becomes a battle over the role of Government. The numbers will no doubt be easier to resolve.

If the Social Security trust fund and proposed private retirement accounts invest in the same kinds of securities, the privatization plan at best comes out even with the existing system, many economists say. That is because money still must be diverted to pay for the $9 trillion in unfinanced benefits owed to current and future retirees. Critics say any advantage that the private account would enjoy by investing in stocks and bonds could be realized more efficiently by the trust fund. Chart describes the current system and the partially privatized system. (pg. 12)

HEADLINE: Striking Back

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
THE small lobby of 362 Sutter Avenue in Brownsville is so busy with the traffic of daily life that it seems impossible that a murder could occur there, certainly not in broad daylight. It is a place where adults collect mail and children collect friends. A glass wall separates the lobby from a leafy courtyard where many people who live in the Van Dyke Houses pass afternoons.
Yet just after 5 P.M. on a Friday afternoon two months ago, prosecutors say, Samuel Tolliver, used a tree limb to bludgeon his live-in girlfriend of 10 years, Karan Brown Chambers, to death there. Mr. Tolliver had just been released from jail, where he had served part of a 60-day sentence for assaulting Ms. Chambers. He was under a court order to stay away from her for three years. Instead, within three days, he returned to where they had lived, asking her to fetch him shirts. She did. They fought. According to prosecutors, he slammed her repeatedly in the head with the branch. Her screams echoed into the courtyard. She bled from the head on the tile floor. 
 Perhaps it happened too fast for anyone to do anything. Perhaps residents were scared of Mr. Tolliver, whom they call a boozing, brooding man. Or perhaps, says Sandra Bryant, Ms. Chambers's neighbor and friend, people were used to seeing them fight. "If they always see him beating her up, they think he's just going to beat her up," Ms. Bryant said. "They fight today and they're back together tomorrow. They work it out themselves."
That notion, that two adults consent to a relationship, and to its brutality, has long shaped society's and the criminal-justice system's response to domestic violence, making neighbors reluctant to intervene, the police to arrest, the courts to prosecute. So has the fact that women often return to their abusers or invite them back.
But in New York that response is changing dramatically. Once, accused abusers faced little more than a police officer telling them to take a walk and cool down. Now, in some boroughs, particularly Brooklyn, prosecutors will build cases against them, even without victims' cooperation. Defendants may end up in a specialized domestic violence court, like the one that opened last week in the Bronx. And if they don't end up in jail, they will find themselves watched, intently, by the many eyes of the legal system.
"The laws are taking it much more seriously, the Police Department is taking it much more seriously," says Paula Rogowsky, the director of the Brooklyn Criminal Court Program for Victim Services, a not-for-profit agency that provides services for domestic abuse victims.
But each new solution has brought problems of its own -- and at times controversy -- along with the acknowledgement that there are places the system cannot always reach: the minds of some batterers, the hearts of some victims and the ties that bind the two.
In a room in lower Manhattan, 13 accused abusers gather to discuss their behavior. For Thomas, the issue is clothes, or the lack of them. "Today my girlfriend wore something I didn't think was appropriate," he says, describing the miniskirt and tight top hugging her "beautiful, perfect body." They argued, he says, raising his voice and rising from his chair as he re-enacts the scene. "I have to call myself back," he says bitterly, "be a little dog, drive her where she wants, watch these guys watch her. I have to take this from her and not get angry."
His volatility is obvious, and ominous, since his attendance at this group-counseling session for batterers was ordered by a judge after Thomas was arrested for abusing the same woman. He and the dozen other men report to the New York City Alternative Assistance Program, on Broadway, once a week for 30 weeks. If they "act aggressive" -- yelling, throwing furniture, stalking from the room -- the court gets a report. If they miss two sessions, they may be sent to jail.
The program's goal is to get batterers to take responsibility for their behavior, and to accept that there is no excuse for abuse, that anger must be expressed without violence and that leaving a bad relationship is better than duking it out.
The director, Dr. Jack Sarmanian, who agreed to allow a reporter to attend a session as long as only the men's first names were used, watches Thomas intently and probes gently. "Do you have a good relationship?" he asks. But he prefers to let the other men offer guidance, hoping they will learn ways to control their anger and jealousy as much as Thomas's. Some men, familiar with the modesty problem, offer solutions: buy her looser clothes. Compliment first, encourage more clothes later; take pride in her beauty.
Others throw cold water on Thomas's rage. "Is she respectful?" James asks. She is. "Then what's your problem?"
The men, from different economic and ethnic groups, have one thing in common: they are being called to account for behavior few thought was a crime. At times, they seem like Rip Van Winkles, suddenly awake in, and baffled by, a society in which women demand help with housecleaning, wear what they want and act as they please.
A strong sense of injustice hangs in the air. "We're all sitting around here because we're supposed to have abused our wives," Earl says. "What about women who abuse men?" (They go to groups, too, Dr. Sarmanian says.)
The men describe women who derail their attempts to cool down. A group leader suggests that the men schedule time to talk about difficult issues with their wives. But, Marcel asks, "How do you find the time with an alcoholic when with her it's always Miller time?"
Edgar admits he also uses alcohol, to uncork the anger bottled up inside. "My anger stews," he says, quietly. "I'm angry about being here right now, actually."
After the one-hour session ends, Alfred, an Indian immigrant, explains that he hit his wife because she stole from him to buy drugs. His mother, he said, taught him that you hit people who don't listen to you; his father reinforced the lesson with constant example. Alfred himself insists he never lost control with his wife, even as he shows the sweeping backhand that knocked out her teeth and landed him in the program.
More than 450 people, mostly men, have completed the program since it started in 1994. About 500 people a year attend Alternatives to Violence, a similar program started by Victim Services in 1982. There are no reliable studies of what happens to the participants. Indeed, no one knows for sure whether such programs work, whether domestic violence is treatable at all in the way that drug abuse is. But judges say they are effective as monitoring devices.
"For the most part you are not dealing with hard criminals who have done hard time," says Judge La Tia Martin of Bronx Criminal Court, who hears only domestic violence cases. The threat of incarceration if they drop out of a program "may be enough to jolt them."
 
Arrests Mandatory, And They Increase
Five years ago, many of these men would not even have been in the justice system. But in 1994, the Police Department, following state and national trends, began treating domestic violence as a serious crime problem. Specially trained officers were assigned to each precinct, and all officers were instructed to file a domestic incident report for every complaint of domestic abuse. The police began making regular visits to households with histories of abuse.
In 1994, the State Legislature passed a mandatory arrest law, under which officers must make an arrest in all felony domestic abuse cases and in all misdemeanor cases unless the victim asks them not to and they are convinced that person's safety is not threatened.
Last year, there were 27,085 domestic violence arrests in the city, up from 20,793 in 1995. "We have had women coming in recently saying, 'This has been going on for 25 years and suddenly they arrested him.' " says Ms. Rogowsky, of Victim Services. "There is more faith in the system."
Like any blunt policy instrument, though, mandatory arrest spawned problems of its own. "Clearly we have seen a major shift," says Deputy Inspector William Connors, commander of the Police Department's Domestic Violence Bureau, "borne out by the fact that now we are arresting too many people."
Victims' advocates and the police agree that some batterers are abusing the law -- filing false complaints so their victims will be arrested. And many officers called to fights between couples have been so confused by the barrage of accusations sides that they arrest both parties. The problem of cross complaints became so serious that last October the Legislature passed a law requiring officers at domestic violence scenes to identify and arrest the main physical aggressor.
But Inspector Connors says enforcement of the new law has been spotty, mainly because of its complexity. And domestic violence arrests keep flooding -- some say clogging -- the courts. The Office of Court Administration estimates that one-fifth of all Criminal Court cases in the city are domestic violence cases, and the executive director of Brooklyn Defender Services, Lisa Schreibersdorf, said such cases made up 20 to 30 percent of her lawyers' work. She argues, and some victims' advocates agree, that the number of complaints makes it easier for the most serious cases to slip through the system. With so many misdemeanors, Ms. Rogowsky said, "It's so hard to focus on any one case the way you can in the felony part."
 
Courts Offer Victims Advocates and Services
A few years ago, New York's court system, recognizing the unique, volatile nature of domestic violence cases, began setting up specialized sections that handle only abuse cases. The goals are to protect victims, increase defendants' accountability and speed up cases, because the longer they languish, the less likely victims are to cooperate.
Most victims of domestic violence are women, and those who do cooperate may have to uproot their lives and those of their children. Often, the abuser is the household's main wage earner, and if he's in jail there is no food on the table. The victim may have to leave her home and her job for safety's sake; her children may have to switch schools.
Domestic violence courts, therefore, have begun assigning each victim an advocate and offering access to an array of social services. "We have to supplant someone's most intimate partner," Judge Judith S. Kaye, Chief Judge of the State Court of Appeals, said last week in an interview after the opening of a full-service three-part domestic violence criminal court in the Bronx, the first of its kind in the city. "We're saying, 'Don't trust him, trust us.' It's essential to build confidence."
State officials say they hope to open courts similar to the one in the Bronx, which hears misdemeanor cases, in all boroughs. Other areas have Criminal Court parts, but not full courts, dealing with domestic abuse.
Only Brooklyn has a domestic violence court that hears felonies exclusively. Opened two years ago, it is widely regarded as a model. The presiding judge, John M. Leventhal, is a mathematics teacher-turned-lawyer who was elected to the State Supreme Court in 1994. Judge Matthew D'Emic presides over a recently opened second section.
In Judge Leventhal's courtroom, emotions run high, truth can be elusive and the threat of violence seems to lurk around every corner. At a recent hearing, a prosecutor played a 911 tape of a woman reporting an assault. She was weeping, struggling for breath.
Then it was the defense lawyer's turn. "I've heard the tape, Your Honor. I've heard the woman allegedly sobbing on the tape. A person who wants to make a false report would do that, weeping into the phone. I don't think it's the spontaneous utterances of a woman who's scared."
Judge Leventhal must sort out the legal doctrines surrounding the tape's admissibility, but he must keep in mind the common history, including a young child, of the defendant and the victim. He must protect the rights of the defendant, while doing all he can to safeguard the life of the victim.
Judge Leventhal hectors, lectures, harangues and occasionally threatens the defendants who appear before him. ("Stop blaming everyone else. Start looking in the mirror.") And as a condition of bail -- before a plea bargain or trial -- he often sends them to programs for batterers or drug or alcohol abusers. After bail is set, he requires them to report to him every two or three weeks, and every two to three months while on probation. The judge's philosophy is simple: intense judicial supervision is the best way to deter repeat battering. "They need to know they're being watched," he says.
On a recent Wednesday, the judge ordered a man on bail back to jail after a prosecutor said the woman who had filed the complaint that led to his original arrest was accusing him of threatening her again. The woman was not in court; she could not be cross-examined.
Such decisions prompt claims from defense lawyers that Judge Leventhal's approach is unfair to defendants. "There's a real presumption of guilt," Ms. Schreibersdorf, of Brooklyn Defender Services, says.
The judge is aware of that perception and does not hesitate to address it. "I am impartial," he says, "but I have to shield the complainant."
He is acutely aware that his actions may defuse a problem or explode it. Will sending a man back to jail protect a woman now but endanger her later? "Thank God, we haven't lost anyone," he says, but the fear haunts him. "Vacations, weekends, you can't get away," he says. "You watch the news. Is it Brooklyn, is it my case, did I let him out?"
Ms. Schreibersdorf says the judge calls one of her clients "at home every weekend" to let him know someone's looking over his shoulder. "I admire him for doing it, but he can't keep it up at this pace," she said. "He's taking it to heart in every single case."
It is too early for any hard conclusions, but statistics show that in Judge Leventhal's court there are half the number of probation violations as in other courts that handle similar cases. As of the end of 1997, there were only three outstanding warrants, lower than in any other Brooklyn felony court.
Lisa Smith, a Brooklyn Law School professor who is the borough's deputy district attorney for domestic violence, sees this as proof that new ideas can work on an old problem. But, she says, "It is slow, labor-intensive, a resource drain -- everything no one in the criminal-justice system wants."
The office of the Brooklyn District Attorney, Charles Hynes, has assembled the city's largest team of domestic violence prosecutors -- around 35 -- partly because the borough has the most cases. It also pursues a controversial policy, which some other district attorneys are slowly adopting, of prosecuting abuse cases even without the victim's cooperation.
Judge Leventhal said 30 to 40 percent of the victims in his court recant their accounts regardless of their veracity. And Ms. Smith tells of a women hit by five bullets, and another with hundreds of stitches, refusing to press charges against their partners and abusers. In one case, she said, a woman beaten by a recently paroled murderer refused to prosecute. "We have to intervene," she added, going so far as to subpoena some victims who were reluctant to testify.
But defense lawyers and some judges argue that going against a victim's wishes is another way of victimizing her, reinforcing her powerlessness. Chief Judge Kaye said that approach "sometimes is just another instance of a loss of control" for a victim.
Judge Leventhal's court may be attracting attention, but as a felony court it hears only a small portion of Brooklyn's domestic violence cases. Most are heard in Criminal Court, where judges and prosecutors have less time, and fewer options, in dealing with domestic violence. Under state law, a misdemeanor case cannot go forward unless the victim signs a corroborating affidavit and agrees to testify if there is a trial.
Prosecutors in Brooklyn try to persuade unwilling victims to change their minds, and they may hold cases for the 90-day maximum allowed by law in the hope of such a turnaround. But 50 percent of misdemeanor cases are dropped because the victims will not cooperate.
On a recent Wednesday, three men sat scowling in a misdemeanor courtroom in Brooklyn used for domestic violence cases. All three said their wives or girlfriends did not want to press charges but were being pressured to by prosecutors. Ricardo, who would give no last name, said that he had been charged in two incidents but that his wife had bailed him out. "She needs me to pay the rent," he said. "She earns pennies."
 
Orders of Protection Go Only So Far
When there is no hope of prosecution, and even when there is, judges routinely use a weapon that in many cases has had limited effect: the order of protection. Such orders can bar a defendant from contact with a victim or let a couple live together as long as no abuse occurs. Since 1996, it has been a felony to violate a protection order when there is a prior violation within five years. Still, judges say, there is little they can do to guarantee that they are obeyed.
Samuel Tolliver had an arrest record dating to 1964, and those who knew him said he did not fear jail much. In March, he was arrested on charges that he hit Ms. Chambers in the face with a dinner plate, cutting her eye. Unlike so many times in the past, she agreed to press charges. Mr. Tolliver pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and was sentenced to 60 days in jail and 34 months' probation. When he was released, Judge Lee Cross ordered him to stay away from Ms. Chambers for three years and to enter an alcohol treatment program.
Mr. Tolliver drank heavily, and Ms. Chambers often drank with him, a common phenomenon, says Kadhija Shepard, a Victim Services counselor who works with residents in eastern Brooklyn's housing projects. "They enable each other; it's a commonality: 'We drink together, have kids together.' " Alcohol does not cause the rage that drives domestic violence, experts say, but it can unleash it.
The couple met a decade ago, and the abuse apparently began not long after. The first of many incidents recorded by the Housing Authority was in 1990, when records show Mr. Tolliver cut her with a knife.
The authority is another agency that is taking domestic abuse more seriously; last year it offered confidential emergency transfers to 520 victims. But a spokesman, Hilly Gross, said many offers were declined. An agency official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Ms. Chambers turned down a transfer offer as well as referrals to counselors. And when officials tried to evict Mr. Tolliver, she let him back in.
She feared him, friends, relatives and co-workers said. And "she was crazy about him," said her mother, Beulah Brown. They had two children together. Mr. Tolliver counted on her welfare income for sustenance and her apartment for shelter.
Last New Year's Eve, Mr. Tolliver menaced Ms. Chambers with a knife, and a neighbor called 911. Soon after, the city placed their two young children with Ms. Chambers's sister. Ms. Chambers was devastated. "She cried like a baby," one neighbor said.
But her colleagues at the Atlantic Senior Center, where she had worked as an aide since October, were trying to bolster her self-esteem, telling her she would be better off without her boyfriend. Her supervisor, who asked not to be identified, noticed a change: she was drinking less, dressing better. Her outlook was brighter.
Mr. Tolliver, meanwhile, seemed to be spiraling out of control. "He was just completely gone," Ms. Chambers's mother said, "drinking, cursing, fighting." He slept all day, she said, and drank at night, awakening her daughter to beat her.
Just after Mr. Tolliver was sent to jail for the assault with the plate, Ms. Chambers had a temporary relapse, but then seemed to thrive on his absence. "When he was taken out of her life, she was even happier," her supervisor said. "She was a totally different person."
The woman everyone called Smiley was with a new boyfriend on the day Samuel Tolliver came looking for her and his shirts. "I think he was devastated that she didn't need him," her supervisor said. "Seeing her looking glamorous and happy, plus she had gotten him in trouble."
Her mother said the same thing: "She was determined in the end not to take him back. I think he sensed that he would lose everything."
But instead of calling the police when she saw Mr. Tolliver, Ms. Chambers went to her apartment and brought his shirts to the lobby. "There are things the system is incapable of doing," said a spokesman for the Office of Court Administration, David Bookstaver. "We cannot stop people from violating their own orders of protection."
The system is also incapable of identifying lethal batterers. Homicides are rare in domestic violence cases, experts say. They are also frighteningly unpredictable. A serious history of violence in a relationship does not necessarily mean it will turn deadly. But as Karan Chambers's case showed, it may.
"Why did God take her away?" Ms. Chambers's supervisor asked. "Not God, actually. Samuel."

HEADLINE: Pieces of Advice for Japan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
Back in the 1980's, Japan was full of advice for the United States: Clean up the Federal deficit, a drag on the world economy. End consumers' addiction to credit cards. Try a little lean production in Detroit. Adopt strict gun-control laws. Make sure that every student can read. Let workers feel that they are part of the company, not just hired help. Oh, and start a bullet train between Boston and Washington.
 Most of these ideas were pretty good, even if Americans bristled at being lectured by the new titan of the world economy. 
 But now an economic reckoning has come to Japan and it seems only fair to return the favor with a few modest suggestions from America that might help revive the ailing giant of Asia.
 
Give the Yankees A New Home: Osaka
It's not as crazy as it sounds. George Steinbrenner wants a new stadium, but New York taxpayers can think of better things to do with their money. Japan, on the other hand, has just appropriated trillions of yen for public works to bolster the economy -- and is having a hard time coming up with something interesting to spend it on.
 But there is a more serious reason for moving the House That Ruth Built to the country that the Babe wowed during a 1934 tour. Japanese baseball has become a symbol of what's wrong with the Japanese economy: precisely controlled competition. Each team is limited to two foreign players, to keep the game from losing its distinctive Japanese flavor. Corporate Japan doesn't have the two-player rule, but it acts as though it does.
If the Yankees move to Japan's industrial heart, the closed market of Japanese baseball will be forever opened. Suddenly, teams around Japan will have to compete for the best global players they can find. Japanese fans will watch more home runs blasted out of the park. And the teams that can't stand the heat -- well, they may be busted to the minor leagues. That's capitalism.
Some other benefits: Mr. Steinbrenner becomes some other city's problem. Hideki Irabu, Japan's greatest export in recent years, might feel more at home -- the rest of the team will require simultaneous translation. And if you are a Red Sox fan, tired of looking up at the Yankees in the American League standings, it's a win-win situation -- all in the name of helping a great ally out of a tight spot.
 
Swap Cabbies With New York
For years, Japan and the United States have organized reciprocal visits by lawmakers. The Americans arrive in Tokyo, enjoy kaiseki feasts at the finest restaurants, hold news conferences to complain about trade barriers ("Good progress, but there's a lot of work to be done") and fly home without having changed anyone's mind in Japan. A few months later, leaders of the Japanese Diet arrive in Washington, chain-smoke through endless meals at the Watergate Hotel and go home convinced that the Americans will never understand them.
To really alter attitudes, how about trading taxi drivers instead? Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York would love it: Tokyo's cabbies wear white gloves, keep their cars pristine and navigate seamlessly through one of the world's most complicated cities. But the real benefit would go to Japan. After decades of "internationalization," the country is still far from what you might call a melting pot. Immigration is, um, frowned upon. And while this attitude creates a more cohesive society, it deprives Japan of the energy and entrepreneurship that populates labs in Silicon Valley -- and driver's seats in New York.
Without flying anywhere, Japanse citizens could get a crash course in multiculturalism. No doubt, there would be some culture clash when an inebriated Japanese salaryman gets into a cab in the downtown Ginza district at midnight and tries to give directions to his house in Yokohama to a new arrival with minimal Japanese language skills. But it would globalize Japan real fast.

Invite Gates-san To Endow a Chair
In the 80's, Japanese companies couldn't spend enough money on American campuses. They endowed chairs at Harvard and M.I.T., and paid for research projects at Stanford. The donations improved their image in the United States and gave the Japanese a window into the breeding grounds for some of America's most innovative technologies.
Japanese universities, meanwhile, were starving. They got little support from Japanese businesses, which would rather train researchers themselves.
In the early 90's, the president of one of Japan's leading research universities said, appeals for money for modern laboratories were regularly turned down by Japanese executives.
Now it is time for Japanese schools to solicit help from Silicon Valley. For example, they could establish the William H. Gates chair to infuse risk-averse Japanese students with a little Microsoft mythology.
In return for endowing the chairs, American companies would be offered the first crack at hiring Japan's best and brightest, before they disappeared into the bowels of Hitachi and Toshiba. And there's one more advantage for Mr. Gates: The Japanese are not known for breaking up monopolies.
 
How About Trying Credit Card Debt?
What do Americans have in abundance that we would be happy to share? All those letters from credit card companies declaring that we've just been pre-approved for a card we never requested. Why not take them off our hands?
Japan is suffering a credit crunch that is killing the economy. In the 80's and early 90's, banks lent money to anyone who walked in the door. They felt flush because real estate prices were sky high -- and real estate on a crowded island never goes down, right? -- and because banks in Japan were (and still are) allowed to count stock holdings as part of their capital. Every jump in stock prices meant that the banks could lend even more.
Then the triple whammy hit. Land prices crashed. So did the stock market. And then many of the banks' borrowers -- small businesses, gangsters, property developers -- announced that they couldn't pay. So now, saddled with $600 billion in bad debts, the banks simply won't lend. Sure, interest rates are ridiculously low, but try getting a loan.
Of course, no new credit means little new business activity, which sends the stock market lower, which pushes the banks even closer to the brink.
The Japanese Government promised last week to get serious about cleaning up the banking mess, but it has said that before. In the meantime, Japan needs credit. Lots of it. Take that junk mail -- please.
 
Scrap the Yen. Spend Tamagotchi.
The big problem in Japan these days is that no one is spending any money. Ordinary folks don't trust the banks, so they are stuffing cash under the futon. Whenever they are tempted to buy something, the Government warns that the population is aging quickly, so people have to save, save, save for retirement.
The solution lies in Japanese technology: the tamagotchi, that annoying little electronic chicken that needs to be fed, stroked and cared for every few hours or it dies. For a few years now, it has driven parents in Japan -- and then in America -- to distraction, as their children weep over the loss of the E-chick.
How about harnessing the invention to a greater purpose? Tuck a tamagotchi chip into every 10,000-yen bill. If it sits in a dark pocket without changing hands for more than a day, it turns to dust. But pass it around -- buy a computer, spend an evening in a karaoke bar -- and it chirps with contentment.
 
Sell an Island To the Taiwanese
When Japan was booming, it spread its wealth. The rich and the not-quite-rich bought condominiums in Honolulu and Maui. They flocked to Guam and to Port Douglas, the Australian resort village near the Great Barrier Reef. Local shops responded, posting signs in Japanese and hiring Japanese speakers to serve their new patrons. Some locals complained at the time about the influx, but these days Hawaiians and Australians alike talk wistfully about the days when 747's landed every hour, full of Japanese travelers eager to snap up souvenirs and real estate.
Now, with the yen melting down, the dollar reigning supreme and Japanese property prices collapsing, Japan can reverse the tide. This is the best moment in 30 years for Japan to lure investors from abroad.
Hokkaido would be a good place to start. Japan's northernmost island is beautiful, thinly populated and home to Japan's best ski slopes. Why not build spectacular ski chalets to suit the tastes of wealthy Taiwanese, who have no place to ski on their hot, flat island? It would create jobs in one of Japan's most depressed corners.
Politically savvy developers could also market the chalets as a hedge against a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, especially if America's military commitments to the island prove a bit iffy.
There is no reason to stop at Hokkaido. Why not get cities across Japan into a bidding war to attract the Big Three to buy or build car factories, the way Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky vied for Nissan, Honda and Toyota? Time to roll out those tax breaks.
After all, according to Nicholas R. Lardy, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, there has been more foreign direct investment in China in the last few years than there has been in Japan since the end of World War II.
 
Borrow a Chapter From Al and T. Boone
So maybe Albert J. Dunlap, lately downsized before he could get around to dismissing still more employees at the Sunbeam Corporation, isn't exactly a poster child for American-style capitalism.
But if ever there was a country that needs to learn the meaning of the term "shareholder value," it is Japan. So a touch of Chain Saw Al's approach -- getting companies into fighting trim -- might do wonders at bloated concerns like Japan Airlines.
The Japanese are not likely to warm up to some of Chain Saw Al's ideas any more readily than Americans have, but they just might develop a new appreciation of the need to produce profits and returns for shareholders. After all, the old Japanese commitment to lifetime employment is breaking down anyway, and Japan's jobless rate, now more than 4 percent, rivals America's.
And what about bringing back T. Boone Pickens? The self-promoting Texas oilman made a splash in Japan in the early 1990's when he took a big stake in a Japanese car-parts manufacturer, and then had the nerve to show up at shareholder meetings and ask embarrassing questions about how the company was run.
It was quite a show. First he was booed. Then he was accused of acting as a front for a Japanese shakedown artist. Finally he was bought out.
Mr. Pickens was probably ahead of his time. Now some Japanese realize that the ingrown system he was challenging -- the Japanese keiretsu system, in which companies hold stakes in one another but also hide one another's weaknesses -- allows managers to run amok.
There is a nascent movement to let investors actually learn something about how their companies are run, as long as they don't get too nosy. So how about sending a delegation from the Keidanren, Japan's biggest business organization, to tell Mr. Pickens that all is forgiven?
 
Take Homespun Hints From Beardstown
Japanese women have always been among the country's most active investors. With husbands working all day, the securities houses used to hunt for customers by setting up shop in department stores. But the days of watching the cash pour in are long, long gone.
How about calling in the Beardstown Ladies, the grandmotherly stock sharks of rural Illinois? Nothing sells better in Japan than products that sniff of down-home American culture: blue jeans, Elvis, New England quilts. So the ladies can push their no-nonsense, look-for-long-term-value brand of stock-picking. It shouldn't be hard to beat Nomura Securities, the Japanese brokerage giant, given its track record for the last seven years.
Of course, the ladies' reputation was tainted a touch recently, when it was determined that they had inflated their returns by counting their monthly dues as profits. They say it was an innocent mistake. But even this can be spun to advantage. The ladies can argue that they were simply getting accustomed to Japanese accounting standards.
 
Call In Your Pals From the C.I.A.
Forty years ago, when the greatest threat facing Japan and America was Communism, the Central Intelligence Agency secretly funneled millions of dollars to support the conservative party that has dominated Japan for four decades -- the ill-named Liberal Democratic Party.
This was one of the agency's few covert operations that worked too well. The party's politicians who were begging the agency for money in the 50's told American trade negotiators to take a hike in the 80's. And Japan's opposition parties, fragmented and disorganized, have not been able to spur any real political debate in Japan over how to manage the economy.
So how about re-invigorating the huge C.I.A. station inside the American Embassy in Tokyo? Call it Operation Rising Yen. The spooks could bombard Japanese voters with propaganda promoting Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin's vision of a Japan that throws itself open to competition, spurs the economy without inflating the trade deficit and solves its banking crisis.
They could plant guests on the Sunday morning talk shows, advocating radical ideas like actually closing institutions that are bankrupt.
Sure, it's meddling in another country's politics, but that has rarely stopped the agency before. And if Congress won't pay for it, maybe the Chinese will. After all, they suddenly seem interested in contributing to political causes abroad -- and they have as much to lose as America does if Japan buckles.
 
Create the Sequel 'Godzilla vs. M.O.F.'
Ever since Japan turned out its 1954 classic "Godzilla, King of the Monsters," the world's favorite destroyer of cities has symbolized the various threats facing the country. The first Godzilla movie was a protest against American nuclear tests in the Pacific. In the 1960's, Godzilla's struggles with King Kong were a stand-in for the cold-war battles between the United States and the Soviet Union, with Japan caught in the crossfire. The latest movie, written by Americans for the Japanese-owned Sony studios, sends the monster rampaging through Times Square.
Many Japanese people now believe the country's biggest threat comes from within -- specifically, from the Ministry of Finance. After all, its powerful bureaucracy forced a misconceived tax increase last year -- raising the country's consumption tax from 3 percent to 5 percent -- which many now blame for plunging the country into recession. Its top leaders enjoyed long, expensive nights at "hostess bars" with the financial executives it was supposed to be regulating, one reason the country now finds itself in dire straits. And it is M.O.F., as the ministry is known, that has dragged its feet in closing down failed banks and deregulating the financial markets.
Many in Japan have called for the breakup of the ministry. But taking on the most powerful bureaucrats in Tokyo is no job for mere mortals.
So in the spirit of those anti-nuclear protests of the 50's, Godzilla's powerful tail and fiery breath could be turned on the ministry's impregnable headquarters in downtown Tokyo. It's unclear whether he could persuade the bureaucrats to take some painful steps to get the economy moving again. But it might be fun to watch him try.

HEADLINE: The World: What Went Wrong?;
Mexico Can't Fathom Its Rising Crime

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
NOT so long ago, Mexico seemed a reasonably safe place, especially when compared with Latin American societies in the throes of civil war or paramilitary violence. But that's changed. Now virtually every day, terrifying new crimes dramatize the country's public security crisis.
Just in recent weeks, a Vermont artist was knifed to death on a Pacific Coast beach. A kidnapper called a Mexico City newspaper to boast about hacking off the ears of his hostages and to jeer at the authorities' inability to stop him. Military police officers ordered to investigate the disappearance of scores of people in a city on the Texas border were themselves arrested collecting a kidnapping ransom. The State Department has cautioned visiting Americans about the rising crime rates. 
 Mexican criminologists, sociologists and others are debating what's gone wrong. How did one of the safest countries in the hemisphere become a place where tourists are panicking and millions fear criminal attack whenever they leave home?
Some blame the economy, which for 15 years has seen real wages fall and the breach between rich and poor widen. Some cite sociology, saying that an entire generation of police officers are now using their violent skills as participants in organized crime. Others trace the crisis to the justice system, which is so discredited that most crimes go unreported, fewer are investigated, and only a tiny fraction of the perpetrators are ever punished. Some even blame the growth of democracy, which by stripping Mexico's ruling party of many of its authoritarian powers has also diminished its ability to repress crime.
One thing is common to all these explanations. There is a sense that Mexico's top civilian authorities have lost control of the country's criminals, who now see lucrative opportunities on all sides.
"In practical terms, the Mexican state simply doesn't respond to most crimes," said Ernesto Lopez Portillo, co-author of a 1994 study of public security issues. "The authorities refuse to recognize the severity of the public security crisis, partly because it's so frightening."
The facts are sobering. Although record-keeping is chaotic, and fear of the police keeps many victims from reporting crimes, government statistics for Mexico City show that reported murders rose by 50 percent from 1990 to 1995 and that robbery incidents have multiplied six-fold in 15 years. Experts estimate that kidnappings in Mexico, once rare, now number at least 1,500 a year.
Rafael Ruiz Harrell, a professor who is one of Mexico's most meticulous crime statisticians, has charted annual figures for all reported crimes since 1930 and concluded: "There's a clear association between economic crisis and crime."
For 50 years after 1930, Mexican workers enjoyed an almost uninterrupted rise in their standard of living, and in those years, he says, crime declined with equal constancy, even though Mexican wages remained far below the standard in the United States. But beginning in 1983, the first year after an economic crisis sent wages into free-fall, crime rates took off, and they have yet to level out. In 1995, the year following a disastrous peso devaluation, reported crimes in Mexico surged 35 percent, he said.
"Never before in our history has crime grown this rapidly," Mr. Ruiz said. "The figures speak for themselves."
Economic determinism has its critics, however, including President Ernesto Zedillo. In an appearance this month in New York, Mr. Zedillo said that attributing street crime to economic factors amounts to blaming the poor. Instead, he said, the problem lies with the "inefficiency" of Mexico's crime-fighting institutions.
How do inefficient police and prosecutors translate into more crime? "Potential criminals act rationally and base their decision to commit a crime on an analysis of costs and benefits," said a recent World Bank study of crime in Latin America. Potential criminals, it said, estimate the payoff of a crime, the costs associated with committing it, and the probability of punishment.
Those who apply this calculus in Mexico see that crimes like kidnapping and drug trafficking have proven extremely lucrative in recent years, and punishment is rare.
 
Career Opportunities
"In Mexico as elsewhere, crime is a career option that competes with others," said Mr. Lopez. Many Mexicans are turning to crime because punishment is remote. The criminal justice system is chaotic; the country has had seven attorneys general in nine years, and turnover among lower officials is higher. Given the disorder, Mr. Lopez estimated that of each 100 crimes reported to authorities, only five are investigated.
But Mexico's justice system has never worked efficiently, so why is crime surging now? Until recently, Mr. Lopez said, government officials from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the P.R.I., controlled the criminal class, often favoring one mafia in exchange for kickbacks while suppressing rival groups and never allowing crime to surpass certain bounds. But as the P.R.I. has begun to share power it has lost control of the criminals, he said.
"The old rules no longer apply and new ones haven't emerged," he said.
Lucio Mendoza, a former analyst at the national security agency who now runs a research organization, said the authorities have not only lost control but that members of the police are now the main organizers of crime. Starting in the late 1960's, he said, successive presidents gave the police, especially members of an elite corps known as the Federal Security Directorate, license to eliminate accused subversives by whatever means they felt necessary. By the early 1980's guerrillas had been suppressed, and the police turned their extralegal skills to organized crime. "It was like a cancer that expanded," Mr. Mendoza said. "They went into drugs, car theft, kidnaps, piracy, truck hijackings. This is the cause of the crime rates we see today."
In a recent newsletter, Mr. Mendoza cited 39 articles published in major Mexican newspapers between May 22 and June 9, each detailing spectacular police criminality. One said Mexico City police officers, using a government computer, were identifying and then threatening citizens who report crime. Another reported the arrest of 11 police officers who were trafficking in migrant workers in the state of Veracruz. Another said a federal agent had organized a prison break in the state of Tamaulipas, which borders Texas.
If the hypotheses put forward to explain the crime surge are tidy, criminality is complex, and what seems to make sense in one place may not in another.
Homicide, for instance, has jumped dramatically in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, cities that are the main border drug corridors; organized crime is clearly at work there. Murder is also rampant in the Mexico City suburbs, where the newly rich are building luxury residences alongside slums. There, some believe that growing economic inequality is the cause, since, as the criminologist Lawrence Sherman of the University of Maryland says, "Inequality is a major predictor of homicide."
Some crimes and the investigations of them become so byzantine that they support various hypotheses. One such case was the murder of a senior banking executive, found dead in his car last August. Because his watch was missing, the authorities said he had been killed during a robbery; the economic crisis seemed to blame.
But then, as the case dragged on, new factors seemed to be at play. No arrests were made in this prominent case for 10 months; this demonstrated anew to millions of Mexicans that crime does indeed pay and added weight to the theory that lawlessness is surging because few crimes are punished. Then developments supported those who put police depradations at center stage.
Early this month, the police charged a 28-year-old laborer, Sergio Diaz, with the murder. But then chagrined prosecutors released him, based on his bizarre story. He said the police officers who arrested him had kidnapped him last year, holding him until his family paid a $9,000 ransom. But Mr. Diaz had dared to file kidnapping charges, and several officers were eventually arrested, though quickly released. They set about getting even, and eventually framed him on the murder charges. Prosecutors concluded that Mr. Diaz had nothing to do with the murder. The police have not been punished.
Citizen protests over many similar outrages appear to have gotten the Government's attention. On June 12, Interior Minister Francisco Labastida announced a bigger crime budget.
But critics say anti-crime efforts are still moving slowly. One example: In the mid-1980's, the Government promised to compile a single, computerized file of information on all Mexican police officers, thus helping the authorities to avoid hiring criminals. Three presidencies and nearly 15 years later, the list is still incomplete; now Mr. Zedillo's aides are promising to finish it.
When will the registry be done, an Interior Ministry official was asked.
"I wouldn't want to give a date," he said.

The Presidential Pen Is Still Mighty

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BILL CLINTON is often perceived as a weak President a lame duck dogged by scandal, thwarted at many turns by a hostile Republican Congress. His campaign for tobacco-control legislation foundered this month in the Senate. To top it off, the Supreme Court last week denied him the power to kill specific items in tax and spending bills by line item veto.
But the perception of weakness is belied by a largely unnoticed reality. Mr. Clinton is continually stretching his executive and regulatory authority to put his stamp on policy. He has issued a blizzard of executive orders, regulations, proclamations and other decrees to achieve his goals, with or without the blessing of Congress. 
 In the summer of 1995, Mr. Clinton authorized the Food and Drug Administration to declare nicotine an addictive drug, clearing the way for the most significant Government regulations in the history of the tobacco industry.
Last week, after the Senate killed a big anti-tobacco bill, Mr. Clinton ordered a survey of cigarette smoking among teen-agers as a way to identify those who market most effectively to underage smokers. Such market research was a key part of the bill that died in the Senate.
On a separate issue, Mr. Clinton last week ordered sweeping new protections for Medicare beneficiaries. The rules not only carry out a 1997 law, but go beyond it, adding many of the safeguards proposed by a Presidential advisory commission -- for women, for people with serious illnesses and for patients who cannot speak English.
His critics say Mr. Clinton is legislating from the executive branch, often in defiance of Congress. His supporters say he is prodding, circumventing or overriding a do-nothing Congress that refuses to address the nation's major problems.
Of course, Presidents have used executive orders to work their will since the earliest days of the Republic, with the boldest actions coming in times of crisis. Lincoln freed the slaves by proclamation. Franklin D. Roosevelt created new agencies and placed Japanese-Americans in detention camps by executive order. President Clinton's more modest agenda is more suited to a time of peace and prosperity. A self-declared policy wonk, he is passionately interested in details of health, education and welfare programs that touch the lives of millions.
Critics say many of his initiatives are small-bore. Yet while ridiculing or denouncing some of them, Congress acquiesces in others to avoid tough decisions.
To some, this raises separation-of-powers concerns echoing those posed by the 1996 Line Item Veto Act, which was enacted in part to give members of Congress political cover by allowing the President to kill pork-barrel spending. The Supreme Court struck down the statute last week, saying it violated the procedures set forth in the Constitution for making law.
Jeremy C. Taylor, director of natural resource studies at the Cato Institute, says legislative authority has been ceded improperly to the executive branch in other ways. "This President distinguishes himself from past Presidents by the aggressiveness with which he has expanded his authority without explicit Congressional approval," Mr. Taylor said. "The main culprit is Congress, for letting the President get away with this, and for delegating vague and broad discretionary powers to the Executive in the first place."
In a recent speech, Mr. Taylor cited as one example telecommunications legislation mandating that the poor have access to the Internet and other forms of communication. He said Congress left the pesky details to the Federal Communications Commission, and when the F.C.C. came back to Congress, since someone had to pay for such "universal access," legislators were "shocked, shocked" at the agency's proposal for a new tax on business.
 
Moving Boldly
Sometimes Mr. Clinton boldly carries off his novel use of Presidential power, as when he tapped a special Treasury fund to bail out Mexico in 1995, over the objections of Congress. And sometimes he does not.
In March 1995, Mr. Clinton issued an executive order that barred Federal agencies from signing contracts with companies that permanently replaced striking workers. He said he was simply exercising his power to set procurement policy for the Government.
But the United States Chamber of Commerce denounced the executive order as a "political payoff" to organized labor, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck it down, saying the President could not unilaterally "alter the delicate balance of bargaining and economic power" set by Congress in the National Labor Relations Act.
In the realm of foreign affairs and national security, Mr. Clinton takes "an expansive view of Presidential power over military initiatives," said Louis Fisher, an expert on constitutional law at the Congressional Research Service. Citing actions ordered by the President in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Iraq, Mr. Fisher said that "Mr. Clinton's interpretation of Presidential war power would have astonished the framers of the Constitution." Congress has substantial authority over foreign affairs, Mr. Fisher said, but in recent decades it "has failed to protect its prerogatives."
Mr. Clinton has also stretched his appointment power. After the Senate blocked the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to run the civil rights division of the Justice Department, Mr. Clinton defiantly named him Acting Assistant Attorney General last December.
Lawyers at the Congressional Research Service say this designation appears to violate an 1868 law, the Vacancies Act, which in its current form sets a 120-day limit on such temporary appointments. The Administration disagrees.
But Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, said the Administration was flouting the law by using temporary appointments to fill 18 percent of the 320 positions subject to Senate confirmation at various departments. Without the 120-day limit, Mr. Byrd said, "no President need ever forward a nomination to the Senate."
One of Mr. Clinton's most spectacular unilateral actions came in 1996, on the rim of the Grand Canyon, when he designated 1.7 million acres of Utah's red rock country a national monument. The step outraged Utah officials and many members of Congress, in part because it limits development of the land. But Congress failed to overturn the designation. And the rugged beauty of the area has become a tourist attraction, as well as a monument to Presidential power.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AT&T in Deal for TCI
In a merger that is expected to change the way consumers buy and use communications services, AT&T agreed to acquire Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 cable television provider, for $31.8 billion in stock. C. Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief executive of AT&T, left, and John C. Malone, chairman of TCI, said they wanted to market the companies' services jointly as soon as possible, selling digital phone and data services over the cable system. . . . The European Union approved Worldcom's $43.7 billion deal for MCI, and American regulators are expected to back it soon. To win European approval, MCI agreed to sell its Internet business. Analysts said Britain's Cable and Wireless was the likely buyer. 

MICROSOFT
Victory in Court
Shares of Microsoft soared 5.15 percent on Tuesday after a Federal appeals court overturned a lower court's order against the company, undercutting the Government's central argument in its antitrust suit. The stock ended the week at $ TK.TK. The ruling allows Microsoft to sell its computer operating software with its Internet browsing feature. Windows 98 officially went on sale last week, and even though Microsoft did not give the new operating system software the same hype and publicity it used to promote Windows 95 three years ago, the new version was snapped up by consumers like Janis Dore, left. William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman and chief executive, autographed her copy in a CompUSA store in San Francisco.
 
G.M.
A Domino Effect
With few signs that the strikes and layoffs now crippling General Motors would be settled soon, the United Automobile Workers union raised the prospect that its walkout could last into mid-August. The company called the strikes illegal and said it would seek to take the U.A.W. to speedy arbitration. Some 147,900 production workers have been idled, and the economic effects of the shutdowns have been slowly rippling across North America, hurting both big suppliers like ITT and businesses as small as workers' favorite lunch counters. Farther from home, G.M. placed a vote of confidence in China's auto market, despite Asia's slump. The company said it would invest $100 million in a joint venture with a Chinese company to make pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in Shenyang.
 
THE ECONOMY
Vigorous Growth
Businesses and consumers went on a spending spree in the first quarter, causing the economy to grow much more quickly than originally believed. The nation's gross domestic product increased at a seasonally adjusted 5.4 percent annual rate in the period, the Commerce Department reported, revising the estimate a month ago of 4.8 percent. In May, however, orders for durable goods fell 2.6 percent, to $184.3 billion, as the economic crisis in Asia reduced orders for transportation- and electronics-related goods. But no matter how strong the economy, consumers can find reason for complaint: Prices of important services like dental care, hotels and car maintenance have been climbing.
 
MARKETS
The Bull Returns
After a two-week nap, the market's bull seemed to awaken with new vigor. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed to a record at midweek, only to retreat, ending the week at 1,1TK.TK, still up TK.TK, and the Dow Jones industrial average, after crossing the 9,000 hurdle for the first time since June 10, relaxed a bit, to end the week at 8,9TK.TK, up TK.TK. Technology stocks propelled the week's gains. Analysts said the market's next direction would depend on second-quarter corporate profits.
 
TAXES
A Break for Investors
Congressional leaders agreed to give investors a break on capital gains taxes, attaching the measure to an overhaul of the I.R.S. that appears headed for speedy passage. The holding period for long-term gains -- which are taxed at a maximum of 20 percent -- would be cut to 12 months from the present 18 months. The 18-month rule, created a year ago in a compromise between Republican leaders and the Clinton Administration, greatly complicated calculations for many taxpayers. And the Senate approved a bill that would provide tax breaks for parents who save for education costs, including private-school tuition. President Clinton has said he will veto the legislation.
 
OIL
Less Production. Really?
The 11 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with Mexico and Norway, planned to cut production by 3.2 million barrels a day to reduce a global oil glut. But traders cast a jaundiced eye, noting that some OPEC members traditionally ignore their quotas, and oil prices retreated from a four-day rally, ending the week at $14.TK a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The recent drop in oil prices has prompted several oil-producing countries to borrow money and reduce social spending to make up for lost income from oil exports.
 
RETAIL
Saks on the Block
The board of Saks Holdings, the holding company for the New York-based retailer, approved a sale or merger of the 97-store chain, and retained Goldman, Sachs and Merrill Lynch to assist. Such a move would end the majority ownership by Investcorp International, the Bahrain-based investment bank, which has profited by investing in other luxury retailers like Tiffany and Gucci and selling them. Investcorp bought Saks in 1990 for $1.6 billion, and sold 20 percent of Saks to the public in 1995 for $25 a share, or $425 million. Who might buy? Saks executives? Federated or May Department Stores? Nordstrom? Harcourt General, which owns Neiman Marcus? No one knows. Nor does anyone know how much a Saks sale would bring, but $1.8 billion to $2.5 billion seems likely.
 
TECHNOLOGY
Forward and Backward
I.B.M. has begun the first large-scale production of a type of chip combining silicone and germanium that could reduce prices and improve performance and portability of cellular phones and other wireless communications. I.B.M. began research on the chips in the early 1980's for mainframe computers. . . . Paul Kocher, above, has the banks and credit-card companies that market smart cards -- credit-card sized devices that contain a tiny computer chip and can be used for storing so-called digital cash -- gnashing their teeth. His four-man consulting firm, Cryptography Research of San Francisco, has figured out how to break into the cards' digital codes. The firm is trying to warn businesses about the risks in hopes of selling them possible solutions.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Crash Course;
Learning From the Big Booms

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
SUDDENLY, these are nervous times for prosperity fans. The stock market has the jitters; after going straight up all winter it has been stuck in place since April. The Asian economic boom, another great engine of American prosperity, is over. And the nation's economy shows signs of slowing.
Is this the beginning of the end of the Soaring Nineties? Who knows? There are plenty of economic seers in the land who, convinced that Americans are more efficient and productive than ever, see the good times rolling on. 
 Even the less sanguine say this may be the seventh inning rather than the ninth. But enough warning flags are up to invite comparisons with the other great periods of prosperity in modern history, and how they ended.
What is striking is that each of them -- the Gilded Age in the late 19th century, the Roaring Twenties, the Fabulous Fifties and Sixties -- ended suddenly, and in each case the end came as a shock. The same was true of the more ambiguous period of growth that ended with the stock market crash of 1987. The warning signs were there, but they were overlooked or minimized or simply beyond anyone's power to control.
"If you stood in 1928 and tried to imagine what the next decade would be like, you would never have imagined the Great Depression, and each period of prosperity has been like that," said Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist and consultant.
The Gilded Age, for example, ended with the financial panic of 1893. A weakening American currency frightened foreign investors, particularly the British, and they pulled out their money, helping to start a four-year depression.
The Roaring Twenties crashed with the stock market in 1929, and the Great Depression followed.
The Fifties and Sixties gave way to an unlikely combination of inflation and stagnant economic growth in the 1970's that shook American confidence.
Another stock market crash, in 1987, brought the decade of greed to a humbling conclusion.
Or did it really end? The bounce-back in the 1990's, after a brief recession, brings some historians to the conclusion that the present decade is really an extension of the 1980's -- half a generation of almost unbroken prosperity, particularly for upper-income people.
"What is remarkable about this era of prosperity is how long it has lasted and how entrenched the orthodoxy of free markets has become over all these years," said Alan Brinkley, the Columbia University historian. "We are really back to an age in which the reigning ideology is very close to laissez-faire, as it was in the Gilded Age."
That is one comparison. There are others. Implicit in them is the suggestion that the current era of prosperity can be prolonged by avoiding the mistakes that ended those earlier booms. Let's see.
 
The Gilded Age Dissolves in Panic
The Gilded Age, which lasted roughly 20 years, was born in the pell-mell economic growth after the Civil War. Railroads spread across the country. Steel mills blossomed, and other industries came into being. Their owners often turned to foreigners, particularly the British, to finance the projects.
Competition and over-expansion made these new industrialists vulnerable to bankruptcy. That, in turn, made the lenders nervous. And then a conflict over the value of the nation's currency finally pushed the lenders to call in their loans, which brought on the Panic of 1893.
The value of currency has, in different ways, been a source of trouble in nearly every period of prosperity. It is an issue in the maneuvering to prevent today's prosperity from running off the rails.
When dollars are scarce, their value rises. Reflecting this higher value, interest rates rise for borrowers, and prices drop for goods and services. The money, in effect, is worth more than what it buys.
One way to limit the supply is to pull dollars out of circulation, as the Federal Reserve sometimes does now. Another is to tie the dollar to gold, the practice in the Gilded Age, before there was a central bank.
A government pledges to convert each dollar into a fixed amount of gold. Since there was not that much gold available in the Gilded Age, the Government could not print that many dollars.
Virtually every government in the late 19th century adjusted its economy to the gold standard. In America, that galled farmers. They were a big part of the population, and they were desperate. Partly because of overproduction, prices for their crops kept falling. They needed low-interest credit, plenty of it, to keep going, and because of the gold standard they could not get it. Nor could they inflate their prices. The money, in limited supply, grew in value faster than their produce. Thousands of farmers lost their land.
Their solution was silver, which was much more abundant than gold. Under pressure from the populist farmers movement, Congress in 1890 authorized the Treasury to issue dollars backed by silver as well as gold. That greatly increased the money supply and made credit available at lower rates. But the dollar lost value. A "cheap" silver dollar could be converted into just as much gold as a dollar backed by gold.
The currency, in effect, was devalued, particularly in the eyes of lenders in Britain, a country on a pure gold standard. Nervous already from various bankruptcies, they called in their dollar loans and converted them into gold -- behaving much as American and European lenders did last winter when they called in loans to South Korea and converted them back to hard currencies when that country's won fell in value.
President Grover Cleveland got the silver act repealed within months. But that did not lessen the concern that the dollar would be devalued. And as gold reserves fell below $100 million in April 1893, the panic was on.
The various players in this drama knew the potential consequences of their actions, historians explain, but given the passions and the political struggle, no one could stop the process.
That is the great lesson from the Gilded Age: the forces that unwind a prosperous era take on a life of their own. And that remains an issue over a century later, particularly in a world that still views a strong currency as a top priority.
The United States returned firmly to a gold standard only after the populist farmers' candidate, William Jennings Bryan, lost the 1896 presidential election to William McKinley. By then the depression had almost run its course. And a surge in the supply of gold, from new mines, brought relief to the farmers.
 
The Roaring Twenties End in Depression
The crash of 1929, the bursting of one of those speculative bubbles that have appeared periodically over the last three centuries, was probably inevitable. The Great Depression, however, might have been preventable. The 1987 crash demonstrated that the damage resulting from a stock market plunge can be limited. But that was by no means clear in the 1920's.
It was another decade of rapid expansion. New technologies appeared. New industries came into being. There were huge investments, eye-catching mergers and mass production of automobiles, appliances and other goods. Most significantly, millions of Americans, for the first time, participated in the stock market. The small investor had arrived.
The financial markets, in fact, were growing too rapidly for policymakers to fully grasp what was happening and develop ways to deal with the problems that would arise, notes Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley.
The necessary safeguards -- deposit insurance, bank regulation, stock trading rules, the Securities and Exchange Commission -- came only in the 1930's. But they stand today as a safety net to mitigate the damage from a market crash, and from the bankruptcies and bank failures that accompany it.
The Federal Reserve, formed in 1913, was also groping. The panic of 1893 and another in 1907 had made the need for a central bank obvious. But its role as a lender of last resort and as a supplier of cheap credit in hard times would take years to develop. That role was fully in place in 1987, on the day after the stock market crash, when Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, lowered interest rates and announced that the central bank stood ready to make credit available to keep the stock market and its players solvent.
"The Federal Reserve and its foreign counterparts were all groping in the 1920's toward an understanding of what a lender of last resort should do domestically," said Mr. Eichengreen, who is also an adviser to the International Monetary Fund. Now after the global financial crisis brought about by Asia's downfall, "We are groping toward trying to understand whether we need an international lender of last resort and, if so, how it should operate," Mr. Eichengreen added.
There was another problem pulling at the Fed after the 1929 crash, a replay of a theme that had been so important in the Panic of 1893. The Fed has been accused of responding to the crash by raising interest rates, thus restricting credit and demand in the teeth of the developing Depression -- such behavior being just the opposite of what was needed.
But in fact the Fed vacillated, lowering rates at times, and deciding only in 1931 to push them up, said Charles Calomiris, an economist at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business.
What drove the Fed was England's decision to go off the gold standard. By raising interest rates, the Fed, in effect, made the dollar more valuable, which meant that dollar holders were less likely to convert their dollars to gold and once again deplete the nation's reserve.
But the cost, once again, was a Depression.
"The commitment to the gold standard constrained how much the Fed could worry about managing -- stimulating -- demand," Mr. Calomiris said. That preference for a strong dollar may still be in play.
 
The Postwar Years
Never were two decades more prosperous in America than the 1950's and 1960's. Consumer demand, unfulfilled in the Depression and the war years, drove the economy. So did military spending. The United States became the supplier to a rebuilding world. Mass production and marketing made this the most productive era. As the nation's workers turned out more, their incomes rose. So they spent more, leaving the impression that the nation's output was limitless. It was not.
The costly Vietnam War and the Great Society programs strained the system. Prices, responding to shortages, began to rise in the late 1960's. The 1973 Arab embargo made oil prices shoot up, increasing inflation. Japan, Germany and other countries re-entered the marketplace, cutting into American sales.
That helped to reduce the rate at which the economy, productivity and incomes grew. None has ever recovered its old vigor, despite a considerable improvement in the last two years. Instead, upper-income people have been the big eneficiaries in the current era of prosperity. Corporate America, freed from many government constraints, argues that it is stronger because of the change. But whether the laissez-faire system that has emerged strengthens the nation's hand for the next crisis is anyone's guess.
The Japanese are under pressure to stimulate their economy by issuing more yen. But that weakens the yen, which creates problems for American and Asian exporters, straining these economies. What we need, Mr. Calomiris said, is a coordinated action in which the Federal Reserve agrees publicly to expand the American money supply. The goal would be to offset the Japanese action and keep currency values constant.
"Mr. Greenspan could announce no interest rate increases for six months," Mr. Calomiris said. "That would be an example of the kind of policy coordination that would be very effective."
And very uncharacteristic of the Federal Reserve.

HEADLINE: An Imperfect Market, But Beware the 'Cure'

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "The Economics of Intervention" (May 31) about Joseph E. Stiglitz, chief economist at the World Bank, and his view that markets function imperfectly, so Government and other institutions must intervene to set things right: 
 According to the article, Mr. Stiglitz thinks the success of the Chrysler bailout is the rule, not the exception. But corporations facing bankruptcy are, by definition, those with the least competitive mix of products, labor and management. We should be exceptionally careful, because bailing out failing companies incurs huge potential liabilities for the taxpayer.
It would be far more effective to overhaul insolvency laws. For example, companies living beyond their means should be required to freeze all employee compensation (including that of executives and trustees, and medical and pension benefit plans) at current levels. This would force them to shore up their balance sheets, thus insuring greater job security for employees and eliminating the potential default shouldered by creditors and taxpayers.

HEADLINE: An Imperfect Market, But Beware the 'Cure'

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Mr. Stiglitz argues that high interest rates scare capital away, instead of attracting it, in a financial crisis like that now seen in Asia. But this wrongly implies there is no solution short of a massive capital transfer. 
 High initial interest rates are intended to stabilize a currency's exchange rate. Once that is accomplished, interest rates can fall without restarting a run on the currency, as long as confidence in its future value has been re-established. Thus, high interest rates are not likely to work in isolation. Other measures that address capital flight need to be taken.
One is a tighter fiscal policy that appears unlikely to be loosened in the future, so investors believe that government will not try to inflate its problems away. Another is financial system reform -- by both bankers and regulators.
A government's reputation for acknowledging and fixing problems is crucial to re-establishing confidence.

HEADLINE: Sometimes, Autocracy Breeds Freedom

BYLINE: By Robert D. Kaplan; Robert D. Kaplan, a contributing editor at The Atlantic Monthly, is author of "The Ends of the Earth."

DATELINE: STOCKBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
As Congressional Republicans and human rights advocates deride President Clinton for visiting China, they might ask themselves the following question: since 1989, which system has improved the lives of its citizens more, China's one-party dictatorship or Russia's multiparty democracy?
Whether the measure is personal freedom or economic gain, the answer is China's dictatorship. China's rulers have overseen the formation of a capitalist society, where wealth is created at the bottom by individual entrepreneurs. A middle class of tens of millions is beginning to emerge, and along with that, personal freedoms have expanded for homosexuals, unmarried couples, young parents and entrepreneurs. 
 In Russia, parliamentary democracy has led to neo-Communism, in the form of a new oligarchic class with its own media outlets and security apparatuses, as well as crime syndicates that have plundered state assets through cronyism, bribery and intimidation. More so than China's new wealth, Russia's belongs to a corrupt, political elite in a few cities.
Although there was a decline in inflation and a return to growth last year, the Russian economy has consistently been on the brink of collapse. Throughout much of the 1990's, Russia's inflation rate galloped near 150 percent, while its gross national product declined by around 5 percent annually. In China, inflation has often remained in single digits while the gross national product has grown by as much as 13 percent annually. Despite the Asian crisis, China has come close to its goal of 8 percent economic growth this year.
Russia today recalls its medieval past, in which the Muscovite city-state weakly presides over a vast, impoverished hinterland where highwaymen often govern the roads. The former Soviet Union has become such a disaster that Eastern Europeans now speak of a "Second Iron Curtain" -- meaning a curtain of misery on their eastern frontier.
China's economic growth, meanwhile, has allowed hundreds of millions of its citizens to open bank accounts, buy books and videos, travel and, through television, join a global civilization. China's autocracy has enlarged the mundane, daily freedoms that matter most to ordinary people, even as Russia's democracy has led to near anarchy in the provinces. Whatever qualms Western investors may have about China, they pale in significance to their fears regarding Russia and many so-called democratic former Soviet republics. Indeed, China is now getting 10 times more American investment than Russia is.
This doesn't mean China is stable. Many Chinese have outgrown the authoritarian institutions that ignited the boom in the first place. Calls for political freedom to match the economic openness will undoubtedly multiply. And the economic meltdown elsewhere in Asia means that China's dictators will be unable to placate their citizenry with the same level of growth as in the past.
Ethnic unrest threatens in the westernmost province of Sinkiang, where Muslim Turkic Uighurs despise the Chinese. The economic boom has empowered regional political interests in the more prosperous south and coastal areas. Then there is the environment, whose degradation in the form of poisoned air and soil, water shortages, deforestation and acid rain has been estimated to cost China's economy the equivalent of its annual gross national product growth.
But China's volatility is the consequence of economic energy brought about by increased freedoms. Russia's volatility is caused by economic and social failure. In Russia, the infliction of a parliamentary system on a society that lacked the prerequisites for democracy -- honest bureaucracies, a middle class, a moral code -- has led to lawlessness, unpredictability and ethnic clashes.
Were China to have suddenly become a parliamentary democracy in 1989 at the time of the Tiananmen Square uprising, the average Chinese citizen would likely be worse off today, and dramatically so. Back then, with more poverty, a smaller middle class and far more ignorance about the outside world, parliamentary democracy in China would probably have ignited turmoil, particularly in areas with ethnic and regional divides.
Order would have evaporated but corruption, always a scourge in China, would not have. Foreign investment would never have materialized. It is a fact of history that modern bourgeoisies have rarely been created under democratic conditions. It is the bourgeois spirit -- more than a particular system -- that provides for stability and civil society.
The recent experiences of China and Russia show that the American definition of freedom has become narrow and abstract. The overwhelming majority of people everywhere are not obsessed with politics. They do not see freedom solely in terms of the right to vote periodically and to demonstrate and to express political views publicly. Rather, they worry about such things as finding a job and a decent place to live -- and by these measures, millions of Chinese lives have improved.
When Americans lecture the Chinese about democracy, they forget their own history. As Tocqueville wrote, the development of American democracy depended on "the practical experience, the habits, the opinions, in short . . . the customs of the Americans." He believed that the national culture led to the American system of government.
We should therefore be understanding of a culture vastly different from ours, where personal freedoms are greater than they have been in decades, and where political freedom may follow.
Recently, I visited the "Chinese market" on the outskirts of Budapest that provides cheaply priced necessities for Hungarians who cannot afford the fancier shops that have opened since the fall of Communism.
Many of the merchants are from China. They came to Hungary after the Communists in Beijing loosened travel restrictions. The liberalizing policies of a one-party state have eased the hardships of a new democracy in Central Europe. The world is full of such paradoxes -- paradoxes that President Clinton is aware of, by virtue of his trip to China.

HEADLINE: Summary of Major Actions of the 221st Session of the Legislature

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA and RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 27

 BODY:
The 221st session of the New York State Legislature ground to a close at 6:02 P.M. on June 19, not with the usual lofty declarations of achievement and unity, but with a general acknowledgment by lawmakers that, in an election year of partisan attacks and personal animus, many important issues were left unaddressed.
There were, in essence, two sessions. The first began with modest agendas but fairly high hopes, and culminated in April along with the Legislature's budget negotiations, conducted in public for the first time, and the earliest passage of a budget in five years. 
 Then came Gov. George E. Pataki's broad budget vetoes, which kicked off the second session, one of anger, recrimination and inaction.
Irate lawmakers, primarily Democrats, denied Mr. Pataki, a Republican, nearly all of his agenda for the year, including restructuring of the court system, tougher criminal justice laws, and charter schools. But the Democrats, too, were denied in their quest for more money for school construction and child care, and control over changes in the electric power industry.
After a bitter internal fight, the Democrats who control the Assembly agreed to mandatory reporting of people infected by the virus that causes AIDS and notification of their partners, something the Republicans had long sought and the Democrats had long resisted. And for the second year in a row, a constitutional amendment to allow casino gambling, supported by Mr. Pataki, died in the Senate.
In the last days of the session, several bills of broad importance were agreed on, including inspection of commercial trucks to reduce air pollution and the creation of an independent panel to arbitrate policyholders' disputes with health insurers when they are denied coverage for certain treatments.
In the Assembly, 2,245 bills were introduced, the fewest since 1944, and 1,574 were passed. In the Senate, 1,938 bills were introduced, also the fewest since 1944, and 1,394 were passed.
Just 671 bills passed both houses, the fewest in at least 88 years. Of those, the Governor has signed 111 into law and vetoed one, and the remaining 559 await his action.
The following were the major actions of the session:
 
The Budget
For the first time in history, the Senate and Assembly negotiated much of the state budget publicly, in conference committees involving dozens of legislators, rather than in secret meetings among the two legislative leaders and the Governor.
A $2 billion surplus, and the relative simplicity of having two sides to the negotiations rather than three, resulted in passage of a budget by both houses on April 14, just two weeks after the start of the fiscal year. Legislators said they were generally pleased by the process, and hoped it would become the norm.
But Mr. Pataki gave lawmakers a rude surprise, vetoing 1,300 items in the budget, eliminating $760 million in 1998-99 spending and cutting $840 million in borrowing for projects, many of them in future years.
He did not veto any of the $743 million a year in tax cuts the Legislature passed, many of them for business.
Democrats in particular took the vetoes as a declaration of war. One of the items the Governor cut, a $500 million increase in spending on school construction and repair, was their top priority for the year. Another program he eliminated, $77 million to raise the salaries of teachers in urban areas, was a favorite of the teachers' unions, which are among the Democrats' leading allies. In the last days of the session, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver sued the Governor, challenging the legality of many of the vetoes.
But even after the vetoes, the budget, at $71.4 billion, was 8.2 percent larger than the previous year's, reflecting the surge in tax revenue driven by the stock market boom.
By far the most generous increases were for education, as Mr. Pataki reversed his earlier attempts to cut school spending. The budget included an $850 million increase in basic school aid, the largest ever, to more than $11 billion, and a $100 million increase in school construction spending, to $858 million.
It also included the first year of a $3 billion capital program for the State University and City University of New York, increases in operating aid for the two systems, and tuition aid to low-income college students.
For the first time since he took office, Mr. Pataki did not try to make serious cuts in Medicaid, the biggest portion of the budget, at more than $28 billion.

HEADLINE: Unpaid Dues At the U.N. Could Cost U.S. Its Vote

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 26

 BODY:
The United States could lose its vote in the General Assembly unless it comes up with $211 million to $241 million more than it now expects to pay in United Nations dues and assessments this year, according to a new United States Government estimate.
The warning appears in a new study by the General Accounting Office on the United Nations' financial problems and the arrears owed by the United States. The study was requested by members of Congress, some of whom have expressed skepticism about how much the United States owes the United Nations. 
 The Government study gratified United Nations officials because it recognizes the financial problems created by the United States and other nations behind on their dues as well as the basic figures used by the world organization.
"The report is important for what it says," said the United Nations Under Secretary for Management, Joseph E. Connor. "And what it says is that the regular budget deficit is growing, that peacekeeping cash is declining, that the total resources available to the organization are diminishing."
Mr. Connor said the United Nations kept itself afloat by raiding its peacekeeping budget, postponing payments to troop contributors and commercial suppliers and resorting to other financially imprudent measures.
The report barely touches on the influence that the United States has lost at the United Nations by not paying its bills. Its power has not eroded in the Security Council, which is more important than the General Assembly and where the debates often entail issues of war and peace.
But at other levels, said Richard Sklar, the United States delegate responsible for reform and management issues, "our influence is plummeting through the floor every day." He said that when he proposes economies to other delegates they say: "What right do you have to talk to us? You're a deadbeat."
Primarily because of its arrears, the United States lost its seat on a key committee that advises the General Assembly on administrative and budget questions. The loss of its General Assembly vote could come in January.
The United Nations spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said members currently owe $977 million for the regular 1998 budget. The United States, as the organization's largest contributor, accounts for nearly two-thirds of the total arrears. As of June 15, the United Nations reported, the United States owed about $1.5 billion in dues and assessments. This includes $297,727,256 for the 1998 regular budget and $271,478,206 for regular budgets of prior years. The United Nations also says that the United States owes $94,953,702 for peacekeeping operations this year, and $871,412,764 for peacekeeping in previous years.
The United States says it owes the United Nations a little over $1 billion. Washington has balked at paying an expanded assessment for peacekeeping, has withheld money for some projects that it considers wasteful or biased, and disputes the amount of tax that the United Nations pays for American employees in its tax equalization program.
Article 19 of the United Nations Charter stipulates that a member nation will have no General Assembly vote if the amount it owes exceeds its contributions for the previous two years.
The General Accounting Office said projected payments by Congress this year would still leave a shortfall of $211 million to $241 million, meaning that the United States could lose its General Assembly vote in January. In fact, Congress has yet to send President Clinton legislation this year appropriating funds for the United Nations.
As of May 11, 27 United Nations members had forfeited their votes because their arrears exceeded what they paid in the previous two years. The General Assembly can allow a member to vote if failure to pay is deemed beyond its control. Comoros, Liberia and Tajikistan have such an exception.

HEADLINE: Jacob Katz, 93, Social Historian of the Jews

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Jacob Katz, an internationally known authority on the history of the Jewish people, died on May 20 in Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. He was 93.
Professor Katz, who was born in Hungary, joined the faculty of Hebrew University, in Jerusalem, in 1950 and went on to hold its Bella and Israel Unterberg Memorial Chair of Jewish Social and Educational History. From 1969 to 1972, when he retired from the university, he was its chief academic officer. 
 "He was one of this century's greatest and most influential historians of the Jews," said Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, a professor of Jewish history, culture and society at Columbia University. Professor Yerushalmi, who is also the director of Columbia's Center for Israel and Jewish Studies, said: "His work, always innovative, was of incredibly wide scope, ranging freely through medieval and modern times. No one working in Jewish history or interested in it can ignore what he achieved."
Professor Katz, an Orthodox Jew, has been called a pioneer in applying social science methods to the writing of Jewish history. As a social historian, he drew on his command of Talmudic and rabbinic sources and also used what has been called a critical openness. His book "Exclusiveness and Tolerance: Studies in Jewish-Gentile Relations in Medieval and Modern Times" (1961, Behrman) has been applauded for its openness in speaking of all aspects of that relationship, including tolerance and intolerance.
He has also been called an innovator in writing about the history of the traditional Jewish law in terms of the relationship between social realities, including political and economic developments, and the development of the law.
In the 1960's and 1970's he was a visiting professor at Harvard, Columbia and Brandeis Universities. He was also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Several of his books remain in print in the United States.
Professor Katz, who was born in Magyargencs, Hungary, pursued religious studies and was ordained a rabbi. He went to Germany and received a doctorate in social history from the University of Frankfurt in 1934. He settled in Palestine in 1936 and was a secondary school teacher and administrator before he began teaching at Hebrew University.
He is survived by his wife of 62 years, the former Gerti Birnbaum; three sons, David of Ashkelon, Israel, and Chanan and Uriel, both of Jerusalem, and 11 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Internet Is New Pet Issue in Congress

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27

 BODY:
The Internet, with its influence on everything from commerce and national security to privacy and crime, has become an issue as politically alluring to many lawmakers as cutting taxes, educating children and locking up criminals.
It seems that not a week goes by on Capitol Hill without a hearing, a meeting or a gathering about one of a bevy of Internet-related issues confronting Congress. 
 When revenue-hungry governors threatened to tax the Internet, Congress got busy drafting legislation to keep levies at bay, a bill that passed the House this week. When parents expressed fears about pedophiles stalking their children on the Internet, the House passed legislation to help prosecutors chase them down. And when Hollywood voiced deep concern about copyright piracy in cyberspace, House members began studying the question of how to protect software and movies.
Lawmakers have also grown fond of making speeches about the subject. Just listen to Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., Republican of Virginia and chairman of the Commerce Committee, who recently delivered remarks to the Computer and Communications Industry Association trade group, praising its members' ingenuity.
"The digital and information revolution in which many people in this room are front-line soldiers is truly liberating," Mr. Bliley said. "You should be proud of your contributions. So much has been done in a few short years. Congress can be proud as well, of some of the work it is doing. And since there is an election coming up, I will claim credit for most it."
Just two years ago, the term "chat room" conveyed nothing but a cozy hideaway office in the Capitol to most Senators and House members. And only 14 of them boasted Web sites.
So what changed?
Millions of voters have discovered the Internet. An estimated 23 million people in the United States now log on to the Internet, a figure that grows tremendously every day, and profits continue to skyrocket, including sales figures for goods that are bought and sold on line.
This growth dovetailed with another crucial change in the high-technology industry. Once loath to lobby Congress, executives of the industry have discovered Washington's relevance the hard way -- watching Microsoft take a pounding, for example -- and have started paying regular visits to influential members of Congress.
Two weeks ago, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, huddled with lawmakers and Justice Department officials to discuss the encryption of data on the Internet.
For politicians, a breed perpetually in search of fresh battles and causes, the Internet offers a freshly minted take on old but sprightly issues. It gives lawmakers a new theme on which to stump, one that remains virtually wide open and unmarked.
Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, has taken his opposition to gambling in the real world to the next level, gambling on line. His legislation would ban it.
Two weeks ago, Republicans and Democrats joined forces in combatting pedophiles who stalk children on line. And Senator Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana, is working to try to stamp out on-line pornography. Congress tried to do that in 1996 in its first real effort to deal with the Internet, but that law was struck down by the Supreme Court last year.
There are new issues as well. The scourge of junk E-mail, or spam, was the topic of a recent Senate subcommittee hearing at which Senator Frank H. Murkowski, an Alaska Republican and one of the more senior members of the Senate, could not help but reminisce about the old days.
"I don't know if you recall the first time I ran into Spam," he told the assembled senators and witnesses, with a chuckle. "I do. It was as a youngster during World War II. It was rationed. A can of Spam and a cigarette."
The Senate passed a plan to combat junk E-mail earlier this year. The House has not taken up the issue.
In the coming months the Senate is expected to consider the tax moratorium, children's protection and copyright privacy on the Internet.
For years, Vice President Al Gore and his Democratic allies in Congress had a near lock on the subject of cyberspace, at least in the view of most Americans. The Republicans had Speaker Newt Gingrich, who was equally smitten with high technology.
But now other Republicans have started to make in-roads on the information highway, framing themselves as natural allies of the libertarian-minded high-technology community industry, with which they share a fondness for laissez-faire governance.
Several prominent senators, including John McCain, Republican of Arizona, have taken to speaking often, and with intelligence, on the Internet's impact on society and the economy.
Lawmakers sense what pollsters know. Many of the legions of Internet devotees hopscotch just as easily from one party to another. "The real group up for grabs in the future are the libertarians," said Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, a Republican pollster who has queried lawmakers and the public about the Internet and has found a substantial rise in interest. "Some call themselves liberals and some call themselves conservatives."
Now, with both sides engaged, these cyber issues are beginning to acquire the traditional partisan gloss of election-year politics. Most recently, Republicans lashed out at the Clinton Administration when they discovered that an effort to hook up every classroom in America to the Internet, something Congress endorsed in 1996, is resulting in heftier telephone bills for some taxpayers. They have dubbed it the "Gore tax."
And it seems that not a day drifts by without someone somewhere on Capitol Hill admonishing Mr. Gore for the dreaded year 2000 problem, which is shorthand for the devastating consequences that could be suffered if computers are not reprogrammed to recognize 00 as 2000 instead of 1900.
More often than not, however, these cyber issues, which are mostly nonpartisan in nature, tend to draw together hostile forces. Senator John Ashcroft, Republican of Missouri and one of the most conservative members of Congress, has teamed up with Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and a longtime liberal, over the issue of data encryption. The same sort of bond was cemented between Representative Christopher Cox, a California Republican, and Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, for the moratorium on Internet taxes.
"The Internet is relatively new, and the technology has changed so rapidly that it's not in a well-worn partisan rut," said Mr. Cox, who added that he works routinely with Ira Magaziner, the Administration's Internet guru. "There isn't a partisan lock on this.'
These members have forged these alliances around a common interest: staving off regulation, a position wholeheartedly supported by the industry.
Representative Rick White, a Republican who is from Microsoft territory in Washington, describes the mission of Congress as establishing "rules of the road," a basic framework.
Mr. Leahy and the others fear that the Internet is becoming too popular a topic too quickly in Congress, and leading too often to "bumper sticker politics," especially when it comes to privacy. "Those that want short-term political gains are closing out the possibility of real long-term benefits," Mr. Leahy said.
The consensus today, Mr. White said, is "we better not move too fast." But, he added, "the pressure is continuing to build."
Sensing that pressure, the industry is also beginning to act. At the behest of lawmakers and the Administration, two industry organizations submitted plans this week to address the outcry over the violations of consumers' privacy on the Internet. Many people fear giving out their Social Security numbers on the Internet, feeling that that is like Big Brother.
But some lawmakers maintain that legislation is needed to safeguard the privacy of people who conduct business on the Internet.
In the past year, members have tried to educate themselves and each other about the Internet. For example, Representative W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, the chairman of a subcommittee, held a series of what he called "tutorials" on the impact of electronic commerce. He said that lawmakers were beginning to realize that the old legislative framework did not necessarily apply to the Internet.
"The difference today is that if you are not prepared to deal with a new paradigm of virtual stores and boundaryless commerce, where brick and mortar is not relevant, then you will be a dinosaur," Mr. Tauzin said. "We are just beginning to be prepared."

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE FIRST LADY;
Hillary Clinton Discovers How Chinese Women Fare

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 27

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton met today with some of the best and brightest of Beijing's vibrant women's movement, discussing a wide range of sometimes sensitive issues from domestic violence to unemployment to China's high rates of female suicide.
Mrs. Clinton mostly sat back and listened as the panel of seven Chinese women told of the multitude of problems women in this country still face and of their work to solve them. 
 Although many of the panelists have long been outspoken on women's issues in front of small groups, such frank discussion in a public international forum was unusual. And the light atmosphere was in marked contrast to the tension surrounding the International Women's Conference that Mrs. Clinton attended in Beijing in 1995.
The panelists included Xie Lihua, a journalist who has championed the cause of China's rural women, and Liu Bohong of the official All-China Women's Federation, who displayed the newly published Chinese translation of the American women's medical work "Our Bodies, Ourselves" (Touchstone, 1996).
At the end, a clearly appreciative Mrs. Clinton said, "I don't think I've ever been in a more lively, energetic, and informed discussion than this one today."
The panelists described the many projects under way to improve the status of women, but their remarks were filled with reminders that deep-rooted cultural discrimination persists, particularly in the countryside. Ms. Xie likes to remind people that if you knock at a door in rural China, women are likely to answer, "Nobody's home," if there are no men inside.
Three years ago, she founded the magazine Rural Women Knowing All to give women in the countryside a voice. At today's forum, she described how the magazine had published self-help articles on reproductive health, set up programs for women who are migrant workers in Beijing and helped organize small loans for women to start cottage industries.
But she and other panelists described with bittersweet smiles the biases that such women's programs must overcome.
Ge Youli of the United Nation's Development Program in Beijing told of organizing meetings in the countryside to explain loan programs for women and having only husbands turn up.
"We say 'Where are your wives?'," Ms. Ge said. "They say, 'At home cooking, of course'." She described how the men are then instructed to play a game of what Americans call "Telephone," where the first is given a message which is passed down a line of 10. By the end, she said, the message had changed. "That's why your wives should be here," she told them.
But the panelists also told of poor rural women who with the help of such loans had escaped dreary lives by setting up prosperous businesses, like tofu shops and pig farms, and of how the traditional notion that "only men are important" was changing.
Another panelist, Chen Mingxia, who is a lawyer at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, described work in educating women about their legal rights. Although China has a fairly comprehensive women's rights law on paper, discrimination against women is common in areas like hiring and allocating housing.
At Beijing's prestigious universities there is a saying to describe the hiring hierarchy on graduation: first men with a Beijing residency permit, then men without a Beijing residency permit, only then the women.
Ms. Chen described how a rural legal aid center helped a woman who wanted to divorce her abusive husband but had neither the money nor the know-how to proceed.
The panelists excitedly described a wide range of ambitious projects to improve the status of women, from Zheng Bichuan efforts to improve the high drop-out rate among rural girls to Liu Bohong's research on images of women in the media. Some are conducted under the auspices of the Chinese Government and others receive financing from foreign organizations, like the Ford Foundation.
Perhaps most revealing about how far the discussion has come since 1995 was the moment when Ms. Liu produced the bright red-covered "American Our Bodies, Ourselves," a translation project that at times had been stalled by political debates about what could and could not be said in China. No matter that the final product was missing the American edition's sections on lesbianism and masturbation or that a number of pictures were not reproduced. At last, the book was out.

HEADLINE: Chrome Spire By Chrysler To Meet Crystal By Johnson

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
Two of America's most durable 20th-century architectural icons are meeting on East 42d Street, where Philip Johnson has designed a modern companion piece to the Chrysler Building, that giddy but well-loved emblem of Jazz Age abandon and automotive supremacy.
Mr. Johnson's plans are part of a $100 million renovation of the entire block between Lexington and Third Avenues owned by Tishman Speyer Properties and the Travelers Group. The project, to begin this week, includes the landmark 76-story Chrysler Building, a 32-story annex to the east and a large parcel between them. 
 The annex, a bland white-brick box, will be enlarged and reclad with a glass facade designed by Mr. Johnson. Five small buildings in the middle of the block will be replaced by a one-story structure topped with what Mr. Johnson calls an "explosion of crystals" -- a series of glass pyramids 50 feet high.
"It will be as dramatic as the top of the building," Mr. Johnson said, referring to the chromium-plated spire with its radiant array of chevron-shaped windows, almost like the spokes of a car wheel.
Architectural features of the Chrysler Building will also be restored as part of the project. The 1.9 million-square-foot complex will be known as the Chrysler Center upon completion late next year.
"When you bring it all under one roof, figuratively speaking, you create not only an interesting place but an anchor for 42d Street," said Jerry I. Speyer, the president and chief executive of Tishman Speyer, who has also proposed a controversial renovation of Rockefeller Center and is bidding to redevelop the site of the New York Coliseum on Columbus Circle.
The likeliest user of the space under Mr. Johnson's "crystals" would be a restaurant, Mr. Speyer said. Upstairs, only office tenants need apply: The owners did not consider setting aside part of the tower as a hotel, a prospect floated last summer before Tishman Speyer took control.
Instead, Mr. Speyer said, the building is intended for "cutting-edge companies of the new millennium," in the spirit of its developer, the auto maker Walter P. Chrysler, who dedicated the tower in May 1930 as "a sound contribution to business progress."
One of countless New Yorkers who have fallen under the Chrysler Building's spell, Mr. Speyer can recall being taken by his father in the late 1940's to the old Cloud Club on the 67th floor. He was a young boy, and Chrysler was still the second-tallest building in the world. (It is now the 18th.)
"I was so infatuated looking out the windows, because it was an awesome view," Mr. Speyer said. "I remember saying, 'I never want to leave here.' "
Today, he said, he feels like "the custodian for something special." Tishman Speyer and the Travelers insurance company bought the buildings last year for about $220 million. They have a 150-year lease from the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, which owns the land under the Chrysler Building.
Although it is an esthetic trophy, the Chrysler Building has had a checkered economic history, having changed hands six times since the Chrysler family sold it in 1953. By the end of next year, the tower and annex will be about 55 percent vacant.
"It would have been easy to put on a couple of coats of paint and re-lease it," Mr. Speyer said. "But our purpose was to re-create the monumentality of what we've bought. We want to make it better without interfering with the greatness of what's there already."
For that reason, no significant alterations are planned to the original building, which was designed by William Van Alen and was briefly the tallest tower in the world, at 1,046 feet 4 3/4 inches.
"It's in pretty good shape -- it just needs some creative housekeeping," said John Belle, a partner in Beyer Blinder Belle, the architectural firm responsible for restoring the building, and renovating Grand Central Terminal and Rockefeller Center.
The work at Chrysler will include the repair and relighting of Edward Trumbull's ceiling mural in the lobby, the cleaning of the surrounding walls (made of a richly veined marble called Moroccan rouge flame) and the preparation of a master redesign plan for the storefronts.
The restoration proposal and storefront plan are subject to approval by the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission, as is the connection between the tower and the new structure designed by Mr. Johnson.
But the annex on Third Avenue is not a landmark. Constructed in 1952 as the Chrysler Building East, and known recently as the Kent Building, it is thoroughly undistinguished.
"Not only isn't it terribly attractive," Mr. Speyer said, "but it isn't as efficient as it could be." The floors of the annex are to be expanded slightly to the west, thereby placing the elevator core in the middle of the building rather than against the back wall, where it is now.
The extension, totaling about 130,000 square feet, will be clad in glass from floor to ceiling, Mr. Johnson said, while the rest of the building will have smaller windows with glass panels between them, in a darker color.
Still the enfant terrible of American architecture today at the age of 92, Mr. Johnson set New York abuzz in the late 1970's when he crowned the AT&T headquarters on Madison Avenue at 55th Street with an enormous broken pediment. That building, now known as Sony Plaza, was instantly likened to a skyscraping Chippendale highboy.
For the Chrysler annex, Mr. Johnson made no attempt to echo the automotive motifs in the landmark, like radiator-cap gargoyles and hubcap-lined cornices.
"I don't even like the architecture of it," he confessed, "but it's become sacred now. It's the most loved building in New York."

HEADLINE: It's Tenants Versus Tourists At Manhattan's Illegal B&B's

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Henry Cohen is a man possessed: he attaches a tiny, secret-agent-like video camera outside the window of his rental apartment on West 71st Street and stares at a television showing his building's front steps.
"It's got a motion sensor," he says, "so it just records when somebody's coming in." 
 The people Mr. Cohen wants to catch coming into his brownstone are not thieves or drug dealers. They are tourists, like the Chinese man who kicked Mr. Cohen's door one night last month. Or the Paris film crew that moved in with all its equipment. Or the dozen Dutch tourists who galloped like gazelles up and down the stairs the month before.
In a city with a burnished new image, waves of tourism, and booked-up hotels with the highest rates in the country, it was bound to happen: bed-and-breakfasts are springing up in rental buildings all over Manhattan, where landlords are forgoing the security of long-term leases for the chance to make thousands more a year putting up tourists for the night.
Many of the bed-and-breakfasts -- in truth, they usually offer just a bed -- are in rent-regulated buildings in affluent neighborhoods, where frustrated landlords have long complained that they are entitled to more money. They are now making it.
But like a lot of other convenient, money-making endeavors, this one is illegal in a number of ways. Most operators of transient rooms in residential buildings not only violate zoning laws and building codes that require special fire safety measures, but also do not have proper licenses, and many do not pay sales or hotel taxes.
And if the apartments are in rent-regulated buildings, the owners are further prohibited from charging more than the legal monthly rent, which they easily do when they rent the apartment for anywhere from $80 to $150 a night.
"If they're in a residential neighborhood, and they're running a bed-and-breakfast, they are illegal -- it's that simple," said Ted Birkhahn, a spokesman for the Department of Buildings, which has no estimate of the number of such operations.
But that does not seem to worry Richard Caine, who will talk passionately and at length about how he uses two apartments in a rent-stabilized building he owns on West 70th Street as transient rooms, for which he sometimes charges $125 a night. "With the rent laws," he explains simply, "once you give a lease to a person, you can never get him out."
So Mr. Caine, a part-time actor who has appeared on "Murphy Brown" and "General Hospital," has made a thriving business out of renting his apartments and helping other landlords and cooperative owners rent theirs to guests, many of them actors and theatrical directors in town for short visits.
"I don't know of any law I'm breaking," said Mr. Caine, emphasizing that he is using his two apartments as short-term rentals only while he prepares to combine them into one apartment to be used by family members. He added that because he does not provide meals or maid service, his building cannot be considered a hotel and should not be bound by hotel regulations.
"I am not a sheet-changer or a floor-cleaner," he said. "What I'm doing is filling a niche, somewhere between the Y.M.C.A. and a hotel, and it's to the advantage of the city. I don't see how anyone can complain."
So far, the city has shown little interest in exercising its enforcement power, which mainly consists of shutting the businesses down, or even in regulating them, perhaps because they are a way for many thousands more tourists a year to afford to visit New York.
Officials could cite only two recent cases of shutting down such operations after complaints. State and city tax officials also seem to have turned a blind eye.
But the leaseholding tenants in buildings like Mr. Caine's have begun to complain, loudly and with lawyers, describing how their once-homey apartment buildings have been turned into something like the jammed stateroom scene from the Marx brothers' "Night at the Opera."
Llewelyn Barton, who has lived in Mr. Caine's building for more than 20 years and now shares a floor with one of the transient rooms, keeps a log of the traffic she spies through her peephole. "Appeared to be a group of young guys -- couldn't tell how many," reads her March 18 entry. "They were a little noisy. Saw them several days in a row."
A few weeks later, after dozens more guests came and went, the diary picks up testily: "Couple -- 30-something. Chubby woman with dark curly hair having an argument and slamming the door. He was complaining to her that she was never satisfied by anything he did."
"It started several years ago," said Ms. Barton, a former backup singer who runs the computer help desk at a large entertainment company, "but in the last few months, it's gotten pretty heavy."
Mark Levine, a struggling playwright who lives downstairs, said he was recently followed home at night by two men who suddenly turned into his doorway and stood behind him.
"I got really scared," he said. "I thought they were going to rob me. And then they said, 'Richard Caine bed-and-breakfast? Richard Caine bed-and-breakfast?' "
Such operations have been around for years in various guises. During the recession in the early 1990's, many cooperative owners stuck with overpriced apartments they could not sell but no longer lived in began to advertise their places for overnight stays.
Tenants in rental apartments have also earned extra income illegally while on vacation by letting agencies put up tourists in their homes.
While such accommodations were long publicized mostly by word of mouth, the Internet is now full of advertisements for nightly or weekly apartment rentals and for bed-and-breakfast agencies that offer enticing descriptions of New York. (One describes the East Village as "the land of punk and funk," adding that "Madonna lived here before she became a star.")
Mr. Cohen, who has lived in his sunny rent-controlled apartment for more than 30 years, said he watched with growing anxiety as his landlord, Veronica Muth, who bought the building and another one down the street in 1996, began to convert apartments in both places into hotel-like rooms.
Of the nine apartments in his building, Mr. Cohen believes five are being used for tourists and short-term corporate tenants, who are usually charged about $100 a night, depending on the length of stay and size of the apartment. (That would mean a monthly income per apartment of about $3,000 -- much more than the regulated rent -- if the apartment was booked every night.)
So Mr. Cohen has transformed himself into a kind of detective, keeping not only a video record of tourists coming and going, but also still photos of apartments being renovated and audiotapes of tourists talking about their accommodations. He wants these records in case he ever has to show in court how his building is being used.
Ms. Muth did not return telephone messages seeking comment about the buildings, nor did Alan Kucker, a lawyer who has represented her.
Like other long-term tenants in the same situation, Mr. Cohen says that while he is bothered by noise and tourists mistaking him for a concierge, his main concern is safety.
He recalled being startled when a confused tourist from China, thinking that Mr. Cohen's locked apartment was his own, kicked the door in the middle of night.
When new guests arrive late at night, they pick up keys to Mr. Cohen's building at a pizza restaurant down the block. (A reporter who visited the pizza place last week was shown keys to the front door and apartment No. 4F on a labeled key chain by a cashier, who said, shrugging, "Sometimes the owner comes; sometimes somebody else comes. We just hold the keys.")
"There could be keys to this building floating all over this city, all over the world for that matter," Mr. Cohen said.
Leo MacDougall, an American who now lives in Paris and who came to New York in May with two other Parisians to make a documentary for French television, said that as soon as the group paid in cash for a nine-day stay in Mr. Cohen's building, they immediately made copies of the single set of keys.
"We were careful with them, but I can see what he's talking about," Mr. MacDougall said, referring to Mr. Cohen.
Agencies that help tourists find apartments contend that such safety concerns are unfounded.
Mary McAulay, who runs Urban Ventures, perhaps the city's best-known agency, said that in almost 20 years in business, she has never had a report of a tenant being robbed or assaulted by a tourist or someone who got hold of a key.
"We don't get perps," said Ms. McAulay, who represents about 400 bed-and-breakfasts and so-called unhosted apartments, a number that fluctuates greatly and always shoots up in the summer. "These are people who are as concerned about their own security as the other tenants."
Mr. Cohen is not convinced. He and his wife, Marja, keep a heavy stick by the door, just in case. "You never know who's going to be out there," he said.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA;
The Leaders' Remarks: Hopes for a Lasting Friendship, Even if Imperfect

 BODY:
Following is the transcript of the news conference that President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin held in Beijing yesterday, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company, and transmitted by The Associated Press. Mr. Jiang's remarks were translated by the Chinese.
 
PRESIDENT JIANG
Ladies and gentlemen, just now I've held official talks with President Clinton. The two sides have held an extensive and in-depth exchange of views on China-U.S. relations and major international and regional issues. The talks were positive, constructive and productive. 
 The successful exchange of visits between the two heads of state of China and the United States marks a new stage of growth for China-U.S. relations. This not only serves the common interest of China and the United States, but also will be of important significance to promoting peace, stability and prosperity in Asia-Pacific and the world at large.
Peace and development are the main themes of the contemporary time. In the new historical condition, the common interests between China and the United States are increasing, not decreasing. The foundation for cooperation between the two countries is reinforcing, not weakening.
Both sides believe that China and the United States, as permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, should continue to work together to promote peace and the security in the world, and Asia-Pacific in particular, to ease and eliminate all kinds of tensions and to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to strengthen the efforts in protecting the environment, combating international crime, drug trafficking, and international terrorism.
Our two sides have agreed to further step up cooperation and dialogue between the two countries on major international issues. China-U.S. relations are improving and growing. The cooperation between the two sides in many areas has made important progress.
President Clinton and I have decided that China and the United States will not target the strategic nuclear weapons under their respective control at each other. This demonstrates to the entire world that China and the United States are partners, not adversaries. I hereby wish to reiterate that since the very first day when China came into possession of nuclear weapons, China has undertaken not to be the first to use nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
President Clinton and I have reached a broad range of agreements and consensus on further increasing exchanges and cooperation between China and the United States in all areas in our bilateral relations. We have agreed to take positive steps to promote the growth of the mutually beneficial economic cooperation and trade between China and the United States and to expand the exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the energy, environment, scientific, educational, cultural, health, legal and military fields, and also to enhance the people-to-people exchanges and friendship.
We have also agreed to enhance the consultations and cooperation between China and the United States on the issues of disarmament, arms control and nonproliferation. And we have issued joint statements on . . . protocol on the question of the anti-personnel land mines and on the question of South Asia.
The Taiwan question is the most important and the most sensitive issue at the core of China-U.S. relations. We hope that the U.S. side will adhere to the principles set forth in three China-U.S. joint communiques and the joint China-U.S. statement, as well as the relevant commitments it has made in the interest of the smooth growth of China-U.S. relations.
The improvement and growth of China-U.S. relations have not come by easily. It is the result of the concerted efforts of the governments and people of our two countries. So we should all the more treasure this good result.
China and the United States have different social systems, ideologies, values and cultural traditions. We have differences of views on certain issues. However, they should not become the obstacles in the way of the growth of China-U.S. relations.
The world is a colorful one. The development path of countries in the world should be chosen by the people of the countries concerned. China and the United States should view and handle the bilateral relations from a long-term and strategic perspective. We should promote the growth of China-U.S. relations in a spirit of mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit, seeking common ground while putting aside differences, and developing cooperation.
I believe that through the concerted effort of both sides, we will make constant progress in the direction of building a constructive strategic partnership between China and the United States oriented towards the 21st century.
 
PRESIDENT CLINTON
Thank you, Mr. President. And may I also thank the Chinese people for their warm welcome to me, to my family and to our delegation.
In the past five years, President Jiang and I have met seven times. Mr. President, your leadership is helping us to transform our nations' relationship to the future. Clearly a stable, open, prosperous China, shouldering its responsibilities for a safer world, is good for America.
Nothing makes that point better than today's agreement not to target our nuclear missiles at each other. We also agreed to do more to shore up stability in Asia, on the Korean peninsula and the Indian subcontinent.
I reaffirmed our longstanding one-China policy to President Jiang and urged the pursuit of cross-Strait discussions, recently resumed, as the best path to a peaceful resolution.
In a similar vein, I urged President Jiang to assume a dialogue with the Dalai Lama in return for the recognition that Tibet is a part of China and in recognition of the unique cultural and religious heritage of that region.
I welcome the progress we made today in nonproliferation, including China's decision to actively study joining the missile technology control regime, our joint commitment not to provide assistance to ballistic missile programs in South Asia, and President Jiang's statement last week that China will not sell missiles to Iran.
We also welcome the steps China recently has taken to tighten nuclear export controls, to strengthen controls on the export of chemicals that can be turned into weapons, and to work jointly with us to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention.
As the President said, we are also working together against international crime, drug trafficking, alien smuggling, stepping up our scientific cooperation, which already has produced remarkable breakthroughs in areas including the fight against birth defects like spina bifida. We are helping to eradicate polio and working to predict and to mitigate natural disasters. And perhaps most important over the long run, we are committed to working together on clean energy to preserve our natural environment, a matter of urgent concern to both our nations.
I'm also very pleased by our cooperation on rule-of-law programs, from training lawyers and judges to providing legal assistance to the poor. President Jiang and I agreed on the importance of China's entry into the World Trade Organization. I regret we did not make more progress on this front, and we must recommit ourselves to achieving that goal on strong terms.
We agreed that we need to work together to avoid another round of destabilizing currency devaluations in the region and to restore economic growth.
As you can see, we are working together in many areas of cooperation. We have developed a relationship of openness and candor. When we differ, as we do from time to time, we speak openly and honestly in an effort to understand our differences and, if possible, to work toward a common approach to resolving them.
It is well-known that the principal area of our difference in recent years has been over human rights questions. America recognizes and applauds China's economic and social transformation, which has expanded the rights of its citizens by lifting hundreds of millions from poverty, providing them greater access to information, giving them village elections, greater freedom to travel and to choose their own jobs, and better education for their children.
As I said again to President Jiang, we Americans also firmly believe that individual rights, including the freedom of speech, association and religion, are very important not only to those who exercise them, but also to nations, whose success in the 21st century depends upon widespread individual knowledge, creativity, free exchange and enterprise.
Therefore, we welcome China's decision to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the recent release of several prominent political dissidents, the recent visit China graciously accorded American religious leaders, and the resumption of a human rights dialogue between China and the United States.
Earlier this morning, during my official welcome, I could hear and see the many echoes of China's past and the call of its promising future, for Tiananmen Square is a historic place. There, 100 years ago, China's quest for constitutional government was born. There, in 1919, young people rallied against foreign occupation and launched a powerful movement for China's political and cultural renewal. There, in 1976, public mourning for Zhou Enlai led to the Cultural Revolution's end and the beginning of your remarkable transformation. And there, nine years ago, Chinese citizens of all ages raised their voices for democracy.
For all of our agreements, we still disagree about the meaning of what happened then. I believe and the American people believe that the use of force and the tragic loss of life was wrong. I believe and the American people believe that freedom of speech, association and religion are, as recognized by the U.N. charter, the right of people everywhere and should be protected by their governments.
It was to advance these rights that our founding fathers in our Declaration of Independence pledged "our lives, our fortunes, our sacred honor." Fifty years ago, the U.N. recognized these rights as the basic freedoms of people everywhere.
The question for us now is, how shall we deal with such disagreements and still succeed in the important work of deepening our friendship and our sense of mutual respect?
First, we Americans must acknowledge the painful moments in our own history when fundamental human rights were denied. We must say that we know still we have to continue our work to advance the dignity and freedom and equality of our own people. And second, we must understand and respect the enormous challenges China has faced in trying to move forward against great odds, with a clear memory of the setbacks suffered in past periods of instability.
Finally, it is important that whatever our disagreements over past action, China and the United States must go forward on the right side of history for the future sake of the world. The forces of history have brought us to a new age of human possibility. But our dreams can only be recognized by nations whose citizens are both responsible and free.
Mr. President, that is the future America seeks to build with China, in partnership and honest friendship.
Tomorrow, Hillary and I will visit the Great Wall. The wall's builders knew they were building a permanent monument, even if they were unable to see it finished in their lifetimes. Likewise, we know we are building a friendship that will serve our descendants well, even if we ourselves will not see its full development across the next century and into the new millennium.
Our friendship may never be perfect. No friendship is. But I hope it will last forever.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. In the recent Asian financial crisis, the Chinese Government has pledged to maintain the value of its currency. And that's making a positive contribution to stabilizing the situation in Asia. However, on Friday the Japanese yen's exchange rate to the dollar dropped again. So what specific common measures are the Chinese and the U.S. government prepared to take to stabilize the financial situation in Asia and the world?
MR. CLINTON. Well, first of all, let me agree with you. I think that China has shown great statesmanship and strength in making a strong contribution to the stability not only of the Chinese people and their economy but the entire region by maintaining the value of its currency.
The United States, as you know, has worked hard to try to support the stability of the Japanese yen and to help growth resume in Japan. I think that what we have agreed to do is to continue to do whatever we can to promote stability and to support policies within Japan that will restore confidence in the economy, get investment going again and get growth going.
The key here, I believe, is for the plans to reform the financial institutions in Japan and take other steps that will get growth going and get investments going in Japan to be made. I think that ultimately President Jiang and I would give anything to be able to just wave a wand and have all of this go away. We are not the only actors in this drama, and a lot of this must be done by the Japanese Government and the Japanese people. We can be supportive, but they have to make the right decisions.
 Q. We know that there were four dissidents in Xian who were arrested earlier, and three were released. And one of them is still under detainment. And I'd like to know if you talked about the issue. And what about the rest of the 2,000 dissidents who are being reported as still under imprisonment right now in China?
MR. JIANG. In our talks just now, President Clinton raised this issue. We adopt an attitude of extending a very warm welcome to the visit to China by President Clinton. As for the matter you raised, I think you are referring to the incident in Xian. And I think in China there's no question that there is no restriction whatsoever on the coverage and the interviews by the reporters and correspondents within the scope of law. But as for some activities that have been detrimental or have prejudiced the security, then the local authorities should take measures to deal with them. And it is also understandable.
As for the question you raised, actually, I do not have very detailed information in this regard. But as for the latter part of your question concerning 2,000 dissidents, I think in China we have our laws. And in China's constitution, it is clearly stipulated that the Chinese citizens have the freedom of speech. But any law-breaking activities must be dealt with according to law. I think this is true in any country of rule of law. And I think China's judicial department will deal with the matter according to law.
And I want to add that I believe that the vast majority of the correspondents and the reporters are willing to promote the friendship between China and the United States through President Clinton's visit to China this time.
However, before President Clinton's visit, I read some reports from the media and newspapers saying -- alleging China had been involved in the so-called political contributions in the United States. I really think it's very absurd and ridiculous, and I think they are sheer fabrications. China can never do such a thing, and China never interferes in other countries' internal affairs.
Actually, at the talks this morning, President Clinton asked me this question. And I told him that after hearing of such an allegation, we conducted very earnest investigation into the matter. And the result of the investigation shows that there is never such a thing.
Recently, in my meetings with many foreign visitors and visiting leaders of other countries, I often said to them that as countries in the world have different social systems and values, it is something that should be allowed that they may have different understandings about one fact. And this actually itself is a representation and a manifestation of democracy. However, what is important is that the fact itself should not be distorted.
I'm sorry, I've taken up too much of the time. And I now invite President Clinton to say a few words.
MR. CLINTON. Well, we did discuss the questions you raised. And, of course, I made my views known about the recent detentions yesterday. On the larger question you raised, I actually made a couple of specific and practical suggestions about how we might take our dialogue farther there.
There are some people who are incarcerated now for offenses no longer on the books in China, reflecting real progress in present Chinese practice. And the Chinese -- in my view, we should acknowledge that. But the question then arises, is there some way that these people might be released? Is there some procedure through which we could move?
There are some people imprisoned for nonviolent activities in June of '89. Is there something that could be done there? There are some other practical things we discussed which I think it would be premature to ask the Chinese Government to make a statement on now because we just have had these discussions.
But I want to say to all of you that that atmosphere -- whatever your position on these issues, and particularly if you agree with me, I think you should at least appreciate the fact that we now have an atmosphere in which it is possible for us to be honest, and honest in great detail about this, and that there are legitimate and honest differences in the way we look at this. But I believe that we are making progress, and I believe we will make more. I remember the thing that I specified in my statement about that.
You can see that neither one of us are shy about being strong about how we believe about this. And I think that we have them in the public debate now. We have them in the private discussions. And we just have to keep pushing forward in trying to work through it.
Q. President Jiang spoke of China's position against the first use of nuclear weapons, a policy the United States does not agree with. Was this discussed in the context of negotiations on the detargeting agreement? And were there any U.S. concessions in order to obtain the detargeting agreement?
MR. CLINTON. Well, the short answer to your question, and the accurate one, is no. But I don't want it to be a misleading answer. That is, you well understand that our position on that issue is a product of decades of experience in a former time. We have not changed our position, nor are we prepared to do so on that.
But this was a mutual decision we made because we both felt that, number one, if we detargeted, we would completely eliminate the prospect ever of any kind of accidental launch. And number two, we would take one more step in showing mutual confidence and trust in one another. And number three, it would be a helpful signal as a counter-weight to the recent nuclear tests in India and Pakistan. And so we agreed that it was in both our interests to do this on its own terms.
MR. JIANG. Speaking in English before Mr. Clinton's answer was translated into Chinese. This is my view.
MR. JIANG. In Chinese. I'd like to make a brief explanation. As I stated just now, President Clinton and I decided that China and the United States would not target the strategic nuclear weapons under their respective control at each other. That's a full stop. Then this demonstrates to the entire world that China and the United States are partners, not adversaries. Full stop again.
And then I said, "I hereby reiterate that since the very first day that China came into possession of nuclear weapons, China has undertaken not to be the first to use nuclear weapons under any circumstances." Full stop. That's my view. That's our view.
 Q. What is the position of the Chinese government on the human rights issue?
MR. JIANG. China and the United States have differences of views and also have common ground on the human rights issue. More than 2,000 years ago, a great thinker of China's Han dynasty inaudible once said, "Of all the living things nurtured between heaven and earth, the most valuable is human beings."
So the Chinese nation always respects and maintains the dignity and the rights of the people. Today the Chinese Government solemnly commits itself to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedom.
The United States is the most developed country in the world, with a per capita G.D.P. approaching $30,000, while China is a developing country with a population of 1.2 billion with a per capita G.D.P. of less than $700. As the two countries differ in social system, ideology, historical tradition and cultural background, the two countries have different means and ways in realizing human rights and fundamental freedoms. So it's nothing strange that we may have some difference of views over some issues.
China stresses that the top priority should be given to right to subsistence and the right to development. Meanwhile, efforts should be made to strengthen democracy and the legal system and to protect the economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights of the people.
I listened very carefully to what President Clinton said just now, and I noticed that he made a mention of the political disturbances happening in Tiananmen in 1989 and that he also told the history of the Tiananmen and told of the things that happened in Tiananmen.
With regard to the political disturbances in 1989, the Chinese people have long drawn a historical conclusion. During my visit to the United States last year, and also on many international occasions, I have stated our position that with regard to the political disturbances in 1989, had the Chinese Government not taken the resolute measures, then we could not have enjoyed the stability that we are enjoying today.
China is a socialist country in which its people are masters of the nation. The Chinese people can elect their own representatives to the people's congresses through direct or indirect means. And they can fully express their views and exercise their political rights.
In the two decades since the reform and opening-up program was started, the National People's Congress of China has adopted more than 320 laws and acts, thus constantly strengthening the legal protection of the democracy, fundamental freedom and various rights enjoyed by the Chinese people.
Over the past two decades, another 200 million people in China were lifted out of poverty. No country's human rights situation is perfect. Since the founding of new China, the fundamental changes and the tremendous achievements that have been achieved ... in the human rights conditions in China, are for all to see.
I'd like to know whether President Clinton would have anything more to add.
MR. CLINTON. I would like to add a comment. First of all, I think this debate and discussion today has been a healthy thing and a good thing. Secondly, I think to understand the priority that each country attaches to its own interpretation of this issue of human rights, you have to understand something of our history.
The Chinese who are here understand better than I the price paid over time at various moments in history for disruption and upheaval in China. So there is an understandable desire to have stability in the country. Every country wants stability.
Our country was founded by people who felt they were abused by royal powers, by people in power. And they wanted to protect their personal liberties by putting limits on government. And they understood, they understood clearly, that any system, because human beings are imperfect, any system can be abused.
So the question for all societies, going forward into the 21st century, is, which is the better gamble? If you have a lot of personal freedom, some people may abuse it. But if you are so afraid of personal freedom because of the abuse that you limit people's freedom too much, then you pay, I believe, an even greater price in a world where the whole economy is based on ideas and information and exchange and debate, and children everywhere dreaming dreams and feeling they can live their dreams out.
So I am trying to have a dialogue here that will enable both of us to move forward so that the Chinese people will get the best possible results. I believe stability in the 21st century will require high levels of freedom.
Q. Not interpreted.
MR. JIANG. I'm sorry, I have to take up an additional five minutes. I'd like to say a few words on the Dalai Lama. President Clinton is also interested in this question, in the Dalai Lama. Actually, since the Dalai Lama left in 1959, earthshaking changes have taken place in Tibet.
First, the system of theocracy has forever become bygone, but though it is unfortunate that the disappearance of this theocracy was much later than the demise of theocracy in Europe, before the Renaissance. And the more than 1 million serfs under the rule of the Dalai Lama were liberated.
In 1990, when I was in Tibet, I went to visit the liberated serfs. And now the system of national autonomy is in practice in Tibet. And the people there, they have their Tibet --an autonomous region government. Since I came to work in the central government, I have urged the 29 sovereign municipalities and autonomous regions to assist Tibet in its development, even including those provinces that are not very developed, such as Qinghai province. So, altogether, nearly 8 billion yuan of financial resources were raised, and already 62 projects have been completed in Tibet.
As for the freedom of religious belief, there is clear stipulation in our constitution for the protection of religious belief, and this also includes in Tibet. And we have also spent a lot of money in renovating the lamaseries and the temples in Tibet, and we have spent 100 million yuan and one ton of gold in renovating the Potala Palace.
Just now, President Clinton also mentioned the Tibetan issue and the dialogue with the Dalai Lama. Actually, as long as the Dalai Lama can publicly make a statement and a commitment that Tibet is an inalienable part of China and that he must also recognize Taiwan as a province of China, then the door to dialogue and negotiation is open. Actually, we are having several channels of communications with the Dalai Lama. So I hope the Dalai Lama will make positive response in this regard.
Finally, I want to emphasize that according to Chinese constitution, the freedom of religious belief in Tibet, and also throughout China, is protected. But as the President of the People's Republic of China and as a member of the Communist Party, I myself am an atheist. But this will by no means affect my respect for the religious freedom in Tibet.
But still, I have a question. That is, during my visit to the United States last year, and also during my previous visit to other European countries, I found that although the education and the science and the technology have developed to a very high level and the people are now enjoying modern civilization, still quite a number of them have a belief in Lamaism. So this is a question that I'm still studying and still looking into. I want to find out the reason why.
I think President Clinton is a strong defender of the American interest, and I am a strong defender of the Chinese interest. But despite that, we still can have very friendly exchanges of views and discussion. And I think that is democracy. And I want to stress that actually there are a lot of areas in which we can learn from each other.
 In English. If you agree, we will finish this.
MR. CLINTON. I agree, but you have to let me say one thing about the Dalai Lama. First, I agree that Tibet is a part of China, an autonomous region of China. And I can understand why the acknowledgment of that would be a precondition of dialogue with the Dalai Lama. But I also believe that there are many, many Tibetans who still revere the Dalai Lama and view him as their spiritual leader.
President Jiang pointed out that he has a few followers of Tibetan Buddhism even in the United States and Europe. But most of his followers have not given up their own religious faith. He has followers who are Christians -- supporters -- excuse me, not followers, supporters -- who are Christians, who are Jews, who are Muslims, who believe in the unity of God and who believe he is a holy man.
But for us, the question is not fundamentally religious. It is political. That is, we believe that other people should have the right to fully practice their religious beliefs and that if he, in good faith, presents himself on those terms, it is a legitimate thing for China to engage him in dialogue.
And let me say something that will perhaps be unpopular with everyone. I have spent time with the Dalai Lama. I believe him to be an honest man. And I believe if he had a conversation with President Jiang, they would like each other very much.
MR. JIANG. Thank you for your attention.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: NEWS ANALYSIS -- Surprising Exchange on Rights on Chinese Television;
With a Nod to Cultural and Historic Differences, 2 Leaders Smile and Disagree on Delicate Issues

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 27

 BODY:
President Clinton handed China's leaders a gift simply by coming here, giving them global respect despite the sharp criticism of his China policy back home.
Today, with the surprise decision to televise an extended news conference and debate on human rights, China may have returned the favor. The live telecast allowed Mr. Clinton to make forceful statements on human rights and Tibet before a Chinese audience, thereby addressing American criticism that he was appeasing a repressive Government even as he pressed forward with his strategy of engaging the Chinese. Transcript, page 9.
Though the basic differences between the United States and China are no secret here, it was highly unusual for the Chinese to see anyone on television calling the 1989 killings on Tiananmen Square wrong, or praising the integrity of the Dalai Lama. Chinese news reports on touchy debates are invariably one-sided and brief -- as was the television coverage tonight on the day's encounter.
American officials were elated with the televised debate, and convinced it would help justify the President's complex policy of engaging a country with fundamentally different views on freedoms. The American national security adviser, Samuel Berger, gloated that the event was a first, allowing open debate on topics censored in China's official press. It was by no means clear how many Chinese saw the press conference, since the fact that it would be broadcast live was not advertised in advance. Word of the debate, however, was spreading around Beijing.
Still, the live broadcast, which must have been approved at the highest levels, was a testament to the Chinese Government's trust in President Clinton, who is viewed here as a great statesman, pursuing America's long-term interests with China despite backbiting from his political enemies. They had to know he might forcefully raise sensitive issues, but also gambled that he would raise them, as he did, with a nod to China's historical and cultural differences, and that the two Presidents would end the hour with smiles.
Both leaders, indeed, could turn their exchange today to political advantage. It provided an example of their largely shared vision of a partnership in which common interests are pursued while differences are acknowledged and debated, as they did in Washington last October when President Jiang visited. In this convenient formulation, the airing of differences becomes a sign of strength in the relationship.
Yet the statements today also foretell discord and disappointment. For inherent in President Clinton's vision, and his ability to sell it domestically, is the idea that by engaging China, promoting investment and trade as well as educational and technical ties, he will cause China to be more like the United States.
Over a long enough time frame he might be right, but in the coming years, at least, there is no guarantee that China's profound economic and social changes will lead to Western-style political freedoms.
The broadcast signaled the security of President Jiang Zemin and his policies of economic reform and deeper ties with the United States.
"I think this shows the Chinese leadership is very confident," said Liu Xuecheng, an expert on Chinese-American relations at the China Center for International Studies.
Far from shying away from debate, President Jiang had clearly prepared for the pointed exchanges. Though an American reporter first asked about the detention of dissidents, it was no accident that a Chinese news reporter asked him to explain China's human rights policy. Nor was it coincidental that he had prepared detailed notes on the subject and that he volunteered to expound on China's Tibet policy.
"I think President Clinton is a strong defender of the American interest, and I am a strong defender of the Chinese interest," Mr. Jiang said. "But despite that, we still can have very friendly exchanges of views and discussion. And I think that is democracy."
Along similar lines, Shen Dingli, deputy director of American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, saw the debate as positive. "Both countries could uphold their positions on human rights, but still be friendly," he said.
President Clinton, too, said at the press conference today, that "it is important that whatever our disagreements over past actions, China and the United States must go forward on the right side of history for the future sake of the world."
The initial days of his visit have in fact highlighted these differences. The day he arrived, a hard-line culture chief in modern, prosperous Shanghai blocked the travel to New York of a historical opera, commissioned and paid for by Lincoln Center, because it did not meet her ideas of cultural correctness.
Mr. Clinton's visit to Xian was preceded by the temporary detention of a few local democracy campaigners -- a routine roundup for China, but one that shocked the visitors.
Indeed, in the "debate" today, Mr. Jiang gave not an inch. Dissidents were jailed, he said, because they had violated the law -- and isn't this what China's vaunted progress toward the "rule of law" is all about? he seemed to ask.
The use of combat troops to end the 1989 student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, killing hundreds in the process, could not have been a mistake. "Had the Chinese Government not taken the resolute measures we did then we could not have enjoyed the stability that we are enjoying today," Mr. Jiang said, repeating an oft-used argument.
On Tibet, Mr. Jiang sounded more conciliatory than another official did on Friday when he all but called the Dalai Lama a murderer and torturer. As President Jiang put it, if only the Dalai Lama will acknowledge that Tibet is part of China and that Taiwan is a province of China, then "the door to negotiation is open."
This formulation has actually been policy for some time. However, despite the Dalai Lama's recent statements that he is ready to talk about degrees of autonomy for Tibet, Chinese leaders insist that his actions still betray a dedication to independence. Whether the huge suspicions can be overcome remains to be seen.
This afternoon Mr. Berger was asked whether China had made any concessions on rights. He said, referring to the televised debate, "The very fact that this happened is movement on the part of the Chinese."
Mr. Shen, the Shanghai scholar, made a similar point: "We need to view the achievements of this summit through the interactions, not what gets written on paper."

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton and Jiang Debate Views Live on TV, Clashing on Rights

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 27

 BODY:
The United States-China summit meeting ended tonight with a formal state dinner after an extraordinary live televised exchange between President Clinton and Jiang Zemin, the Chinese President, over human rights, Tibet and China's path to the future.
The two leaders announced a number of agreements, including a pledge to retarget their ballistic missiles quickly so that neither side is aiming nuclear weapons at the other. 
 The two nations also announced modest progress toward China's adherence to an international missile proliferation agreement and steps toward China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
But the drama of the meeting came in a remarkable 70-minute news conference, carried live on nationwide Chinese television, in which the two Presidents differed sharply on the nature of personal freedom, the role of the state and the meaning of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations that were violently suppressed by the Chinese Government in June 1989.
Some American officials expressed concern after today's exchange that the Chinese might not permit the broadcast of Mr. Clinton's speech on Monday to students at Beijing University, the rhetorical centerpiece of the President's nine-day visit to China. But they said the President had made his point in unvarnished terms before a potentially huge audience.
Because few Chinese knew that the news conference would be televised live, it was unclear how many had actually seen it, although by the evening news of the debate appeared to have spread widely. .
The meeting was the first time a foreign leader had squarely confronted the painful legacy of Tiananmen Square on Chinese soil -- and on Chinese airwaves.
American officials were jubilant because the news conference allowed Mr. Clinton to speak without filters to the Chinese people of American concerns about China's human rights record. It was also, in their view, a powerful response to critics in the United States who said that Mr. Clinton should not have rewarded the Chinese Government with a high-profile summit meeting even as its Communist leaders continued to suppress political speech and the free exercise of religion.
American officials said they did not signal to the Chinese in advance of the news conference that Mr. Clinton planned to speak out forcefully on the Tiananmen Square tragedy. They said they did not want to force Mr. Jiang into a defensive posture, or, more importantly, cause the Chinese to pull the plug on the live broadcast of the event.
The spirited exchange recalled earlier confrontations between top American officials and Communist leaders, including the "kitchen debate" between Richard M. Nixon, then Vice President, and Nikita S. Khrushchev and an early meeting between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev. It also echoed a similar debate on human rights when President Jiang was in Washington last October. But at today's news conference, the back and forth was more forceful and animated.
Mr. Clinton flatly told the Chinese leader that his Government had been "wrong" to use force to end the peaceful demonstrations of the spring of 1989 and that broad personal freedom and political expression were the price of admission to the world community of the 21st century.
"For all of our agreements, we still disagree about the meaning of what happened then," Mr. Clinton said in his opening statement, referring to the violent crackdown on Tiananmen Square the night of June 3-4, 1989, that left hundreds of protesters dead.
"I believe, and the American people believe, that the use of force and the tragic loss of life was wrong," the President said as a stone-faced Mr. Jiang looked on. "I believe, and the American people believe, that freedom of speech, association and religion are, as recognized by the U.N. Charter, the right of people everywhere and should be protected by their governments."
When asked by a reporter about Mr. Clinton's remarks on Tiananmen Square, Mr. Jiang appeared ready with an answer. He defended the use of the army to end what he called the "disturbances" of 1989 as essential to maintaining order.
He said the United States and China had different social systems, ideologies, histories and cultures. "So it's nothing strange that we may have some difference of views over some issues," Mr. Jiang said.
Becoming more emphatic in his expression and gestures, he added, "I have stated our position that with regard to the political disturbances in 1989, had the Chinese Government not taken the resolute measures, then we could not have enjoyed the stability that we are enjoying today." He then offered Mr. Clinton an opportunity to reply.
Mr. Clinton said that the American system was based on a delicate balance between personal liberty and central authority, with liberty the paramount value.
"So the question for all societies going forward into the 21st century is, which is the better gamble?" Mr. Clinton said. "If you have a lot of personal freedom, some people may abuse it. But if you are so afraid of personal freedom because of the abuse that you limit people's freedom too much, then you pay, I believe, an even greater price."
On Tibet, Mr. Clinton urged Mr. Jiang to initiate a direct dialogue with the Dalai Lama, the mountain region's religious leader, in return for recognition that Tibet is part of China. He also urged Mr. Jiang to respect the "unique cultural and religious heritage" of Tibet.
Mr. Jiang insisted that religious freedom was protected in Tibet and said Beijing had invested millions of dollars in the economic development of Tibet and restoration of historic shrines.
But he expressed bewilderment that many educated Americans and Europeans would believe in Lamaism and blindly support the Dalai Lama's calls for greater autonomy.
Mr. Clinton, permitted the last word, said: "Let me say something that will perhaps be unpopular with everyone. I have spent time with the Dalai Lama. I believe him to be an honest man, and I believe if he had a conversation with President Jiang, they would like each other very much." The audience, both Chinese and American, laughed.
At the state dinner in the Great Hall of the People, the leaders wore business suits and Hillary Rodham Clinton a bright yellow pants suit.
In toasting Mr. Clinton, Mr. Jiang noted that the relationship between China and the United States had seen "some twists and turns" but was nevertheless moving forward. He acknowledged differences on some fundamental issues, but added, "What is important is that the common interests between the two sides far outweigh their differences."
In his toast, Mr. Clinton said, "We Americans appreciate the mutual respect of our relationship -- a relationship based on cooperation, candor and recognition of each other's values and traditions."
The agreements announced today offered no breakthroughs in United States-China relations. Rather, they were incremental steps across a broad range of issues.
The two nations will work more closely on fighting disease and environmental health problems, on combating drugs and on clean energy programs. They will cooperate on legal reforms, including the use of the legal system to insure the observance of human rights.
They agreed to work together to reduce and eventually eliminate the global use of antipersonnel land mines. And they pledged to jointly press India and Pakistan to walk back from the nuclear brink by halting all nuclear tests.
"I think this has been quite an extraordinary day in the evolution of U.S.-China relations," said Samuel R. Berger, the White House national security adviser. "This is a summit that produced substantial results that will make life more secure and improve lives in other ways for the American people and for the Chinese people.
"We also saw today a truly historic press conference that for the first time witnessed the leader of the United States and the leader of China discussing and debating a range of issues, but most particularly human rights, to a live audience across China and the United States."
On Sunday morning, President and Mrs. Clinton attended services at Chongwenmen Church, the largest officially-sanctioned church in Beijing, with nearly 3,000 members.
The congregation presented Mr. Clinton with a bilingual Bible and invited him to speak to the overflow crowd.
"We celebrate with you the growth of the practice of our faith in China," Mr. Clinton said in remarks that lasted less than five minutes. "I believe our faith calls upon us to seek unity with people across the world with different backgrounds and races and creeds."
The President added, "I believe Chinese and Americans are brothers and sisters as children of God. We come here in that spirit today."
The President's schedule for Sunday included a tour of the Forbidden City palace in Beijing and a trip to the Great Wall. In the evening, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang were to hold a private dinner at the Zhongnanhai government compound.

Poised for a Sweep: Yankees Trounce Mets Once Again

BYLINE: By BUSTER OLNEY 

 BODY:
A choice ticket to the series between the Yankees and Mets could bring $600, scalpers said. Six hundred dollars, to see the competitive and emotional series, to see crosstown rivals fighting for bragging rights in the world's biggest city.
But with another Yankees rout in progress by the bottom of the seventh inning yesterday, much of the crowd of 53,587 abandoned Shea Stadium, and whole sections of $600 seats were all but empty, as were the bleachers, and even the owners' box next to the Mets dugout. The series is in a full recession. 
 The Yankees won for the second consecutive day, 7-2, seizing on defensive lapses by the Mets, and like so many Super Bowls, this series is a bust, falling far short of expectations. Masato Yoshii, the Mets' struggling right-hander, will try to prevent a Yankees sweep tonight, pitching against Orlando Hernandez.
But the series, as an event, has lost its essential lure; the Yankees have clinched the series, even if they lose tonight. Two teams supposedly playing for intracity dominance are left now to pursue their own distinct destinies.
The Yankees are 55-19, and if the idea of 120 regular-season victories seemed absurd two months ago, then consider this: They have almost completed the toughest part of their schedule, 48 of their last 88 games will be at home, the sluggers Bernie Williams and Chili Davis are expected to rejoin the lineup in the weeks ahead -- and the Yankees are still on a pace to win 120 games.
"They've played like a great team, no doubt about that," said Mets Manager Bobby Valentine, who only hours before learned that Al Leiter, arguably the team's best pitcher, would miss at least four to six weeks and perhaps the rest of the season after tearing a tendon in his left knee. Leiter suffered the injury moving to cover first base in the pivotal inning of Friday's 8-4 loss.
The Mets (42-34) are in the thick of the National League's wild-card race, but they must proceed without Leiter, and with major issues haunting the club. Valentine must soon decide how he will incorporate Todd Hundley, a popular player close to returning from elbow surgery, back into the Mets' lineup, at the risk of offending other regulars, such as Bernard Gilkey and Butch Huskey. The club must decide if it is willing to invest as much as $100 million in re-signing catcher Mike Piazza, who is playing Hundley's natural position. And once again, the Mets are starved for competent relief, and runs have been difficult to come by.
"This is the type of team," Piazza said, "that can't go toe-to-toe with the Yankees, as far as slugging the ball around and hitting home runs. We can play with them, but we've got to play our game, and we can't defeat ourselves."
Which is exactly what they did yesterday. The Mets created excitement in last year's series by shutting out the Yankees in the first game and playing well, even as they lost the last two games. They played miserably yesterday.
Bobby Jones pitched well and the Mets caught everything early. Jones needed just 41 pitches in the first three innings, Piazza threw out Darryl Strawberry on an attempted steal, and John Olerud fielded a grounder and started a double play. All very crisp, very well done.
With one out in the fourth and the left-handed-hitting Paul O'Neill at the plate, the Mets' infield shifted notably, shortstop Rey Ordonez moving toward second, so that he was playing almost directly up the middle. When O'Neill bounced a roller a few feet to the first-base side of second, Ordonez was perfectly positioned, scooping the ball and throwing to first, head high.
Olerud reached up to take the throw, his hands as good as anyone's in the league -- and the ball hit the webbing of his glove and bounced away. He simply dropped the throw, and Olerud explained later that he lost sight of the ball momentarily. "We'll play the rest of the season," Valentine said, "and not see John drop the ball."
Ordonez looked at Olerud. And looked. And looked.
O'Neill led off first, Olerud holding him there, and Strawberry slapped a curveball through the first-base hole. If you believe that Jones would have pitched Strawberry the same way whether there were runners on base or not, then there is this -- if Olerud had not dropped the throw, if O'Neill had not been at first, then Olerud would have been in position to field Strawberry's grounder and the inning would have been over. "Embarrassing," Olerud called his mistake.
Instead, the Yankees had two runners on base and Tino Martinez at the plate. Jones threw a curveball to the Yankees' first baseman, and Martinez lifted a line drive that barely cleared the eight-foot fence in right field and landed in the Mets' bullpen. Whether Yankees fans made up 20 percent of the crowd or 50 percent, they made 100 percent of the noise at that moment, standing and roaring; as Martinez stepped on home plate and deliberately gave Strawberry a double high-five, a cloud of confetti dispersed from the upper deck.
The Mets disintegrated in the seventh. Martinez hit a high, looping line drive down the right-field line, and Butch Huskey ran a flag pattern for the ball -- directly toward the line, then toward the corner, and it carried over his head for a double. After Jorge Posada bunted for a hit, surprising the Mets, Chad Curtis hit a fly ball, and Martinez tagged up and scored, with Posada taking second.
Scott Brosius then pulled a grounder to Ordonez, Posada breaking for third base. Ordonez often throws to third for outs successfully, and he tried again, to get Posada -- and hit the Yankees' catcher in the middle of the back, an error. It was the wrong play to make: a throw to first would have been the second out, and Yankee pitcher Andy Pettitte (9-5) was due to hit next.
"Two easy plays," Valentine said, referring to Olerud's drop and Ordonez's throw. "We don't usually do that."
Strawberry said, "We've done a great job of capitalizing on those kind of mistakes."
Derek Jeter drove in two runs with a bloop hit and O'Neill singled home a run, and with the Yankees winning, 7-2, fans raced for the exits, the series recession in full bloom.
 
INSIDE PITCH
 
TODD HUNDLEY, who has been far away from this weekend's Mets meltdown against the Yankees, got a single in four at-bats last night in the fourth game of his minor league rehabilitation assignment with Class A St. Lucie in Florida. Hundley played left field for St. Lucie for the second game in a row, and again survived intact. He is 3 for 13 in his four games, with one home run. . . . GEORGE STEINBRENNER was not in the Yankees' box, next to the dugout, and club officials say they have no indication he will attend today's game, either. . . . JERRY SEINFELD threw out the first pitch before yesterday's game. On Friday night, Seinfeld attended the game with the former Met KEITH HERNANDEZ. . . . AL LEITER may be out of action for a while, but he did tip his cap toward the Yankees and the way they battled him Friday night. "What impressed me most is that they were taking pitches that most guys don't take," he said. "I understood that they took a lot of pitches coming in, because I watched a lot of tape. But even when they were in a hole, it felt like most of the guys were really sticking to their game plan."

HEADLINE: SIGNOFF;
An Artistic Anchor for Teen-Agers Adrift

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
Vienna Steiner-Stammen says she approached her documentary on improving children's lives through involvement in the arts with a healthy dose of skepticism. Could pursuits like glass blowing, ballet or video making help rescue young people from despair?
So far, that appears to be the case, as presented by "Fire, Risk and Rhythm: Stories of Arts for Change," a documentary to be shown tonight at 7 P.M. and on Wednesday at 10 P.M. on Bravo as part of its national campaign called Start Smart. "What we wanted to say in the program," said Ms. Steiner-Stammen, the executive producer and creative force behind the documentary, "is you can really learn to express yourself and focus on things and get different projects done and kind of realize yourself with an appreciation of the arts." 
 More and more school districts, including New York City's, are seeking to restore arts education in light of the upturn in the economy and studies in the last decade suggesting that music and art programs can bolster academic achievement over all. Although experts say much more research is needed to identify what works and what does not, advocates have plenty of anecdotes to support the benefits of arts education. And "Fire, Risk and Rhythm," told without narration in quick scene cuts and interviews with students and their mentors, adds to them.
The program, shot earlier this year, focuses on three teen-agers, selected for diversity but not necessarily aptitude, who offer street-flavored testimonials on the power of the arts.
There is James Kinnard, an 18-year-old participant in Hilltop Artists-in-Residence, a four-year-old program in Tacoma, Wash., in which low-income children deemed likely to drop out of school or get involved in crime learn and practice glass blowing. In several scenes, teen-agers like Mr. Kinnard, once considered among the toughest vandals on the block, are shown in protective jackets and gloves, delicately swirling molten glass into decorative bowls and vases.
Leaning against a fence outside the school that houses the program, Mr. Kinnard bluntly assesses where he had been headed. "Instead of me being out here trying to sell dope, I can be in there making glass," he says, though at first he thought, "These kids are crazy for playing with hot glass, you know what I'm saying?"
Leslie de la O, 16, the daughter of Mexican immigrants living in Florida, has been transformed by Dance: The Next Generation, a dropout-prevention program affiliated with the School of the Sarasota Ballet. The discipline of mastering pirouettes and leg-bending twists has changed her from a shy girl who hardly ever spoke to a confident teen-ager shown shaking hands with ballet patrons. The program, she says, has taught her to "express herself in other ways, and speaking in public comes with it."
Dahlia Weinstein, a 19-year-old at the alternative Repertory School in New York City, gets a creative spark through the Art Start: Media Works Project, a school program run by volunteer artists that exposes students to film, video and other media. There, she and other teen-agers are shown developing a public-service announcement against racism that is being offered to various television stations. "I wrote this and I see it on TV," says Ms. Weinstein, who appears baffled by the prospect that her work will bebroadcast. This fall, she is entering Hunter College in New York City to study film.
Not everyone, though, sees practical benefits to the arts.
"In the future I don't know what glass blowing has to offer," says Mr. Kinnard's mother, Joyce Armstead. "If you ask me, it's swinging a bar and a tool. Where can that go?"
Alberta Canada, a community activist in Tacoma, comments later, "They may not end up in the art world, but they certainly will have a heightened appreciation."
Quincy Jones, the record producer who began his career as a trumpeter and is host of the Bravo program, helps sum up the message on a personal note: "I was one of these kids until I found music."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Peekskill, N.Y.;
Bringing a Hudson City Back to Its Prime

BYLINE: By CHERYL PLATZMAN WEINSTOCK 

 BODY:
TO stand today under the more than 2,000 red and yellow bulbs of the renovated marquee of the Paramount Center for the Arts, which opened as the Peekskill Paramount in 1930 with Maurice Chevalier and Claudette Colbert in "The Big Pond," is to sense how this riverfront community once shone.
"We've tried to bring the theater back to its prime at the same time that the whole city is doing the same," said Gladys Muller, president of the center's board of trustees. 
 The renovation of the marquee at a cost of about $60,000, completed two years ago, was the final touch in the restoration of the theater. The center has offered live entertainment and revolving art exhibitions since 1982.
Peekskill was a thriving riverfront manufacturing community in the 19th century. It had three docks on the Hudson, a chemical company that produced the first Crayola crayon, several lumberyards, including the N. Dain's Sons Company, which still exists, and seven foundries that shipped nearly 200,000 stoves in 1894, according to John Curran, the city historian.
The city continued to prosper during the first half of the 20th century, but went into economic decline in the 60's and 70's.
"There's no question that Peekskill has come back," said Mayor Frances S. Gibbs. "It's a little different than what it used to be, but we're moving very strongly in a very positive direction. We're intent on preserving Peekskill's historic past while at the same time moving into the next century."
About 50 new businesses, many of them digital technology companies, have opened in the downtown area in the last four years, she said. Meanwhile, the waterfront, the downtown area and several historic sites have been restored.
Allison Tapley Thompson, a chemist at the pigment division here of the Engelhard Corporation, a leading provider of specialty chemical products, , said she felt part of the city's revitalization. Her grandparents were among the first 100 black families to move to Peekskill. Though she was born and raised in Peekskill, she went away to college, lived abroad and then in North Carolina.
"But this is always home, I knew I'd come back," Ms. Thompson said. "I believe Peekskill is a good, hard-working gem of a community. I like the diversity. This part of the Hudson Valley is also so picturesque that it improves your outlook no matter what you do. It's not a concrete jungle."
"The housing market in Peekskill is very strong right now," said Suzanne Macci, a saleswoman at Prudential Richard Albert Realtors in Croton-on-Hudson. "It's one of the few areas in Westchester where you can get a house with character with a provocative community that's still affordable. Here, Victorians can go for in the $200,000 range. If you go to another area in Westchester, they're $400,000 plus. That's a big difference."
About half of Peekskill's housing stock is from the Victorian era, said Eileen Yajure, co-chairwoman of the Friends of Historic Peekskill, a citizens' history group. Patricia Wilson, a sales associate at Coldwell Banker in Croton-on-Hudson, said that "the fineness of the Victorian houses has gotten out and yuppies are coming here from the Bronx and Brooklyn to restore them."
IN addition to the Victorians, the city has many well-priced starter homes, Ms. Wilson said. Two- to three-bedroom, 1,300-square-foot Cape Cods or colonials built in the early 20th century are on the market at from $100,000 to $150,000. Newer larger homes, including ranches and raised ranches, range from $150,000 to $200,00, she said.
There are also rambling Tudors and contemporary ranches in what Ms. Wilson called the Mortgage Hill section of the city, where many bankers used to live. These homes sell for $250,000 to $350,000, she said.
In addition to single-family housing, there are 867 multifamily dwelling units in Peekskill. There are also 1,493 units in 13 condominium complexes. They range from a two-bedroom unit in Hillcrest Park for $75,000 to a newer two-bedroom unit in either Chapel Hill or the Woods III, each of which includes a pool and clubhouse, for $150,000, said Marilyn Pfaller, a broker/owner at ERA Hudson View Realty in Cortlandt Manor. The Society Hill II complex is built on the former estate of the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, the brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of "Uncle Tom's Cabin."
There are also four co-op complexes with a total of 691 units. Ms. Pfaller said co-op prices ranged from $30,000 for a two-bedroom, 900-square-foot unit in The Commons to $159,900 for a three-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot penthouse overlooking the Hudson River in Tower Ridge. Tower Ridge has a pool and tennis courts.
There are also 13 rental complexes with a total of 1,552 units. Five of the complexes are public housing and one is for the elderly. Ms. Pfaller said that a two-bedroom apartment could run from $750 a month in the Parkway Plaza to $950 a month at the Chateau Rive, which has a river view.
Some of the most sought-after apartments in Peekskill are the 20 new two-floor, 1,200-square-foot live/work artists' lofts in the downtown area, which begin at $900 a month, said Ralph DiBart, development consultant to Peekskill. He said 40 more were planned in the next year, with some available as condominiums.
It was the school system that attracted Evelyn and Tony Garcia from Union City, N.J., to Peekskill four and a half years ago. Mr. Garcia owns a products distributing business, and Mrs. Garcia is a teacher's aide.
"I heard about Peekskill through friends and liked the idea that there was a lot of room for parent involvement in the schools," Ms. Garcia said. "I also liked the idea of having a very good mix of children in the system. They're not just taught about different cultures. They learn about them by sharing them and living them." She said her 5-year-old son now knows about Hanukkah and Kwanza, as well as Christmas.
The Peekskill City School District had 2,850 students last year, 48 percent of whom were black, 34 percent white, 16 percent Hispanic and 2 percent Asian.
"I think we're a good example of how urban education works," said Salvatore Corda, superintendent of the district. "We're dealing with many of the issues that affect large urban centers. We continually try to provide whatever support is necessary for our students to succeed, whether it's academic support provided above and beyond the school day or something else."
Peekskill High School offers advanced placement courses in 10 subjects and has a planetarium that is available to the community. Of the school's 146 graduates last year, 63 percent went on to higher education.
AMONG the schools in the district are the Oakside Early Childhood Center for pre-kindergarten and kindergarten. Students attend one of three elementary schools for grades 1 through 5, move on to Peekskill Middle School and then to Peekskill High School, from which Gov. George E. Pataki graduated in 1963.
There is also an alternative secondary school in the district that serves 120 middle and high school students. In addition, there is the pre-kindergarten to grade 8 Roman Catholic Assumption School, where annual tuition is $1,535 for parishioners and $2,235 for others.
To serve the diverse population of Peekskill, the city has more than 20 houses of worship, including African Methodist Episcopal, Roman Catholic, Methodist, Presbyterian, Seventh-day Adventist, Lutheran, Baptist and Pentecostal churches.
The restaurants in the city also mirror its diversity. Among them are Italian restaurants, like Hugo's, Capri I and II; Caribbean Spice, Rafiki's Natural Foods and Cafe; pubs like P.J. Kelly's; Zephs' and Crystal Bay Restaurant on the Hudson for fine dining, and Susan's Restaurant, a bistro.
Named for a Dutch settler, Jan Peek, in 1685, Peekskill was a command headquarters during the Revolutionary War. In 1777, the village was attacked twice by British troops and sacked and burned the second time. Peekskill became an incorporated city in 1940 when it separated from the Town of Cortlandt. The Peekskill Museum, an 1875 Queen Anne house, has 19th-century furniture, clothing and domestic artifacts. The city's trading history with the West Indies and China can be learned at Charles Point in the library/gallery of the National Maritime Historical Society, a nonprofit organization that helps preserve historic ships all over the world.
During the summer, concerts are held in the 15-acre Riverfront Green park, which offers a playground, waterfront trail, a public boat launch, kayaking and boat excursions. The 205-acre Depew Park offers an outdoor swimming pool, five tennis courts, two playgrounds and walking and running trails. It adjoins the Blue Mountain Reservation, a county park in Cortlandt.
Ms. Thompson, who frequents the parks with her 6-year-old daughter, Imani, said: "I dream that Imani will have the opportunities I've had in this town, which have been pretty broad, being exposed to so many different people. I also hope she'll continue to enjoy a comfortable, safe sort of environment where people care and look out for each other as much as expected in the 90's. But maybe a little more."

THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD: In 1850, the Fugitive Slave Act was passed requiring that slaves escaping from the South be captured and returned to their owners. Many people in the North defied the law and set up stations along what was known as the underground railroad to help the slaves. Peekskill is cooperating with New York State and the National Park Service in identifying, documenting and marking stations. "We know the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church was a transfer point for fugitives," said John Curran, Peekskill historian. "Oral and written history confirms it and Harriet Tubman, the black abolitionist, was involved in that church organization in New York City." Another station was the Peekskill estate of Henry Ward Beecher, the brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, said Mr. Curran.

HEADLINE: Nathan Glazer Changes His Mind, Again

BYLINE: By James Traub; James Traub is a contributing writer for the magazine. He has written about Kofi Annan, Webster Hubbell, Floyd Flake and others.

 BODY:
Nathan Glazer has had more second thoughts in his lifetime than most people have had thoughts. He is the most modest (and the least tendentious) of the brilliant Jewish boys who attended City College 60 years ago and later came to be known collectively as the New York Intellectuals. The City College crowd helped chart postwar America's ideological frontier; like many of his classmates, Glazer journeyed steadily rightward for decades, from Trotskyist to social democrat to neo-conservative. But lately, Glazer has begun to adopt -- though scarcely embrace -- some strikingly liberal positions. This spring, Glazer wrote in The New Republic that without affirmative action, hardly any blacks would gain admission to top colleges; and that, he argued, would "undermine the legitimacy of American democracy." Glazer seemed resigned rather than enthusiastic, but it was nonetheless a startling reversal from a scholar who two decades earlier wrote "Affirmative Discrimination," a stinging critique of racial (and other) preferences.
Such is Glazer's prestige, and his reputation for intellectual honesty, that in some liberal precincts his anguished turnaround has been celebrated as a portent of a conservative crack-up, at least on issues of race. Well, perhaps. But it's also possible to read in the 50-year arc of Glazer's career a terrible dashing of the hopes that liberalism itself once rested upon. In books like "Beyond the Melting Pot," which he wrote with Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and in countless essays, Glazer, who for nearly 30 years has been a sociology professor at Harvard, advanced a vision of a pluralistic culture that offered a niche to each new group that came to our shores, while encouraging -- at times compelling -- assimilation into the larger society. 
 No living intellectual is more associated with this optimistic and peculiarly American self-conception than Glazer is. In recent years, however, pluralism has come under attack both by the practitioners of identity politics on the left and by nativists on the right. Now Glazer himself seems to have suffered a loss of faith.
When I went to see him not long ago in his home a few blocks from Harvard Yard, I asked if he had concluded that the dynamic of assimilation and progress that appeared to apply to every American simply does not apply to blacks. Glazer is usually quick with an answer. Now he stopped and started, fumbled and fumfered. At last he said: "As a matter of fact, that is the position. The American mind has placed them in a different category." It was obviously a very painful thing for Glazer to admit -- not so much to me as to himself.
A buoyant documentary about Glazer's crowd at City College, "Arguing the World," has lately been making the rounds of art houses and college campuses. As it happened, the film was screened in Cambridge the night before I was to visit Glazer. It was a big Harvard event -- Derek Bok, a former president of the university, showed up, as did the historians David Landes and Stephan and Abigail Thernstrom.
The film traces the divergent intellectual paths of Glazer, the social theorist Daniel Bell, the conservative luminary Irving Kristol and the literary critic Irving Howe. In the movie, Glazer describes himself as "a junior member" of the City College club. He was born, in fact, several years after Bell and the two Irvings. But listening to his muted, wistful on-screen comments about ancient antagonisms, you can tell that he was also less self-dramatizing -- and less self-aggrandizing -- than his classmates.
Almost alone among the group, Glazer has never written an extended autobiographical passage. (He claims that he has a bad memory.) Bell describes Howe and Norman Podhoretz, another mainstay of the New York Intellectuals, with the Yiddish word farbrent, or "burning"; Glazer, he says, was "always less zealous." After the screening, Bell and Glazer answered questions from the crowd. Bell, still glib and voluble at 79, answered virtually every question first; Glazer sat back, often simply confirming Bell's view.
With his great spray of white hair and his boxy, Kennedy-era tortoise-shell glasses, Glazer looks, at 75, like an over-age quiz kid. He doesn't have much of a public manner; he tends to speak in a monotonous mumble. His manner is gentle, self-deprecating, even a bit plodding.
Glazer's origins are virtually canonical. His parents were Polish immigrants who spoke Yiddish at home; his father operated a sewing machine, and the family lived in tenements in East Harlem and the East Bronx. "We were on our own in terms of making arrangements with the American world," Glazer recalls. The public schools and City College were his ticket to the mainstream, though at City he took the obligatory tour through radical politics. When I asked what line he followed in the factional struggles that raged across the City College cafeteria, Glazer responded, with a good deal of irony, "Luxembourgian, spontaneous, non-Leninist but revolutionary in some obscure way." Glazer never quite had the spirit of the barricades. "Even at City," Irving Kristol says, "he was never much of a radical.
World War II made it plain to the City College crowd that Fascism was a much greater threat to human happiness than capitalism. They had always been fierce anti-Stalinists, but the war placed America in a much more favorable light, and thus largely put an end to their radicalism. Glazer aligned himself with the new anti-Communist left. Writing in the journal Commentary, he criticized Senator Joseph McCarthy in remarkably mild terms. A strain of patriotic optimism ran through much of Glazer's work in the 50's. In 1954, he wrote that, despite a streak of "nostalgia" for Old World identities, "the complete identification of the overwhelming majority" of immigrants in American values "is assured."
In 1960, Glazer began writing a series of articles about New York's ethnic groups. These essays were eventually collected and published as "Beyond the Melting Pot." Moynihan contributed the chapter on the Irish, and most of the conclusion, and between Moynihan's moxie and Glazer's amiability, the two were listed as co-authors. (The book itself is now widely known, to Glazer's amusement, as "Moynihan and Glazer.") "Beyond the Melting Pot" was one of the most popular, and most influential, works of sociology of its time. Glazer and Moynihan showed that immigrants were not getting ahead by shedding their ethnic identities -- that they continued to behave in identifiably "ethnic" ways. But they were getting ahead, each through their own distinctive strategy. Glazer and Moynihan treated blacks and Puerto Ricans as two of New York's ethnic groups, assimilating more slowly than the Irish, the Italians and the Jews, but assimilating nonetheless. "New York will very likely in the end be an integrated area," they wrote.
This was, as it turned out, the high-water mark of Glazer's optimism; the Black Power movement was beginning to challenge the old civil rights consensus just as "Beyond the Melting Pot" appeared. In a 1965 essay, he described the typical pattern of ethnic progress and assimilation, and then wrote, "The militant Negro and his white allies passionately deny the relevance or even the truth of this history." Such critics insisted that racism was so integral to American culture that simply leveling the playing field through civil rights legislation would not be enough to give blacks a fair chance. The old demand for equality of opportunity was giving way to a new demand for equality of results -- an escalation that, Glazer felt, would lead to a new politics of resentment and competitive victimization.
Glazer passionately believed that the militants were wrong, that black prospects were improving, and that racism was not insuperable. But Glazer has always been just as interested in understanding the grounds of his adversaries' convictions as he has been in refuting those convictions. He began to realize, he says now, that the historical experience of black Americans made it impossible for them to completely absorb immigrant values. "In a way," Glazer says, "the attitude of blacks was so fully shaped by their experience of America that they could not shed it. What was available to them in terms of education and work experience that would satisfy an immigrant group would not have satisfied them. They didn't say, 'The Italians have moved up out of ditch-digging jobs; great, now we can get good ditch-digging jobs.' Their ambitions were greater than their formal capacities permitted."
During the Kennedy Administration, Glazer served with the precursor to the Housing and Urban Development department; later he worked as a consultant on the ill-fated Model Cities program. The failure of so many of the well-intentioned programs in the War on Poverty led Glazer to be deeply skeptical about sweeping schemes of reform directed by Washington -- a view he ultimately codified in an influential book, "The Limits of Social Policy." As Glazer saw it, "The breakdown of traditional modes of behavior is the chief cause of our social problems." Like Moynihan, he had come to believe that poverty had to be attacked at the level of the family; but he had less confidence than Moynihan had in government's ability to address those problems.
In 1969, Moynihan helped Glazer secure a teaching position at Harvard that was one of five created by the Ford Foundation to focus intellectual energy on the problems of the cities. But Glazer was moving further and further away from the new liberalism. In "Affirmative Discrimination," and in other essays from the time, Glazer insisted that not only would affirmative action do nothing to alleviate black poverty; it would also undermine the values that had made America's unique experiment in cultural pluralism possible. "The rising emphasis on group difference which government is called upon to correct might mean the destruction of any hope for the larger fraternity of all Americans," he wrote. Glazer insisted, as he long had, that values and behavior, not prejudicial treatment, accounted for most of the difference in outcomes among various groups.
And yet Glazer never quite fit in on the right. He refused to sign a well-known "Democrats for Nixon" ad in 1972. In fact, he voted for George McGovern, and for Jimmy Carter in 1980. And he was dovish on Israel, violating a neo-con article of faith. Glazer says that he was never asked to serve on the board of the conservative committees he had signed up for. "They felt," Glazer recalls with a hint of pride, "that I was not to be depended on -- I would see the other side, or some such thing."
In 1990, Glazer agreed to serve on a committee to revise the social studies curriculum for New York State. The group's job was to repair the damage done by the report of an earlier task force, which had denounced the Western bias of the schools and advocated a new curriculum that would focus on the achievements of marginalized peoples and on the sins of the nation's founders. The historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. also served on the committee. But Schlesinger despaired of reaching an acceptable conclusion, and ultimately responded by writing "The Disuniting of America," a passionate diatribe against the craze for multiculturalism. Glazer, characteristically, engaged with the multiculturalists, and ultimately accepted a draft with less strident language and a somewhat more balanced assessment of American history. "I couldn't find it my heart to turn against it," Glazer says.
Out of this experience came "We Are All Multiculturalists Now." In this book, which appeared last year, the note of ruefulness that had begun to creep into Glazer's work becomes almost weirdly dominant. Glazer writes, "I feel warmly attached to the old America that was acclaimed in school textbooks," and notes that he remains worried about "the fixing of lines of division on ethnic and racial bases." But he concludes that, for better or for worse, his side has lost. Among his own students, white as well as nonwhite, Glazer writes, "assimilation" has become a dirty word. And multiculturalism, with its emphasis on group identity and on building self-esteem through learning about the achievements of one's own group, has become the norm in public schools.
But "We Are All Multiculturalists Now" only appears to be about ethnicity. It is really about race. Glazer observes that the overwhelming majority of the immigrants in whose name multiculturalism is promoted are indifferent or even hostile to its tenets. Multiculturalism, he writes, is largely a black agenda; and behind Glazer's book-length shrug of the shoulders is the sense that the black feelings of exclusion he first addressed 30 years earlier had now become fixed and irremediable. "There's a tremendous alienation in this group from the notion of school, from the notion of whites, from the notion of whites telling them things," Glazer says. "They do not want to hear about things different from them that they cannot connect to; they want to hear about their lives."
Glazer sounds as if he is making a painstaking effort to fathom something that bewilders him. But it's deeply unsettling to hear the great pluralist speaking the kind of language normally associated with the outer fringes of identity politics. The truth is, Glazer hasn't had much direct contact with black children or parents.
By contrast, the sociologist Alan Wolfe interviewed dozens of black middle-class parents for his book, "One Nation, After All," and found that most favored a "five minutes on everyone" form of multiculturalism, rather than the extreme ethnocentrism that Glazer sees as the new black norm. Wolfe says that Glazer "may have confused what certain elements of the elite think with what most African-Americans think."
Wolfe describes Glazer as "a role model" for an engaged academic like himself, and speaks of him almost with reverence; and yet he says that he found "We Are All Multiculturalists Now" disturbing and "defeatist." Wolfe wonders if Glazer has been disabled by his power of sympathy. "The greatest way you can respect any group," he says, "is to argue with them and to point out when you think they're wrong." Farbrent, too, has its claims.
"We Are All Multiculturalists Now" outraged conservatives. In a review in The Weekly Standard, Dinesh D'Souza accused Glazer of "cowardice," of surrendering his principles in order to get along at Cambridge cocktail parties. But it's figures like Wolfe, who think of themselves as occupying "the vital center," embattled from the left as well as the right, who were the most deeply pained and mystified by the book. Glazer's steadfast faith in the assimilating powers of American culture had, after all, helped define that center. Jim Sleeper, author of "Liberal Racism," was appalled by Glazer's change of heart. As he puts it: "Nat is succumbing to an unspoken fatalism about black capacities and prospects. Even more egregious, it's a complete faintheartedness about a truly liberal political agenda." Diane Ravitch, a historian of education, says, "One of the things that engaged intellectuals like Nat have done has been arguing to push the world in a certain direction." Accepting a curriculum that turns history into therapy, she says, is like accepting high rates of teen pregnancy or smoking.
Glazer rejects the charge of defeatism, but behind his turnabout lies a new view not only of black aspirations but of black prospects. Glazer takes seriously the statistical evidence showing that black economic progress began to stall in the mid-70's, and has not substantially resumed. He sees this as painful proof that the immigrant model is not working. Moreover, he traces this failure, at least in part, to the unwillingness of whites to permit blacks to assimilate. Most of the people who make this argument -- people like Andrew Hacker, the author of "Two Nations" -- call for a wholesale redistribution of power and resources to overcome racial inequities. Glazer, however, has not changed his view that government activism on behalf of the poor is largely self-defeating. He is thus in the awkward position of accepting the left's diagnosis of black prospects while denying the efficacy of its proposed cure.
It is this quandary that accounts for the tone of resignation and discomfort that runs through some of Glazer's recent work. He has not changed his view that affirmative action constitutes a form of discrimination, and he says that "a lot of the arguments for affirmative action are weak and illusory." He does not see affirmative action as a solution to the gap in educational attainment; it is, like multiculturalism, a concession -- a stopgap -- that a fair-minded and sympathetic person, in the absence of anything better, ought to be willing to make. It is hard even to recognize, from this distant outpost, the optimism that once defined Glazer's politics.
And yet glazer is not a gloomy character. He is amused by the new friends he has been collecting as an icon of repentant neo-conservatism. He has recently been invited to address "Diversity Day" events at college campuses, where he gives cautionary talks about the need to avoid intolerance. At the moment, he seems to be experiencing the giddy sense of disorientation that comes of not quite knowing where you're headed.
"You begin to break with orthodoxy, and then you see other challenges to it," Glazer said to me. "They don't seem so outlandish or threatening as they once did." Raising an eyebrow at the terrifying strictures of yore, he continued: "It reminds me of the old Leninist line, 'Who says A, must say B.' From saying B, you'll go on to C, D and you'll end up at Z. There's no stopping

HEADLINE: BOOKEND; Guess Who's on the Backlist

BYLINE: By Richard Cohen; Richard Cohen is the managing director of Richard Cohen Books.

 BODY:
The received wisdom in the publishing community is that backlist -- books published some time ago but that keep on selling -- is the bread and butter on which a publishing house thrives. Ask Farrar, Straus & Giroux, with Isaac Singer, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and John McPhee, or Penguin, whose backlist regularly contributes more than 60 percent of its North American sales.
However, there can be surprises. In 1985, when I took over as trade publishing director of Hutchinson, an English publishing house, I started to research the 98 years of Hutchinson's history and discovered that (excepting best sellers by Kingsley Amis, Anthony Burgess, Ruth Rendell and Frederick Forsyth) Hutchinson had only five books over four years old that still had reasonable sales. One was a business book, "Getting to Yes," first published in 1981. Three of the others were collections of religious light verse by an American, Helen Steiner Rice. The remaining title was "Mein Kampf," Hitler's apologia, composed in prison in 1924. Its original title was "A Four-and-a-Half-Year Struggle Against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice," but Hitler's publisher, Max Amann of Franz Eher Verlag, who had been Hitler's company commander during World War I, persuaded him to use the shorter version. By the time of Hitler's death, after which publication of the book was banned, more than eight million copies had been sold in Germany. 
 Hitler had granted his German publishers world rights, and as Eher Verlag regularly used the literary agency of Curtis Brown to handle its sales in Britain, Curtis Brown took over the German Chancellor's book. As the agency says now, "He was a respectable head of state, democratically elected." In America, Eher Verlag decided to handle the rights themselves, and sold the book to Houghton Mifflin. The small firm of Hurst & Blackett, later to be subsumed into Hutchinson, bought the British rights, paying just 350. In October 1933, the book was published in an abridged version in both the United States and Britain, with a translation heavily censored by the German Embassy in London. The German version had 781 pages, the English-language edition 297. Even so, the book's main message was clear. The reviewer in The New York Times noted, "It is with sadness, tinged with fear for the world's future, that we read Hitler's hymn of hate."
In January 1939 Hutchinson published a translation of the full text. Three years later the Americans commissioned their own version, from the highly respected translator Ralph Manheim. None of this was sanctioned by Berlin. The American and British editions went ahead throughout the 1930's without any contract with the author -- almost as if war had already been declared.
After the war there was a lull. The book was seen as largely unreadable, and there was little interest in it even as a historical document. Then, toward the end of the 1950's, another literary effort by Hitler, written in the late 20's, was discovered and published as "Hitler's Secret Book." It created considerable controversy, and what Hitler had written before coming to power suddenly became a subject of interest.
By this time Hutchinson was run by the eccentric Robert Lusty, who set about resurrecting "Mein Kampf" from the backlist. The whole project took time, with various plans for either a new abridged version or a heavily annotated complete text. By the mid-60's questions about the book were being raised in the House of Commons, and sections of the British Jewish community were claiming that "Mein Kampf" would be a focus for anti-Semitism. Donald Cameron Watt, the political historian who had been commissioned by Lusty to write a new introduction, wrote an article in The Spectator accusing Hutchinson of loss of nerve. Eventually the complete text was republished, in 1969, and it has been in print in Britain ever since. Each new edition has prompted a letter of complaint from the German Government.
The questions we faced at Hutchinson were, what were a publisher's responsibilities when confronted with such a book, and should we do anything to try to increase sales? Our sales manager acknowledged it was not like selling any other work on the list but asked if we could use a slightly more attractive cover than the solemn two-color jacket the book then had, and it was arranged that at the same time we should update the blurb. The editor responsible checked the revised material with the company's new managing director, who complained that it had to be changed. The wording contained the phrase "this evil book." That wouldn't do. "We can't say a book is evil if we ourselves are publishing it," the managing director argued. The editor demurred, not least because the reprint was overdue and changes had to be kept to a minimum. By the time the final version was published, the phrase had been changed anagrammatically to "this vile book" -- a triumph of publishing economics.
"Mein Kampf" still sells its regular 3,000 copies a year in Britain. All royalties are channeled through the Curtis Brown agency, which does not take a commission but passes the money on to a suitable charity. When the agency first tried to find a recipient for the money, the West German Government refused it, and so did all Jewish charities based in Germany, regarding the royalties as tainted. Who now receives the money? Curtis Brown declines to say. As the agency explains, "If the name of the charity who receives the money were made public, they'd immediately have to announce they could no longer take it."
In America, the book has been continuously in print with Houghton Mifflin since its original publication. Until the United States entered the war, royalties were sent directly to Eher Verlag; then, under the Trading With the Enemy Act, they were paid to the State Department. In 1979 Houghton Mifflin was allowed to stop paying any royalties. By then the United States Government had received over $90,000.
In January Houghton Mifflin will publish a new edition -- the Manheim translation, but with a fresh introduction by the historian John Lukacs. Houghton Mifflin's present publisher is Wendy Strothman, who says: "It's difficult to imagine being in the position of the editors who originally decided to release a book that they profoundly disagreed with. But I admire their prescience. At that time, without the diversity of media we possess today, the book served a function that could be carried in part by other means of communication now. I'd also argue that nowadays it is one of the most powerful rebuttals we can deliver to Holocaust revisionists."
Houghton Mifflin is not publishing the book purely for academic study, but for the general reader. Shouldn't the book be published in a special way -- with the literary equivalent of a public health warning? Here Strothman is adamant: "I defer to our own First Amendment. Ideas are sometimes messy, but it's far more dangerous to suppress them in fear of their falling into the wrong hands than to reveal them for what they are."
Meanwhile, the publishing world itself is changing. In Britain, Hutchinson has long since been purchased by Random House. But dog eats dog, not always aware of what has gone to make up its meal. Random House is in the process of being purchased by the vast German conglomerate of Bertelsmann. Thus Hitler's racist tract, unavailable in German bookstores, will shortly be published throughout Britain and the Commonwealth by a German company.
THE head of Bertelsmann's North American trade book operations, Peter Olson, was surprised to learn that Bertelsmann was now the publisher of "Mein Kampf." "It certainly wasn't the motivation for buying the company," he said with a laugh. "I don't imagine anyone's going to be delighted to hear about it," he added. "I admit I have to suppress a twinge of uncomfortableness, but there's not going to be a call by me, or any of my German colleagues, telling Hutchinson they shouldn't publish it. There's not going to be any central interference on a book because of political concerns. If Hutchinson decides they don't want to publish it, that's O.K. by me. If the opposite, that's O.K. too. It's an interesting question whether Bertelsmann would choose to publish 'Mein Kampf.' Probably not."
While Bertelsmann remains secure in its policy of editorial noninterference, the fate of "Mein Kampf" is far from an academic matter in the world at large. Earlier this year, the book was banned in Portugal, the publishing house Hugin Editora having reached an agreement with the German Embassy for all copies of "Mein Kampf" to be recalled and pulped. The Federal State of Bavaria, which controls all rights to the book except the English-language editions, has also caused it to be banned in Sweden, Norway, Latvia, Switzerland and Hungary. In Israel there had never been an edition available until 1995, when Academon, an imprint of the Hebrew University, issued a limited edition. The publisher was sharply criticized, and the book is now out of print. For the time being, in Britain at least, Bertelsmann remains Hitler's publisher. Which leads to a further irony. Last year Random House purchased from Reed Elsevier the Heinemann general list. Among the backlist authors is Winston Churchill; so Churchill and Hitler may shortly nestle next to each other on Bertelsmann's backlist -- as they do on Houghton Mifflin's. "Mein Kampf" is now published by Hutchinson's sister imprint, Pimlico. There is a new blurb on the back cover -- with "this evil book" reinstated.

HEADLINE: Clinton Gamesmanship

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Leonard Garment ("Perhaps Washington Needs a Shot Clock," Op-Ed, June 23) overlooks the basic reasons that the spectators are not loudly booing the Clinton "clock-freeze" on Kenneth W. Starr, the independent prosecutor. They like the way Mr. Clinton has played the rest of the game -- the economy is healthy and the country is not at war. 
 More important, they regard the Lewinsky business as nit-picking nonsense not worthy of impeachment consideration, and the Whitewater mess as a shoddy real estate deal that happened long before Bill Clinton entered the White House. Essentially, the public perception is that Mr. Starr is not investigating the type of high crimes committed in the White House by Richard M. Nixon.
Mr. Garment views the political-cynicism issue from the perspective of the team that is losing the game. Most other people believe that Mr. Starr is playing political "gotcha" rather than exercising reasoned discretion about presumed crimes worthy of prosecution against a President.

HEADLINE: Investment Site Co-Founder Is at Home on the Internet

BYLINE: By LISA NAPOLI 

 BODY:
On a white board in the newsroom of TheStreet.com, an investment news service published on the World Wide Web, employees keep a running list titled the "self-importance meter." The entrants vary, but, inevitably, somewhere in the ranking is the name James J. Cramer.
Mr. Cramer happens to be the service's co-founder, as well as one of its marquee columnists. He writes three bombastic missives daily, dispatched via E-mail to 18,000 subscribers, under the rubric "Wrong!" 
 His reach extends well beyond the computer terminal and this has made Mr. Cramer a kind of Zelig of the information age, cutting across all media and raising the issue of his own involvement in the market as the manager of a $350 million private investment firm. Mr. Cramer, 43, appears as a commentator on "Good Morning America" on ABC, as a guest co-host on CNBC and in print with regular columns in GQ and The New York Observer; he also has alliances with on-line ventures including America Online and Yahoo.
It is the Internet, he said, that provides immediacy to match his frenetic pace, and That of the financial markets he covers. "I've been waiting for this medium to be built all my life," he said.
From the offices of his investment fund on Wall Street, he monitors the markets from a bank of computer terminals that proffer data and news, zipping off E-mail between trades in an environment which makes a typical newsroom appear sleepy.
"I'm not capable of thinking of anything in terms other than stocks," he said. He described a meeting with an executive at Disney, which owns ABC and whose Web site TheStreet.com supplies with financial news; he also recently did a television pilot for the company. "All I could think about was, "Disney's stock is down today," he recalled.
Mr. Cramer is betting on the notion that the rapid ups and downs of the stock market make for compelling Internet fare, matching the rapid-fire pace of the new medium. Mr. Cramer is hoping that the growing sector of home investors, as well as the financial professionals, who comprise 60 percent of the customers who pay $9.95 a month for his wisdom, will translate into a publishing success.
Those who follow the world of on-line business news said it would be a difficult market to win.
"You've got a huge number of competitors and some of them are extremely well funded, everything from The Wall Street Journal Online, to brokerages that are looking at ways of putting content on line," said Mike Gazala, an analyst with Forrester Research in Boston. He expressed doubt that TheStreet.com, with a staff of 30 and little brand recognition, could amass a large enough audience to succeed.
"Beyond Jim Cramer, I don't think there's much there," Mr. Gazala said. "If you took away Jim Cramer, you wouldn't have too many people visiting that 'street.' "
Clearly, Mr. Cramer remains the allure. Recently, he and his co-founder, Martin Peretz, the owner and editor in chief of The New Republic, received $10 million in venture capital financing from a syndicate led by the investment firms Flatiron Partners, Chase Capital Partners and Softbank Technology Ventures, who are now minority stakeholders in the business.
"This is a very important trend," Jerry Colonna, co-founder of Flatiron Partners, said of the quest for investment information on line. He said Mr. Cramer's cantankerous, shoot-from-the-hip style of presentation was a big reason for the investment.
Dave Kansas, editor of TheStreet.com, conceded that Mr. Cramer's involvement as manager of an investment firm presents an editorial challenge. Some prospective employees have been concerned, he conceded, that Mr. Cramer's dual life as a money manager and journalist sullies the credibility of the financial news service.
"We've had people we've tried to hire who said they're not comfortable with the perception," Mr. Kansas said.
When he first conceived of TheStreet.com, Mr. Cramer said, he approached the Securities and Exchange Commission to ask advice on how to set up the business to avoid conflict.
The issue of conflicts of interest is not a new one for Mr. Cramer. In 1995, while a contributor to Smart Money magazine, Mr. Cramer was widely criticized for an article that he wrote recommending the stocks of several small companies in which he owned large stakes. The article did not make note of those holdings. As a result of the incident, Smart Money changed its policies, restricting contributors from writing about stocks in which they own large positions or which are thinly traded and adding disclosures about the stock holdings of contributors.
At TheStreet.com, rules were instituted under which Mr. Cramer would not have any editorial control beyond his column. All his columns, writings and television appearances are accompanied by disclaimers of some kind.
That does not mean he skirts controversy, however. In January 1997, Mr. Cramer, through his fund, bought up 1.1 million shares of Dow Jones stock, and was one of three big stockholders using their investment to push the company to sell Telerate, its financial information business. He sold off most of his shares five months later when it became clear the sale would not happen. (Mr. Cramer said he took great pleasure in the fact that Dow Jones ultimately did sell Telerate earlier this year.)
For Mr. Kansas, the scrutiny of the medium in which he publishes is a bigger issue than critics of Mr. Cramer's possible conflicts. "To me, " he said, "the mainstream medium likes to harp on the potentially scary issues relating to the Internet. We have to work very hard to rise above that."

HEADLINE: Steady Growth Of Revenue Is Energizing Newspapers

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
The newspaper industry, the hypochondriac of the information age, is as healthy as it has been in a decade.
The migraine headaches brought on in the mid-1990's when the price of the industry's basic raw material, paper, jumped by 30 percent for two consecutive years, are but a memory. High-margin classified advertising is surging, bringing with it a revenue rush that is energizing the entire industry. 
 Perhaps most important, the early returns indicate that 1998 will be the first year since 1986 that the industry's ever-more-anemic circulation figures will go up, not down.
And though readers have declining trust in the accuracy of newspaper articles, investors for most of the last 18 months have shown increasing faith in newspaper company stocks -- at least until mid-April, when steady but unremarkable earnings growth made some analysts nervous about the sustainability of industry profits.
So newspaper publishers might be pardoned for the pleasure they take in the process. "Newspapers always come back," said John Carroll, the editor of The Baltimore Sun, which is owned by Times Mirror. "And newspapers do make a lot of money."
And though it is hard to find a happy hypochondriac, the old nervousness is being replaced in city after city with a certain cockiness. Some newspaper partisans, long bruised, now think they can give as good as they get.
Do William H. Gates and Microsoft want to devour the classified advertising business, luring automobile ads into their on-line Carpoint service? Let them try. Last year, newspaper companies including Knight Ridder, Times Mirror, the Tribune Company and the Washington Post Company pooled their resources to back the Chicago-based Web enterprise Classified Ventures L.L.C.
Do direct mailers want to pull more supermarkets and drugstores into their orbit? Maybe newspapers, including The Arizona Republic, seek to go direct mail one better. The Republic, owned by Central Newspapers Inc., is preparing a series of experiments in delivering advertisements to subscribers' doorsteps just as direct mailers do.
Still, for all the brave talk, the news industry cannot avoid the sobering reminders of where it stands among news consumers. About 80 percent of those surveyed in April by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, the Washington-based research organization, said they regularly watched television news, down from 81 percent in 1996. How many read newspapers? About 68 percent, down from 71 percent in 1996.
When newspaper readers were taken alone, there was a more telling gap. Younger readers in this generation have much less interest in newspapers than their counterparts in the 1960's. In 1965, a Gallup poll indicated that in the 21-to-35 age group, 67 percent of those surveyed had read a daily newspaper the day before. In 1990, a similar survey by Pew showed that number had dwindled to 39 percent. This spring, it was 31 percent. Even in the over-50 group, readership figures are down to 63 percent, from about 74 percent in 1990.
And some large advertising agencies still find that for national ads, newspapers are a cumbersome and expensive vehicle. Although newspaper revenues from national advertisers like airlines and Hollywood studios are up over the decade, "for most national advertisers, their first choice is television -- and that's getting more so," said Stacey Lippman, the media director at the New York-based advertising agency TBWA Chiat/Day, which is owned by the Omnicom Group.
The newspaper industry's standard response is that its readers are a relatively upscale demographic group compared with radio or television audiences. The Pew survey bears this out: 60 percent of those surveyed with family incomes of $75,000 annually read newspapers; 58 percent watched television news. College graduates were also slightly more likely to get their news from newspapers.
Yet while those demographics are likely to whet advertisers' appetites, editors like Gregory E. Favre of The Sacramento Bee, one of the original papers owned by the growing McClatchy Newspapers Inc., are nervous about making too many journalistic decisions based on such data.
The economic downturn of the early 1990's coincided with buyouts among retailers -- which then had no excess cash for advertising -- and competition from companies selling newspaper inserts to supermarkets and other local advertisers. The bottom line: at least 10 percent of display advertising revenues were lost; they have not returned.
Just when things might have started to move back up, newsprint prices rose by almost 70 percent, peaking in 1995 and 1996, and forcing another round of belt-tightening and price increases at newspapers. And since 1995, the various viruses that have killed dozens of evening papers picked off The Baltimore Evening Sun, The Norfolk Ledger-Star, The Rochester Times-Union and The Phoenix Gazette.
But if 1987 and 1988 were the golden years for the industry, 1997 was at least gold-plated. Total revenues, according to the figures compiled by the Newspaper Association of America, were $51.4 billion -- $41.3 billion (up 11.3 percent over 1996) from advertising, and $10.1 billion (up about 1 percent) from circulation. The overall revenue improvement is less impressive when inflation is taken into account. In real dollars, 1997 circulation revenues lagged more than 15 percent behind their 1987 high. Last year advertising revenues, led by retail display advertising and classifieds, inched back near 1987 levels.
Perhaps most important, psychologically: readers have stopped deserting. The March report from the Audit Bureau of Circulations showed widespread, though marginal, gains. The Atlanta Constitution, owned by Cox Newspapers, and The Minneapolis Star & Tribune, recently bought by McClatchy Newspapers, each picked up more than 4 percent.
Just 3 of the the top 25 circulation leaders showed declines of more than 1 percent: The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune and The Miami Herald.
By comparison, in the years from 1994 through 1996, when there were widespread price increases, overall newspaper circulation declined at an annual rate of 2 percent or more.
"Promotional spending is back," said John Murray, the newspaper association's vice president for circulation and marketing. "Your pricing is slowed so you don't have the immediate losses you'd get with a price increase. Equally important, newspapers have put much more of a focus on zoning for local news and on niche coverage -- sections on health or personal finance."
Certainly in cities like Sacramento and Phoenix, where newsrooms have been downsized over the decade, the focus is local. "I believe our major franchise is local news," said Mr. Favre, the editor of The Sacramento Bee. "We spend more of our resources on that than anything else."
Despite the industry's generally good news, a paramount concern is classified advertising. "Classifieds definitely are driving the revenue increases that we're seeing," said David G. Alley, The Republic's advertising director. And what is driving classified advertising, he said, is the tight job recruitment market.
Yet classifieds are peculiarly vulnerable to the Internet's capacity to permit one-to-one communications across great distances.
Some competitors have joined forces with newspapers. The National Association of Realtors created realtor.com, a Web site to hawk its own wares in 1996; now The San Diego Union-Tribune and USA Today, as well as NBC and America Online are its partners. Classified Ventures runs the sites apartments.com and cars.com, which feature ads from 135 daily newspapers. Realfind.com, run by the newspaper association, has links to more than 300 newspaper real estate sections.
But executives like Angus H. Twombly, the vice president for marketing and strategic planning at The Portland Press-Herald in Portland, Me., remain cautious. "I don't think it's time to be cocky," Mr. Twombly said. "We are having to adapt more in this decade than in either of the two decades before. Having this flood of classified advertising is giving us a little flexibility and a little time, but isn't buying us peace of mind."

HEADLINE: We, the People Of the Internet;
Cybercitizens Debate How to Form On-Line Union, Perfect or Otherwise

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
These are the times that try a cyberpatriot's soul.
Consider Jon Postel, who has served as the unflaggingly serene citizen-sentry of the Internet's address system since he began keeping track of it on a piece of notebook paper in 1969. But Mr. Postel is weary these days, and a little bit grumpy -- and not because the Internet has doubled in size yet again in the last year. 
 It is because Mr. Postel, a University of Southern California researcher, has recently been anointed a founding father of the network's nascent political structure -- a move toward Internet "self-governance" that is being propelled by various governmental, commercial and social forces.
For nearly three decades, Mr. Postel's work has been supported by a combination of contracts from the Federal Government and consensus by the Internet's ad hoc technical community. But now, as a de facto delegate to what is shaping up as a constitutional convention in cyberspace, Mr. Postel suddenly finds himself accused of seizing illegitimate power, threatened with lawsuits and bombarded in E-mail wars.
His critics include Jim Dixon, president of Euro Internet Service Providers Association, a trade group of 600 Internet companies in Europe. "You have a small group of people asking that they be given a large amount of power simply because they've been there for a long time," complains Mr. Dixon, noting that Europe wants more say in how the Internet will be run.
His concerns are shared by many Internet industry leaders outside the United States, who have made their feelings known to Mr. Postel and the United States Government via E-mail.
Mr. Postel cannot help but feel besieged. "I'd rather be doing the technical stuff," he said recently with a sigh. "But there are so many questions that need to get answered. How do we form a representative board? How do we make it international? How do we find enough agreement to move forward?"
Far from being Mr. Postel's private agony, these are among the questions that are bound to be debated at a meeting near Washington this week, at another in Geneva later in July and at various other caucuses, conferences and on-line sessions this summer. The partisans of the Net are working toward a Sept. 30 deadline for the United States Government to hand over control of a key portion of the Internet to an as-yet-unformed nonprofit international group.
Even for many Internet users who do not care much about the specific job at hand -- determining who gets to register whom for which types of Internet addresses -- the need to create a governing system for that task has been given a sense of urgency and common cause to representatives from the Government and industry, as well as the libertarian technologists who have historically supervised the Internet. Though they may have competing goals, all share a belief in free-flowing communication and in the value of electronic commerce, which the Department of Commerce recently reported was growing twice as fast as the rest of the economy.
While no one is sure how it should work, the idea is that a uniquely participatory medium like the Internet -- one that transcends national borders and whose fast-evolving technology can be shaped to fit social policy -- ought to be able to come up with its own semiofficial political structure. Regulation by more traditional means, the thinking goes, would stifle electronic commerce and the free flow of ideas.
The stakes are sufficiently high to elicit a recent emotional appeal from David Farber, a professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania, who is a widely respected E-mail pamphleteer with nearly 25,000 subscribers.
"If we blow it, the result will be governance by Governments with all the negatives that holds for the future evolution of the net," Professor Farber recently wrote to his E-mail constituents. "What do we do. We could act grown up!! We could coordinate the meetings and make it appear like we are organized. I wonder if the net establishment is indeed willing to be grown up, or will they fight till there is nothing left."
His recent missive was a cry from the heart. "This is a defining moment," Professor Farber said in an interview. "If we can't pull it together on something like this, governments are going to get together and decide this is too important to their economic health to leave in the hands of chaos. They'll start writing treaties, and we'll end up with a very slow mechanism."
Mr. Farber is himself an Internet founding father. He was Mr. Postel's thesis adviser in 1969 and assigned his student the task of cataloguing Internet addresses. That academic exercise eventually became a full-time job as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, financed by the Department of Defense. While Network Solutions Inc., a Reston, Va., company, has had an exclusive Government contract to register addresses under the most popular domains -- the suffixes on Internet addresses like ".com," ".net" and ".org" -- Mr. Postel has been responsible for insuring that each address corresponds to a unique string of digits that all of the Internet's computers can recognize.
And now Mr. Postel finds himself being swept toward that Sept. 30 deadline -- the date the Clinton Administration recently set for handing over control of the distribution of Internet addresses to whatever international nonprofit group has formed by then. The Administration's report on the matter earlier this month prompted the announcement of at least two meetings by competing factions, with others rumored to be in the works. One, to take place in Reston, Va., begins on Wednesday. The other, in Geneva, will start July 21.
With the Administration and industry seeming to have more faith in technology and market forces to regulate cyberspace than legislation, the effort to supervise Internet addresses has become the first test of the self-governance movement.
The parties with cross-cutting interests include large trademark holders, who want to limit the number of domains -- ".com," ".net" and ".org" -- to reduce the opportunities for others to co-opt their brand names. It is one thing for Coca-Cola (www.coke.com) to make sure no one is trying to do business as www.coke.org. It might be far harder to police dozens of domains, to ferret out coke.web or coke.store, for example. But small businesses and individuals would like to see more domains created to increase the odds of obtaining their own preferred addresses. Meanwhile, there are many entrepreneurs intent on making a profit out of registering domain names -- and perhaps just as many domain democrats who would rather see registration be a strictly nonprofit enterprise.
To some extent, the struggle is also between the old-guard technical wizards like Mr. Postel and the new commercial interests that have begun to assert themselves as the Internet expands. Tamar Frankel, a law professor at Boston University who has taken a leading role in organizing this week's conference in Reston, has been accused by some Internet traditionalists of being an interloper with no credentials -- or worse, a promoter for Network Solutions Inc., a unit of the Science Applications International Corporation, which assigns the domain names that Mr. Postel helps catalogue.
To such criticism, Ms. Frankel replies: "The issues now before the Internet are not technical. They are political, they are structural, they are organizational. What I find is that people who are tremendously sophisticated in the technical workings of the Internet are not necessarily knowledgeable in how to create an organization -- especially one that has no clear model."
But a growing number of academics, industry and Government officials and so-called netizens who are not entirely convinced that a new electronic order will emerge on its own have begun to seek a clear structure for the process. Today, for example, Martin Bangemann, the European Union Commissioner for Industry, is convening a conference in Brussels for industry representatives to discuss his proposal for an international charter to coordinate Internet regulation of electronic commerce. Next month, the faculty of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard will discuss the subject.
"The Internet overlaps with geographical governments, but it also floats above them," Joseph Nye, dean of the Kennedy School, said. "So trying to work out governance is quite difficult, and no analogy quite fits."
Ira Magaziner, a senior White House policy adviser, was the chief architect of the recently issued hands-off policy on domain names. "What we believe is the ideal kind of coordinating structure of the Internet is not to have an intergovernmental organization, but to have a number of private nonprofit international groups that have specific charters," Mr. Magaziner said.
But so far private industry has made little progress in self-regulation. Some critics say that even an effective industry effort would not necessarily safeguard the principles of democracy. "My fear is that there won't be any accountability," said Andrew L. Shapiro, a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Harvard. "Your common Internet user doesn't know diddly about Internet domain name registration, and those people need to be represented. It runs the risk of being intensely skewed toward private, for-profit interests."
But some proponents of self-governance argue that the participatory nature of the Internet will allow a bottom-up approach to decision-making that has little precedent in the world of parliaments and industrialists. David R. Johnson, director of the Internet Policy Project at the Aspen Institute in Washington, points to Mr. Farber's call for peace as an example of what he calls the Internet's tendency toward natural "self-ordering." After Mr. Farber sent out his appeal he received vows of cooperation from many sides. There is talk of a series of meetings around the world, to which various factions would send delegates.
"See, one of our senior moral leaders calls on the Net to grow up and there's already progress in that direction," said Mr. Johnson, a lawyer who was influential in drafting the Government's domain-name policy.
Drawing on recent research at the Santa Fe Institute and elsewhere that holds that any complex system, whether technological or biological, will spontaneously order itself, Mr. Johnson predicts that the Internet will produce its own social order -- one that, because it arises from the network itself, will have its own legitimacy. Such an order would not rely on the delegation of state power to representatives, but rather on contractual agreements between Internet users who would then be responsible for their own decisions.
"Some people mean by self-regulation a small number of industry players adopting voluntarily or even under duress some codes that match what the Government could legislate," Mr. Johnson said. "What I think the Net holds out as a possibility is a very different mechanism."

HEADLINE: Catherine Kennedy, 51, Dies; Ran Home for AIDS Patients

BYLINE: By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE 

 BODY:
Catherine Kennedy, who after a long struggle established one of the nation's first nursing centers for AIDS patients, died on Tuesday at her home in New Haven. She was 51.
The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, family members said. 
 Not long after moving to New Haven with her family in 1983, Mrs. Kennedy became aware of the lack of nursing centers and services for people with AIDS. Many were turned away by nursing homes. Some were being kept, at enormous expense, at hospitals essentially unequipped to treat them. Others were homeless.
She resolved to open a nursing center for AIDS patients but constantly encountered obstacles. She waged an eight-year struggle against financial and political obstacles to establish the home. Her experiences, which became a case study for the Harvard Business School, exemplified how someone involved in social entrepreneurship could overcome great odds.
After two years of research and attempts to raise money, she received a $60,000 grant from the Merck Family Fund. When she sought help from the State Legislature, she encountered indifference and fear of AIDS among the public, as well as hostility from legislators more interested in cutting health-care funds than increasing them.
But she gained the help of Lucie McKinney, the widow of Representative Stewart McKinney, who had died of AIDS, to plead her case with Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
The Governor was persuaded and, with others, gained passage of a bill to provide special funding for her project that included daily patient costs that were substantially less than full hospitalization and $3 million to renovate an old factory in New Haven.
In 1995, the home opened in the reconverted factory as Leeway Inc.; Mrs. Kennedy ran it until last fall, when she was forced to resign because of her illness. In that time about 150 patients have been treated.
Catherine Urwin Kennedy was born on Feb. 12, 1947 in Wallsend, England. She received a bachelor of arts in economics and a master's in economic history from the University of East Anglia in England, where she later taught. She also earned a master's degree at Yale's school of management.
She married Paul Kennedy, the author and Yale historian, in 1967. Besides her husband, she is survived by three sons, James and Matthew, of New Haven, and John, of New York, and two brothers and two sisters, all of England.
It was through her affiliation withYale that she was able to apply for her patients' participation in the university's experimental research in AIDS medication and treatment.
Mrs. Kennedy's original goal was to build a home to shelter and care for dying patients. But today, Leeway staff members said, nearly half of the patients can be sent home with reasonable chances of survival. Among them was Fred Tyson, who is going back to work as a casting director in Hollywood.
"She got us involved," he said of Catherine Kennedy. "And I truly believe I would not be alive if it weren't for her."

HEADLINE: True Delbert Morse, 102, an Eisenhower Official

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
True Delbert Morse, a former Agriculture Department Under Secretary and an architect of agricultural price support policy, died on June 3 at a retirement home in Sun City, Ariz. He was 102 years old.
He served in the Agriculture Department during the Eisenhower Administration and was also president then of the Commodity Credit Corporation, the multibillion-dollar agricultural price support program. 
 Mr. Morse was born into a farm family near Carthage, Mo., in 1896. He started a 400-acre dairy farm to support himself at the College of Agriculture at the University of Missouri, where he graduated in 1924. Upon graduation, he joined Doane Agricultural Service in St. Louis, which provided farm appraisals, agricultural research and also had an editorial service that produced feature articles for farm publications. Mr. Morse became president of Doane in 1943, editor of The Doane Agricultural Digest and later the company's chairman.
During Mr. Morse's tenure at Doane, he also performed a study for an Arizona governor's committee that resulted in the allocation of Colorado River water to Arizona and led to the Central Arizona Project, a $3 billion venture that was intended to bring Colorado River water to Phoenix, Tucson and Arizona cotton farmers.
Originally a Democrat, Mr. Morse switched his party affiliation and became head of the National Republican Farm Committee for Dewey in 1948 and, in 1952, contributed to the Republican platform's farm plank. At that time, he became acquainted with Ezra Taft Benson, the Eisenhower choice for Agriculture Secretary, who picked Mr. Morse as his Under Secretary.
In 1953, he was confirmed as Under Secretary as well as head of the Commodity Credit Corporation, which provides loans to support farm prices. In that capacity, he was the chief United States delegate in negotiating international commodity treaties for wheat and sugar. He opposed government regulation of agricultural properties in the years after World War II, and warned about the dangers of inflation and speculation in farmland from the abnormal agricultural profits of that era.
Mr. Morse left Government service in 1961.
Mr. Morse's wife, Mary Hopkins, died in 1983, and his son, James, died in 1993. He is survived by three grandsons, and six great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Rubin Could Find China The Easiest Part of His Trip

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, June 28

 BODY:
Visiting China may pose thorny political issues for President Clinton. But for Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who peeled off from the White House delegation today to visit Asian countries with troubled economies, China could turn out to be the smoothest part of his trip.
Arriving here this evening Mr. Rubin had to face a fresh volley of the continuing criticism of the United States from Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, who accused the American Government of plotting with Wall Street to take over Asian economies. 
 "They accuse us of practicing cronyism," Dr. Mahathir said on Saturday in a speech at a political gathering here. "The cooperation between the U.S. Government and Wall Street is cronyism."
Dr. Mahathir, a relentless critic of the West, drew world attention in October, when he delivered a denunciation of George Soros and the fraternity of global financiers. He blames the financial crisis on currency traders, who, he says, played havoc with the region's currencies. And he says the United States Government is standing by while Wall Street buys Asian companies at fire-sale prices.
For Mr. Rubin, a Wall Street executive before moving to Washington, such charges are a painful reminder that the Asian financial crisis is generating intense frustration among some leaders in the region. The message that Mr. Rubin is expected to deliver on Monday in a meeting with Dr. Mahathir is quite unlikely to soothe his feelings.
"The international community has a great deal of work to do," Mr. Rubin said in a briefing on his flight from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur. "These problems are not going to be solved quickly. But it is absolutely imperative that we deal with these problems and work with the countries that are affected."
Mr. Rubin's trip began on a positive note, with assurances from Chinese leaders that they do not plan to devalue their currency, the yuan. But now he is in Southeast Asia, which has suffered a wave of crippling devaluations. In addition to Malaysia, he will travel to Thailand and South Korea.
Mr. Rubin declined to discuss specific remedies for Malaysia before his meetings on Monday. But the Treasury Department generally favors the International Monetary Fund economic prescription for Asia, which calls for tight fiscal and monetary policy, coupled with a wholesale reform of the banking system and the often corrupt relationships between executives and officials.
Critics contend, though, that the cure has worsened the pain in Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand. By insisting that those countries maintain stable currencies, even if that means raising interest rates, the critics say the I.M.F. has choked off credit to businesses. The economies of all three countries contracted in the first quarter of the year, and analysts say they are sliding into severe recessions.
Malaysia has not asked for the help of the I.M.F., though it has adopted a plan with features like those that the fund requires. Like its neighbors, Malaysia has an economy that shrank in the first quarter, a 1.8 percent contraction that was all the more traumatic because it followed 6.9 percent expansion in the previous quarter.
The reversal in fortunes has sparked a remarkable public debate at the top levels of the Government. On one side is Dr. Mahathir, who argues that the central bank should lower interest rates to jump-start the economy.
On the other side is Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who opposes such a step because he fears that it would erode the Malaysian currency, the ringgit.
Mr. Anwar has long been regarded as Dr. Mahathir's probable successor. But political experts here said the dispute had frayed their relationship. Last week Dr. Mahathir appointed another close adviser, Daim Zainuddin, to a new Cabinet post to oversee the economy. Economic trouble-shooting had been Mr. Anwar's brief, and it is unclear how he will emerge from this shakeup.
"The debate over interest rates is really part of a broader debate over globalism versus nationalism," said one executive here, who insisted on anonymity. "Anwar still has faith in the global markets, while Mahathir is playing to nationalist sentiments."
As a leading emissary for the global economy, Mr. Rubin will have to wade into this debate, if only for a day. He met briefly with Mr. Anwar this evening and will hold separate meetings on Monday with Mr. Anwar and Dr. Mahathir. Mr. Zainuddin will participate in at least one session.
Analysts say the internal tensions have been aggravated by the turmoil in nearby Indonesia, where President Suharto was forced out after economic hardship led to riots and looting. Although Malaysia's situation is nowhere near as dire as that of Indonesia, analysts said Dr. Mahathir was deeply concerned about the unrest that can stem from deprivation.
For his part, Mr. Rubin said he would focus on a "social safety net," which he said was critical "so that you can maintain your public and political support for what needs to be done."
"You've got wrenching changes in countries that are in very difficult circumstances," he said.

HEADLINE: Alioune Blondin Beye, 59, Envoy for U.N.

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Alioune Blondin Beye, a United Nations envoy on a diplomatic mission aimed at averting renewed bloodshed in Angola, was apparently killed on Friday night in the crash of a light plane near Abidjan, the capital of the Ivory Coast. He was 59 and was based in Lusaka, Zambia.
The authorities at the crash scene yesterday did not make official identification of the remains found by a search team near the wreckage of the plane, a chartered twin-turboprop Beechcraft 200, which went down in an area of forests and mangrove swamps. 
 But searchers found passports belonging to Mr. Beye, a Malian, and others who had been on the plane. Reuters reported that the plane had been flying from Togo to Abidjan carrying Mr. Beye and five other members of the United Nations observer mission in Angola. It also had three crew members on board, officials in Togo said.
A United Nations spokeswoman in New York, Judith Modeste, said yesterday: "The rescue team reached the site of the crash, collected the passports, but there was no evidence of survivors. They have called off the rescue efforts for today and will continue on Monday."
On Saturday, Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations said Mr. Beye had been "traveling in the region in yet another attempt to seek support of African leaders in overcoming the present crisis" over the agreement that ended Angola's long civil war.
A former Foreign Minister of Mali, Mr. Beye was a highly regarded lawyer, diplomat and political figure, known for his energy and quick-wittedness. In 1993 he was designated by Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Mr. Annan's predecessor as Secretary General, as his special representative for Angola.
Mr. Beye began mediating efforts toward peace between Angolan rebels and the Angolan Government. He oversaw the negotiations that led to a 1994 peace agreement under which the rebel group known as the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita, agreed to yield control of the large area it had taken over during Angola's more than two decades of intermittent civil war.
But the rebel group has lagged in carrying out its obligations under the pact, and last month Mr. Beye threatened to quit his envoy's post. He contended that neither Unita nor the Angolan Government possessed the "political will" necessary to see peace efforts through to conclusion.
Before being named as a United Nations envoy, Mr. Beye held various posts. He was Mali's Minister of Youth, Sports, Arts and Culture in 1977 before serving as Foreign Minister from 1978 to 1986. He was legal counsel to the President of Mali from 1986 to 1988, and in subsequent years he was Secretary General of the African Development Bank in Abidjan and the head of its legal department.
He lectured on international public law at the University of Dijon, France, and was a member of the Dijon bar. He was also a professor at the National School of Administration in Bamako, Mali, and appeared in Malian courts as chief of the Government legal department.
He was married and had four children.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. in a Jam Over Move Against Teamster Election

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
With a Federal monitor asserting that he cannot supervise the teamsters' presidential election because Congress has cut off his financing, Republicans in Congress are finding themselves in a pickle.
Not only do Congressional Republicans appear to be blocking a monitor whose job is to prevent election fraud in a union long synonymous with corruption, but the financing cutoff is alarming James P. Hoffa, the front-running candidate who is considered friendlier to the Republicans than are the union's current leaders. 
 The Hoffa forces fear that the decision to bar financing could delay the vote for months and could result in an election that is run by anti-Hoffa incumbents rather than the Federal monitor.
"We don't trust the current administration to conduct a fair election," Thomas Pazzi, Mr. Hoffa's campaign manager, said. "There is no evidence they would do so."
Congress, however, does not want taxpayers to pay for a union election, and many teamster officials say that Congressional Republicans are also trying to punish the union because it has backed Democrats in recent elections.
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters is being run by Tom Sever, the secretary-treasurer, who was elected on the slate led by Ron Carey, the union president who is on a leave of absence while under investigation in a campaign-finance scandal.
Mr. Carey narrowly beat Mr. Hoffa in the 1996 race, but that victory was nullified and a new election was ordered when Federal monitors discovered that Carey aides siphoned more than $700,000 in teamster money to help his campaign.
In the new election, ballots are scheduled to be mailed out in September and counted on Oct. 14. But Michael G. Cherkasky, the Federal monitor, said he had so little money that vendors would not sign contracts with his office to do needed activities, like print the ballots.
Last Thursday, he filed an urgent request with Judge David Edelstein of Federal District Court in Manhattan, asking him to order the Federal Government and the union to agree on a plan by Tuesday to finance his office. Mr. Cherkasky asserted that the financial crisis would jeopardize the long-standing Federal effort to clean up the teamsters.
In his appeal, he wrote, "It would be astounding, and a stunning waste of decades of effort spent fighting organized crime and labor racketeering, if the current paralysis over funding resulted in the abandonment of this law-enforcement effort."
Under a 1989 consent decree that the teamsters signed to settle a racketeering lawsuit, the union agreed to hold elections every five years and to allow Government supervision of the union and its elections.
The consent decree required the Federal Government to pay for supervision in the 1996 election. But Congressional Republicans, led by Representative Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, were so angry about the Carey campaign-finance scandal and about having taxpayers finance a union election that they barred money for supervision.
Some teamster officials say that in orchestrating the financing prohibition, Mr. Hoekstra was trying to hurt the Carey camp and bolster Mr. Hoffa. But the cutoff has hurt Mr. Hoffa instead.
Steven Trossman, a spokesman for Mr. Hoffa's main opponent, Tom Leedham, said, "It's ironic that Congressman Hoekstra, with the Hoffa forces cheering him on, has made a mess of funding this election."
The Federal Court of Appeals in Manhattan has ruled that the Government must pay to conduct the election if it chooses to supervise the vote. The court left the alternative that the Government could choose not to supervise the election and let the union conduct and pay for it. That alternative is opposed by Mr. Cherkasky, the Justice Department, the teamster incumbents and Mr. Hoffa.
Justice Department officials say they are lobbying Congress to agree to provide the $8.6 million Mr. Cherkasky says he needs.
Some officials who are following the negotiations said that Congressional Democrats who originally supported financing the monitor's office have been strangely quiet about the money. These officials suggest that the Democrats are happy to see the Republicans stew over the matter.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Hoekstra said he was reluctant to make money available because Mr. Cherkasky, in his view, has not done enough to stop teamster officials from using union resources and money to help their preferred candidates. He has also indicated he would like Mr. Cherkasky to remove Mr. Sever from office for participating in the campaign-finance fraud. Teamster officials deny that Mr. Sever has had any involvement.
Mr. Cherkasky has said that he has no power to suspend Mr. Sever and that he was already working hard to prevent the misuse of union resources in the campaign.
But Mr. Hoekstra is skeptical. "My concern here is with the taxpayer," he said. "The system is not yet in place to conduct a fair election. I don't want to pour another dollar or $8 million into an election that in three or six months we'll have to overturn again. That sounds pretty dumb to me."

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Congress Breaks for the Fourth, Perhaps Content to Forgo Fireworks

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28

 BODY:
Congress has left town for its Fourth of July recess, seemingly content that the annual negotiations over how to spend the taxpayers' money will resolve themselves to everyone's benefit in this election year.
But battles loom over a number of issues, some of them old, like home heating assistance for the poor, and some new, like how to conduct the census in 2000. 
 There are only 35 legislative days before Congress adjourns on Oct. 9, and even less time before the next fiscal year begins on Oct. 1. By then, 13 different spending bills must be signed into law to keep the Government running.
Views vary as to how it will all come out. The Clinton Administration likes to portray the Republicans in the House as extremists, ready to throw the Government into chaos at a moment's notice.
"The placid surface conceals a very, very turbulent time ahead," said one Democratic negotiator.
But many others involved with the spending bills on Capitol Hill say there is little appetite for chaos in an election year. Even the conservatives seem reluctant to shut down the Government, as they did to disastrous political effect in 1995.
Representative Sherwood Boehlert, a moderate Republican from Utica, N.Y., said, "The wingers -- the right wing, the left wing -- are getting most of the attention, but the moderates are shaping public policy."
House and Senate committees are still working separately on the bills and have not begun to negotiate their vast differences. They have to do that before presenting their final proposals to the President, who has his own set of priorities.
Some of the early skirmishing has a familiar ring. As they have since they came to power in 1995, the Republicans, whose strength derives from the South and West, have proposed lopping off programs that benefit urban dwellers in the Northeast. This includes financing for Amtrak.
They have proposed cutting heating aid for the poor, summer jobs for disadvantaged youth, and several environmental and education programs dear to President Clinton. They would also knock out Americorps, the national service program, and the Legal Services Corporation, which provides lawyers for the poor.
But this year offers some twists.
Perhaps the biggest change is that both Congress and the Administration are living under a virtual freeze on new spending because of last year's balanced-budget agreement. The spending limits are the guiding principle -- not the projected budget surplus and strong economy, which, along with talk of tax cuts, give the false impression that Washington has lots of extra money on its hands.
In reality, the budget agreement barely allows for inflation. And tax cuts can come only from entitlements, not from the discretionary spending that is the subject of the 13 appropriations bills. So spending, a favorite election-year activity, is limited this year, prompting members to be especially creative.
Republicans have shown that, despite their complaints about past Democratic pork-barrel spending, they are just as eager to direct money to hometown projects.
The spending bills include billions of dollars spread across most districts and states for local projects such as refurbishing courthouses, controlling floods and beach erosion, providing construction work for the Army Corps of Engineers, keeping open military bases that the Administration wants to shut, and financing 22 projects, like better dining halls, at various military installations. Most are in the home states of members of the House and Senate appropriations committees.
The Republicans have also included big-ticket items for high-ranking members, like money for a helicopter carrier to be built by Litton Industries in a shipyard in Pascagoula, Miss., the hometown of Senator Trent Lott, the Republican leader, and millions of dollars for cargo planes to be built by Lockheed Martin Corp. in Marietta, Ga., the hometown of Speaker Newt Gingrich.
The Republicans have earmarked new money for basic medical research, granting the National Institutes of Health a whopping increase of 9 percent over its current budget. They would provide more money to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more for anti-drug programs to counter their failure to pass anti-tobacco legislation, and would expand Federal mortgages for low-income home buyers.
Democrats have not complained about these priorities as much as they have complained about the Republican cuts. Most notably, they have highlighted the conservatives' recurring attempt to block money for the National Endowment for the Arts. But Republican moderates in the House have joined with Democrats to keep the money in, signaling that the moderates -- 40 to 60 members of the House, depending on the issue -- could have a strong say in the final spending proposals.
One of the most contentious issues shaping up is not a spending matter but one of the many policy rulings that are often tucked into spending bills. This is the question of the census. Republicans want an exact head count. Democrats want to use statistical sampling, which would make up for people who are hard to find, like blacks in the inner city, Hispanic migrant workers and the homeless. This matters to both parties because the census determines Congressional boundaries for the next decade and determines how much Federal aid each region receives.
How these conflicts will be resolved may depend on the answers to some central questions:
How deeply split will the Republicans be? Will the conservatives and the moderates compromise -- with each other and the Administration?
And how much sway does President Clinton have on Capitol Hill? How readily will he meld his views with those of the Republican majority? Perhaps most important, which issues will he be willing to fight for?

HEADLINE: Straight Talk in Beijing

 BODY:
President Clinton's forthright language on individual freedom and Tibet has helped quiet American fears that China would exploit his presence to sanitize its abysmal human rights record. On Saturday Mr. Clinton characterized the Chinese Government's use of force against the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrators as "wrong," listed "freedom of speech, association and religion" as necessary components of national success and urged a dialogue with the Dalai Lama over Tibet. 
 Mr. Clinton's remarks at Beijing University, and the lively question-and-answer session that followed, continued to explore the theme of human rights. His declaration to the students that democracy is the "mandate of the new century" used the language of Chinese history to make a contemporary political point. While the speech itself could have been more pointed, the ripple effect in China of the weekend's events should not be underestimated.
The formal summit produced the usual agreements on issues from Chinese missile exports to the Asian financial crisis. Most were mainly symbolic, including the pledge by Beijing and Washington to stop targeting nuclear missiles at each other.
Far more important was Mr. Clinton's human rights message to audiences in China and the United States. In a notable departure, Chinese television aired his Saturday give-and-take with President Jiang Zemin live and uncensored. That welcome innovation probably reflected China's gratitude for the Clinton Administration's persistence in seeking better relations despite strong, and sometimes justified, criticism in the United States. After he returns home, Mr. Clinton will still be obliged to account for his Administration's lax monitoring of satellite sales. Also, Mr. Jiang's public denials of any attempts to influence American politics do not remove the need for a thorough investigation.
China's future human rights performance will also affect the relationship. While Mr. Clinton spoke plainly on that issue, encouraging Chinese citizens who want a freer society, Mr. Jiang's responses evoked familiar justifications of past and present repression. Chinese leaders may now be somewhat more relaxed about American human rights criticism, but they still run an unyielding police state.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton, at Beijing University, Presses Call for Liberty

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Monday, June 29

 BODY:
President Clinton proclaimed personal freedom the "mandate of the new century" in a broad defense of human and economic liberty today in a speech at Beijing University.
In his last public appearance in the Chinese capital, the President said the United States did not seek to impose its vision of society on China or any other nation. 
 "But we are convinced that certain rights are universal," the President said, "not American rights or European rights or rights for developed nations, but the birthrights of people everywhere, now enshrined in the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights -- the right to be treat with dignity, the right to express one's opinion, to choose one's own leaders, to associate freely with others and to worship, or not, freely, however one chooses."
Administration officials called today's speech, which was carried live on Chinese television, a philosophical discourse addressed directly to the Chinese people, after a weekend that featured a remarkable series of public and private discussions with President Jiang Zemin, and a visit to Beijing's largest Protestant church.
Speaking to several hundred students and faculty members in a freshly painted auditorium at China's most prestigious university, Mr. Clinton sought to broaden his audience from the Chinese leadership to a new generation that will shape the future of the most populous country on earth. Beijing University, which is celebrating its centennial this year, has been the nurturing ground of successive movements for political change in China.
He said liberty was not a luxury to be enjoyed only by wealthy nations, but a necessary element of human and economic development.
Acknowledging China's centuries-old fear of internal disintegration, he said all societies craved stability.
But, he said, personal freedom strengthens a nation's security, rather than undermining it, as the Communist Government has maintained.
"We believe, and our experience demonstrates, that freedom strengthens stability and helps nations to change," Mr. Clinton said. "China's greatest source of strength resides in the minds and hearts of its citizens. It is therefore profoundly in your interest, and the world's, that young Chinese minds be free to reach the fullness of their potential. This is the message of our time and the mandate of the new century and the new millennium."
He hailed the rapid economic growth that has swept across China in the last decade, as the Government has loosened controls on private entrepreneurship and begun to close down inefficient state-owned enterprises. He said growing incomes brought more options to the Chinese people: foreign travel, access to cable television and the Internet, new career opportunities, a higher standard of living.
"But true freedom includes more than economic freedom," the President said. "In America, we believe it is a concept which is indivisible."
Mr. Clinton spoke for 30 minutes, then took questions for another half hour.
Asked whether the United States sought to isolate China through security agreements with Japan and arms sales to Taiwan, he answered: "It is not fair to say that either Japan or the United States have a security relationship that is designed to contain China," and added that American policy posed no obstacle to the peaceful reunification of China and Taiwan.
Another student followed up with one of many surprisingly challenging questions, this one about whether the President, despite his smile, intended to pursue a policy of containment of China.
"The answer is no," Mr. Clinton said. "I'm not hiding another design behind the smile. That's what I really believe."
Another questioner asked whether there remained problems in the United States in realizing it ideals of democracy and human liberty.
Mr. Clinton replied that the United States is still plagued by violent crime and racial and sex discrimination. "So we Americans need to be sensitive not only to preserve the freedoms that we hold dear, but also to create an environment in which people can build a truly good and free life," he said.
Mr. Clinton appeared somewhat taken aback by the students' suspicions about American motives in engaging the Chinese leadership in discussions while continuing to support Taiwan and maintaining a strong strategic alliance with Japan.
The Beijing University speech offered a coda to a series of weekend meetings with President Jiang and other top Government leaders here.
On Sunday evening, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang continued their dialogue at a private dinner, exploring in greater depth the growth of the United States-China relationship and possible paths of China's future.
The dinner was the last meeting of the two Presidents on Mr. Clinton's nine-day, five-city visit to China, which has seen a significant step forward in relations both between the two nations and between their leaders. Aides called the evening "very casual and very lively."
The dinner, in the Zhongnanhai compound for Beijing's political elite, included discussion of the Asian financial crisis, development of an independent judiciary in China and American movies.
"They went way beyond what people thought were the possibilities of having this kind of discussion," Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said of the two days of meetings between the two Presidents. "We have moved the relationship into a qualitatively and quantitatively different direction."
Ms. Albright and other American officials were still clearly elated by the news conference on Saturday in which Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang engaged in an animated debate on topics that for years were not the subject of public discussion -- religious freedom, Tibet and the role of the individual and the state.
"The press conference was a truly remarkable event and one that is going to have long-term repercussions -- positive ones," Ms. Albright said in a session with reporters at the Diaoyutai state guest compound here. But in a reminder that not everything has changed in China, American security officials had posted a notice on the wall of the room where Ms. Albright spoke, reading, "The walls have ears."
Ms. Albright and two other American officials -- Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, and James Sasser, the Ambassador to China -- said today that 600 million Chinese had seen the news conference, carried live on China Central Television, the state network.
That number seemed a significant exaggeration, given that there are an estimated 300 million television sets in China and there was no advance notice that the news conference would be carried live. It was difficult to find Chinese who had seen the live broadcast, and state television rebroadcast only selected portions.
Earlier on Sunday, the President and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, attended services at Chongwenmen Church, the largest officially sanctioned Protestant church in Beijing, with more than 2,000 members. The congregation gave Mr. Clinton a bilingual Bible and asked him to speak to the overflow crowd.
"We celebrate with you the growth of the practice of our faith in China," Mr. Clinton said in remarks that lasted less than five minutes. "I believe our faith calls upon us to seek unity with people across the world with different backgrounds and races and creeds."
The Clintons and their daughter, Chelsea, spent Sunday afternoon touring the Forbidden City and the section of the Great Wall at Mutianyu. The authorities cleared the Forbidden City complex for the Clintons, only the third time they have done so, American officials said. The previous times were for a tour by President Richard M. Nixon and for the making of the film "The Last Emperor."
Mr. Clinton called the wall "quite unbelievable."

HEADLINE: The More the Books, The Fewer the Editors;
As Publishing Pressures Rise, So Do Errors

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
In the winter, Wally Lamb typed the last period of his aptly named manuscript, "I Know This Much Is True." He slumped to his knees, touched his forehead to the floor and, he recalled, tearfully thanked "whatever had allowed me to finish the story without killing me first."
By the time his novel hit the nation's bookstores this month, Mr. Lamb, a best-selling author, had recruited a freelance editor, hired a personal copy editor and turned the work over to his editor at a top publishing house who was so preoccupied with other sales and marketing duties that she confessed she longed to quit. 
 "It's all become a big, fat, screaming, mean, vicious, greedy, rude and crude fest," said Judith Regan, Mr. Lamb's editor and publisher at Regan Books, an imprint of HarperCollins. "So little of your time is spent doing creative work that I'm seriously considering leaving."
These days, an editor's sharp pencil can be a luxury in the consolidating industry of large trade publishing houses, which through the 1990's have undergone a significant contraction in their editing staffs. These are the editors who shape, tighten and polish American literature and the copy editors who detect grammatical gaffes and rescue writers from creative spelling.
In this decade, the work force of book publishing professionals in New York, who are largely editors, has declined by 16 percent, to 2,714 from 3,218, according to data from the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. But at the same time, the number of books published in the United States has surged, and so have the complaints about the quality of books carefully bound for posterity with dangling modifiers, typographical errors and misspelled words.
With publishing cycles compressed, leaving less time for editing, and editors distracted by other corporate duties like acquiring new titles, writers are increasingly recruiting hired pens -- independent editors who sharpen text or copy editors who correct grammar, inconsistencies and spelling errors for fees ranging from $1,000 to $25,000.
"I see every level of error: typographical, syntactical, factual and lack of internal consistency," said Elizabeth Sifton, a veteran editor at Farrar, Straus & Giroux, who worries that old-fashioned practitioners of the art of editing are coming to be regarded as woolly mammoths.
The decline of editing standards in American literature is an enduring lament, one that tainted even Maxwell Perkins, the celebrated editor of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. In 1920, he published "This Side of Paradise" with so many errors that a newspaper columnist made a parlor game of spotting mistakes.
And some publishers speculate that today's complaints are simply a subtext for deeper fears in an industry that has been roiled by consolidations like the merger of Random House and Bantam Doubleday Dell by the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann and the breakup and sale of Simon & Schuster's education division to Pearson P.L.C. of Britain.
Stephen Rubin, the president and publisher of Doubleday, said that some prominent authors resist editing, which affects the quality of the outcome. "I think that clearly we're in a period of momentous change on various levels, and I think people are terrified of change," he said. "And when they start whining, they're throwing editing into it. In some cases they're justified, and in some cases they're not."
The staffing level of editors is not a topic that large publishing houses dwell on, with few ever publicly revealing cutbacks. For example, Bantam Doubleday Dell does not disclose employment figures. Stuart Applebaum, a company spokesman, said he could not recall a period of deep reductions among the industry's ranks of editors and suggested that the editing staff might actually have expanded at his company with the creation of a new publishing imprint.
That view, however, is not shared by many writers and agents. Although complaints about editing may be as old as clay tablets, there is a new edginess, which has inspired counterstrategies.
Authors with a yearning for the romantic ideal of an editor as a confessor and critic are recruiting informal editors to shape up their manuscripts before submitting them to publishers -- a defensive effort to prevent early rejection or late cancellation for unsatisfactory work.

Less Time, More Pressure
Literary agents are also beginning to offer the services of in-house editors or are urging clients to hire their own editors. And the top publishing houses are continuing their practice of contracting with independent editors when their employees are too busy to do the work.
Speeded by computer technology, manuscripts that were more leisurely published in a standard nine months after submission are now edited, corrected and printed in as little as four to six months. (Authors are encouraged to submit manuscripts on computer floppy disks, which accelerates the process.) Editors are expected not only to improve prose but also to acquire books and shepherd titles through meetings on marketing, sales and publicity.
"There's much more pressure," said Peter Gethers, an editor at Random House who just started the company's Library of Contemporary Thought series of novella-length books. The window of opportunity for editing has shortened. "Every publishing company is on a 3-, 6- or 12-month business plan," he said. "And so if you get a big book and it's not perfect, you're being pressured from all sides. It's not that you can't fix it, but there are others who want it out."
Mr. Lamb, the author, hired a copy editor at the suggestion of his literary agent, Linda Chester, who estimates that within the last two years almost 60 percent of her clients have hired their own editors.
 
Bringing In Outside Editors
"If it's not 100 percent, I bring in an outside editor," Ms. Chester said of the quality of manuscripts. "Publishers should be allowing clients to do the best possible work that they can so that their books can be read for generations, but what's happening is that publishers are concerned with getting the book out in the right period to maximize sales."
Complaints about editing come from a range of writers -- from a best-selling author who is reluctant to talk publicly about her hired freelance copy editor to a first-time biographer like Bob Thomas, who spotted 14 errors in the final production stage of his manuscript, some of which made it into his book about the golfer Ben Hogan.
Mr. Thomas said his book, "Ben Hogan's 'Secret': A Fictionalized Biography," had been shifted among at least four editors at Macmillan before its publication in 1997. "We still left typos in there," he said. "In the author's note, there's a word called 'skill," and it should have been 'shill.' "
John Michael, a former executive editor at Macmillan, did some of the editing and then departed to take a new post before the book was published. He is frank with his authors about what they can often expect in the current publishing climate.
"I tell authors that there will always be 1 or 2 percent of errors that get in," said Mr. Michael, who added that editing had deteriorated over the years, but so gradually that "it's like dirt on your glasses: it starts out a little bit at a time and all of a sudden you take them off and think, 'How could I see?' "
Critics are also taking note of sloppiness. A reviewer at Time magazine, for instance, helpfully provided the page numbers for errors in a May critique of "The Unfinished Presidency," Douglas Brinkley's biography of Jimmy Carter, published by Viking. For example, the book refers to a Pakistani billionaire who suddenly becomes a Palestinian billionaire.
"Books are not perfect; authors are not perfect; editors are not perfect," said the editor of the biography, Wendy Wolf, who added that as more books were published, more manuscripts were submitted that were not in perfect shape. "We have neither infinite time nor infinite budgets, and everybody does their best."
Readers are also weighing in with withering criticism of flaws that could have been corrected with editing. Some posted reviews of Toni Morrison's latest novel, "Paradise," on the Amazon.com Web site complaining about tangled plot lines, undeveloped characters and confusing passages.
Ms. Morrison was unavailable for comment, her assistant said. But in a January interview in U.S. News and World Report, she responded to general criticism about "Paradise" by expressing the desire for more time to "step back" during the period between submitting the manuscript and final publication.
Her publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, speeded up the publication of "Paradise" from the spring to last January to take advantage of heavier holiday bookstore traffic. Her editor, Erroll McDonald, said that Ms. Morrison's book was one of the special cases involving speed, but that in his experience most titles were turned around in the old standard of nine months. The author, Mr. McDonald said, could have made the same comment about more time even "if she had nine more months."
Agents and writers say that editors in contemporary publishing used to have more time to send detailed letters explaining how to fix or improve a manuscript. But often they are now too preoccupied to take this intermediate step, and decisions are simply made to buy, reject or cancel a manuscript.
"I have an author who's struggling with the writing, but the editor would look at drafts and would provide comments that were far too general," said a literary agent who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Instead, he said, he ended up charging his author an extra fee to help with reorganizing and rewriting.

Seeing a Need Ro 'Hit the Target'
Last April, Michael V. Carlisle left his job of 18 years at the William Morris Agency to open a literary agency for authors. One feature of his agency is a newly hired in-house editor, Neal Bascomb, who will work closely with fiction writers.
"Fiction manuscripts have to hit the target absolutely squarely," Mr. Carlisle said. "Editors are under such pressure. They are looking to acquire books for a list, to make money, move forward, to keep their jobs. But by and large, if consolidation points to anything, it's not to old-fashioned red-pencil editing. It's to economies of scale and efficiency of product."
With some authors pining for more intensive editing, several loose groups of independent editors have formed in New York, and consultants have also established bases far from the publishing hub in places like Santa Fe, N.M., and the Berkshires of Massachusetts.
Barry Werth, a nonfiction writer, hired a personal editor to work on his latest book about a medical malpractice case, "Damages," after receiving what he characterized as minimal editing on his first book, "The Billion-Dollar Molecule." He recruited Chris Jerome, a former magazine editor who runs a freelance editing service from her home in Ashfield, Mass., and frequently proofreads manuscripts for Knopf authors like Ms. Morrison.
"I sent the manuscript, and she sent it back with detailed notes in a 10-page memo," Mr. Werth said. "What my New York editors do is buy books and move them through the process."

HEADLINE: Media Convergence

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Billions of dollars and a bold high-technology vision are fueling the AT&T Corporation's plan to buy Tele-Communications Inc. The merger, announced last week, is the latest in a rising wave of corporate deals sweeping up telecommunications, cable television and media companies as these industries become increasingly dependent on the digital technology of computing.
The business logic behind the trend is that companies now face a once-in-a-corporate-lifetime choice of getting in early to become leaders in the new markets of the information age or being relegated to also-ran status. Earlier this month, two major media companies -- the Walt Disney Company and the NBC unit of the General Electric Company -- applied that logic in making significant investments in popular sites on the Internet's World Wide Web. 
 Whether any of these deals make sense, or make money anytime soon, will depend largely on the economic behavior of people like Charles Vandagriff of Oakland, Calif.
Mr. Vandagriff, his wife and two daughters are the kind of well-off, technologically fluent family earmarked first by phone, media and computer companies in their consumer marketing campaigns.
Someday, AT&T wants families like Mr. Vandagriff's to turn to the company for one-stop shopping for not only all of their telephone and cable television services but new information services as well. And AT&T's purchase of TCI, the nation's second-largest cable television company, is seen as a big step toward realizing AT&T's vision of becoming an all-in-one digital delivery system.
The 49-year-old Mr. Vandagriff is a furniture designer, and his wife, Kathy Sinsheimer, is a psychotherapist. Their household has three personal computers, four phone lines, a cellular phone and two pagers.
There are 16 million such wired families in America, typically with incomes of $70,000 or more, at least one PC and often more than one telephone line, according to the Yankee Group, a research firm. "No new technology or technology marketing plan will succeed if it doesn't succeed first with families like that one," observed Howard Anderson, the Yankee Group's managing director.
By acquiring TCI's cable-television system, AT&T gets a higher-speed network for sending telephone, video and Internet services directly into consumers' homes, including 1.3 million TCI customers in the San Francisco area like the Vandagriffs. It was this vision of a phone-entertainment-Internet supercarrier that C. Michael Armstrong, AT&T's chairman, and John C. Malone, the chairman of TCI, were extolling last Wednesday when they announced their $31.8 billion deal.
Mr. Vandagriff remains skeptical. "I'm sure these companies are trying to think ahead, but it's not clear to me what they are going to try to sell us really," he said. "I have so many services now -- Internet, cable, phone, cellular and pagers -- that I can't imagine I want any more. I'll wait for the future to arrive."
Telecommunications and media companies do not believe they have the luxury of waiting. The rapid advances of technology, they say, are forcing them to act now. The main engine is the spread of digital technology that enables text, sound and video all to be expressed and distributed in the form of the elemental building blocks of computing, the electronic 1's and 0's called bits (short for binary digits).
Though all forms of information can be reduced to bits, text requires the fewest bits, while sound and video consume many more. One letter in a word can be rendered in eight bits, while a few seconds of movie-style video may require millions of bits. Most of the new services companies hope to market eventually -- from video phones to movies on demand -- are expected to be multimedia offerings that require high-speed connections into homes.
So today, companies are puzzling over both how to carry more bits into homes and how to package those bits into new entertainment, information or shopping services that people may actually want. In simple terms, telecommunications companies can be thought of as the pipes and media companies as the programmers.
It will be costly and time-consuming to upgrade the existing bit-delivery mechanisms. Phone lines are skinny pipes, but they are two-way networks that can both send and receive data; cable systems offer fat pipes, but must be converted from one-way to two-way systems. It will, for example, take AT&T nearly five years and $9 billion to upgrade the entire TCI network, the Yankee Group estimates.
As with most new technologies, from the telephone to the personal computer, companies will be able to pay for high-speed Internet service first, before costs come down to make it common in homes.
The impact, many experts predict, will be sweeping. Nicholas Negroponte, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Laboratory, insists that for all the attention the Internet has received, the power of the technology is still not understood. "The Internet is wildly underestimated," Mr. Negroponte said. "It will grow to be the enabling technology of all media -- TV, radio, magazines and so on."
A longtime Internet enthusiast, Mr. Negroponte advises many of the nation's leading media and telecommunications companies. What gives his counsel added weight, though, are the recent trends in household computer and Internet use.
By January 1998, the share of American households with personal computers had reached 42 percent, up from 31 percent in 1995, according to Odyssey L.P., a research firm in San Francisco. Over the same three-year span, the percentage of households on line has increased to 23 percent from 7 percent.
"A few years ago, the Internet was a geek network," noted Kate Delhagen, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., a technology research firm. "Now, the Internet equals consumer network, something that is increasingly part of day-to-day life."
As more people go on line, the Internet attracts more advertisers, increasing the potential for electronic commerce. For example, on-line purchases of airline tickets, hotel rooms and other travel services tripled last year to $654 million, Forrester estimates. By 2001, it projects on-line travel sales will reach $7.4 billion, as the number of on-line shoppers increases fourfold to 43 million people.
With new-media startups beginning to attract large audiences to their sites on the Internet's World Wide Web, the established media companies are taking notice, starting to move beyond experiments to make sizable investments. Two weeks ago, for example, Disney announced that it would buy 43 percent of the Infoseek Corporation, an on-line directory service, in a deal worth about $900 million.
The most popular properties on line, from the Yahoo directory service to America Online Inc., are likely takeover candidates, industry executives say. Indeed, AT&T did talk to America Online recently, though the overture was rebuffed. The Internet media business is expected to follow the pattern of cable television, where entrepreneurs created CNN, ESPN and MTV and were later bought out by Time Warner Inc., Disney and Viacom Inc., respectively.
"It's inevitable that you will see increased concentration in the new-media field as it matures, just as you did in every other media business in history," said Mike Slade, chief executive of the Starwave Corporation, the Web developer that built Disney's ESPN and ABC News sites.
Someday, people will look back on the recent telecommunications and media deals as either shrewd or premature depending on how quickly the anticipated new business develops. History, both recent and more distant, suggests some caution is in order.
In December 1992, Mr. Malone of TCI declared that as early as 1994 his company would install digital compression technology enabling customers to receive as many as 500 channels on their televisions and many of the interactive shopping and information services that people are today saying will be delivered via a supercharged Internet.
Back then, television was declared the engine of the so-called information highway. "Television will never be the same," Mr. Malone said. "Our ability to deliver program services is limited only by our imagination."
Following a slightly different avenue of technology, Mr. Malone may be proved correct, though his timetable was overly optimistic. Over the years, the technologies that have truly transformed the way people live required some time to spread.
For example, it took 70 years from the first consumer sale of a telephone in 1876 to the year when half of the nation's households had phones, in 1946, according to a study by Technologic Partners, a research firm in New York. It took the automobile 29 years, from 1895 to 1924, to reach half of American families, while it took the television only 8 years, from 1946 to 1954.
"Unless you keep some technology history in mind, you are setting yourself up for disillusionment," said Richard Shaffer, a principal of Technologic Partners.
Mr. Shaffer's own guess is that it will be 5 to 10 years before most Americans will find that communications or media offerings have changed markedly.
In the meantime, analysts expect that combinations like AT&T-TCI will focus on consolidated marketing of existing services. Such telecommunications supercarriers want to offer local and long-distance phone and cellular service, cable TV and Internet access -- all on one bill with a price discount for buying all these services from one company.
Now that is an innovation that intrigues Mr. Vandagriff in Oakland. "If they could simplify all this, put it on one understandable monthly bill and then offer me a discount of 20 percent or so, I'd say, 'O.K., you've got my attention,' " he said.

With tuxedo and bow tie, he came onstage for a rare New York performance at the Supper Club on Thursday night as part of the JVC Jazz Festival and seemed snug in his own geometry of ritual: he kissed his watch, brushed his gray mustache, touched his ear. He repeated these actions during the performance, and never talked between songs except to introduce one of his band members.
Widely known in Europe and lionized in Italy, Mr. Conte is a former lawyer, now in his early 60's, who has just been introduced to the United States with the recent album "The Best of Paolo Conte" (Nonesuch/ WEA). He plays a kind of unified-Europe cabaret music -- a mixture of Weimar, tango, habanera rhythms and French chansonnier style -- that is, oddly, a stone's throw from a recent American singer-songwriter tradition. 
 Randy Newman has approached this boozy, poetic zone, as have Tom Waits, Van Dyke Parks and others. But Mr. Conte's version is more jazz-specific, referring to the Ellington jungle-band style of the late 20's. And where American practitioners grow fuzzily content, idealizing a lost innocent America when doing this middle-aged songster routine, Mr. Conte presents songs filled with tetchy observations, mild xenophobia and actual poetry. It's perfect film music (Mr. Conte has composed for Lina Wertmuller movies) but easy to understand on a soigne concert stage.
His economically constructed songs were played with an octet, including bandoneon, guitar, bass, drums and a three-man horn section. Mr. Conte sang in Italian, with a narrow, crumbly growl, occasionally performing a jazz scat solo through a kazoo, and played dry piano solos with two fingers (he used to be a vibraphonist). He has beautiful ideas: one was about the secret relationship between artist and song, imagining an internal speech given by an Argentine musician to the form of the music itself: "You'll have me, green milonga, because you were written for me, for my sensitivity, my polished shoes, my timing, for my taste, for all my tiredness and my ham acting."
In Mr. Conte's world, the minutes pass slowly, with long gaps for self-analysis, and events outside of one's immediate environment may well be a waste of time. One song on the Nonesuch album, which he didn't perform, theorizes queasily about making the journey to Genoa, though it is only 50 miles from his hometown of Asti: people are different there, and he's not quite sure why one should feel compelled to visit. And in one song he did perform, "Chi Siamo Noi," he sang of Vasco da Gama and other travelers, repeatedly asking, "Who are we, and where are we going?"

HEADLINE: Scientist at Work: Steven Chu;
Master of Molecule Manipulation Works on the Wild Side

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ; James Glanz writes for Science magazine.

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif.

 BODY:
AN atom can be here, there and somewhere else all at once; it can be going both this way and that way; it can be rattling with internal energy and quiet. Such are the quirky freedoms of the quantum microworld that do not apply to automobiles, apples or people. But if there is an exception to this rule, it would be the mind of Dr. Steven Chu, the master of manipulating atoms and molecules who shared the most recent Nobel Prize in Physics with two other researchers.
Dr. Chu, a professor at Stanford University, ranges so widely among topics of interest to him that any attempt to keep up leaves a blurry succession of visual images, like a slide show inadequately describing one's dream vacation. 
 Here he is clutching a Reuben sandwich while filling a steno pad with sketches of an experiment to stretch DNA molecules like knotted rubber bands. Here, he is in the back of a cab where he is alternately shouting instructions to the driver and quietly rationalizing his mega-celebrity status in Taiwan. This one shows him explaining the cosmological theory of multiple universes to the Dalai Lama. And finally, here, in his lab, Dr. Chu is pointing through the window of a vacuum chamber to a hovering blob of atoms that are trapped and supercooled by the forces of laser light -- the achievement for which he won the 1997 Nobel Prize.
On a recent day in his Stanford office, the 50-year-old, aggressively trim Dr. Chu, wearing khaki trousers, a pullover shirt and scruffy tennis shoes, sat on a puffy couch and held court for his students and research associates. He bounced between taking phone calls and bantering about projects that combine conceptual simplicity with a faint air of unbelievability. In one experiment, the drop of a "fountain" of atoms is clocked to measure gravity so precisely that the technique could be used like a petroleum dowser to find hidden pockets of oil. In others, a single DNA molecule marked with fluorescent dyes is dragged about as a video camera mounted on a microscope captures the reptilian motions.
"I'm drawn towards the wilder, science-fiction-type stuff," said Dr. Chu, who grew up in Garden City, Long Island. "It's much more fun for me to learn completely new things than it is to sort of ice the cake," he said. "Well, that's part of the reason one is a scientist. It's not to just crawl into a little corner of some field and go to all of the meetings that all 50 of you in the world go to. 'Oh, this person twiddled that and look what happened.' After a while it becomes a little rococo, if you know what I mean."
That adventurousness is reflected in Dr. Chu's recent moves from his original field of atomic physics into polymer science, chemistry and biology. But unlike the average scientific dilettante, Dr. Chu sees to it that this crosscutting work always bears the mark of his experimental dazzle and intuition for pay dirt. "What Steve brings to science is an incredible technical virtuosity -- a sort of technical showmanship," said David Pritchard, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. "There is this terrific scientific taste," added Daniel Kleppner, also of M.I.T. "He has the vision to see new areas emerging. He's a damn good experimenter, but he's also highly creative."
Those who work most closely with Dr. Chu say he also has the incalculably useful ability to see the complex interactions of the microworld directly, rather than relying on the equations that thicken the chapters of physics textbooks.
"He doesn't have to resort to those formulas," said Cheng Chin, one of Dr. Chu's doctoral students. "He has atoms in his mind."
Steven Chu emerged from a cauldron of academic overachievement. His father, who emigrated from mainland China to study chemical engineering at M.I.T., retired as a professor at Brooklyn Polytechnic University and is a member of the Academica Sinica, Taiwan's most distinguished scholarly society. His mother studied economics at M.I.T. and a prestigious university in China. Two brothers and four cousins eventually generated three M.D.'s, four Ph.D.'s and a law degree. And that doesn't count the aunts and uncles.
"I was to become the academic black sheep," Dr. Chu wrote in a biographical sketch for the Nobel Foundation. There is still an edge to his voice when he recalls that for years in his father's eyes, he never lived up to the dizzying scholarly achievements of his older brother, Gilbert Chu, an associate professor at Stanford School of Medicine.
With what he described as a "relatively lackluster" record at Garden City High, Dr. Chu was not accepted into Ivy League colleges. Instead, he attended the University of Rochester, where his intellectual appetite exploded, leading to undergraduate degrees in physics and math and a doctorate in physics at the University of California at Berkeley.
An encounter with the late Richard Feynman's "Lectures in Physics," a comprehensive and idiosyncratic introduction to basic physics, ignited an interest in theoretical physics. Not until later, well into graduate school, did he start fiddling with equipment in physics laboratories at night. It was like Nat King Cole finding his voice: So long, jazz piano. "I said, 'Well, it's ridiculous, sneaking in and making play experiments, and I'm ignoring my theoretical problem,' " Dr. Chu explained. Experiments became the day job.
He quickly began a long-term relationship with the powerful light source called the laser. His method was to juice up the inadequate equipment he could buy off the shelf, which let him stay ahead of the beat scientifically. That improvisational approach served him well when he moved to the old AT&T Bell Laboratories, the famed center of technical and scientific innovation in New Jersey.
"He would come into my office with these great ideas, all excited, and scribble stuff up on my board," said Dr. Douglas Osheroff, who shared the previous Nobel Prize in Physics and is now a professor at Stanford. (The university has raked in five physics Nobels in the past 10 years.)
As to the cross-disciplinary flair Dr. Chu would develop, Dr. Osheroff said, "that was a very standard approach at Bell Laboratories and almost part of the culture there."
It was at Bell Labs that Dr. Chu met Arthur Ashkin, who was trapping microscopic particles with laser light and who dreamed of trapping atoms. Dr. Ashkin and his colleagues were the first to demonstrate that particles would "stick" to the laser beam for nearly the same reasons that dust sticks to a glass rod that has been charged positively by rubbing it with cat's fur. Even though a dust mote has no net charge, its negative charges -- electrons -- crowd over to the side closest to the rod, being pulled toward it like vacationers waving at the rails of a docking ship. That leaves a positive excess on the opposite side of the mote, but because the negative charges are closer to the rod, their attraction wins out and the mote sticks. In the Bell Labs apparatus, the dancing electric fields of laser light take the place of those static electrical charges, attracting a particle to the most intense parts of a laser beam. Instruments that move particles around with lasers have come to be called "laser tweezers."
After adding this technique to his repertoire, Dr. Chu expanded on it by "gluing" tiny polystyrene beads, which he could grab and move with laser tweezers, onto strands of fluorescent DNA. By stretching the DNA and dragging it through a soup of other DNA molecules, he and colleagues at Stanford later helped confirm theories developed by Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, the Nobel Prize winner at the Ecole Superieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles in Paris. Dr. de Gennes had predicted that any such long molecules, called polymers, should "reptate," or change directions like a snake, whose entire body follows the same path without cutting corners.
"We've had theories of that kind of thing for years," said Bruno Zimm, a chemistry professor at the University of California, San Diego. "Actually seeing it is something else."
Among other things, reptation helps explain the toy-store mystery of why Silly Putty bounces and squishes. If a child hurls it against a wall, the impact comes faster than the polymers in the putty can move along their tortuous paths, so the putty acts like a solid and bounces. But a slow squish gives the polymers time to slither around. Academics call such materials "viscoelastic."
Still more recently, using a different method for manipulating the polymers, Dr. Chu and his colleagues, Thomas Perkins and Douglas Smith, took virus DNA that was in a naturally coiled state and stretched it. They found that identical polymers beginning from the same state can uncoil in different ways, getting hung up in strange knots and bends -- behavior Dr. de Gennes called "molecular individualism."
This effect could be important in everything from the extrusion of plastics to the flow of oil in pipelines, where squirming, free-floating polymers reduce the drag when they are added to the oil -- improving the flow for reasons that are still poorly understood. And, noting that with every unraveling of the virus DNA polymers they used "you have the same virus and the same genes and very, very different outcomes," he said with a laugh, "So maybe you can take that as a moral in life -- that it's neither nature nor nurture."
"Polymer physicists were goo-goo, ga-ga over it," Dr. Chu said of the DNA work.
But the loudest applause came when Dr. Chu used laser light to chill atoms, so that they -- like the beads -- could be trapped. At room temperature this would be a hopeless task, because atoms are moving at thousands of miles per hour.
In 1985, Dr. Chu and his colleagues at Bell Labs cooled a cloud of atoms to 240 millionths of a degree above absolute zero with what he called "optical molasses." They did it by bathing the atoms in laser beams fired together from all directions, which created a kind of drag that slowed the atoms to inches per second, corresponding to the low temperature. That achievement finally allowed atoms to be laser-trapped.
"When I first heard about it, I said, 'That's incredible,' " recalled Dr. Kleppner of M.I.T. "And the next thing was, 'But of course; why not do that?' " The molasses analogy was a brilliant way of seeing through the immense technical challenges posed by the optical cooler, he said.
Dr. Chu shared the Nobel Prize with William Phillips of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris. All three have made enormous contributions to the science of atom cooling and trapping. The traps have become standard equipment for creating the ultraprecise timepieces called atomic clocks. The techniques are also often a starting point for outlandish physics experiments, such as when scientists at the University of Colorado, Boulder, created a new state of ultracold matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate two years ago.
Like a juggler whose hands become ever more difficult to follow over the years, Dr. Chu has continued playing tricks with trapped atoms. In one experiment, for example, he and Mark Kasevich of Yale University used laser pulses to put atoms into "split personality" states predicted by quantum theory. Both states feel the tug of gravity as they move on slightly different trajectories. The degree to which those states are compatible when the split atoms recombine gives a measure of gravity's strength to about a part in a billion. That is fine enough to detect underground geological features, like oil pockets.
Dr. Chu has also continued the push into biology, partly in collaboration with Jim Spudich, chairman of the biochemistry department at Stanford. This aspect of Dr. Chu's work has become so well known that he was almost lured away by another university's fetching offer to co-direct a new cross-disciplinary institute. "I was tempted," he said.
He turned down the offer because of the difficult decisions the move would have entailed for his two sons, ages 13 and 16. Dr. Chu is divorced and shares in their care.
"Fundamentally, I'm happy here," he said in his office. "I'm very much against people trying to leverage themselves and their institutions. I don't want to see academics go into a state of free agency."
As high as his star has risen in the United States, it is nothing compared to his profile in Taiwan. His friend Yuan Lee -- yet another Nobel Prize-winning physicist -- now heads the Academica Sinica, of which Dr. Chu is a member. The combination of Dr. Chu's ties to Taiwan, his particular brand of charisma and a society that still lionizes scholars has led to hordes of cameras and reporters' shadowing him in public.
"One time he came back and said: 'Taiwan is crazy for me,' " Mr. Chin recalled. A Taiwanese professor joked that Dr. Chu's popularity was second only to Leonardo diCaprio's for a time. "DiCaprio is first by a whole lot," insisted Dr. Chu, who said that he speaks only basic Chinese with a heavy American accent.
Even the Dalai Lama found an opportunity to talk physics with him a few years ago. "He was obsessed with finding out what physics could say about time," Dr. Chu said. "I'm surmising why," he explained. "If you're a Buddhist, you believe in reincarnation, and there's this conservation-of-souls problem," referring to the question of where new souls come from as the number of living beings in the world keeps expanding.
In his moments with the Dalai Lama, the exiled leader of Tibet, who wore his maroon and saffron robes for the public conversation, Dr. Chu outlined the speculative theory that the universe is just one of many that are appearing and disappearing like bubbles in a champagne glass. (The theory is notably championed by another Stanford physicist, Andrei Linde.) That way, as vast amounts of time passed and whole universes became inhospitable to life, souls might flit from one universe to another and keep the total number constant, Dr. Chu suggested.
The Dalai Lama's reaction?
"He just listened," said Dr. Chu. "Juuuuust listened."

HEADLINE: Young Dancers Pounce Into Battle;
Sports Meets Art at an International Competition in Mississippi

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss., June 27

 BODY:
It is a marvelous anomaly that many of the world's finest young ballet dancers spent the last two weeks performing in this otherwise somnolent capital city of some 200,000 people. Jackson, after all, can lay claim to some cultural sophistication as the home of Eudora Welty, but it is still small and rural enough that the lead newspaper article one recent day was about vandalism at a hog farm.
"There's some irony in a relatively obscure Southern town hosting this event," the Mayor, Harvey Johnson, acknowledged in an interview. And virtually everyone in town agreed it felt sort of odd to have the dancers here, though they have been to Jackson before. 
 The event was the sixth U.S.A. International Ballet Competition, which ended this weekend. Every four years or so since 1979, it has brought ballet coaches, company directors and choreographers from five continents here to view dancers they might not have a chance to see anywhere else.
Indeed, at a time when international competitions are proliferating around the world -- there are now about 15 of them, including the triennial one in New York, the sixth of which will occur in June 2000 -- Jackson's, astonishingly enough, may well be the best-attended, most fiercely contested of them all.
"This is now the world's premier competition," said Bruce Marks, artistic director emeritus of the Boston Ballet, implying that in ballet these days, even the competitions compete. Mr. Marks has a bias; he has served as chairman of the jury for the last three competitions in Jackson. But he isn't necessarily wrong. Past grand prix winners in Jackson have included Jose Manuel Carreno, the Cuban dancer who is now a principal at American Ballet Theater, and Andris Liepa, the former Bolshoi and Kirov star.
In any case, for many ballet companies, it is their best opportunity to fill openings. And for many dancers, in this country and overseas, it is their best opportunity to be seen, to assess their standing in the world of dance, perhaps to earn a little prize money and, most important, to find a job.
This year, 87 dancers from 26 countries (including New Zealand, Australia, Mongolia, Cuba and South Korea, as well as Eastern and Western Europe and South America), all selected from applications and videotapes, joined the competition. There were three rounds, with dancers eliminated after the first two. By round three, 37 dancers remained.
"It was important to me to get to the third round, so I would get to perform all the solos I prepared," said Lenaig Guegan, 22, a French dancer who is a member of the Royal Danish Ballet in Copenhagen, and was hoping, with her boyfriend and fellow dancer, Bernard Courtot de Bouteiller, 24, to attract the attention of other artistic directors. "We're a bit bored where we are," she said. He added, "If we could get a contract somewhere, that would be great."
It was a provocative thing, throughout the week, to hear the dancers routinely referred to as "competitors," to see the women's senior gold-medal winner, a 24-year-old Russian dancer, Anna Antonicheva, burst into tears like a beauty pageant winner at the announcement of her triumph, and to see Ms. Guegan so obviously despondent after winning a merit award but not one of the main prizes. She and Mr. Courtot were among many at the event who decried the idea of applying the numerical standards of sport to an art form, though everyone conceded that the audition was no less competitive in its way and that all performers needed a competitive spirit to match their expectations of themselves.
 
Competing, But With Whom?
"I don't believe that in dance you should compete for a title," said Elisabeth Carroll, a coach and former dancer with American Ballet Theater and the Joffrey and and Harkness Ballets. "You compete with the audience, and in that sense you have to win every night. The difference is you make your competitors happy. Here you want to make them sad."
Competitive events discourage the expression and feeling that are the main business of art, the argument goes, and encourage dancers to be sensational and superficial, to rely on the gravity-defying athletic leaps and diverse turns on toe that draw gasps from an audience -- "the flash and bash," in the words of the prominent dance coach David Howard -- but have little to do with the evocative grace of the art; jumping, after all, is not dancing.
"I've often wondered if we lived in outer space, would we be trying so hard to get to earth," Mr. Howard said. For the audience, too, a competition is an odd experience.
What was presented in Jackson was not a finished ballet performance, with its arcs of narrative and music and variety of choreographed passages. Rather, the evenings consisted of individual dancer after individual dancer (with the occasional pair thrown in), each offering a few minutes from the 19th-century classical repertory (solos from works like "Esmeralda," "Don Quixote" and "Paquita," and pas de deux from "Sleeping Beauty" and "Le Corsaire") and later, something contemporary.
They were bite-size ballet nuggets filled with leaps and turns, the dance equivalent of a football highlight film or an Olympic gymnastics event. And when Renata Pavam Maia, a 16-year-old from Brazil who would win a silver medal, danced the final round with a bandaged ankle, wincing through her performance and weeping as she took her bows, it seemed an echo of Kerri Strug.
At the same time, everyone acknowledges that the competitions are effective professional tools, clearinghouses where dancers' talents can be displayed, discussed and bartered. And for all their ambivalence, dancers do want to win, because with winning comes the imprimatur of supremacy.
All this puts an unusual burden on the judges, who must try to see beyond the flash and bash of each dancer in order to assess his or her artfulness. The 13 judges, all from different countries, awarded no grand prix this year.
"All that means is that we didn't think anyone was ready to leap onto the stage at the Metropolitan Opera at just this moment," Mr. Marks said. "We definitely saw the potential for that, though."
They did award some $60,000 in prizes and scholarships to 21 dancers, including Ms. Guegan (a merit award in the name of Robert Joffrey, the jury chairman of the first competition), Mr. Courtot (who won a silver medal) and Rasta Thomas, from Washington, who won the top prize in the senior men's division, though he is only 16. (The junior division was ostensibly for dancers 15 through 18; the senior, 19 through 26.)
Mr. Thomas, a principal with the Hartford Ballet, doesn't even want to be a dancer. A student of martial arts with aspirations to attend the Yale School of Drama, he exhibits a supernaturally flawless charm ("The pleasure is all mine" he is wont to say after a handshake), and he intends to be the next Hollywood action hero. "I want to inspire, I want to be a legend, I want to be President of the United States, I want to be so much," he said.
 
Begun With Energy And Fund-Raising
Major international competitions date back to 1964, when the first one was held in Varna, Bulgaria, and eventually expanded into a series of contests that rotated annually among Varna, Moscow and Tokyo. (When Tokyo withdrew in the early 1980's, it was replaced by Helsinki, Finland.)
It was in the mid-1970's that a well-known New York ballet teacher named Thalia Mara, who just turned 87, moved to Jackson to run the local ballet company. It was her fund-raising and energy, along with that of Joffrey and the dance critic Walter Terry, that brought the American version of the event here. The event pumps some $6 million into the city's economy, and it has remained here because Jacksonians volunteer by the hundreds, house dancers in their homes and generally treat the visitors with a hospitality that is downright, well, Southern.
Unlike the practice in other competitions, for instance, dancers eliminated in the early rounds are invited to stay, at no cost, to participate in classes and workshops, to attend all performances and to dance in a choreographed group performance at the closing gala.
"Everyone is so nice here," the foreign dancers said last week, again and again, often with noticeable incredulity. And some of them even liked the early-summer heat, which had stunned the city torpid. "It keeps my muscles warm, so that's good," said Anna Ivanova, who is the principal dancer at the Russian Ballet Theater of Delaware, in Wilmington. She was born in Siberia.
For admittedly sports-minded Jacksonians, the event was clearly an opportunity to mix the culture of the concert hall with the culture of the stadium. (White Jacksonians, anyway. In a city that is half black, the homogeneity of the crowd was striking.)
Night after night, they filled the 2,400-seat Thalia Mara Hall downtown, whooping for their favorites in mid-dance and launching "bravos" and "bravas" from the mezzanine. They even seemed to like the contemporary offerings of the dancers, though most of the professional dance observers found them, with a few exceptions (like Mr. Courtot's performance of his own choreography of "The Rite of Spring") poorly chosen at best, ponderous and pretentious at worst.
"We have a serious taste problem with the contemporary stuff," said Mr. Marks, adding that next time he might well have all the dancers prepare a piece selected in advance by the jury. For all the complaints, in the end, almost everyone found the event gratifying, with Ms. Ivanova giving a particularly measured assessment of her experience.
"The first round was kind of scary, but now I like it," she said after her final performance in round three. "It's different from dancing with a company. This is a little harder. You don't get a second chance to try again another night, with a different preparation. And you have more responsibility, because with a company you have their support. It's difficult for everyone to compete, but if you don't want to compete, you don't come."
She paused. This was before the results were announced, before learning she had not won a prize. "Of course, it matters if I win, but it's more important that I performed well, that I did my best," she said, realizing that at 25, she may have come too late to the joys of competing. "This is my first competition, and I'd like to come back. But now I'm too old."

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Rise to a Record

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29

 BODY:
Sales of new homes rose in May to a record level, fueled by low interest rates and high consumer optimism.
New single-family home sales rose three-tenths of a percent in May, to an annual rate of 890,000 units, the Commerce Department said today, breaking the previous record set in April. Analysts had expected a drop in May sales to an annual rate of 877,000 units. 
 "It's so good that it's scary," said Robert Toll, chairman and chief executive at the luxury home builder Toll Brothers Inc. in Huntingdon Valley, Pa. "We're enjoying a fabulous market and I would expect it's going to continue as long as the economy is supportive." The housing strength has been defined by the longest stretch ever of new-home sales exceeding an 800,000-unit annual pace. May marked the ninth consecutive month the pace of sales was above that level. Sales of new one-family homes in the first quarter averaged 855,000 a month at an annual rate, a record and up 3.3 percent from the 828,000 average a month in the fourth quarter. New-home sales rose 15.7 percent in the West, to a 265,000 rate, in the Northeast new-home sales rose 3.3 percent, to a 94,000 rate, the highest since a similar pace in March 1997. In the South, they fell 6.7 percent, to a 390,000-unit annual rate, and in the Midwest they fell 4.1 percent, to a 142,000 rate.

HEADLINE: Rubin Defends I.M.F. Policies and Continues His Asian Tour

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, June 29

 BODY:
After a whirlwind visit to Malaysia, in which he defended the International Monetary Fund's harsh prescriptions for healing Asia's economies, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin arrived this evening in the place where the financial contagion began.
Mr. Rubin is to meet on Tuesday with Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai of Thailand and other officials to discuss their efforts to climb out of a recession, nearly one year to the day since Bangkok floated its currency, prompting a devastating devaluation from which it has yet to recover. 
 Mr. Rubin is touring Asia as the I.M.F. is under growing attack from politicians and business people here. They who say the fund's formula of high interest rates, rigorous fiscal policy and stable currencies is strangling the region's economies and worsening the pain of the crisis.
Today Mr. Rubin offered a measured endorsement of the policy. "I think, on balance, the I.M.F. has had it about right," he said at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur after meeting Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia. "I think if you loosen interest rates it runs the risk of eroding the currency."
Mr. Rubin said he had a "very good discussion" with Dr. Mahathir, although he would not divulge details. Dr. Mahathir has been a vituperative critic of the West, faulting currency traders and accusing the United States Government of trying to profit from the economic misery.
It was not clear that Mr. Rubin and Dr. Mahathir had a meeting of the minds. On the question of whether the United States should intervene in the market to support Malaysia's currency -- a measure that Dr. Mahathir has called for but that the United States has rebuffed -- Mr. Rubin said: "The views of the Prime Minister are well known. And I think our views are well known."
Still, Mr. Rubin's aides said that the tone of the meeting was constructive and that Dr. Mahathir did not make inflammatory remarks, which he has been known to do in the past.
Earlier today, Mr. Rubin met Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who made waves by disagreeing with Dr. Mahathir about whether Malaysia should lower its interest rates to jump-start its economy. Dr. Mahathir said the rates should be lowered. Mr. Anwar favored keeping them high enough to maintain the stability of the currency, the ringgit.
Speaking at a meeting today with Mr. Rubin, Mr. Anwar sounded more like his boss, declaring that interest rates were "prohibitively high" and that the financial crisis was putting a severe strain on Malaysian society.
The pain of the Asian crisis has reached even a prosperous neighbor, Singapore, which today announced a $1.2 billion package of measures to stimulate its sluggish economy. Acknowledging that its economy will grow far more slowly this year than it had forecasted, the Singaporean Government said it would increase public spending and offer tax rebates to businesses.
The social and political cost of the Asian crisis has been a recurring theme of Mr. Rubin's tour, which began on Friday in China and ends on Wednesday in South Korea. In a meeting with American executives in Kuala Kumpur, several people warned Mr. Rubin about Indonesia, which they said could easily slide into disarray in the wake of President Suharto's resignation.
"I think there is a discomfort in Indonesia that the U.S. and the West aren't taking Indonesia seriously," said Peter L. Woicke, managing director and chief executive of the Asia Pacific division of J. P. Morgan.
Although the economic crisis precipitated a change in governments here, Thailand has so far avoided the kind of social unrest that hit Indonesia or the political dissension that has afflicted Malaysia. Indeed, the United States has praised the Chuan Government for faithfully carrying out the I.M.F. plan, which it says has helped Thailand regain foreign investors' confidence.
By most yardsticks, though, the economy is in parlous shape. Exports are falling, unemployment is soaring, and economists say the country's output could shrink 5.5 percent this year. After a binge of borrowing from foreign banks in the boom, Thailand's bad debts may total up to $25 billion, equal to 20 percent of its gross domestic product.
Even Bangkok's notorious traffic jams have subsided, a barometer, residents say of how much commercial life has slowed.
Executives say the public's patience with I.M.F.-style solutions is wearing thin.
"The economy is deteriorating, with no end in sight," said James Stent, senior executive vice president of the Bank of Asia, Thailand's 11th largest bank. "It's time for emergency measures."
David Lipton, the Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, said the I.M.F. had made sensible adjustments to take account of the worsening economy, allowing it, for example, to run a budget deficit instead of a surplus. Mr. Lipton said Mr. Rubin would urge the Government to continue reforming its banks, to strengthen its bankruptcy laws and to allow additional foreign investment.
But Mr. Stent said that as the crisis has dragged on, some people here are coming to believe that Thailand's political and financial institutions are not strong enough to tolerate the pressures of being fully open. "There's increasing skepticism," he said, "that opening up to foreign investment is a panacea."

HEADLINE: Fed Expected to Hold Back On a Rate Increase for Now

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29

 BODY:
The most militant inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve will have plenty to fret about when the central bank meets Tuesday and Wednesday to consider whether to raise interest rates.
The economy grew at a sizzling 5.4 percent annual pace in the first quarter. The unemployment rate, at 4.3 percent, is the lowest since 1970. Consumer price inflation, while still low, is increasing, and the Clinton Administration's decision to help prop up the Japanese yen could ameliorate the inflation-fighting effects of the strong dollar, which has helped keep import prices down. 
 The strength in the stock market has left consumers feeling flush and confident. Just today the Commerce Department reported new-home sales in May hit a record.
Taken together, such signals of strong growth and rising inflation pressures might normally be enough to lead the Federal Reserve to nudge rates up. But they will almost certainly be overshadowed during the Fed meeting by a patient, pragmatic approach championed by Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman. After the meeting adjourns, the Fed is expected to announce it is holding interest rates steady, at least until its next meeting on Aug. 18, economists said.
At the heart of the pragmatists' argument is the belief that growth is already slowing toward a noninflationary rate because of the financial crisis in Asia and perhaps the strike that has nearly shut down General Motors. Moreover, raising rates now could further destabilize Asia and emerging economies from Russia to Brazil.
In any case, the American economy has exhibited a surprising ability for several years to grow at robust rates without setting off inflationary wage and price spirals. Mr. Greenspan himself even put aside the dour mien that has long been his trademark and a few weeks ago proclaimed the economy to be just about the best he had ever seen.
David Orr, the chief economist at First Union Corporation's capital markets group, said the economy was shifting from a Goldilocks stage -- neither too hot nor too cold -- into a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde stage in which it exhibited contradictory characteristics.
Asia's crisis has had a substantial impact on farmers and manufacturers that export chemicals, electrical equipment, lumber and textiles, he said, helping to slow the overall economy's growth to 2 percent or less this spring and summer.
But at the same time, he said, consumer spending remains strong, incomes continue to grow and business investment in computers and other equipment remains heavy.
"I don't see Alan Greenspan raising rates unless the manufacturing sector shows some rebound, which I don't see happening this year," Mr. Orr said. "On the other hand, the fundamentals of private sector domestic demand are just so solid that demand is really exceeding supply in areas like housing, an awful lot of service and retail areas and commercial construction. So inflation is going up in those areas."
The result, Mr. Orr said, is to keep the Fed trapped between conflicting forces, with monetary policy on hold until inflation becomes a clear threat or the economy becomes so sluggish that it needs to be reinvigorated by a rate cut.
"Our bet is that the strength of underlying U.S. domestic demand prevails, and that by spring of next year, or something of that order, they do raise rates," Mr. Orr said. "But it's a close bet."
The best clues to how the Fed is handling the situation could come not in the expected terse announcement on Wednesday that the Federal Open Market Committee has left rates unchanged, but in the minutes, to be released on Thursday, of the committee's May 19 meeting.
At the previous meeting, on March 31, the Fed left rates unchanged but formally signaled that it expected the next move on interest rates to be upward -- in essence an early warning to the markets that if the expected slowdown in growth did not happen it would probably tighten policy.
The May 19 minutes will disclose whether that policy bias was left in place. It will provide a synopsis of the debate between the pragmatists on the committee and those members who see inflation as more of an immediate threat.
Foremost among the inflation hawks is Jerry L. Jordan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, who alone among the committee's 12 members voted to raise rates at the March 31 meeting.
Mr. Jordan's vote was based in part on his concern about the rapid growth in the money supply, a development that has a number of other Fed officials worried. Money supply growth has fallen out of favor in the last decade as a proxy for inflation pressures, but some economists are now arguing that the link has been at least partly re-established.
Economists said they would be closely watching Thursday's employment report, which will provide the clearest look yet at whether growth began slowing in earnest in June. Most economists expect a slight uptick in the unemployment rate, to 4.4 percent, and a slowdown in job creation, to a little more than 200,000 in June from 296,000 in May.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA;
Questions for the President: Give and Take With China's Students

 BODY:
Following are key sections from the question-and-answer part of President Clinton's appearance yesterday at Beijing University, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company. Beijing University selected the students for the audience, allotting each academic department a set number. Their questions were translated by an interpreter.
Q. Mr. President, I'm very delighted to be -- very honored to be -- the first one to raise a question. Just as you mentioned in your address, Chinese and American people should join hands and move forward together. And what is most important in this process is for us to have more exchanges. In our view, since China is opening up in reform, we have had better understanding of the culture, history and literature of America. And we have also learned a lot about you from the biography, and we have also learned about a lot of American Presidents. And we have also seen the movie "Titanic." 
 But it seems that the American people's understanding of Chinese people is not as much as the other way around. Maybe they have only -- they are only seeing China -- through several movies describing the Cultural Revolution or rural life. So my question is: As the first President of the United States visiting China in 10 years, what do you plan to do to enhance the real understanding and the respect between our two peoples? Thank you.
A. First of all, I think that's a very good point. And one of the reasons that I came here was to try to -- because, as you can see, a few people come with me from the news media -- I hoped that my trip would help to show a full and balanced picture of modern China to the United States and that, by coming here, it would encourage others to come here and others to participate in the life of China.
I see a young man out in the audience who introduced himself to me yesterday as the first American ever to be a law student in China. So I hope we will have many more Americans coming here to study, many more Americans coming here to be tourists, many more Americans coming here to do business. The First Lady this morning and the Secretary of State had a meeting on a legal project. We're doing a lot of projects together with the Chinese to help promote the rule of law. That should bring a lot more people here.
I think there is no easy answer to your question. It's something we have to work at. We just need more people involved in more kinds of contacts. And I think the more we can do that, the better.
 
CHINA AND TAIWAN
 Q. Mr. President, as a Chinese, I'm very interested in the reunification of my motherland. Since 1972, progress has been made on the Taiwan question. But we have seen that the Americans have repeatedly been selling advanced weapons to Taiwan. And to our great indignation, we have seen that the United States and Japan have renewed the U.S.-Japan security treaty. And according to some Japanese officials, this treaty even includes the Taiwan province of China.
So I have to ask, if China were to send its inaudible missile to Hawaii and if China were to sign a security treaty with other countries against one part of United States, would the United States agree to such an act or would the American people agree to such an act?
A. First of all, United States policy is not an obstacle to the peaceful reunification of China and Taiwan. Our policy is embodied in three communiques and in the Taiwan Relations Act. Our country recognized China and embraced a one-China policy almost 20 years ago. And I reaffirmed our one-China policy to President Jiang in our meetings.
Now, when the United States and China reached agreement that we would have a one-China policy, we also reached agreement that the reunification would occur by peaceful means. And we have encouraged the cross-strait dialogue to achieve that.
Our policy is that any weapons sales, therefore, to Taiwan must be for defensive purposes only and that the country must not believe -- China must not believe that we are in any way trying to undermine our own one-China policy. It is our policy. But we do believe it should occur -- any reunification should occur peacefully.
Now, on Japan, if you read the security agreement we signed with Japan, I think it will be clear from its terms that the agreement is not directed against any country, but rather in support of stability in Asia. We have forces in South Korea that are designed to deter a resumption of the Korean War across the dividing line between the two Koreas.
Our forces in Japan are largely designed to help us to promote stability anywhere in the Asia-Pacific region on short notice. But I believe that it is not fair to say that either Japan or the United States have a security relationship that is designed to contain China. Indeed, what both countries want is a security partnership with China for the 21st century.
Just for example, you mentioned NATO. We have expanded NATO in Europe, but we also have made a treaty, an agreement, between NATO and Russia to prove that we are not against Russia anymore. And the most important thing NATO has done in the last five years is to work side by side with Russia to end the war in Bosnia.
And I predict to you that what you see us doing with China now, working together to try to limit the tension from the Indian and the Pakistani nuclear tests, you will see more and more and more of that in the future. And I think you will see a lot of security cooperation in that area. And we can't see the agreements of today through the mirror of yesterday's conflicts. . . .
 
HIDING BEHIND A SMILE?
 Q. Mr. President, I'm from the class of '97. I'm very glad to have this opportunity to ask you a question. With a friendly smile, you have set foot on the soil of China and you have come to the inaudible . So we are very excited and honored by your presence. What the Chinese people really aspire for is the friendship between China and the United States on the basis of equality.
And I know that before your departure from the States, you said that the reason for you to visit China is because China is too important and engagement is better than containment. I'd like to ask you whether this is a kind of commitment you made for your visit, or do you have any other hidden things behind this smile? Do you have any other design to contain China? . . .
A. If I did, I wouldn't mask it behind a smile. But I don't. That is, my words mean exactly what they say. We have to make a decision. All of us do, but especially the people who live in large nations with great influence must decide how to define their greatness.
When the Soviet Union went away, Russia had to decide how to define its greatness. Would they attempt to develop the human capacity of the Russian people and work in partnership with their neighbors for a greater future, or would they remember the bad things that happened to them in the past 20 years and think the only way they could be great would be to dominate their neighbors militarily? They chose a forward course. The world is a better place.
The same thing is true with China. You will have to decide, both in terms of your policies within your country and beyond, what does it mean that China will be a great power in the 21st century? Does it mean that you will have enormous economic success? Does it mean you will have enormous cultural influence? Does it mean that you will be able to play a large role in solving the problems of the world? Or does it mean you will be able to dominate your neighbors in some form or fashion, whether they like it or not?
This is the decision that every great country has to make. You ask me, do I really want to contain China? The answer is no. If you look at -- the American people have always had a very warm feeling toward China that has been interrupted from time to time when we have had problems. But if you go back through the history of our country, there's always been a feeling on the part of our people that we ought to be close to the Chinese people.
And I believe that it would be far better for the people of the United States to have a partnership on equal, respectful terms with China in the 21st century than to have to spend enormous amounts of time and money trying to contain China because we disagree with what's going on beyond our borders. I think it would -- so I do not want that.
I want a partnership. I'm not hiding another design behind a smile. That's what I really believe. I believe it, not because -- because I think it's good for the American people. And it's my job to do what's good for them. What's good for them is to have a good relationship with you. . . .
 
EDUCATION AND THE ECONOMY
Q. Several years ago you proposed the concept of a knowledge economy. So my first question is, what do you think of higher education -- what kind of role can this play in the future's knowledge economy? And the second question is, what expectations do you have, Mr. President, for the younger generation of our two countries?
A.Let me answer the knowledge economy question first. And let me answer by telling you what I have tried to do in the United States. I have tried to create a situation in America in which the doors of universities and colleges are open to every young person who has sufficient academic achievement to get in, that there are no financial burdens of any kind. And we have not completely achieved it, but we have made a great deal of progress.
Now, why would I do that? Because I believe that the more advanced an economy becomes, the more important it is to have a higher and higher and higher percentage of people with a university education. Let me just tell you how important it is in the United States. We count our people. You know, every 10 years we do a census and we count the numbers of the American people and we get all kinds of information on them.
In the 1990 census, younger Americans who had a college degree were overwhelmingly likely to get good jobs and have their incomes grow. Younger Americans who had two years or more of university were likely to get good jobs and have their incomes grow. Younger Americans who didn't go to university at all were likely to get jobs where their incomes declined and were much more likely to be unemployed.
And the more advanced China's economy becomes, the more that will be true of China, the more you will need very large numbers of people getting university education and technical education. So I think it is very, very important.
Now, let me say one expectation I have for the younger generation of Americans and Chinese that has nothing to do with economics. One of the biggest threats to your future is a world which is dominated not by modern problems but by ancient hatreds. Look around the world and see how much trouble is being caused by people who dislike each other because of their racial or their religious or their ethnic differences, whether it's in Bosnia or the conflict between the Indians and the Pakistanis or in the Middle East or the tribal conflicts in Africa. You look all over the world, you see these kind of problems.
Young people, I think, are naturally more open to others who are different, more interested in people who are different. And I hope young people in China and young people in America who have a good education will be a strong voice in the world against giving in to this sort of hating people or looking down on them simply because they're different.
Q. Mr. President, with regard to the question of democracy, human rights and freedom, actually this is an issue of great interest to both the Chinese and American peoples. But to the inaudible our two countries have some differences over these issues. In your address just now, you made a very proud review and retrospection of the history of America's democracy and of human rights. And you have also made some suggestions for China. Of course, those sincere suggestions we welcome. But I think I recall one saying; that is, we should have both criticism and self-criticism.
So now I'd like to ask you a question. Do you think in the United States today there are also some problems in the area of democracy, freedom and human rights, and what has your Government done to improve the situation?
A. I do. And first of all, let me say I never raise this question overseas in any country, not just China, without acknowledging first that our country has had terrible problems in this area -- keep in mind, slavery was legal in America for many years -- and that we are still not perfect. I always say that, because I don't think it's right for any person to claim that he or she lives in a perfect country. We're all struggling toward ideals to live a better life. So I agree with the general point you make.
Now, I will give you two examples. We still have some instances of discrimination in America in housing or employment or other areas based on race. And we have a system set up to deal with it, but we have not totally eliminated it. And in the last year, I have been engaging the American people in a conversation on this subject and we have tried to identify the things that Government should do, the things that the American people should do either through the local government or through other organizations, and the attitudes that should change the minds and hearts of the American people. That's one example.
Now, let me give you another example. We have -- when I ran for President in 1992, I was in a hotel in New York City and an American immigrant from Greece came up to me and he said, "My son is 10 years old, and he studies the election in the schools, and he says I should vote for you." But he said, "If I vote for you, I want you to make my son free, because my son is not really free."
So I asked this man, "What do you mean?" And he said, "Well, the crime is so high in my neighborhood -- there are so many guns and gangs -- that my son does not feel that -- I can't let him walk to school by himself or go across the street to play in the park. So if I vote for you, I want you to make my son free."
I think that's important, because, see, in America, we tend to view freedom as the freedom from government abuse or from government control. That is our heritage. Our founders came here to escape the monarchy in England. But sometimes freedom requires affirmative steps by government to give everyone an equal opportunity to have an education and make a decent living and to preserve a lawful environment.
So I've worked very hard to try to bring the crime rate down in America, and it's now lower than it has been at any time in 25 years, which means that more of our children are free. But the crime rate is still too high. There's still too much violence. So we Americans need to be sensitive not only to preserve the freedoms that we hold dear, but also to create an environment in which people can build a truly good and free life. . . .
 
THE NATURE OF FREEDOM
 Q. . . . I don't think individual freedom and collective freedom will contradict each other. For instance, in China the prosperous development of the nation is actually the free choice of our people, and it's also the result of their efforts.
So I think freedom, real freedom, should mean for the people to freely choose the way of life they like, and also to develop. And I also think that only those who can really respect the freedom of others can really say that they understand what freedom means. I don't know whether you agree with me or not.
A. No, I do agree with that. I think, first of all, if you believe in freedom, you have to respect the freedom of others to make another choice. And even societies that have rather radical views of individual freedom recognize limits on that freedom when it interferes with preserving other people's rights.
For example, there's one of our famous court cases which says we have freedom of speech, but no one should be free to shout the word "fire" in a crowded movie theater where there is no fire and cause people to stampede over each other. There's another famous court decision which says my freedom ends where the other person's nose begins, meaning that you can't -- you don't have the freedom to hit someone else.
So I agree with that. People have the freedom to choose, and you have to respect other people's freedoms. And they have the right to make decisions that are different from yours. And there will never be a time when our systems and our cultures and our choices will be completely identical. That's one of the things that makes life interesting. . . .
 
DEFICITS AND PROTESTS
 Q. Mr. President, I have two questions. The first question is: the U.S. economy has been growing for more than inaudible months. So I'd like to ask, apart from your personal contribution to the United States, what other factors do you think important for the success of the U.S. economy? Maybe they can serve as good reference for China.
The second question is, when President Jiang Zemin visited Harvard University last year, there were a lot of students outside the hall staging demonstrations. So I'd like to ask you, President, if today you are in Beijing University and if there were a lot of students outside protesting and demonstrating, what feeling would you have?
A. Well, first of all, on the United States economy, I believe that the principal role of Government policy since I've been President was to, first of all, get our big Government deficit -- we had a huge annual deficit in spending. We got that under control. We're about to have the first balanced budget in 30 years. That drove interest rates down and freed up a lot of money to be invested in creating jobs in the private sector.
Then the second thing we did was to expand trade a lot, so we began to sell a lot more around the world than we had before. And the third thing we did was to attempt to invest more in our people, in research, development, technology and education.
Now, in addition to that, however, a lot of the credit here goes to the American people themselves. We have a very sophisticated business community. They were investing money in new technologies and in new markets and in training people. We have an environment where it's quite easy for people to start a business.
And perhaps this is the area that might be most helpful to China. I know that my wife has done a lot of work around the world in villages trying to get credit to villagers so they could borrow money to start their own businesses, to try to take advantage of some skill they have. And we have seen this system work even in the poorest places in Africa and Latin America, where opportunity takes off. So we have tried to make it easy in America for people to start a business, to expand a business and to do business.
And then we have also tried very, very hard to get new opportunities into areas where there were none before. And all these things together, but especially -- I give most of the credit to the people of my country. After all, a person in my position, we're supposed to have correct policies so that we create a framework within which the American people then create the future. And I think that is basically what has happened.
Now, you asked me an interesting question. Actually, I have been demonstrated against quite a lot in the United States. I told President Jiang when he was there, I was glad they demonstrated against him so I didn't feel so lonely.
But what I think is -- let me just -- I'll give you a serious answer. If there were a lot of people demonstrating against me outside, suppose they were demonstrating over the question that the first gentleman asked me. Suppose they said, "Oh, President Clinton is trying to interfere with the peaceful reunification of China and Taiwan, and he shouldn't be selling them any weapons whatever."
Well, I would try to find out what they were demonstrating against, and then I would ask my hosts if they minded if I would go over and talk to them, or if they would mind if one or two people from the group of demonstrators could be brought to see me and they could say what is on their minds and I could answer.
Remember what I said before about what Benjamin Franklin said. "Our critics are our friends, for they show us our faults." You have asked me some very good questions today that have an element of criticism in them. They have been very helpful to me. They have helped me to understand how what I say is perceived by others, not just in China but around the world.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Wall St. Is Bolstered by Strengthened Overseas Trading

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
An end-of-quarter buying spree and lack of concern about coming economic reports pushed major stock market indexes higher yesterday.
Wall Street was also bolstered as stronger markets overseas, especially in Asia, eased some investors' concerns about the drag those economies could have on United States corporate profits. 
 Japan and most other Asian stock markets were higher, buoyed by news that a widely followed survey of Japanese business managers, known as the tankan, showed the businessmen were more optimistic than expected that business conditions in that country would improve within the next three months.
On the domestic economic front, however, Asia's current recession, left many investors confident that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to lift short-term interest rates at the end of its two-day policy-making session, which begins today. Investors also showed little concern, traders said, that the June employment report, due out Thursday, would rattle the stock market.
Although stocks finished higher yesterday, investor selling throughout the day pushed market indexes off the day's highs. The selling was evidence, analysts said, that while the near-term scenario appears rosy, a dose of skepticism remains about the outlook for corporate profits in the second half of the year.
After gaining more than 100 points, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,997.36, up 52.82 points. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.29 points, to 1,138.49, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 21.55 points, to 1,891.08.
"People are still concerned about Asia, but it's not a day-to-day thing," said Robert Basel, head of listed trading at Salomon Smith Barney.
Most investors' attention will be focused on second-quarter earnings reports in the next few weeks, he said. Over all, the feeling is that "now you'll get the good news" since most companies that anticipated an earnings decline have already warned of shortfalls, he said.
Analysts' forecasts compiled by the First Call Corporation, a Boston-based research firm, call for the earnings of companies that make up the Standard & Poor's 500 index to grow by about 3.6 percent in the second quarter.
Since those earnings numbers have been reduced from about 12 percent at the beginning of the year, most companies should meet or exceed those lowered forecasts, said George Jacobsen, chief investment officer at Trevor, Stewart, Burton & Jacobsen Inc., a New York investment management firm.
But the worst from Asia is not over, Mr. Jacobsen cautioned, adding that as governments take steps to alleviate the region's banking crisis, a rise in imports could occur to put pressure on American companies' earnings prospects in the second half of this year.
"In the first quarter, corporate profits were viewed as being an industry specific problem," Mr. Jacobsen said.
"In the second quarter, we're calling it a short-term problem. But our take is there is a corporate profit problem and it is long term."
Charles W. Johnson, head equity trader at Blaylock & Partners in Baltimore, said: "It still will be very interesting to see how third-quarter profits will shape up. I'm one of those people that has to be shown that my way of thinking is flawed and I just don't believe this market is out of the woods."
In addition to Asia, Mr. Johnson said he is concerned that consumer spending, which has helped buoy the market, will falter later in the year.
Most stocks that have gained in recent days are issues that had been battered in previous weeks, such as Microsoft, Intel and Disney, said Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. Companies Mr. Acuff calls consistent growers, or large-capitalization stocks that are leaders in their industries, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, American International Group and Home Depot, have also done well, illustrating investors' concern about future economic and profit growth, he said.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	Treasuries Fall
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32 yesterday, to 106 29/32, as the dollar declined, and investors held off buying before the two-day Federal Reserve meeting. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.64 percent, from 5.63 percent Friday.

HEADLINE: Officials Are Drawing Closer in Effort to Sell Coliseum

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
City and state officials inched closer yesterday to the end of a 14-year effort to sell the New York Coliseum, one of the most valuable parcels of real estate in Manhattan, even as they failed once again to meet a self-imposed deadline.
Two developers -- Stephen M. Ross, who formed a joint venture with Time Warner Inc., and Millennium Partners -- have emerged in recent weeks as the leading contenders to buy the 3.4-acre parcel along Columbus Circle, opposite Central Park, and build a 2.1-million-square-foot complex. 
 But given the complicated history of the sale and the sometimes fierce rivalry between city and state officials, the final outcome is still uncertain. It is clear, however, that the Coliseum site will sell for at least $340 million, $175 million more than officials had expected in 1996, executives involved in the bidding said.
Executives from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the Coliseum exhibition hall and an office tower on the parcel, and their real estate adviser, Benjamin V. Lambert, met yesterday with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to discuss final negotiations and a sales contract for the site. The Mayor has veto power over the project under a prior agreement with the M.T.A.
The M.T.A. had planned to select a winner at its board meeting today, but the agency's selection committee did not complete its analysis. E. Virgil Conway, the chairman of the M.T.A., is now expected to call a special meeting of the board within the next 10 days, or wait until the monthly board meeting in late July.
"Most people will welcome a resolution," said Ester R. Fuchs, director of the Barnard-Columbia Center for Urban Policy. "This project has been tossed and turned by competing levels of government and the volatility of the real estate market, which defies any kind of rational planning process. But I'd be surprised if we get an airtight sale with an outcome that'll make local residents happy."
The project already faces opposition from neighboring residents and the Committee for Environmentally Sound Development, a grass-roots group, which filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court challenging the development on environmental grounds. No matter who wins the bidding, the group says, the giantproject will worsen traffic congestion and air pollution in the area.
City and state officials have looked at a number of issues in assessing the bids -- including price, design and how the project would fit into the city's economic development -- though critics have complained that the cash-strapped M.T.A. has been concerned only with money. In the latest attempt to sell the site, the M.T.A. culled five finalists last year from a large group of bidders and sought assurances from developers that a sale would proceed despite any litigation. Millennium Partners, which would build 450 apartments, a ballroom and two luxury hotels on the site, has offered one of the strongest guarantees.
But the development group, led by Christopher M. Jeffries, has not been lucky. The M.T.A. was on the verge of selling the site to Millennium a year ago when Mayor Giuliani suddenly upended the process, vowing to block the project unless the development included a theater or performance space. The subsequent delay wreaked havoc on some of the developers' plans, but the real estate market continued to improve, as did the offers for the site. Oddly enough, Mr. Jeffries had been in negotiations with Jazz at Lincoln Center to build a music center at a different location.
In February, the city completed a deal to incorporate a concert hall and home for Jazz at Lincoln Center into any new development at the site. The finalists then resubmitted their bids on April 30 with plans for the 100,000-square-foot jazz complex, which developers said would cost them $40 million to $50 million to build.
Mr. Ross, the chairman of the development concern The Related Companies, has the one element missing from the other proposals: a blue-chip tenant. He is proposing to build a world headquarters for Time Warner, and the largest digital-television production studio in the city. Time Warner would install both the New York 1 cable news channel and the New York operations of CNN at the 100,000-square-foot studio. The complex would also include a luxury Mandarin Oriental hotel, 325 condominiums and a large block of retail space.
Donald J. Trump, who was ready to drop out of the process in January, ultimately submitted the highest bid, about $370 million, but his bulky design is considered the weakest, according to officials who have scrutinized the competing offers. The other bidders are clustered between $330 million and $345 million.
One city official said yesterday that the situation was somewhat fluid and that not even Mr. Trump could be counted out. Tishman Speyer Properties has proposed a mixed-use complex, and a team composed of the developers Daniel Brodsky, Bruce C. Ratner and Peter M. Lehrer has planned for a 700-room Westin hotel, apartments and a Sears department store.

HEADLINE: Whitman in Deal to Raise Gas Tax 4 cents

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 29

 BODY:
Overcoming opposition from some Republican lawmakers reluctant to raise taxes, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman reached agreement with legislative leaders today to increase the state's gasoline tax gradually -- 4 cents a gallon over three years -- to help pay for transportation projects around the state.
The tax increase is 3 cents less a gallon than what Governor Whitman proposed in May. Two of those cents would have gone toward preserving a million acres of farmland and open space, nearly half the undeveloped land left in the state. But lawmakers are now considering another proposal to ask voters whether they would support a plan to borrow $1 billion over 30 years for preserving open space. The other proposed 1-cent increase would have been spent on transportation projects. 
 Motorists would not see the full impact of the 4-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax at the pumps all at once. Under the plan, the gasoline tax would rise by a penny next year, 2 cents the following year and 1 cent more in the year 2001. The increase would be contingent on voters' approval of a referendum in November, which would ask them whether they supported a gasoline tax increase and whether they approved dedicating all motor vehicle tax revenues to transportation projects.
"I believe that this is the right thing to do," said the Assembly Speaker, Jack Collins, a Republican from Salem County. "I am sure that this will be a bipartisan effort."
The agreement on the gasoline tax increase came as both the Assembly and the Senate gave final approval to a new $18.2 billion state budget for the new fiscal year beginning July 1. The budget raises spending by almost $1 billion over this year for public schools, state colleges and a handful of other programs. And it puts $661 million aside for the state's rainy day fund.
With the gasoline tax increase, the Whitman administration expects to spend $200 million more on transportation projects in the next two years than had been budgeted. The increase would allow the state to pay the higher borrowing costs for expanding the state's Transportation Trust Fund, the system used to finance highway and mass transit projects. Administration officials said spending would rise to $900 million from $700 million in 1999 and 2000. It would increase to $950 million annually in the following three years.
After lawmakers rejected the 2-cent-a-gallon increase for open space preservation, Governor Whitman continued to push for a 5-cent-a-gallon increase for transportation projects. But lawmakers, particularly Republican members of the General Assembly who face re-election next year, balked at raising taxes while the state's economic boom was pouring extra revenues into the state's coffers.
Although the plan will produce about $400 million less in estimated new revenues from the gasoline tax than what the administration first proposed, her aides said that the 4-cent-a-gallon increase, phased in over three years, would meet the administration's goals for transportation.
"It works," said Pete McDonough, chief spokesman for Governor Whitman. "We can get a program large enough to meet the needs of the state."
Mr. Collins said the Legislature would return in late July to consider the gasoline tax increase. At the end of three years, it would raise state taxes on gasoline to 18.5 cents a gallon from 14.5 cents. Mr. Collins also said the Legislature would consider two other bills, asking voters to dedicate motor vehicle tax revenues for transportation projects and support the 30-year borrowing plan to preserve a million acres of farmland and other open space.
The state budget, which Governor Whitman is expected to sign into law on Tuesday, was approved by the Legislature with bipartisan support for the first time in almost a decade. Democrats were able to share some of the budget surplus with their Republican colleagues for various projects in their legislative districts. The total spending for legislative projects was $60 million.
But some Democrats voted against the budget because of language that the Whitman administration had quietly inserted that would establish a state-appointed fiscal review board to oversee the city of Camden's finances. The city is looking for a $15 million bailout from the state to balance its books, and the administration insists the money would only be allocated if a state-run financial review board is in place.
Milton Milan, the Mayor of Camden, said that he would welcome the state's playing an active role in overseeing the city's finances, but he opposed the Governor's plan that allows her to appoint all seven members of the newly created financial review board. State Senator Wayne R. Bryant, a Democrat from Camden, said that the Whitman administration was overstepping its authority under the state constitution. "The administration is violating the trust of Camden residents and undermining the good-faith efforts of Camden officials to restore fiscal order to New Jersey's poorest city," he said.

HEADLINE: Flurry of Anti-Gay Remarks Has G.O.P. Fearing Backlash

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29

 BODY:
Prominent Republican politicians and strategists say they are troubled by a wave of harsh anti-homosexual oratory from other Republicans, fearing it could make the party appear intolerant and drive out moderates and economic conservatives.
The concerns are not limited to moderate Republicans. Many conservatives said the recent attacks on homosexuality by party leaders, candidates and local Republican officials could spur a reprise of the 1992 Presidential campaign, when intramural skirmishes over issues like abortion turned off the wider electorate in the general election. 
 Several Republicans said blunt comments like those made by Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi in a television interview on June 15 stemmed from a determination among some in the party to score points with the right wing and energize hard-core Republican voters. Senator Lott, the Republican leader, had likened homosexuality to kleptomania, alcoholism and sex addiction.
But many Republicans condemned the attacks as short-sighted. "The Republican Party has tripped over its own shoelaces and found itself on the defensive," said Ralph Reed, a Republican strategist and former head of the Christian Coalition.
And Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, took issue with colleagues who contended that comments like Mr. Lott's might energize the party. "I don't believe the party is likely to grow stronger or our voters more numerous through attacks on minorities," he said, "whether they be sexual minorities or religious or racial minorities."
Most accept that the remarks by Mr. Lott and by those supporting him, like Representative Dick Armey, the majority leader, and many others, reflect their genuine belief that homosexuality is a sin. But the comments also reflect a new willingness among Republicans to speak bluntly instead of couching their beliefs in politically agreeable language.
The shift appears to have been spurred by conservative leaders, notably Gary L. Bauer of the Family Research Council and Dr. James C. Dobson of the "Focus on the Family" radio talk show. They and others are pressing lawmakers to emphasize their opposition to homosexuality as part of a social-issues agenda.
"There's been a demand from some quarters that we aggressively attack the homosexual community," said Representative Joe Scarborough of Florida, one of the most conservative House members. Though he said the comments made some Republicans look like "strident, right-wing cartoon characters," Mr. Scarborough added: "There's not a real political downside right now. I don't think there are going to be a lot of horrified soccer moms."
Mr. Scarborough, who is 35, said his position on gay rights was probably not much different from Mr. Lott's or others who have spoken out. Yet he suggested that there was a generational difference, and that younger people like himself were more careful about their language because "we have all had friends who are gay and understand that they are not the demons that they're made out to be."
Although some Republicans conceded that their party could not expect wide support from gay rights advocates, they said their biggest worry was that the wave of harsh comments would offend so-called swing voters in the suburbs who are not particularly loyal to one party.
John McLaughlin, a Republican pollster, said his surveys showed that the attacks on homosexuality offended voters even in the most conservative parts of the South. "In a lot of areas, this is not a threat to their values and their hometowns and their communities," he said of homosexuality. But by raising the issue, he said, "it makes Republicans look out of touch, like they care about things the voters don't care about."
Mr. McLaughlin said his polling also found that the anti-gay oratory made Republicans look mean-spirited. "What they always liked about Ronald Reagan was that he might have been anti-gay, but he wasn't somebody who disliked people," Mr. McLaughlin said.
But William W. Pascoe 3d, political director of the American Conservative Union, said the anti-gay oratory would benefit Republicans. "Any time you have Republican leaders citing the Bible as the foundation for their beliefs, as opposed to Democratic leaders citing the American Psychiatric Association, I think we win," he said.
Other conservatives disagreed. When Mr. Reed was executive director of the Christian Coalition, he was careful not to attack homosexuals directly but instead capitalized on the issue by using code words, noting, for example, the coalition's belief in the "sanctity of marriage."
The risk that Mr. Reed and other Republicans spoke of could not be measured. But they said they feared that the comments could cost the party not only moderates who favor homosexual rights but quite conservative Republicans who might consider attacks on homosexuality mean-spirited or inappropriate for a party that should concern itself with more pressing legislative matters.
Although leading Republicans insisted that there was no orchestrated drive in the party to go after homosexuals, there has been a drumbeat of criticism in recent days. Some of the sharp remarks came from leading Republicans who were questioned about Mr. Lott's comments; others came about independently.
Mr. Lott's supporters said his remarks helped him with conservatives who were furious when he criticized the United States Navy last year for ousting First Lieut. Kelly Flinn on charges relating to adultery.
Several conservatives said comments in support of Mr. Lott by Mr. Armey, who wants to succeed Newt Gingrich as Speaker, were intended to help him win favor with conservative House members who believe he has not been honest in acknowledging his role in last year's failed coup against Mr. Gingrich.
"The Bible is very clear on this," Mr. Armey had said, adding that "both myself and Senator Lott believe very strongly in the Bible."
In an interview published today, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, a longtime foe of homosexuality, stepped up his criticism. "They start by pretending that it is just another form of love," he told Congressional Quarterly. "It's sickening." Mr. Helms was responding to a new documentary that criticizes his treatment of homosexuals.
Asked about comments like Mr. Lott's, Senator John McCain of Arizona said, "I don't believe in discrimination of any kind." He said the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay organization, "should be part of our party."
The tensions are reminiscent of the 1996 Presidential contest, when Bob Dole's campaign was thrown into turmoil after it returned a contribution from the Log Cabin Republicans.
But Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican Party, said the denunciations of homosexuality could be politically beneficial because "when people are honest about their views, most people respect them."
Mr. Nicholson said of the comments: "I'm not concerned about what any of those leaders have said. I agree with them. I don't know that we fully understand very much about the sources of homosexuality or if there is a way to alter that. I've talked to some people in both the scientific and theological communities and they don't seem to be very clear about it."
Earlier this month, Republican leaders in Texas barred the Log Cabin Republicans from setting up a booth at the party's state convention. Robert Black, a party spokesman, inflamed the issue when he likened the group to the Ku Klux Klan.
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is weighing a bid for President in 2000, won praise from Mr. Reed and other Republicans for trying to tamp down the oratory from the state party. A statement issued by his office said: "Governor Bush believes all individuals deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. While he differs with the Log Cabin Republicans on issues such as gay marriage, he does not condone name calling."
That same weekend, at a gathering of Republican Presidential aspirants in Iowa, Mr. Bauer appeared with Reggie White, the Green Bay Packers star who had called homosexuality "one of the biggest sins in the Bible." And another prospective contender, Steve Forbes, appeared with the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, a vociferous critic of homosexuality.
Mr. Bauer said he spoke with Mr. Lott after he made his comments, and the Senator did not express regrets. "I told him to hang in there," Mr. Bauer recalled. "But he was feeling O.K. Apparently he got a lot of phone calls from people saying that they admired his courage."
As the debate continues among Republicans, this much is clear: Mr. Lott no longer wants to talk about homosexuals. Asked about his remarks, he replied, "I think enough has probably already been said about that." He then stuck out his tongue.

Mr. Lott went on to say, "You still love that person and you should not try to mistreat them or treat them as outcasts. You should try to show them a way to deal with that." Saying his father had a problem with alcoholism, he said, "Others have a sex addiction or are kleptomaniacs. There are all kinds of problems and addictions and difficulties and experiences of this kind that are wrong."
 
Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma
ASSISTANT MAJORITY LEADER
"I think it's immoral behavior."
 
Robert Black
SPOKESMAN FOR THE TEXAS REPUBLICAN PARTY
He likened the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay organization, to the Ku Klux Klan. Referring to the party's decision to ban the group from its state convention, he added, "We don't allow pedophiles, transvestites or cross-dressers, either."
 
Representative Dick Armey of Texas
MAJORITY LEADER
"The Bible is very clear on this," he said, adding that "both myself and Senator Lott believe very strongly in the Bible."
 
Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma
He is one of several senators who is holding up President Clinton's nomination of James Hormel, a gay businessman, as ambassador to Luxembourg. He likened Mr. Hormel to David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, saying of the nomination, "I would feel the same way if it were David Duke or anybody whose agenda is more important than the country."
 
Pat Robertson
CHAIRMAN OF THE CHRISTIAN COALITION AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN 1988
Referring to the Orlando, Fla., City Council's decision to permit rainbow banners to hang from city light poles during gay-pride celebrations: "I would warn Orlando that you're right in the way of some serious hurricane, and I don't think I'd be waving those flags in God's face if I were you." Last week, he cited the fires in Florida as an example of the punishment being exacted on Orlando.
 
Gary L. Bauer
PRESIDENT OF THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL, WHO IS CONSIDERING RUNNING FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
He defended anti-homosexuality comments by Reggie White, a star of the Green Bay Packers, saying, "Now CBS television has decided that Reggie White is an unfit spokesman for its pro football broadcasts. Why? Because the Rev. Reggie White had the nerve to stand in front of the Wisconsin legislature and speak his mind about homosexuality." (pg. A19)

HEADLINE: Chinese Immigrants Hail Clinton Trip, Citing Mutual Benefit

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
As President Clinton deflects criticism from politicians in the United States and students in Beijing over his trip to China, he is finding unwavering -- and somewhat surprising -- support from Chinese immigrants in New York City.
Regardless of whether they originally hailed from mainland China, Taiwan or Hong Kong, immigrants in the New York metropolitan area have applauded Mr. Clinton's trip, saying his mission benefits both the United States and China for economic, political and cultural reasons. 
 Last week, critics in Washington accused Mr. Clinton of kowtowing to a government with a human rights record that only brutal regimes would envy. Yesterday, Chinese students at Beijing University grilled Mr. Clinton, questioning whether the United States was secretly trying to isolate China politically.
But as Mr. Clinton continues his trip, interviews with more than two dozen Chinese immigrants over the last two days revealed a more practical assessment: human rights is secondary to economic progress and Sino-American relations. And anyone who disagrees with that, they say bluntly, simply does not understand China, or the Chinese people.
"I don't think most Americans understand why Clinton's trip is so good," said Daniel Chao, 35, of Edison, N.J., who grew up in Shanghai and was eating on Sunday at Joe's Shanghai in Flushing, Queens. "It's very important for the long-term Sino-American relationship that Clinton have a chance to get firsthand information, and talk about the real issues with the Chinese leaders and the Chinese people."
At the same time, the immigrants say, Mr. Clinton's trip has tremendous symbolic value for people who, invariably, place a lot of meaning on symbols and gestures.
"We are all Chinese, and this raises the profile of all Chinese people," said Johnson Wang, 67, of Jersey City, a Taiwanese-American who was purchasing lottery tickets at the Port Authority Bus Terminal on Sunday. "We are especially proud of the fact that this trip is nine days -- the longest ever by Clinton!"
At first glance, it might appear that Chinese immigrants would have disparate views. After all, Chinese immigrants in New York include the old guard from Taiwan and Hong Kong, who have been major backers of Taiwan's Nationalist Government, and political arrivistes from Fujian province in southern China, who have been partial to China's Communist Government. Throw in smaller segments of people whose agendas range from Taiwan independence to Tibetan independence, and the result is a fluid, vibrant community that agrees to disagree, more often than not.
But when it comes to matters of national or ethnic pride, many Chinese immigrants cast typical allegiances aside. Blood, not politics, prevails.
So it went with the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. So it went with President Jiang Zemin's visit to New York last fall. And so it has gone with Mr. Clinton's trip.
Not one of the immigrants interviewed failed to mention the eminence of economic reform and Sino-American trade relations when asked about the vital points of Mr. Clinton's trip. It is through economic reform, they say, that China will become a freer society.
"Contact is better than confrontation," said Mang Xu, 35, a Shanghai immigrant who was leafing through a book about Soong Ching-ling -- the wife of Sun Yat-sen -- in a Flushing bookstore. "If you open the economic door, then you'll open the political door."
Human rights, on the other hand, should not be given too much weight, the immigrants said.
Even the 1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square -- considered by many Americans to be the emblematic symbol of the Chinese regime -- was something that most Chinese-Americans viewed as an incident that, while tragic, should be consigned to history.
"What happened, happened," said Jane Eng, a Hong Kong immigrant and manager of the Nancy Wedding Center, a bustling bridal shop on the Bowery. "We cannot just sit here and wait for a conclusion. We have to take the first step."
Part of the reason why Chinese-Americans may appear to be relatively blase about human rights is that their definition of what a person's basic rights ought to be is different from what other Americans usually think.
"Human rights are the ability to have enough food, clothing, education and shelter," said Chunde Shi, 36, a former urban planner in Beijing who now works as a computer consultant in the New York region. "Only after you have these can you think about things like democracy and freedom."
Many Chinese immigrants said that the issue of human rights said as much about American attitudes as it did about anything in China.
Using an argument reminiscent of what some Chinese leaders used to defend their handling of the pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, the immigrants said that many Americans had a tendency to meddle in other countries' internal affairs, and that few had a genuine understanding of Chinese history or culture.
"America is hegemonistic; America likes to impose its values on other countries," said Zuken Li, a businessman in Chinatown who emigrated 10 years ago from Fujian province. "It's pretty funny, because America has only 200 or so years of history, while China has more than 5,000 years."
The immigrants also lauded Mr. Clinton for grasping Chinese customs and respecting their traditions. Mr. Clinton went to the ancient capital of Xian, the Forbidden City, and the Great Wall in a highly scripted, heavily symbolic itinerary with a nod to history. He behaved like a proper guest, the immigrants said, and was therefore rewarded with the Chinese Government's decision to broadcast his press conference live, and unedited.
But when President Jiang Zemin visited New York, he was snubbed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other local officials over China's dubious human rights record. Whatever one's politics, the immigrants said, welcoming a guest is a courtesy and a necessary protocol.
Of course, not everyone was focused on Mr. Clinton's trip. Some immigrants -- particularly those with blue-collar jobs in Chinatown -- said they were too burdened with work to devote much time to read, let alone think, about Mr. Clinton's trip.
But there is a Chinese saying that seems to capture the essence of China's situation, said Ms. Eng, the bridal shop manager. The saying -- zuo jing guan tian -- means seeing the sky from the bottom of a well, and having a narrow point of view.
China, she said, is like a frog at the bottom of the well. It only knows what it can see. America is at the top; it can see the whole world. So people should have patience, she said, while China -- with the help of the United States -- figures out a way to get out.

HEADLINE: 3 Democrats Assail D'Amato Then Attack One Another

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: BOLTON LANDING, N.Y., June 29

 BODY:
Sharing a stage for the first time in this campaign, the three Democratic candidates for Senate tangled today over their allegiance to the tobacco industry, fund-raising tactics and how President Clinton should deal with China.
The candidates -- Geraldine A. Ferraro, Mark Green and Charles E. Schumer -- struggled to keep the focus on the Republican incumbent, Alfonse M. D'Amato, and avoid the recriminations that marred the Democratic contest six years ago. But with just one more debate scheduled until the weekend before the Sept. 15 primary, the stakes here were significant, and the candidates' attempts at cordiality slipped more than once. 
 Mr. Green questioned Ms. Ferraro's judgment in accepting a $20,000 speaking fee from a tobacco company. Ms. Ferraro responded by accusing Mr. Green of taking a contribution from a tobacco industry ($50, as it turned out), and complained about Mr. Schumer's aggressive fund-raising effort. And the three candidates differed on some substantive issues, including the death penalty.
The exchanges came in a free-flowing debate sponsored by the New York State Broadcasters Association at the Sagamore Hotel, a picturesque retreat on Lake George. The hourlong late-morning session was moderated by Gabe Pressman of WNBC-TV in New York.
Ms. Ferraro, the 1984 Vice Presidential nominee, who is the best-known of the candidates and has a strong lead in most polls, has repeatedly declined attempts by her lesser-known colleagues to get her to share a stage with them. The debate she agreed to today seemed unlikely to win particularly widespread attention. It was situated in a relatively remote part of New York, almost 90 minutes by car from Albany, and it was not broadcast on television.
Most of the clashes among the Democrats were provoked by Mr. Green, the New York City Public Advocate, who has less money than either Mr. Schumer, a Congressman who represents Brooklyn and Queens, or Ms. Ferraro, and thus was arguably under the most pressure to make the most out this setting.
In one notable exchange, Mr. Green attacked Ms. Ferraro for accepting $20,000 to speak before a symposium sponsored by the Philip Morris Company in Palm Beach, Fla., last year, when she worked as a commentator on Crossfire, the CNN program. "I really hope that Geraldine would rethink the honorarium and give the money back," Mr. Green said.
Ms. Ferraro defended the fee, saying it had not prevented her from supporting tough measures aimed at tobacco companies in Congress. "Mark, I have no intention of giving the money back," Ms. Ferraro said. "As you well know, I paid taxes on it. And high taxes."
And then, seeking to turn the tobacco tables on Mr. Green, she said: "Mark, you've taken money from an officer of Philip Morris during your public advocate campaign."
"Who's that?" Mr. Green said, sitting upright in one of four easy chairs that had been set up on the stage.
Ms. Ferraro glanced down to the second row of the audience, where a press aide was sitting between her husband, John A. Zaccaro, and her campaign manager, David Eichenbaum. "Amanda, can -- " but Mr. Green cut off her attempt to seek assistance: "No, no, no, no, Geraldine."
After the debate, Mr. Eichenbaum identified the Philip Morris executive as David Dangoor, an executive vice president who he said had contributed $50, a minimal contribution by today's standards, to Mr. Green's campaign in 1993. Mr. Green said he did not know Mr. Dangoor, and would return the $50 if Ms. Ferraro returned the $20,000 she received.
The candidates were unified in attacking what they said were the shortcomings of Mr. D'Amato, whom they described as conservative, politically dishonest and a creature of his contributors. And all three signaled that they would focus on Mr. D'Amato's opposition to abortion rights.
"I am going to take the issue of choice to Al D'Amato and show the voters of New York he's an extremist," Mr. Schumer said.
Ms. Ferraro said: "He has even supported a constitutional amendment to ban abortion under all circumstances, even when the life of a mother is at stake. That is an issue, I have to tell you, that Republican women are looking at and saying, 'There is no way that we're going to allow this man to take that right away.' "
The Democrats disagreed with each other -- and with Mr. Clinton -- on how the United States should handle China. Mr. Schumer said Mr. Clinton should not have visited Tiananmen Square. "There was such a brutal massacre that I think you could draw the line and show the Chinese, yes I want to come, yes I want to engage you, but there are certain things you should not do."
And Mr. Green said he did not think the United States should continue awarding China most-favored-nation trade status, given the country's human rights record. Both Mr. Schumer and Ms. Ferraro endorsed Mr. Clinton's position that it would be an economic and political mistake to exclude China from world trade markets.
The candidates also clashed on the death penalty. Mr. Green, taking a position that is historically popular in Democratic primaries in New York and drawing a distinction between himself and his two opponents, strongly argued against capital punishment. "I don't believe it deters," he said.
Mr. Schumer found himself defending what he has presented as one of the bigger triumphs of his campaign: his aggressive fund-raising. He asserted that he needed to counteract Ms. Ferraro's name recognition and the fact that Mr. Green spent $2 million during an effectively uncontested bid for re-election as Public Advocate last year.
Mr. Schumer, who is a member of the Banking Committee, said "very little" of that money came from banking interests. But Ms. Ferraro asserted that she had firsthand knowledge that Mr. Schumer was soliciting from those sources.
"To be quite frank,," she said, "the reason I know that is if I call up and say, 'Hey listen, I'd love you to get involved in my campaign,' they say: 'I can't. D'Amato is on the Banking Committee. Schumer is on the Banking Committee. I can't give to you.' "
Ms. Ferraro said in response to a question that the campaign had followed a generally high road so far. Mr. Pressman looked startled at her response, and reminded Ms. Ferraro that she had called her rivals "liars" two weeks ago for denying they had strong-armed delegates at the Democratic state convention. He asked if she was rescinding it.
"Well, I don't know if I take that back," Ms. Ferraro said. "I am saying that that's behind us. I may have been a little tired then."
And although Ms. Ferraro said it was possible that she would agree to further encounters, she also said she did not view such sessions either as an efficient use of her time or enlightening to voters.
"Let me tell you that I ran for Vice President of the United States, in case anyone forgot," said Ms. Ferraro after the debate, referring to 1984, when she was the running mate to Walter F. Mondale. "You know how many debates I had with George Bush? One."

HEADLINE: Rockwell to Cut 3,800 Jobs and Spin Off Chip Unit

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 29

 BODY:
The Rockwell International Corporation's transformation to commercial electronics from the military business suffered a setback today when the company announced that it would spin off its semiconductor division to shareholders, cut 3,800 jobs and take a pretax charge of $625 million.
Rockwell, which made the B-1 bomber and the space shuttle, had been counting on the electronics business, which it saw as fast growing and glamorous, to carry it into the future. Rockwell had sold its military and aerospace businesses to the Boeing Company in 1996 for $3.2 billion and spun off its auto parts business last year into a publicly traded company, Meritor Automotive Inc. 
 But while fast growing, electronics, particularly semiconductors, can be extremely volatile. Rockwell, which is based in Costa Mesa, Calif., had been buffeted by plunging prices and slower than expected sales growth for personal computer modems, for which it is a major supplier of chips. Losses in the semiconductor division and pressure from shareholders led Rockwell to conclude that it did not have the stomach after all for boom and bust cycles and that the chip business did not mesh that well with its other, somewhat more predictable, businesses -- industrial automation equipment and avionics.
"These really are different businesses," Don H. Davis, chairman and chief executive, said today in an interview. Asked why Rockwell had not seen that a year ago, he pointed to the modem market. "We saw prices drop significantly more than we ever thought they would at the time and that changes the dynamics of the whole thing," he said.
In addition to the losses in its chip division, Rockwell's largest business, it is experiencing flat sales, in part because of the economic problems in Asia. While its avionics business remained strong, Rockwell said it would report lower than expected profits for the third fiscal quarter, which ends Tuesday, the second consecutive quarter with earnings below estimates.
Not counting the special charge, Mr. Davis said, earnings for the quarter are expected to be 30 cents a share, including the semiconductor business. But counting only continuing operations, earnings will be 45 cents a share, compared with 56 cents in last year's third quarter. Analysts had expected about 68 cents a share.
Sales for continuing operations will be about $1.7 billion, up 5 percent, the company said.
For the fiscal year, the company expects earnings a share from continuing operations of $2.30, compared with last year's $2.12, on sales of about $6.8 billion.
In response to the sluggish earnings, Mr. Davis, a company veteran who took over as chief executive last October and as chairman in February, today announced a major corporate overhaul, which he predicted will result in pretax savings of $100 million in the 1999 fiscal year and $200 million annually starting in 2001. Investors greeted the announcements with cautious optimism as the stock, which has fallen much of this year, climbed 56.25 cents, to $49.
Lior Bregman, an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer, said that Rockwell resisted divesting itself of its chip business at a time when it could have been sold for a high price. Now, he said, "they are doing it out of weakness rather than strength." He also speculated that the avionics or automation business might be divested at some point in the future because they did not seem to fit together well either.
The worker cutbacks, primarily in the automation business, amounted to more than 9 percent of the 41,000 Rockwell employees not in the semiconductor business. The chip division, which has 7,000 employees, is likely to have its own revamping later, though officials said there would not be too many layoffs.
The $625 million charge included $275 million of intangible asset writeoffs and good will mainly related to the company's Reliance Electric motor business and $160 million for severance costs.
The new semiconductor company, which does not yet have a name, will have revenues of about $1.3 billion, making it a midsized chip company.
The chip division had been a part of Rockwell for about 30 years. But it became a significant part of the company only in the last few years, with the divestiture of the aerospace and auto business, and with the boom in the sale of modems because of the popularity of the Internet.
Sales in the semiconductor division tripled from $530 million in the 1993 fiscal year to $1.59 billion in the 1996 fiscal year before leveling off in 1997. Modem chips account for about half the division's sales. But consumers had been hesitant to buy modems because of a format battle that erupted last year between Rockwell and a rival, U.S. Robotics, which is now part of the 3Com Corporation. Even though they have now agreed on a standard for the new modems, operating at 56 kilobits a second, sales have not fully recovered and prices have remained weak.

 
 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 1, 1998, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about plans by the Rockwell International Corporation to spin off its semiconductor division referred incorrectly to the size of that business and misstated the state of the company's overall sales. Automation equipment, not semiconductors, is Rockwell's biggest business. It is the automation business, not the company as a whole, that is experiencing flat sales.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Weaves Legal Principles From a Tangle of Litigation

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29

 BODY:
The Supreme Court aimed for clarity and, to an unusual degree, achieved it in the term that ended on Friday after a deluge of important rulings in the final week.
The Justices spoke forcefully in drawing a coherent rule on sexual harassment from a jumble of confusing judicial precedents and vague Congressional language. 
 They established a framework for applying a Federal disability law's protections to people with asymptomatic H.I.V. infection and other conditions that may not at first glance appear to qualify as disabling.
They quickly put to rest Congress's experiment with the line item veto as well as the independent counsel's effort to pierce the shield of the attorney-client privilege.
These decisions, and nearly all the others of the term's 91 rulings, were supported by clear majorities, free of the ambiguities that often plague the Court's efforts to wrestle with highly charged subjects.
Few Supreme Court decisions in recent memory have been received as enthusiastically across the spectrum of interested parties as the twin sexual harassment rulings, praised by women's rights leaders, the Chamber of Commerce and Federal trial judges alike for providing the first clear set of rules in this rapidly evolving area of employment law.
It is also true, however, that the Court was spared this term from having to deal with disputed areas of the law on which there is little common ground among the Justices. There were no federalism cases, for example. The last-minute settlement of an affirmative action case from Piscataway, N.J., which had raised the question of whether achieving diversity in the workplace could ever be a valid justification for racial preferences, left the Court for the first time in years without a case directly confronting questions of race.
There was also no religion case, a gap that could be filled quickly in the next term if the Justices decide to resolve the constitutionality of publicly subsidized vouchers for parochial school tuition. For reasons that were not clear, there were 31 decisions involving criminal law -- more than one-third of the docket, a much higher proportion than usual.
Of the term's 91 decisions -- up from 80 last year -- nearly half, 43, were decided by 9-to-0 votes, unanimous in result although not always in reasoning. Fifteen cases, including several of the term's most important, were decided by votes of 5 to 4.
These included the decision on the application of the Federal disability law to people with the virus that causes AIDS; a ruling that, in contrast to the other sexual harassment cases, took a restrictive view under a different Federal law of the rights of students to sue school districts for harassment by teachers; and a decision that the interest on short-term deposits that clients leave with their lawyers is the property of the clients, calling into question the current use of that money to help finance legal services programs for the poor.
The key to the outcome in 5-to-4 cases was the vote of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who voted in the majority in these cases and in all but 2 of the 15 in this category. Given the existing divisions on the Court, whichever side persuaded Justice Kennedy took a giant step toward winning the case.
Most of the time, with some significant exceptions, that was the conservative side. In 35 cases that found Justices John Paul Stevens and Antonin Scalia on opposite sides, a rough but reasonably accurate proxy for cases with some ideological content, Justice Kennedy voted 22 times with Justice Scalia, who along with Justice Clarence Thomas is the Court's most conservative member, and 13 times with Justice Stevens, arguably its most liberal.
Over the entire term, Justice Kennedy cast only five dissenting votes, a remarkably small number. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor tied for second in the category of fewest dissents, with 10 each. These three essentially defined the center of the Court. The most dissenting votes were cast by Justice Stevens, with 22, and Justice Scalia, with 19.
That Chief Justice Rehnquist, who joined the Court in 1971 and was a conservative voice in the wilderness for perhaps the first 15 years of his tenure, could be described as occupying the center of the Court is a measure of how the spectrum has shifted over the years.
While Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, along with Justice Stevens, are undoubtedly the Court's liberals, there were several reminders this term of how relative a label that is. For example, there were no dissents from an opinion by Justice Souter, in County of Sacramento v. Lewis, holding that the police cannot be found liable for injury or death from high-speed chases unless they acted with "a purpose to cause harm."
Some of the liveliest debates on the Court, in fact, are taking place not between liberals and conservatives, but within the conservative bloc itself. For example, the Court ruled in United States v. Bajakajian, a 5-to-4 decision by Justice Thomas, that a Government-imposed criminal forfeiture was unconstitutional as an "excessive fine."
The four liberals, whose skepticism of prosecutorial authority appeared to coalesce with Justice Thomas's solicitude for private property rights, voted in the majority. Justice Kennedy, who was joined in dissent by Chief Justice Rehnquist and by Justices Scalia and O'Connor, objected in angry tones that the Court was impeding the Federal Government's efforts to fight crime.
Two other decisions in criminal law cases left Justices Scalia and Thomas isolated as the only votes to uphold prosecution positions that the other Justices appeared to regard as extreme. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the majority opinions in both the cases, Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal and Bousley v. United States, granting inmates new Federal court hearings. In the Bousley case, Chief Justice Rehnquist said there was a "significant risk" that the defendant had been wrongly convicted, while a dissenting opinion by Justices Scalia and Thomas stressed the need for a "rule of finality."
Those two Justices also found themselves isolated in the two sexual harassment cases, decided by 7-to-2 votes on the term's final day.
These two decisions, for which the Supreme Court's 1997-98 term is likely to be best remembered, had little to do with ideology. Rather, they drew a broad majority together in a pragmatic search for "manageable standards," as Justice Souter put it in one of the majority opinions. Justice Thomas's objection that the Court was engaging in "willful policy making, pure and simple" could not shake the majority's resolve.
Here are summaries of the major rulings of the term, which began last Oct. 6 and ended June 26.
 
Sexual Harassment
The Court clarified the law of sexual harassment in the workplace, making some sexual harassment suits easier for employees to win and at the same time indicating how employers can limit their legal liability through adopting effective anti-harassment policies and complaint procedures.
The new rules came in a pair of decisions in separate cases that shared some crucial language. The vote in both was 7 to 2, with Justices Scalia and Thomas dissenting. Justice Souter wrote the majority opinion in Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, No. 97-282, making clear that employers are responsible for preventing and eliminating harassment in the workplace. They can be liable for even those harassing acts of supervisory employees that violate clear policies and of which top management has no knowledge.
In Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, No. 97-569, in an opinion by Justice Kennedy, the Court said an employee could sue even without being able to show job-related harm, but must have availed herself of effective complaint policies and other protection offered by the company.
In a third case, the Court expanded the category of people protected by Federal law against workplace harassment, ruling unanimously that the law covers harassment by people of the same sex. What matters, Justice Scalia said in his unanimous opinion in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, No. 96-568, is the conduct at issue, not the sex of the people involved and not the presence or absence of sexual desire, whether heterosexual or homosexual.
While ruling expansively in the employment cases, the Court interpreted a different law and set a highly restrictive standard for determining when a school district can be found liable under Federal law for a teacher's sexual harassment of a student. Voting 5 to 4, the Court said a victim can recover damages from the school district only if an official with authority to intervene knew of the situation and, acting with "deliberate indifference," failed to stop the harassment. Justice O'Connor wrote the majority opinion in Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, No. 96-1866, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas.
 
Line Item Veto
The Line Item Veto Act of 1996, giving the President the power to cancel provisions of statutes he has signed into law, is unconstitutional, the Court ruled, because the Constitution specifies the exclusive means for enacting laws and does not give the President the power to cancel portions or to amend them. The vote in Clinton v. City of New York, No. 97-1374, was 6 to 3, with Justice Stevens writing for the majority and Justices Scalia, Breyer and O'Connor dissenting.
 
Evidence
The Justices rejected an effort by the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, to persuade them to change the rules for the lawyer-client privilege after the client dies.
The privilege remains absolute, Chief Justice Rehnquist said in a 6-to-3 opinion that had the effect of blocking Mr. Starr's effort to get notes of a conversation that the former deputy White House counsel Vincent W. Foster Jr. had with a lawyer shortly before Mr. Foster committed suicide. Justices O'Connor, Scalia and Thomas dissented in Swidler & Berlin v. U.S., No. 97-1192, and said there should be a posthumous exception to the privilege for some criminal cases.
 
Discrimination
The Court made new law by ruling that the Americans with Disabilities Act offers protection against discrimination to people who are infected with the virus that causes AIDS, even if they show no symptoms of disease. The 5-to-4 majority applies the l990 law's definition of disability, an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, to a woman who said she had decided never to have children because of her H.I.V.-positive status. She sued under the law when a dentist refused to treat her in his office. Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in Bragdon v. Abbott, No. 97-156, joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.
Separately, the Court ruled unanimously that Congress intended the disability law to apply to inmates in state prisons. Justice Scalia wrote the opinion in Pennsylvania v. Yeskey, No. 97-686.
A splintered decision cast serious constitutional doubt on a Federal law that makes the American citizenship of foreign-born illegitimate children dependent on whether it was their mother or their father who was a United States citizen. If the mother is an American, the child can be deemed an American citizen at birth. But if citizenship is claimed through an American father, that parent must acknowledge paternity before the child turns 18. The law was challenged on equal-protection grounds by the Philippines-born daughter of a United States serviceman who did not acknowledge paternity until the daughter was 21.
Three Justices, Ginsburg, Breyer and Souter, found the law unconstitutional and two others, Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, suggested that it was. But the vote was nonetheless 6 to 3 to uphold it because Justices O'Connor and Kennedy said the daughter did not have standing to challenge the law; only the father did, they said, and he was not before the Court. The decision to uphold the law, Miller v. Albright, No. 96-1060, was written by Justice Stevens and joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist; in addition to Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, Justices Scalia and Thomas voted with the majority on separate grounds.
By a vote of 5 to 4, the Court rejected new, restrictive rules for an important category of civil rights suits against public officials that would have made it easier for such suits to be dismissed before trial, and even before pretrial discovery. Writing for the majority, Justice Stevens said that it was not the business of judges to change the law, as the Federal appeals court here did last year when it ruled that suits alleging that an official acted with an unconstitutional motive should be dismissed before trial unless the plaintiff offered "clear and convincing evidence" of the official's state of mind. Justices Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer and Souter joined the majority in Crawford-El v. Britton, No. 96-827, which reinstated a lawsuit by a District of Columbia prison inmate claiming that officials retaliated against him for exercising his right to free speech.
 
Free Speech
The Court upheld a decency test for awarding Federal arts grants, but only after a majority interpreted the 1990 law as containing only "advisory language" that did not actually prohibit Federal subsidies for indecent art. The vote in National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, No. 97-371, was 8 to 1, with a majority opinion by Justice O'Connor and a lone dissent by Justice Souter. Two members of the majority, Justices Scalia and Thomas, said the law did have real teeth but was constitutional anyway.
The Court ruled 6 to 3 that Government-owned television stations have the editorial discretion to exclude minor-party candidates from political debates, as long as the exclusion is not based on the candidate's views.
In his majority opinion, Arkansas Educational Television Commission v. Forbes, No. 96-779, Justice Kennedy said a candidate debate was not a public forum, like a street corner or a park, but a "nonpublic forum" subject to reasonable restrictions to prevent it from being overrun by unmanageable numbers of participants.
The case was brought by a former member of the American Nazi Party and self-described Christian supremacist who was running for Congress in Arkansas and sought access to a debate at a state-run public television station. Justices Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg dissented.
 
Criminal Law
A suspect's fear of prosecution overseas does not require the government to honor the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination which, the Court ruled in a 7-to-2 decision by Justice Souter that applies only in domestic criminal proceedings. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer dissented in U.S. v. Balsys, No. 97-873. The case grew out of the refusal by a suspected Nazi collaborator from Lithuania, in the United States for nearly 40 years, to testify in a preliminary investigation that could lead to his deportation and prosecution in Lithuania or Israel.
The Court ruled for the first time that a criminal forfeiture sought by the Government was unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of "excessive fines." A man whose only crime was failing to report that he was taking more than $10,000 out of the country could not be made to forfeit the entire amount of the undeclared cash, $357,144, as provided by the reporting statute, the Court held in a 5-to-4 decision by Justice Thomas. Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer joined the decision, U.S. v. Bajakajian, No. 96-1487.
A 9-to-0 decision made it unlikely that the police can ever be found liable for death or injury from high-speed chases. In an opinion by Justice Souter, the Court held that the police must have acted with "a purpose to cause harm" for victims to be able to establish liability; negligence or recklessness is not sufficient. The case was County of Sacramento v. Lewis, No. 96-1337.
The Court ruled, 8 to 1, that criminal defendants do not have a constitutional right to present evidence at trial of having passed a lie-detector test. The reliability of polygraphs has not been sufficiently established, Justice Thomas said in a majority opinion that overturned a ruling by the highest court in the military justice system. Justice Stevens dissented in the case, United States v. Scheffer, No. 96-1133.
The Court ruled, 5 to 4, that the exclusionary rule that bars prosecutors from introducing illegally seized evidence at trial does not apply to parole revocation hearings. Justice Thomas wrote the opinion in Pennsylvania Board of Probation v. Scott, No. 97-581.
The Court ruled, 7 to 2, that an untrue denial of guilt under questioning by a Federal investigator can itself be prosecuted as a crime under the Federal false-statements law. Most lower Federal courts, by contrast, had carved out an exception to the false-statements law for what was known as an "exculpatory no," a simple, self-protective denial of guilt under questioning. But Justice Scalia, writing for the Court in Brogan v. United States, No. 96-1579, said that there was nothing in the statute to validate such an exception and that if the "no" was a deliberate falsehood it could be prosecuted as a false statement. Justices Stevens and Breyer dissented.
 
State Courts
In a rare interpretation of the Constitution's "full faith and credit" clause, which generally obliges states to respect one another's legal judgments, the Court ruled 9 to 0 that notwithstanding that obligation, one state's court system cannot bind another's to an agreement barring particular testimony or evidence from a trial.
The case, Baker v. General Motors, No. 96-653, concerned an automobile industry whistle-blower who had agreed in a Michigan court settlement with the General Motors Corporation not to testify against the company as an expert witness. He was then subpoenaed by plaintiffs in a case against G.M. in Missouri. The Federal appeals court there barred the testimony on the basis of the Michigan court order. In her opinion overturning that ruling, Justice Ginsburg said Michigan lacked the authority to limit other states' courts in their "search for the truth."
 
Business
In one of its most important antitrust rulings in years, the Court ruled unanimously that manufacturers can set ceilings on retail markups without necessarily violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court overruled a 1968 precedent that had labeled as illegal price-fixing the practice known as resale price maintenance.
Justice O'Connor said that the earlier decision was based on bad economics and that limiting the price a retailer can charge can be good for consumers as well as good for the manufacturer's business. Under the new decision, State Oil v. Khan, No. 96-871, which began as a dispute between a gasoline supplier and a retail dealer, the legality of price ceilings will be based on a case-by-case analysis of the effect on competition.
By a 5-to-4 vote, the Court handed the banking industry an important victory in its battle against credit unions for the consumer banking dollar. The Court invalidated a 1982 Federal regulation that had permitted credit unions to expand far beyond their traditional base in tightly defined employee or community groups. The regulation did not properly interpret a 1934 Federal law that limited credit union membership to groups having a "common bond," Justice Thomas said in his opinion, National Credit Union Administration v. First National Bank & Trust Co., No. 96-843. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Kennedy, Ginsburg, and Scalia also voted in the majority.
A unanimous opinion virtually insured the continued flourishing of the multibillion-dollar "gray market" in unauthorized imports. The Court ruled that copyright law is of no use to a manufacturer seeking to block the domestic resale of American-made goods initially distributed overseas, because once a "first sale" has taken place, the copyright owner has no further control over a product's fate. Justice Stevens wrote the opinion, Quality King Distributors v. L'Anza Research International, No. 96-1470.
In an important interpretation of the Federal Superfund law on environmental cleanups, the Court ruled unanimously that corporations cannot ordinarily be held responsible for cleaning up the pollution caused by activities of their subsidiaries. The Court said in an opinion by Justice Souter, however, that the parent corporation can be liable if it has directly operated, as opposed to merely supervised, the subsidiary's facility. The case was United States v. Bestfoods, No. 97-454.
 
Property
The Court ruled 5 to 4 that interest on the money that clients leave on deposit for short periods with their lawyers is the property of the clients. While this was only a preliminary ruling, it cast in doubt the future of a program, adopted by all 50 states, that generates some $100 million a year for legal services for the poor from the interest on pooled small client accounts.
By definition, the individual deposits would be too small to earn net interest after the expenses of setting up the accounts under the program known as Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts, or Iolta. Nonetheless, Chief Justice Rehnquist said in his majority opinion, "interest follows principal," and the interest must be considered the clients' property even if, as a practical matter, no interest would otherwise exist. Now the lower courts must decide whether the programs amount to an unconstitutional "taking" of the private property. Justices Scalia, Thomas, O'Connor and Kennedy joined the majority opinion, Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation, No. 96-1578.
The Court struck down a 1992 law that required companies previously in the coal mining business to assume retroactive liability for health benefits for miners and their families. A plurality of four Justices, in an opinion by Justice O'Connor, said the Coal Act amounted to an unconstitutional taking of the companies' property. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas joined that opinion. Justice Kennedy provided a fifth vote to declare the law unconstitutional on due process grounds. The case was Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, No. 97-42.
 
Boundaries
In the long-running battle of Ellis Island, the Court awarded victory to New Jersey over New York by a vote of 6 to 3. All the landfilled portion, or roughly 90 percent of the island through which some 12 million immigrants passed from 1892 to 1954, is New Jersey territory under the terms of an 1934 interstate compact, Justice Souter said in his majority opinion. Justices Stevens, Scalia, and Thomas dissented. The decision, New Jersey v. New York, No. 120 original, will have little practical effect because the National Park Service runs the historic sites on the 27-acre island, but the psychological impact appears to have been considerable.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: TRADE;
$1.6 Billion in Deals Can't Mask U.S. Disappointment

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Commerce Secretary William M. Daley and Zeng Peiyan, chairman of the China State Planning Commission, gathered yesterday with American and Chinese executives in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing to announce $1.6 billion worth of new trade and investment deals between the two countries.
While both sides tried to put the best face on a ceremony that has become a staple of Chinese summit meetings with almost any Western power, it was hard for the Americans to mask their disappointment. 
 American companies like Boeing came away with far less than they had expected even a few months ago. Many of the deals announced yesterday were given inflated values or were the same ones announced last fall, when President Jiang Zemin of China visited Washington.
Executives who hoped that the summit meeting might help pry open China's vast market to American insurance companies and banks came away empty-handed.
The poor showing is a result of the faltering Asian economy and White House sensitivity to contentions that it helped American aerospace companies conduct business in China in exchange for campaign contributions.
The visit occurs when the United States trade deficit with China is running at the rate of $1 billion a week.
The deficit has soared 20 percent this year compared to 1997 and is heading toward a record $60 billion, according to Administration officials.
In past trips abroad, President Clinton has been a major booster of American business, inviting executives to travel with him and paying visits to American factories abroad.
But Mr. Clinton's trip to China has been noticeable for his conspicuous lack of attention to American commercial interests.
No executives accompanied Mr. Clinton to China, and he dropped plans to visit a General Motors plant in Beijing and a Lucent Technologies factory in Shanghai.
An Administration official who insisted on anonymity said the White House felt vulnerable to accusations that business interests were driving its "engagement" policy with China.
At the signing ceremony, Mr. Daley hailed the agreements as a boon to relations and said they would reduce the trade deficit and "significantly encourage China's efforts at social and economic reform."
He placed the total value of the 11 deals, which included companies like Cargill, I.B.M. and Lucent, at $3.3 billion.
That includes an estimated $1.7 billion for a contract to explore for methane signed by the Atlantic Richfield Company that appears to be highly speculative. The company said it would spend $60 million to drill three test wells over the next three years. If the wells prove viable -- a risky assumption in the energy business -- then the life of the contract might be worth $1.7 billion.
The General Electric Company concluded a contract worth $160 million to supply two 660-megawatt steam turbines to a power plant in Shandong Province.
A memorandum of understanding to supply those turbines was signed on Mr. Jiang's trip to Washington.
The Boeing Company received an order for 10 737 jetliners, worth an estimated $400 million. Two months ago Boeing executives were hopeful that China would buy 50 jets, the same number that Beijing ordered when Mr. Jiang was in Washington.
In recent years Boeing has been a good barometer of the state of relations between Washington and Beijing. Much of the company's expected airplane sales over the next 20 years depend on China.
When tension was high between the two countries in 1995 and 1996, China placed two orders of 30 planes each with Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that is Boeing's archrival.
Now relations between Beijing and Washington are the warmest that they have been in years, but air travel in China has plunged this year because of the weakened Asian economies.
Collectively, Chinese airlines have totaled more than $200 million in losses.
"We would have liked them to order a lot of airplanes but we also understand the situation they are in right now," a spokeswoman for Boeing in Beijing, Marta Newhart, said. "A lot of the airlines in China are not doing so well."

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE OVERVIEW;
President Arrives in Shanghai; Focuses on Talk With Citizens

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Tuesday, June 30

 BODY:
With the heavily political, issue-laden leg of his China trip now behind him, President Clinton and his entourage came to the country's largest and most cosmopolitan city Monday evening. To put his finger on the vibrant pulse of modern China, his aides said, Mr. Clinton will spend two days and three nights here talking to regular people.
Driving down the winding avenues of neon that advertise a distinctly commercial sensibility in Shanghai, his motorcade went from the airport to Shanghai's thriving waterfront, the visual centerpiece of any tour of this mega-city of 14 million. 
 A meeting this morning with entreprenuers, community leaders and homeowners in Shanghai was meant to accent the dynamic, fast-growing economic side of China, though it veered off into other topics from the law to religion. President Clinton assembled seven "agents of change" for a roundtable discussion at the Shanghai Library.
"Everyone understands there is a new China that is more prosperous, more open and more dynamic," Mr. Clinton said. "The purpose here is to help me and my wife and the American people understand the changes that are going on in modern China and the challenges that are out there and what all of your are doing in your lives to deal with those changes."
The group included a law professor, a consumer advocate, a physicist, an economist and a bishop who spent years in prison. Unlike two earlier addresses by President Clinton in China, this event was not carried live on Chinese television.
The bishop, Jin Luxian, who is attached to a Chinese Catholic church that is independent of the Vatican, appeared to surprise the President with the declaration that he did not think "belief in religion" was "restricted in any way" in China.
Bishop Jin also said his church cooperated with the Government. "Why should church believers do something against our Government?" he asked. "Here we adopted the policy of dialogue instead of contending with each other."
Mr. Clinton, who gave lengthy responses to many of the questions, had no reply to Bishop Jin.
Zhu Lanye, deputy dean of the international department at the East China University of Politics and Law, told the President that the state of the legal profession in China remained primitive but had improved. Mrs. Zhu, who is in her 40's, said China needed to train thousands more lawyers and persuade people to seek legal remedies to their grievances with the Government or in the private economy.
Wang Xiaoying, 51, a novelist, said she had little trouble getting her novels about family life published. "Personally, I have signed a contract to publish with three publishing houses," she said. "The problem is not getting novels published but coming up with good ideas each day."
Mrs. Wang asked the President whether literature played an important role in American life, and in his.
"Very much," the President replied, "and I think not only for enjoyment, but also for enlightenment. We have many books of literature, all kinds of prose and poetry published in America every year, and it is heavily taught in our schools and, at least in our case, widely discussed in our home with our daughter."
To address ordinary Chinese, President Clinton was also the host on a live radio call-in program.
As he stepped out of his limousine at the Portman Ritz-Carlton Hotel late Monday, on a busy street lined with crowds of people craning their necks for a glimpse, Mr. Clinton waved to acknowledge the cheer.
Then he went inside for the evening, passing up the chance to peek at Shanghai's boisterous night life at any of the bars and supper clubs that self-consciously fashion themselves after the styles set in the 1920's and 30's, when Shanghai was the most cosmopolitan city in Asia.
On Mr. Clinton's daytime itinerary are three landmarks that have opened in just the last two years: a stock exchange that is a leader technologically, a world-class museum with inventive display techniques and China's most modern library.
Mr. Clinton's aides have portrayed his itinerary as one that traces China's history. In Xian, the first stop, one sees relics of ancient China; in Beijing, the largest icons of Communist China are on view; Shanghai is clearly the most forward-looking city in the country. Of course, that neat description does not account for Guilin, the pleasure spot, or Hong Kong, which both lie ahead.
"In many ways, Shanghai is the future of China," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman. "The changes that are taking place in China are reflected in the very dynamic growth, economically, and the changes taking place in South China."
To Shanghai residents, actually, the rate of economic growth is palpably slowing. The real estate boom of the mid-1990's has now created a bubble of supply that seems poised to burst but has not done so yet.
In comparison with much of the rest of Asia, however, Shanghai looks healthy. Round-the-clock construction continues on skyscrapers throughout the city, if on fewer than before. The unemployment rate is rising steadily, as state-owned factories downsize, yet average family income is still climbing marginally.
There are relatively few formal events planned during Mr. Clinton's stay here, and officials doing advance work say that offers the Clinton family the flexibility for shopping and walks, or quiet time away from their 1,000-member entourage.
Tuesday's itinerary includes only three events, leaving almost the entire afternoon free for something unscripted. Wednesday's plans are almost as relaxed. On Monday, after speaking at Beijing University, the Clintons took it easy. They stayed in, at Diaoyutai Guest House, playing cards and board games, Mr. McCurry said.
Hillary Rodham Clinton also has a handful of nonofficial visits planned in Shanghai. To combine her interest in health care and children's welfare, she is to visit the Shanghai Children's Medical Center, a new hospital built by Project Hope, an American-based foundation, and Shanghai's Second Medical University. It is the first hospital in China devoted to treating children, and it was created by nongovernmental entities.
"This was not in any five-year plan," said William B. Walsh, president and chief executive of Project Hope, which has been active in China since 1983, training and advising medical workers in public health. "It reflects the kind of volunteerism that is starting to grow in China today."
It has also helped, Mr. Walsh said, that two of Shanghai's former leaders who welcomed Project Hope here were later promoted to the nation's top posts: President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
Mrs. Clinton also plans to visit a women's education and training center and the Shanghai No. 3 Girls' School. On Wednesday she will visit the Ohel Rachel Synagogue, originally built for Jews who lived in Shanghai before the Communist-led army arrived in 1949.
Mrs. Clinton also joined her husband at the roundtable discussion today at the Shanghai Library, entitled "Shaping China for the 21st Century," which highlighted the way an information-driven age will affect all countries.
