HEADLINE: University of California President Says He Will Resign Next Year 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA WHITAKER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
The president of the University of California system, Richard C. Atkinson, who sought changes in college admissions tests, announced today that he would retire on Oct. 1. 
 Dr. Atkinson, 73, has been president of the university for seven years. He had been chancellor of the University of California at San Diego for 15 years before heading the sprawling system. A cognitive scientist, Dr. Atkinson was formerly director of the National Science Foundation in Washington. 
"I think I'm due to step down," he said, "and this is the perfect time to do it." 
This year, the College Board announced that it would revamp its primary college entrance examination, the SAT I, a move viewed as a direct response to Dr. Atkinson's effort to replace it with a test that would more directly reflect what students had learned in high school.
Under Dr. Atkinson, the university system grappled with budgets and ending affirmative action. He started in the position just as the Board of Regents adopted a resolution that eliminated consideration of race and ethnicity in admissions. That change led to declining numbers of minority students.
In recent years, the numbers have begun to rebound, as the university increased its contact programs with elementary, middle and high schools and focused on improving academic performance and college preparation. The university also expanded admissions criteria to consider when students overcome economic or educational hardships. Last year, the board rescinded the resolution, although state law continues to ban affirmative action.
A panel will be formed to conduct a nationwide search for a successor to Dr. Atkinson. Of the 17 presidents of the university system, only four held the post longer than Dr. Atkinson.
The chairman of the Regents, John J. Moores, said: "I was deeply sorry to learn of his decision to retire. But he has certainly earned it after a lifetime of contributions to education, to scientific research and to the people of the state of California."
Dr. Atkinson and his wife, Rita, plan to return to San Diego after retirement.

HEADLINE: Taiwan Imports a Made-in-U.S. Political Issue: Central Park 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Central Park has captivated New Yorkers for more than 130 years, but now it has become the subject of daily debate in an unlikely venue: the mayoral race here in Taiwan's capital.
 Lee Ying-yuan, the challenger for the mayor's office, wants to raze this city's downtown airport for domestic flights and replace it with what he describes as an imitation of Central Park, complete with a surrounding ring of luxury apartment buildings. 
 Ma Ying-jeou, the popular incumbent, has a different vision as he campaigns before the vote on Dec. 7. He wants airlines to offer nonstop flights from the airport to Shanghai, an 80-minute flight that would make day trips to the mainland possible. 
China and Taiwan have been negotiating whether to allow direct flights. Travelers between Taipei and Shanghai must currently fly south to Hong Kong or Macao, change planes there and then fly back past Taiwan to Shanghai, a six- or seven-hour trip.
Taipei residents have just a quarter of the park space per person of New York City residents, and virtually no playing fields. Closing the downtown Sungshan Domestic Airport and sending planes to the outlying Chiang Kai-shek International Airport could revive the city's economy, Mr. Lee contends, by opening the way for taller buildings, which are currently banned for air safety reasons.
Taipei's financial district, a 10-minute walk from Sungshan Airport, looks like downtown Washington, with rows of boxy buildings, all of practically the same height. "All the roofs are terrible to look at," said Mr. Lee in an interview at his campaign headquarters here today. "We don't have a skyline like Manhattan's."
Taiwan is building a high-speed rail system to whisk travelers in 90 minutes from Taipei in the north to Taiwan's other main city, Kaohsiung, near the island's southern tip. Stopping along the way in several other cities, the trains will provide an alternative for most of Sungshan Airport's passengers.
Pointing out that he worked for a securities law firm in Manhattan in the 1970's and earned a master's degree at New York University, Mr. Ma says the airport site is unsuitable for a Central Park look-alike because a river and a freeway run alongside it. 
"I played softball in Central Park, I jogged in Central Park," Mr. Ma said in an interview at City Hall today. "I know Central Park quite well, and I know this would not be a Central Park."
Underlying the debate are presidential politics and Taiwan's relations with China.
Mr. Ma is from the Nationalist Party, which favors eventual reunification with China and closer transportation ties now. Mr. Lee is from the Democratic Progressive Party, which leans toward greater independence for Taiwan, and does not want Chinese flights landing at a domestic airport instead of an international one.
Mr. Ma, who is favored to win re-election, is a likely Nationalist Party candidate to run in 2004 against President Chen Shui-bian, of the Democratic Progressive Party. Mr. Chen has campaigned heavily with Mr. Lee.
The fight is partly personal: Mr. Chen was elected Taipei's mayor in 1994, but lost his re-election bid to Mr. Ma in 1998. Only then did Mr. Chen run for president, and unexpectedly won.

HEADLINE: Takeover of Indian Point By Westchester Is Proposed 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
The Westchester County executive, Andrew J. Spano, said today that he wanted to shut down the two nuclear power plants at Indian Point by buying them, or if necessary, taking them through a condemnation process.
 Citing concerns about the safety of the plants, Mr. Spano said he was setting aside $500,000 in his proposed 2003 budget for a six-month study on acquiring the Indian Point plants in Buchanan, about 40 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, and replacing them with a new natural gas plant. He estimated the purchase and construction costs alone at $2 billion to $3 billion, at least twice the amount of the county's annual budget. 
 "We think that these plants should not have been built here in the first place, and we'd rather have them somewhere else, and we're going to pursue this attack," Mr. Spano said during a news conference at his office.
But Mr. Spano and other county officials offered few details about their proposal, except to say that the study would address a wide range of questions, including where the money would come from and whether the county would act alone or try to seek partners. Mr. Spano has said he would not raise taxes to buy the plants.
Indian Point's owner, the Entergy Corporation, said today that it was not interested in selling the nuclear plants and that it would oppose any effort to close them.
"Entergy hasn't put out a for-sale sign," said Jim Steets, an Entergy spokesman. "We'll talk to the county executive about whatever he wants, but we're not looking to sell Indian Point. It's too valuable to Entergy and to the residents of New York State."
The company bought the plants in the last two years, and Mr. Steets said it had spent hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade equipment and increase training. Together, the two plants generate about 2,000 megawatts of electricity for homes, businesses and public buildings in Westchester and New York City; one megawatt is enough to power about 1,000 average homes.
Mr. Spano's announcement follows more than a year of divisive public debates here over the safety of Indian Point since the Sept. 11 terror attacks. The Westchester Board of Legislators and dozens of villages and towns across the county have passed resolutions calling for the nuclear plants to be decommissioned.
Brian Nickerson, director of the Michaelian Institute for Public Policy at Pace University, said that while Mr. Spano was clearly responding to the concerns of his constituents, his proposal for a takeover of Indian Point faced many logistical and regulatory hurdles. "I don't know if it's completely unrealistic," he said. "But I think it's a difficult sell."
Several Westchester legislators and others questioned whether the financially strained county could afford to buy the plants, let alone build a new one. Just last month, Mr. Spano, a Democrat, proposed a 31.7 percent increase in the county's share of the property tax levy to help offset a projected gap of more than $100 million next year in the county's roughly $1 billion budget. 
"I'm not willing to sign off on Westchester County becoming Westchester Lighting Company," said Legislator George Oros, the Republican minority leader. "I think there are basic, fundamental questions that you have to address first before you commit the $500,000 for the study."
But Legislator Michael B. Kaplowitz, a Democrat, said that whether or not the county took over the nuclear plants, the proposed study would take a serious look at issues that need to be addressed.
"The economic arguments to keep it open are very powerful," he said. "And yet the reasons to close it for public safety are more compelling. This is a way to do both. You would close the nuclear side and build a natural gas plant."

HEADLINE: Profit Up 23% At Wal-Mart; Others Gain 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores, the largest retailer, reported higher fiscal third-quarter profit yesterday. Wal-Mart said that net income increased 23 percent, to $1.82 billion, or 41 cents a share, in the quarter ended Oct. 31. 
 The company, based in Bentonville, Ark., was expected to have a third-quarter profit of 40 cents, according to Thomson First Call. 
 Revenue at Wal-Mart increased 11 percent, to $58.8 billion, and sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.5 percent. Fourth-quarter revenue is expected to rise 3 to 5 percent, the chief executive, H. Lee Scott Jr., said. Food sales, which have led much of Wal-Mart's revenue increases, slowed in the quarter. 
Another big retailer, Federated Department Stores, said earnings rose to $106 million, or 54 cents a share, in the period ended Nov. 2, from $3 million, or 2 cents, a year earlier. Federated, which owns Macy's and Bloomingdale's, among others, said profit was helped by a gain of $31 million from the sale of some catalog businesses. It has also reduced debt and expenses amid concern that traffic may slow. 
Excluding the sale of the businesses, Federated would have earned 38 cents. On that basis, profit was 1 cent more than the First Call estimate. 
Sales rose less than 1 percent, to $3.48 billion, and sales at stores open at least a year fell 2 percent. Those sales are expected to fall as much as 2 percent in the fourth quarter and as much as 2.5 percent in November and December combined. 
Tiffany & Company said yesterday that its fiscal third-quarter profit rose to $35.2 million, or 24 cents a share, from $24 million, or 16 cents, a year earlier. Tiffany cited cost controls and a one-time tax benefit. Revenue rose 9.9 percent, to $366 million. It said partnerships with diamond-mining companies had helped cut costs. Tiffany reduced its fourth-quarter profit and sales forecast, attributing this to slower American economic recovery than expected.

E-Mail Ties Analyst's Switch To Nursery School Spots
Jack B. Grubman, a former star telecommunications analyst, told a friend last year that his boss, Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Citigroup, helped to secure spots in an exclusive Manhattan nursery school for Mr. Grubman's daughters after he began recommending that investors buy AT&T stock. Citigroup acknowledged Mr. Weill's attempt to help Mr. Grubman's children, but denied it was connected to the analyst's upgrade of AT&T.
 The circumstances surrounding Mr. Grubman's abrupt change in the fall of 1999 to an upbeat view on AT&T from a negative one have come under scrutiny as investigators try to assess whether research practices at the Salomon Smith Barney unit were corrupted by its investment banking relationships with corporations or desired relationships.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
In Need of Help Herself, But Still Helping Others

BYLINE:  By ARTHUR BOVINO 

 BODY:
To Ana Rodriguez, the instinct to help others is like a light switch that cannot be turned off.
 And a call for help? That's something she cannot ignore, no matter how dire her own situation might be. 
 So when she heard a distress call from somewhere down the hallway at the Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan, where she was recuperating from surgery, Ms. Rodriguez didn't have to think twice. She slipped out of her bed and went to see what she could do. 
"I hear them calling and go in the hall and the nurse asked me where I was going," Ms. Rodriguez recalled. "Just for a walk. I go in the room and the man said, 'Help!' I say, 'What you need help for?' He say his diaper need changing."
Then, Ms. Rodriguez pulled out her identification as a longtime home health care attendant: " 'Roll over,' I tell him. 'I do it.' "
Since Ms. Rodriguez, 50, arrived in the United States from the Dominican Republic in 1978, she has held many jobs: sewing, preparing airline food, making caps for milk bottles.
The jobs kept her blissfully busy while her husband was working. But she also wanted to do more with her life. So she took training courses and became a home attendant. From 1985 until last year, she offered care and comfort to scores of sick and elderly people in New York City, often providing round-the-clock, live-in service.
"God gave me life for some reason," she explained in her native Spanish. "So I help people."
Now Ms. Rodriguez can use some help herself. She is waging a battle with cancer, complicated by other illness and injury. Even so, nothing -- not cancer, not hospitalizations, not financial straits -- has dampened her passion for living life fully, or for helping others do the same.
In December, Ms. Rodriguez was coughing and losing weight. At first, her doctor thought she might have tuberculosis and prescribed medication accordingly. The medicine helped, but in January she became sick again and was hospitalized. The doctor did exploratory surgery and removed a spot on her lung. Weeks later, she found out she had cancer.
In the months since then, she has been unable to work because of problems breathing. To complicate matters, during tests done in January before her surgery she was told that she had osteoporosis, and has to walk with a cane.
Most daunting for her and her family is her doctor's prognosis that she may have only two years to live.
For Ms. Rodriguez's two children -- a son, Edward, 23, and daughter, Dayanara, 20 -- it's hard to imagine a life devoid of their mother's strong and vital presence. They describe her as a vibrant woman who danced and sang for them when they were little.
Even after she became ill, her energy and compassion did not flag, they said.
"At the hospital she'd go around opening the juice boxes for people and even picking up the phones," her daughter said.
Staying strong and upbeat was far from easy. Ms. Rodriguez lost 65 pounds, and chemotherapy made her lose her hair. Her son took her illness particularly hard.
Ms. Rodriguez's treatments were covered by Medicaid, but without work she began falling behind on rent and utility bills. Ever since she came to New York, she has lived in the same apartment in Hollis, Queens. In 1978 the rent was $269; now it is $536.51 -- low compared with neighboring units, but an imposing sum to a woman who is gravely ill and unemployed.
Ms. Rodriguez has no other relatives in New York. She and her husband, who were married in 1978, separated in 1993 and divorced three years ago. He sends $100 to Dayanara every two weeks. She gives it to her mother for the rent.
In April, a neighbor referred Ms. Rodriguez to the Catholic Charities of Brooklyn and Queens, one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
"At that time she really looked sick," said Rosa Orihuela, Ms. Rodriguez's caseworker. "I said, 'We need to help her.' She's such a great lady and she really needs the help."
Ms. Rodriguez began receiving $591 a month of temporary Social Security in September 2001, but it ended in June. Using $1,073.02 from Neediest Cases, Ms. Rodriguez was able to pay her rent in April and July and stay in her home. She has applied for disability, and is also trying to get Section 8 status to lower her rent.
"I'm very grateful," Ms. Rodriguez said, "not just because Catholic Charities helped me, but because it's here for other people."
Meanwhile, other uncertainties linger. The doctors tell Ms. Rodriguez that she is doing better than expected, but they have not changed their prognosis.
Ms. Rodriguez knows the value of a laugh. In the spirit of helping, she tries to leave others chuckling whenever she can.
When she last visited Catholic Charities she talked to those around her about life's problems.
"I tell them, 'I have this amount of time to live,' " she said with a grin. " 'What, are we going to think about dying? Maybe you'll die before I do. We won't think about it. What's the point? We have to laugh.' "
And they did.

HEADLINE: Bishops Take No Action on Calls for Audit 

BYLINE:  By SAM DILLON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
The American Roman Catholic bishops ended a discussion of financial issues today that included approval of a $53 million budget for 2003 but did not address calls by Catholic philanthropists for a nationwide audit detailing how much the crisis of sexual abuse by priests has cost the church.
 The lack of a hearing on a proposed audit at the bishops' semiannual meeting angered lay leaders who have called for increased financial accountability, and it especially stung Erica John, an heiress to the Miller brewing fortune, whose donations were used secretly to pay $450,000 to a man who accused the Milwaukee archbishop of sexual assault. 
 "We are the church, and the leaders to whom we entrust our religious patrimony are failing us," Ms. John said today in an interview. "We as funders think it's important that the bishops open their books and come clean, because some of us are beginning to feel disappointed and even alienated from the church." 
With their adoption today of revised policies for dealing with abusive priests, the bishops hoped to move beyond the crisis that has undermined parishioners' confidence. But several prominent Catholics from both the church's liberal and conservative wings said that until the bishops spelled out the financial costs of the crisis they would not regain the trust of many parishioners.
In June, a group that represents 50 wealthy Catholic donors, including Ms. John, wrote to Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, the president of United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, asking the conference to hire an outside auditor to survey the money paid by the nation's 194 dioceses over two decades for abuse settlements, lawyers' fees and other costs resulting from sexual misconduct by clergymen. The group argued that reports of hush money and other secret payments had alarmed contributors and that the audit was needed to restore trust.
The Archdiocese of Boston and a few other dioceses have acknowledged financial problems because of reduced giving by parishioners, yet because diocesan finances are kept secret by many bishops, the severity of the church's financial difficulties remains unclear.
Bishop Gregory, a proponent of increased financial disclosure who reported in May that his Southern Illinois diocese of Belleville had paid $2.8 million over nine years to cover the costs of sexual abuse by clergymen, forwarded the proposal to two committees within the bishops conference for consideration, said Francis J. Butler, president of the donors' group, Foundations and Donors Interested in Catholic Activities.
In recent months the proposal gained the backing of several nationwide lay groups and of prominent Catholics. But it was never mentioned in the bishops' public deliberations here this week.
At a news conference concluding today's session, Bishop Gregory was asked whether he was concerned that the church was heading for financial difficulties because parishioners were upset about the crisis and might reduce their donations.
"Trust is only possible when we are open in our stewardship," Bishop Gregory said. In an interview this evening, Bishop Gregory said bishops had no power to compel each other to reveal diocesan finances, and he suggested that as a result the proposal for a nationwide audit was not included in the agenda. 
Earlier in the conference, Bishop Joseph A. Galante, the coadjutor of Dallas who is chairman of the conference's communications committee, said he could not explain why the proposed financial survey went undiscussed.
"I don't know, I guess it didn't get put on the agenda," Bishop Galante said.
Kenneth W. Korotky, the chief financial officer for the bishops conference, said bishops were providing more detailed financial reports to parishioners than in the past.
"Each diocese stands alone, and we cannot promulgate rules on financial accountability," Mr. Korotky said in an interview here. "But from what I've seen, the bishop's reports are offering more information. The trend is toward more openness." 
Charles Zech, a professor of economics at Villanova University who studies church finance, said that some dioceses, like Chicago, issued fairly thorough annual reports, "but most dioceses resist giving out any detailed financial information." 
Because Catholic parishioners often do not know how the money they put in the collection plate is spent, they donate a smaller part of their income to their church, about 1 percent on average, than do most Protestants, Mr. Zech said. Southern Baptists, for instance, donate more than 3 percent of their income to their church.
"There's a clear relationship," he said. "Churches that do a better job of telling people where their money is going get more donations."
The bishops do demand financial data from their conference, which distributed budget documents this week that were quite detailed, and included an accounting of how much each diocese would contribute to the conference's $53 million budget for 2003.
The Archdiocese of Chicago will contribute the most, $412,000, and New York will be second, contributing $405,000. The Diocese of Brooklyn will contribute $165,000 and Rockville Centre, which covers Long Island, $236,000.
The budget documents made no mention, however, of the financial difficulties in dioceses like Boston, Los Angeles and Providence, R.I., as a result of huge legal settlements and other recent costs relating to priestly misconduct. The mushrooming legal costs come as church revenues are down because the crisis has undermined parishioners' confidence that their donations will be used for charitable purposes.
Nowhere was donor confidence more damaged this year than in Milwaukee, where Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland resigned in June after acknowledging that he had paid $450,000 to a man who accused him of sexual assault. Church officials later reported that the money had come from the sale of a building donated to the church by a foundation endowed by Ms. John's family.
"If the bishops think that the laity doesn't count, that this is business as usual, then they are going to prolong the agony," Ms. John said.

HEADLINE: Visions of Jobs, or Danger, In Hudson Pipeline Project 

BYLINE:  By LISA W. FODERARO 

DATELINE: TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Nov. 13 

 BODY:
One by one, hour after hour, they approached the podium -- homeowners, village managers, school officials, environmentalists, county legislators, parents, union officials, real estate agents and State Assembly members.
 A majority of the speakers came to the daylong hearing to denounce a proposed natural gas pipeline that would cross the Hudson River and wend its way through Westchester County. The speakers identified a wide range of possible threats, from the disruption of almost half of New York City's water supply to the loss of trees and streams in a 20-acre arboretum in northern Westchester. 
 Many speakers, mostly union workers, voiced support for the gas conduit, known as the Millennium Pipeline, citing the need for jobs and for additional energy sources. 
The hearing, held in the ballroom of the Hilton Tarrytown Hotel, could prove to be the final showdown between the pipeline's critics and supporters. It was called by the United States Department of Commerce in response to an appeal by the pipeline's builder, Columbia Gas Transmission of Fairfax, Va., of a decision by New York State to block the gas line.
The proposed 425-mile gas line from Lake Erie to Westchester County has drawn fierce opposition from many residents, environmentalists and elected officials.
New York's Department of State, which must approve any changes to the Hudson River's shores, determined in May that the pipeline would hurt fragile wildlife habitats, tarnish waterfront development and threaten New York City's water supply.
Because the appeal centered on the state coastal-zone finding, many speakers addressed that issue. "The environment for me is the key," said Naomi C. Matusow, a state assemblywoman who represents northeastern Westchester. "Haverstraw Bay is one of the most biologically productive areas in the Hudson. It is a hatchery and a fishery and has regional and national importance."
But organizers of the hearing permitted far-ranging testimony. "The purpose of today is to allow people to talk," said David P. Miller, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the agency within the Department of Commerce that is handling the appeal.
Many educators and parents from the village of Briarcliff Manor turned out to criticize the location of one section of pipeline 75 feet from a kindergarten playground.
Alicia R. Zalesin, the school board president, said that the potential placement of the pipeline near the school had "produced tremendous fear and anguish" in the community, especially given heightened fears of terrorism.
The threat of terrorism also figured prominently in testimony given by a representative of New York City's Department of Environmental Protection. Michael Meyer, a project manager with the agency's Bureau of Water Supply, explained that the pipeline would run within two feet of the Catskill Aqueduct at a critical juncture known as the Byrn Mawr Siphon.
A rupture of the siphon, caused by either a construction accident or a terrorist act after the pipeline's completion, would "trigger a violent release of an enormous volume of water," Mr. Meyer said. New York City, he said, would be "without 40 percent of its water supply."
At 7 p.m., the crowd in the ballroom overflowed into another room. Many people held signs and clapped or jeered, depending on who was speaking. An official repeatedly threatened a recess if order was not maintained.
"When I'm not working," said Bob Connolly, a member of Operating Engineers Local 825, "New York State pays me $405 a month. I have five children, and that's not enough. I can't afford to be unemployed for a year."
But Jonathan Glaser, a Croton resident, said, "Placing a high-pressured natural gas pipeline within clear range of Indian Point, the Con Ed electrical towers and the watershed is a recipe for disaster -- all for Millennium's profits."
Soon came chants of "Stop the pipeline!" and opposing chants of "Build the pipeline!" The meeting was recessed for a half-hour. When it resumed, an official said, "We have to live with each other for a while here."
In announcing the decision in May, Gov. George E. Pataki said the planned route -- across the Hudson River near Haverstraw Bay -- was inconsistent with the state's efforts to clean up the Hudson River. In recent months, the state has proposed alternative routes, but each one has elicited a torrent of negative reaction from local officials and homeowners.
The Department of Commerce, which oversees state plans for managing coastlines, will consider today's comments, along with written briefs and letters. A determination is not expected until well into next year. Whatever the finding, either side could then take the matter to court.
In September, federal regulators gave their approval to the pipeline. But among the conditions of the approval is the resolution of objections raised by New York State over the river's ecology.

HEADLINE: For a Split State Legislature, Bipartisan Fiscal Problems 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Legislative leaders poured millions of dollars into races this year to ensure that the Republican majority in the Senate and the Democratic majority in the Assembly not only retained their power but became more firmly entrenched than ever.
 It worked. The divided Legislature, known for its partisan disputes and gridlock, late budgets and general legislative paralysis, is still going strong, with the majorities in both houses growing. 
 Once again, New York has bucked the national trend. Across the nation, Republicans took over seven legislative chambers previously in Democratic hands, giving the G.O.P. for the first time since 1952 slightly more state legislative seats than Democrats, according to the National Council of State Legislatures. The Republicans now control 21 legislatures, while the Democrats have 16. 
Twelve states finished the election with split party control, but in only one, Delaware, do the ruling parties have large margins in each house. (Nebraska has a unicameral legislature.) 
Indeed, in three of those states -- Georgia, Indiana and North Carolina -- a switch of just one seat would give one party complete control.
Not so in New York -- and deliberately so. The leaders of the two houses have a 20-year tradition of drawing legislative district lines to benefit their majorities. 
The mutually agreed-upon gerrymandering, coupled with millions of dollars in campaign contributions that the leaders direct into those few races that are competitive, creates a potent machine for protecting each majority.
"This election was essentially decided in April when the majority parties of both houses rigged the redistricting process," said Blair Horner, the legislative director of the New York Public Interest Group. 
"The strategy the parties work on is that you limit the number of districts with competitive enrollments, then they drop truckloads of money into those competitive races."
The Democrats gained four Assembly seats and now have the largest majority they have ever enjoyed in the lower house. They hold 103 of the 150 seats, for the first time giving the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, the votes to override the governor's veto.
The Senate Republicans also gained a seat in southern Brooklyn, after spending more than $1.5 million to oust the Democratic incumbent. They also picked up a formerly Democratic seat outside Rochester.
That gives the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, and his party 37 of the 62 Senate seats, which equals the largest majorities the Republicans have enjoyed in 30 years.
The split could have even more ominous consequences than usual this year, given the urgent agenda ahead. The state has not passed a budget on time in 19 years and has had difficulty compromising on important legislation.
This year, the Legislature will face the worst fiscal crisis in a generation: a budget shortfall of at least $5 billion, a bleak economic outlook, few reserves and the equally dire plight of New York City.
"We don't have enough resources to satisfy everyone's desire," Mr. Bruno said.
The legislative leaders have said they hope partisan bickering will not hinder reaching an agreement with Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, on how to balance the state's books.
However, Mr. Silver made it clear that he believed that, given the election results, the key to successful budget talks would be for "the Senate and the governor to recognize we are equal partners in the operation of government."
Mr. Silver also said he would resist cutting education aid or Medicaid, the two largest pieces of the $89 billion state budget. Instead, he suggested the governor should seek more aid from Washington, where his party controls both houses of Congress and the presidency.
For his part, Mr. Bruno said he doubted that the dynamics between the two houses would change. He said the key to smooth budget talks would be for Mr. Silver to drop his past insistence that the governor promise not to veto changes the Legislature makes to the spending plan, a stance Mr. Silver is unlikely to alter.
"If he plays that game or negotiates that way, then the dynamics can't change," Senator Bruno said. "It can't be sort of drawing lines in the sand."
Neither man is in danger of a revolt within his house. The vast majority of the 189 incumbents who ran were re-elected, with only six losing to challengers in either the primary or the general elections.
Among incumbents in the majority parties, there were even fewer losses.
Only one Democratic incumbent in the Assembly, Naomi Matusow, of Mount Kisco, was defeated, and that was in the primary to another Democrat, Adam Bradley, who went on to win her seat. Senator Pedro Espada, a Democrat who earlier this year pledged his allegiance to the Republicans, was defeated. 
That is not say the election was without surprises and oddities. In southern Westchester County, the incumbent assemblyman, Ronald C. Tocci, lost the Democratic primary to Noam Bramson, went on to run in the general election as a Republican and won. But he will rejoin the Democratic majority when he returns to Albany.
For the first time in modern history, Manhattan's Upper East Side has no Republican representatives in Albany, as Democrats took two open seats that have long been held by liberal Republicans.
Jonathan L. Bing, a Democrat, narrowly defeated Gail Hilson to win John Ravitz's old seat. Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat, hung on to defeat Andrew S. Eristoff in the fight for Roy M. Goodman's old seat.
Mr. Silver spent lavishly to help elect Democrats upstate. In all, his Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee spent at least $1.4 million in the last month of campaigning to protect its incumbents and challenge a few vulnerable Republicans. 
Senator Bruno's New York Senate Republican Campaign Committee went through at least $3.7 million in that time and picked up several new members upstate, too.
But the sweetest victory for the Republicans was in southern Brooklyn, where Martin J. Golden, a former Republican City Council member, defeated Senator Vincent J. Gentile, a Democrat who held onto the seat for six years, even though it has historically been Republican.
Mr. Golden was helped by Mr. Pataki and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who stumped with him. Senator Bruno funneled at least $1.5 million into his campaign.
Both leaders said the election results had given their party a mandate, which does not bode well for bipartisan cooperation. Senator Bruno saw in the national vote tallies a ringing endorsement of Republican policies, like lower taxes and tighter security measures to fight terrorism.
"What I saw was that people's priorities in the majority are more in tune with what the Republicans have stood for and have been espousing, starting with homeland security," he said.
Mr. Silver saw the election differently, saying, "I think we have clearly staked our claim that all the Republicans' messages haven't worked, that we are a viable part of state government."

HEADLINE: Auction Season's Finale Sets Records for 6 Artists 

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
Great American masters like Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and Barnett Newman fueled the week's final and most buoyant evening sale of postwar and contemporary art. Collectors, dealers and curiosity-seekers packed Christie's Rockefeller Center salesroom beyond capacity last night, and records were set for six artists.
 "Bidding was fast and furious," said a triumphant Christopher Burge, honorary chairman of Christie's in America and the evening's auctioneer. "It was a very very strong sale right across the board." 
 Of the 75 works on offer, only 13 failed to sell. The auction totaled $66.9 million, above its $60 million low estimate.
"Estimates played a large part in the outcome," said Susan Dunne, a dealer at PaceWildenstein. One reason for last night's success was that Christie's didn't inflate what it thought the market would pay, dealers said. And while Sotheby's sale on Tuesday night brought a higher total -- $78.2 million -- it might have done much better if the estimates had been less ambitious.
At Christie's, a Jasper Johns was the evening's biggest seller: "0 Through 9" (1961), a superimposition of the numerals in a range of grays. Estimated at $6 million to $8 million, it attracted three serious bidders. In the end, there was a valiantly fought war between a telephone bidder and Andrew Fabricant, who runs the Richard Gray Gallery in New York. The telephone bidder won, with $9.9 million. The price seemed low, considering that the Whitney Museum of American Art recently acquired a similar Johns, though in color, for a reported $15 million. The painting sold last night had been in several respected collections, including that of the publishing magnate S. I. Newhouse Jr.
After the sale, rumors about the buyer's identity began circulating. Many experts believed it was David Geffen, competing against Leslie Wexner, the retailer for whom Mr. Fabricant was said to be bidding.
The Johns was one of nine works being sold by the Israel Phoenix Assurance Company, which owns one of the few corporate collections in Israel, formed by Joseph Hackmey, the company's former managing director. The collection was estimated at $14.2 million to $20 million. Rather than give the corporation a guarantee, an undisclosed minimum sum regardless of the sale's outcome, Christie's had bought the nine works outright.
(Final prices include Christie's commission: 19.5 percent on the first $100,000 and 10 percent on the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
Another much-desired painting last night was Lichtenstein's "Happy Tears" (1964). Two bidders competed for the painting, which ended up selling for $7.1 million, just above its high estimate, $7 million, and a record for the artist.
The image, a close-up of a woman with flaming-red hair holding her head in her hands and crying with a big smile on her face, was being sold by Robert and Janet Kardon. He is a retired industrialist from Philadelphia; she is the former director of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia and the American Craft Museum in Manhattan. Christie's had given the Kardons a guarantee that experts say was $6 million. It was a risk worth taking.
Another Pop painting brought more than its high estimate. Six bidders wanted to take home Warhol's "Big Electric Chair" (1967), an image from one of the artist's famous series, this one with a hot pink background. The painting finally sold to Philippe Segalot, a private Manhattan dealer, for $4.9 million, nicely above its $4 million high estimate. The painting was being sold by Francois Pinault, the French luxury goods magnate who owns Christie's. He could be spotted in a skybox above Christie's salesroom, looking down on all the bidding.
Not all Warhols did so well. "Camouflage Last Supper," a 1986 image in bright red and pink that was being sold by the San Francisco collectors Kent and Vicki Logan, was expected to bring $1.5 million to $2 million, but there wasn't a bid in sight.
Perhaps the rarest painting was Barnett Newman's "White Fire I" (1954), the first major Newman on the market since Christie's sold "The Word II," from the same year, for $3 million, a record for the artist, in 1995. That record was broken last night when an unidentified telephone bidder was willing to pay $3.8 million, just below its $4 million low estimate. The painting consists of an aqua background punctuated by two zips, as the artist called them: a wide pale beige band on the left and a bleeding blue stripe on the right. Not only had it been in the recent Newman retrospective at the Philadelphia Museum of Art this year, but it had also hung on the walls of the Tate Modern until two weeks ago, when it was brought from London for the sale. (The Tate hopes the new owner will let it go back to the exhibition, which closes on Jan 5.)
The Newman came from the Israel Phoenix Assurance Company. So did an untitled 1967 work by Eva Hesse. Fashioned from sculpt-metal over steel washers and wood, it was estimated at $300,000 to $400,000. Two telephone bidders tried to buy the piece, which brought $405,500.
Years ago there was no appetite whatsoever for Color Field artists, but that is changing. Last night five bidders went for an untitled Morris Louis painting from 1959-60 that was estimated at $700,000 to $900,000. An unidentified buyer snapped it up for $1.6 million, a record for the artist.
Alexander Calder's work seems to perform well in any economic climate. Last night, his "S-Shaped Vine," a (1946), a hanging mobile made of black sheet metal and wire, brought $2.5 million. The buyer was Larry Gagosian, the Manhattan dealer, who was willing to reach far beyond the $1.6 million high estimate.
Amy Cappellazzo, who heads Christie's contemporary-art department in New York, said she thought the reason for last night's consistently strong prices was that the sale was commercial and "just what the market wanted": Pop Art and top examples of classic contemporary artists.

HEADLINE: Coral Reefs Off the Florida Keys Get Protection From Large Ships 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Coral reefs off the Florida Keys, part of the world's third-largest barrier reef ecosystem, will be protected from damage by large ships under a new international agreement, the Bush administration said today.
 The body of water stretching from Biscayne National Park to the Tortugas, 3,000 square nautical miles, is the first area designated in the United States to protect the reefs from anchoring, grounding and collisions from passing ships, officials from the Commerce Department said. 
 The protected region, in the Florida Straits, includes the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, which Congress and President George Bush created in 1990. 
Starting on Dec. 1, captains of ships longer than 164 feet will have to avoid certain areas in the protected zone and will be prohibited from anchoring in some other places. Nautical charts produced throughout the world will show the protected zone and reflect its requirements. Violators will face fines up to $100,000 per violation per day.
Samuel W. Bodman, deputy commerce secretary, called the agreement a triumph of cooperation between federal officials, the shipping industry and the International Maritime Organization, a United Nations group that regulates the shipping industry.
"This rare international form of protection now awarded to fragile Florida Keys coral reefs is an example of how federal resource managers can work closely with industry to protect vulnerable natural resources while simultaneously supporting shipping and economic growth," Mr. Bodman said. "Both ship trade and the tourism tied to the Keys coral reefs have vital economic significance to the state and region."
The proposal has been supported by the Coast Guard, the State Department and environmental groups in Florida. 
More than 40 percent of the world's commerce passes through the Florida Straits each year, officials said. Ships have damaged the reef ecosystem through anchoring, groundings, collisions and the discharge of harmful substances. Ten large ships have grounded in the now-protected zone since 1984.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has said coral reefs are threatened by pollution, overfishing and coastal development. A study on the health of 7,600 square miles of coral reefs within waters controlled by the United States and its territories, released last month by the agency, found that global warming also caused significant long-term damage to the reefs.
There are four other protected areas like the one announced today: the Great Barrier Reef off Australia; the Sabana-Camaguey Archipelago in Cuba; Malpelo Island in Colombia; and the Wadden Zee in the Netherlands .

CORRECTION-DATE: November 16, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about an international agreement to protect coral reefs in the Florida Straits from damage by large ships cited an incorrect figure from the Department of Commerce on the amount of cargo that passes through the straits each year. It is 40 percent of the world's shipping commerce, not of all commerce.

HEADLINE: Bush Administration Halts Payments to Send Oil to North Korea 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said today that it would stop financing monthly shipments of fuel oil to North Korea, which are required under a 1994 arms control agreement, to punish North Korea for pursuing a covert nuclear weapons program.
 But the White House, in a bow to its closest Pacific allies, Japan and South Korea, said it would not demand that a tanker carrying this month's shipment of 42,500 metric tons of oil turn around before reaching North Korea. The ship is just days from port, officials said. 
 The compromise decision, made by President Bush during a meeting of the National Security Council today, underscores the administration's desire to maintain a united front with its allies in pressing North Korea to abandon its nuclear program, administration officials said.
Japan and South Korea have resisted the administration's urgings to cut ties to North Korea, arguing that engagement is the best way to change its behavior.
The administration will make its case against future fuel shipments at a meeting of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization in New York on Thursday.
Japan, South Korea and the European Union also sit on the organization's board. Though the organization operates on a consensus basis, the United States carries a powerful bargaining chip: it pays for almost all of the oil costs, which amounted to $86 million in the last fiscal year.
The energy organization does not have enough money to buy the December shipment, officials said. While South Korea or Japan could foot the December bill, they are expected to adopt the United States' position opposing future shipments, at least temporarily, American and Asian diplomats said.
"One of our goals here has been to present North Korea with a united front," a senior administration official said. "We are interested in maintaining that consensus when we come out of that meeting."
But the future of that consensus remains in doubt. Should the standoff continue deep into the frigid Korean winter, pressure may grow in South Korea to resume oil shipments. Some officials in the Bush administration also want to preserve elements of the 1994 agreement, though more hard-line officials contend that it should be scrapped.
The 1994 agreement called on North Korea to freeze and then dismantle its nuclear weapons program in exchange for help in building two light-water nuclear reactors and for the annual delivery of 500,000 metric tons of fuel oil. North Korea admitted last month that it had violated the pact by developing a program to enrich uranium for nuclear bombs.
The president's decision on future shipments was praised by a number of lawmakers in Congress, although some urged him to take an even harder line.
"I'm pleased to hear that the Bush administration isn't going to fund further fuel oil shipments to North Korea," said Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who is co-chairman of the Bipartisan Congressional Task Force on Nonproliferation.
"But if all the Bush administration does is step aside and let the South Koreans or the Japanese pick up the tab," he said, "it hasn't really accomplished very much. The most important thing the president could do right now is to announce today that the United States will not support the continued construction of two light-water reactors."

HEADLINE: Democrats Select Boston for 2004 Convention 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
As cities go, Boston has had its share of recent chips on its shoulder. 
 The Big Dig, the endlessly expensive endeavor to bury bulky highways underground, has been a mammoth eyesore and a national joke. Race relations were a mess in a city where the battleground of busing still smoldered. Business in the bassinet of American history was not exactly booming. 
 But today the city received word that at least some of those legacies have lifted, as the Democratic National Committee declared that Boston would be the site of its 2004 convention. The decision gave the city its first national political convention and provided a major salve to its ego. 
After five years of angling for the convention and being slapped down in its bid for the 2000 event, Boston beat out Miami (it would have been hurricane season), Detroit (which lacked the hotel rooms) and, especially, New York, the other leading contender. But New York rejected the demand to drop its desire to be host to the Republican convention, too. 
In Boston today, it was pretty much impossible to find a skeptic to play down the significance of the victory. 
"It's huge," Thomas Piper, an urban-planning research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said. "It's a sign that Boston is a heads-up place. And it's a sign that there is something called the 21st century. People forget that this is a place where people often can't come together. But this suggests that there may be a future out there." 
Boston won after intensive lobbying by Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Mayor Thomas M. Menino, especially their Herculean effort to prod businesses to contribute $20 million. It was the first time that a city had "put money on the table" before a convention bid was awarded, Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said.
Solid financing was considered paramount, because the Democrats were still smarting from the chaos of the 2000 convention in Los Angeles, where the city fell short of its budget and Mr. McAuliffe, then in charge of fund-raising for President Bill Clinton, was hastily named convention chairman and had to raise $11 million in a matter of weeks.
Today, Mr. McAuliffe said the Boston bid "puts us on fiscally sound footing." In addition to the business role, $17 million was pledged by federal, state and local governments, along with $12.5 million of in-kind donations from private sources.
New York convention backers were not pleased. A loyal Democratic contributor, John A. Catsimatidis, wrote to Mr. McAuliffe that New York had been "passed over in our time of need" 
"By choosing Boston over New York," Mr. Catsimatidis said, "our task of raising money for our nominee will be much harder."
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York said: "I was told they wanted to go to Boston. They'd never been there before."
Mr. McAuliffe, referring to the prospect that the Republicans might go to New York, said, "We have to do something unique with our convention in 2004." 
Democratic officials said Boston officials had convinced the party that the city had resolved many of the problems that dogged it in 2000. The Big Dig would be 85 percent complete by the start of the convention, scheduled for July 26, and any potential traffic problems would be ironed out, the city said. 
Boston officials also worked to address whether this historically racially polarized city could evoke enough positive feelings from minority groups. Its bid included appointing a "diversity director," in charge of topics like making sure that minorities are involved in convention planning and that minority contractors are amply represented in convention-related work. 
At a news conference at City Hall, Mayor Menino insisted that the city no longer deserved to be considered racially divided. "That's the old reputation of Boston," he said. 
He introduced two black legislators and the president of the local Urban League. 
"I'm black, I'm woman, I'm immigrant," said Marie P. St. Fleur, a state representative from Boston who came from Haiti. "I'm excited about the new Boston, a Boston that is inclusive."
Ms. St. Fleur added that Mr. Menino was "trying to make it the city it ought to be." 
"We're not there," she said. "But at least, we're dealing with it frankly." 
Several experts were surprised that on the heels of Nov. 5 the Democrats chose a city known as a bastion of liberalism.
"With the fact that they're not going to get one more Democratic vote out of Massachusetts than they would have otherwise, it's sort of astonishing that the party has decided to come to Boston," said Alex Krieger, chairman of the urban planning department at Harvard.
Some Democrats said emphasizing the liberal side could help the party look more assertive. Committee leaders said that was not a factor in their decision.
Having the convention here means it will be in the home state of Senator John Kerry, who will probably seek the presidential nomination. Asked whether the choice would help him because he had the potential to be the nominee, Mr. Kerry asked, "Can you share with me how great that potential may be?"
By all accounts, Mr. Kennedy's role was pivotal, going beyond fund-raising to include a presentation to the site committee in which he recited a poem based on Longfellow's "Midnight Ride of Paul Revere," accompanied by a fife and drum band. The senator also presented Mr. McAuliffe with an eight-page white paper that he asked a former columnist for The Boston Globe to write, emphasizing Boston's strengths and beginning with, "Nobody wants it like we do."
A jubilant Mr. Kennedy presented Mr. McAuliffe with a gavel made of wood from the U.S.S. Constitution, saying he could use it at the convention. Executives celebrated, saying the convention would not only provide a direct lift economically -- Mr. Menino has estimated $156 million in revenue -- but would also have ripple effects by giving a good impression of the city. 
Jack Connors, an advertising executive who was co-chairman of the Boston convention committee, said the donations by businesses like Raytheon and FleetBoston Financial were a "way for big business to demonstrate that they care about small business, restaurant owners, hotel operators." 
Sal Tecce, owner of Joe Tecce's restaurant in the North End, will be perfectly happy to accept the help. 
"It will put the city in the national spotlight," Mr. Tecce said, "and will help bring business back to Boston. He added with a hint of the old underdog image, "Or we can make a mess and no one will come back."

HEADLINE: Staring Into the Abyss 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
"We are still a city of big dreams, of big ideas, big projects and a big heart," said Michael Bloomberg in his inaugural address as mayor of New York last Jan. 1.
 It was a good line, given that it was delivered less than four months after the horror of Sept. 11, 2001. But it was weakened a bit by the fact that it came right after a line that rang obviously false in a city that was faced not only with a crisis of confidence, but with a terrible budget crisis as well. 
 "We cannot raise taxes," said Mr. Bloomberg. "We will find another way." 
I knew the mayor was wrong and I thought at the time that he was making a mistake politically. He was a fresh face at City Hall. He carried none of the baggage of his predecessors. And he had insisted throughout his campaign that he was not a typical politician. At that moment, Mike Bloomberg, of all people, was in a position to level with the public, to tell the truth. And the truth was that the budget situation was dire, so dire that there was no way to avoid increased taxes as part of the solution.
Instead, like a typical politician, Mike Bloomberg dissembled.
And he kept on dissembling. "It is exactly the wrong time to even contemplate raising taxes," he said at the end of February. "I think considering it does a disservice to New York City."
He hewed to that disingenuous line for months, until the reality could no longer be concealed from even the least discerning eye. The city is in a budget meltdown, and the state is not far behind. It's the worst fiscal crisis since the disaster of the 1970's.
The mayor's flip-flop -- he's now in favor of raising taxes -- was only part of the problem. The bigger disservice to both city and state residents was the overall refusal of Mr. Bloomberg and the other top politicians of both major parties to be candid and to work together in figuring out the most responsible ways to cope with the billions of dollars in deficits that have piled up in the city and state budgets.
Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican, should have been leading the fight on behalf of the city, working tirelessly, among other things, for whatever assistance might be secured from his fellow Republicans in Albany and Washington. The mayor was right when he insisted that severe budget cuts were inevitable. But that was never going to be enough. As the speaker of the City Council, Gifford Miller, has argued for the better part of a year, "The city cannot cut its way out of this crisis."
New York City has to close a gap that is estimated at $1 billion for the remainder of this fiscal year and $6 billion for next year. This comes at the same time that the state is facing a shortfall next year of up to $10 billion.
No new taxes? That refrain has finally been shelved, and the whole hideous constellation of service cuts and potential tax hikes is emerging for all to see. Mayor Bloomberg now seems to be moving to the opposite extreme, seeking a property tax hike of as much as 25 percent and enactment of a politically untenable income tax on commuters several times as large as the commuter tax that was scrapped a few years ago.
Calls are also going out for transit fare hikes, and tolls on the East River bridges.
We are witnessing the first stage of what may become a precipitous decline in the city's quality of life. All the tax arrows are pointing up and all the service arrows are pointing down. Hunger, homelessness and unemployment are big problems. Library hours are shrinking and resources are being carted away from a school system that was already in deep trouble.
It won't be long before sharp cuts are felt in such vital areas as police, fire and sanitation.
The city cannot arrest the decline by itself. It does not have the resources. Only a concerted effort that includes substantial help from the state and federal governments can do that. But there is no one leading such an effort.
Mayor Bloomberg spoke in January about a city of big dreams and big ideas. It was a nice sentiment. But at the moment the city is broke and its future is bleak. A galvanizing vision is needed. If the mayor has some real sense of how to get beyond this crisis that is threatening to undo the hard-won progress of the past decade, now would be a good time to disclose it.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Says He Supports Bush Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, weighed in today in favor of President Bush's campaign to make last year's tax cuts permanent, lending a powerful voice to a high priority of the new Republican Congress.
 "It would probably be unwise to unwind the long-term tax cut, because it is already built into the system," Mr. Greenspan told members of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee. 
 Mr. Greenspan refuted the Bush administration on a crucial point, however, saying that continuing the planned schedule of tax cuts would provide almost no stimulus to the economy because the move would affect taxes that kick in mostly during the second half of the decade. 
Mr. Greenspan's comments on taxes came in response to questions from lawmakers. In his earlier testimony to the committee, the Fed chairman remained cautiously optimistic on the economy, saying it seemed to be in the midst of a "soft patch" rather than a renewed downturn. The recent Fed rate cut, to 1.25 percent from 1.75 percent, he said, was primarily an "insurance premium" in case the economic troubles were worse than Fed officials generally believed.
Mr. Greenspan's support for making the tax cuts permanent is likely to make it even more difficult for those lawmakers, mostly Democrats, who argue that the planned tax cuts should be postponed or scaled back because the government is already facing years of big deficits.
While cautioning that Congress will face difficult choices down the road in bringing government spending more in line with revenues, Mr. Greenspan said that not making the tax cuts permanent would disappoint investors and make things worse.
"There are potential adverse consequences, which I don't think are desirable," he said.
At the White House, Mr. Bush insisted again today on making last year's tax cuts permanent and intimated that he might propose additional tax measures on top of that to stimulate the economy.
"I sent a signal to Congress that I believe that we need to have further discussions how to best stimulate the economy," he told reporters at a news conference today. "And I'm very serious about that."
Largely because of the economic slowdown, the downward plunge of stock markets and the initial round of tax cuts approved by Congress last year, the federal budget swung from a surplus of more than $100 billion last year to a deficit of about $159 billion this year. 
Though neither Democrats nor Republicans have any appetite for trying to balance the budget amid the gloom and uncertainty in today's economy, there is a big debate about whether to cut taxes even further in the years ahead.
The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency that analyzes the government's trends in taxes and spending, estimates that making last year's tax cuts permanent will reduce federal revenues by nearly $200 billion a year by 2012. 
Many budget experts worry that the extension of tax cuts will take hold at the same time that the aging of the baby boom generation begins to create the need for a surge in outlays for Social Security and Medicare.
Mr. Bush reiterated his view that the main reason for the new budget deficit was the faltering economy, and he argued that the best way to balance the budget was to stimulate more economic growth.
"The deficit is caused by the fact that revenues have not come in," he said. "And there's two things we can do about it: one, stimulate the economy to create more revenues; and, two, hold down spending." 
Despite repeated hints since August about proposals for additional tax cuts, the Bush administration has so far refrained from offering any specific proposals for new breaks.
Among the ideas under study are additional tax breaks for individual investors, like increasing the amount people can put into tax-deferred retirement plans; increasing the amount people can deduct on their taxes from investment losses; increasing business tax breaks for investment; and possibly reducing taxes on corporate dividends. 
"The key will be to maintain cash flow in the private sector," said Lawrence B. Lindsey, head of the White House's National Economic Council, in a speech to the United States Chamber of Commerce.
But Mr. Lindsey cautioned that Mr. Bush was still "evaluating options" and hinted at the administration's own concerns about the rising deficit. "We do not live in an environment in which we have unlimited income," he said. "It is a balancing act."
Among Republicans in Congress, support appears to be considerably stronger for cutting taxes rather than worrying about narrowing the budget deficit. "Nobody is closing the door" to tax cuts, said one Republican staff member on the House Ways and Means Committee, where tax bills originate. 
Meanwhile, one of the Senate's most forceful Republican advocates of fiscal austerity -- Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico -- let it be known today that he will step down as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to become chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. 
His successor will be Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, who has long been an advocate for tax cuts.
In his testimony today, Mr. Greenspan also expressed confidence that the United States could shoulder the costs of a war with Iraq, arguing that the economic impact would be significantly less than that of the wars in Korea and Vietnam.
Less than two weeks after the Fed cut interest rates by an unusually large half a percentage point, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that the economy was weighed down by uncertainty and "geopolitical risk" -- a euphemism for the prospects of a war with Iraq.
Mr. Greenspan said there was no evidence, "at least up to the moment," that an economic downturn was accelerating. And while saying the Federal Reserve remained ready to intervene again if the economy did deteriorate, he said the "most probable path" was one of gradual improvement and that another round of monetary stimulus would not be necessary.
But even if the economy deteriorated further, Mr. Greenspan said, he still disputed economists who worried that the Federal Reserve had exhausted its tools for fighting potential deflation in prices or was close to losing the ability to revive the economy because interest rates had reached such low levels. If need be, he said, the Federal Reserve could still stimulate activity by buying up a wide range of securities in the financial markets.

HEADLINE: House Approves Domestic Security Bill 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
The House hurriedly approved a revised domestic security bill tonight to reflect a new agreement with the White House on reducing worker protections, brushing aside Democratic objections that Republican leaders had added several provisions benefiting businesses and Republican interests.
 The bill, approved 299 to 121, would reverse an earlier measure and allow American companies that have moved offshore in order to evade taxes to contract with the Homeland Security Department. It would also extend protection against liability suits for airline screening companies and many other businesses that contract with the department, and adds a similar provision protecting the makers of smallpox vaccines. 
 Most Democrats voted against the bill, with many raising objections to the new provisions and the altering of Civil Service rules. 
The House voted 215 to 203 along party lines not to create an independent commission to investigate the Sept. 11 attacks. Several members of both parties in the two chambers said they would try to include the commission in an intelligence spending bill that has still not been passed. But Republican House leaders said the commission needed more planning, drawing complaints from relatives of attack victims that they were trying to hide failures that might have prevented the attacks.
Working to conclude the year's legislative business by week's end, the House also passed a stopgap spending measure to keep the government operating through January. Many members of both parties had hoped the House would pass at least a few of the pending appropriations bills the government uses to keep operating, but House leaders said they would take up the bills once the new Congress convened next year.
As expected, Republican House members elected Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, formerly the majority whip, to the new post of majority leader in the next session. 
Democratic House members are scheduled to conduct their leadership elections on Thursday, and are likely to choose Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, now the minority whip, as their leader.
This morning, however, a new candidate for the job emerged, demonstrating the continuing disagreements among Democrats over how to respond to their losses in last week's elections. Representative Marcy Kaptur of Ohio said she would run for the position to draw votes from members who object to Ms. Pelosi's emphasis on fund-raising.
"We will never raise more money than the Republicans -- never," said Ms. Kaptur, who is known for her opposition to free-trade measures and federal funding for abortions. "We must elevate the non-money wing of the Democratic Party and create populist symbols to convey our message."
Ms. Kaptur joins Harold E. Ford Jr. of Tennessee in contesting the Democratic leadership election, for which Ms. Pelosi claims to already have sufficient support to win.
In the Senate, Republicans chose Trent Lott of Mississippi to be the majority leader in the next term, along with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as majority whip and Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona in the third-ranking job of leading the Republican Policy Committee. Mr. Lott said after today's election that Republicans would focus on national and economic security, mentioning specifically a prescription drug program for low-income older people and making individual retirement accounts easier to use.
Senate Democrats also held their leadership elections today, unanimously choosing Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota as chairman of the caucus, along with Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland in the No. 2 and No. 3 positions. Mr. Daschle will be minority leader in the next Senate, Mr. Reid will be minority whip.
Senators also voted 58 to 36 not to block their annual pay raise, which would increase their salaries by 3.1 percent to $154,700 to $150,000 next year. Passage of an energy bill was deferred until next year because of continuing partisan disagreements over regulation and conservation.
The Senate began a lengthier process of approving the domestic security bill, which is expected to pass as early as Friday.
Senators showed that they remained closely divided on the bill, deciding 50 to 47 to drop the Democratic version of the bill on a closely watched test vote. The new version of the bill will have enough votes for passage, but many Democrats remain upset that President Bush won virtually his entire plan to cut back on civil service protections for workers, making it easier to fire and transfer them.
Many Democrats in both chambers were furious today when they read the fine print of the new version of the bill and found that Republicans had inserted provisions that had not been discussed in the six months of debate on the antiterrorism department, or that had been cut in the Senate bill.
The new language, for example, allows the administration to reorganize the department after it is created, differing from the Senate Republican version that would require congressional approval of a reorganization. It revises a provision, passed 318 to 110 in July, that prohibited contracts with offshore tax-evading companies, allowing the department to waive the ban in the name of saving American jobs.
The bill would allow immunity from liability for companies that make faulty antiterrorism devices or technology, and would make it difficult to sue companies that make smallpox vaccinations if the vaccines cause illness.
In one last-minute addition, Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, inserted a provision that was apparently intended to protect Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical giant, from lawsuits over thimerosal, a mercury-based vaccine preservative that some parents contend has caused autism in their children.
"I'm really quite surprised they would put in the fine-print provisions we never saw in any other versions, that never even went through committees," said Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee."
But Republicans, like Representative William M. Thornberry of Texas, said the additions were minor and paled next to the importance of creating a department to protect the nation's safety.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Bin Laden and Iraq Worries Weigh Heavily on Investors

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street battled its fears about terrorism and war with Iraq yesterday, sending prices swaying throughout the session and ultimately leaving the market without a clear-cut direction. 
 While the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq index managed to end the session higher, the broader market as seen through the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell. And over all, more stocks dropped than advanced. 
 Testimony before Congress by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, provided investors with little guidance, analysts said. Mr. Greenspan said the market's decline this summer and early fall and concerns about Iraq had helped weaken the economy, yet he also described the economy as "remarkably resilient." 
The Dow closed up 12.49 points, or 0.2 percent, at 8,398.49, after climbing as much as 107 points and falling as much as 81 points. 
The Nasdaq rose 11.78 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,361.34. But the S.& P. 500 index slipped 0.42 point, or 0.05 percent, to 882.53. 
"A lot of people would like to feel that there is a reason to be in the market," said Tony Cecin, director of institutional trading at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis, adding that investors saw few reasons to make major moves yesterday. 
Stocks began the day lower amid fears of terrorism. Investors were concerned after reports on Tuesday that a tape recording said to be by Osama bin Laden had been found and that on it he had praised terrorist attacks in Bali and Moscow last month. 
But news that Iraq had agreed to a United Nations resolution calling for weapons inspections pushed shares higher. The prospect of war with Iraq contributed to a three-day slide in stocks that began late last week and continued Monday. Prices were generally higher on Tuesday. 
The news on Iraq pushed gold prices down and the dollar higher against the euro and yen. Iraq's announcement reduces the immediate threat of a spike in geopolitical tensions, said Paresh Upadhyaya, currency strategist at Putnam Investments in Boston.
Gold prices fell from a six-week high yesterday, closing down $5.20, to $319. 
In the late afternoon, stocks were down again before ending mixed. For truly sustainable gains, analysts said investors must see Iraq comply with the inspections and there must be consistent, definite improvement in earnings and the economy. 
"The shorter-term implication of Iraq is weighing on people's minds," said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. "How will it affect the Christmas season? How many are fearful there will be domestic retaliation here?" 
The upscale department store Nordstrom dropped $2.91, to $19.12, after the company issued a third-quarter profit warning. Sears, Roebuck fell $1.70, to $21, on a downgrade from Goldman, Sachs. 
Campbell Soup rose $1.63, to $21.42, on first-quarter earnings that were 3 cents a share higher than analysts expected. 
Tiffany climbed $1.76, to $26.59, on third-quarter earnings that were a penny a share higher than expectations. --------------------

Treasury Prices Increase
By Bloomberg News
Treasury prices rose yesterday after Mr. Greenspan said inflation was "well contained."
The benchmark 10-year note gained as investors said slowing inflation would protect the value of fixed-rate payments on debt. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 3/32 , to 101 11/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, was 3.84 percent, down from 3.85 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 5/32 , to 109 2/32 . The yield fell to 4.79 percent from 4.80 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price: 99.907

HEADLINE: The Pitch: Dreamland Goes Digital 

BYLINE:  By MICHEL MARRIOTT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
IT'S early in the morning when a set that looks like a head-on collision of a computer repair shop with a retro-funky college dorm room flickers to life on a bank of control room monitors. Two hours later Cory Rouse, a standup comedian and the host of a half-hour review show, leaps before cameras and a potential audience of six million households that receive G4, a new cable network. Like every offering on the network, round the clock, his program has a single theme: video games. 
 A short drive away, in a suite of offices as austere as a factory floor, Damon Lee begins another day's work as a top executive for Urban Entertainment, which produces short animated films for the Internet with the goal of spinning the most commercially promising into movies and television series. One of his latest projects is "The Shonuffs," a kind of African-American "Beverly Hillbillies," a catfish-out-of-water comedy. 
And in their headquarters beneath a spacious Mediterranean-style home in the Hollywood Hills, Evette Vargas and Carlos Arriaga, transplanted New Yorkers and founders of a Web development studio called Digital-Reign, talk about their growing roster of clients like the Recording Academy and Madonna and polish a digital pitch for a new television series. 
 All three companies, formed in the late 1990's, have merged computer know-how and ingenuity with entertainment, the biggest business in town. And so, even in the aftermath of the dot-com implosion, they are contributing to a long-standing dream of planners, politicians and business leaders here to make Los Angeles a multimedia crossroads. 
 The commingling of geeks and moguls is producing results far beyond the marriage of computers with traditional television and film production, economists and executives here say. It is creating fresh types of entertainment and novel approaches to developing, distributing and promoting it.
 "There is something happening here," said Ross DeVol, director of regional and demographic studies at the Milken Institute, an economic research group in Santa Monica, Calif. "I think there are early signs of a critical-mass happening that is helping to make Greater Los Angeles the center of two overlapping sections -- entertainment and technology."
 The integration of digital technologies to transmit copies of a day's filming over the Web to a production team is creating a "highly collaborative model" for filmmakers as well as technologists, he said. In other instances, new revenue is being generated from adaptive uses of Hollywood, like basing video games on characters and stories from films and television. 
 "There is no substitute for proximity," said Bobby Kotick, co-chairman and chief executive of Activision, a major game developer that moved here in 1992 from Silicon Valley. Noting that Activision was, for example, Columbia Pictures' choice to produce the video game based on "Spider-Man," he added, "Being here puts us in a very good competitive position." 
 Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit business association, noted increases in the demand for film, television and advertising rooted in digital technology. "We are seeing all kinds of intersections between technology and entertainment," he said, although the economic impact is difficult to gauge accurately because of outdated statistical categories that, for example, lump computer software jobs with business services. 
 "You look at the numbers," he said, "but then you have to talk to lots of people. The anecdotal information tells you more."

Video Games Meet Cable TV
 G4 began operations only last April -- with a $150 million commitment by its owner, the cable giant Comcast -- but its offices and cubicles on the 11th floor of an industrial office complex look remarkably lived in. Most reflect the sort of whimsy and open-collar ease typical of technology businesses, where workers with spiked hair and body piercing outnumber those wearing Rolexes and business suits. After all, said Scot Rubin, a G4 vice president and the host of one of its weekly shows, "it's a game channel." 
 Video arcade games are in the hallway near the glass office of Charles Hirschhorn, the network's founder and chief executive. His office television plays a live feed of the network's programming, which has been compared, admiringly or otherwise, to the heady early days of MTV. 
 Now, said Mr. Hirschhorn, a soft-spoken 45-year-old former movie producer and recent president for television and television animation at Walt Disney, it is the video-gaming generation's turn to innovate television. 
 "Our timing is very good," he said of the network's debut, which came shortly before Comcast was holding talks on acquiring AT&T Broadband's cable system. Earlier this month G4 announced an agreement with Time Warner Cable that will double the number of households receiving the channel over the next two years.
 Its original programming -- currently 13 weekly shows -- examines who plays games, how they play games and which games are good, as well as presenting histories of video game innovators over the last 30 years. A companion Web site encourages chats, polls and message boards of viewers and would-be viewers. 
 "Certainly the video game industry has proven -- I guess more so amidst the meltdown of other technology businesses -- that it is a fantastically fundamental technology business that is so popular and growing and has real loyal support," Mr. Hirschhorn said. 
 It was his recognition of the video game industry's explosive growth while he was a president at Disney that moved him, he said, to approach Comcast two years ago and propose an all-video-game network. He said that to anyone looking closely at entertainment for 12- to 34-year-olds -- in terms of growth and revenue, time spent on leisure activities and the penetration of home electronics -- "video games always spike out." When he looked to see what television was doing to serve this growing constituency, he said, he saw nothing but opportunity. 
 Now, Mr. Hirschhorn said, advertisers are beginning to take note of G4 as well. 
 "I think they have begun to recognize gamers just like they recognize college-educated adults, or soccer moms, as just another sort of socio-demographic-economic group that they want to appeal to," he said. "The fact is that they can now find them exclusively on one programming service." 

Online Incubator for Black Talent
 Considering the colorful characters and comic circumstances that dominate the short films that come to life at the click of a mouse at Urban Entertainment's Web site, the company's offices on Sunset Boulevard near Beverly Hills are downright sedate. The only sounds during a recent afternoon were a business call under way in a corner office and in another, the faint scribbling of a note on a script. 
 "I think we have created an environment in which executives can thrive and focus," said Michael Jenkinson, 41, the founder and chief executive of Urban Entertainment, a Web-based production, exhibition and distribution company that is increasingly mixing high technology with traditional film and television production. 
 Mr. Jenkinson, an African-American and a former vice president at 20th Century Fox, started the company in 1999 and set about luring executives like Damon Lee, 33, a former vice president of a mainstream movie studio. 
 Mr. Lee, who became the company's president, said he immediately understood Mr. Jenkinson's concept. In short, it was the use of digital technology and low-cost Internet distribution to give writers and artists, many of whom would be black, a platform to develop new kinds of stories and characters that major studios were unlikely to commit large sums to produce. 
 The idea was to attract leading writers and film directors with urban sensibilities like John Singleton, Malcolm Lee, Cheo Hodari Coker, Reginald Hudlin, Tina Andrews and John Ridley, and render their visions into three-minute cartoons using low-cost Flash animation. Then the films, along with purchased conventional shorts, would be posted at the company's Web site with an invitation for comment. 
 "We thought our position in the marketplace would be to marry the experts in the technologies with the proven storytellers," Mr. Jenkinson said. 
 Soon Urban Entertainment's Web site (www.urbanentertainment.com) bristled with serial offerings like "Sistas 'N the City," "My Babies' Mamas" and "Driving While Black." The films -- mostly loving and sometimes biting lampoons of ghetto life and of how some try to escape it -- are best appreciated with a high-speed Internet connection and can be downloaded free. Then, if a film develops a vocal and loyal following, Urban Entertainment may pitch the concept to a studio like Universal as a live-action feature or television series. 
 That is precisely what happened with "Undercover Brother," a story about an Afro-wearing urban spy that went from online cartoon to big-screen movie, receiving critical approval along the way. Released over the summer, it cost $35 million to make and took in $38 million at the box office.
 That is a modest success for the company, but Mr. Jenkinson and Damon Lee, who is also African-American, say they are not discouraged. They have three other projects in development at major studios. 
 They said they were also in discussions with other Web sites that are seeking original short films. That is the type of business opportunity that many of their competitors, less successful in keeping costs and overhead low, did not survive to take advantage of. 
 "It's great," Mr. Lee said, surveying the online landscape that appears wide open to Urban Entertainment. "It's great being the last man standing, and African-American."

Pushing Digital Design's Limits
 It wasn't as if Evette Vargas and Carlos Arriaga weren't making a good living in New York. They created and operated a small but successful graphics company from their Greenwich Village loft apartment for a few years in the late 1990's. 
 But they wanted more, especially Ms. Vargas, who as a graduate of New York University's undergraduate film program, wanted to push her mastery of digital graphics and filmmaking much further. "I wanted to tell stories," she said. She and Mr. Arriaga said they became seized with a desire to apply their talents and time to something beyond retouching photographs and polishing advertising campaigns. They wanted to make entertainment. 
 In 1998, Ms. Vargas and Mr. Arriaga, both New York-born and of Puerto Rican descent, closed their company, packed up and headed for Los Angeles in search of a new creative life. Here the couple, now married, created Digital-Reign, a bustling Web site design house and content developer that seems to have more branches than an olive tree.
 Digital-Reign is an example of an emerging class of entertainment-oriented companies that use cutting-edge digital technologies to churn out anything from high-quality animation to music videos.
 One project that helped Ms. Vargas and Mr. Arriaga distinguish their work from more pedestrian Web design is a site that Digital-Reign did for Madonna. Thousands of minutes of songs and videos, hundreds of photographs and reams of text are categorized and displayed in a cinematic style that many say pushes the boundaries of what an artist site can do. 
 Ms. Vargas and Mr. Arriga have also turned to Flash animation to create their own concepts for fully animated music videos for the Baha Men and Wu-Tang Clan. Digital-Reign designs company logos and is developing digital tools to enhance communications and productivity for business Intranets. 
 Like most of the employees of their 10-person company, Ms. Vargas and Mr. Arriaga work from home. "The technology makes all of that possible," said Mr. Arriaga, 42, the company's art director and manager. He set up the company's workstations and server in the three-office sprawl of desks, computers and art objects where the couple work. He learned some of his graphics and electronics skills on the job and taught himself the rest.
 Ms. Vargas, who says she prefers to give her age as "30-something," is driven and charming and does most of the talking. They both say that over the years of living and working together, their creative styles have melded especially well in Los Angeles. 
 "It was a great move," Ms. Vargas, chief executive and creative director of the company, said about replanting their business roots in California. "It was the right move. We wanted to be close to the entertainment industry. We wanted to be able to play like the big boys."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
The apple falls close to the tree, even in the land of opportunity.

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University and editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. E-mail:akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
IT seems increasingly apparent that the secret to success is to have a successful parent. Consider some prominent examples: George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush; Bobby Bonds and Barry Bonds; Henry Fonda and Jane Fonda; Estee Lauder and Ronald Lauder; Julio Iglesias and Enrique Iglesias; Sam Walton and Jim, John, S. Robson and Alice Walton.
 As more recent and better data have become available, economists have marked up their estimate of the impact of parents' socioeconomic status on their children's likelihood of economic success. 
 It turns out that the famous line attributed to Andrew Carnegie -- "from shirt-sleeves to shirt-sleeves in three generations" -- is an understatement. Five or six generations are probably required, on average, to erase the advantages or disadvantages of one's economic origins. 
This represents a marked departure from past thinking. In the 1980's, when Gary S. Becker of the University of Chicago pioneered the economic theory of intergenerational transmission of economic status, it was believed that the correlation between a father's and son's income was only around 0.15 -- less than half the correlation between fathers' and sons' heights. 
The early studies suggested that if a father's income was twice the average, his son's expected income would be 15 percent above average, and his grandson's just 2 percent above average. This is fast "regression to the mean," a concept Sir Francis Galton used to describe the progression of offspring toward the average height.
Landmark studies published by Gary Solon of the University of Michigan and David J. Zimmerman of Williams College in The American Economic Review a decade ago, however, led economists to revise substantially upward the estimate of the similarity of fathers' and sons' incomes. They noted that income fluctuated for idiosyncratic reasons from year to year -- an employee could lose a job, for example -- so estimates that depended on a single year were based on "noisy" data. Also, the samples previously analyzed represented only a narrow slice of the population at different points in individual careers. These factors caused the correlation in annual incomes to understate the correlation in "lifetime" incomes. 
Averaging earnings over five years produced a correlation of around 0.40 for fathers' and sons' earnings -- the same as the correlation between their heights. If people's incomes were represented by their heights, the similarity in income between generations would resemble the similarity observed in the heights of fathers and sons. 
New studies by Bhashkar Mazumder of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago suggest that the similarity in income is even greater. Using Social Security records, he averaged fathers' earnings over 16 years (1970 through 1985) and sons' earnings over four years (1995 through 1998), and found that around 65 percent of the earnings advantage of fathers was transmitted to sons. The wider window provides a better reflection of lifetime earnings. 
The relationship between fathers' and daughters' earnings was just as strong.
So that grandson (or granddaughter) mentioned previously could expect to earn 42 percent more than average. After five generations, the earnings advantage would still be 12 percent. 
Furthermore, the degree of persistence across generations is strong for both rich and poor. Thomas Hertz of American University finds that a child born in the bottom 10 percent of families ranked by income has a 31 percent chance of ending up there as an adult and a 51 percent chance of ending up in the bottom 20 percent, while one born in the top 10 percent has a 30 percent chance of staying there and a 43 percent chance of being in the top 20 percent.
In another study, David I. Levine of Berkeley and Dr. Mazumder found that the impact of parental income on adult sons' income increased from 1980 to the early 1990's. 
Why is there such a strong connection between parents' socioeconomic status and their children's? A large part of the answer involves intergenerational transmission of cognitive ability and educational level. 
But these factors can "explain at most three-fifths of the intergenerational transmission of economic status," Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis of the University of Massachusetts wrote in the latest issue of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. They suggest that the intergenerational transmission of race, geographical location, height, beauty, health status and personality also plays a significant role. 
Arthur S. Goldberger of the University of Wisconsin has long questioned whether knowledge of the "heritability" of income is of much use. Even if the father-son correlation is high because traits that affect earning power are inherited, well-designed interventions could still be cost effective and improve the lot of the disadvantaged. 
To take an extreme example, the correlation in incomes between fathers and sons was high in South Africa under apartheid because race is an inherited trait. The abolition of apartheid reduced the correlation. The organization of society matters. 
Perhaps the only legitimate use of the intergenerational correlation in income is to characterize economic mobility. The data challenge the notion that the United States is an exceptionally mobile society. If the United States stands out in comparison with other countries, it is in having a more static distribution of income across generations with fewer opportunities for advancement. 
Anders Bjorklund of Stockholm University and Markus Jantti of the University of Tampere in Finland, for example, find more economic mobility in Sweden than in the United States. Only South Africa and Britain have as little mobility across generations as the United States.
Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader are an unusual father-son pair; in most families, the apple does not fall so far from the tree.

Financial Turmoil Intensifies at Interpublic Group

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
The financial turmoil over unexpected charges, along with reduced earnings and revenue, has intensified at the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York, the world's second-largest advertising agency company. Third-quarter results came in far lower, and a restatement of past earnings far higher, than had been estimated only a month ago.
 The impact of the news, which came after the stock market closed yesterday, was felt immediately. Interpublic, which operates leading agencies like Deutsch; Foote, Cone & Belding; and Lowe & Partners, said it would create the post of chief operating officer under John J. Dooner Jr., the chairman and chief executive since January 2001, and begin a search for someone to fill the job. 
 There had been speculation that such a post might be created after recent discussions by Mr. Dooner and the Interpublic board about trying to bolster Interpublic's operational and financial systems and controls. There has also been speculation that what several analysts described as the "mess" at Interpublic might cost a top executive or two their jobs, but no heads rolled yesterday.
Interpublic also said it would delay by five days, until Tuesday, the release of its 10-Q quarterly financial report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had been scheduled for today; details of its third-quarter results, which had been scheduled for yesterday; and an analysis of results for the first nine months of 2002, also expected yesterday. This becomes the second consecutive quarter that the release of earnings data has been postponed.
The information is being withheld, Mr. Dooner said in a conference call, because of the delay in completing an investigation started three months ago to determine the charges that would be required to rectify accounting irregularities at the European operations of the McCann-Erickson World Group, Interpublic's largest division.
"It's unbelievable; I'm dumbfounded," Alexia Quadrani, the advertising analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company in New York, said after listening to the brief conference call. During the call, which ended without questions being taken, Mr. Dooner and Sean F. Orr, the Interpublic executive vice president and chief financial officer, once again lowered the figure for third-quarter earnings, this time to 2 cents a share from 8 to 10 cents; before August, some analysts had predicted as much as 28 cents.
The two executives also again raised the figure for the noncash charges dating back to 1997, to $181.3 million, from $120 million and $68.5 million before that -- meaning it will be almost triple what was initially estimated.
"Every time you convince yourself you will not be disappointed again, you're surprised on the downside," Ms. Quadrani said, referring to the statements and restatements. "I'd like to think this is the end of it, but I would not place that bet."
The tumult has been vexing Interpublic and its shareholders, clients and employees continually since August as Mr. Dooner struggled to steer the company through the accounting and earnings problems, along with trouble at some operations devoted to nonadvertising specialties like motor-sports marketing, corporate identity and promotions. 
Moody's Investors Service has downgraded Interpublic debt, saying cash flow is not sufficient to pay for acquisitions and dividends and pay down debt, while Standard & Poor's has downgraded Interpublic's long-term credit rating to only two notches above junk status.
At the same time, Interpublic has been forced to contend with the industrywide slowdown in revenue and earnings growth because of the struggling economies in large markets like Japan, Latin America and the United States. Indeed, Mr. Dooner and Mr. Orr said revenue for the third quarter totaled $1.5 billion, down 6.3 percent from $1.6 billion a year earlier; there were no prior estimates for revenue.
"I'm expressing my disappointment and frustration that this restatement issue has haunted Interpublic," Mr. Dooner said during the conference call. He offered his regrets to Interpublic shareholders, whose stock has lost 57 percent this year. The shares closed yesterday at $12.58, down 36 cents; they fell as low as $10.88 in after-hours trading.
"Clearly, if it wasn't before, this is a 'show me' story for investors," said David Doft, the advertising industry analyst for CIBC World Markets in New York. "Time needs to pass with no new news for investors to be comfortable" with buying Interpublic shares.
During the conference call, Mr. Orr described the investigation as having expanded to include two Big Four accounting firms, two law firms and visits to 50 countries, requiring auditors to expend "tens of thousands of man-hours" looking at thousands of documents related to the interagency accounting irregularities involving scores of units of McCann.
"We're confident the process is complete," Mr. Orr said, adding that the restatements would be "noncash adjustments" limited primarily to 1997 through 2001.
The reason third-quarter earnings totaled 2 cents rather than 8 to 10 cents, the figure he and Mr. Dooner offered on Oct. 16, was that a charge of "at least 6 cents needed to be taken in the current period," involving to the irregularities at McCann, Mr. Orr said.
Interpublic has a leading executive recruiting firm, which was not identified, seeking a successor to Salvatore LaGreca, the vice chairman and chief financial officer at McCann, who announced last month that he would leave in early 2003. In the meantime, Mr. Orr said, Joseph Studly, a former Interpublic controller who had been the chief financial officer at another division, Advanced Marketing Services, is serving as the controller at McCann.
In addition to the Interpublic accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte Touche has been helping with the investigation. The law firm that was brought in to help the regular Interpublic law firm, Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, was not identified.
Mr. Dooner and Mr. Orr said further data would be shared with analysts and investors in a conference call on Tuesday to coincide with the planned release of the 10-Q report.
"Thankfully, we can finally put this behind us" at that time, Mr. Dooner promised, "and really, really focus on growth for Interpublic."
Mr. Doft, the CIBC analyst, said he did see some glimmers of light at the end of the proverbial tunnel "if this is truly over and they can focus on business."
"A good chief operating officer who could step up the oversight of the moving pieces would be welcome," he added, but there may be further repercussions for Interpublic's credit rating because of the larger restatements.
Whether the chief operating officer will have an advertising background or a financial background will help signal Wall Street as to what areas the members of the Interpublic board believe need additional expertise. The board last week named Frank J. Borelli, a member with extensive experience as a chief financial officer, to take the new post of presiding director.

Americans and Those in the World Who Resent Them

BYLINE:  By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:
THE EAGLE'S SHADOW
Why America Fascinates and Infuriates the World
By Mark Hertsgaard
236 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $23.
 Six years before the events of Sept. 11, 2001, the scholar Benjamin R. Barber wrote a provocative and in some ways very prescient book, "Jihad vs. McWorld," which explored the growing post-cold-war tensions between secular consumerist capitalism and religious and ethnic fundamentalism; between the Americanized global marketplace and tribal movements virulently opposed to modernity. 
 The subtitle of Mark Hertsgaard's new book, "The Eagle's Shadow" -- "Why America Fascinates and Infuriates the World" -- suggests that the author is going to take up where Mr. Barber left off, exploring the envy, worship and rage that America elicits abroad. But while Mr. Hertsgaard lifts some of Mr. Barber's ideas about the Americanization of global pop culture and the resentment it incurs, he neither delivers on his promise to explore "how we look to the rest of the world" nor communicates to foreigners "why America and Americans are the way we are."
Instead, he has written a hectoring, fuzzy-minded book that devolves into an angry personal rant about what the author thinks is wrong about America: we are treated to long-winded and poorly reasoned diatribes about the presidential election of 2000, the inequality between rich and poor in the United States, and what the author describes as our hypocritical backing of "treacherous dictatorships that serve our perceived interests."
Although Mr. Hertsgaard, a writer who is a contributor to National Public Radio, says he has spent 20 years living and traveling abroad through some 30 countries, his interviews with foreigners are sparsely sprinkled through this book. And they are thoroughly random in nature: a London cabbie here, a couple of South African teenagers there; a Japanese art historian in one chapter, an Egyptian salesman in another.
Instead of seriously probing people's thoughts about America, he settles for making his own cliched generalizations. "Americans are friendly but boorish, clever but shallow, prosperous but lonely," he says of foreigners' perceptions of the United States. "They are drowning in material possessions but poor in family, friends, and community. They are oddly moralistic; they seem to find sex shameful but violence beautiful. Above all, they live to work rather than work to live." A few pages later, he adds that we are "vulgar yet devout, modern yet old-fashioned, self-righteous yet rootless."
There are many significant issues raised in this book, from the consequences of America's accelerating exportation of pop culture to its current proclivity for unilateral action. But the valid points that Mr. Hertsgaard wants to make about such matters are smothered by his penchant for overstatement and outright distortion -- and his consequent unreliability as an observer.
Indeed "The Eagle's Shadow" is filled with dubious generalizations and outrageous assertions. Mr. Hertsgaard writes that "our democracy is an embarrassment to the word, a den of entrenched bureaucrats and legal bribery." He writes that "our media are a disgrace to the hallowed concept of freedom of the press," that they "may as well be a formal part of the government, for all the critical distance they usually maintain." And he compares America's bombing of Dresden during World War II to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, arguing that both acts "pursued military or political objectives by killing vast numbers of civilians."
"When we are ready to face facts again," he argues, "we may see that our country was in crisis before bin Laden's bombers set off on their mission of hate. Politically, we live in a democracy that barely deserves the name."
Mr. Hertsgaard's skills as a logician turn out to be as poor as his skills as a political commentator. He suggests that the country's current economic woes are the result of a drop in consumer spending that reflects a post-9/11 "turning away from self-indulgence and material things" -- never mind the drop in the stock market or rising unemployment. And he writes that "achieving economic justice in America is an imposing challenge, but no more imposing than the Wizard of Oz's command that Dorothy and her compatriots bring him the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West" -- never mind that Oz's command is that of a humbug who simply wants to send Dorothy and her friends off on a wild goose chase.
Not surprisingly, the writing in "The Eagle's Shadow" proves as flabby as its arguments. Mr. Hertsgaard exhorts us to "fight to restore fairness and fiber to our democracy" -- Grape-Nuts, anyone? -- and he concludes this embarrassing book with a dreamy vision that equates the United States with a lava-spewing mountain. "If volcanoes can be beautiful as well as deadly," he writes, "why can't America be wise as well as powerful, generous as well as rich, magnanimous as well as proud?"

HEADLINE: Argentina Defaults on Big Payment to World Bank 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Argentina defaulted today on an $805 million loan installment that it owed the World Bank and said it would resume payment of its obligations only when the International Monetary Fund agreed to restore a credit line that was cut off late last year.
 "To pay today, in these conditions, would be risky for the economy," which is mired in the worst slump in Argentine history, President Eduardo Duhalde said at a news conference here this afternoon. "I refuse to make promises that cannot be fulfilled." 
 Argentina did make a token $77 million interest payment today, allowing Mr. Duhalde to maintain that the action does not amount to a true default on Argentina's last remaining source of external financing. "Argentina has a firm commitment to meet its obligations once an agreement is reached" with the I.M.F., he said, but cannot afford to dip into its diminished $9.8 billion in foreign reserves to pay back creditors. 
The I.M.F. suspended disbursements to Argentina nearly a year ago after the government then in power had repeatedly fallen short of fiscal targets it had promised to meet in return for financing. Shortly thereafter, an interim Peronist government defaulted on most of the country's $141 billion commercial debt, which has led private creditors to shun additional loans to Argentina.
Mr. Duhalde, also a Peronist, came to power in January and resumed negotiations with the I.M.F. The government has several times announced that an agreement is imminent, only to backtrack when it became clear that new hurdles had arisen, as was the case during a supposedly definitive round of talks this week.
"There are certain issues that are a matter of judgment," Guillermo Nielsen, the finance secretary, said in Washington on Wednesday after meeting with an I.M.F. negotiating team. "You may see a half-empty or half-full glass. We see it as half full."
Officials here said the two sides were still deadlocked on issues ranging from tax and utility rates to expansion of the money supply and bankruptcy procedures. Particularly controversial is the question of some 250,000 mortgages that are not being repaid: the government claims that it is under pressure from the I.M.F. to begin foreclosures on those loans as a way of assuring banks that existing contracts will be honored.
Argentine officials said I.M.F. negotiators had also complained of "a lack of political consensus" that would give lenders confidence that the government would fulfill the terms of any agreement it signs. But with a presidential election scheduled for early next year, the talks with the I.M.F. have themselves become one of the most contentious campaign issues.
"If they are asking us for more taxes, more belt-tightening or throwing people out into the streets, then there is nothing to talk about," Jose Manuel de la Sota, the governor of Cordoba Province and a contender for the Peronist party nomination, declared today. "These recipes have brought us to this crisis, which is killing children."
As if to underline his willingness to stand up to anyone prescribing more austerity for his country, Mr. Duhalde also announced today that he was cutting the country's value-added tax by two points, from 21 percent to 19 percent. "The president has the authority to take steps to reactivate the economy," Mr. Duhalde said, adding that he would announce other stimulus measures soon.
One result of today's default, though, is that it jeopardizes future World Bank loans for social programs to alleviate the crisis here. Argentina was scheduled to receive $600 million in loans next week, but the rules of the World Bank prohibit further disbursement of funds to countries that are in arrears on their obligations.

HEADLINE: Deutsche Telekom Names Chief Executive 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: BONN, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Deutsche Telekom, the debt-burdened German telephone colossus, named the 41-year-old son of one of its former bosses as chief executive today, ending a four-month search that was distinguished by the number of people who did not want the job.
 The official, Kai-Uwe Ricke, will take over a fragile company, still struggling to digest the expensive overseas acquisitions made by his predecessor, Ron Sommer, who was ousted last July in a boardroom purge orchestrated by the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder. 
 The cost of Mr. Sommer's ambitions was evident in Deutsche Telekom's latest earnings, also released today. It reported a loss of $24.7 billion in the first nine months of 2002 after it wrote off $18 billion in the value of its United States cellular subsidiary, VoiceStream. 
That is one of the biggest losses in European corporate history. And it left Mr. Ricke, a trusted lieutenant of Mr. Sommer who ran Deutsche Telekom's mobile phone operations, understandably eager to turn the page, as he made his debut at a crowded news conference here.
"My job is not to justify what has happened in the past," Mr. Ricke said. "It is easy to be wise in looking back at events. I want to do what is necessary to ensure a brighter future for Deutsche Telekom."
In some ways, Mr. Ricke is more a link to the past. His father, Helmut Ricke, led Deutsche Telekom through its transition from a state-owned monopoly to a commercial company in the early 1990's. His successor, Mr. Sommer, was recruited from Sony to sell Telekom stock to the German public.
With those shares now in the gutter, it is the younger Mr. Ricke's job to win back investors. Today, he laid out a plan to reduce the company's $64 billion in debt by about $12 billion by the end of 2003, through cost-cutting, increased cash flow and the sale of various assets.
That list does not include VoiceStream, which many analysts view as the culprit for much of Deutsche Telekom's financial misery. Mr. Ricke said the company, which has been renamed T-Mobile USA, would fetch too little, and was growing too fast, to justify selling it now.
Mr. Ricke said he was receptive to merging VoiceStream with another provider, which would increase its market share and might allow Deutsche Telekom to shift some debt off its balance sheet. AT&T Wireless and Cingular Wireless are the two most likely partners for such a combination. Cingular is owned by SBC Communications and BellSouth.
"We will keep all our options open in the U.S.," Mr. Ricke said. "What we don't want to do is to auction off assets."
In its choice of an insider as chief executive and in its decision to eschew more radical changes, Deutsche Telekom resembles nothing so much as the German government, which owns 43 percent of the company's shares and plays a pivotal behind-the-scenes role in its direction.
Like Germany, critics say, Deutsche Telekom is in urgent need of a top-to-bottom overhaul. And like Germany, which recently re-elected Chancellor Schroder despite his widely criticized economic policies, Deutsche Telekom chose a leader who is less likely to overturn the status quo.
Mr. Ricke was supported by the company's powerful trade unions, which hold several seats on the board and must agree to the company's plans to cut 43,400 jobs over the next few years. Because of his background, the unions contend that Mr. Ricke will be more likely to protect jobs than an outsider.
In an early sign of labor disputes to come, hundreds of workers protested on Wednesday against possible layoffs at Deutsche Telekom's sprawling headquarters in Bonn, the former West German capital.
"We are used to this kind of resistance," said Boris Boehm, a money manager at Nordinvest in Hamburg. "As a holder of Telekom stock, I know I will have to be patient and wait a while for the big changes."
Mr. Boehm said he was encouraged that Mr. Ricke had ties to Mr. Sommer because it suggested that Deutsche Telekom would not abandon its strategy of becoming a global player in telecommunications.
Indeed, in their review of operations today, the company's officials seemed most enthusiastic in discussing the growth in VoiceStream's cellular subscribers in New York, Chicago and San Francisco.
Though still No. 6 in the American market, VoiceStream's subscribers grew 10.8 percent in the third quarter, to 8.9 million -- a pace that Mr. Ricke said outstripped that of any other cellular provider.
Still, analysts said Telekom faced a murky future in a cellular market that is likely to consolidate into a handful of giants. Some regard its enthusiasm about VoiceStream as posturing to drive up the price.
"It makes more sense for them to sell it to someone like Cingular and build on that partnership," said Rudy Baca, an analyst at the Precursor Group, an independent research firm in Washington. "They'll call it a merger or a joint venture, but it will be a change of control."
The company went to similar pains to play down the rumors surrounding the search process. Newspapers here have carried almost weekly reports about the latest German industrialist or executive who rebuffed an approach from Deutsche Telekom's supervisory board.
Helmut Sihler, the 72-year-old board member who became interim chief after Mr. Sommer's ouster, insisted that only one outside candidate turned down the job and that his name did not appear in newspapers.
Still, many prominent business-people pre-emptively declared their lack of interest. Analysts say outsiders were skeptical of taking over a company with huge debts, entrenched unions and a controlling shareholder -- the government -- that is not likely to countenance draconian remedies.
Analysts say Mr. Ricke, whose close-cropped, sandy hair makes him look barely his age, does not have the experience to play that role. He came to Deutsche Telekom in 1998 after stints at a bank, a small mobile phone company, and the media conglomerate Bertelsmann. 
People who know Mr. Ricke say he is a conscientious executive who burrows into the details of his business. Given his background in marketing, however, some said they were surprised by his low profile.
"You just don't hear a lot about him when you meet with customers or people in the industry," said one banker who has advised the company. "He may be deliberately quiet because of who his father is."
Mr. Ricke seemed aware his family lineage might prejudice people. "One thing I will make clear," he declared. "I am my own man. I am not realizing the ambitions of another."

The unemployment rate in New York City shot up to 7.8 percent in October, from 7.1 percent the previous month, in the steepest one-month rise since 1989, according to data released yesterday by the New York State Department of Labor.
 The jobless rate has now almost returned to the seasonally adjusted rate of 8 percent it hit in May and June. Some economists have suggested that the declines in late summer that took the rate down to 7.1 percent might have been statistical aberrations. 
 "It probably indicates what we all suspected -- that there hasn't been a dramatic change in the city's economy," said James P. Brown, an analyst for the Labor Department.
Meanwhile, the number of jobs in the city fell by 12,300 in October, according to the city comptroller's office, which adjusts the Labor Department data to take account of seasonal factors. It was the steepest decline this year, the comptroller's office said, adding that much of the drop occurred in city government and at agencies like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Manufacturing, finance and transportation continued to show large drops in employment on a seasonally adjusted basis, the office reported. The only industry to show a gain was construction.
Retailers did hire some workers in October to prepare for the holiday season, Mr. Brown said, but not as many as in a number of previous years. Because Thanksgiving is late this year, they may simply be doing their hiring a little later, he said, adding, "I'll be looking at November's numbers with great interest."
In the rest of the state, the unemployment rate edged down to 4.4 percent in October from 4.5 percent in September. For the state as a whole, the rate is 5.7 percent, the same as the national average. 
The total number of jobs in the state rose last month, but by a smaller number than usual for October. The number of private-sector jobs climbed by 21,300; over the previous decade, October employment increased by an average of 27,100.

HEADLINE: Two Boards Are Appointed To Guide Sept. 11 Memorial 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation appointed two committees this week to oversee the 9/11 memorial effort, as part of what the agency's chairman called a "new phase" in rebuilding downtown. He also said yesterday that the public would be able to see exhibits next month showing the new plans for the World Trade Center site.
 After focusing for much of the last year on the design of the trade center site, officials have recently moved to integrate that planning with similar efforts for the memorial. 
 One of the memorial committees, with 10 members, will oversee the drafting of a mission statement, outlining the memorial's purpose and the experience that planners want the site's visitors to have. 
A second committee, with 11 members, will draft a plan for the memorial, outlining its general content, including the names of victims and any desired features or exhibits.
Seven of the 21 committee members are relatives of people killed in the attack on the trade center last year, and 12, including most of those relatives of victims, are members of various advisory committees appointed by the development corporation in January to assist the rebuilding effort.
Other members include representatives from the Police and Fire Departments who worked at the site during the rescue and recovery effort, downtown residents and business owners. Also included is the Rev. Alex Karloutsos from the St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, which was across Liberty Street from the trade center and was destroyed in the collapse of the towers.
Some victims' relatives have complained that they do not make up a majority of the committee members, and some have also complained that several advisory committee members who have been the most vocal over the last year in public discussions about the memorial and the rebuilding were not included.
Anita F. Contini, the development corporation's vice president for memorial, cultural and civic programs, said that in choosing the committee members, "it was important to add other voices" to those on the advisory committees. 
The new designs for the trade center site from seven teams of architects will be displayed to the public in an exhibition in the Winter Garden at the World Financial Center next month, officials said yesterday.
Officials of the development corporation, which is overseeing the rebuilding effort, have refused to comment on any of the details of the work being undertaken by the seven teams, which were charged with conceiving designs for the trade center site and nearby areas. 
But they have promised that the work will not resemble the renderings of six site plans that drew nearly universal disdain when they were unveiled last summer. One architecture team has said it needs a room with an 18-foot ceiling to display its model, said two rebuilding officials. Another design team has a scale model of Lower Manhattan that measures roughly 20 feet in length.
"Our planning department reports that the designers' very preliminary ideas are highly varied, but they have one thing in common: they are infused with imagination," John C. Whitehead, the chairman of the development corporation, said yesterday at a meeting of the agency's board.
"A lot will change before their work is done, but the amount of brain power and artistry and effort they are already investing is impressive indeed," Mr. Whitehead said. "Their concepts are sure to spur discussion and debate as we had intended."
All of the designs will be presented in the public exhibition, which is expected to cost up to $200,000, before the development corporation narrows the work to three final design options by the end of January.
Mr. Whitehead also responded to recent news reports that some officials close to Gov. George E. Pataki had urged the governor to replace him. "I have no plans to leave, and the governor and the mayor have no plans to fire me," Mr. Whitehead said. "I'm in office to stay."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Rally Broadly, Led by Retail Sales and Earnings

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street had its best day in a month yesterday with buyers reasserting themselves amid upbeat news about consumer spending. The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 140 points, while the Nasdaq index jumped 50.
 Investors were heartened by stronger-than-expected October retail sales, and by earnings from Target and other merchants that beat forecasts. Analysts said the market also drew some strength from Iraq's agreement on Wednesday to a United Nations resolution calling for weapons inspections. 
 The Dow closed up 143.64 points, or 1.7 percent, at 8,542.13, adding to Wednesday's 12-point gain. It was the Dow's best one-day advance in nearly a month, or since Oct. 21, when it rose 215.84 points.
The broader market posted its best gains in a month. The Nasdaq climbed 50.18 points, or 3.7 percent, to 1,411.52. The rise was the Nasdaq's best one-day gain since Oct. 15, when it climbed 61.91 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 21.74 points, or 2.5 percent, to 904.27. It was also the S.& P.'s best one-day gain since Oct. 15, when it rose 39.83 points. 
Investors bought stocks yesterday with a zeal that had been lacking in recent sessions, including Wednesday, when the market vacillated between gains and losses. 
"The market has been boosted by the good retail sales numbers and the fact that the imminence of U.S. military action against Iraq has been delayed," said Alan Ackerman, executive vice president at Fahnestock & Company. "Those two events have been a magnet for money."
Yesterday's rally came after news that retail sales were flat in October, better than the 0.2 percent decline analysts had expected. It was also an improvement over a 1.3 percent drop in sales for September.
Retailing stocks were strong. Target increased $3.46, or 11.5 percent, to $33.49 on third-quarter earnings that were 2 cents a share higher than anticipated. American Eagle Outfitters, which beat earnings expectations by 3 cents a share, advanced $1, to $18. 
"People are looking for reasons to buy stocks, rather than sell them," said Michael Murphy, head trader for Wachovia Securities. "When investor psychology changes, that is what happens. Two months ago, nobody wanted to buy." 
While the advances were widespread across sectors, analysts were most encouraged by the gains in technology shares, which came despite disappointing news from Applied Materials, the chip equipment maker. The company issued a profit warning late Wednesday for its first quarter. Still, Applied Materials managed to rise $1.06, to $15.76. 
Dell Computer rose 89 cents, to $30.94, ahead of its third-quarter earnings. After the market closed, Dell reported a profit of 21 cents a share, meeting analysts' expectations. 
"Technology is fairly valued," Mr. Murphy said. "And I think the market is telling you that the economy is starting to shape up. With that in mind, you want to own these stocks."
Other technology gainers included Microsoft, up $1.63, at $56.99, and Oracle, which rose 73 cents, to $10.35. 
Among yesterday's losers, Honeywell International dropped $2.09, to $23.16, on concerns about its pension funding. Honeywell said in a government filing that it expected pension expenses next year to be $235 million to $335 million.
Honeywell estimated it would take an after-tax charge of up to $1.7 billion because the value of the pension plan's assets has dropped below its obligation. --------------------

Treasury Prices Drop
(By Reuters)
Treasury prices had their biggest drop in four weeks after an unexpected decline in weekly jobless claims suggested that the economic rebound was accelerating.
Another factor in the price decline was an increase in retail sales, excluding automobiles; that also pointed to faster growth. Demand fell as some investors bought stocks and higher-yielding corporate bonds as a bet that the recovery would bolster companies' earnings.
The reports "contradict the view that the economy is in real bad shape," said Michael Mullaney, who helps manage $10 billion in stocks and bonds at the Fiduciary Trust Company in Boston.
The price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell 1 24/32, to 99 18/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.05 percent from 3.84 percent on Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 2 17/32, to 106 14/32. The yield rose to 4.95 percent from 4.79 percent.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Are Mostly Higher 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Retail sales excluding cars rose in October by 0.7 percent, the most in six months, the Commerce Department reported today. 
 The increase in retail receipts, to $230 billion, came after a 0.1 percent decline in September, the department said. Sales rose at clothing and department stores and building materials outlets. 
 Including cars, sales totaled $301.7 billion, essentially unchanged from $301.6 billion in September. Sales at car dealers dropped 1.9 percent last month after a 5 percent decline in September.
Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa., said the October figures were an indication that the soft spot in the economy was "being put behind us."
The October increase in sales excluding auto dealers was the biggest since a 0.9 percent rise in April. Sales rose 4 percent at clothing and accessory stores, the biggest gain in 10 months after a 1.6 percent decrease in September. Sales increased 1.2 percent at department stores, the largest rise since July 2001. 
Sales at electronics and appliance stores rose 0.1 percent after falling 0.1 percent in September. Gasoline service station sales increased 1.5 percent in October. The average price of gasoline at the pump was $1.49 a gallon, up from $1.44 a gallon in September and August.
Auto sales cooled last month. The sales pace last month, at 15.4 million vehicles, was the slowest since August 1998. 
In a separate report, the Labor Department reported today that imported goods, excluding energy, cost 0.4 percent less last month than they did in October last year. 
Analysts said the decline, for the 19th consecutive month, reflected a global economic slowdown and excess production capacity that is forcing companies to lower prices. 
The Labor Department also reported today that first-time claims for state unemployment insurance fell to 388,000 last week from 396,000. The four-week average dropped below 400,000 for the first time in 10 weeks. Claims in excess of 400,000 indicate a weak job market.

HEADLINE: OPEC Keeping Oil Price Down By Increasing Its Production 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, has sharply increased oil production over the last month to damp high oil prices, which threaten the weak economic recovery and could spike if the United States attacks Iraq, industry and Middle East experts said yesterday.
 OPEC, which accounts for about one-third of the world's oil supply, has reduced exports several times this year, at least on paper, to 21.7 million barrels a day. Oil prices have fallen recently, but for most of the year have remained fairly high, averaging about $25 a barrel. OPEC members have been cashing in by producing far above their official quotas. 
 A recent survey of OPEC and oil industry officials by Platts, an industry newsletter, indicated that OPEC's 10 voting members produced 24.48 million barrels a day in October, an increase of 520,000 barrels a day from September. Iraq, which belongs to OPEC but whose production quotas are set under United Nations sanctions, also increased its output, by about 500,000 barrels a day. All told, more than one million additional barrels a day of oil flowed into global markets at a time when demand was still fairly anemic.
The price of crude oil for December delivery closed at $25.29 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, up 10 cents from the day before. Over the last month, the price of oil for December delivery has declined $4.68 a barrel, or 15.6 percent.
The most obvious explanation for OPEC's barely veiled cheating is that the market has been able to absorb it, keeping prices high. "They were making quite a bit of money without weakening the price until recently," said Leonidas P. Drollas, chief economist for the Center for Global Energy Studies, a London consulting and research firm. "They have been overproducing all year, and they just got greedier."
Many oil traders expect prices to fall even more in the near future because they think the rampant overproduction at OPEC signals the end of the cohesion that permitted the group to manage oil markets over the last three years and keep prices between $20 and $30 a barrel, said George Beranek, manager of market analysis for the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consulting firm.
But Mr. Beranek and other industry analysts said they thought that OPEC's overproduction was, in fact, an example of fairly effective, hands-on market management. The evidence, the analysts said, is that the members have maintained their percentage of output, as established by the official quotas, even as they overproduced, indicating that the increase was coordinated rather than ad hoc. 
Most countries are producing about 10 percent more than their quotas, industry experts said. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, has increased its output the greatest in absolute terms, by more than 800,000 barrels a day above its quota of 7.053 million barrels. The move may be consistent with the Saudi tradition of keeping oil markets well supplied whenever conflict has loomed in the Middle East, said Edward L. Morse, executive adviser at the Hess Energy Trading Company. 
OPEC recognized that inventories of oil in many consuming countries, particularly the United States, were ebbing toward the low end of normal. Then a string of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico in late September and early October shut production at oil wells there, taking 630,000 barrels a day out of the market for about a month. Add to this fears that a war in Iraq would touch off disruptions in the supply of oil from the Middle East, and oil prices rose in mid-September to about $30 a barrel, a level most of OPEC considered uncomfortably high, industry experts said. 
"Given the economic situation and that we're probably heading toward a conflict in the Middle East, OPEC wanted to get the base price of oil down so it wouldn't spike so high if war broke out," said one European oil analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

HEADLINE: Personal Ties Are at Issue in Hospitals' Labor Talks 

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
New York University Hospitals Center has barred its president from participating in strategy sessions or talks involving the hospital's largest union because of her personal relationship with the head of the union, a hospital official said yesterday. 
 Michael Chapman, the hospitals' spokesman, said he would not characterize the relationship between Theresa A. Bischoff, the hospitals' president since 1998, and Dennis Rivera, the president of 1199/S.E.I.U., New York's giant health care union. 
 The decision to bar Ms. Bischoff from participating in talks involving the union comes at a time when the union and hospitals are locked in a bitter battle over efforts to unionize nearly 400 clerical workers. 
Mr. Chapman said the hospitals' leadership asked Ms. Bischoff to withdraw from any talks or strategy sessions involving the union as soon as it received notice that 1199 wanted to organize clerical workers at the hospitals. He said that the hospitals "recognized there might be a potential conflict of interest on this issue." 
He also said that key members of the hospitals' board of trustees were notified of the conflict. 
Mr. Rivera's union represents 35 percent of the hospitals' 4,510 employees. The clerical workers, who would add an additional 8 percent, voted 185 to 164 against joining the union on Oct. 30. But the union has said that it would go to court, if necessary, to contest the election.
Mr. Chapman said Ms. Bischoff had no comment on her relationship with Mr. Rivera. A spokesman for Mr. Rivera also declined to discuss the matter. "If you're asking anything about Dennis and his personal life on the record," said the spokesman, Ken Sunshine, "we are not going to answer, and I'm shocked that you're asking." 
The relationship between the union boss and the hospital executive could be covered by federal labor laws written long before the rise of two-career couples, labor law experts said.
"This is a challenging situation," said Philip Miscimarra, a labor lawyer who is a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, "because there's a federal law which prohibits any employer from giving anything of value directly or indirectly to union representatives." 
Known as the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, it and the related parts of the Landrum-Griffin Act of 1959 were aimed at battling the corruption of that era. "I do not believe Congress in the 1940's and 1950's were thinking of romantic relationships when these laws were passed," Mr. Miscimarra said.
Labor experts mentioned other thorny issues as well. Dr. Peter Capelli, a professor at Wharton, said that current and prospective union members might be entitled to know about the relationship before important votes because of Mr. Rivera's "legal and fiduciary responsibilities" to them.
"You might say this is my private life, the heck with it, except there's all these legal issues underneath," he said. "There's a practical question whether you could keep it separate."
The League of Voluntary Hospitals, an industry association, handles much of the labor negotiations for N.Y.U. Hospitals Center.
But even if Ms. Bischoff steps aside from other dealings involving the union, said Dr. Leo Troy, an economics professor at Rutgers University, people handling the matter still work for her. This "could impair the ability of the hospital to deal at arm's length with the union," he said.
Mr. Chapman, the N.Y.U. spokesman, said that even though Ms. Bischoff formally withdraws from any talks, she supported management in the recent fight over unionizing the clerical workers. "Once the leadership decided we were not in favor of unionization of these 380 hospital workers, Ms. Bischoff supported that decision and made no secret about it," he said.

HEADLINE: Ukraine Protests U.S. Charges on Arms Sales to Iraq, to No Avail 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Ukraine opened a furious counteroffensive this week against American accusations that it had plotted in mid-2000 to subvert a United Nations arms embargo against Iraq, but its arguments appear to leave United States officials unimpressed. 
 Instead, the officials repeated that Ukraine had yet to offer convincing evidence that the arms sales did not occur, and they said officials had yet to reply to a new round of questions from American and British experts that could lay the charges to rest. 
 On Tuesday, a top aide to President Leonid D. Kuchma presented the first detailed response to American accusations, disclosed last month, that Mr. Kuchma had personally approved a plot in mid-2000 to smuggle sophisticated antiaircraft radars to Iraq. 
In a meeting with reporters, Mr. Kuchma's top aide, Viktor Medvedchuk, conceded that the question of selling the radars to Iraq had been broached in "unofficial talks" by the head of the government's arms-export agency. But he said that Ukraine's internal security apparatus had quashed the discussions, and that no sale to Iraq ever took place. 
"This was just the question about the possibility of a sale," Mr. Medvedchuk said. 
"It was at that stage that the security service and the chief intelligence directorate put a stop to the contracts." 
Mr. Medvedchuk also denied a crucial component of the American complaint: that President Kuchma had personally approved the arms sale in a meeting on July 10, 2000, with the government's arms-export director, Valery Malev. 
That charge was based on an American analysis of a clandestine recording smuggled from Ukraine two years ago. The analysis concluded that the recording, on which a voice said to be Mr. Kuchma's ordered Mr. Malev to sell the radars, was genuine. 
Mr. Medvedchuk confirmed on Tuesday that the two men had met on July 10, but he said, "No such talks took place or could have taken place." 
The White House sees Ukraine as a potentially important ally and a bridge in the spread of democratic rule from Europe to central Asia. But relations with Mr. Kuchma, never especially warm, have been all but frozen since American analysts verified the recording in late summer. 
At Mr. Kuchma's invitation, American and British experts visited Ukraine last month to investigate the radar sales. Their still-unreleased report concluded that Ukraine had given only mixed cooperation, and that it had failed to prove the radars were not smuggled to Iraq. 
Reacting to Mr. Medvedchuk's news conference, a senior United States official said Ukraine's denials were unconvincing because the greatest resistance to last month's inquiry came from the highest levels of government. "The people who weren't cooperative were Kuchma's people," the official said.
The air-defense system said to have been sold to Iraq, known as Kolchuga, is a "passive radar" that can track approaching aircraft and vehicles and aim weapons without being detected. Rather than bouncing signals off a target, as with conventional radar, the systems pick up the radio signals emitted by most aircraft and other military vehicles. 
Without elaborating, the American official said the United States had "convincing" evidence such systems are in Iraq, and said analysts had subjected the Kuchma recording to a painstaking analysis.

HEADLINE: HSBC to Buy a U.S. Lender for $14.2 Billion 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
HSBC Holdings, the British banking giant that built its empire in Asia, agreed yesterday to pay $14.2 billion in stock for Household International, the biggest mortgage lender to people with blemished credit histories in the United States.
 The deal is a significant shift in strategy for HSBC, which has typically focused on servicing the very wealthy. Household's biggest business is making home loans at high interest rates to people with poor credit and low incomes, sometimes referred to as the subprime market. 
 For HSBC, the acquisition is part of its effort to increase its consumer lending business and diversify the geographic balance of its earnings so it can be less reliant on finicky markets in Asia and Europe. About a third of HSBC's pretax profits will come from its business in the United States, up from 12 percent, once the acquisition of Household is completed. 
Still, the deal is a risky one. The timing of the transaction is especially unusual given that lending to people with weak credit may be becoming more perilous as the economic recovery falters and personal debt levels continue to rise. 
There are lingering questions, too, about controls and corporate culture at Household. Just last month, the company, which is based in Prospect Heights, Ill., agreed to pay a fine of as much as $484 million to settle charges that it used predatory borrowing practices in more than a dozen states to deceive consumers into paying extraordinarily high interest rates. In August, the company restated nine years of results, saying that it had earned $386 million less than it had previously reported because of a difference of opinion by its new auditors over how to account for its credit card contract. And yesterday, a consumer group said it planned to try to block the deal.
Sir John Bond, HSBC's chairman, brushed aside Household's troubled past yesterday during a news conference, saying, "Our due diligence shows us Household has dealt with this problem effectively."
Indeed, the problems at Household, which was founded in 1878 and has 50 million customers, helped create the opportunity for HSBC to buy the company at a significant discount. In the last year, shares of Household have fallen more than 60 percent, from a 52-week high of $63.25 to $22.46 on Wednesday.
"We see this as a fantastic opportunity to buy a national franchise in America," Sir John said. "The U.S. consumer is the engine room of world growth, and we don't think this subdued period is going to last forever."
Under the terms of the deal, HSBC will exchange 2.675 ordinary shares, or 0.535 American depository share, for each share of Household. Based on Wednesday's closing price, that represents about $30 a share, or a premium of about 34 percent. Yesterday, shares of Household International jumped $5.04, or 22.4 percent, to $27.50. HSBC's American depository receipts dropped $1.85, or 3.3 percent, to $54.20.
HSBC will take a one-time charge to set aside $600 million to $800 million to increase reserves at Household, according to Youssef Nasr, president of HSBC's American operations.
Some industry analysts said they were surprised that HSBC wanted to enter the subprime market, which contrasts sharply with HSBC's highbrow image. "I think of HSBC as a very Presbyterian company -- squeaky clean," said Peter Carroll, managing director at Oliver, Wyman & Company, a financial services consulting firm. "Most banks nowadays are very concerned about what they call 'reputational risk.' "
"There's nothing wrong with subprime lending," he added. "It's just how it is executed."
Citigroup made a similar acquisition in 2000, acquiring the consumer credit firm Associates First. That deal was marred with early problems stemming from lawsuits brought against Citigroup by the Federal Trade Commission soon after the deal closed; those suits accused Associates First of predatory lending practices. Citigroup settled that case for $215 million.
A consumer group, Inner City Press/Community on the Move, said yesterday that it planned to try to block the deal. "Household is well known to be engaged in predatory lending practices," said Matthew Lee, executive director of the organization, an advocate for low-income borrowers based in the Bronx.
Another consumer organization, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, which has filed three lawsuits against Household accusing it of predatory lending, said that it hoped the deal would help it settle the cases. "We are hopeful that a deep-pocketed company like HSBC will be able to resolve these matters quickly and in a way that adequately compensates Household's victims."
HSBC, which was founded as Hongkong Bank in 1865 by Thomas Sutherland, a Scotsman and employee of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, has taken risks before with the acquisitions of companies that needed to be turned around.
The purchase of Marine Midland Bank of the United States and the unrelated acquisition of Midland Bank of Britain fit that mold. But as valuations began to rise, HSBC moved away from the turnaround model, analysts said, and spent lavishly to acquire Republic National Bank of New York, Safra Republic and Credit Commercial de France.
"HSBC used to have a fantastic reputation for doing things on the cheap," James Eden of Commerzbank Securities said. "The Household deal is reminiscent of the old HSBC that we used to know and love."
For Household, the deal will help it lower its financing costs by being able to draw on money from the HSBC deposit base rather than having to tap the credit markets, which would exact a much more expensive price. The company was recently forced to raise nearly $1 billion by selling stock and convertible bonds.
"Basically, this is all about capital," said Mark Alpert, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. "The funding market was becoming very difficult for Household to tap. Their debt costs narrowed somewhat after the stock deal, but they must have felt that given their funding needs for next year, a sale was their best alternative."
As of the end of June, Household had total long- and short-term debt of more than $70 billion. It said that 4.82 percent of its loans from the third quarter are more than 60 days overdue, up from 4.53 percent in the second quarter. William F. Aldinger III, Household's chairman and chief executive, will become the head of HSBC's United States business and is expected to join the board of the parent company.
Moody's Investors Service and Fitch, two ratings agencies, said that they would consider raising Household's credit ratings as a result of the deal.
If the acquisition is not completed, Household has agreed to pay HSBC $550 million under certain conditions. 
The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is acting as Household's adviser on the transaction. HSBC is receiving investment banking advice from Morgan Stanley, Rohatyn Associates L.L.C. and HSBC Investment Bank P.L.C.

HEADLINE: CHANGE IN CHINA: FOREIGN POLICY; 
Hands Across Pacific: U.S.-China Ties Grow

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Friday, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
With its leaders preoccupied by the most sweeping changing of the guard in two decades, China seems determined to improve ties with the United States even if it means accepting, for now, increased American assertiveness worldwide, Chinese and American analysts say.
 China has had enjoyed robust economic growth and spent tens of billions of dollars to modernize its military. But it appears to be less eager today than anytime in the last decade to pick diplomatic fights with the United States, even on issues in its own backyard. 
 The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, united both countries on a common goal -- fighting global terrorism -- and at least temporarily replaced latent fears of an inevitable clash between the Pacific powers with a real and immediate threat, analysts on both sides say. 
China borders several Central Asian nations, including Afghanistan, and has sought and received American help to suppress Islamic radicals it calls terrorists in its own restive region of Xinjiang.
"What is fascinating is that despite all earlier indications, relations have become remarkably stable," said Kurt Campbell a former Pentagon expert on China now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "I have never seen so many strategists on the Chinese side who are openly expressing their comfort with U.S. relations."
Hu Jintao, the new Chinese leader, seems almost certain to pursue the reconciliation in the near term as he focuses on consolidating his power, strengthening the Chinese economy and managing increasingly divisive social issues. 
Beneath the surface some real strains persist. China still feel deeply uncomfortable with Washington's unilateral approach to foreign affairs. It is nervous about the Bush administration's overtures to Taiwan and worried about military deployments in Central Asia.
But the list of common concerns is at least as long. Not just terrorism, but regional security, international crime, weapons proliferation and trade all seem to be more vital issues than they did a few years ago.
In recent weeks China has tacitly agreed to allow the United States to take the lead in figuring out how to dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons program, offering no support to its neighbor and historic Communist ally, analysts said.
Beijing signaled even before France and Russia that it would not oppose a tough United Nations resolution to force weapons inspections in Iraq, helping to erode opposition to a top American priority.
Last month China formally established restrictions on the export of missile technology and goods that could be used to produce chemical or biological weapons, addressing a perennial irritant in relations with Washington.
China's new leadership has also come to power facing enormous economic, environmental, political and social challenges at home. Addressing them will require Western cooperation. Senior officials are unlikely to do anything to risk the huge inflows of capital, on track to reach a record $50 billion this year, that have kept the economy primed even as nearly all of China's Asian neighbors suffer prolonged slowdowns.
"Chinese new leaders realize that they have some very tough issues coming up that will require big expenditures," said Kenneth Lieberthal, a former Clinton administration National Security Council adviser on Asia who is now at the University of Michigan. "There is no way they are going to seek confrontation with the United States."
Some Chinese analysts say China's new attitude in foreign policy reflects a deeper shift in its psychology: a greater self-confidence that asserts itself, paradoxically, as moderation. The confidence stems from tangible diplomatic achievements. China joined the World Trade Organization last year after nearly 15 years of talks. It will play host to the 2008 summer Olympics -- avenging, in China's mind, a bitter defeat in the race for the 2000 Games.
"Especially after Tiananmen Square, China felt as though it was under attack," said a retired Foreign Ministry official who once helped handle relations with the United States. "China does not feel like a victim now."
China has also taken a softer approach to United States relations because its leaders have concluded that belligerence backfired on its most sensitive matter: Taiwan.
Saber-rattling moves to intimidate Taiwan and weaken people who want to make the island an independent nation had the opposite effect there.
The Bush administration changed the American position on defending Taiwan shortly after taking office, vowing that it would respond militarily if China launched an unprovoked attack. Previous administrations declined to say what they would do if war broke out.
The tough line has appeared to work. China has courted lawmakers and businessmen on Taiwan. It has stopped specifying deadlines for reunification and has eagerly promoted economic integration as a gradual solution to political tensions.
It is possible, of course, that China's approach to foreign policy can shift again. While Jiang Zemin may retain behind-the-scenes influence, Mr. Hu, who will assume Mr. Jiang's day-to-day responsibilities, is a blank slate on foreign policy.
When Mr. Hu visited the United States earlier this year, he allowed no light between his own views and those of Mr. Jiang's team. But he showed a nationalist streak in 1999 after the American bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, when he went on television and supported anti-American demonstrations.
Mr. Lierberthal said it was unlikely that new leadership would want to change a policy orientation widely regarded as successful, especially since the new members of the Politburo standing committee have held top-level posts for many years.
"This is not the opposition party coming in from the wilderness," he said.

HEADLINE: Congress Approves Benefits Bills for the Jobless 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
The House and Senate approved separate unemployment benefits bills tonight as lawmakers rushed to get their legislation approved before adjourning the postelection session and heading home for the year.
 The House bill would extend unemployment benefits for people hurt by the economic slowdown. Congress had approved a 13-week extension of unemployment benefits as part of an economic stimulus package it passed earlier this year, but that extension expires on Dec. 31. 
 The House bill would provide for another five weeks of benefits for those who have not yet used up their extension. The intent is to give lawmakers time to return in January and examine the issue further.
The Senate approved by voice vote a bill that would offer an extension through the end of March. It would also allow people who have exhausted their regular 26 weeks of unemployment insurance to qualify for the extension, lawmakers said.
"The House passed a one-month program," said Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma. "This is a three-month program. I happen to think it's a more orderly, more well-thought-out program."
It is unlikely that either the Senate or the House will consider the other chamber's bill before going home for the year.
The House bill also extends a welfare law and restores Medicare payments to doctors.
The welfare provisions would extend the welfare law through March 31 to give lawmakers time to pass legislation renewing it.
Lawmakers have negotiated for months on how best to renew the landmark 1996 bill that overhauled the nation's welfare program. But they remain hung up over issues like whether welfare recipients should be forced to work more hours each week and how much money Washington should send states to help pay for child care.
The bill would also give the government's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services legal protection to fix problems with a Medicare payment formula for how much doctors get paid. Doctors have said the faulty formula has caused them to lose billions of dollars because it is tied to the economy, which is struggling. Many have begun to refuse to accept Medicare patients.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Couple Finds Some Relief After Medical Problems

BYLINE:  By NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON

 BODY:
Mornings have not been kind lately to Victoria K.
 On April 30, she woke up in her Queens home and could not see out of her right eye. Her legs felt heavy, and her right arm was limp. Three months shy of her 36th birthday, Victoria was having a mild stroke. 
 "It was horrible and scary, but when it was happening I couldn't even concentrate on what was going on," she said.
Over the next few days, the facial numbness and paralysis she experienced faded, but the dizzy spells and light sensitivity continued. Her doctors advised her to leave her job as a business consultant. So Victoria, the primary breadwinner for her two sons, 5 and 19, and her husband, 47, went on disability. 
Then, one morning in June, her husband's skin turned yellowish, and he found that he had difficulty walking. He had been complaining of leg pain for months, and his doctors had prescribed arthritis medication. Victoria rushed him to the emergency room at St. Joseph's Hospital in Flushing. There, blood tests and CAT scans added up to something frightening: he had third-stage squamous cell lung cancer. At the time, the family income was $169 a week from disability, down from $800 a week when Victoria was working. And the rent for April, May and June -- $3,627 -- was late. 
"I called up Cancer Care and told them that I couldn't pay the rent and that I didn't know what to do," said Victoria, who, because of all the difficulties she has been through, did not want her full name used. "They told me to get on public assistance, and at that point I was willing to do anything to make sure my husband and children were taken care of." 
Two weeks later a caseworker from the city's Human Resources Administration visited her, and Victoria signed the paperwork needed to file for a one-shot grant to cover her past-due rent.
And then?
"That's when the mess started," Victoria said, "and things went from bad to much, much worse." 
Her husband underwent surgery in July to remove a third of his lung. In the following weeks there were plenty more of those hard mornings. They started with conference calls to her husband's doctors, and ended with long rides back from his sickbed in St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital. All the while, the eviction notices kept coming.
The response from the Human Resources Administration, when it finally arrived, did not make things any easier. Tucked into a bulging purple folder of documents chronicling the family's struggles, a blue piece of paper reads, "Disability income is sufficient to meet family needs." Victoria's case was closed, and her rental assistance claims, she said, had not even been addressed.
Over the next several weeks, Victoria fell into another seemingly fruitless routine. Rounds and rounds of phone calls yielded other people's numbers, shelter recommendations and advice to keep harassing her caseworker.
"I'm the kind of person that takes the bull by the horns," she said. "If there is a way, I will find it. But there was no way. Every door was sealed."
Finally, though, one of those doors opened. Victoria's phone calls eventually led her to the Community Service Society of New York, one of the seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
"What really moved me about her situation was that she'd had a stroke, but she was still advocating for herself and her family, still trying to navigate her way through public assistance," said Natasha Baptiste, a caseworker with the agency's eviction prevention program.
Ms. Baptiste went to work right away to figure out exactly how much Victoria owed, how she could get the money and why her initial request for rental assistance remained unresolved. It was slow going because Victoria's initial application had gotten lost in the system, and according to Victoria and Ms. Baptiste, caseworkers said she needed to reapply. In the meantime, Ms. Baptiste was making calls to other charities so that Victoria, her husband and her sons wouldn't be evicted. 
On Sept. 27, the total amount pledged by various agencies to help the family was about $4,350, about $2,700 of it from Neediest Cases. "Two days later, we got a letter saying that I was approved for rental assistance," Victoria said. "With Ms. Baptiste advocating and me advocating, it still took forever, but she was my angel." 
These days the checks are still coming in, and Victoria's husband is on the mend. Though he still has pain and has been advised by doctors not to push himself, he has returned to work as an operations manager at a livery cab service in Queens.
Victoria's older son, a trained chef, is looking for a job, and her other child, a kindergartner, keeps up a steady commotion riding his bike and playing with his toys. 
Most days, Victoria wears sunglasses because of lingering light sensitivity. She still has dizzy spells, too. But there is much less stress. She is collecting unemployment benefits and has started a nonprofit eviction prevention agency to offer the kind of assistance that Ms. Baptiste and the Community Service Society gave her family.
"I probably have a college education in the system at this point," Victoria said, "and I want to help other people who are in my situation so they won't have to go through what I had to deal with."

HEADLINE: If Higher Rates Loom, Will the Fed Twist? 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
COME on, let's twist again, like we did last century.
 Alan Greenspan this week brought back memories of "Operation Twist," the last time the Federal Reserve he now leads set out to manipulate long-term interest rates. 
 Testifying on Capitol Hill, Mr. Greenspan was reminded that the federal funds rate -- the short-term rate the Fed controls -- is down to 1.25 percent. What could the Fed do if it needed to ease monetary policy when rates were already near zero? 
It could buy long-term Treasuries, the chairman replied. "As a consequence, there's virtually no meaningful limit to what we could inject into the system were that necessary."
Mr. Greenspan gave no hints he was planning to do any such thing. But it is an interesting idea and may come back if the current "soft spot" in the economy, as Mr. Greenspan described it, turns out to be quicksand.
The original Operation Twist was conceived in 1961 by the Kennedy administration, which felt a need to lower long-term rates to stimulate business investment, while at the same time raising short-term rates to deal with a current account deficit that was putting pressure on the dollar. Thus the "twist" on interest rates.
The twist was not wildly successful, but neither was it a clear disaster. The dollar survived another decade before it had to be devalued as the era of fixed exchange rates ended. And a long period of economic growth began in 1961.
But it is not hard to understand why Mr. Greenspan would be thinking about long-term rates. The current economic recovery, choppy and tentative as it is, is dependent on long-term rates' not rising, and it may even need further declines. Since businesses overinvested in the boom and are still looking for ways to cut costs, the housing market has become the engine of growth. Rising home prices make consumers feel wealthier and willing to spend, and refinancing mortgages gives them the cash to do so.
One key to the strength of the housing market is that buyers and sellers of homes look at prices differently. The seller thinks the home sells for, say, $275,000. The buyer focuses on the monthly payment after the down payment: $1,499 on a 30-year, $250,000 loan at 6 percent. In 1990, with 10 percent mortgage rates, that same monthly payment covered a $160,000 loan. A drop of four percentage points has allowed buyers to get a 56 percent larger loan.
Were mortgage rates to rise now, the economic stimulus from refinancings would vanish. Then people with adjustable rate mortgages would have to pay more. Finally, the higher mortgage costs could make so many buyers unable to pay current prices that those prices would fall. And that wealth effect could cause consumers to cut back on spending far more than they did after their stocks lost value.
The aftermath of the bubble can be seen in the disarray of companies like Lucent and in the determination of nearly all companies to control capital spending. This economy needs consumers to keep spending until those imbalances are worked out, and there is no telling how long that will be.
At the moment, consumers are becoming even more important. The federal government can run deficits as it pleases, but state and local governments are being forced to reduce spending and raise taxes. That will apply an economic drag.
The odds still favor the economy's staying out of recession, and there is no obvious reason to expect higher rates any time soon. But it is understandable why the Fed would be nervous. Higher long-term rates could badly damage this economy. Mr. Greenspan could yet be called upon to do the twist.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Interpublic chief seeks a top aide: 'Big company, plenty of things to do, look forward to the help.'

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
WANTED: Executive with extensive finance background to take new post with high risks and high rewards at battered but still leading worldwide agency company. Ownership of high boots and equipment for mucking out stables desirable.
 That's a fitting job description for the new post of chief operating officer at the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York. Interpublic, the world's second-biggest agency company, made the surprising announcement Wednesday that it would create the post for a new executive, who may be in the job as soon as Jan. 1. The executive would serve as second in command to John J. Dooner Jr., the chairman and chief executive, and work with Sean F. Orr, the executive vice president and chief financial officer. 
 Interpublic, which lists among its clients Coca-Cola, General Motors, Nestle and Unilever, has not had a chief operating officer since January 2001, when Mr. Dooner, then also president, was promoted to succeed his longtime mentor, Philip H. Geier Jr., and the post was eliminated.
This time, though, the job is virtually certain to be filled from outside, with the hiring of an executive from an agency not owned by Interpublic. The Madison Avenue rumor mill is already churning out names of potential candidates, but none that could be confirmed yesterday as definitely under consideration.
The search is to be led by Brian J. Brooks, who begins at Interpublic on Monday as executive vice president and chief human resources officer, also a new post. Mr. Brooks had most recently been chief human resources officer at the WPP Group.
In disclosing the decision to hire a chief operating officer, which had been discussed for a couple of months by Mr. Dooner and members of the board, Interpublic gave no reason for creating the post. But it could be deduced by anyone who has followed the recent financial bombs tossed by the company, including revenue shortfalls, losses and liabilities at divisions specializing in tasks like sports marketing; two increases in charges expected from accounting improprieties; and two decreases in expected earnings.
"Very succinctly: big company, plenty of things to do, look forward to the help," Mr. Dooner said yesterday in a telephone interview.
"It's prudent and right to continue to strengthen the company," he added, "and this help will be worthwhile."
Mr. Dooner said he believed that having a No. 2 executive would "let me spend time giving more attention and focus to the professional product and clients." Mr. Dooner's background as the only top executive of a large agency company with agency experience has helped Interpublic agencies land several large assignments even as it struggles to correct its problems.
At the same time, analysts have complained that Mr. Dooner has no financial credentials, unlike two of his principal competitors, Sir Martin Sorrell at WPP and John D. Wren at the Omnicom Group. Yesterday, a day after Interpublic said it would increase the amount of its restatement of earnings over the last five years to $181.3 million -- compared with previous estimates first of $68.5 million and then of $120 million -- Standard & Poor's reiterated that it would keep Interpublic on its Credit Watch with "negative implications."
Shares of Interpublic, which owns agencies like Campbell-Ewald, Draft Worldwide, McCann-Erickson and Mullen, closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.39, up 81 cents, or 6.4 percent, after falling in after-hours trading Wednesday to as low as $10.88. The shares have fallen 54.7 percent this year.
"Essentially, creating the job is a way to placate Wall Street, but it's also a smart move if it lets John focus more on business and clients," said Amy Hoover, vice president at Talent Zoo in Atlanta, an executive recruitment company.
"Bringing in someone who could keep the i's dotted and t's crossed on the financial side would mean a lot to the organization and investors," she added.
Lauren Rich Fine, the advertising analyst for Merrill Lynch, offered a different perspective.
"I'm not sure why you need a chief operating officer for a holding company if you have the right management for the agencies," Ms. Fine said.
On the other hand, "maybe hiring a C.O.O. is a way to say it's just not that easy" for Mr. Dooner to deal with both the company's internal difficulties and external problems stemming from an uncertain economic outlook, Ms. Fine said.
"It's good to have someone else helping when it's tough to say what is and isn't working," she added.
Only one other giant agency company, the Publicis Groupe in Paris, has a chief operating officer. The post there was created just recently as Publicis acquired the Bcom3 Group and named Roger Haupt, who had been chairman and chief executive at Bcom3, as president and chief operating officer. The creation of the post was perceived as a signal by Maurice Levy, chairman and chief executive at Publicis, to encourage senior Bcom3 managers to remain after the acquisition.
At WPP, based in London, Sir Martin is chairman and chief executive, without a designated second in command. At Omnicom, based in New York, the top two posts are divided between Bruce Crawford, the chairman, and Mr. Wren, the chief executive. (Omnicom received a Warren Buffett Seal of Approval yesterday when the Geico Corporation division of his company, Berkshire Hathaway, reported new stakes in Omnicom and two nonadvertising companies.)
Interpublic ought to "break the mold," said Catherine St. Jean, chief operating officer at Judy Wald Partners in New York, an executive search firm specializing in filling creative posts. It should hire someone from outside the industry, not only from outside Interpublic, because "they need balance and really, really fresh blood," she said.
"IPG has always been an old boys' network," Ms. St. Jean said, using the stock ticker symbol to refer to Interpublic, "and there has been too much inbreeding, too much buddy-buddy behavior, which leads to too much trust."
"One day you wake up," she added, "and the quicksand is not at your ankles; it's in your ears."
Wherever executives come from and however the executive suites are organized, "no one has come up with a vision for these times," said Susan Friedman, president at Susan Friedman Ltd. in New York, a leading executive recruiter for agencies. 
"The business has changed so completely," she added, "but there's no overall big plan about how to pull everything together to make this all work well."
That said, Ms. Friedman described the hiring of a chief operating officer at Interpublic as a good idea if it helped Mr. Dooner concentrate on "advertising, which he's terrific at and is what he should be doing."
One incentive for someone to agree to the daunting challenge of joining Interpublic in such a highly visible post at so tumultuous a moment in its corporate history is -- what else? -- money.
The salary for the new No. 2 job is expected to range between Mr. Orr's and Mr. Dooner's. Mr. Orr's salary last year was $600,000, according to Interpublic, and Mr. Dooner's was $1.25 million.

HEADLINE: Anti-Abortion Lawmakers Kill House Bankruptcy Bill 

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
A long-stalled, industry-sponsored bill to make it harder for people to erase their debts by filing for bankruptcy appeared to die in the House today, in what lawmakers saw as an embarrassing miscalculation by the newly installed House Republican leadership of the influence of anti-abortion lawmakers within their party.
 The bill, which was championed by credit card companies, banks and retailers, was rejected on a procedural vote of 243 to 172, with 87 Republicans turning against their party's leadership and the White House to oppose the bill. President Bush had vowed to sign the measure if it reached his desk. 
 The Republican opposition was led by conservative, anti-abortion lawmakers who said a provision of the bill would have unfairly punished anti-abortion activists by restricting their ability to use the bankruptcy courts to write off court fines. 
"I love my party, but I don't think I should have to sacrifice my core convictions to be in good standing," said Representative Christopher H. Smith, a New Jersey Republican who is an outspoken anti-abortion advocate and led the opposition.
Lawmakers said there was still a slight chance that the bill, stripped of the abortion provision to allow for easy passage, would be brought up again for a vote in the final hours before the House shuts down this week, ending its session for the year. Without the provision, the bill would face certain defeat in the Senate.
Most Democratic opponents had described the bill as too tough on low- and middle-income consumers, especially during a national economic downturn, and a similar bill was vetoed by President Bill Clinton.
The measure rejected today in the House would have resulted in the largest overhaul of the federal bankruptcy law in a generation, with many people forced to pay off at least part of their debt after declaring bankruptcy.
The House vote infuriated business and banking lobbyists who have spent years pushing for such a bill, which they say would end abuses of the bankruptcy system by high-income debtors.
Several prominent business lobbyists said they had been assured by Republican leaders this week that the measure would be adopted by a large margin, since many lawmakers might find it easier to overlook the abortion provision after the passions of the election had cooled.
Only hours before the House vote today, the Democratic majority leader, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, a supporter of the bill, predicted easy Senate passage next week.
"I have never been as disappointed in a vote as this one," said Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation. "I can't recall a single piece of legislation our industry worked so hard on to have it go down in defeat."
Republican Congressional aides said that it appeared the House Republican leadership team had badly misjudged the degree of opposition created by the abortion-rights provision, which was not part of the original House bill but was inserted at the insistence of Senate Democrats during a House-Senate conference committee.
The aides said the vote today had created bitterness among conservative Republicans who were forced by their leaders to choose between two powerful, traditionally Republican constituencies, the business community and anti-abortion groups.
"This vote shows some real mettle on the part of pro-life members of the House who put principal above party," Mr. Smith said. 
The vote came only a day after House Republicans elected their new leadership team, with Representative Tom DeLay of Texas promoted to majority leader and Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, his chief deputy, succeeding him as House whip. Representative J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois remained as speaker.
Mr. Hastert's spokesman, John Feehery, said Republican leaders had believed that they had the votes to pass the bill. "We thought we had a good shot at getting this," Mr. Feehery said. "I don't think anybody is really embarrassed. We all knew that there was trouble on the horizon."
He and other Republican spokesmen singled out Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the Democratic author of the abortion-rights provision, as the lawmaker who was ultimately responsible for the collapse of the bill. "Schumer really was pretty obnoxious about how this provision was going to hurt people who were pro-life and that really got some of our folks ginned up," Mr. Feehery said.
Mr. Schumer fired back today, noting that his provision was a compromise reached with, among others, Representative Henry J. Hyde, an Illinois Republican who was a member of the conference committee and a well-known abortion opponent. "There is no reason a bill like this can't pass except for some very extreme people who misread the law," Mr. Schumer said.
The ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, said that the vote today "was a stunning but deserved rebuke to the House G.O.P. leadership and a victory for consumers, working Americans, women and children."

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook; 
Inside the Saudi Royal Cocoon

BYLINE:  By PHILIP TAUBMAN 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
It was like a silent movie. Crown Prince Abdullah, cloaked in regal yellow, was seated at a large desk, peering at a set of papers resting on a small wooden platform. Periodically he waved an aide to his side for whispered consultations. Several dozen other men assembled in the sunny room stood at attention. The only motion was an occasional flutter of the pencil in the crown prince's right hand as he made a notation. 
 The scene struck me as an example of the gap between the antiquated governing structures of Saudi Arabia and the very modern economic and social challenges the country faces. There are not many real monarchies left. Most royal courts long ago relinquished their power to civilian governments and now serve mostly to honor tradition and attract tourists. But in Saudi Arabia the royal family runs the country, commands the military, sets economic and foreign policies and deals with its subjects in the manner of the kings and queens of a bygone era. 
 Crown Prince Abdullah is by all accounts a thoughtful, uncorrupted ruler, and the foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, has a sophisticated understanding of international issues. Yet even they seem to operate in a world so distorted by sycophancy that it would be a miracle if they could see the full dimensions of the problems Saudi Arabia faces. Obsequiousness oozes through the Saudi court like oil.
Before the crown prince handled his paperwork, a small group of American and British journalists who had been invited to attend the session were afforded a brief audience with Prince Miteb, the crown prince's son and head of the military forces in the National Guard. To get the conversation started, a worldly Saudi official who had talked candidly with me about the country's problems a few days earlier turned to the prince and said earnestly, "Your Royal Highness, I thought it might be interesting to discuss the role younger members of the royal family play in Saudi life." 
Prince Miteb nodded and explained that while he might prefer to sleep late, travel abroad and go shopping, he recognized that as a member of the royal family he had an obligation to serve his people. A few minutes later, when we had moved across the National Guard complex to the crown prince's meeting room, Prince Miteb shot out of his seat like a cannonball when summoned by his father to his side.
Aides to Crown Prince Abdullah treated the journalists graciously, but they clearly thought of us as a mob that might upend the choreographed event at any moment. Discussions about conversing with the crown prince had gone on for days, with different advisers offering guidance that changed hourly. In the end, no questions were permitted. When Christiane Amanpour of CNN politely broke the ban, Abdullah waved her away as though she were a mosquito.
Fawning aides are hardly unique to Saudi Arabia. The White House has sometimes served as a protective bunker for presidents who were cut off from the country and surrounded by servile advisers. But the multiple layers that insulate the Saudi royal family make the White House look as open as the bleachers at Yankee Stadium. PHILIP TAUBMAN

HEADLINE: THE MAYOR'S BUDGET PLAN: COMMUTERS; 
For Those Who Come From Elsewhere, New York Income Tax Is a Hard Sell

BYLINE:  By RICHARD LEZIN JONES

DATELINE: HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON, N.Y., Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Amanda Dargan sympathizes with New York City's financial pain. Really, she does. The former Queens resident's affection for the five boroughs has continued to burn brightly even since her move to Westchester County. But the idea that she and others who commute to the city from around the region should now pay a hefty income tax, well, that's something else entirely.
 "We have a real love for the city," said Mrs. Dargan, 52, as she began her morning trip to her job at a Manhattan nonprofit agency. "And we know the city is hurting and we wouldn't mind paying something. But what the mayor is proposing is very, very hard. There's this image that everyone in Westchester or New Jersey or Long Island who commutes is wealthy and can afford anything, but it's going to be a real strain. A lot of people are going to think twice about commuting in." 
 On trains and commuter buses this morning, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposed extension of the city's income tax to commuters was a very hard sell. Many were willing to have part of their salary deducted to help the city, as it was under the commuter tax phased out three years ago. But few thought a new tax six times as much as the old one -- on top of the hefty property taxes most pay at home -- was something even remotely fair.
Besides the commuters themselves, elected officials in the states whose suburbs pour about 800,000 residents a day into New York City also criticized the plan, and the governors of New Jersey and Connecticut expressed their opposition.
Officials weighed the legality of such a tax, and some said they might consider reciprocal taxes focusing on people who commute from New York City, if Mr. Bloomberg's measure passed. And a few mayors and county executives, many of whom noted that they, too, were facing budget problems, said that the tax would be a setback in regional relations and cooperation. 
"The commuter tax would destroy our unity and our resolve to rebuild the region and to work constructively," said New Jersey's governor, James E. McGreevey, who in May abandoned his own proposal to impose a commuter tax on Pennsylvanians who work in his state. He added that passage of the tax might prompt a lawsuit by his state. "To promote economic development, we need strong, clear leadership as opposed to feudal tax policy, which pits city against state," he said.
Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut also denounced the proposal. "It raises legal arguments and starts a rat's nest of retaliation across state lines," said Mr. Rowland's chief of staff, Dean Pagani.
Commuters and public officials alike wondered whether the tax would lead to an exodus of businesses and jobs from the city and ultimately end up doing harm.
But even as those around the region considered the implications of the plan, many were dubious about the chances of such a tax passing the New York State Legislature.
Under the mayor's plan, up to 2.7 percent of the income of suburban commuters would be taxed, as much as six times the 0.45 percent rate of the commuter tax that was repealed in 1999. Because many of the legislators who eliminated that tax are still in office, the prospects of Mayor Bloomberg's proposal being passed seemed dim.
For that reason, some questioned whether the introduction of the tax proposal was little more than a bit of political gamesmanship by Mr. Bloomberg.
Jeffrey Spencer, 38, a financial technology consultant from Flemington, N.J., was incredulous. "He wants to give the people in New York City a tax break at our expense? Come on, that's definitely playing politics."
Still, no matter how remote the chance that the tax plan will be approved, many in the suburbs said they were troubled that city leaders might even consider such a tax.
"It's taxation without representation," said Dan Bergeron, 43, of Redding, Conn., as he waited for a train to Manhattan in Wilton. "We do New York State taxes now that get allocated to the city. Let us vote for the next mayor if we're going to pay the taxes."
Some noted that with barely manageable suburban property taxes in some communities, any additional deductions by New York would place an excessive burden on commuters.
"We pay enough taxes," said Larry Stevens, 46, a lawyer who lives in Long Beach, N.Y. "The property taxes here are already going up 20 percent. Let them get more state aid."
Not too far away from Mr. Stevens on the platform of the Island Park station in Nassau County stood Marcel Lerner, a 79-year-old jeweler who was one of the few suburbanites to support the mayor's plan.
"I'm for it for a very good reason: you have to get the money from somewhere," he said. "Everybody has to pitch in. I go to New York so often I feel I should do something."
Christopher Norfleet, a 45-year-old construction consultant from Wilton, said: "The city probably needs the money, but they should find another way to get it. I don't think anybody would want to pay more. A rise in the stock market would be nice."
Then he playfully offered a suggestion.
"Actually," he said, "a donation from Mr. Bloomberg would be nice."

HEADLINE: Pelosi Easily Wins Election for House Democratic Leader 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
House Democrats turned to Representative Nancy Pelosi of California today to try to reverse their political fortunes, electing her their leader. She becomes the first woman to head a party in either house of Congress.
 As she left the closed meeting where she had easily dispatched a challenger, Ms. Pelosi was exultant. But she acknowledged the task she faces leading a caucus that lost seats in the elections last week and confronting an emboldened and determined Republican majority. 
 "We have a big job to do," she said as she stood with Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader since 1995, who stepped down after failing to win back the House on his fourth attempt. "We're ready for it, and we're getting ready for victory."
Ms. Pelosi, 62, said she had not sought the position to make a statement on behalf of women but appreciated the significance of her election nonetheless.
"I ran, again, as a seasoned politician and experienced legislator," said the congresswoman, a member of the House since 1987 who was elected last year to her caucus's No. 2 position, that of minority whip. "It just so happens that I am a woman, and we have been waiting a long time for this moment."
Ms. Pelosi has a solidly liberal record, and some opponents had expressed concern that a victory by her would be viewed as a leftward turn for the party. But she received strong support from the caucus today, defeating Representative Harold E. Ford Jr. of Tennessee by a vote of 177 to 29. A last-minute challenger, Representative Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, who announced her candidacy only Wednesday, withdrew before the voting.
House Democrats also elected Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, a seasoned veteran with leadership experience, as their whip and picked Representative Robert Menendez of New Jersey as caucus chairman. Mr. Menendez defeated Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut by one vote, giving the Hispanic Caucus a member among the leadership.
Republicans are eager to contrast their positions with those of Ms. Pelosi, who voted against President Bush's tax cuts and helped lead House Democratic opposition to the resolution authorizing his use of force against Iraq. But the House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, who is retiring from Congress, said Ms. Pelosi should not be underestimated.
"I think she represents her party better than people who feel the need to pretend to be not of their party's values," Mr. Armey said. "She's a decent, hard-working person. I think she's got more ability than people recognize. "
There are already indications that Ms. Pelosi's new role may be influencing her positions on issues. Though she was previously a leading opponent of the Republican measure to create a Department of Homeland Security, on Wednesday night she voted for it, unlike most other House Democrats.
"It was time to move on," she said. "All the Democrats and Republicans want homeland security. Chapter and verse of any one bill does not define that."
Running against Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Ford, a 32-year-old considered a potential Democratic star, drew most of his public backing from members of a moderate group known as the Blue Dog Coalition. He and Representative Martin Frost of Texas, who dropped out of the running last week, expressed fears during the race that Ms. Pelosi would move the party to the left and perhaps cause some conservative Democrats to defect.
On Wednesday, in an effort to mollify the moderate wing, Ms. Pelosi named Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, a fiscal conservative with a background in budget and military issues, as her choice for assistant to the leader.
Mr. Gephardt today praised his successor, saying she "won this on her merit and her leadership capability." 
She also won in a traditional way, raising large sums of money during the 2002 campaign and contributing it to House candidates in the expectation that her generosity would be rewarded. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, campaign reports through September showed that Ms. Pelosi had donated more than $1 million from her personal campaign account and leadership committee to various candidates, making her No. 1 in that category, just ahead of Representative Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas, who was elected House majority leader on Wednesday.
The new minority whip, Mr. Hoyer, pointed to the diversity of the new Democratic leadership team. In addition to a woman and a Latino, that team includes Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, who was elected vice chairman of the Democratic caucus, its fourth-ranking official. Mr. Hoyer said that "House Democrats reflect America."
In a meeting with reporters, Ms. Pelosi would not be drawn into comparing herself with the Republican leaders of the new Congress. 
"What the Democrats will do, working together, is to build consensus around an economic growth message, and that will be right down the center," she said. "So it's not about contrast right to left, it's about a message for economic growth."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: BIPARTISAN HAWKS; 
New Group Will Lobby For Change In Iraqi Rule

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Seeking to increase domestic and international support for a new government in Iraq, an independent bipartisan group has been formed with the White House's tacit approval to press for the ouster of Saddam Hussein.
 Members of the hawkish group, the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq, include former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, former Senator Bob Kerrey, the Teamsters leader James P. Hoffa and the former House speaker, Newt Gingrich. Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, are expected to be the group's hononary Congressional co-chairmen. 
 The committee is modeled on a successful lobbying campaign to expand the NATO alliance, and will engage in advocacy and educational efforts in the United States and Europe aimed at "freeing the Iraqi people from tyranny," the group's mission statement says.
On Friday, members are to meet at the White House with Condoleezza Rice, President Bush's national security adviser, to encourage a long-term American commitment to developing democratic institutions in Iraq after Mr. Hussein is gone -- whether as a result of a coup or an American-led military offensive.
"We don't believe in hit-and-run interventionism," said Bruce Jackson, the Reagan-era Pentagon official who is the committee's chairman. 
Operating from a row-house office near Capitol Hill on less than $25,000 in seed money from Mr. Jackson and Julie Finley, a Republican fund-raiser, the committee plans to borrow many of the same low-budget methods used in the NATO enlargement campaign to spread its message. Those will include making contact with journalists, holding dinner sessions with administration officials and meeting with editorial boards. 
With United Nations weapons inspectors expected to arrive soon in Iraq, committee organizers say they fear public support for removing Mr. Hussein and rebuilding Iraq's political and economic institutions could slip without steady pressure. 
"Support is never as deep as you'd like it," said Randy Scheunemann, the group's president and a former aide to Republican senators Bob Dole and Trent Lott. "We're looking at getting outside of Washington, from Spokane to Wichita." 
Mr. Scheunemann said committee members would also give the administration "a gut check" on its Iraq policies, especially on evolving a plan for governing a post-Hussein Iraq. 
Some committee members were critical of the administration's handling of the disparate Iraqi opposition groups. "I am disappointed we haven't done more with the opposition groups earlier, not just militarily but politically," said Wayne A. Downing, a retired Army general who was until recently Mr. Bush's principal adviser on terrorism. 
Senator Kerrey, a former Nebraska Democrat who is now president of the New School University in Manhattan, said ousting Mr. Hussein would benefit Iraq's long oppressed citizenry. "There is a moral case for this beyond just the political arguments," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MAYOR'S BUDGET PLAN: OVERVIEW; 
MAYOR URGES PLAN FOR DRASTIC CUTS AND TAX INCREASES

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg outlined his plan yesterday to pull New York City through its worst fiscal crisis since the 1970's by raising taxes significantly while simultaneously cutting the size of the police force, closing fire companies, reducing new day care slots for children and shutting centers for the elderly.
 With the city's coffers drained by the stagnant economy, the aftershocks from the attack on the World Trade Center and the unsustainable spending levels of recent years, Mr. Bloomberg called for immediate action -- including a 25 percent property tax increase and $844 million reduction in services -- to close a gap of $1.1 billion in the current fiscal year's budget. 
 And the mayor said he expected the shortfall to balloon to $6.4 billion in the fiscal year that begins on July 1. He proposed reorganizing the city's personal income tax in a way that shifts the burden from city residents to workers who commute from outside the city. 
The City Council, which is being asked to approve the property tax increase before the January bills are sent out, is already questioning its size. And state lawmakers, who would have to vote on the mayor's income tax proposal for the next fiscal year, say it will be a tough sell. It is six times the size of the commuter tax that legislators repealed in 1999. But Mr. Bloomberg said the alternatives to higher taxes on commuters and real estate were even deeper cuts that could affect core services. 
Mr. Bloomberg took pains to reassure New Yorkers that the city was in fundamentally better shape than it was during the 1970's, when it laid off tens of thousands of workers and nearly went bankrupt. And he vowed not to let service cuts endanger public safety, harm instruction in the schools or lead to dirtier streets.
"This city is not going to cut its expenses below where the quality of life would start to deteriorate," Mr. Bloomberg said as he gave a businesslike PowerPoint presentation of his budget plan at City Hall, noting that crime and welfare rolls continued to decline in the city. "Squeegee guys are not going to come back in this city," he said.
Over the next year and a half, the plan calls for raising taxes by roughly $4.4 billion and for cutting services by nearly $2 billion.
The plan will put the mayor's oft-repeated pledge to manage better with less to the test. The cuts would reduce the number of police officers in all ranks to 37,210, the lowest level in years; eliminate some ambulance shifts; and close eight fire companies. But Mr. Bloomberg spared the Police, Fire and Education Departments from the full brunt of the 7.5 percent to 9.5 percent cuts that he originally sought. 
A plan to add 5,000 slots at children's day care centers is now expected to be scaled back to less than 2,000, and 30 centers for the elderly will be closed while the remaining 310 reduce the number of days they are open. 
The mayor's plan calls for reducing the city's work force by 8,000 positions by June 2004, mostly through attrition but also through several hundred layoffs.
To close this fiscal year's $1.1 billion gap, and to get an $800 million head start on next year's deficit, Mr. Bloomberg wants a 25 percent property tax increase in January, which would yield $1.1 billion, along with the $844 million in service cuts. 
One of the cornerstones of Mr. Bloomberg's plan for next year is his call for a major reorganization of taxes. The mayor wants to lower income taxes on city residents to offset their higher property tax bills, but to charge the same city income tax rates to people who work in the city but live elsewhere. If this plan were to go through, some tax analysts say, the net effect could be lower overall taxes for many New York City residents. Even with the lower tax on city residents, taxing commuters would net the city $1 billion more. 
Mr. Bloomberg wants to close next year's $6.4 billion gap with the $1 billion in income taxes from commuters; $2.3 billion from the higher property taxes; the $800 million surplus from the end of this fiscal year; $1.1 billion in cuts in city agencies; and $1.2 billion in actions requiring the approval of the state and federal governments and the city's labor unions.
Leaders of the City Council said they would like to negotiate the size of the property tax increase and the exact nature of the spending cuts. Gifford Miller, the Council speaker, said that the Council was concerned that a 25 percent increase in the property tax was too high, but acknowledged that some increase was needed.
"I'd love to tell you that we don't need one," he said of the property tax at a breakfast for business leaders. "I can't. The property tax is the only tax that we have local control over, and given the situation and the scope of the problems that we're in, some increase is necessary. The Council will certainly try and make every effort to keep that increase as low as possible, do it once, and then freeze the rate. Because businesses and residents deserve to know with certainty where we're going."
Leaders in Albany reacted cautiously to Mayor Bloomberg's proposal to lower the city's income tax while taxing commuters.
Gov. George E. Pataki is on vacation, and his aides said that he was studying the mayor's proposal. But in his recent re-election campaign he pledged not to restore a commuter tax of 0.45 percent that was repealed in 1999. The city's proposal would tax commuters at the new city rates; the top rate is 2.7 percent.
Some members of the Assembly held open the possibility that it could pass their house, noting that they could get enough votes from New York City lawmakers so they would not have to count on members from the suburbs. And while aides to the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said he was still exploring it, several Republicans in the Senate said that they thought it had no chance of passage. "I think it's dead on arrival," said Senator John J. Bonacic, a Republican from New Paltz.
Mr. Bloomberg stressed that he was simply seeking to bring the city's income taxes in line with the state's, which charge nonresidents. And he noted that many municipalities with income taxes tax nonresidents.
"As a matter of fact, it is the general policy throughout this country for municipalities that have income taxes to charge nonresidents, not just at the state level but at the city level," he said. "Cities like Los Angeles, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Daytona, St. Louis, Newark, Kansas City, San Francisco, Yonkers, all tax nonresidents the same ways they do residents. Yonkers is a bit less. All of the others I listed tax exactly the same rate for nonresidents as residents."
The mayor is also seeking concessions from the unions to have city employees work longer hours, or get the flexibility to have workers change jobs or find other so-called productivity savings, for a savings of $600 million a year. To do so, Mr. Bloomberg pledged to end the city's current practice of waiting to negotiate contracts until near the end of their term, or after they expire, and giving workers retroactive raises.
"You can't do productivity enhancements retrospectively," he said. "It just can't be done. So you have to have a policy going forward where we are not going to go and wait two years till a contract expires and then negotiate. We're going to have to say, 'You don't get any raises for a period that's already past.' "
Mr. Bloomberg, who made his fortune with a financial information company, had a battery of graphs and figures to show how the city got into its current position. One showed the 132,000 jobs it has lost since the end of 2000. Others showed the slumping stock market, which has driven down Wall Street profits and capital gains taxes to less than half of what they were in 2000.
The toll on the city is serious. While property taxes continue to climb, the city's nonproperty taxes are now projected to fall two years in a row for the first time in more than a decade. The last time that happened, in 1990-1991, the cumulative decline was 4.7 percent. This time, the mayor said, the cumulative decline is expected to total 12 percent.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE COSTS; 
House Votes to Help Insure Terror Losses

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
After a strong final push by President Bush, the House last night adopted legislation providing up to $100 billion in support to the insurance industry for future terrorist attacks. The White House and senators from both parties said passage in the Senate seemed likely.
 "We'll have a strong vote for the bill," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, an early advocate of assistance to insurers after the World Trade Center attack more than a year ago. 
 The measure was approved in the House on a voice vote. 
Under the legislation, the government would pay 90 percent of the cost of a terrorist attack after losses were more than $10 billion. For lesser damages, during the first year of the three-year program, insurance companies would pay up to the equivalent of 7 percent of their premiums for damages with the government picking up the rest of the expenses. By the third year, the insurers' share would rise to 15 percent of their premiums. In that year, the government would pay 90 percent of losses greater than $15 billion.
Any losses paid by the government under $10 billion would be recouped by imposing a surcharge of up to 3 percent on premiums paid by businesses. But there is no provision for repaying the government for larger losses.
The insurers were pleased. "It's wonderful to see this bill moving," said Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman for the American Insurance Association, a trade group that has been pressing for government assistance. "We hope the Senate finishes the job quickly."
An aide to Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who was also an early supporter of the legislation, said Mr. Gramm thought the latest version of the bill was far too generous to insurance companies.
Several times the legislation had seemed close to passing, but it was repeatedly stalled by House Republicans who insisted that businesses be spared from punitive damages in lawsuits that might stem from an attack. The White House at first also opposed such lawsuits, but reached a compromise in October with Senate Democrats. Democrats argued that the threat of lawsuits would be an incentive to businesses to make every effort to prevent an attack.
Over breakfast at the White House on Wednesday with Republican leaders and Senator Tom Daschle, the departing Senate majority leader, President Bush "made clear he wanted the bill," a senior White House official said.
"It's clearly not a perfect bill," the White House official said. "The president wanted more legal reforms. But the deal we got is far better than current law."
Under the bill, victims of terrorist attacks would be permitted to sue most businesses. But insurance companies and the federal government would be exempt, and cases would have to be consolidated in a single federal court to prevent lawyers from seeking jurisdictions that they believed favored their position.
Representative J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois and speaker of the House, and F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who leads the House Judiciary Committee, continued to have reservations. But after a phone conversation late Wednesday with the president, Mr. Hastert came around. "The speaker got assurances that the president would work with him to enact further tort reform in the next Congress," said John Feehery, a spokesman for Mr. Hastert.
Terrorism insurance had been provided free with commercial coverage before the September 2001 attacks. Afterward, the coverage was withdrawn for most big businesses, though a few companies began offering limited terrorism coverage at very high prices.
President Bush, armed with data supplied by trade groups representing banks, real estate companies and insurers, said the lack of full terrorism coverage at affordable prices was slowing the nation's economic recovery. 
Mr. Bush said hundreds of thousands of Americans were out of work because investors had been unable to obtain terrorism coverage for new construction projects. Real estate organizations said the sale of skyscrapers in New York and other cities had slowed because of complications over insurance. Bond rating agencies also lowered credit ratings on some office towers and hotels that were judged to have inadequate coverage.
But some insurance experts and economists said terrorism insurance was only one of several reasons why many construction projects and real estate transactions had stalled. Overall, they said, the impact of the insurance issue had been felt most in the big cities.
Over the last year, Mr. Bush made passage of the insurance legislation a recurring theme, and he emphasized it again as he campaigned around the country before the Nov. 5 election. "The president has felt all along that this was a jobs bill," the White House official said.
Senator Dodd and Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said they thought the bill, which would require all commercial insurers to make terrorism coverage available, was important to the economy. For once they found themselves siding with the president.
"Without his help," Mr. Dodd said of Mr. Bush, "this bill would not have happened."

HEADLINE: CHANGE IN CHINA: THE TRANSITION; 
CHINA CARRIES OUT AN ORDERLY SHIFT OF ITS LEADERSHIP

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Friday, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Hu Jintao, a 59-year-old insider known as brilliant and bland, was named chief of the Communist Party today, the point man in a sweeping generational shift of the nation's leadership that was achieved through the most orderly transition in the 81-year history of the party.
 In what has become a national ritual to reveal the new leaders -- who were selected by a small group in total secrecy -- Mr. Hu and the eight other members of an expanded ruling council strode before reporters and a national television audience late this morning. 
 "We will certainly uphold the great trust that the party has placed in us, and the expectations of all the country's people," Mr. Hu promised in a brief inaugural address. 
Looking poised but slightly tense, Mr. Hu pledged continuity with the policies of Jiang Zemin, whose drive to broaden the party and overhaul the economy while keeping a tight lid on politics were endorsed by the just-ended 16th Party Congress. 
Mr. Hu was formally elected to the top spot this morning at a pro-forma meeting of the newly appointed Central Committee. 
The new Standing Committee of the Politburo, which effectively rules the nation, was also formally appointed this morning, with its membership rising to nine from seven. 
To the surprise of many observers, Wu Bangguo, who has had a modest profile as a deputy prime minister directing the reform of state enterprises and is a protege of Jiang Zemin, was given No. 2 ranking in the party elite.
Four other men seen as close allies to Mr. Jiang were also appointed to the inner circle. 
Mr. Jiang will remain state president until the Parliament meets in March, when Mr. Hu is expected to take over that title as well. Whether Mr. Jiang will give up his third post, chairman of the military, is unclear.
Mr. Hu takes over a country experiencing dazzling economic and social change, one that is taking a more confident place in world affairs. But he must also cope with official corruption, spreading unemployment, a widening gap between rich and poor and bubbling demands for political change.
The turnover in leading party councils this week is enormous, largely thanks to a recent, unwritten rule that officials older than 70 should step down. This does not, however, portend equally striking changes in policy.
Judging by their records, Mr. Hu and his colleagues are likely to proceed cautiously and in unison, with the expanded size of the Standing Committee making radical shifts harder than ever to achieve. 
China seeks friendly ties with the United States, expanding economic and technological relations while trying to contain serious differences over Taiwan and human rights. Just Thursday, for example, NATO officials revealed that China had requested a "dialogue," the first contact of any sort in the 53-year history of the American-dominated alliance.
China and the United States have moved closer over the past year in part because of shared interests in combating terrorism.
The country's top priority remains building an advanced market economy, exemplified by China's recent entry into the World Trade Organization, seen here as a risky but necessary step to force the economy to become more competitive.
On paper, the turnover at the top is nearly total. Apart from Mr. Hu, the six other members of the outgoing Standing Committee all are giving up their party posts. These include Li Peng, 74, the former prime minister and the conservative current head of the Parliament, and Zhu Rongji, 74, the prime minister and a prime architect of China's economic success.
Change is also sweeping through the 22-member Politburo and the larger Central Committee. Of 21 members in the outgoing Politburo, two-thirds have retired. The new Politburo of 24 includes just one woman, Wu Yi, known for her role in negotiating China's entry to the World Trade Organization, and two army generals.
Half the 356 voting and alternate members of the just-selected Central Committee are new to that policy body, whose membership indicates the leaders of the future. Most of the new members are in their 50's and they include some younger military officers and a few corporate heads of state industries, though it did not appear that any private entrepreneurs had gained entry. 
In general, those now moving into senior positions are younger and better educated than their predecessors, and many have advanced as economic technocrats.
Mr. Jiang's retirement from the new Central Committee scotched months of speculation that he might try to remain in office. But he leaves in triumph and with indications that he may exert considerable influence behind the scenes.
In their final acts on Thursday, the 2,114 delegates voted unanimously for resolutions praising Mr. Jiang's 13-year tenure and putting his "important thought of the Three Represents" into the party constitution alongside the theories of Mao and Deng Xiaoping.
Mr. Jiang's contribution, an effort by the increasingly detached ruling party to reinvent itself in all but name, asserts that the party can represent "advanced forces" like entrepreneurs and, indeed, all of society as it continues to be the vanguard of the working class and peasants. Its untested premise is that the party can maintain its monopoly by incorporating dynamic new groups into the ruling circle.
Beyond the hosannas, Mr. Jiang has placed many associates in senior positions. In addition to Mr. Wu, the new No. 2, these include Zeng Qinghong, 63, a shrewd strategist and bureaucratic infighter who has been Mr. Jiang's close aide and now enters the ruling circle on his own and the recent party secretaries of Beijing and Shanghai.
Another entrant into the inner circle is Wen Jiabao, 60, who has been a respected deputy of Zhu Rongji and will probably be named prime minister in March.
From his new party ranking, it appears likely that Wu Bangguo will take over the National People's Congress, or Parliament, next March.
Speculation continues about whether Mr. Jiang will retain his title as chairman of the military, following in the pattern of Deng. An intense campaign in praise of Mr. Jiang in military publications and speeches over recent months suggested that the army brass wants him to stay.
But all the top generals over 70 were retired from the Politburo and Central Committee this week, an indication that the retirement norm is being enforced in the military as well. This makes it harder to justify the elderly Mr. Jiang staying on as military chairman, some experts believe.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ANTITERRORISM; 
Little Headway In Terror War, Democrats Say

BYLINE:  By DAVID JOHNSTON and ERIC LICHTBLAU 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
American intelligence agencies came under renewed attack in Congress today for failing to find Osama bin Laden, with the increasing certainty that he is still alive prompting senior Democratic senators to brand the effort to dismantle Al Qaeda as a failure. 
 Even as Bush administration officials took the F.B.I. to task for a warning issued on Wednesday about possible attacks on hospitals, the F.B.I. today issued a vague and alarming alert to state and local law enforcement agencies. The alert warned that this week's message, apparently from Mr. bin Laden, plus intelligence reports and recent overseas strikes by Al Qaeda, had raised the threat of attacks. 
 The alert was not made public because there was no specific information about a target, officials said.
"In selecting its next targets," the F.B.I. alert said, "sources suggest Al Qaeda may favor spectacular attacks that meet several criteria: high symbolic value, mass casualties, severe damage to the American economy and maximum psychological trauma. The highest-priority targets remain within the aviation, petroleum and nuclear sectors, as well as significant national landmarks." 
Senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, charged that the Bush administration had been distracted from the fight against terrorism by the preparation for a possible invasion of Iraq. 
"They are so focused on Iraq that they aren't paying adequate attention to the war on terror," he said in an interview.
Mr. Graham added that American intelligence agencies should undertake a crash program to identify and take action against terrorist threats in advance of any military action in Iraq. 
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld underscored today concerns that the United States could face increased dangers of terrorist attacks if President Bush orders military action against Iraq. 
In a radio interview with Infinity Broadcasting, Mr. Rumsfeld said that Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, might try to organize terrorist strikes against American targets if a United States-led coalition moves to disarm him by force. "I have no doubt that if he's able, he would like to see that terrorist attacks occur in the event that military action was taken," Mr. Rumsfeld said.
Mr. Graham said that American intelligence agencies had failed to determine the extent of the terrorist threat even as the country prepared for war. If Mr. bin Laden is alive, he suggested, then the threat to the United States has increased. "If he is still alive and still in charge, that means Al Qaeda continues to have a highly capable and venomous leader." 
The F.B.I. warning was sent today as a confidential alert to 18,000 law enforcement agencies throughout the country, but it was not issued to the public. Government officials said the threat warning would remain at the current level of Code Yellow, the middle range on the five-level terror code index. That was because, the officials said, that the threats were serious enough to warn state and local authorities, but not specific enough to warrant a general alert. Vice President Dick Cheney, who has been sent to an undisclosed location under previous alerts, remained in town tonight. 
In the past some lawmakers have criticized the Bush administration for spreading fear by issuing public alerts without providing information about how to respond as a politically motivated effort to insulate the government from eventual criticism that it failed to act in case of attack.
But several officials said that today's warning was genuine, although they added that there was no intelligence about the time, place or method of any such attack. They acknowledged that the language of this alert was more extreme than similar alerts issued in the past; earlier alerts have seldom made reference to the expectation of large-scale attacks or possible casualties.
At the same time, however, today's warning also urged law enforcement officials to be on guard against smaller attacks with cruder materials like simple explosives.
One official said that that language was a response to the tape attributed to Mr. bin Laden played on Al Jazeera television on Tuesday, which is increasingly being viewed as authentic, and to other events, including attacks on American marines in Kuwait, and the possibility of reprisals for the killing of a Qaeda leader in Yemen by an American missile. 
Tonight, Mir Aimal Kansi, the Pakistani convicted of killing two C.I.A. employees outside the agency's headquarters in 1993, was executed, adding to concerns about reprisals.
Tom Daschle, the Senate majority leader from South Dakota, said the inability to find Mr. bin Laden was a sign of deeper problems in the war on terror. "We can't find bin Laden, we haven't made real progress in finding key elements of Al Qaeda. They continue to be as great a threat today as they were one and a half years ago. So by what measure can we claim to be successful so far?" 
Today's warning was the clearest sign yet of the near certainty in intelligence circles that the audiotaped message broadcast earlier this week, praising terror attacks in Bali and Kuwait, was an authentic recording by Mr. bin Laden. 
A C.I.A. technical analysis of the tape continued today, but without a final determination whether the voice on it was Mr. bin Laden's. 
American officials said that the number of intercepted communications and informant reports had increased in recent days.
The language of the alert was considered by representatives of several executive branch agencies before it was distributed to law enforcement. "This document was coordinated through an interagency process," a White House official said tonight. "It was decided that given the current threat situation it was appropriate that it go out in its present form."
Law enforcement officials dismissed the attacks from Senate Democrats as political grandstanding. "We've busted up cells in Buffalo, Detroit and Portland, we've caught several of bin Laden's chief lieutenants, we have driven the Taliban and Al Qaeda from Afghanistan, and we haven't had another attack here since 9/11," a law enforcement official said. "I would say, all in all, were doing an excellent job." 
However, not everyone exuded such confidence. "The anxiety level is probably as high as it has been since the anthrax attacks," said one F.B.I. supervisor.
The dissatisfaction over the performance of American intelligence agencies, particularly the F.B.I., appeared to have deepened in recent days. Today a group headed by James S. Gilmore III, a former Republican governor of Virginia, concluded that a new domestic intelligence agency should be established.
"We've got to gather this kind of information so we can disrupt the enemy before they attack us," Mr. Gilmore said in an interview after testifying before a House military subcommittee. 
The F.B.I. was under fire today from some Bush administration officials for sending out a confidential alert on Wednesday warning of possible attacks at hospitals in Washington, Chicago, Houston and San Francisco. "There are some raised eyebrows here as to why they would put out something like this," said an administration official. "This was a report that didn't have a lot of credibility, then it goes out and now you really have anxiety levels raised in these cities. It was unnecessary."
The F.B.I. has been criticized from many sides in recent weeks, and more bad news is expected on Friday. The Justice Department's inspector general is expected to issue a report critical of the bureau's disciplinary procedures. The report is expected to highlight a double standard in which senior executives have been given lighter punishments for wrongdoing than rank-and-file agents, according to government officials.

HEADLINE: Teachers Wrap Lessons In Fiction 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA COHEN 

 BODY:
Little did the hapless Richard Burns know that the strange, bedraggled man who pounded on his door one rainy night would end up making him the obsession of a long-dead spirit.
 Or more to the point, subject him to long disquisitions on savings and capital accumulation, the gains of trade and the role of the "invisible hand" in markets. 
 That is because the irksome spirit in this new novel is none other than Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, who is so distraught that his theories have been wretchedly misunderstood that he is driven to return to Earth and set the record straight. 
Though the book, "Saving Adam Smith," may not offer much page-turning competition to Stephen King's collected works, the novel has found its way onto reading lists in economics courses at Rutgers University, LaSalle University, the University of Richmond and a handful of other colleges around the country. 
Looking for fresh ways to engage overloaded students, a growing number of professors at big universities and small colleges are supplementing traditionally sober textbooks with a curious genre: the textbook-novel. 
Written specifically with the college classroom in mind, these works are often by professors who have created characters ranging from a free trade-spouting angel to a short, bald professor (take a bow, Milton Friedman) who likes to solve mysteries. And while pedagogical novels are not new, their growing popularity is. 
"It's an old genre in economics," said Deirdre McCloskey, professor of economics, history and English at the University of Illinois at Chicago. "In the early 19th century, it was quite common to teach free market principles this way." Harriet Martineau, for instance, wrote the nine-volume "Illustrations of Political Economy" in 1832, moral tales intended for adults following classical economics. "It also became a common form later in the late 19th and earlier 20th century in thinking about socialism," Professor McCloskey said. 
What's different now, she continued, is that economists are assigning such books: "That is new. Economists think of themselves as scientists with a capital S, and assume there is a big gap between science and art."
Indeed, these textbook alternatives can be found on syllabuses in hundreds of college economics courses and related subjects around the country. Their use has become the subject of articles in scholarly publications and conferences. Earlier this year, the American Economic Association for the first time held a session on using novels to teach. Publishers, too, are beginning to take notice. "They really do well for us," said Anne Bunn, sales manager for MIT Press, which has published two economics novels since 1998. "We're bringing another one out next year."
Nor is economics the only field to feel the literary impulse. "Evidence suggests that use of the accounting novel in classrooms is fairly widespread and growing in acceptance," the CPA Journal reported in March. And in addition to economics and accounting, fictional texts have also crept into physics and cryptology courses, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.
"I'm trying to teach economics in a different way," said Russell Roberts, an economics professor at Washington University in St. Louis, who is one of the best-known economics novelists. "There are really two goals. One is to put some sugar with the medicine, as students try to master something that is inherently difficult. The second is to bring economics to life in the way a formal presentation can't. It has weaknesses. It's not as rigorous, but there is rigor elsewhere. I'm trying to bring the poetry and the soul to economics, and you can't do that with a graph and a chart."
Professor Roberts has written two novels. The first, "The Choice: A Fable of Free Trade and Protectionism," uses as a model Frank Capra's film "It's a Wonderful Life." In this case, an angel -- none other than the 19th-century English economist David Ricardo -- works to win his wings by offering a protectionist businessman a glimpse of a mean and pinched world without free trade. First released in 1994, the book has sold more than 50,000 copies, most if not all for use in the classroom, Professor Roberts said. The updated 2000 edition is being used by 95 different colleges, according to its publisher, Prentice Hall.
The latest Roberts novel, "The Invisible Heart: An Economic Romance," published last year by MIT Press, examines corporate responsibility and consumer safety while following the blossoming love story between a high school economics teacher and an English instructor. It has been assigned in over 25 universities so far. The publication even prompted Hollywood to come knocking, with DreamWorks asking to see a copy. (Alas, Professor Roberts said, the studio wasn't interested).
In his introductory course, Allen Sanderson, the associate chairman of the economics department at the University of Chicago, uses "The Choice" and an economics mystery novel called "Fatal Equilibrium," part of an extraordinarily popular series by Kenneth G. Elzinga and William Breit, two economists who use the pen name Marshall Jevons. They patterned their protagonist, a Harvard professor and amateur sleuth named Henry Spearman, on Milton Friedman. ("Fatal Equilibrium" is already in its 20th printing and has also attracted some sniffing from Hollywood. The first in the series, "Murder at the Margins," has been used at more than 400 colleges and universities, Professor Breit said.) 
"One of the challenges and goals is to get students to think as economists think about how do you approach a problem," Professor Sanderson said. When he assigns a book like "Fatal Equilibrium," what he hopes is that a student will "sit in the bathtub for a couple of hours and begin to approach problems and think as we do," he continued, adding, "They really are a relatively painless way to learn economics."
Robert Garnett, an economics professor at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, decided to spend the first five weeks of his senior economics seminar last spring teaching "Saving Adam Smith." He had been told about it by a student who came across the book on Amazon.com. 
"What really works well with this particular book," Professor Garnett said, "is that there has been a lot of new scholarship on Adam Smith in the past 10 years, and this book makes that accessible to students in a narrative. It really opens their eyes to what Adam Smith was all about, that he wasn't just a hard-headed free-market economist; that to him, economics was a branch of moral philosophy." 
Jonathan B. Wight, the author of "Saving Adam Smith" and an economics professor at the University of Richmond, said that recent scholarship had revised the conventional view of Adam Smith as a no-holds-barred free-market crusader who believed "greed is good." Just as important as the seminal "Wealth of Nations," Mr. Wight says, is "The Theory of Moral Sentiments," in which Smith argues that a moral community -- with its social norms and government institutions -- must undergird any viable economic one. 
Indeed, the Adam Smith in Mr. Wight's novel may not be all that recognizable. Dispensing advice to the lovelorn and urging inner peace and transformation, Adam Smith's spirit seems to have crossed wires with Dear Abby and Buddha while traversing the spirit world. 
If the students in Professor Garnett's class found the economics compelling, they were less taken with the novel's hard-to-swallow fictional soup. (For instance, there is a love story involving a put-upon economics doctoral student, Richard Burns, who is stalked by an assassin, a disillusioned antiglobalization crusader who rails against the treachery of the World Trade Organization but is secretly backed by the Russian mafia.)
"The best part about it was that it made it very accessible and easy to understand," said Joseph Blosser, an economics and religion major, who was in Professor Garnett's seminar. "The worst part was the literary quality. You can't approach this book as a fine work of literature. You have to approach it as a tool for learning about Adam Smith, and in that sense it definitely accomplishes what the author set out to do." 
Indeed, these novels aren't likely to cross over to the English department anytime soon. 
That is why Professor McCloskey -- who says, "I got into economics because of 'Grapes of Wrath' and Joan Baez" -- prefers serious literature to the narrative textbooks. "I assign Dickens's 'Hard Times,' which is awful as economics but creates interesting discussions," she said.
Professor Roberts candidly admits most of the pedagogical novels aren't very good. "In some of them," he says, "the fiction is great but the economics is mediocre or the economics is great but the fiction is mediocre."
Teaching economics through novels is not to everyone's taste, though. N. Gregory Mankiw, the author of "Principles of Economics," one of the largest-selling introductory economics textbooks, said that he had included the Jevons and Roberts novels in his text's suggested reading list, but that he had never used them in his undergraduate classes at Harvard. "I'm more of an eat-your-spinach kind of professor," he said. "My sense is that they're useful teaching tools in that they're fun, they get students to realize economics isn't quite as dismal as they claim it to be." But to learn about economics, he added, "you're probably better off sitting down for an hour with a textbook than with one of these novels."
Even Professor Elzinga added a note of caution: "I think the main drawback to pedagogical novels is with the instructor, at least in my field of economics, not knowing how to teach from the book, as opposed to simply assigning it as a 'fun' book." 
Although Professor Elzinga collaborated on the mysteries with the express purpose of teaching economics to students, he is happy to note that the books have a number of other readers. "My favorite fan letter came not from a student, but from a woman who was a professor of economics whose marriage was on the rocks," he said in an e-mail message. "She gave one of our mysteries to her husband who, upon reading it, said he now understood his wife's way of thinking. Their marriage was saved. True to her professional colors, she told us buying our book was more economical than marital counseling."

HEADLINE: When Peace Did Not Go Unpunished 

BYLINE:  By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
When Margaret MacMillan began working on her new history of the negotiations leading up to the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, she first had to revise her opinion of her great-grandfather, David Lloyd George, who was Britain's Prime Minister at the end of World War I. To her surprise, she discovered that he was not such a bad chap after all.
 "I grew up hearing what a great man he was and, in the adolescent way one reacts to things, I thought he probably was not that great," she recalled with a smile. "I had come to share Keynes's view that Lloyd George was without moral scruples and ruthless, dangerous and cynical. But in studying the peace conference, I decided he was actually very brave. He was a very good politician." 
 But by the time Ms. MacMillan had completed "Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed the World" (Random House), she had reached a far more radical conclusion: that the Treaty of Versailles, which was imposed on Germany by Lloyd George, President Woodrow Wilson and the French Prime Minister, Georges Clemenceau, was not responsible for the rise of Hitler and the new world war that followed. 
"Hitler did not wage war because of the Treaty of Versailles, although he found its existence a godsend for his propaganda," the Canadian-born historian writes. As for the three peacemakers, she believes they were genuinely well intentioned: "They could not foresee the future and they certainly could not control it. This was up to their successors. When war came in 1939, it was a result of 20 years of decisions taken or not taken, not of arrangements made in 1919."
The traditional view is that onerous war reparations drove the German economy to the collapse that brought Hitler and the Nazis to power in 1933. But Ms. MacMillan demonstrates that the reparations demanded of Germany were less than those paid by France after its defeat in the 1870 Franco-Prussian war. Further, she notes, Germany paid only about one-third of what it owed in compensation for its occupation and destruction of Belgium and northern France.
Rather, she believes, the real problem was that Germany did not feel defeated. "They didn't think they had lost the war," she said during a recent visit to Paris. "They'd never seen foreign troops on German soil. The German army marched back in good order to Berlin. German industry was intact. Germany was still the biggest European country west of the Soviet Union. It never really disarmed, and it was strong enough in 1939 to conquer most of Europe."
So, she was asked, should the Western powers have continued the war and taken it into Germany?
By fall 1918, she said, while the United States had only recently entered the war, France and Britain were exhausted by prolonged trench warfare that had cost them millions of lives. And they had another, more political, reason for signing the armistice on Nov. 11, 1918: "The French and particularly the British felt that, if the war went until spring 1919, the Americans would be that much more powerful, and they didn't want the Americans to be the dominant partner."
Thus, when Wilson, Lloyd George and Clemenceau gathered in Paris to prepare a permanent peace just two months after the armistice, they met on relatively equal terms. 
"They spent an enormous amount of time together," Ms. MacMillan said. She was being interviewed in the Hotel Crillon, which had served as headquarters of the American delegation. "One of the reasons I think the peace conference so fascinating is that it's never going to happen again. You will never get world leaders sitting in the same place for six months."
How the politics and personalities of Wilson, Lloyd George and Clemenceau shaped history, then, stands at the heart of "Paris 1919." Indeed, the British edition of this book, which in June won Britain's prestigious Samuel Johnson Prize for nonfiction, was called "Peacemakers: The Paris Conference of 1919 and Its Attempt to End War." ("I like 'Peacemakers,' but they told me at Random House that anything with Paris in the title tends to sell very well in the United States," Ms. MacMillan said with a laugh.)
"Lloyd George was the most affable and the most resilient, and he was probably the best at negotiating," explained Ms. MacMillan, 58, who is currently Provost of Trinity College at the University of Toronto. "But Clemenceau knew what he wanted and focused on that. And Wilson had a tremendous moral stature. Wilson, of course, could adopt a high moral tone, because he hadn't suffered the devastation."
Although all three leaders had liberal backgrounds, they also brought different global perspectives to the bargaining table: Wilson, who arrived with his famous Fourteen Points on a postwar order for Europe, was an idealist who advocated "self-determination"; Lloyd George was a pragmatist determined to protect and expand the interests of the British Empire; and Clemenceau was leader of a wounded France that twice in his lifetime had been invaded by a militaristic Germany.
"Paris 1919" tracks the complex and heated negotiations that preceded the signing of the peace treaty with Germany in the Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles on June 28, 1919. But it also places the peace conference, which continued for three more years, in the broader context of the extraordinary reorganization of European borders that followed the demise of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires. In the Middle East, too, new nations were created -- Iraq, Syria and Jordan, among them -- while the idea of a Jewish state was born.
The decisions taken in Paris at the time have again assumed relevance today because, in many ways, the post-cold war era has seen the end of the world molded after World War I. Versailles and successor agreements were meant to temper ethnic nationalism by forming viable nations that included large ethnic minorities, but some multiethnic countries created after 1918, like Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, have now broken apart.
"Decisions made in an off-hand, casual way that you think aren't going to matter that much, 50 years down the road matter an awful lot," Ms. MacMillan observed. "What you got after 1989, which I think is what you got in 1919, was nationalism running amok."
It is a view echoed in a foreword to "Paris 1919" by Richard Holbrooke, the former American troubleshooter in the Balkans. "Some of the most intractable problems of the modern world have roots in decisions made right after the end of the Great War," he writes. "Among them one could list the four Balkan wars between 1991 and 1999; the crisis over Iraq (whose present borders resulted from Franco-British rivalries and casual mapmaking); the continuing quest of the Kurds for self-determination; disputes between Greece and Turkey; and the endless struggle between Arabs and Jews over land that each thought had been promised them."
Looking back at his role in the Dayton peace talks that ended the Bosnian war in 1995, Mr. Holbrooke says that "we were, in effect, burying another part of Versailles."
Yet Ms. MacMillan still hesitates before condemning Wilson, Lloyd George and Clemenceau for the consequences of the Treaty of Versailles and the Paris peace conference.
"I kept on thinking, 'What would I have done differently?' " she recalled. "I'm never going to be a great statesman, but if I am going to criticize them, I have to at least think, O.K., what would I have done differently? And you know, I don't know what I would have done differently."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Inch Higher as Mixed News Saps Rally's Vigor

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stocks inched higher yesterday, shaking off earlier declines, as a gauge of consumer confidence showed a rise for November. And despite renewed threats of a terrorist attack, all three main market gauges registered gains for the week, continuing a rally that began in early October.
 But the rally has lost some of its vigor despite good economic news in the last week and a half, including a half-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve; a sharp rise in retail sales, excluding autos, in October; and the jump in consumer confidence. Initial claims for unemployment insurance also declined this week. 
 Even with these developments, the market gauges are still below the levels they climbed to after Fed policy makers announced their rate cut on Nov. 6.
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 36.96 points, or 0.4 percent, to 8,579.09. It was up 0.5 percent for the week, its sixth consecutive gain. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index index climbed 5.56 points, or 0.6 percent, to 909.83, and rose 1.7 percent for the week. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.38 point, to 1,411.14. It finished up 3.8 percent for the week. These two indexes have been up in five of the last six weeks.
One reason the six-week rally may be slowing is the renewed focus on terrorist attacks since the surfacing of a tape earlier this week attributed to Osama bin Laden. Then on Thursday, the F.B.I. issued a terrorist attack alert that said: "In selecting its next targets, sources suggest Al Qaeda may favor spectacular attacks that meet several criteria: high symbolic value, mass casualties, severe damage to the American economy and maximum psychological trauma."
Another reason is that the positive economic data may show only that the worst -- another recession -- has been avoided, not that the economic recovery, which has been slowing this quarter, is ready to pick up speed again.
"The retail sales numbers were very good and the jobless numbers were very good if you were worrying about a double-dip recession," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig. "But if you were anticipating a continuing moderate economic expansion, these numbers were ho-hum."
Mr. Barbera also dismissed the importance of the jump in the consumer confidence index, which rose to 85 in November, from October's 80.6, in the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan's sentiment index. Although it was the first rise in six months, Mr. Barbera said "it just tells you that last month the stock market was up."
"Consumer sentiment is a lagging indicator," he added.
The surprise half-point rate cut suggests that Fed policy makers may think that the economy is in more trouble than many investors seem to think. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, did not appear to make investors feel more confident after he testified before Congress on Wednesday that the economy was working its way through a "soft patch."
The Federal Reserve also reported yesterday that industrial production fell 0.8 percent in October, the third consecutive monthly decline.
Based on flows into equity mutual funds, investors have been at best neutral on the stock market recently. According to numbers from AMG Data for the week ended Wednesday, the four-week moving average of flows into equity mutual funds is flat. In the previous week, there were outflows of $278 million.
But the flows into taxable bond funds were at a four-week moving average of $1.7 billion this week, with much of that going into high-yield junk bonds and investment-grade corporate bonds.
The surprise in the most recent data for the week is the record $81 billion net inflow into money market mutual funds, which are yielding barely 1 percent after the Fed cut its overnight interest rate to 1.25 percent. Robert Adler, the president of AMG Data, said most of this money was from institutional investors but that it was hard to say whether the move was a temporary parking of cash or a significant sign of disenchantment with the stock market.
Technology stocks led the market lower early yesterday, with Intel down as much as 5.8 percent, Microsoft off as much as 2.3 percent, I.B.M. down 2.1 percent and Dell Computer off 6.2 percent.
Merrill Lynch downgraded several semiconductor stocks, including Intel, to a sell ranking yesterday. After the market closed Thursday, Dell reported a 31 percent jump in third-quarter earnings, but the chief executive, Michael Dell, also said that there was no broad recovery on the horizon.
General Electric fell as much as 4.1 percent after a downgrade by J. P. Morgan. As G.E. and the technology stocks cut their losses later in the day, the Dow and the S.& P. moved into positive territory and the Nasdaq wiped out all but a fraction of a point of its losses.
While technology stocks led the market lower early yesterday, they have been crucial to the market turnaround. The two technology-related indexes in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index are up more than 31 percent since the current rally began Oct. 9. They each had fallen 51 percent up to Oct. 9.
Citigroup, which rose 2.1 percent, was among the stocks that led the Dow higher yesterday. Citigroup fell 3.8 percent on Wednesday after new reports in the controversy over what influenced a former star analyst's change in his rating of AT&T stock.
In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note slipped to 4.03 percent, down from 4.05 percent Thursday. Over the last week, the yield is up from 3.85 percent as bond investors pushed interest rates higher when new data indicated that the economy was stronger than many of them had expected.

HEADLINE: Production At Factories Dipped 0.8% In October 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Industrial production fell 0.8 percent in October -- the sharpest decline since September 2001, heightening concerns about the health of manufacturing, a new government report showed today.
 Other data showed an unexpected pickup in inflation at the producer level, and a recovery in consumer confidence. 
 Steve Ricchiuto, chief United States economist at the Dutch bank ABN Amro in New York, said that the reports fit in with the "soft-spot slow-growth jobless-recovery mind-set." 
"All you really know is the economy isn't losing ground," he said.
The decline in industrial production was the third consecutive monthly decline and followed a drop of 0.2 percent in September, the Federal Reserve reported. Economists had expected a drop of just 0.3 percent in October.
Factory output, which accounts for the largest portion of total industrial production, slid 0.7 percent in October, its third consecutive monthly drop, but at least some of the decline stemmed from an auto parts shortage and a shutdown of West Coast ports that curtailed car manufacturing.
Nonetheless, industrial output excluding autos was down 0.4 percent, while output outside the high-tech sector -- computers, semiconductors and communications equipment -- fell by 0.9 percent.
Economists said temporary factors relating to autos also distorted a report showing the largest increase in producer prices since January 2001.
The Producer Price Index, a measure of prices paid to manufacturers, farmers and other producers, rose 1.1 percent last month on big gains in the cost of gasoline, cars and light trucks, the Labor Department said.
The core index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, increased 0.5 percent in October, its biggest move up since a matching rise in September 1999.
While the size of the gains surprised economists, who had expected producer prices to rise just 0.2 percent over all and 0.1 percent excluding food and energy, they said it did not represent a resurgence of inflation.
Instead, economists noted that the out-size gains reflected a 2.2 percent rise in car prices and a 1.9 percent increase in the cost of light trucks, which they attributed to an easing of aggressive sales incentives from automakers as higher-price new models moved into the showrooms.
The department said the core Producer Price Index would have been up only 0.1 percent in October if the sharp increases in car and truck prices were excluded.
A separate survey showed consumer sentiment strengthening from its depressed levels. The University of Michigan's preliminary November consumer sentiment index rose to 85.0 from a nine-year low of 80.6 in October. That put a halt to a five-month slide in sentiment, and exceeded forecasts of a rise to 82.3.

HEADLINE: Leader Sees Lean Times in Westchester 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive, said today that he wanted to eliminate 229 vacant county positions, raise bus fares and cut more than $4 million from a broad range of social service, housing, art and recreation programs to help close a $100 million gap in next year's budget. 
 Mr. Spano also called for a 28.6 percent increase in the county property tax levy, the amount of tax the county collects, a slight drop from the 31.7 percent increase that he initially announced last month. Mr. Spano said he had directed his staff to make additional cuts to bring the tax rate down after residents said they could not afford the larger increase. 
 "This budget is cut to the bone," Mr. Spano said during a news conference at his office, in which he unrolled a 12-foot-long sheet of paper listing all of the cuts and other budget items. "There are people asking us to tighten our belts; we just put a noose around our neck."
Still, Mr. Spano's proposals amounted to a $1.37 billion budget that was 6.3 percent bigger than this year's budget, or an increase of $82 million. Mr. Spano, a Democrat who once pledged to reduce taxes, blamed state lawmakers in Albany, saying that the increased spending would be used entirely to offset rising costs in Medicaid and other state-mandated programs. 
But several Westchester legislators and residents said Mr. Spano was trying to deflect attention from his spending increases over the years. "Instead of blaming Albany, we need to look at what the county fundamentally does," said George Oros, the Republican minority leader of the Board of Legislators, where the 2003 budget now goes for approval.
Westchester's budget tightening comes as cities and towns across the state are scrambling to fill their own budget holes with new sources of revenue. In New York City, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg called Wednesday for a sizable new income tax on people who work but do not live in the city, a proposal that would affect thousands of Westchester residents.
Today, Westchester officials said that while they sympathized with Mr. Bloomberg's fiscal problems, they would strongly oppose the tax on commuters. Susan Tolchin, chief adviser to Mr. Spano, pointed out that roughly 58,000 New York City residents commuted to work in Westchester.
"We would never think of charging them a commuter tax," Ms. Tolchin said. "Because they're working here, they're eating in our restaurants, they're buying goods in our stores, and they're helping our economy. The same goes for Westchester residents working in New York City."
Mr. Spano's major cutbacks included saving $16.4 million by eliminating vacant county positions; $4.2 million by reducing county services, largely through a 15 percent cut across the board for groups that run programs on domestic violence, drug abuse and the arts, among other things; and $2.1 million by deleting some bus routes and stops.
At the same time, Mr. Spano justified setting aside $500,000 for a six-month study on acquiring the Indian Point nuclear plants in Buchanan. He announced this week that he wanted to shut the plants by buying them, or if necessary, taking them through a condemnation process, and replacing them with a new natural gas plant.
If approved, the 28.6 percent property tax increase, one of the largest in county history, would raise $100.4 million more than was raised this year, for a total of $451.5 million in property taxes. Mr. Spano also proposed raising an additional $3.4 million through a 20-cent increase in bus fares to $1.60 beginning March 1, and increasing other county fees.
The county tax is only a share of the total property taxes on a home. Depending on the municipality, county property taxes account for 15 percent to 20 percent of the average tax bill of a homeowner. The remaining taxes pay for school districts, as well as city, town and village operations.

HEADLINE: Still Wary, Taiwan Split Over Change On Mainland 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Government and business leaders here welcomed today the orderly transfer of power in Beijing and a series of Chinese overtures to Taiwan, but a deep split is evident on how to respond.
 Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's minister for relations with China, said conciliatory statements by President Jiang Zemin and Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen during and just before the Communist Party Congress in Beijing showed a new willingness on the mainland to negotiate closer links with Taiwan. At the congress, Hu Jintao replaced Mr. Jiang as head of the party. 
 "The position of both sides, after consideration of what has been said by both sides, is closer than before," Ms. Tsai said in an interview today.
But Ms. Tsai was wary about moving quickly to conclude any new deals with Beijing, even after recent comments by Mr. Qian, who has called for closer transportation links across the Taiwan Strait and has softened some of China's demands before that can happen.
"We still have reservations in the sense that we have to wait for some time to see if what he said is going to be a stable and consistent policy of China," she said.
Taiwan business leaders were much less cautious today, calling for a quick opening of direct flights and shipping routes to the mainland.
"I just hope they can negotiate a deal as quickly as possible," said Y. C. Wang, chairman of the Formosa Plastics Group and Taiwan's richest and best-known industrialist.
Focused on Iraq and the campaign against terrorism, the United States has urged China and Taiwan to avoid confrontations in the coming months like the dispute that erupted in August when President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan briefly hinted at a more pro-independence stance. Beijing regards Taiwan as rightfully a province of China.
Some warming of relations is already apparent. Taipei announced on Tuesday that it would allow chartered flights between Taiwan and Shanghai for Chinese New Year early next year. That would address the annual problem of tens of thousands of Taiwan business executives trying to return home for the holidays on a limited number of flights.
But Taipei said the chartered planes would have to fly via Hong Kong or Macao, taking six or seven hours instead of the 80 minutes a nonstop flight would require, because the Taiwan Strait is less than 100 miles wide. If direct flights were allowed they would approach Taipei so quickly that air defense systems might have trouble distinguishing them from a military attack.
Taiwan businesses have been the biggest "foreign" investors in China in the last decade, and they contend that the lack of direct transportation links and closer governmental relations have hurt their competitiveness. Beijing has welcomed the investment and has increasingly tried to draw Taiwan into a close economic embrace, a policy especially apparent in speeches at the Communist Party Congress.
Taiwan's government has been more wary, especially since the election two years ago of Mr. Chen, of the Democratic Progressive Party, which leans toward greater independence. The party tends to represent less-affluent voters who are wary of competition from low-wage businesses in China.
The opposition Nationalist Party, which ran Taiwan from 1949 to 2000, is closer to the island's business community and favors eventual reunification with the mainland. 
In an interview on Thursday, Lien Chan, the party's chairman, said the Democratic Progressive Party was trying to placate those voters who strongly favor independence from the mainland. "If you do something to please them, you are sure to have 30 percent of them packed up for you," he said. "This is Chen Shui-bian's grand strategy."
Ms. Tsai declined to respond publicly to the criticism.

HEADLINE: Mexican Drug Dealers Turning U.S. Towns Into Major Depots 

BYLINE:  By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: DALTON, Ga. 

 BODY:
This sturdy town in the Appalachian foothills likes to call itself "the carpet capital of the world," and its industry has thrived over the last decade as thousands of Mexican immigrants have flocked to jobs in the mills.
 More recently, though, federal and local law enforcement officials say the same pipeline of immigration and trade has been exploited by Mexican drug traffickers, who have helped turn this corner of northwestern Georgia into a busy distribution center for methamphetamine and other drugs. 
 In Dalton and surrounding areas, drug arrests have steadily risen since the late 1990's, police officials said. Gang-related violence has become common. Outside the police headquarters, a fenced-in lot is perpetually filled with cars, most of them impounded from people suspected of being in the drug trade. 
"We keep arresting people and seizing drugs, but they just keep coming," said Chief James D. Chadwick of the Dalton police. "We're in a boat with a big hole. We can keep bailing, but the hole's still there."
Dalton is by no means alone. From Alaska to South Carolina, law enforcement officials said, Mexican traffickers have taken advantage of spreading Mexican immigration and freer North American trade to establish themselves as the dominant wholesale suppliers of illegal drugs across much of the United States.
The officials said the shift, in which the Mexicans have both displaced other traffickers and opened new markets themselves, has meant a steadily more efficient flow of drugs into the United States, even as border controls have tightened since Sept. 11.
For the traffickers, places like Dalton are often excellent sites to do business, close to growing rural markets and within easy highway access of big cities -- in Dalton's case, Atlanta, Chattanooga and Charlotte, among others. The towns offer the cover of hard-working immigrants and a pool of potential recruits among the out of luck and unemployed.
By establishing new distribution hubs far inside the United States, the traffickers are also posing new problems for undermanned rural police forces and for federal agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration that have long concentrated their resources in border cities.
Traffickers from Mexico have long sold marijuana and heroin in American cities, particularly in the West and Southwest. Since the late 1980's, officials said, they have also contracted with drug producers in Colombia and elsewhere to smuggle most of the cocaine that enters the United States.
But in the last decade, according to government officials and a series of reports on drug surveillance, Mexican traffickers have come to control considerably more of the United States' illegal drug supply. 
They have improved the quality and increased the output of Mexican heroin and marijuana. They have negotiated to receive more cocaine from South American producers as in-kind payment for the loads they smuggle into the United States. They pioneered the large-scale production of methamphetamine, the United States' fastest-growing illegal drug, and they have scrambled to start producing other synthetic drugs like MDMA, or ecstasy.
"They have certainly emerged as the major wholesalers throughout the country," said Michael T. Horn, director of the National Drug Intelligence Center, a Justice Department agency that analyzes drug trafficking in the United States. "Their influence is moving aggressively eastward, and they are very aggressive about getting into parts of the drug trade that transcend their traditional involvement in marijuana and heroin."
Although it is impossible to determine how much of the drug trade Mexicans control, federal prosecutions point to their growing role. From 1994 to 2000, the number of Mexican citizens jailed in the United States on federal drug-trafficking charges nearly doubled, to 8,752 from 4,394.
Like the legitimate businessmen energized by the loosening of North American trade, the traffickers have sought new economies of scale, taken advantage of the freer movement of Mexican trucking into the United States and even shifted some production closer to consumers.
In Hawaii, drug intelligence officials said, Mexican distributors have now overtaken Asian organized-crime groups as the primary suppliers of crystal methamphetamine, or "ice," which is the islands' most serious drug problem.
In the Central Valley of California, Mexican methamphetamine producers have built scores of so-called super labs that turn out 10 or 20 times the amount of drugs that biker gangs and other traffickers historically produced, federal reports show. Elsewhere in the state, Mexican traffickers have begun growing marijuana in national forests.
From bases on the West Coast, officials said, the Mexican traffickers have moved across the Northwest and Midwest, hiding among fruit pickers in Washington, resort workers in Colorado and construction workers in Minnesota.
Like the Los Angeles street gangs that helped spread crack in the late 1980's, Mexican traffickers have followed Interstate highways to the Southeast, feeding a surge in methamphetamine use in states like Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee. They have also built bases in New York, Florida and other former strongholds of Colombian dealers. 
So far, the Mexican traffickers' growing role in wholesale distribution in the United States has been accomplished with relatively little violence, officials said. In part, they said, that is a consequence of the breakup of Colombian cocaine cartels and the Colombians' focus on more profitable markets in Europe.
In many areas, officials said, Mexican traffickers have worked cooperatively with Colombian and Dominican traffickers, offering drugs on credit and helping to launder the profits. In other instances, the Mexicans have carved out sales turf by underselling Dominicans, Nigerians and American-born traffickers.
Mexican traffickers have also become more efficient, drug intelligence officials said. By smuggling large numbers of smaller drug loads across the border and around the United States in the process known as shotgunning, they have lowered the risk and thereby reduced transportation costs. By moving their distribution hubs away from the border, to the areas around cities like Atlanta and Chicago, they have kept drug supplies and prices more stable.
"The southwest border isn't along the Rio Grande anymore," said W. Michael Furgason, the special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration's Atlanta office. "It's in Atlanta and North Carolina and Chicago and even Yonkers and New Rochelle."
In addition, some Mexican drug gangs, like Colombian cartels before them, have organized themselves into networks of smaller, semiautonomous units responsible for specific tasks like building false compartments in cars or obtaining the chemicals to make synthetic drugs, officials say.
Those smaller groups may be even harder for law enforcement agencies to pursue, as is becoming evident in places like Dalton. Despite the city's changing demographics, the Dalton police force has only one fluent Spanish speaker among its 86 officers, and almost no capacity to infiltrate tight-knit Mexican criminal groups.
"The chances of these people getting caught are now somewhere between slim and none," Chief Chadwick said. "If the state patrol stops somebody on the highway and gets a load nowadays, it's pure accident."
Dalton has long had its share of drug problems, and its drug users remained overwhelmingly white and African-American. Police officials said drug abuse remained relatively low among Hispanic residents, who make up 22 to 35 percent of the 45,000 residents of the greater Dalton region. 
But where local methamphetamine cooks might turn out a couple of pounds of the drug at a time, Mexican traffickers offer much larger quantities and lower prices, police officials said, attracting dealers from nearby areas of Tennessee and North Carolina as well as Georgia.
"The sad truth is that our community is becoming known as a key area for the distribution and manufacture of narcotics," members of a Whitfield County grand jury wrote earlier this year in an unusual open letter to local newspapers.
The Mexican traffickers are notably low profile, and police officials say the immigrant workers on whom they prey are similarly discreet.
T. Jefferson Morris, a Spanish-speaking criminal defense lawyer in Salisbury, N.C., said he had seen a clear pattern in the recruitment of drug couriers. "Within two weeks of one of these guys' losing his job," Mr. Morris said, "he will be approached by somebody who will say: 'I know you have a family and you need money. I'll give you $1,500 to deliver something for me.' "
When the couriers are arrested, they often do not know whom they are working for, and while the police might jail them, the traffickers can usually do worse -- like threatening their families back in Mexico.
When federal and state law enforcement agents in Kannapolis, N.C., stopped Mexicans in a car carrying 27 pounds of methamphetamine, with a wholesale value of about $175,000, they were struck by more than the quantity of drugs.
The car, bought in Atlanta, had been driven to Southern California, outfitted with a hidden compartment for drugs, agents said, and an atlas showed the courier had simply headed east on Interstate 40 until reaching a trailer park on the edge of Kannapolis.
Federal law enforcement officials said much of the area's methamphetamine appeared to originate in the western Mexican state of Michoacan and in California, with clans of Mexican traffickers who dispatch their members to supervise distribution of the drugs in the United States.
"They deal with their own people and no one else, and they are extremely difficult to penetrate," a federal official said.
Nor do the Mexican distributors in the United States seem to have been weakened by a series of recent arrests of major traffickers in Mexico.
So far, the growing presence of Mexican drug distributors has yet to create much of a backlash for the immigrant workers they hide among. Even in places like Dalton -- where Mexicans are credited with helping save jobs in plants that might have moved elsewhere because of labor shortages -- the drug problem has begun to unnerve some of those who have tried to help accommodate the newcomers.
Unlike business leaders in some neighboring cities, those in Dalton have strongly supported Mexican immigrants, calling them saviors of a carpet industry weakened by aging American workers.
Nonetheless, the town sits in a region that is still growing accustomed to the presence of Mexican grocers and taquerias, and where the new immigrants still prompt fights at school-board meetings and occasional marches by the Ku Klux Klan.
"There are people everywhere in New York and Los Angeles, and in Dalton, Ga., who are going to say, 'These people are not like us; their morals are different,' " said Erwin Mitchell, a former Democratic congressman who founded an innovative program to absorb Latino children into the local schools. 
"But this is a place where not one American job has been lost to immigrant workers," Mr. Mitchell added. "And because of these immigrant workers, thousands of jobs have been saved for Americans."

HEADLINE: Senate Balks at Big Bills Sent Over by the House 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Last-minute disputes erupted in the Senate today over major bills already passed by the House, halting progress on the creation of a Department of Homeland Security and demonstrating that the election results had not erased sharp differences in Congress. 
 Angry Senate Democrats, joined by a few Republicans, criticized what they described as special-interest provisions tucked into the domestic security measure by the Republican-led House. They planned a vote for early next week to strip the items, further clouding the bill's prospects for quick passage. 
 "It is a terrible shame that some in Congress have sought to add these irrelevant and unconsidered amendments to a piece of legislation as urgent as homeland security," said one of the bill's authors, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. 
A group of Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans were also pressing the House for a more generous bill than the one it passed on Thursday extending unemployment benefits.
The House, whose members left town today, has scheduled no major business for next week, and its Republican leaders adopted a take-it-or-leave-it stance on both measures.
They said that if the Senate changed the domestic security bill as approved by the House, negotiations could last into December before a measure was approved. Further, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois said the House had no intention of considering the Senate unemployment plan.
"We're done, we're closed up," said the spokesman, John Feehery. "Why don't they do ours?"
Three Republican senators -- Gordon H. Smith of Oregon, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Peter G. Fitzgerald of Illinois -- joined Democrats to push for added unemployment benefits. They argued that the House version was too stingy, given the economy's continuing struggles. They said their plan would cover two million people nationwide through March while the House approach would take in only 800,000 through January.
If the House and the Senate cannot agree, then extended benefits -- those beyond the standard 26 weeks -- will expire for thousands on Dec. 28.
"It would be unconscionable," Mr. Specter said, "for the Congress to adjourn without taking care of so many people who are unemployed with the economic downturn that has resulted from Sept. 11."
But House officials noted that their version would keep extended benefits in place until the new Congress convened in January and took another look.
The fight over domestic security, meanwhile, was another impediment to a bill that, having stalled for months, figured prominently in the election campaign, when Republicans accused Democrats of undercutting it. It finally seemed headed for adoption in the lame-duck session after Democrats agreed to let the White House alter Civil Service rules at the new department.
On Wednesday, the House approved the department for a second time. But Mr. Lieberman and the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, moved today to kill seven House provisions that they described as extraneous favors to Republican constituencies, including the pharmaceutical industry.
A provision drawing significant criticism was one that Democratic lawmakers said would protect drug companies from liability for adverse reactions to vaccines, and even interfere with current court cases. A pair of Republicans, Senator John McCain of Arizona and Representative Dan Burton of Indiana, also faulted it.
"It's really disgraceful," Mr. McCain said, "watching the pharmaceutical industry getting the first rewards of their campaign contributions."
But other Republicans said the drug companies needed protections to help them develop vaccines safeguarding against terror attacks.
Some of the other provisions at issue included limits on liability of airport security companies, an easing of the ban on offshore corporations' getting government security contracts, and a research center that Democrats said was earmarked for Texas A&M University.
Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, defended the provisions, saying they were justified and were no more atypical than those of other major legislation. And "by stripping them out," Mr. Gramm said, "you are risking killing the bill."
Democratic leaders said that although members of the House had left town, that chamber could still accept both a revised domestic security bill and a more generous unemployment bill next week, since it has not yet formally adjourned.
"My view," Mr. Daschle said of the House's domestic security measure, "is that the Republicans would be embarrassed by this and ultimately would vote in favor of the bill with these provisions stripped out."
While balking today at the House versions of the domestic security bill and extended unemployment benefits, and at a bankruptcy overhaul that the House had stripped of an abortion rights provision, the Senate did give final Congressional approval to a wide-ranging inquiry into the Sept. 11 attacks.
The investigation is to be carried out by a 10-member independent commission, approved by the Senate without dissent, that will have authority to go beyond an intelligence inquiry conducted by Congress and explore the role played by federal agencies like those responsible for aviation and immigration. Relatives of those killed in the attacks had pressed for the investigation, which the White House resisted until a compromise was reached on the makeup of the panel.
The House approved the investigation early this morning as part of a broader intelligence bill, one of a handful of measures to win passage by House members, who worked into the early morning in an effort to bring the 107th Congress to a close.
They also approved a plan to make government aid available to the insurance industry in the event of future terrorist attacks. That bill is expected to win passage in the Senate next week.

HEADLINE: Broad Manhunt in Jordan Isolates, and Angers, a Town 

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: MAAN, Jordan, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
This tribal town in the desert in south Jordan has been sealed off for nearly a week, as police and army officials chase down a small-time Islamic militant who they say heads a defiant gang of drug and arms smugglers.
 Though the authorities have repeatedly insisted that the operation is only a local matter, it is of a scope that experts say is rarely seen in Jordan. It has resulted in the deaths of two police officers and two suspected gang members. As many as 100 people have been arrested, the police say, as house-to-house searches have uncovered dozens of weapons and a workshop to make more. 
 The people of Maan are angry.
"Nobody should imprison an entire village like this," barked one man at a barber shop, who gave his age as 22 but who would not, like most people here, reveal his name. "They locked up a whole town."
Another man on the street yelled, "This is political!"
It was impossible to learn what he meant because official minders corralled reporters back onto a bus, near the end of a controlled visit to demonstrate that order had been restored. 
Jordanian officials have acknowledged crosscurrents of crime, tribe and religion here that could lead to unrest in the event of an American war with Jordan's neighbor Iraq. And some critics suggest that this is just what is driving the crackdown: the government's desire to prove that any protest against a war will not be tolerated.
Moreover, these critics assert, almost three weeks after the slaying of an American diplomat, Lawrence Foley, in the Jordanian capital, Amman, the government appears to be seeking to reassure the United States that it is serious about crushing any hint of radical Islam. The police say Mr. Foley's death has no connection to the unrest in Maan, but the subject of their manhunt, Muhammad Ahmad al-Chalabi, who is also called Abu Sayyaf, reportedly staged a rally here in support of Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11 terror attacks.
Wherever local people's sympathies lie, experts say, the scope of this operation may only further alienate places like Maan, a poor town of some 40,000, many from independent-minded Bedouin tribes strongly opposed to any attack on Iraq.
"It will backfire on the government," said Labib Kamhawi, a political scientist. "It is not enough to be heavy-handed."
Abdul Latif Arabiyat, a former Parliament speaker and head of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan, complained that the government had refused his offer to mediate the problem peacefully -- which he hinted suggested motives other than merely a desire to quell a local problem. 
"It is a mistake," he said. "You are not going to solve it this way. What after? What is the next step? You put a whole city under curfew -- for how long?"
Today the area's governor, Muhammad Breikat, described the operation as a reaction to an "outlaw" gang, in which he said Mr. Chalabi was a top member. 
He also said that the curfew imposed on Sunday had been lifted two days ago and that the "situation is calm and quiet now in Maan."
But Mr. Chalabi remains at large, and hundreds of special forces police officers in blue camouflage remained in the streets today to keep order.
Mr. Breikat said the gang manufactured guns, smuggled weapons and hashish, burned property and even shot at a dormitory of a university where women are enrolled.
"Because of the huge number of violations committed by this gang," he told reporters here today, "the people of Maan demanded protection."
To back up these assertions, the police displayed several dozen rifles, handguns, ammunition, rocket-propelled grenades and equipment for manufacturing weapons they say have been seized in the last several days. Earlier, police officials reported that they had seized a launcher and rocket-propelled grenades from Mr. Chalabi's house.
In general, the Jordanian authorities consider Maan a flashpoint town, with local tribesmen carrying weapons and operating, to some extent, outside regular law and order: since 1989, there have been three uprisings here, in protest of prices of commodities like bread and cigarettes, and against threatened military action against Iraq. Some experts say the discontent, in recent years, has become more political and religious than purely economic.
The current confrontation began on Oct. 27, when Mr. Chalabi, who is about 35, was stopped by the police as he left Maan, reportedly taking his crippled wife to the hospital in Amman, 130 miles north. Mr. Breikat said Mr. Chalabi, who he said was driving without a license plate, shot at the police and fled.
In a later shootout with the police, he was wounded, reportedly in the shoulder, then freed from a hospital by several gunmen. Officials say they waited two weeks for local tribal leaders to hand over Mr. Chalabi, and moved in with troops only when that effort failed. 
There have been few details of the fighting, though officials have said over the last several days that there were several fierce firefights. One resident, who gave his name as Muhammad Ali, said he he had seen three of his cousins shot dead by the police, and others said several houses had been seriously damaged.
One house in the Tora neighborhood, the site of the most intense fighting, was seriously damaged: windows were blasted apart, walls raked with gunfire and several rooms burned out.
At the same time, there were several hints of sniper positions on the roof, including a scattering of spent rifle shells. 
Mr. Chalabi reportedly escaped from the Tora neighborhood during a firefight early in the week.
His whereabouts are said to be unknown, though the police have said they arrested several of his top associates.
There is much debate about whether Mr. Chalabi is an Islamic preacher, a criminal or both. He was among about 60 suspected militants imprisoned in 1994 in connection with several minor bombings. Mr. Breikat said Mr. Chalabi and his associates merely "use religion as a cover."
But several people here today called Mr. Chalabi a staunch Muslim and nothing more. "He's 24 hours God, God, God," said the man at the barbershop. "He doesn't know drugs. He doesn't know terrorism."

HEADLINE: A Prospect Delayed In Canada's Arctic 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: INUVIK, Northwest Territories 

 BODY:
The streets of this town above the Arctic Circle and alongside the Mackenzie River are lined with heavy construction equipment and dormitory trailers for drilling workers, all poised for a long-expected natural gas bonanza.
 Seventy-three trillion cubic feet of proven and potential natural gas reserves -- three and a half times what the United States uses annually -- lie within the Mackenzie River delta area, mostly on native lands, promising to convert this remote region of Canada into a major energy provider for the vast American market. 
 Most of the native groups that once opposed drilling and a planned $3 billion pipeline project have abandoned their protests and now favor exploiting their energy resources. The territorial government is pressing Ottawa for an ambitious road and bridge program that would lower production costs. 
But as winter dawns, allowing for the movement of drilling teams down the region's frozen river system, energy companies are planning only one-sixth as much exploration and drilling this year as they completed in 2001.
With natural gas prices way down from their peak late in 2000, largely because of a slowing United States economy that has curbed American demand for the fuel, the bonanza that once looked so promising here has yet to materialize.
"Everybody's ready at the starting line and we're just holding our pose," said Ken Mitchell, vice president for transportation at the Inuvialuit Development Corporation, a local venture capital firm that has invested in seismic research and drilling and is a unit of the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, a business and public interest group owned and operated by Inuvialuit Indians.
Still, Canadian energy experts and businesspeople here in the Northwest Territories say that the lull, part of a general slowdown in drilling across North America, is just a temporary delay of an expansion of natural gas development that will transform not only the Northwest Territories but much of the rest of northern and coastal Canada as well.
"We still think that the northern gas pipeline will go ahead eventually," said Martin King, energy commodities analyst at FirstEnergy Capital, an investment bank and brokerage house based in Calgary, Alberta. "Before too long, we think prices will be generally stronger, supplies tighter, and that will certainly help the economics of building the pipeline."
Canada is already the world's third-largest natural gas producer, after Russia and the United States, with about 50 percent of its 6.5 trillion cubic feet of annual production destined for the American market. Fifteen percent of the gas used in the United States, the world's biggest consumer, now comes from Canada. With known American fields maturing, that percentage is expected to rise substantially in the next decade.
There are signs that natural gas drilling in Canada will increase in coming years despite the current slowdown. Exploration has been picking up in recent years off the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia, where the federal and provincial governments are trying to replace the flagging fish industries with energy prospecting, and there have been major hydrocarbon discoveries in the last few months. Also, Canada is considering lifting a moratorium on oil and gas development off British Columbia.
To many environmental groups, more exploration and longer pipelines threaten the pristine Canadian North and shorelines. "Canada's wilderness faces an onslaught of oil and gas development that is right now destroying and degrading habitat of endangered species," said a report released last month by the Sierra Club of Canada and the Natural Resources Defense Council.
The drilling efforts are intended not only to bolster exports, but to encourage the replacement of coal-fired power in Canada with gas-fired electricity to meet the country's commitments under the Kyoto protocol, which the government has signed and now seeks to have ratified by Parliament.
One of the most promising gas exploration and pipeline development projects is along the 1,200-mile Mackenzie River, a region with abundant grizzly bears and caribou and so far almost entirely lacking in roads or other infrastructure. Inuvik, a government and business town of some 3,000 set up in 1955 as a supply center for mining and hydrocarbon exploration, is the only place for miles and miles with video stores, a fashionable restaurant or two and more than the most basic amenities.
A consortium led by Imperial Oil Resources of Toronto -- including ExxonMobil Canada, Shell Canada Resources and Conoco Canada -- is moving far along in completing the regulatory process necessary for building the pipeline. They are supposed to be joined by the Aboriginal Pipeline Corporation, a company formed by 30 native leaders that is lobbying in Ottawa for loan guarantees so it can invest $630 million in the project.
The severe weather conditions and high labor costs make it expensive to explore in this region. But most Canadian and American energy analysts believe that the Mackenzie Valley route, which could connect the energy-rich Prudhoe Bay of Alaska via an offshore pipeline through the Beaufort Sea, is more cost-effective than an Alaska pipeline proposal now being considered to transport Arctic gas. They also say it is unlikely that both projects will be developed at the same time.
The competing Alaska pipeline, which would transport gas from Prudhoe Bay down along the Alaska Highway and through the adjacent Yukon Territory, received a big boost when the United States Senate passed an energy bill in April that offered $20 billion in subsidies and $10 billion in loan guarantees to companies willing to build the project. But the bill stalled in conference committee, and the fate of the Alaska pipeline depends on whether President Bush can revive the bill next year in the face of opposition from Senate Democrats to a separate provision opening the Alaska National Wildlife Preserve to oil drilling.
 That setback for Alaska led Imperial Oil to announce on Wednesday that it is considering expanding the capacity of the Mackenzie Valley pipeline to 1.9 billion cubic feet a day from a current planned capacity of 800 million to 1.2 billion cubic feet in response to increasing interest expressed by potential shippers. 
The snags have been encouraging for leaders of the Northwest Territories, who badly want a pipeline built here for the jobs, money and other benefits it will bring.
"It is only a matter of time before there is a pipeline that runs down the Mackenzie Valley with feeder lines to wells up and down the valley, giving local people access to heat and electricity," the territory's premier, Stephen Kakfwi, predicted. "Many communities will become twice the size, and all will have paved roads."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: SEOUL; 
Korea Leader Backs Plan To Block Oil To the North

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
President Kim Dae Jung has endorsed a decision to cut off shipments of heavy oil to North Korea beginning next month if that country fails to take steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons program, a senior official said today. 
 The official said that Mr. Kim was fully consulted on delicate negotiations among South Korean, Japanese and American officials and recognized the need for a strong position, despite his previous pleas for dialogue rather than tough action that might upset efforts toward reconciliation between North and South Korea. 
 The official suggested, however, that Mr. Kim had been disappointed to learn that the North had gone ahead with a program for developing nuclear warheads with highly enriched uranium in violation of a 1994 agreement. 
"How can President Kim abandon his 'sunshine' policy in the last stage of his presidency?" said the official, referring to Mr. Kim's efforts at engagement with the North since his election as president in December 1997. "He is making his last pitch." 
On Thursday, the United States, South Korea, Japan and the European Union all agreed to allow the delivery of a last shipment of oil to North Korea in the next few days, but to suspend all future shipments until that country gives up its effort to develop a weapon from highly enriched uranium.
President Bush said today that the United States had "no intention" of invading North Korea. But he also said that Washington would not consider improved economic cooperation with the North until it dismantled its nuclear weapons program.
Administration officials said that the president's statement, released late today, was intended to reassure the North that the cutoff of oil shipments was not an act of hostility, and did not presage the kind of confrontation now under way with Iraq.
"North Korea's clear violation of its international commitments will not be ignored," Mr. Bush said in the statement. "The United States hopes for a different future with North Korea. As I made clear during my visit to South Korea in February, the United States has no intention of invading North Korea. This remains the case today."
Mr. Kim's endorsement, however reluctant, appeared to have been critical in the support of the American demand to cut off the shipments. 
The decision was made at a meeting of board members of the consortium set up by the 1994 agreement to build twin light-water nuclear reactors to fulfill the North's energy needs. The oil is provided under that agreement.
The decision called into question the future of the project under which the consortium, the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, has cooperated on building the light-water nuclear reactors on the northeast coast of North Korea. 
The official, in a briefing for foreign journalists, went to extraordinary lengths to disavow any sense that South Korea and the United States had been in fundamental conflict over how to respond to the revelation by the North. 
"I hope North Korea will understand where we want to go on this issue," the official said. "The ball is in the court of North Korea." 
While there was an agreement to suspend the oil shipment in December unless North Korea acts, a ship that is now en route to the North with a shipment of heavy oil was allowed to continue. 
Choi Jin Wook, senior fellow at the Korea Institute of National Unification, an adjunct of South Korea's unification ministry, predicted that North Korea would "try to attract attention from the world community" by attacking the decision but "does not have any cards."
The North Korean economy, he said, has deteriorated steadily while the country faces a cruel winter in which, according to the World Food Organization, thousands of people are likely to die from disease and starvation.

HEADLINE: THE MAYOR'S BUDGET PLAN: LAW ENFORCEMENT; 
Trim of 1,900 Has the Police Crunching Some Numbers

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposed cut of 1,900 police officers will place a significant challenge before Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly as he works to reduce crime and prevent possible terrorist attacks, say current and former police officials.
 Yesterday, at a news briefing on the arrest of man in the killing of a Russian immigrant, Mr. Kelly would not discuss specifics of the impact of the cuts, noting that the budget plan had not yet been finalized. He said that while the department would have fewer people, the exact size of the cuts remained unclear. 
 "So we have not yet put in place a plan to respond to the reductions," he said. Mr. Kelly said that staffing levels in precincts were as low as they had been since the early 1990's, and that the entire class of roughly 2,500 recruits in the Police Academy would be assigned to precinct patrol when they graduate early next year. "We have to make sure that we at least maintain and indeed increase the level of staffing that we have in our patrol commands," he said.
Toward that end, the Police Department will examine units that have grown in recent years, a senior police official said, focusing on the narcotics division, which had more than 2,000 officers as of June; the intelligence division, which had 690 officers; and the warrant section, the largest component of the fugitive enforcement division, which had more than 740 officers. "The other units will obviously experience some attrition," the official said. "We'll have to make some hard decisions."
Since taking office in January, Mr. Kelly has overseen a 6 percent drop in overall crime and a 12 percent drop in murder, even as he has assigned nearly 1,000 officers to counterterrorism duties. However, the police force, which peaked at 40,710 in 2001, was reduced by 1,600 officers earlier this year, and Mayor Bloomberg's proposed reduction of 1,900 more officers, announced on Thursday, would reduce it to 37,210 by July 1. At that level, Mr. Kelly would have roughly the same number of officers as the city had in 1996, and by July 1, 2004, attrition could bring the number as low as 34,800, according to projections by the city's Independent Budget Office.
"He's got to do more with a shrinking Police Department," said John F. Timoney, the first deputy police commissioner in New York and the former police commissioner in Philadelphia. "The impact of terrorism on the resources can't be underestimated, in terms of people working on it, training and deployment."
While Mayor Bloomberg spared the police -- along with the Fire and Education Departments -- from the full brunt of the 7.5 percent to 9.5 percent cuts he had originally sought, the reduction, coupled with attrition, could leave the department at its lowest levels since 1993, when there were 34,641 police officers on the city payroll, according to the Independent Budget Office.
But because crime has dropped since 1993, when there were about 600,000 felonies, today's department, which has handled just 131,350 felonies so far this year, has a much lighter load. Preston Niblack, the deputy director of the budget office, said that even with the mayor's proposed cuts, the city would have about 45 police officers per 10,000 residents, well above average for cities with more than a million residents.
"The situation today in 2002 and 2003 looks a lot different than it did 10 years ago," he said. "We had much higher crime rates then. The city was just coming out of a recession, which was much worse than this recent economic downturn has been. So is there a risk that bringing down the police force will result in an increase in crime? Yes. Is this 1993 again? No."
Mr. Kelly, who also served as police commissioner in the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins, was one of the architects of the Safe Streets, Safe City program, which paid for much of the growth of the department beginning in 1994, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani took office and chose William J. Bratton to replace Mr. Kelly. Some experts and police officials cite the broad expansion of the department, coupled with new crime-fighting strategies, as the driving force behind the declines in crime. The Giuliani administration, up until Mr. Giuliani left office, also spent several hundred million dollars on overtime programs that effectively put 1,000 more officers on the street every day.
So Mr. Kelly will have his work cut out for him. "These would be very heavy cuts, even in normal times," said Thomas Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission. "These are abnormal times because of the threat of terrorism against the city. So therefore, I worry about cuts of that level." 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 19, 2002

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about plans to reduce the New York Police Department by 1,900 officers misstated the position of John F. Timoney, who discussed the costs arising from terrorism. He is a former first deputy police commissioner, not the current one.

HEADLINE: Word by Word: Hu's Goals 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of the statement today by Hu Jintao, the new general secretary of the Communist Party of China, as the members of the new Standing Committee of the Politburo were introduced to reporters, as translated by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service for the United States government: 
 On behalf of the newly elected members of the central leading organ, I would like to thank all comrades in the party for their trust. We must live up to the trust of all comrades in the party and the expectations of the people throughout the country, hold high the great banner of the Deng Xiaoping Theory, comprehensively implement the important thinking of the Three Represents, and earnestly fulfill the various tasks set forth by the 16th C.P.C. National Congress. 
 We will closely unite and rely on all party members and the Chinese people of all nationalities throughout the country in carrying forward our cause, forging ahead into the future, keeping pace with the times, and working hard to build a well-off society in an all-round way, speed up socialist modernization, and blaze a new trail in building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
I have heard that friends from the media wish to know how the newly elected collective central leadership will proceed with their work. Here I am willing to tell you very clearly.
The 16th C.P.C. National Congress has established the important thinking of the Three Represents, along with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory, as our party's guiding ideology that our party will adhere to for a long time to come. 
This is a historic decision and also a historic contribution that has clearly set the direction for our advance.
The report delivered by Comrade Jiang Zemin to the 16th C.P.C. National Congress has systematically summed up the basic experience over the last 13 years, comprehensively expounded the fundamental requirements on carrying out the important thinking of the Three Represents, and explicitly outlined the goal of endeavor for our party and country in the first 20 years of the new century. 
It has also set forth principles and policies in the economic, political and cultural fields, as well as on national defense, the motherland's reunification, diplomacy and our party building.
All these give expression to the will of the entire party and represent the aspiration of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups. They are the political declaration and program of action for our party in a new phase of a new century, and our new collective central leadership will implement them unswervingly and consistently. 
We firmly believe that guided and inspired by the spirit of the 16th C.P.C. National Congress, the Communist Party of China will further project a fine image before the world as a party that advances with the times in a pioneering spirit.
The entire party and Chinese people of all ethnic groups will be more closely united to concentrate on construction and development in order to consistently push forward the cause of China's reform, opening up, and modernization. 
We are convinced that China is bound to have a better future, and with its development and progress, China is bound to make even greater contributions to world peace and development. 
I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to the friends from the press and media for your hard work in covering the 16th C.P.C. National Congress.
We look forward to better cooperation with you in the future. Thank you all.

HEADLINE: Chinese Leader Gives Up a Job But Not Power 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Jiang Zemin may have relinquished the top position in the ruling Communist party today, but his reappointment as head of the Central Military Commission immediately raised questions about the real extent of the power held by his successor, Hu Jintao.
 As a weeklong meeting of the Chinese Communist party leadership wound to a conclusion, the talk here was more about Mr. Jiang's apparent victory in nominal retirement than about Mr. Hu's ascension. 
 The Standing Committee of the Politburo, the top council that was expanded today to nine members from seven, was clearly packed with Jiang loyalists who could prevent any major departures in policy -- although it is unclear what if any changes Mr. Hu might have in mind. With his reappointment as head of the military today, Mr. Jiang -- who spent 13 years as party leader -- also seemed intent on keeping one critical position for himself.
Mr. Hu could be a "figurehead" on the Standing Committee, said Cheng Li, an expert in Chinese politics at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y. 
Joseph Fewsmith of Boston University, an expert on the Chinese leadership, said, only half jokingly, "It seems that Jiang is stronger today than he was yesterday."
"Hu Jintao has to wait another five years and then try again for dominance," Mr. Fewsmith added. 
By various counts, five and perhaps six of the nine Standing Committee members are close to Mr. Jiang. Those known to be Jiang loyalists include Wu Bangguo, who has been an economic official; Zeng Qinghong, Mr. Jiang's longtime aide and strategist; Jia Qingling, former party secretary of Beijing; Huang Ju, former secretary of Shanghai; and Li Changchun, former secretary of Guangzhou.
Tonight's news programs featured Mr. Jiang at an event in the Great Hall, greeting the retired and promoted military brass and warning them of the stiff challenges they face in a changing world.
Even as all generals over 70 were swept off the Central Military Commission, Mr. Jiang was reappointed chairman, evoking memories of the late Deng Xiaoping, who virtually ran the country for a time from that perch. Mr. Jiang is not nearly so venerated, but the post guarantees him a strong voice on security and foreign policy matters, and he appears to enjoy personal support from the military.
Some experts think Mr. Jiang might still resign from the military post next March, during the annual meeting of the National People's Congress, when he must give up the state presidency at the end of his two legal terms. Others think he is planning to stay on longer, at the possible risk of fostering divisions at the top during a military crisis. 
News programs also showed a moment of political theater at an unusually emotional reception in the Great Hall of the People this afternoon. Thousands of delegates to the disbanded Communist Party congress assembled in a huge circle to exchange greetings with the retiring and the newly chosen leaders.
Somewhat woodenly, Mr. Hu praised the achievements of Mr. Jiang and his "third generation leadership" and pledged to carry on his work and thoughts.
What seemed clear today was that, in the near term, at least, Mr. Hu might have little choice. Still, the changes made this week will create a new political chemistry. Mr. Jiang appears to have protected his interests this week, but an older generation of leaders in major party councils is now gone and the rise of younger, more educated officials will change the atmosphere and lead to unexpected alliances, a party official said, speaking anonymously. 
Considerable speculation has centered on the ambitions of Mr. Zeng, 63, regarded as the mastermind of Mr. Jiang's success. Among other tasks, he has been placed in charge of the party secretariat, a position formerly held by Mr. Hu that gives him influence over important personnel decisions and other matters. 
The competition between Mr. Hu and Mr. Zeng may be the one to watch, say some experts who predict that the tough and wily Mr. Zeng could lead Mr. Jiang's well-placed "Shanghai faction" -- loyalists to Mr. Jiang brought by him to Beijing from Shanghai -- and eventually challenge Mr. Hu for the top spot. His relations with Mr. Hu are a mystery. 
Despite the obstacles he faces, no one should underestimate Mr. Hu, said Mr. Li, the Hamilton professor. Though he may be surrounded by Jiang proteges, he has been more successful at bringing his own allies, younger technocrats from his years in the Communist Youth League and in three remote provinces, into the Central Committee. Now he can foster his own networks of influence. 
"Hu has the most important position in China, and he can build on that if he is smart," Mr. Li said. 
At the videotaped reception this afternoon, Mr. Hu toasted Mr. Jiang with words that some interpreted as indicative. 
"Now, for the sake of continuing to advance the party's cause, many comrades have taken the initiative of retiring from their central leadership positions," he said of Mr. Jiang and others of the "third generation." In doing so, they are "demonstrating a broad-mindedness and the sterling integrity of a Communist."

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Tax: Some Cry 'Ouch!' 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "The Mayor's Real-World Budget" (editorial, Nov. 15): 
 Thanks to the 1970's financial crisis, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg does not have the luxuries of tax cuts and deficit spending that his businessman-turned-politician counterpart in Washington has.
Mr. Bloomberg has shown the courage to propose spending cuts, property tax increases and unpopular revenue generators like the commuter tax and tolls on East River bridges -- all without playing the political blame game.
He is proof that financial leadership and popularity do not go hand in hand, and yet he is praised for courage in tight economic times. The Washington counterpart should take note.

Re "The Mayor's Real-World Budget" (editorial, Nov. 15):
 How can big business continue to be given financial incentives to stay in New York City while the very employees who constitute these businesses are penalized for living outside the city and coming in to work? 
 My wife, daughter and I lived in New York City. We didn't want to leave. We moved because we couldn't afford to live there. In case Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg hasn't heard, our taxes in Westchester are also going up. We get hit from both ends. 
Perhaps city residents would like to help us pay for our Westchester police and firefighters. Perhaps they could chip in for our garbage collection. It doesn't get picked up free of charge in Westchester, either. Commuters already contribute millions to the city's economy just by eating, shopping and playing there. I'd like to say I won't vote for Mr. Bloomberg in the next election -- but I don't even have that right!

HEADLINE: THE MAYOR'S BUDGET PLAN: LABOR; 
City's Straits Help Mayor In Dealing With Unions

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Eclipsed by the bold tax proposals that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg outlined in his budget address this week was a request for $600 million in concessions from the city's labor unions.
 Mr. Bloomberg is seeking a broad array of such concessions, like longer workdays for civilian city employees, fewer vacations and possibly longer workweeks. Officials would also like to see city workers contribute to their health care expenses, which they currently do not do, and give more to their pensions. 
 Mr. Bloomberg took pains on Thursday to say that layoffs were a last resort, but he quickly added that he would turn to them if needed. "With cooperation from labor -- and you will see that that is part of our plan -- I believe that we can continue, through early retirements and buyouts, to downsize the labor force without layoffs," Mr. Bloomberg said. "If we can't, nobody is going to stand up and say we aren't going to do it."
Asking city workers for concessions or warning of layoffs never endears a mayor to organized labor. But since Mr. Bloomberg released his plan to plug the city's $1 billion hole for this fiscal year, responses from union leaders have been muted. 
Mr. Bloomberg, who enjoyed almost no labor support when he ran for mayor, may actually find himself in a better position than his predecessors in negotiating with unions, said labor officials, budget experts, and former and current mayoral aides. 
Days after he was elected last year, Mr. Bloomberg visited the headquarters of several important city unions, and invited union leaders to City Hall. Those leaders knew that Mr. Bloomberg owed them nothing.
Next, the mayor settled important contracts for teachers, police officers and firefighters that had been locked up in protracted negotiations. Further, a series of scandals have left District Council 37, historically one of the city's more powerful unions, with a leadership change and less power. 
This week, many union officials said that the blow of Mr. Bloomberg's requests was mitigated in part by a plan to raise property taxes and impose a personal income tax on commuters, as well as by the mayor's praise for city workers.
"You are detecting correctly that the climate is different," said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers and chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee, "because the mayor, instead of going right after labor or services, has really tried to share the pain by calling for tax revenues." She added, "Even though we are very leery of contributions by people who shoulder a lot during a budget crisis, we recognize that there is a budget problem and there is a willingness to sit down and explore solutions."
Indeed, the budget, with all its red ink and implied headaches, may be this mayor's best weapon after many years of rancorous relationships between City Hall and organized labor.
"Mike Bloomberg is better positioned than anyone has ever been since the 1970's to negotiate concessions with unions," one former city official said, "because there is no one out there questioning this fiscal crisis. No one at all. The worst thing the unions can do is strike, and there will be no public support for them if they do. But the worst thing he can do is layoffs, which is a nuclear weapon."
To be sure, the city's labor force is not eager to lead a parade for the mayor. During final contract discussions this year, firefighters and police officers held rallies against the city, and those workers would tell anyone who listened how much they detested the inhabitants of City Hall. 
Patrick J. Lynch, who heads the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, declined to come to the mayor's early meeting with labor officials, and their relationship has been frosty. "If I had to bet the odds on the mayor's favorite labor leader," said William T. Cunningham, the mayor's communications director, "the odds would be long on Pat Lynch." 
Mr. Lynch derided the mayor's budget plan on Thursday. "We're at a crossroads with crime and we believe the mayor is making a wrong turn," he said. "Once crime gets out of control, it takes years to get it back under control, and a safe city equals an economically strong city."
Some budget experts think that the mayor should be tougher, that now is the time to more sharply reduce the city's work force, which has crept up in the last few decades. "Everybody knows Giuliani grew the work force, primarily in police and education," said Edmund J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research and policy center. 
And whether the mayor can even achieve what he is seeking from the unions is an open question. In the budget the city adopted last spring, he called for $500 million in concessions, and so far has gotten only half of that. "The case he made for $600 million was well done," said Diana Fortuna, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission. "But they have a bit of a credibility issue since half of the $500 million was a loan from pension funds and the other half was never achieved."
Mr. Cunningham acknowledged that the administration had yet to obtain concessions, and warned that City Hall's conciliatory tone could change. "We haven't gotten what we asked for," he said. "I don't know that I would call labor leaders recalcitrant, but time is not their ally here."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: SECURITY; 
Terror Alert Brings New Steps To Prevent Attacks, U.S. Says

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER with JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
White House officials said today that they were taking extra precautions to protect the nation's most critical facilities from terrorist assaults after an F.B.I. warning that Al Qaeda may be planning "spectacular attacks" with mass casualties in the United States.
 "A lot is being done to bring additional protective measures, particularly to critical infrastructure," said Condoleezza Rice, President Bush's national security adviser, in a briefing to reporters. White House officials said that by "critical infrastructure," Ms. Rice meant nuclear plants, chemical plants, oil refineries, airports, railroads and bridges, among other things. 
 At the same time, American intelligence officials said today that a senior Qaeda operative had been captured and taken into American custody in recent days. Officials declined to identify him or where he was captured, but they did say he was one of the top dozen Qaeda operatives, and so was considered a significant catch. 
He was not, they said, one of the most widely recognized Qaeda leaders -- Osama bin Laden or his senior deputies, Ayman al-Zawahiri or Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.
Senate Democrats have criticized the administration, charging this week that the president's focus on preparations for war with Iraq are distracting him from what they call the failure of his campaign against terrorism. Democrats were reacting to the release this week of an audiotape apparently made by Osama bin Laden.
Today Ms. Rice responded sharply to that criticism. "Let me start by saying that the president begins his day at 8 a.m. in the morning with the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, joined shortly after that by my colleague Tom Ridge, and the F.B.I. director, and his counterterrorism person to review the terrorism threats against the United States," Ms. Rice said. "He does not begin his day on Iraq."
Ms. Rice added that while the president considered Iraq part of the war against terrorism, "the part of the war on terrorism that is going after Al Qaeda" and "trying to protect the country is fought aggressively every day, every hour, by this administration."
Ms. Rice also said the F.B.I. alert that went out to state and local law enforcement agencies on Thursday night was "a summary of intelligence, not a new warning." The alert said in part that Al Qaeda "may favor spectacular attacks that meet several criteria: high symbolic value, mass casualties, severe damage to the American economy and maximum psychological trauma."
Gordon Johndroe, spokesman for the White House Office of Homeland Security, said that in recent weeks, since other F.B.I. terrorist warnings on Oct. 9 and 23, the administration had been in touch with state and local governments as well as private companies to make suggestions on adding security at power plants and transportation centers. 
Despite the recommendations, however, homeland security chiefs from several states said they had done little more this week than pass the warning on to local law enforcement agencies. They said that the latest alert, though frightening, lacked specificity, leaving state officials with little direction as to how to respond.
"It's too vague," said Lt. Col. Craig Beardsley, who is responsible for homeland security in Kansas. "It gets to that point where you can only do so much. I think, frankly, most states are doing what they can."
Lt. Gov. Dave Heineman of Nebraska said budget realities prevented a direct response to such broad warnings. "We can't afford not to take it seriously," he said, "but on the other hand, that doesn't mean we run out and put 50 additional law enforcement personnel on the street either."
Mr. Heineman said his priority was to disseminate the information widely to the people who patrol the state's two nuclear power plants and its other infrastructure, to every local police and fire department, and to private venues where crowds gather.
In Iowa, Ellen Gordon, the homeland security adviser, said the "spectacular" warning was just one of several received in the past few weeks. "It's worded a little bit differently," she said, "but if you read the content, it's similar to the other messages." 
"We're doing the same things we've been doing," she added. 
Mitchell Singer, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, the Washington-based group that represents the owners of the nation's 103 nuclear reactors, said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had not advised the group of an increased threat level.
"If you're asking me, 'Has there been any talk about this around here?' No, there has not been," Mr. Singer said. "If it was considered to be a viable threat, what they call a credible threat, then from the state of readiness the plants are on now, it would go even into the next level."
Patti Grisanti, spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Public Safety, spent most of today doing interviews for local television and radio programs to remind the public to be on heightened alert. 
"Basically we're reminding people, every time we hear from the F.B.I. and that radar screen comes up again, not to get complacent," she said. "We need to carry out our daily lives as normal, but the public are the eyes and ears, and if they see anything unusual they should call local law enforcement agencies." 
Ms. Grisanti said that there had been no changes to security at the state level in response to the warning. "Because we have no credible threat to Colorado and the alert level was not moved from yellow to orange, there have been no specific changes," she said.

 THE TERRORIST NEXT DOOR
The Militia Movement
and the Radical Right.
By Daniel Levitas.
Illustrated. 520 pp. New York:

St. Martin's Press. $27.95.
 SINCE 9/11 it's been easy to forget that only a few years ago the greatest threat to domestic security seemed to be homegrown extremists. The adherents of Christian Identity, Posse Comitatus, Aryan Nations and so on now look like small fry, but Daniel Levitas comes to remind us that the people who gave us Oklahoma City are still out there. 
"The Terrorist Next Door" may not be the definitive history it purports to be, but the information it provides is voluminous and, in many cases, new. Levitas has spent much of his career tracking the radical right, first in the Midwest during the farm crisis of the 1980's and more recently in Atlanta. The journalists who beat a path to his door in the 90's found him an invaluable source, and what he has to say here is meticulously footnoted to an impressive range of archives, court papers, F.B.I. and state files, obscure radical publications and personal interviews.
His central character is William Potter Gale, a World War II veteran who did more than anyone else to shape the militia movement. Gale, who died in 1988, was a virulent anti-Semite who was descended from Russian Jews, an advocate of armed revolt who made sure never to be caught with a gun in his hand. He had a genius for combining millenarian racial theology with strategies of violent and pseudo-legal resistance to government authority. The groups he inspired signed up thousands of members, and his ideas infected tens of thousands.
Many of the figures who flit through the pages of the book had contact with Gale and his manifestoes, but he himself was not much of a leader. His influence came mostly through others who plagiarized his writings or took over his organizational efforts. Altogether, "The Terrorist Next Door" will do little to disabuse the reader of an image of the extreme right as an assemblage of con men, blowhards, crazies and dimwits. In tracing its checkered fortunes, Levitas doesn't hesitate to settle some old scores -+with law enforcement officials who did not take the threat from the right seriously enough, with the neoconservative leaders of the Anti-Defamation League in the 1980's who in his view soft-pedaled the movement's anti-Semitism to cuddle up to evangelical Protestants who supported Israel.
"The Terrorist Next Door" can be slow going. The cast of characters and acronymic organizations is at times hard to keep straight, the author rarely passes up the opportunity to pursue a digression, and the far-flung and often disorganized nature of the movement makes it hard to wrestle into a single narrative. A 34-page "Reader's Timeline" helps some. 
Levitas's greatest contribution may be to show how important the now largely forgotten farm crisis was in building support for Gale's ideas. Some farmers facing ruin seized upon the false hope of saving their farms through legal mumbo jumbo. Foreclosure sales offered occasions for violently confronting the state. More than a generation ago, Daniel Bell's seminal edited volume, "The Radical Right" (dedicated, interestingly, to Levitas's grandfather Samuel Levitas, the longtime editor of The New Leader), made the claim that status politics rather than class conflict explained the radical right's resurgence in postwar America. "The Terrorist Next Door" offers evidence that class -- or at least economics -- is still relevant in the postindustrial age.
How serious a force is the militia movement today? Its numbers are not great, and its ideology is of limited appeal. Vigilant law enforcement and public exposure by groups dedicated to combating it have worked powerfully to reduce its numbers. But if we have learned anything over the past few years it is that numbers are not necessary to create havoc. "The Terrorist Next Door" offers both essential data for the history of American extremism in our time and a cautionary tale for the future.

HEADLINE: Fierce Entanglements 

BYLINE:  By Deborah Sontag; Deborah Sontag is a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
When Michael Wilkes left Sumter, S.C., two decades ago, he was trying to escape what he perceived to be his bloodstained fate. He was only 21, but he was already in trouble -- in petty trouble with the law, in big trouble at home. He didn't want to end up like his father: a career criminal, a wife beater and dead by his wife's hand. So, baby-faced and jittery, Michael boarded a Greyhound for New York, fleeing an urge to exact vengeance on the stepmother who killed his father. He was running, too, from a failed, violence-ridden marriage of his own.
 At first, things went well. Michael quickly found a job as a gofer for an art studio in Manhattan. He worked hard, the owner took him under his wing and within two years he had settled into a cozy basement apartment in Queens. That's where he met Sylvia. 
 Sylvia, the landlady's daughter, was voluptuous and dark-skinned, with fine features and twinkly eyes. She thought that Michael was "adorable and nice," and she was impressed by his cooking, especially his barbecue sauce. It was only a matter of time before they got involved. Michael's plans to recreate himself suddenly became more complicated. 
Michael had succeeded in starting over as an industrious working man. But he thought that his hostility toward women was something he could not choose simply to rise above. He just felt it in him; if he got passionate about a woman, he was prepared to be betrayed, and his guard went up. And with Sylvia, the passion was intense. "I loved her to death," Michael says. It's a phrase
that a man given to battering women probably shouldn't use.
Right from the start, Michael found himself falling into familiar patterns with Sylvia. "The distrust of a woman -- I had it deep," he says. "I physically abused my first wife -- smacks, punches, kicks. And then I turned around and did it again with Sylvia. The least little thing, I would fight her. I would hurt her. And she didn't deserve none of it." Speaking now as a sober-minded 41-year-old, after all he has been through and more precisely all he has put others through, Michael is trying hard to shoulder full responsibility for his actions. 
Sylvia, however, argues that the dynamic was mutual all along. Michael wasn't the only one who had issues, she says. When they met, she had just escaped from a violent relationship that deteriorated to the point where the man was stalking her, armed with a knife. She was defensive and her fuse was short. "It's inaccurate to say only that Michael would beat me," Sylvia says, more forgiving of Michael than he is of himself. "He did. But we would beat each other. We would destroy the house. It became kind of dangerous for both of us. I didn't know who was going to kill who."
It was a complex situation, murkier than the black-and-white portrayal of domestic violence that currently guides public policy. In that view, there's a batterer and a victim; the batterer is an ogre molded -- misshapen -- by patriarchal society; the victim, a mouse made helpless by it. There is only one happy ending: the batterer is punished, the victim liberated. 
But Sylvia did not see Michael as a monster. She saw him as the product of a lousy childhood. She also saw him as a good provider and, in time, as the father of their two daughters. Nor did she see herself as defenseless but rather as the beneficiary of a good upbringing, as a self-reliant working woman and as someone who stood her ground. She never wanted Michael locked up; she wanted him to change. She wanted to rehabilitate her family, not to break it up. And in that way, Sylvia -- like so many other women who refuse to call themselves victims -- is a formidable challenge to doctrinaire thinking about the nature of domestic violence and how to combat it. 
Since the end of the 19th century, American courts have been denying husbands the right to "chastise" their wives, but abusive men were rarely arrested, much less prosecuted. The police didn't want to get involved in what was going on behind closed doors or usurp a man's authority in his home. In most cases, they didn't even have the legal authority to make domestic violence arrests unless they had personally witnessed an assault. When they were called into a domestic situation, officers would extricate the man for a walk around the block and then return to the job of fighting what they perceived as "real crime." 
As the feminist movement grew in the 1970's, advocates for women began to decry what they described as the government's collusion with batterers. They struggled to build a network of shelters for battered women and to get domestic violence redefined as a serious crime. They lobbied for new state laws that would remove the police's discretion and mandate arrests for domestic violence. And they succeeded. Over the last two decades, and especially in the last 10 years, mandatory arrests have become a linchpin of the government's effort to address the issue; they are seen as a way to protect women, punish offenders, deter future violence and send a message that spousal abuse won't be tolerated.
Now, though, a growing number of professionals are questioning the effectiveness of the mandatory arrest policies that advocates fought so long and hard for. Making more arrests and ensnaring more couples in the criminal justice system has not yet proved itself as a policy of deterrence, they say. And arrests sometimes backfire, especially in inner-city neighborhoods, causing unintended problems for some of the women that society is trying to protect. It would seem, they argue, that we are ignoring human nature, putting principle above the lives involved and creating an unproductive antagonism between the system and some victims. Many battered women, for instance, don't want their men arrested or put away. The questioners, who include academics, crime experts, black feminists and social workers, are wondering aloud if we have come to rely too much on the law to solve a problem that defies easy solutions.
After all, the criminal justice system is a blunt club for a problem as psychologically dark, emotionally tangled and intimate as domestic violence. At the very least, it cannot address the abuse that is not criminal. Serious violence, physical and sexual, is only part of the problem, and many experts are equally concerned about the psychological and emotional abuse that warps so many lives. 
Then, too, there is the vastness of the phenomenon. In New York, the police field at least 200,000 complaints of domestic abuse a year. Even under the new laws, only tens of thousands result in arrests, the vast majority for misdemeanor-level abuse. But that is still a significant number of offenders for the system to process, and in the end only a fraction of offenders get prison time. Thus, many men are cycled through the system to little avail, sometimes ending up angrier and back with their partners.
It is indisputable that many women are protected, educated and freed from misery by the courts and the counselors. But many others resist or resent the intrusion of the government into their intimate lives. Often, they are still deeply involved with their abusers and feel belittled by professionals who presume to know what's in their best interest. They don't want to be humiliated for choosing their partners, pressured into leaving them or blamed. They don't want to be "battered by the system," as a recent workshop given by survivors of domestic violence in New York was called. 
"Crimes of an intimate nature make it much more difficult for people to come forward, and the volume of cases dictates that it can be an impersonal and horrific experience," says Abena Darkeh, domestic violence coordinator for New York City's criminal courts. "I suspect that the majority of people working in the system would not choose to go through it" if they experienced domestic violence themselves.
Well-meaning professionals often find themselves in an uncomfortable and sometimes adversarial relationship with victims. Prosecutors, especially, become frustrated by the many women who balk at testifying against their husbands. Increasingly, social workers are pushing for an approach that is more clear-eyed and less judgmental. 
As Ruth Schulder, a social worker in the Bronx, says: "Nobody has the right to say to a woman, 'You can't be with this guy.' So we have had to deal with the reality." And the reality is that abused women often make calculated decisions to stay with their partners. Sometimes a woman really has no choice; she's scared that leaving would make him more dangerous, or she doesn't think she can survive financially on her own. But other times she stays for the same reasons that people in other kinds of imperfect relationships do: because of the kids, because of her religion, because she doesn't want to be alone or simply because she loves him.
As they weigh the successes and inadequacies of the criminal-justice-dominated approach to domestic violence, a handful of experts are calling for a repeal of mandatory arrest laws altogether. Others, in larger numbers, are suggesting fine-tuning the criminal justice approach, making it both more humane and less central. They want more prevention and intervention on the community level. Still others, the therapeutically minded, are so bold as to suggest not only working more collaboratively with families but also doing so in a way that includes the men.
"If we don't work with the men, we can't change the world," Geraldine Abelson, a social worker, said at a recent conference in New York. Her comment underscores the idealism of many in the field. They don't just want to make women safer. They want to break the cycle of violence. They want to change the world. And that may well be too utopian a basis for any public policy.
Linda Mills took the podium at a New York City-sponsored domestic violence conference this fall to give a keynote speech that she knew would rankle many. Her voice rang out with an accusation and a dare: "Mainstream feminism has maintained a stranglehold on our explanations of, and responses to, domestic violence, and it is time to take our voices back." Then Mills offered her credentials for making such a charge. Publicly, she is a legal scholar and social worker who is a vice provost at New York University. But, she told the crowd, she, too, is a feminist, and she, too, is a onetime victim of domestic violence -- at the hands of a man she described as a violence-prevention expert.
"He was passionate about his work, passionate about me," Mills said. "I loved the attention he gave me; I started to love him. When he socked me in the arm the first time, I was surprised. I was hurt and I was angry. He shared with me his history: an abusive mother, an absent father. He was sure that's where his anger, his aggression, came from. I listened; I felt sad for him. I told him that if he ever hit me again, I would leave him. When he pushed me and later spat at me, I made the same threats." 
Still, Mills said, her gaze defiant, even though the violence later escalated to include rape, she wouldn't have wanted the police to know. She would never have testified against him. "Doing so would have robbed me of the little dignity I had left." And, she said, the "system" needs to respect women who feel that way. The system, she said, patronizes victims by failing to listen to them, usurping their decision-making power and underestimating them -- underestimating their ability to negotiate their own safety and underestimating their role in the abusive relationship. Domestic violence is construed as one-sided aggression, when often there is a warped dynamic of intimacy in which both the men and the women are players. It is dishonest, she went on, to stifle conversation about the ways in which women, too, are aggressive and violent.
Many in the audience shuddered. But Mills, who first created a stir when she published a 1999 Harvard Law Review article called "Killing Her Softly: Intimate Abuse and the Violence of State Intervention," was asking publicly questions that some in the field have been asking privately. 
Some veteran advocates see Mills as an ivory-tower pontificator whose views are dangerous, capable of inspiring a backlash. They don't want to waste their energy engaging in an internal debate, not at a time when some government officials are asking them to justify the devotion of scarce resources to domestic violence. "Where's the bang for the buck in terms of public safety?" a senior New York police official asked advocates earlier this year.
These advocates find themselves in an uneasy position: first, relying on a male-dominated institution -- the criminal justice system -- then, defending it despite their own ambivalence about the arrest policies they encouraged. 
Sylvia never thought the police belonged in her home. She didn't call them when Michael gave her black eyes. She didn't call them when he broke her nose in a fit of delusional jealousy, although she sat him down and pointed to her bloody, disfigured face and said, "What if someone did this to your daughter?" But she did call 911 one time and one time alone -- about a decade ago, before New York passed its mandatory arrest law -- when Michael threatened to leave and take their daughters. Two female officers showed up. Sylvia taunted him in front of them, playing on his chronic fear that she was cheating on him, a holdover from his bad first marriage. She told the officers that Michael couldn't take the children because the girls weren't his (a bald lie).
The officers then tried to rile him. "I wish a man would hurt me," one said, hand on the butt of her gun. "I would blow his brains out." But in the end, all they did was tell him to get lost. Michael camped out in his mother-in-law's basement, scared that this time Sylvia wouldn't take him back. After a few days, he returned with trepidation and apologies to the scene of the crime, his home. "After a man abuses a woman," he says, "his famous thing is, 'I'm sorry."'
Sylvia stood firm. She said: "I'm goddamn sick of your sorries. You're just one sorry expletive ." She shut him up and talked at him about his suspiciousness, his possessiveness, his temper and his violence. And a light went on for him, Michael says. A light went on, and it stayed on, because, he says, "she spoke the truth. For the first time, I was listening to a woman, and she made much more sense than I did."
As she was talking, though, Sylvia was questioning herself. "Lord, history is repeating itself," she was thinking. "I'm going back down this way with another guy." But she believed that Michael was different, that he had a good heart. "Being that he went through so much, he had a real problem," she said. "But we were determined to be with each other." 
Sylvia undertook to counsel Michael herself. "Sylvia's tongue-lashings," as Michael calls them, went on for years, always with the same bottom line. His actions had consequences. If he hit her again, she would leave. End of story. Unfortunately, though, it wasn't the end of the story. 
The case of Tracey Thurman in Torrington, Conn., called national attention to just how dangerous -- and costly to government -- the old approach could be. In 1982, Thurman repeatedly and to no avail called the police to report brutal threats by her estranged husband. Then, in 1983, Thurman's husband, a short-order cook at a restaurant frequented by police officers, stabbed her repeatedly. When the police arrived, they didn't arrest him immediately; they stood by as he kicked his bleeding wife in the head twice. Thurman survived and won an approximately $2 million jury award against the local police department. Her story became a classic cautionary tale about police inaction in domestic violence cases.
An experiment in 1984 in Minneapolis played a defining role in reshaping the police approach. On the basis of 314 domestic violence cases, a study conducted by the criminologists Lawrence W. Sherman and Richard A. Berk concluded that arrests discouraged batterers from committing future acts of battery. The authors cautioned that the sample size was small and the findings preliminary, but their caution was not heeded. Citing their work, a federal task force recommended that arrest become the standard response to misdemeanor domestic violence cases. It did; most states now have mandatory arrest laws.
After his Minneapolis study, however, Sherman refined his thinking on the basis of further studies that revealed a far more complicated picture. He oversaw one such study in Milwaukee, which showed that arrest makes low-income men more violent than does a simple warning by the police. The low-income men in Milwaukee, most of whom happened to be black, were three times as likely to be arrested than employed white men were. Therefore, by his study's oddly precise calculations, mandatory arrest in Milwaukee prevented 2,504 acts of violence against primarily white women at the price of 5,409 additional acts of violence against primarily black women.
Although the results were expressed in racial terms, Sherman said the men's status in society was the determining factor. Arrests generally deterred employed offenders, the studies showed, but provoked unemployed offenders to commit up to twice as many more assaults. That is, if a goal of the arrest policy is to protect women, the policy seems to backfire when applied to the low-income population that is most likely to be arrested for domestic violence.
Sherman, now a University of Pennsylvania professor, began to argue that laws mandating arrests for misdemeanor domestic violence offenses should be repealed. "Until you admit that mandatory arrest is a failure in our inner cities, you won't get anybody to spend a penny on looking for other alternatives," he told me. Defenders of pro-arrest tactics say that mandatory arrest laws work much better when they lead to prosecution and treatment. But Sherman and others counter that prosecution and treatment are problematic, too.'It's because of O.J. that a lot of men are now catching the blunt end of it," Michael says. Indeed, some defenders of current policies like to cite the Simpson case to explain why mandatory arrest and no-drop prosecution policies are important, no matter what the studies show. During Simpson's trial, prosecutors played a 911 tape of a frightened Nicole Brown Simpson pleading with the police to rescue her from her husband. O.J. was never arrested because Nicole didn't want to press charges. If Los Angeles had had a mandatory intervention policy, Nicole Simpson's wishes wouldn't have mattered. The police could have built a case despite her. If prosecutors needed her testimony, they could have subpoenaed her, and if she refused to comply, a judge could have held her in contempt.
Cheryl Hanna, a Vermont Law School professor and former prosecutor, wrote in a 1996 Harvard Law Review article that it used to make her squeamish to use the state's powers to coerce a reluctant victim like Nicole Brown Simpson to cooperate. She preferred to dismiss or indefinitely postpone such cases rather than subject the women to revictimization by the state. She now says that she was wrong. She should have served the greater good by reaffirming the government's hard line against domestic violence.
Some cases are so unambiguous and gruesome that the government's instincts to override a victim's wishes seem entirely justified. In 1994 in New York City, Mario Russo stabbed his wife four times in the chest, missing her heart by just an inch. She was seriously injured, and Mario, then a new immigrant from Italy, told the police to arrest him. In the station house, he confessed to the stabbing in a torrent of broken English, saying his wife was mentally ill, that she "got out of line" and that he "went crazy." Yet, stunning prosecutors, Rosa Russo insisted on testifying in her husband's defense. She said she had been cooking, they got into an argument and she fell on her knife. On Valentine's Day in 1995, her husband was convicted of attempted murder and sent to prison. Nonetheless, at least for a while, the Russos kept up their relationship. He wrote to her, and she visited him. She even requested a conjugal visit, prosecutors said. 
But then there are the cases in which the government seems overeager to take an unequivocal stance against spousal abuse. The case against Joseph P. Kirkner IV, in Chester County, Pa., for instance, was a simple assault case. Kellie Kirkner called 911 on July 4, 1999, to report that her husband had choked and shoved her. Kellie, however, decided that she didn't want to testify against her husband because she wanted to preserve her marriage. Prosecutors subpoenaed her; a judge quashed the subpoena. The prosecutors did not relent, appealing to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and keeping the case open even as the Kirkners split up. In the end, the Supreme Court ruled that the judge's decision was inappropriate, and in October, three years after the incident, the case went to trial. 
Kellie Kirkner requested immunity from prosecution -- she, too, had hit and struck her spouse, she eventually testified. As the jury understood it, what transpired was more of a battle royal over credit-card spending than spousal abuse. Joseph Kirkner was acquitted.
One unforeseen consequence of the mandatory arrest laws has been that many women are getting arrested along with their boyfriends or husbands. Police arrive at a home, face accusations and counteraccusations and arrest both parties. Advocates for women see this as an unfortunate way in which the new laws, as interpreted by poorly trained police officers, have hurt women. In New York, legislators were persuaded to amend the law, requiring police officers to determine the "primary physical aggressor" and arrest only that person. Mills argues, however, that the proliferation of dual arrests might signal that there is more reciprocal abuse than people want to acknowledge.
Defenders of pro-arrest policies say that the legal system can and should learn to handle domestic violence cases both aggressively and with sensitivity. They often point to the way that domestic violence is addressed in a place like Brooklyn, which has a felony court dedicated to the issue. The court has an unusually low rate for dismissing cases while also assigning every victim an advocate who directs her to services. In preparing its cases, the D.A.'s office does far more social work than is traditionally done by prosecutors, says Wanda Lucibello, chief of the special victims division there. 
"There's so much gray area in these cases," Lucibello says, with "land mines in every direction. It's a philosophical discussion, day in and day out."
As a result of some of those philosophical discussions, Galla Hendy, 33, is one former victim who says that the system was responsive enough to allow her to liberate herself from a dangerous relationship -- eventually.
When I met Galla last summer, her ambivalence was right out there, practically sitting on the red plastic table of a Popeyes in Far Rockaway. Fingering a gold hoop in her right ear, she talked wistfully about her ex-batterer and, as of six months earlier, her ex-boyfriend, too. "I miss him," she said. "Yeah, I do. I ain't going to lie. He's not so much of a bad person except for the violence."
When Galla first met him in 1996, she was working two jobs to support her three children. She was a home health aide by day, a stripper by night. One evening, he came into the strip club, and she asked him if he wanted "a wall dance or a lap dance." They ended up talking. She let him know she was dating someone, and he said: "Forget about Mr. Wrong. Here is Mr. Right." And for quite some time Galla agreed with him. They seemed to have so much in common -- both health care workers, both immigrants (she from Guyana, he from Jamaica), both parents.
They fell in love; four years ago they had a daughter. By Galla's account -- all of this is by her account; her ex-boyfriend could not be reached -- he was frustrated because he wasn't working. He has sickle cell anemia, and he had gone on disability after hip surgery. Galla tried to reassure him, to keep him from beating up on himself. She didn't mean for him to start beating up on her. It began on their daughter's first birthday. Galla's boyfriend was out of the apartment, and she left the baby in the care of her 11-year-old son to shop for a party. When she bustled in with her packages, he was back, and she could see the fire in his eyes. He was outraged by what he saw as her negligence; he struck her with his cane. She calmed him down "by making myself available to him," but things were never completely calm again. 
After many unsettled months and one spectacular argument, she took their daughter and went to stay with a friend. When she returned home, he was angry, certain that she had been cheating on him. He hit her. She begged him to stop. He even put on a pair of boxing gloves and started using her as a punching bag. She felt as if she had nothing left in her to fight back with -- until he took out the rope. He encircled her neck, crazed to know if she was somebody else's woman. The more she denied it, the more he tightened the rope. "I actually thought I was a goner," she said. She lied, saying that she had been cheating on him. He let her go, and he left the room. But he returned with a gun, placing it under a pillow in front of her face. Eventually, the fight drained out of him. "You see what you made me do?" he said.
At dawn, she said, he brought out a bottle of champagne, then forced her to have anal sex. The kids woke up and absorbed the tension in the apartment. Her son, then 12, got into an argument with her boyfriend, who ended up throwing his gun at the boy and daring him to shoot. Galla sent her son outside and told him to call the police. They came quickly and just as quickly had him on the ground in handcuffs as they searched for the weapon. Galla felt a twinge of betrayal.
He was taken to jail. Galla went to the district attorney's office. She was unsure if she should help prosecutors make a case against the father of her daughter. But counselors there advised her to think about the possibility that the violence could escalate and about the safety of her children. She listened.
When she went before the grand jury, though, she found it excruciating to recount her story of physical and sexual abuse to a roomful of strangers, mostly men. She saw horror in some eyes, boredom in others. She felt as if she were the one being judged.
He was indicted for assault, sodomy and child endangerment. Galla went to visit him in jail. She was hurt and confused to see the man she loved behind bars. "Why would I do this to him?" she asked herself. "Then again, why would he do this to me?" He still didn't think he had done anything wrong, but Galla began feeling sorry for him. It wasn't good for his health to be locked up. She herself didn't want to go through a trial. Enough was enough. She wanted him freed and she wanted him home. 
So Galla went to the D.A.'s office and asked if some kind of deal could be worked out. Her boyfriend needed help, she told them; he didn't need to be locked up. 
Lucibello's staff members arranged a plea deal; they eventually counted his six months in jail as time served, and he accepted five years of intensive probation and assignment to a batterers' intervention group. And when he was released from jail, the couple reunited. 
But he came out of jail with a lot of animosity in him. He wanted to engage Galla in relentless conversations about the incidents that led to his arrest. He wanted her to agree that it was all her fault. He was angry about having to attend a program. He kept his fists to himself, but he did grab her hard by the shoulders a few times. Their little daughter would hide the phone. "Don't call the police on Daddy," she'd beg her mother. Earlier this year, after Galla refused to let him use her new pearl white car for his newspaper delivery job, he moved out.
Still, a month later, Galla found herself calling him when she was lonely. When she started dating someone else, he threatened to shoot the man, telling Galla she would see her name in the papers. She called 911. There is now a full order of protection that prohibits him from making any contact with her. Galla doesn't miss him anymore, she told me in late October.
On a typical lackluster fall day, a parade of sad and angry men and women filed before Judge John M. Leventhal in New York Supreme Court facing felony charges of assaulting, kidnapping or murdering their wives, husbands and same-sex partners. It was hard not to be struck by just how many of them there were, dealing in such a public way with intimate lives gone awry, and to multiply it out across the country and queasily feel the vastness of the phenomenon.
It was also hard not to notice that while the judge and almost all the lawyers were white, almost every defendant was black or Latino, either unemployed or taking time off from jobs cleaning houses or stocking grocery shelves for their court appearances. Lisa C. Smith, a Brooklyn Law School professor and former prosecutor, told me that she doesn't think domestic violence really is a crime that cuts equally across all social classes. "In order to get people to care about the concept, it was painted that way, but it's not true," she said. "It's far more prevalent in the lower socioeconomic level."
Indeed, federal statistics show that low-income women are far more likely to be victims of domestic violence. But Judge Leventhal said he thought that the class composition of his courtroom reflected instead an under-reporting of domestic violence by more affluent people. Other experts echo this; the more affluent have the means to handle their domestic violence problems privately -- using private physicians, therapists, hotels, divorce lawyers. 
I asked the judge if it bothered him that the government was arresting more poor people for crimes that he believed to be committed by all classes. "Sure it bothers me," he said, looking discomforted. A week later, he called me back to say he really didn't look at it that way: "Don't lower-income people deserve protection, too?" 
Dr. John Aponte, a former police psychologist who counsels batterers, says that he hates that the vast number of men referred to him by the courts are on welfare, unemployed or have prior criminal records. "That says to me that the system is rounding up the usual suspects. The system is only getting those available for capture. And let me tell you, the men know it. When the men in my groups see only other poor people in the program, it makes them think, I'm just here because I got caught, so I have to learn how to not get caught."
The issue of race sometimes seems inescapable. One Tuesday this fall, I sat in on a batterers intervention group, a room full of black and Latino men mandated into a 26-week program. After one man denied that he had ever hit his wife, a man named James, playing the self-appointed role of lie-detector, burst out with: "Well, that's not what the white man say! Why do you think you're here, bro?" 
Melinda Hunter, 30, a teacher in the Bronx, told me that her partner used to "play the race card" to stop her from calling the police and that it worked. She was a college-educated woman from Ohio who met her boyfriend when she arrived in New York in 1995. She was a tour guide at Radio City Music Hall, and he was building sets. Unaware of her own attractiveness, she was so flattered by his attention that she overlooked her qualms when she learned that he was in a work-release program. Having just finished "The Autobiography of Malcolm X," she told herself that most black men were going to pass through prison at some point. 
Later, when her partner had grown abusive, he, by then the father of her children, restrained her from reporting him by saying: "They'll send me back to prison. Don't let the white man take me and break up another black family." Even when they finally did land in court, she covered up for him (encouraged by a police officer, she said, who told them, "These things happen"). The charges were dismissed, but her partner's probation officer made him move out. Hunter got herself into a support group, and when I met her last summer, she was adamantly liberated. Little by little, however, because he was familiar, because she is sentimental, because of the kids, she let her partner back into her life. She was embarrassed to tell me this, but, she said, they are going to church together, he is "reborn," and she is trying to have faith in the possible.
In the 1980's, Aponte moved from the police department to New York City's victim services agency to help domestic violence advocates figure out how to deal with the men. At the time, he said, the thinking was (and remains): punishment. "There was a lot of anger in the feminist community. It was: 'They're lost. They're no good. They're beyond redeeming. To deal with the men is to consort with the enemy."'
Aponte felt differently. Many men were first offenders, and he thought they were capable of learning and changing. Beyond that, it was undeniable that a majority of women returned to relationships involving abuse -- "so it seemed kind of imperative to get the men into some kind of rehab." 
Eventually, the system came to need comprehensive programs for men. Since only a small percentage of men arrested for domestic abuse get prison time, judges had to do something with the rest. Batterers intervention programs became a way of disposing of many cases, and they proliferated. Still, many judges view these programs skeptically, as do advocates for women, and New York State does not regulate them, so as to avoid giving them any stamp of approval.
"The jury is still out on whether they do any good," Judge Leventhal said, although he orders many into the programs as a condition of bail. "And there's a fear that they do some harm, that they give victims false hope that these men have been treated, so they welcome them back." 
The very existence of the programs brings up the question of whether and how a batterer can be rehabilitated. Samuel Aymer, a psychotherapist in New York, says the belief that abusers can change is the guiding principle of his work. But he says that many of those running programs have doubts that limit or even poison the process. Indeed, many programs don't even try to be rehabilitative; they consist of didactic lectures based on feminist theory: domestic violence results not from individual personal or moral deficits but from an abuser's belief that he has the right to inflict his will on his partner. In these programs, needless to say, there is little sharing of personal histories; the circumstances and concerns of the men are not discussed.
"These men are not simply puppets of the patriarchal system who must unlearn their pigheaded thinking," Aymer said. "The patriarchal system doesn't make all men abusers. So what is it about these guys? Let's help them develop insights into their behavior. That does not mean excuse the abuse. Reject it. But don't reject him."
Aymer, who used to counsel battered women, was recruited into working with men by Aponte, who trains social workers to combine education and group treatment in 26-week programs that use a lot of role playing. One such program is run on Tuesday nights by Ruth Schulder and Carlos Scott at a Salvation Army office under an elevated subway line in the Bronx. 
I attended the eighth and ninth weeks of the program this fall, before the men's resistance to being there had completely broken down. They sat in metal chairs in a semicircle, arms folded across their chests protectively, defiantly. Wearing hooded sweatshirts or jean jackets, they rocked backward on the institutional blue carpet, jiggling their legs. Many of the men asserted not only that they had never hit their wives but also that it was a matter of principle for them not to do so. I asked Schulder if I had come to the wrong class. "No," she said. "They're lying."
One, a chubby, talkative man said that everything was fine in his home except that his Maria was in a depression. Schulder, who has flaming red hair and a tough, jokey, compassionate manner, snorted and said out of the side of her mouth, "Oh, you can tell the new people."
Then she addressed the man, Alex, directly: "What was your act to get here?" He began, "Well, she--." Schulder cut him off. "Not she -- you. You -- what was the word you used? You shmushed her face, right?" Well, Alex said, after 12 years in a relationship, nobody's perfect. Twelve years and one thing, and suddenly you have the police at your door. That's when James, the self-appointed lie-detector, told him to get real.
Schulder played a horrific tape recording of a 6-year-old girl who calls 911 to report that her mommy and daddy are having a fight. The girl is crying so hard that she is choking. Against the audible commotion in her home, she is screaming "Stop it!" and "Mommy!" and "No, don't take the baby!" The situation and her agitation escalate as her father apparently strikes her sister and tries to choke her mother. The call abruptly ends when, it seems, her mother discovers her on the phone and hangs it up.
"How does that make you feel?" Schulder asked the group. James jumped in first. "Like I want to kick somebody's butt." Several men said that they would never fight with their wives in front of their children, and Schulder pointed out that the parents of the girl on the tape didn't realize that she was there or on the phone. "Kids always see; kids always hear," she said. Schulder told the men that when she played the tape for women in her parenting classes, they all cried. "I was crying inside," one man said. Schulder asked why he held it in. "I am among men," he said.
At another point, Schulder asked the men if their partners respected them. "Every day I'm closer to asking my wife, "Do you fear me?" James said. A bulky man who wears a purple scarf over his plaited hair, James said that he doesn't think he has given her any reason to, but Schulder, letting that pass, asked if his present wife knows he was violent toward his ex. James explained how he dealt with his first wife: "To me it was like, you don't beat her, you can't get nothing from her. All her other babies' fathers, they punch her in the face and she act better. She did what she was supposed to do." Schulder asked what she was supposed to do, what was in her "contract." James said that she was supposed to look after the kids while he went to work. But when he came home from work, he used to find the kids alone in the apartment. So he would "smack her face." Schulder said that she fully understood why it upset him to find his children unattended. "But you don't have the right to hit her," she said. "What happens when you don't do your job at work, do you get smacked?"
At the end of one 26-week class, one of Aponte's men asked if he could hug him. Aponte was taken aback. He doesn't really do hugging. He asked the man why. The man told him that he had never before met a powerful man who wasn't abusive. Aponte hugged him. 
After Sylvia laid down the law, Michael was intensely motivated to change. "I never really laid a hand on her again," he said. "I would want to, but I knew if I would do it, I'd lose this woman I really loved." But while he forced himself to stop hitting Sylvia, he couldn't rise up out of himself entirely. He didn't like any inkling that he was being disrespected in his home. He would feel overwhelmed by the need to assert his control. He would lose his temper and his palms would start sweating, and if not Sylvia then someone else was going to bear the brunt of it.
"I guess I kind of switched my pattern toward the kids," Michael mumbled, fingering his wisp of a mustache. He was embarrassed. He glanced over at Sylvia, who was asleep in the brass bed in the adjacent bedroom. Fully dressed, she was underneath a fluffy quilt blocking out all conversation, since she had just come home from work at a group home for disabled adults and was due to head out to a second shift, an all-nighter. Their daughters, 15 and 11, were in their rooms, giggling with friends.
"I would spank them," Michael said. "It started as spanking. But I overdid it." 
One night a couple of years ago, his older daughter, then 12, crossed some kind of a line and angered him; Michael doesn't remember the precipitating incident. Her daughter really angered Michael, Sylvia told me later. "She was a big girl, too old to be spanked. But he spanked her anyway, and worse." Michael beat his daughter with a stick. 
The girl, who is overweight and very sensitive, was hurt physically and devastated emotionally. When she went to school the next day, she showed her bruises to a teacher. The school called the child-welfare authorities. They took away the girls and put them in a foster home. Sylvia was furious and sad. Michael said he was disgusted with himself, the old familiar remorse that would sweep over him like a wave of nausea after he struck Sylvia. 
Looking back, Sylvia draws from her bottomless supply of compassion for Michael, but it is hard-edged. "I don't think Michael intended to hurt the child," she said. "He never intended to hurt me either. But in the eyes of society today, abuse is abuse, and if you don't fix things in your own home, the system's going to fix it for you."
After a few weeks the girls returned home, and Michael left for several weeks on the court's order. He and Sylvia were made to take a parenting class. During the intake process, Michael acknowledged his history of domestic abuse. It was the first time Michael had ever identified himself to the authorities as a batterer. He was put on a waiting list for a batterers group.
Then, in the spring of 2001, while he was still waiting for a group to open up, Michael got into an argument with one of the housekeepers he supervised at a Manhattan hotel where he is facility manager. She wanted the weekend off, and he turned her down. He claims that she began swinging at him, he grabbed her hands and she kneed him. He then punched her "out of reflex," he said, breaking her eye socket. "When I saw the damage I inflicted on her. . . . She was a beautiful young lady, and after I struck her, it was like the beauty and the beast," Michael said. The police came. Michael was handcuffed, jailed for a night, charged and released. Despite his disgust with himself, it angered him that the police didn't arrest the housekeeper, too, because, he said, she had started it. 
The system treated the case as a domestic assault, assuming that Michael and his subordinate were boyfriend and girlfriend and that Michael was the "primary physical aggressor." He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. His bosses at the hotel, where he has worked for 18 years, suspended him for two months and ordered him to go for counseling. Since the hotel was willing to pay for counseling, Michael was able to forget about the waiting list for a free class and enroll in a private program in Brooklyn. 
Although Michael resisted at first, he came to see the group as his salvation. Schulder -- "Miss Ruth" to Michael -- led it along with "Mr. Q," Quentin Walcott. "I don't know what it was about Michael, but he was driven to be honest," Walcott says. "That really helped the group dynamic." Michael found it an exhilarating revelation to consider that his behavior was learned and could be unlearned. He was not crazy and he was not doomed. Battering was a choice.
Sylvia says the program started Michael soul-searching, which was alien to him. "They put everything in perspective for him, and he was amazed. He would talk to me about his past and how much it damaged him and how he could finally put it behind him." Still, Sylvia said, Michael did not undergo a miracle transformation. He continues to say things he shouldn't say and think in ways that undermine him. "When his job stresses him out, I tell him, "Honey, your title means a lot," Sylvia says. "You are a professional. Act like a professional."' Michael cools down by taking walks around the block. He takes a lot of walks around the block.
When I first met Michael, he struck me as a man who was tormented by the consequences of his abusive behavior. He didn't like it that his daughter kept reminding him that she had a lawyer's number in her pocket, that she had rights, that he couldn't touch her. He didn't like it when his subordinates at work teased him if he tried to discipline them. "Don't be thinking you can do us like you did" that housekeeper, they'd say. Yet he was driven to be confessional, to hold himself accountable for his behavior.
He talks to himself every morning when he brushes his teeth, he told me, trying to focus his energy on how it's in his best interest to keep his cool, to be "a man in the new way I understand that word." It seems to me that a combination of forces over many years -- Sylvia laying down the law, the city's taking away his kids, his arrest at work and the subsequent treatment program -- has finally convinced him how much is at stake. "I don't want to lose my wife, I don't want to lose my girls and I don't want to lose my job," he says. "I don't want to hurt no one no more no way."
Whether his motivation will be sufficiently powerful to overcome a lifelong pattern remains to be seen. For the moment, Michael and Sylvia are setting their sights on a more concrete goal: a vacation in the Poconos.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN; 
Los Angeles

BYLINE:  By By RICK LYMAN; RICK LYMAN is a culture correspondent in the Los Angeles bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
Looming above the northwest edge of the sunken freeway loop surrounding downtown Los Angeles, the imposing new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels looks less ecclesiastical than utilitarian, like one of those windowless telecommunications behemoths designed to keep the internal wiring cool.
 At street level, though, and as one wanders through its shimmering interior, the recently opened centerpiece of the nation's largest Roman Catholic archdiocese is rather marvelous -- a modernist fusion of light, texture and imagery that seems truly drawn from the ethnically and economically diverse megalopolis. 
 The well-known truth about Los Angeles is that it is much more a place to be than a collection of places to go. Still, when visitors come to the city, they insist on going places. It's the tourist's duty, after all. And the longtime standbys -- like the ghostly cement footprints outside Grauman's Chinese Theater (back to its original name after several years as Mann's Chinese), a stroll on the Santa Monica Pier or, perhaps best of all, the serpentine panorama of Mulholland Drive on a clear day -- go only so far. 
So new destinations are always handy, and the cathedral, which opened in September, also provides a fresh reason to visit the city's fascinating and often overlooked downtown. It can be easily combined with an excursion to, say, the lively Grand Central Market and nearby Bradbury Building, 304 South Broadway, an atrium office building of wrought iron and skylights that is one of Los Angeles's architectural treasures, and a stroll through the Museum of Contemporary Art.
Once downtown, visitors can also peer at the unfinished new Walt Disney Concert Hall by Frank Gehry, set to open in the fall of 2003 -- a clash of glimmering curves and colliding planes that looks like Mr. Gehry's ego doing battle with Disney's, and emerging triumphant.

Events
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 5905 Wilshire Boulevard, (323) 857-6000, www.lacma.org, is offering an exhibition through Jan. 5 that gets to the very heart of the city's self-image as a modern trendsetter. "A Century of Fashion: 1900-2000" begins with corseted Victorians and passes by flappers and hippies before ending at what the museum calls "a globalization of style and a minimalist approach from multinational designers." Admission, $7, and everyone is admitted free on the second Tuesday of every month. The museum is open noon to 8 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, noon to 9 p.m. on Friday and 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.
A revival of the Tony-winning musical "Big River," performed to much acclaim in 2001 by the Deaf West Theater in North Hollywood, is being presented by the Center Theater Group's Mark Taper Forum, 135 North Grand Avenue, (213) 625-2772, www.centertheatregroup.com. The show has music and lyrics by Roger Miller and a book by William Hauptman; the choreographer and director Jeff Calhoun of the Deaf West Theater has reimagined it with a cast that includes hearing-impaired performers. Tickets are $40 and $50 weekends, $35 and $45 during the week. The show is scheduled to run through Dec. 29. 
The Museum of Contemporary Art, 250 South Grand Avenue, (213) 626-6222, www.moca-la.org, is featuring the photography of the German artist Thomas Struth through Jan. 5. His stark, sometimes eerie photographs are of buildings, flowers, landscapes, individuals and, most famously, museums. General admission, $8; open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday, except for Thursday when it closes at 8 p.m.
"Million Dollar Cars: The World's Most Valuable Automobiles" is parked at the Petersen Automotive Museum, 6060 Wilshire Boulevard, (323) 930-2277, www.petersen.org, through Jan. 26. On view are a 1939 Bugatti 57C that the French government presented as a wedding gift to the shah of Iran, a 1938 Mercedes Benz 540K Special Roadster once owned by the movie mogul Jack Warner and Steve McQueen's 1956 Jaguar XKSS. General admission, $10; Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.

Sightseeing
The 57,000-square-foot Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, 555 West Temple Street, (213) 680-5200, www.olacathedral.org, rises 128 feet above the northwest rim of downtown Los Angeles. Highlights include the great bronze doors designed by the Los Angeles sculptor Robert Graham, a life-size bronze crucifix by Simon Toparvsky and 27,000 square feet of alabaster windows that shed a creamy light. Open weekdays 6:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
The Grove at the Farmers Market, 6333 West Third Street, (323) 933-9211, www.shopthegrove.com, is wrapped around the eastern end of the venerable Farmers Market, and features a trolley car on its main thoroughfare and shops like F.A.O. Schwarz, Nordstrom and Oliviers & Co. The most affordable attraction here is the people watching. Open Monday through Thursday 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., Friday and Saturday 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sunday 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
This is also the heart of the taping season for those television series, mostly sit-coms, that tape before a studio audience. Tickets are free, but a certain amount of patience is required since audiences must arrive early, line up and watch as some scenes are shot multiple times and cast members shuttle between sets on the sound stage. Also, most shows do not admit those under 18.
A good place to check for tickets is the Internet site www.tvtickets.com, or (818) 753-3480, which offers tickets to many current hits like "Everybody Loves Raymond" and "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter." You simply fill out the form and print out the tickets, along with the long list of rules and security regulations that accompany them. 
A good place to spot actual Angelenos at play is the Arclight Cinemas, 6360 West Sunset Boulevard, (323) 464-1478, www.arclightcinemas.com, one of a new breed of upscale Los Angeles cinemas. The Arclight charges $11 but offers such amenities as reserved seating, state-of-the-art sound and projection technology in 14 auditoriums and a popular cafe and retail store. Adjacent is the recently refurbished Cinerama Dome cinema.

Where to Stay
For the trend-inclined, there is the new 207-room Downtown LA Standard, 550 South Flower Street, (213) 892-8080, fax (213) 892-8686, www.standardhotel.com, a sister to the original Standard on the Sunset Strip. It opened in May with the same wacky touches and retro-1960's feel, including platform beds, magenta sofas and brightly hued artificial turf poolside. Its rooftop bar is crowded late into the night with the young and beautiful. Doubles start at $165.
Not far away, but seeming to be in a different universe, is the 188-room Wyndham Checkers, to become Hilton Checkers next month, 535 South Grand Avenue, (800) 423-5798, fax (213) 626-9906, www.checkershotel.com, a small, European-style place with an antiques-filled lobby and rooms with Old World furniture and thick, flowery comforters. Doubles start at $219. 
Budget: The Inn at Venice Beach, 327 Washington Boulevard, Venice, (800) 828-0688, fax (310) 827-0289, www.innatvenicebeach.com, is a comfortable 43-room hotel a few blocks from the ocean and near several bars, restaurants and beach shops. The rooms have high ceilings and country-style furnishings. Doubles start at $99, suites at $129.
Luxury: A stone's throw from the Pacific, the Casa del Mar, 1910 Ocean Front Way, Santa Monica, (800) 898-6999, fax (310) 581-5503, www.hotelcasadelmar.com, is in a grand Atlantic City-style edifice painstakingly restored to its 1920's Italian Renaissance Revival feel. Many of the 129 rooms, with heavy wooden furniture and antique appointments, look out onto the ocean, and the hotel has a pool. Doubles start at $370 without an ocean view, $545 with.
The St. Regis Los Angeles Hotel and Spa, 2055 Avenue of the Stars, (310) 277-6111, fax (310) 277-3711, www.stregis.com, is in a modern high rise in Century City, overlooking the 20th Century Fox movie lot. The art-filled lobby and 297 guest rooms, all with private balconies, come with such amenities as a butler to assist in unpacking and 300-thread-count bed linens. Doubles start at $299.
Where to Eat
Los Angeles restaurants tend to boast about their local ingredients and their particular brand of European or Asian inspired California cuisine. A recent example, which opened in the sprawling space long occupied by Citrus, is Alex, 6703 Melrose Avenue, (323) 933-5233, www.alexrestaurant.com. The rooms are mahogany-lined, but the ambience is comfortably casual. You can start with a goat cheese souffle with caramelized pear and a grilled langoustine and herb salad. Main courses include crispy skinned Arctic char with golden tomato compote and Santa Barbara spot prawn nage. Among the dessert choices is lemongrass creme brulee. With a moderate bottle of wine, the total for a dinner for two will be about $180, plus tax and tip; a four-course prix fixe dinner is $60 a person, without wine. The restaurant is open for lunch Wednesday through Friday and for dinner Monday through Saturday.
Ventura Boulevard between Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Universal City is sushi row. A popular stop is Tama Sushi, 11920 Ventura Boulevard, (818) 760-4585, austere and modernist with light-brown wood and cream-colored walls contrasting with the charcoal carpeting and jet-black tablecloths. Appetizers include octopus and cucumber salad, and a delicious Pacific lobster salad, and among the main courses are a seafood hot pot and beef sukiyaki. But sushi is the real star, with specials including a yellowtail in wasabi cream or a shrimp crunch roll. There is an extensive sake list, too. Dinner with a couple of glasses of wine or sake, is $50 to $75 for two. Lunch and dinner Monday to Saturday. 
Bustling and aromatic is the downtown Water Grill, 544 South Grand Avenue; (213) 891-0900. Boasting some of the freshest seafood in the city, and the widest selection, the storefront is almost always packed with downtown power brokers. Adorned with paintings of the sea, the 1920's-era room in the main floor of an ornate downtown office building is a soothing blend of weathered wood and green tiles. Freshness is stressed, so the menu changes regularly. A recent highlight was a delicious filet of sea bass in a surprisingly spicy red-curry sauce. The selection of oysters is always extensive. Dinner for two will run about $130 plus tax and tip. Lunch and dinner weekdays, dinner weekends.
But if you want to know where Angelenos really eat, take a trip to Du-Par's Restaurants and Bakeries inside the Farmers Market at Third Street and Fairfax Avenue (one of three locations), (323) 933-8446, www.dupars.com, which is known for its breakfasts, including terrific French toast. The Farmers Market is open daily 6 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.
A more eccentric choice is Roscoe's House of Chicken N Waffles, at four locations including 1514 North Gower Street in Hollywood, (323) 466-7453. Besides huge breakfasts, Roscoe's offers fried chicken smothered in gravy and onions with two waffles ($7.30). Monday to Thursday 8:30 a.m. to midnight, Friday and Saturday 8:30 a.m. to 4 a.m. and Sunday noon to midnight.

On a slope between Vienna's car-clogged W* hringerstrasse and the green ribbon of its Danube Canal are several city blocks filled with the six-story Biedermeier buildings one sees everywhere here. There are one or two exquisite Baroque-style buildings and a few monstrosities from the Bauhaus era, but otherwise Berggasse seems like just another anonymous working-class street in a European capital.
 Berggasse might escape the attentions of all but its own residents, in fact, had it not been the locus operandi for two of the 20th century's most significant social movements. 
 Sigmund Freud spent nearly his entire working life at 19 Berggasse. From 1891 until 1938, he developed his theory of psychoanalysis here, famously writing his books and treating his patients in comfortable rooms on the building's second floor. 
Less well known is the fact that, among Freud's neighbors, living at 6 Berggasse from around 1896 to 1898, was Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism. Literary editor and Paris correspondent of the Neue Freie Presse, Europe's leading liberal newspaper at the time, Herzl published his tract "The Jewish State" in 1896 and lived on Berggasse, like Freud, as a celebrated giant and a derided crank.
(The two never met, although Freud dreamed of Herzl; and although Herzl ignored the copy of "The Interpretation of Dreams" Freud sent him, hoping for a review, Freud did psychoanalyze Herzl's son, Hans, years later, diagnosing the suicidal youth as suffering, not surprisingly, from a profound Oedipal conflict.)
Nothing commemorates the time Herzl spent on Berggasse, no plaque adorns the facade of No. 6. Indeed, one might search Vienna in vain looking for any public mention of his name. Zionists with a sense of history will have to settle for a slice of pizza at the Pizzeria Valentino or a drink at the Italian cocktail bar on No. 6's ground floor.
In contrast, the Freud Museum seems to form the cultural and economic epicenter of present-day Berggasse. Entering the building's Hapsburg-yellow foyer with its frosted, stenciled windows and its sinuous, black, vinelike stair railings, I'm overtaken by an overwhelming sense of dominating presence, a palpable spirit of place, and before I can shrug it off as deriving from my own imagination, my wife, Basha, says to me, "Did you feel that?"
We climb the stairs and ring the bell, as Dora and the Rat Man once did, and are soon in the rooms where Freud spent nearly 40 years, before he and his family were driven from their country by the Nazi SS and local collaborators.
Freud took the apartment's furnishings to London when he fled, and they remained there until 1968, when, on a trip to the United States, Josef Klaus, the Austrian chancellor, was embarrassed by questions about Vienna's conspicuous lack of Freudian commemoration. 
Responding to the Austrian government's request, Freud's daughter Anna returned the furniture from her father's waiting room, along with 79 pieces of his extensive collection of antiquities. (The rest, kept in London, are now on exhibit in the Freud Museum there.) The waiting room, restored in the mid-1990's, is where Freud and the members of his Vienna Psychoanalytic Society held their Wednesday evening meetings, the men seated on its plush, burgundy-upholstered sofa and chairs.
Although Berggasse had been, at the turn of the century, a step up for Jews like Herzl and Freud, who moved there from the ethnic slums of the Leopoldstadt, behind the Prater on the far side of the canal, the street grew decidedly working-class in the wake of Vienna's post-World War II occupation.
Ten years ago, when Massi Baumgartner moved his playfully contemporary furniture shop, Massi Design und Handels, into 30 Berggasse, the building was a -- unable to remember the English, Massi sends his ponytailed assistant bouncing back into the showroom for a German-English dictionary; after consulting it, she returns to the sidewalk where we're standing to utter the words he needs -- "coal shop." Now Massi's streamlined designs fill the light and airy showroom: shelves of elegant glass bowls and vases, desk lamps resembling Picasso's sketches of Don Quixote, a wall of light bulbs with wings.
The street is gentrifying, Massi tells us, nodding to an exquisitely white Baroque-style building near the Freud house. The restored ground floor, which was once an auto-parts factory, will soon display custom-made English furniture. Although the coal shop and other businesses have been forced from the street, elbowed out by more fashionable replacements, like an ergonomic furniture store, a few holdouts from the postwar years remain. Next to Massi's is a dingy shoemaker's shop, and across the street is a uniform shop for firemen.
Near the top of the hill, at 3 Berggasse, is an army surplus store called Gelegenheitsschwemme. Every shelf and bin in its closetlike rooms is bursting with military merchandise, both new and antique, mostly from the Austrian Army, although there are many items from the United States, Russian and German armies, as well as Dutch trousers, Belgian shoes and Italian jackets.
Kurt Hellmann inherited the store from his parents, who opened the shop in 1955 when the British, American, French and Russian occupying forces left Austria. In the wake of the Allies' withdrawal, Kurt's father came into possession of thousands of pairs of boots that he had to raffle off, so great was the demand for decent footwear in the ravaged Vienna of that time, and that is how the store was born.
"And where do you get your merchandise these days?" I ask.
"We have to have some secrets," Kurt tells me.
Perhaps most emblematic of this era in the street's history is Mobel Beer, at 32 Berggasse (Freud's famous patient Dora is said to have onced lived here). A block from the canal, at the corner of Hahngasse, Mobel Beer is an enormous secondhand shop run by Charlotte Beer.
Signs in the windows proclaim the bargains within: "Alle Mobel um 50% billiger!!!" and "Alles zum halben Preis."
Plastic laundry bins of used clothing and tablecloths line its front walk. A canister of canes shares space with a tray of clocks and one of silverware and one of tools. Basha finds a pair of lace tablecloths, one hand-embroidered, both elegant, and pays around $2 for each of them.
The interior is dark and dusty for an Austrian shop, which is to say hardly dark and dusty at all, but darker and less dusty than the newer shops down the road.
For $100, you can buy a pair of big, sturdy armoires. "The only problem would be shipping them," Basha says, as we reluctantly leave without having made a sizable purchase.
The restaurants on Berggasse seem to reflect its changing face as well. There's a Cafe Freud, of course, next to the Freud Museum, and two sushi restaurants peek out from a couple of side streets. There are places for Chinese food and fish and a Mexican restaurant serving, according to its sign, "Acapulco Mexikanische Spezialit* tan." There's a gay coffeehouse called Berg at 8 Berggasse that turns into a gay bar at night. A discreet pink triangle is incorporated into the sign it shares with Lowenherz, the gay bookstore next door. 
There are cafes on every block and more than half a dozen traditional Wiener kuchen, all with outdoor seating. The most inviting of these is Wiener Beisl, at 24 Berggasse. Its menu features traditional Austrian specialties along with reasonably priced vegetarian dishes.
At the foot of Berggasse, along the canal, is a bike trail that runs all the way to Germany. Sitting on a bench, Basha and I enviously watch the cyclists who whiz by on one of the 1,500 free "Vienna bikes" supplied by the city. 
Overlooking the slow waters of the canal, a bar called Summer Stage has concerts and art exhibits in its glass pavilion. Six sculptures rotate on motorized pedestals in the sculpture garden. Nearby is a sandy volleyball court next to a trampoline station for children. Parents heft large beers and eat nachos while the kids grow dizzy and faint.
There's no knowing what Freud and Herzl would make of their old street; no knowing what Freud would mutter to himself as he passed Die Philosophie im Boudoir, an erotica shop with a mural over its front door depicting a half-dressed peasant girl sneaking coquettishly into bed; no knowing if Herzl would stop in at the Persian rug shop at 14 Berggasse and shake his head over the current situation in the Middle East with its proprietor, Dr. Mohammi. But there's probably no better street in the world on which to sit in a cafe over a kaffee melange and wonder about such things.

HEADLINE: A Tale Of Two Moscows 

BYLINE:  By JANUSZ GLOWACKI; Janusz Glowacki is a Polish playwright who moved to New York in 1984. His plays include "Cinders," "Hunting Cockroaches" and "Antigone in New York."

 BODY:
ALONGSIDE the Moscow River, near Gorky Park, positioned several feet above the highway, stands a cutout of a life-size man in a business suit, hands forward, ready to jump. Under him reads an inscription: "Before you jump, think again. Take a Stresstab." 
 In our age of globalization, perhaps the one thing that truly connects the whole world, more than the Internet, pop culture or so-called free trade, is that sinking feeling, that urge to jump. Russia has been depressed for centuries; today, with terrorism, a sputtering economy and cultural anomie, America is catching up. 
 My new play, "The Fourth Sister," was inspired by Chekhov's "Three Sisters," but it is neither a fictional continuation, nor a new version, nor a pastiche of Chekhov. It's merely an ironic allusion to his play and points out a few depressing steps the world has made since Chekhov gazed upon it. 
The underlying conviction of Chekhov's characters was that, although their own world was filled with trials and suffering, their children's would be a better one. It was easier for Chekhov to have some hope for the future at the end of the 19th century, when the concepts of truth, honor, commitment and love were seriously embraced. (Sometimes too seriously, since Russian officers at that time had duels when they offended each other, and shot themselves in the head when women rejected them.)
But today's Moscow has very little to do with Chekhov's Moscow. There are no more troikas and very few lofty dreams. I was in Moscow about four years ago, when Russia was preparing for war with Chechnya. I walked through the center of Moscow with Svetlana, the 14-year-old daughter of the driver from the Ministry of Culture who was chauffeuring me around the city. We passed a disco called Hammer and Sickle; Giorgio Armani's store; a Mafia-looking restaurant, Up and Down; a dealer for Rolls-Royces; and Afghan vets lining the streets, panhandling. These war heroes had medals but no legs. They gloomily looked on as policemen, who used to chase criminals, saluted Mafiosos lounging in black stretch limos. In the 21st century, a fifth substance, money, triumphs over the four ancient elements of fire, water, earth and air.
The day before, a bomb exploded in Moscow. The Chechens were blamed. But people whispered that it was actually the K.G.B., since it wanted to justify the impending war and deflect attention from the nation's poverty. Svetlana shook with anger. As several ambulances and armored cars passed us, she furiously told me that she read recently that the greatest artist of the 20th century was Yves St. Laurent. She said: "No way! Any idiot knows that Versace was the one."
Maybe Nietzsche was right when he said that humor is the epitaph on the grave of a painful memory. I wrote this play out of despair -- maybe that's why it's funny. One of the fathers of the theater of the absurd, Samuel Beckett, after surviving both wars, decided that Godot will never come and that nothing is funnier than misfortune. Though Chekhov lived in the 19th century, this sentiment wasn't foreign to him, either, except his laughter has always been filled with compassion.
During Communist times, when I still lived in Warsaw, the Minister of Culture censored a comedy I wrote. When I asked why, he explained that he realized that laughter was necessary, and that he himself laughed every day for 10 minutes -- with a stopwatch in hand -- for the purpose of mental hygiene. But he professed that there are only two kinds of laughter: constructive (or pro-Communist) and destructive (or anti-Communist). I hope "The Fourth Sister" falls into a third category.
In "The Fourth Sister," which opens on Thursday Off Broadway at the Vineyard Theater, the most recurring line is "I'm depressed," a seemingly strange line for a comedy. In fact, I'm not sure if my play is a comedy or a tragedy, but the difference between them is sometimes nettlesome to define.
You see, one character in the play, a retired general who once fought in Berlin and Kabul, tries to get work as a model to pay for his youngest daughter's dance lessons. The oldest daughter is the sex-pet of a married politician who hates Jews, though he himself is half-Jewish. The middle daughter finished law school and now feeds animals in the circus. Just a few years earlier, they knew what to expect from life. Now, they are at a loss.
The third and youngest daughter, Tania, has a better setup. Although she confuses Dostoyevsky with Versace and Bulgakov with Britney Spears, she has a moral guiding force in her life: the movie "Pretty Woman" with Julia Roberts. Back in the old days, prostitutes pretended to be virgins. In our times, virgins pretend to be prostitutes.
Tania once went to a museum and the only painting that caught her attention was one by Marc Chagall in which a boy hangs upside-down with one shoe. Perhaps it reminded her of something. Tania doesn't get emotional over the death of 30 women and children burned alive by a car bomb. But that doesn't mean she's callous. She just probably already used up all her tears by crying for five days, along with the entire planet, over the death of Princess Di. I read in one newspaper that 9/11 yanked at the hearts of Europeans almost as tragically as the death of the Princess. In "The Fourth Sister," naturalism blends with surrealism, and here too, the difference between them has become rather impossible to define.
Chekhov had doubts about whether he had the moral privilege to write, since he couldn't even answer the basic question: "How should we live?"
In my play, the retired Russian general asks far simpler questions: "Who rules here? Where is the money? How will it all end?" And no one is in a hurry to answer him.
I decided that my play about Moscow would begin in Hollywood, at the Academy Awards ceremony, which is broadcast all over the world, and has become part of our new global inter-connectedness, along with CNN. CNN is watched by those who blow up embassies and those who protect embassies, those who take hostages and those who rescue them. An Egyptian writer I met in New York said he was addicted to American television. He knew more than I did about O. J. Simpson and Washington interns, but he was truly amazed to find out that there were some religious New Yorkers.
Others have no access to television, like the children of Moscow who live in sewers and soiled public restrooms. Those kids are usually missing all their teeth, but they know how to use guns. Today, kids all over take aim at an early age. Those in Moscow shoot to get a pack of Marlboros. At the Mafia's request, they kill people they have never seen before. Since they are children, they sometimes make mistakes, killing the wrong people. But actually, the Mafia itself also messes up on occasion because it is overworked.
In Moscow, many photographers and film directors roam the streets, documenting stories about the Mafia and child prostitution. I put one of these directors in my play. He received an Oscar for the gripping candidness of his documentary, "The Children of Moscow," about child prostitution in Russia. Only, in today's times, the difference between truth and falsehood has become almost impossible to define.
I brought back home the two most popular toys in Russia. One was given to me by my driver, Svetlana's father. It was Wanka Wstanka, a kind of Russian superman. Push him to the side and he always springs back into his standing, ready position. "Watch out," the driver said, "nobody'll beat Russia." The second one I bought on my own. It was the famous Matrioshka, a colorful doll that holds inside of her another smaller version of herself but with a different face. Inside that smaller version, another face appears, and yet another one, and so on. I wonder what kind of face Russia will show in the coming years.
At the end of the 19th century, Chekhov wrote that Russians love the past, hate the present and fear the future. They don't realize when the future becomes the present that they hate so much and, a moment later, the past, which they miss.
For Chekhov's "Three Sisters," the magical place that gave them hope of a better life and happiness was Moscow. For me, when I lived in Warsaw during Communist times, the promised land was America. In "The Fourth Sister," the characters don't know where to go.

The Fourth Sister
Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street. In previews; opens on Thursday; closes Dec. 8.

Chekhov All Week
JANUSZ GLOWACKI has said about his new play, "The Fourth Sister," that it is neither a version of nor a continuation of Chekhov's "Three Sisters," but rather an ironic allusion to Chekhov. 
The life and works of the man himself are being celebrated this month in the fourth annual Chekhov Now Festival at the Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, in the East Village. Performances are in their final week, through next Sunday. In addition to productions of "The Cherry Orchard" and "Three Sisters," there is a "sequel" to "The Cherry Orchard" and a gay musical adaptation of "Three Sisters." 
The LITE Theater Company (Laboratory for International Theater Exchange) is presenting the festival. Here are some of the productions: 
* "The Ghost of Firs Nikolaich," a sequel to "The Cherry Orchard," by Sam Mossler. A Dream Out Loud production directed by Tim Herman. What happens to those trees. 2 p.m. today and 5 p.m. next Sunday.
* "Moscow," a musical adaptation of "Three Sisters" by Nick Salomone and Mary R. McIntyre in which three gay men are trapped in a deserted theater with a script of the Chekhov play. 8 p.m. tomorrow and 10 p.m. Friday.
* "Gull," an Ellen Beckerman & Company production, directed by Ms. Beckerman. A hit at the festival two years ago, it focuses on the text of "The Seagull," and has minimal movement and design. 8 p.m. today and Thursday; 5 p.m. Saturday; 2 p.m. next Sunday.
* "Rothschild's Fiddle" and "The Lady With the Dog," a double bill. "Fiddle," based on Chekhov's novella of the same name, is an adaptation by Judythe Cohen and the festival's artistic director, Adam Melnick, set in pre-revolutionary Russia among peasants and their Jewish neighbors. "Lady" is adapted from a Chekhov short story about a married woman who has an affair while on a holiday in Yalta. 8 p.m. Tuesday and 8 p.m. Friday.

Making Images Other Than His Own

BYLINE:  By FRED BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
IN his three runs for district attorney of Los Angeles, Gil Garcetti counted on the local ironworkers' union for support. So last year, when Mr. Garcetti phoned the union's business manager, Jack Holt, Mr. Holt answered not with "Hello" but with "We'll send you $1,000," Mr. Garcetti said here recently.
 In fact, Mr. Garcetti wanted permission to photograph the 130 ironworkers helping to build the Walt Disney Concert Hall, Frank Gehry's magnum opus in downtown Los Angeles, which is to open next year. Voted out of office in 2000, Mr. Garcetti was spending his days taking black-and-white photos at the construction site. 
 This wouldn't be much of a story -- unemployed lawyer finds hobby -- if Mr. Garcetti's work hadn't struck a chord. One hundred of his photos have been published as "Iron: Erecting the Walt Disney Concert Hall" (Balcony Press, $40). The Peter Fetterman Gallery in Santa Monica, Calif., which represents the likes of Sebastiao Salgado and Elliott Erwitt, has scheduled a show of Mr. Garcetti's work, opening on Dec. 7. And his images have won rave reviews, not only from Mr. Gehry but also from the renowned architectural photographer Julius Shulman, who called them "remarkable."
Theodore Stebbins Jr., a curator of American art at Harvard's Fogg Art Museum, said: "I was amazed by Gil Garcetti's photographs, which go back to Lewis Hine and especially to Charles Sheeler. But his images are not derivative."
Mr. Garcetti is the latest in a long line of photographers to find beauty in unfinished buildings. Mr. Shulman, 92, also compares Mr. Garcetti's work with that of Lewis Hine, who created revered images of the Empire State Building and Rockefeller Center being built.
Architecturally, Mr. Garcetti may have the best subject of all: an astonishingly complex assemblage of 12,500 pieces of steel, no two the same, ranging in length from several inches to hundreds of feet, and welded together at every conceivable angle. Photographed in contrasty black-and-white, the girders resemble the brushstrokes of an abstract painting.
Most architects dislike having their buildings photographed before they are finished, Mr. Shulman said. But Mr. Gehry, speaking from Los Angeles, said he was glad that the structure now disappearing under the concert hall's titanium skin has been documented by Mr. Garcetti. In an introduction to Mr. Garcetti's book, Mr. Gehry notes that two "windows" inside the hall will offer glimpses of the structure, but nothing like the sweeping views available during construction.
Mr. Garcetti is as interested in the ironworkers as in the iron; his best photos reveal humanity and geometry in equal measure. In that respect, they are reminiscent of Mr. Hine's photos, which have been credited with dignifying the American Indian ironworkers who labored to erect New York's tall buildings.
Given the complexity of Mr. Gehry's design, Mr. Garcetti said, the Disney Concert Hall drew California's finest ironworkers: 129 men and 1 woman, each a tightrope walker, weight lifter and engineer. "I wanted others to feel the awe I felt watching these workers," Mr. Garcetti said.
During his eight years as Los Angeles district attorney, Mr. Garcetti was involved in the prosecution of O. J. Simpson and the aftermath of the trials of the officers accused of beating Rodney King. This fall, he is teaching a seminar at Harvard on, as he puts it, "the interaction of the criminal justice system with politics and race." In his apartment here, he showed off several of his black-and-white photos, most of which he printed in a Santa Monica darkroom. Donning a pair of white cotton gloves ("my Michael Jackson moment," said Mr. Garcetti, who declined to prosecute Mr. Jackson when he was accused of child abuse), he unwrapped the photos, stood them on his lap, then handed them to his wife, Sukey, a foundation president, to return them to their wrappers.
Mr. Garcetti says he doesn't know what he will do professionally when he returns to Los Angeles next month. Although he does not plan to practice law, he is a presence at several law firms, which have bought his prints (at $950 to $1,250 each) to hang on their office walls.
As for photography, he wants to see where it leads him. Mr. Shulman, who has introduced Mr. Garcetti at several book parties, said, "he's had a joyful, glorious reincarnation."

In Weak Market, Strong Demand for Medical Offices

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
AS other developers hasten to build more housing for the increasing number of older residents remaining in Westchester instead of retiring elsewhere, Robert P. Weisz is tapping into a directly related, and growing, real estate market: medical office space.
 In the past year, Mr. Weisz, the developer, owner and manager of about one million square feet of prime office space in Westchester and Fairfield, has acquired 190,000 square feet of medical office properties a short drive from the White Plains Hospital Center here. Mr. Weisz paid $26.4 million for the five buildings and an undeveloped 7.5-acre parcel on a stretch of Westchester Avenue known as Platininum Mile -- a premier strip of offices that was home for many years in the 1970's and 80's to Fortune 500 companies. 
 On the vacant land, Mr. Weisz plans to build a $15 million, 75,000-square-foot medical office building. He said it would be the first new Class A office project built for leasing to multiple tenants in Westchester since 1988, when many corporate giants began to downsize and some moved away. 
Since the recession of the late 80's and early 90's, the city has struggled with a high office vacancy rate -- more than 30 percent at times. The rate now in White Plains is 20.7 percent, as of the third quarter of this year.
By contrast, the office buildings Mr. Weisz recently purchased are almost fully occupied and have been for several years, although that was not the case before they became medical complexes. "Like many other buildings in the city, those along Westchester Avenue that are now owned by Mr. Weisz have reacted in the past to the ebbs and flows of the office market," said Glenn P. Walsh, a senior director for Cushman & Wakefield.
Mr. Walsh, whose company is the leasing agent for the properties, said the recently acquired buildings are the only large medical office complexes in the county. "There are smaller buildings scattered between White Plains and outlying areas," he said. "Wherever there's a hospital, we see a cluster of smaller medical offices, but there's nothing else in Westchester of this scope." In his first medical office acquisition earlier this year, Mr. Weisz bought 244 Westchester Avenue, a 20-year-old, 90,000-square-foot building, along with the undeveloped land, for $13.6 million from Ivy Equities, based in Clifton, N.J. In addition to constructing a new office building on the property, the developer plans to spend another $1 million for improvements to the existing four-story glass and anodized aluminum building. 
In the second acquisition, which occurred last month, Mr. Weisz purchased Harrison Court, a 100,000-square-foot complex of four buildings at 222, 224, 226 and 230 Westchester Avenue. He acquired the complex for $13 million from GE Capital, which had acquired it through foreclosure in the early 1990's. Mr. Weisz will invest another $7 million to upgrade the 40-year-old brick complex of one- to five-story brick buildings. 
Mr. Weisz, who founded his company, the RPW Group, here 25 years ago, attributed the high occupancy rate of the recently acquired medical office buildings to the changing demographics in Westchester. Figures from the Westchester Department of Senior Programs and Services show that more than 170,000 residents -- 18 percent of the population, a high rate -- are 60 years or older. Those numbers are expected to increase steadily through 2025 as the baby boom generation ages out.
"Because many of these older residents are choosing to stay where they already have ties to the community, we're seeing a parallel need for more geriatric medical services in the county," the developer said.
The effects of that trend can also be seen in downtown White Plains, where 1,700 new apartment units are expected to be built over the next several years. Much of the new housing stock is being marketed to older residents who have already raised a family and no longer want to own a large home, but who do not want to follow previous generations of retirees to places like Florida, Arizona and, more recently, the Carolinas.
Metropolitan Lithotriptor Associates, the medical arm of Allied Urological Services, is typical of medical practices that have grown in recent years in large part in response to the shifting demographics and have moved into the buildings recently purchased by Mr. Weisz. The company, which rents 2,700 square feet at 222 Westchester Avenue, treats patients with kidney and prostate ailments, said Jodie Corngold, the company's spokeswoman. It also specializes in an outpatient surgery known as lithotripsy, which uses shockwaves to crush kidney stones. 
In 1998, when it first leased space in Harrison Court, Metropolitan Lithotriptor Associates treated 200 patients. Today, Ms. Corngold said, the Westchester branch -- the company also has offices on Long Island and in Manhattan -- sees 650 patients a year, many of them 50 years old and over.
Ms. Corngold attributed the growth of medical practices like Metropolitan Lithotriptor Associates in part to advances in medical technology that permit ambulatory surgeries like lithotripsy to be performed outside of hospitals. Although the procedure requires that a patient be anesthetized, it can be performed in a doctor's office. The firm owns the costly machinery needed to perform the surgery, and 50 urologists from Connecticut and Westchester and Putnam Counties use its White Plains office, which is next to Interstate 287 and is close to several other major highways.
Mr. Walsh of Cushman & Wakefield said the location of the medical complexes on the outskirts of the city, but less than a 10 minute drive from White Plains Hospital Center, is better for both patients and doctors than downtown White Plains, where traffic is often heavy and parking for patients is in short supply. 
LAST month, the hospital center itself opened its first breast imaging center outside downtown. In part, the establishment of the new center in Rye Brook is a response to the drop in the number of local doctors providing mammograms, largely because of the high costs involved, said Jon B. Schandler, president and chief executive of the hospital. But Mr. Schandler said the hospital also wanted to ensure that such services as mammography screening, bone densitometry and some biopsy procedures are convenient and accessible for women living elsewhere in the county.
Downtown presents problems for patients trying to find parking spaces, and, further, many medical office buildings near the hospital have become "old and tired," Mr. Walsh said. "By that I mean many are not wired to handle the state-of-the-art medical equipment that doctors require today and the larger practices we're seeing. Moreover, some floors in older buildings cannot carry the heavy load of the new equipment."
New construction of interior spaces for doctors' offices and laboratories runs $40 to $50 a square foot compared to $25 for standard offices, Mr. Walsh said. Medical offices require more plumbing for bathrooms and sinks and more electrical outlets that can handle high voltages, Mr. Weisz said. Annual asking rents for office space in Harrison Court are $32 a square foot, compared with $28 a square foot for standard office buildings.
Clearly, the medical market today has placed new demands on office buildings. "First of all, the hours are much more demanding," Mr. Weisz said, "with most physicians starting early in the morning and working late at night, in most cases six days a week and occasionally seven, requiring access, lighting, HVAC and security to accommodate them. Medical practices today need buildings that are open and working at all hours."

Venture-Capital Spending Falls 9 Percent in Region
Venture-capital spending in the New York area fell 9 percent during the third quarter, and only one Long Island company received funding, according to an industry report released Monday.
 CorrectNet, a provider of computer network products in Hauppauge, received $750,000 during the quarter, the report said. During the second quarter, four Long Island companies received over $40 million in venture investments. 
 Bob Sturm, the managing partner in the Melville office of PricewaterhouseCoopers, which helped compile the report, attributed the fall-off to business cycles and the decline in technology spending. "Venture capitalists are concerned that young companies are going to have difficulty gaining traction in terms of customers and revenues," he said.
The Silicon Valley attracted over $1.4 billion in venture capital during the quarter, or 31 percent of the national total, leading the country. The New York area placed fourth, attracting $295 million or 6.6 percent of the national total. 
In addition to PriceWaterhouseCoopers, the National Venture Capital Association and Venture Economics helped compile the figures.

Profit at Weight Watchers
 Weight Watchers International (NYSE: WTW) of Woodbury reported on Tuesday that profits rose to $36.8 million, or 34 cents a share, for the third quarter, up from $15.7 million, or 14 cents a share, during the same quarter last year. Revenues rose 31 percent to $189.2 million, up from $144.1 million in the third quarter of 2001. Weight Watchers now operates in 30 countries.

Income Rises at DCAP
The DCAP Group (OTC: DCAP) of Hewlett, a chain of independent storefront insurance agencies in the Northeast, said Wednesday that profits for the third quarter were about $256,000, up from $40,000 during the same period last year.
Quarterly revenue rose 88 percent to $1.2 million, up from $643,000 for the same quarter last year, the company said. The results reflect the addition of the Barry Scott Companies, acquired in August, as well as substantial growth in DCAP's premium financing operations, said Barry Goldstein, the company's chief executive.

HEADLINE: Why It Costs So Much to Fix a Light Switch 

BYLINE:  By SHELLY FEUER DOMASH 

 BODY:
IF a homeowner on Wellington Road in Garden City hires an electrician to repair a light switch, the electrician is required to go to Village Hall, fill out an application, pay $115 for a permit and an additional $45 for an inspection, and wait for approval.
 Down the street in Garden City South, outside the incorporated village, the forms can be faxed in and the total fee is just $45. 
 That, said Anthony Lennon, the executive secretary of the Nassau Electric League, is why if all the bureaucratic hurdles are jumped, the same small job will cost about $450 in Garden City and about $125 in Garden City South.
If a homeowner wants to convert a boiler and water heater to gas and lives in the Town of Oyster Bay, it would cost a licensed plumber $160 for the permit. In North Hempstead the same permit costs $325. 
Seeking to reduce costs that they say must be passed on to consumers, members of the electric league and the Plumbing, Heating and Cooling Contractors, industry organizations for licensed electricians and plumbers in Nassau County, are calling for countywide licenses and uniformity in fees for permits for individual jobs. Hunter Botto, the president of the plumbers' group, said that plumbers in the county have to pay $3,000 to $4,000 a year just to comply with the license requirements in the county.
"We have to get licenses in the three towns and within those jurisdictions there are numerous villages and cities that all require their own licenses," he said. "Every incorporated village has its own requirements as far as licensing and permits fees."
Mr. Botto said that since a uniform plumbing code goes into effect in New York State on Jan. 1, his organization could see no reason for multiple licenses.
It costs $175 for a two-year plumber's license in the Town of North Hempstead. The same license in the Town of Oyster Bay costs $300 for three years, and the Town of Hempstead charges $200 for one year. The Cities of Glen Cove and Long Beach and all of the county's 64 incorporated villages also require their own licenses, and none of them are free.
Once a license is obtained, permits are needed to begin a job. "Some villages have a $50 filing fee; some are as high as $350," Mr. Botto said. "Some do inspections; some let us do inspections. There is no consistency." 
He said the proliferation of fees and paperwork encourages plumbers to skirt the law by working without permits and sometimes without licenses. "If we were to follow the law to the T, I would have one person in my office every day to file the permits that are required," Mr. Botto said. "The only ones that can do that are the larger companies like Sears, KeySpan and Petro."
The electrical association faces similar regulations and fees. The Town of Oyster Bay charges $350, and Hempstead charges $200 for a one-year electrician's license. In North Hempstead it's $250 for two years. In addition, 13 villages have their own electrician's licenses, ranging from $50 to $300. 
Philip Zuardi, the president of the Nassau Electric League, said that some municipalities require separate insurance with the municipality named on it, in addition to the forms and papers that have to be filled out individually for each municipality.
(Suffolk County has less redundancy in licensing. Bruce Dragonette, the county's assistant director of consumer affairs, said an electrician's license was good for the whole county and cost $200 per year. A plumber's license costs $200 a year and covers most of the county except the Towns of Babylon, Islip and Huntington. Lindenhurst is the only village in the county with its own licensing fees, Mr. Dragonette said.)
Experts cite the proliferation of license requirements as an example of the Balkanization of Long Island. "All you have to do is look at your tax bill to see all the different entities," said Paul Tonna, presiding officer of the Suffolk County Legislature. "There's the library, fire, school, town, village, county, state, and that is a problem for those people who don't spend a lot of time with it. We have a lot of redundancies. Nobody is willing to give up their piece of the pie."
"You have to look to Albany for some fundamental change, and there doesn't seem to be the will," Mr. Tonna said. "Each entity has its own power structure, their own kingdom, and they seek to protect it. We have some major problems in regard to any attempt to streamline government."
Richard Himelfarb, a Hofstra University political science professor, said Long Island's byzantine government alienates citizens. "Every state has counties and cities, but here we have entities called incorporated towns, which have their own laws and their own layer of bureaucracy," he said. "There are so many different entities that average citizens aren't sure who represents them, who they pay taxes to and who to call if they have some problems with roads or the police." 
"The insiders benefit from all of this confusion," Dr. Himelfarb said, "because when people like me throw up their arms and say, 'I don't understand all this, and I won't get involved,' who makes the decisions? It's the politician who gets elected with 9,000 votes out of 80,000 residents, and it's the people who contribute money to the campaign. It is not the average person, because the average person is alienated from this mess."
Some of the fees collected from tradesmen may even be illegal. A. Thomas Levin, a partner in the Garden City law firm of Suozzi, Meyer, English & Klein and president-elect of the State Bar Association, said he recently represented landlords in Freeport who argued that the village was charging far more to register rental properties than it was spending on overhead costs. The Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court ruled that "to the extent that fees charged are exacted for revenue purposes or to offset the cost of general governmental functions they are invalid as an unauthorized tax."
"The decision confirmed that a municipality is entitled to set fees for various permits and applications for permits and different kinds of approvals and licenses," he said, "but the fees have to bear a reasonable relationship to the expense the municipality incurs to administer the permit process and enforce the permit requirement. It is not supposed to be a way to generate revenues to the community in order to keep taxes down." 
Representatives of the electricians' and plumbers' groups say the wide range of fees indicate the money is being used for more than administrative purposes.
"It is definitely income for them," Mr. Botto said.
He and Mr. Zuardi said that except for one or two villages, enforcement of permit requirements does not exist in Nassau County.
The lack of enforcement eventually hurts the consumer, they said. "It is basically like traveling down the expressway and knowing there are no police out there," Mr. Botto said. "Obviously a lot of time and money is going into these towns to do enforcement, and our biggest issue is enforcement. There is none. They say there is, but there is none."
William Titterton, an electrician from New Hyde Park, said: "We are the ones following the rules and regulations. We come up with the insurance, the workman's compensation, and they just keep piling on the regulations. All it does is discourage competition. Because of the exorbitant expense of licensing, not all electricians acquire all the licenses for each village, and therefore there are fewer electricians in those areas."
Mr. Botto said the goal of his plumbers' organization was to cut through much of the bureaucracy and "create a common code enforcement agency." 
"Standards should involve the one state code," he said. "We are not trying to absolve ourselves of inspections. That still should be done, and the village has to be paid for that service. But we want one common license, which would alleviate thousands of dollars in fees and at least 80 different insurance requirements."
"It would make an industry that is better policed by having one common license and one common code enforcement," he said.
David Wasserman, the commissioner of buildings, planning and economic development for the Town of North Hempstead, admitted that if a problem is reported, it takes "a couple of days" to send an inspector. 
Allan Landsman, superintendent for the division of building for the Town of Oyster Bay, said he was aware of the problem with enforcement. "Our inspectors need to see someone doing the work, see it with our eyes," Mr. Landsman said. "On occasion we can't get inspectors there quick enough because we don't have the resources."
He argued that the permit system helped licensed tradesmen. "We are probably the biggest advocates for them," he said, "because we won't issue a permit unless a licensed plumber applies for the work."
But, Mr. Landsman added, he thought the trade organizations should be more active in seeing that the license and permit system is honored.
"They have to clean up their own act," he said. "I don't know what they're doing with their trade association fees. I don't see what they're doing to educate the public."
Mr. Botto was having none of that. "I totally disagree," he said. "The municipalities who issue the licenses should be in charge of code enforcement."

County Fees Have Gone Up Steeply in Last Year
PROBLEMS with a proliferation of license requirements and rising costs to obtain them are not limited to Nassau's town and village governments. The county government has imposed steep increases for many permits and licenses in the last year.
Home improvement license fees doubled, from $200 to $400 for two years. The county now charges $400 to review applications for building permits.
Even fishermen found themselves having to pay new fees. With a Parks Department leisure pass, which costs $10, they had been allowed to fish at Nassau Beach early and late during the summer and all day during the winter. Now it will cost them $25 a year.
"They're doing nothing for it," said Richard Johnson, a licensed fishing guide. "There is no additional security, no bathroom, no added benefits."
But the increase that has drawn the loudest protest is the one for a handgun permit renewal, which was raised from $25 to $200 for five years. The same renewal costs $10 in Suffolk County.
A group of Nassau residents are suing the county over the pistol permit increase. In the lawsuit, filed in February, the plaintiffs claim the fee is "an unlawful tax assessed upon valid pistol and revolver license holders."
Charles McQuair, the plaintiffs' lawyer, contended that the County Legislature passed the increase because "it was politically correct." 
"This is not gun control," he added. "People who want to carry arms will carry them. They have a constitutional right to bear arms."
County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi's office declined repeated requests for comment.
Judy Jacobs, the presiding officer of the County Legislature, said she had been made aware of the protests before Mr. Suozzi took office. "It certainly seemed like a valid complaint to me," she said.

HEADLINE: A Vegetarian Spot Where Feminism Is a Main Course 

BYLINE:  By LISA PIERCE 

 BODY:
FOR just over 25 years, customers like Trevor Fanning have been responding to the curious combination of ethnically inspired vegetarian cuisine, comforting informality and unapologetic feminism offered at Bloodroot restaurant in Bridgeport.
 Despite the fact that Mr. Fanning is not a vegetarian and is at least a generation removed from the political upheavals that inspired three Fairfield County feminists to open Bloodroot in 1977, he seemed at home as he rhapsodized about the food on a recent autumn evening. 
 "Everything here is so absolutely delicious," Mr. Fanning said as he slouched against a shabby-chic antique chair in the corner of the restaurant that houses an on-site feminist book store. "I treasure every bite. Toward winter, when it gets colder and the menu gets heartier, I'll come three nights a week." 
Far from feeling intimidated by the radical feminism evidenced by the position papers that line the walls and the books that line the shelves above his head, Mr. Fanning, 25, who teaches at Fairfield College Preparatory School, views Bloodroot's owners, Selma Miriam and Noel Furie, as mentors.
"You don't think of sending a card to a restaurant thanking them for changing your life," he said, adding that a year ago he did just that. "When you come here you're rejuvenated not only by the food but by the people."
Among the patrons, Mr. Fanning has gotten to know are Sheila and Jack Faxon, vegetarians and animal rights activists who drive two hours from Stockbridge, Mass., every Friday night.
"That gives you some idea how attached to this restaurant we are," said Ms. Faxon, who added that the couple have been dining here for 23 years.
"We come not only because the food is fantastic and the ambience is lovely, but because this is like a salon where people of like minds meet."
On this particular night, the Faxons shared their table with friends: Pedro Hecht, a vegan, and his wife, Judy, who have been traveling 40 miles from Roxbury to dine at Bloodroot's about once a week for the last 16 years.
"As a vegan you can usually find something to eat on a menu but here you can have a full meal," Mr. Hecht said.
Indeed, the menu is one of the few things that has evolved over the last 25 years at this stubbornly activist and technologically averse gathering place. 
Fish was dropped from the menu in 1980 and vegan dishes have become increasingly prominent on the blackboard menu above the kitchen here and in the Bloodroot Collective's three cookbooks. There were 52 vegan recipes in the first cookbook (published in 1980), 55 in the second (1984) and 138 or 85 percent of the total in the latest (1993).
Recalling how the restaurant began, Ms. Miriam said, "A whole bunch of women's book stores opened in 1977, and I thought it would be great to have a place where people could sit and chat and eat while they looked at books."
The restaurant and book store was named Bloodroot after a North American wildflower that blooms in April, its intertwined roots symbolic of the cooperative spirit the restaurant represents.
"We called it a collective because that was important to us," Ms. Miriam said. "There was an implication of equality."
To that end, jobs are shared by employees and collective members, although certain specialties have emerged. For example, Ms. Miriam stocks the book store shelves and makes the pleasantly tangy rye bread.
The Bloodroot Collectives membership has shifted several times since 1977. The one constant has been Ms. Miriam.
Ms. Furie joined as an employee a few months after Bloodroot opened and eventually became a collective member. Presently they are the only two members.
Although she was not a vegetarian at the time, Ms. Miriam welcomed the challenge of coming up with a meat-free menu.
The Bridgeport location was chosen so that the restaurant would be accessible to customers from diverse economic and ethnic backgrounds, a goal that would be reflected in the culturally varied menu.
"Instead of doing stir-fried veggies we really went looking for different ethnic origins to find the way poor people have lived with very little or no meat," Ms. Miriam said.
From the beginning the restaurant's menu placed an emphasis on seasonal dishes heavily reliant on locally produced ingredients, including herbs, kale, tomatoes and other items from Ms. Miriam's gardens. 
"There's no sense in doing strawberries in January or fresh tomatoes in salads in winter," Ms. Miriam said.
"They just don't taste like anything. And unless you get them locally, they don't taste like anything the rest of the year either." 
This dedication to using local produce has only intensified as Ms. Miriam and Ms. Furie have become increasingly concerned about the proliferation of industrial farming and hormone and chemical-laden produce.
The most notable manifestation of Bloodroot's dedication to equity may be the absence of a wait staff. Orders are written down on slips of paper, which customers hand to the cooks at a window.
"It really leveled the field in terms of equality between us and the customers and has really made it much more friendly," said Ms. Furie, who has worked as a waitress at other restaurants.
Because Bloodroot is a collective, there is more fluidity in job functions than in a traditional restaurant with its hierarchy of a a chef, other cooks, managers, waitresses and cashiers. At Bloodroot, collective members and employees share all these functions.
Collective members are expected to work full time, take responsibility for the success or failure of the business and make an initial investment of $1,200. When members leave the collective they retrieve their $1,200 but receive no additional equity.
Bloodroot employs about 15 full- and part-time employees.
A wall of portraits of women, visible as customers enter the dining area, is another tangible reflection of feminism. Some of the photographs depict the mothers and grandmothers of customers, employees and collective members.
"I look at those women and I cherish their lives," Ms. Furie said. "We're connected to them in some way."
There have been some changes over the last three decades. Customers rarely visit the book store anymore. "Frankly, the book store wouldn't be here if it weren't for the restaurant," Ms. Miriam said.
And of course, prices have nudged up as the cost of obtaining local produce has increased. The average customer spends $18 on dinner, $10 on Sunday brunch and $9 on lunch, exclusive of wine and beer, Ms. Miriam said.
Recent dinner items included green tomato pie with caramelized onions 
"So rich it was almost desserty," Mr. Fanning said.
Other items on the menu that night included: a three-grain pilaf, a vegan option, served with pureed parsnips and delicious fried kale, sourdough chocolate devastation cake and pumpkin tofu custard with coconut creme, both dairy-free desserts.
The owners' disdain for technology is palpable in the restaurants exposed wood beams, eclectic collection of antique furniture and its absence of digital devices.
There is no microwave, no cash register and no credit cards are accepted.
"There's a poverty in technology," Ms. Furie said. "I can't imagine that people who spend their life in front of a computer screen have real joy because the real joy comes from life and the real life is out there in the garden, in the dye pot, at the loom or stirring the pot."
Bloodroot is situated in the Black Rock section of Bridgeport at 85 Ferris Street; (203) 576-9168. Reservations and credit cards are not accepted.

HEADLINE: 10 Who Love Their Work 

BYLINE:  By CARIN RUBENSTEIN 

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to jobs, Americans are anxious. Fully half are concerned that someone in their household may soon be looking for another employer, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll conducted last month. 
 Measured statistically, Westchester has it good. Unemployment is well below the national rate. About 405,000 people have jobs here, according to the New York State Department of Labor. 
 But how many of these jobs are superlative? Which jobs are the very best in the county? 
A search on land, sea and air turned up five men and five women who hold the best jobs in Westchester. They're all passionate about their work, whether they earn almost nothing or more than $250,000 a year. 

A Chocolate Artist
Who wouldn't love a job that requires tending a 90-pound vat of swirling, molten milk chocolate, not to mention the chance to do taste tests all day long?
Jennifer Cardone, a bright-faced 24-year-old, has just such a job. She is a culinary school graduate and certified pastry chef, and she owns a chocolate store, For the Love of Chocolate, in Armonk. The store, a charming, lilac-painted chocoholic's nirvana, is filled with beautifully wrapped lollipops and graham crackers and Oreos, apricots and cherries, airplanes and swans and top hats, all either made of, filled or draped with chocolate. 
The best part of Ms. Cardone's job, she said, "is actually making the items, because you get to see what you create instantly." She smiles with delight as she paints the feet and feathers of a turkey mold with white chocolate, perfecting the details on one of hundreds of milk chocolate turkeys she will make this Thanksgiving season.
The worst part of her job, Ms. Cardone said, is cranky customers, like the woman who wanted to know exactly which chocolate sail was the jib, or the one who would buy only a gingerbread duplex, not an ordinary house. Fortunately, though, most of her customers are more like one mother, who spends a dollar every day to buy her toddler son a dark chocolate-covered marshmallow.
Ms. Cardone usually works from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. six days a week. During the holiday season, she may work until midnight, finishing dozens of Christmas gift baskets. Her apprentice, Jane, is also her mother, and Ms. Cardone has a raft of loyal relatives willing to help out when necessary, including her father, brother and a handful of aunts and uncles. Last year, Ms. Cardone earned about $40,000, after expenses, according to her mother, who is also her accountant.
At For the Love of Chocolate, Ms. Cardone will cover just about anything in chocolate: Pringles, popcorn, four kinds of pretzels, even Champagne bottles. 
She eats what she makes, too, an essential quality-control measure. "Unfortunately for my pants, I eat chocolate every single day," she said, laughing.
That is why Ms. Cardone has a second job. She teaches a 45-minute spinning class in the Bronx, four or five times a week. "I call it maintenance, or guilt-free chocolate eating," she said. "I never gain any weight and I never lose any." 

The County's Farmer
He is the only person officially employed by Westchester County to be a farmer.
Joe Plummer, 52, oversees about 70 animals, horses, cows, sheep, pigs, goats and 100 head of poultry, including chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys and guinea hens. He also helps to maintain 777 pungent acres at Muscoot Farm in Somers, one of the last working farms in the county.
Mr. Plummer is in charge of two, just-born twin goats he calls Him and Her; of a 65-pound female calf born in mid-October, named Bandit; and of three male piglets born a day later. He also grows and harvests 5,000 bales of hay each year. Last month, Mr. Plummer had to transport about 2,500 pumpkins into the fields, so farm visitors could pretend they were actually harvesting them. 
It's also his job to answer questions from the sheltered suburban public, like why cows have udders. Every so often, he has to explain that a chicken on the ground is not dead, "all she's doing is taking a dust bath to get the bugs off, same as you taking a shower every day."
Mr. Plummer, who was raised on a dairy farm in Vermont, loves caring for animals. Being a county employee, he doesn't have to worry about droughts or floods ruining his crop or disease killing his herd. He is paid about $50,000 a year and has a house on the property, regardless of how much hay he brings in or how much milk the cows give.
Still, the farm is open 362 days a year, and Mr. Plummer has to be outside year-round, both in 95-degree heat and zero-degree cold. Mr. Plummer usually works from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., unless an animal is giving birth or he has to oversee special weekend activities like the late October Boo Walk and the antique tractor show. 
"You can't get bored working on a farm, because there's always something different going on," he said cheerfully.

A Watchman on the River
John Lipscomb, 49, can't leap tall buildings in a single bound, but he does fight the noble fight against polluters of the Hudson River. 
Mr. Lipscomb is the boat captain for Riverkeeper, a Garrison-based environmental organization, and patrols a 200-mile stretch of the Hudson by boat, from the Battery in New York City to Troy, seeking out polluters and reporting them, "like a neighborhood watch for the river," he said. 
His Batmobile is a 36-foot diesel motor launch, a former lobster boat designed for shell fishing in Delaware, which is docked in Nyack. It is noisy and ungraceful, but the practical working boat proudly bears the word "Riverkeeper" in foot-high letters, 12 feet across, so that it is easily identifiable. That way, "people who live along the Hudson and use it for recreation and business are aware that there is a watchdog," said Mr. Lipscomb.
Indeed, Mr. Lipscomb is well equipped to prowl the Hudson shoreline: he has large binoculars, nautical charts, a sonar depth sounder, Global Positioning System chart plotter and radar. He looks for sewage or oil deposits or building materials or milky slicks, "or any pollution that shouldn't be put into the Hudson," Mr. Lipscomb said. He also does habitat mapping and navigational surveys, and he helps conduct studies to see how fast and well the river flushes impurities out of the system.
Mr. Lipscomb has been aboard one boat or another since he graduated from high school, when he joined the crew of a 60-foot sailing vessel for an 18-month, 16,000-mile trip around the world. Now, after two years as the captain for Riverkeeper, he is intimately familiar with every reef, sandbar and oyster bed along his lengthy stretch of the Hudson River.
Mr. Lipscomb motors under the Tappan Zee Bridge, checking to make sure that painting contractors are containing the hazardous paint chips and rust they are sandblasting off the sides of the structure. (They are.) He eases up to a small boat anchored near the pilings that is flying a diver-below flag, and notes the name and number of the boat, to make sure that it is official. (It is.) 
Mr. Lipscomb is supposed to work an eight-hour day, but he often works seven days straight, 14 hours a day. "It's a get-it-done kind of job, driven by my wanting to get things done," he said. 
"I love boats and I love being on the water, and it's wonderful to do what I love for a greater good, to benefit society," he said. Riverkeeper would not allow Mr. Lipscomb to disclose how much he gets paid.
Mr. Lipscomb loves boating, even in bad weather, but he hates having to be patient, to wait for polluters to fix their mistakes. 
"If I see a problem, I like to fix it," he said. "It's hard to see a clear violation of the Clean Water Act and not get angry if it doesn't get fixed right now."

A Rescue Pilot
 He is a guy's guy who gets paid to fly helicopters and to play with grown-up toys. 
Charlie Robinson, 53, said his job as the aviation manager for the Stabilization, Treatment and Transport (STAT) flight team at the Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla was somewhat like the first flying job he had, piloting a medical evacuation helicopter in Vietnam. But this job is better, because nobody is shooting at him, Mr. Robinson said.
He flies a rescue medical helicopter to pick up the injured at the worst accident scenes, and to transport desperately ill patients, and has successfully landed on major highways, on the Tappan Zee Bridge, and in a field at an abandoned strip mine. He flies in rain and snow and sunshine, at dusk and in the dead of night.
"If you need us, we'll come and get you," Mr. Robinson said, explaining the point of his job in starkly simple terms.
Mr. Robinson, who has been flying helicopters since the Army trained him almost 33 years ago, said he loved this job because "we have neater, better toys on the civilian side" than they have in the military. Mr. Robinson's helicopter has a traffic collision avoidance system that allows him to hear other aircraft as far as six miles away. He has storm-scope detection equipment gives a visual display of nearby lightning strikes. And soon, STAT pilots will be using the latest night vision goggles, Mr. Robinson said with pride. When Mr. Robinson isn't flying, he is tinkering with the office computers, which he also helps to program and maintain.
Mr. Robinson works from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., four days in a row, rests for a day, then works from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. for another three days. Then he gets seven days off. (STAT has eight pilots in all.) For this, Mr. Robinson makes between $75,000 and $100,000 a year, which means that he is not among "the better compensated pilots," he said.
Still, he says, this is the best job he has had. (He has also flown helicopters to drop water on forest fires and to land at a heliport on West 30th Street in Manhattan).
"Flying puts a smile on my face and I still love doing it," he said. "I'm doing something positive, and I'm helping somebody who needs it."

A Maker of Wine
Combine the goatee, the white tufts of hair and the wild eyebrows with the gentle whisper and the habit of fussing with his pipe, and Dr. George Naumberg could be taken for the psychiatrist he used to be. But the purple stains on his fingers give him away: At 84, he is in a second career as the owner of North Salem Winery, the only working vineyard in Westchester County.
In 1965, while he was a psychoanalyst living in Manhattan, he bought 18 acres of grape vines; his holdings have now grown to 269 acres of idyllic property off Hardscrabble Road in North Salem.
On a chilly day in late October, Mr. Naumberg is overseeing a wine press that holds 3,000 pounds of crushed grape skins, the first of 20 batches that will be pressed for juice. The outdoor work area has a heady, yeasty scent, and the concrete floor is puddled with dark purple grape juice. Today's chore is preparing the juice to be stored in a 2,900-gallon stainless steel tank, where it will ferment for up to a month, before it is moved to other tanks, and then left to chill for six or seven months. In June, he will filter and fill about 15,000 bottles of wine. 
Dr. Naumberg estimates that he works about five hours a day, seven days a week. While his vineyard grosses about $85,000 a year, Dr. Naumberg says he doesn't reap a profit. "If I live long enough, maybe we'll make money," he said.
Dr. Naumberg is not nearly so fond of the selling of wine as he is of the making and drinking of it, he said. He has at least two or three glasses with dinner, every night. Dr. Naumberg's vineyard bottles sweet red table wine, merlot, seyval blanc and a rose called "Doc's Own," with a drawing of his face on the label.
"I know what I want to do, but sometimes I physically can't, and the fun of this is doing it yourself," Dr. Naumberg said, with a hint of regret. So he employs a full-time vineyard manager. But he loves his work, he said, because "you're always learning and it's never the same twice, and that was true of psychiatry too."

For Her, It's All Roses
Clare Levy has a job with a view -- and a scent. 
Ms. Levy, 36, a rosy-cheeked woman who wears her curly, auburn hair in a no-nonsense ponytail, shows up for work in boots and heavy-duty work pants. Her tool of choice, a red-handled pruner, dangles from her waist.
Her No. 1 responsibility: : Tending 400 rose bushes in a special garden at the Rockefeller estate in Pocantico Hills. Her charges include hybrid tea roses, floribundas, tall Queen Elizabeths and exotic Rio Sambas, which begin as yellowy-red blooms and slowly change to a light pink. She has a view of the rolling hills of the estate, all the way across the Hudson River to New Jersey. While she deadheads the roses, she is also checking for black spot. Then she moves on to prune decorative junipers. As she works, the perfume of a few still-blossoming roses wafts across the path, perfuming the air as she clips. All around her are sculptures by Henry Moore, Alexander Calder and Louise Nevelson.
"Taking care of plants is something I enjoy doing, and the best part is being outside all day, surrounded by artwork," Ms. Levy said, who used to own a small nursery and cut-flower business in Washington State. In this job, she said, "I'm freed from paperwork, and I get to make a place aesthetically pleasing.
"I have a sense of independence, but we also work as a team," she said, referring to her six colleagues on the gardening staff. Over the next three years, Ms. Levy would like to restore the garden to its early 1970's color scheme, when it had only white, pink and red rose bushes. 
Ms. Levy works 42 weeks of the year, from 7 a.m. to 3:20 p.m. She says she makes less than $50,000.
Her work is not just to beautify a private estate, she pointed out. Because the property is part of the National Trust and Historic Hudson Valley, her rose garden is open to the public, not merely a rosy oasis for the super-rich.

She Is a Neurosurgeon
It is probably just about the most difficult job anywhere, ever, but Deborah Benzil, 43, adores it. 
She is among the barely 100 female neurosurgeons in the country, and one of just two in Westchester County. It's a job for those with extreme confidence and competence, and Dr. Benzil has both to spare, along with deep compassion, empathy and laser-sharp skill. She practices and teaches at Westchester Medical Center, working from 7 in the morning until nearly 7 at night, five days a week and one weekend a month. For this, she earns more than $250,000 a year. 
Dr. Benzil seems to hover everywhere at once while she is in the operating room. She comforts a shivering patient who is having a lesion in his cerebellum biopsied and decompressed. She prepares the equipment, including the 10-inch needle she will use to pierce the patient's brain, while a revolving cast of nurses and medical technicians move about the room. Finally, Dr. Benzil shaves the patient's head and swabs it with iodine, part of a ritual that allows her to set herself up mentally to perform an operation with "military precision," she said. Then she takes a drill bit and aims it carefully at the one-millimeter-spot she must hit.
The first time Dr. Benzil cut open a patient's skull and looked at a naked brain, "it was the most thrilling thing I'd ever done in my life," she said. 
"Neurosurgery is a passion, it's my first great love," she said. "It's hard for me to imagine working at a job where I'm not helping people."
She has removed a pencil from a patient's eye, and recently operated on an 8-year-old whose skull had been penetrated by an 18-inch cleaver. "The girl spent two and a half days in the hospital and when she went home, she was absolutely fine," Dr. Benzil said, matter-of-factly.
The best part of her job, is "getting to know the patients," she said. 
The worst part of her job is watching helplessly as patients suffer and die of incurable brain tumors.
"In the past 25 years, survival for malignant brain tumors has improved by only 1 percent," Dr. Benzil said. "Everybody dies, but I can have a tremendous impact on how a person views his loved one's death."

An Inventor of Desserts
Normajean Longfield, a corporate Everymom with a blond bob, sensible shoes and a bright blue apron, has a job in which she gets to smoosh Oreos with her bare hands and sprinkle them over a concoction of Cool Whip and orange Jell-O. That is what a senior consumer foods manager in the dessert division for Kraft does: she invents desserts that can be made from the company's products and sometimes gets to help invent new products as well, like X-Treme Jell-O and cheesecake-flavored Jell-O pudding.
In an unassuming brick building in Rye, Mrs. Longfield, 43, spends eight hours a day thinking up new ways to use Jell-O pudding and Cool Whip, Baker's chocolate and Minute Tapioca, Chips Ahoy! and Cameos (made by Nabisco, a subsidiary of Kraft). Her office, with a prominently displayed "Very Berry Barbie" doll, packaged with a box of Very Berry flavored Jell-O, is barely 10 steps away from the constantly fragrant Kraft test kitchens, which are stocked like a teenager's dream house, with nothing but dozens of sugar-packed ingredients for potential high-calorie desserts. Mrs. Longfield said her pay falls in the range between $50,000 to $75,000 a year.
In more than 20 years as a food writer, consultant, stylist, tester and inventor, Mrs. Longfield discovered that Americans prefer to cook without really cooking. So it is her job to invent desserts that people can assemble quickly and easily. The best part of the job, "is the creative part and that it's different every day, and never boring," she said. The worst part of her job "is trying not to eat the whole portion," Mrs. Longfield said, laughing.

There to Hear the First Cry
Ida Vega helps bring babies into the world; by one estimate, she has helped deliver at least 1,485 babies during her 12 years as a labor and delivery nurse at Phelps Memorial Hospital in Sleepy Hollow. 
Ms. Vega, a former hairdresser who went back to school at 35 to become a nurse, loves her work. "No matter how many babies you see born, it's always special," she said. "There's a spiritual connection, too, when you witness a birth.".
Ms. Vega's first language is Spanish, and she is one of nine Spanish-speaking nurses assigned to work at the prenatal clinic at Phelps, where almost all of the patients are from Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru, Colombia or Mexico. (She was born in the United States.)
Ms. Vega is as warm and friendly as the prenatal clinic to which she is assigned once a week. A Spanish-language video about breast feeding plays in the waiting area, and the hallway echoes with the sweetly eerie sound of amplified fetal heartbeats. Ms. Vega charms her patients with iron pills, offers of free breakfast and a compassionate ear.
"They know absolutely nothing when they come here, and most have had their babies at home," she said. "This is their first hospital experience. They have a lot of fear and a lot of anxiety, and I love that I'm able to help them out. The language connects me to them, and they suddenly open up when they hear me speak."
Ms. Vega works a 12-hour shift, either three or four days a week. She gets paid $70,000 to $80,000 a year.
The best part of her job is "starting with a couple in the morning, and by evening we have a baby," she said. "I'm connecting with people at the most primitive level, when they're in pain. Whoever is here, I'm there for them. No matter what social class or culture, pain is a common denominator.".
The only bad part of her job is having to help a woman deliver a stillborn baby. "It takes forever, because there is no live baby pushing back," Ms. Vega said. "But you have to find a way to deal with it, you have to acknowledge what's happened."
Ms. Vega, who plays conga drums in a classic rock group in her spare time, is recovering from breast cancer and a knee replacement. She said that taking care of babies every day "puts you in touch with the miracle and wonder of life -- You think about it because you're touching it, you're in it."

The Ice Cream Man
At 53, Nolan West is a man with patrician good looks, who makes, tastes and sells ice cream for a living, a very good living. His business, Longford's Own-Made Ice Cream in Port Chester, does about $1 million in sales annually.
Entering Mr. West's small factory is like taking a stroll in a vanilla forest, only with cow-themed pottery items. The scent is heavenly, the stainless steel counters are shiny clean, and two employees are quietly and gently mixing and freezing tubs of Tahitian vanilla ice cream, made from special beans grown in Tahiti. 
Longford's ice cream has the highest butterfat content possible: 16 percent. (Anything higher, and "it gets to be like Crisco," explained Mr. West.) The company, named after a county in Ireland, produces 23,000 2-gallon tubs of ice cream a year. That's 2,875,000 single scoop cones, including the newly created, fall flavors of cranberry/apple cobbler, key lime pie and Swiss chocolate cookie. 
Mr. West sells his ice cream in a Longford's store in Rye, and in several other shops, but the bulk of his business is selling to upscale caterers, restaurants and country clubs. His clients include Abigail Kirsch Culinary Productions in Tarrytown, Rao's Restaurant in Manhattan and the Sleepy Hollow Country Club. 
Inventing new flavors is the best part of his job, said Mr. West, who works with his wife, Patricia. "We do a lot of licking and throwing plastic spoons in the garbage," he added. During ice cream high season, from April through September, Mr. West works from 7 a.m. to about 6 p.m. Now that it's almost winter, he works a much shorter, seven-hour day.
That is the only bad part of his job, when ice cream sales slow down so sharply, that it's "like somebody threw a light switch," Mr. West said.

Tough Jobs: Hard Work, Low Pay
What are the worst jobs in Westchester County? Here are two prime candidates:
IN A BOOTH -- At the Tappan Zee Bridge in Tarrytown, toll collectors work one of three eight-hour shifts, around the clock. The starting wage is $11.78 per hour, and after five years reaches $17.06 per hour, which is about $29,000 a year. On a busy day, about 165,000 cars pass through the tolls, according to Terry O'Brien, a spokesman for the New York State Thruway Authority. Collectors take money, make change, give directions, deal with complaints about traffic and occasionally have to answer dim-witted questions like "What was that thing I just went over?" (Answer: the Tappan Zee Bridge.) The job is slowly being made redundant by the popularity of E-ZPass.
BEHIND BARS -- At the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining, guards work one of three eight-hour shifts, around the clock. The starting salary is $28,444 a year and goes up to $34,742 after one year. Guards are responsible for supervising 1,761 maximum-security prisoners and 535 in medium security. They have to conduct searches for contraband, in body cavities, and maintain order in the mess hall, in the yard and on the cell blocks. They have no weapons, but are equipped with a personal alarm system and a walkie-talkie. They can take breaks during their shift, but they aren't allowed to leave prison grounds.

HEADLINE: Leaving a Legacy After a Lifetime In the Bogs 

BYLINE:  By JILL P. CAPUZZO 

DATELINE: CHATSWORTH 

 BODY:
CRANBERRY season has just ended here, and nearly all the scruffy pink bushes have been stripped clean of their jeweled red fruit -- all except the nearly 800 acres of prime bogs owned by James Garfield DeMarco, the nation's third-largest cranberry grower.
 Since last spring, when Mr. DeMarco gave several indications that he would not bring in a harvest this fall, rumors have swirled about the intentions of this 64-year-old millionaire, who also happens to be the local political power broker. He and his brother and sister control about 35 percent of the state's most productive cranberry bogs, and they also own more than 9,400 acres of pristine woodlands in the heart of the sprawling Pine Barrens. 
 Speculation ended when Mr. DeMarco disclosed in an interview last week that he had signed an option with the New Jersey Conservation Foundation to sell or donate nearly all his landholdings to the preservation organization. It is believed to be the largest private conservation acquisition in state history. 
"My family's been involved here for many years," Mr. DeMarco said, "but you reach the point where you have to think about going forward."
One of the largest privately owned tracts of land remaining in New Jersey, the property -- owned by the DeMarco family for more than 60 years -- includes all its cranberry bogs, 300 acres of dormant blueberry fields and a vast stretch of unspoiled land that spans Woodland, Tabernacle and Bass River townships.
Michele Byers, executive director of the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, said her organization would pay Mr. DeMarco's company, A. R. DeMarco Enterprises, $12 million, about half the value of the land as determined by two independent appraisals commissioned by the foundation. Mr. DeMarco said the remainder would be considered a gift, the value of which would have to be reappraised for tax purposes.
Mr. DeMarco's stunning move to turn his land over to a conservation group struck many as particularly ironic since the influential grower has battled efforts to control the Pinelands, has been cited by the state Department of Environmental Protection for wetlands violations and has referred to environmentalists as "leftist, egalitarian fanatics."
To fellow cranberry growers, it was one more example of Mr. DeMarco's elitist attitude toward a business that has made him a millionaire many times over.
Mr. DeMarco is the first to acknowledge that he has made enemies along the way, especially among the state's other cranberry growers, who may have tried to buy his premium cranberry bogs -- if it were not that Mr. DeMarco is suing most of them and does not talk to them anyway.
"The other growers aren't too happy with me," he said with his signature guttural laugh. "They think of the environmentalists as the enemy, and they see me as Benedict Arnold."
By selling his property to the Conservation Foundation, Mr. DeMarco will reap additional profits from land on which he has already collected more than $7 million in development credits. He will also be able to wash his hands of a business that has become a personal and professional battleground in recent years. Perhaps most important, the transaction will give Mr. DeMarco -- who can trace his local roots to the 1700's -- a chance to create a legacy.
"People will learn about my family's contribution to the state and what my family has done here," Mr. DeMarco said, adding that he hoped there would be some kind of formal acknowledgment, perhaps in the naming of the conveyed property.
Far from considering a name for the tract -- which is expected to be transferred by the end of next year -- the Conservation Foundation is trying to figure out how to raise the $12 million to buy it. To that end, Ms. Byers said her nonprofit organization had set up a Heart of the Pine Barrens Fund, seeking support from corporations, other conservation groups and individuals.
Negotiations on the tract began more than a year ago, when Mr. DeMarco called Ms. Byers to discuss the future of the property, which is jointly owned by Mr. DeMarco, his brother, Mark, 71, and sister, Anna Papinchak, 61.
"I love the area. I love the land. I don't believe in cutting trees. My feelings about it are very much the same as Michele's and the other environmentalists," Mr. DeMarco said, adding that he had no heirs and that the children of his brother and sister had expressed no interest in taking over the farm operation.
Former Gov. Jim Florio, who was recently appointed chairman of the Pinelands Commission and has in the past been on the receiving end of Mr. DeMarco's efforts to thwart preservation policies, said the decision made sense given Mr. DeMarco's apparent scaling back of his business.
"I assume it was an economic decision on his part, compatible with his interests," Mr. Florio said. "But if he wants to sell the land and have it preserved, that's commendable."
Though Ms. Byers said it was not unusual for her to get inquiries from farmers interested in exploring preservation options, she said Mr. DeMarco's call "came out of the blue."
"It was very exciting," she said. "The first thing I did was ask my staff to put together a big map to see what we were talking about. We were astounded."
For the 42-year-old organization, the agreement represents a major coup, and it is the latest step in a 30-year effort to preserve one of the state's most environmentally sensitive areas, first recognized in 1978 when Congress established the 1.1-million-acre Pinelands National Reserve.
The DeMarco property is situated amid five state-owned properties. Like a missing puzzle piece, the tract will link Brendan Byrne State Forest, Wharton State Forest, Bass River State Forest, Greenwood Wildlife Management Area and Penn State Forest.
"To be able to consolidate lands in the core of the Pine Barrens, and with the size and scope of this property, opportunities like this just don't come along very often," said Ms. Byers, who first met Mr. DeMarco in the early 1980's when his company bought the T-shirts for the annual cranberry and blueberry races to benefit the Whitesbog Preservation Trust.
For environmentalists, the plan is significant because it provides protection of the water, plant and wildlife resources within the property. According to surveys, the land holds 1,500 acres of reservoirs, 600 acres of Atlantic white cedar -- many of these increasingly scarce trees are more than 100 years old -- and thousands of acres of wetlands and upland forest that provide habitats for bald eagles, white-throated sparrows and the Pine Barrens tree frog. What is more, it serves as the headwaters for 14 tributaries of the west branch of the Wading River that feeds the Great Bay estuary.
"This land has all of the rare characteristics and endangered species of the Pine Barrens," said Carleton Montgomery, executive director of the Pinelands Preservation Alliance.
With his siblings and individually, Mr. DeMarco will continue to hold about 70 acres of property, about 50 of which is developable land in and around Chatsworth. But for the most part, he will be divesting himself of property his father began acquiring in 1940.
Sitting on a concrete loading dock in front of his cranberry packing plant here last week, the robust Mr. DeMarco spoke at length about his decision, disclosing a mix of emotions about leaving a business that has consumed him for the last 38 years.
"Certainly there is some remorse there, because of the wonderful team we had and what we accomplished," Mr. DeMarco said. "But I also take great satisfaction that this will be a nature preserve. That my family and I put all this together. That it will remain as one solid entity, for the protection of the environment and the enjoyment of the public."
He added with a touch of pride, "I'm sure my father would have wanted that."
Although Anthony DeMarco has been dead for almost 40 years, Garfield DeMarco seems to have spent much of his adult life making decisions that would please his father.
Not long after Mr. DeMarco -- who attended Dartmouth College -- graduated from Yale Law School, his father was struck and killed by a drunken driver on New Year's Eve in 1964. At 26, the younger Mr. DeMarco took over the cranberry business and management of the 4,500 acres of land his father had amassed. He also had to care for his mother, Gladys, who suffered from acute arthritis, until her death in 1986.
Over the years, Mr. DeMarco nearly doubled the family's land holdings; at the same time, cranberry production rose to levels of 120,000 to 150,000 barrels a year.
During that time, Mr. DeMarco also assumed his father's mantel as a political power broker, moving his base of influence from the family's homestead in Hammonton, in Atlantic County, to Burlington County, where he rose to Republican Party chairman in 1974. For 16 years -- from 1974 to 1990 -- he ran the county's Republican machine and since 1986 has been chairman of the Burlington County Bridge Commission, wielding his power and wealth to ensure Republican dominance of the county freeholder board.
Because of his grip, he has also been accused of exerting his influence in Trenton to extract rulings favorable to his Pinelands property.
"He held a tremendous amount of sway" in the administration of Gov. Christie Whitman, said Jeffrey Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club. "She wouldn't have won the Republican primary if it weren't for the Burlington County G.O.P."
For his part, Mr. Tittel battled Mr. DeMarco on several occasions, most recently in encouraging the Department of Environmental Protection to re-examine the settlement of a 1998 complaint. During Governor Whitman's tenure, the agency -- headed by Robert Shinn, a political and business associate of Mr. DeMarco -- proposed that the grower give the state 74 acres of land and relinquish the sale of development rights on 591 more acres of forest in lieu of a $594,000 penalty imposed against him for filling in 22 acres of wetlands.
Last year, during the short-lived administration of acting Gov. Donald DiFrancesco, another Republican, the environmental agency reinstated the fine after a report found that the proposal violated the Freshwater Wetlands Act. At the same, the agency sugar-coated the bitter pill by allowing Mr. DeMarco to expand his cranberry operation. When the current Democratic administration came into power, however, it decided not only to seek payment of the fine but also to demand that Mr. DeMarco restore the destroyed wetlands.
If Mr. DeMarco has frequently found himself at odds with the state's environmentalists, he has become the archenemy of most fellow cranberry growers.
Mr. DeMarco, a former Fulbright scholar who drives a gold Mercedes and spends much of his time at his family's Victorian-style mansion in Hammonton, does not often see eye-to-eye with the other farmers. Since filing a lawsuit last year against the Ocean Spray Cranberry cooperative, of which he and most of the other local growers are members, Mr. DeMarco has been accused of harming the state's cranberry business.
Mr. DeMarco dismisses such contentions, saying that the industry has been in decline for years because of competition from abroad as well as from an antiquated cooperative structure, leading him to file a suit against the cooperative's chief executive and 11 board members.
Mr. DeMarco's lawyer, Robert Fiebach, said the suit sought more accurate information concerning the finances of Ocean Spray -- owned by the 804 cranberry growers and 126 grapefruit growers nationwide -- so that the shareholders could make an informed decision if they wished to have the cooperative explore the options of sale or merger.
Last month Ocean Spray filed a motion with Delaware's Court of Chancery to dismiss the case, but Mr. Fiebach said that so far there had been no decision. Last week, Northland Cranberries Inc., a competitor of Ocean Spray, filed an antitrust suit against the cranberry giant, accusing the cooperative of monopolistic practices.
The problem is this: business has been dwindling, and New Jersey -- which, with 22 growers, is the third-largest member state after Wisconsin and Massachusetts -- is feeling the pain. Competition from Canada and an oversupply in general has driven down the average price per barrel of berries grown in this country to a low of $17 in 2000 from a high of $66 in 1996, according to agricultural surveys.
To offset the glut, the Agriculture Department imposed limits on production for two years. As a result, the annual value of the New Jersey cranberry growers' crop has plummeted to less than $8 million from $32.9 million over the last five years.
To keep farmers in business, Ocean Spray has been exploring new markets, including the introduction of white cranberry juice in 2000. Chris Phillips, a spokesman for Ocean Spray, called the drink the most successful new juice product in 10 years. Ocean Spray also reported that its earnings increased to $158 million in fiscal 2002, up from $59 million in 2000. Despite the improving financial picture, however, the chief executive, Robert Hawthorne, recently resigned.
Although reluctant to talk about his case, Mr. DeMarco said the conveyance of his land to the Conservation Foundation would not affect his suit against Ocean Spray, and he speculated that Mr. Hawthorne's resignation could only support his position that the cooperative was in trouble.
"If there were all these improvements, then why did they force Hawthorne out?" he asked.
Mr. DeMarco calls the prospects for the cranberry business bleak. "The future is not in New Jersey or Massachusetts, or anywhere on the East Coast," he said. "Wisconsin is ascending, and Canada is on the horizon, and eventually Eastern Europe."
But other local farmers are more optimistic. They see the tide turning and resent the fact that not only has one of their own sued them, but also that he might be taking his prime bogs off the market for good.
Joe Darlington, one of the state's three largest cranberry growers, said Mr. DeMarco never came to meetings of the cooperative and had not spoken to anyone about his plans, let alone give any of the other farmers a chance to buy his valuable bogs. In any event, most growers think Mr. DeMarco -- who was removed from the Ocean Spray co-op board in 1998 -- would refuse to sell them his bogs out of spite.
For his part, Mr. DeMarco said that no one had ever approached him about buying the bogs. "I would have listened to what they had to say if they had come in with anything of substance," he said. "But I've had no overtures, no official contacts."
The likelihood of such contacts even occurring seems remote.
"There have been cases where growers have encountered him in the grocery store and he walks away," said Mr. Darlington, a fifth-generation farmer whose bogs are in Whitesbog. "It really annoys us. When the company should be working on our market problems we also have to deal with this expensive lawsuit."
Given the state of the business, Mr. Darlington acknowledged that it would be hard for any one farmer to buy all of the DeMarco cranberry operation, though a consortium of farms adjacent to the DeMarco property might have come up with a way to make a deal.
Though one might argue that having a major cranberry grower go out of business might help alleviate the glut, the attitude of the New Jersey growers is that they would rather see the farm survive.
"It isn't a big community," Mr. Darlington said. "There are only 35 cranberry growers in total in New Jersey, so it's a shame if we lose someone among us."
In practical terms, dividing up the property was unlikely anyway. "It would have been very problematic to separate the bogs of the middle, since the bogs are so dependent on the water supply," Ms. Byers of the Conservation Foundation said. "That would have put us in a position of managing the water for someone else."
This is not the first time A. R. DeMarco Enterprises stands to make money off this land. Over the years, Mr. DeMarco has agreed to restrict the deed to nearly all of the land in question by selling $7.2 million in development rights to the state and private developers. In a program created by the Pinelands commission to compensate landowners of zoning-restricted Pinelands property, Mr. DeMarco has been the primary beneficiary.
Responding to criticism that he had monopolized the program's funds, Mr. DeMarco said that he encouraged fellow farmers to apply for the credits but that they chose a different compensation program.
With most of the land not suitable for development, selling it to a conservancy makes sense. Mr. DeMarco could also have done business with neighboring cranberry growers, or he could have sold the land to loggers interested in the white cedar and pitch pine. Neither option appealed to him.
"Other farmers will cut down the cedar, which helps keep the water table up, or cut hundreds of acres of pitch pine, causing total destruction," he said. "I don't want to do that. I want it to remain natural."
As for the future, Mr. DeMarco said he would not decide whether to grow cranberries next year -- probably his last -- until next spring "based on how sales are going and what I hear about the prices."
In addition to pulling out of the cranberry business, Mr. DeMarco said he had also scaled back his political involvement, focusing on county issues and only on an "as needed" basis.
"If people want to search me out and ask my opinion, my advice, fine," he said. "But other people are in leadership now. I had my day, now it's time for others."

In Queens, the Chronicle Of a Memoir Foretold

BYLINE:  By ADRIANA LOPEZ

 BODY:
"Gabo, Gabo, Gabo, that's all you hear around here these days," said Viviana Luna, an Argentine book vendor who sets up shop at Roosevelt Avenue and 80th Street in Jackson Heights, the heart of Little Colombia. "It's like he were a brother or friend of theirs."
 With his curly white hair and bushy dark eyebrows, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, affectionately known as Gabo, is perhaps the world's most popular living Latin American writer. The 75-year-old Colombian, a Nobel laureate, whose masterpiece was the 1967 novel "One Hundred Years of Solitude," has been fighting lymphatic cancer since 1999. Now, after 13 years of expectation, the first volume of his three-part autobiography, "Vivir Para Contarla" ("To Live to Tell It") has finally appeared. 
 Not surprisingly, its publication has set off a frenzy in this neighborhood, where imported and sometimes pirated copies -- many sold at inflated prices in underground market fashion -- have been more popular than anything since "Yo Soy Betty la Fea" ("I'm Betty the Ugly"), last year's top-rated Colombian telenovela about a homely woman who becomes the heroine of her workplace.
For transplanted Colombians in this predominantly working-class community, the book has been both a unifying force and a nostalgic link to their homeland, all the more so because the trilogy is likely to be the author's last great work. As Ruben Ramirez, owner of a Colombian family-owned bookstore called Getrex, put it, "His readers search for another encounter with him to get a little closer to their own humanity." 
Early last month, the 579-page work was published in Spain and Latin America, setting sales records throughout the Spanish-speaking world. Knopf, which had won a bidding war for both English and Spanish rights in the United States, responded by moving up the release of its Spanish-language version to Nov. 27, scrapping an earlier plan to release both Spanish and English versions next fall. 
But for weeks, propelled by the buzz in the Latin American news media, Latino readers have been flocking to Little Colombia, where copies have found their way to street vendors and independently owned Latino bookstores.
On Roosevelt Avenue, under the shadow of the elevated No. 7 train, street vendors like Ms. Luna do a brisk business hawking copies of the memoir, which they get from her buyers in South America and Spain, for up to $40 apiece. Around the corner on 37th Avenue, at the more genteel Getrex, Mr. Ramirez has been getting 20 books at a time from his Argentinian and Colombian suppliers. He has sold about 130 copies at $30 apiece and has nearly 200 names on the waiting list.
Some customers shy away from the street vendors in response to a Colombian news media campaign urging readers not to buy illegal copies of the book. Some pirated copies are said to be circulating clandestinely. But the majority of Little Colombia's street booksellers appear to be selling the real thing, a quality-bound edition whose cover bears a haunting sepia image of the author as a child.
Mr. Ramirez's wife, Irma, recalls the day she realized how much the book was touching a nerve among her fellow Colombians.
"I saw a young man sitting in Flushing Meadows Park reading a copy," she said. "And The tears were just running down his face." ADRIANA LOPEZ

Doing Good Can Mean Big Headaches

BYLINE:  By WELD ROYAL 

 BODY:
WHEN Jerry Goldman, a senior tax partner in Ernst & Young's New York office, signed up as a trustee for the Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance in 1998, he anticipated nothing but cultural enrichment.
 He and his wife had recently moved back to Manhattan after raising their kids in the suburbs, and he figured serving on the board would reconnect him with the city's cultural scene, teach him more about modern dance theory and enable him to give something back to society. 
 What he didn't realize is that it would also give him a giant headache. "I had no comprehension of the magnitude of the financial crisis, nor did I appreciate the legal battle the company would face," Mr. Goldman, 52, said. 
The books were a mess. And in short order, the artistic director sued the center, which manages the Martha Graham Dance Company and the Martha Graham School, claiming he owned the troupe's 181 dances. To fight the legal battle and to pay off debts, Mr. Goldman and the eight other volunteer board members ponied up $750,000 of their own money and raised $1 million from other sources. They also sold the center's only asset, its Manhattan headquarters, pulled dancers out of scheduled performances and announced they would suspend operations until the financial problems were solved. The 20 hours a year Mr. Goldman estimated he would spend volunteering for the group turned into almost 100.
At some time in their career, most successful executives will be asked to pitch in at a church, a school, a cultural organization or another one of the nation's more than 819,000 nonprofit organizations.
Serving on these boards can bolster their careers by putting them in touch with well-connected individuals and giving their companies a good name. It also lets them use their management expertise for the good of society.
That much the executives expect. What many don't anticipate, however, is how frustrating the work can be. No longer are they operating in a hierarchy, where the boss's wish is the subordinates' command. On the contrary, their fellow volunteers don't have paychecks to motivate them, and thus can be slow in carrying out their assignments and solving problems. They can also talk back. Moreover, money is almost always tight, leaving little room for financial maneuvering.
And, therein lays a paradoxical risk. Corporate executives are driven by the imperative of delivering value to shareholders, and they thrive by fixing, selling or shutting down financially troubled operations. But if they try to administer the same medicine to troubled nonprofits, they could do more harm than good. "Executives have a real focus on cash flow and bottom-line management," said F. Warren McFarlan, a Harvard Business School professor who teaches courses in nonprofit management and governance. "They may miss completely the organization's mission."
Mr. McFarlan, who has served on more than 10 nonprofit boards, including those of the Windsor School in Boston and the Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass., recalls sitting on the board of a school that was running a cash deficit. "The C.E.O. who was chairman of the board announced he would cancel all advanced-placement courses and double class sizes," he said. An outcry by parents and other trustees blocked the moves, but the incident illustrates the dangers of mixing business practice with altruistic purpose, Mr. McFarlan says.
SOME organizations have set up training seminars to help match executives with nonprofits. BoardSource, in Washington, has held workshops covering everything from legal liability to the basics of fundraising to differences between businesses and charities.
A little bit of individual research can also help. Before he joined his first board last year, Gerry DeRoche, director of consumer systems and support at FleetBoston Financial, wrote down his strengths and weaknesses. He identified three interests -- education, children and sports -- that made him an ideal candidate for the board of Nativity Preparatory School, a Jesuit middle school for boys from poor families living in Boston. Mr. DeRoche signed on and soon had organized a network in Boston for helping alumni who were recent college graduates find jobs. He quickly found himself "owning the whole program," he said.
Charities need more than just ideas and energy from executives. They need money. "We make it clear that 100 percent of board members must give philanthropically," whether $50 or $500,000, said Alice Korngold, chief executive of Business Volunteers Unlimited, a Cleveland organization that links executives with nonprofits. An extra bonus is that foundations that farm out grants look favorably on organizations whose board members give.
They also need bodies. A recent study by the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton and the Volunteer Consulting Group of New York found that one million to three million board seats become vacant annually, a number so huge that filling them is a constant struggle. To address that dearth, in January, the Volunteer Consulting Group started boardnetUSA, a Web-based service that pairs individuals with groups that want new trustees.
Sometimes, executives face unaccustomed tasks at nonprofits. At first, Sandy Stark, former vice chairman of small-business services for Cleveland's KeyCorp, hated asking people for donations to the Urban Community School for poor children. "I felt like I did in my first sales job, pushing products," she said. But she warmed to it, and two and a half years into the $16 million campaign, she has helped raise $6 million.
At the Martha Graham Center, dance is again the primary focus. More than two years since the board suspended operations and after winning two lawsuits that gave the center rights to use all but one of the disputed dances, the organization is building new studios. It recently announced that it would kick off next year's season in January with two weeks of performances in Manhattan at the Joyce Theater.
So, does Mr. Goldman understand more of the theory behind modern dance? Not really, he admits, but he has joined two more boards.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 24, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on the Executive Life page last Sunday about the challenges facing executives who help nonprofit organizations misstated the time it took one such institution, the Urban Community School in Cleveland, to raise the first $6 million in its current $16 million campaign. It was seven months, not two and a half years.

Move Over, Mannequin. Here's Laser

BYLINE:  By LISA SUHAY 

DATELINE: LAWRENCEVILLE 

 BODY:
WHAT is a great-fitting pair of wool pants worth?
 The new technology says it's worth standing in your underwear in a dark booth as lasers whisper, unfelt, over every inch of your body. Afterward, your most intimate measurements are sent off a computer. For all that, you fork over $99. Then, after a few weeks, with a perfect sewing pattern in hand, you whip out those wonderful pants. 
 Some see this as a way to revitalize the home sewing industry, which has deteriorated over the last two decades.
Others see it as something of a ripoff.
Time and a measure of vanity will probably tell whether it succeeds.
"The price is high," said Jane Cappo, 60, of Mount Laurel. But "the concept I love. I'm pear-shaped and very hard to fit. That means spending all my time altering things. This could be a miracle." 
A version of the potential miracle is headed for New Jersey. It is called Bodyskanner, and it will be at Stony Brook Sew and Vac in Mercer Mall, Lawrenceville, Dec. 4 to 7. 
But Ms. Cappo, president of the Princeton Chapter of the American Sewing Guild (ASG), recently traveled to Southampton, Pa., to try it out. "I knew it was coming to New Jersey," she said, "but my friends and I just couldn't wait until December."
Her wider circle of friends is at least a small legion. Her ASG chapter, with 250 members, is the largest of four Jersey chapters. ASG, a 20-year-old organization based in Houston, claims 18,000 members and more than 100 chapters, according to its Web site, www.asg.org. And a recent survey by the Home Sewing Association counts 31 million Americans who still sew at home.
If even a small percentage of those sewers gave Bodyskanner a try, Tanya Shaw Weeks might rattle her high-tech bobbin in celebration. Ms. Weeks, 31, founder and chief executive of Softwear Design Group Ltd. of Nova Scota, conceived of the Bodyskanner idea for her company.
"Home sewing is going high tech," Ms. Weeks said. "It's not about economy. It's about self-expression."
Her concept of this self-expression starts when the person to be scanned disrobes to her foundation garments in a dressing room attached to a small octagonal booth. Once in the booth, the client places her feet on Arthur Murray-style footprints and holds on to two handrails for stability as 12 lasers (similar to those in a laser pointer) sweep over the body for about 45 seconds. The equipment has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for low-emission lasers, Ms. Weeks said. 
Bodyskanner is one of several such machines in the world that use laser and computer technology to scan and map a person's measurements (accurate to within 1/16th of an inch) and use a plotter to create precise garment patterns.
To those who sew at home, scan technology means eliminating arduous hours spent adjusting the fit of standard size patterns.
Elizabeth Anderson, owner of Sew and Vac, clarified the problem with standard pattern sizing.
"Sure, size 12 is the most common size in the U.S.," she said, "but I can line up 10 women who are all size 12 and all will have totally different body shapes. The alterations and fittings are what take up all your time sewing and what makes it so tedious." 
Indeed, that may help explain why the number of home sewers in the United States has dropped by 20 million, or 40 percent, since 1984. The type of sewing has also changed. Now, home sewing is mainly made up of quilters and crafters instead of clothing makers, Ms. Cappo said.
The new technology is trying not only to combat the falloff in the home sewing market but also to create a more accurate sizing system for retail clothing. The TriForm BodyScanner, for example, is being adapted for such uses in Germany, according to Heute Magazin.
In a phone interview from her office in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Ms. Weeks said she was in talks with several manufacturers that are considering using Bodyskanner for alterations in retail sizing. She envisions scan kiosks in stores all over North America that could generate patterns on the spot.
"You can now make a really gorgeous pair of wool trousers with quality of fit and fabric," Ms. Weeks said. "That is what women in North America want and can't find in a retail environment." 
For now, though, the Bodyskanner application is home sewing only.
The $99 price includes the initial scan, membership in the pattern club, a how-to video and a choice of one pattern. Additional patterns cost $19.99 each from a selection of about 1,200, with designs ranging from the sublime to the 1970's ridiculous, trendy low riders to hausfrau frocks.
Traditional garment patterns bought at chain stores, from companies such as Simplicity, Easy Sew and McCall's, average about $1.50 to $3.50 each. More complex patterns from Vogue average $10.
Ms. Weeks says most people don't sew their own clothing to cut costs, but as a hobby that is a means of personal expression, much like those who build their own classic cars or model railroads.
Ms. Cappo agreed.
"Sewing your own clothes is very expensive," she said. "That's what people don't understand. You don't do this to save. You do it as a creative outlet." 
Many people become disenchanted with making clothing because of the problems with fit and high prices for fabric, she added. "If you are going to spend all that money on fabric, your feeling is that it better fit right when you're done," she said. 
At Wal-Mart in Moorestown on a recent Saturday, plenty of shoppers were milling about the home sewing department, fingering bolts of goods and loading their carts. But their goal seemed to be pillows, not pinafores.
"I sewed my own clothes for years and years," said Edie Allen, 77, of Southhampton, in Burlington County. "I started making my dolls clothes. But now I'm just sick of it all. Too much aggravation. I buy my clothes now and when I do, I buy 'em on sale."
Clara Clark, 82, of Mount Laurel, gave the idea a squint and a shake of the head as she fingered the faux denim goods that would soon be a quilt. "That's a good idea they've got there, but sewing my own clothes is just too much trouble anymore," she said. "Most of the ladies I know who still sew are likely to stick with their quilting and leave that pricey stuff alone." 
A check of New Jersey fabric shops and several major chains yielded the following average costs for making a gorgeous pair of wool trousers (size 12): 1 yard of good wool fabric, $30; zipper, $2.98; 1 yard of binding, $1.25; 2 spools thread, $3; lining, $5; sewing machine, $99 for a very basic model to $8,000 for an advanced models; time spent cutting and sewing, 3 to 12 hours; over-the-counter Vogue pattern, $10, or bodyskanner pattern, initially $99.
The look on people's faces when you tell them what it took to achieve those pants? Priceless.

HEADLINE: PRELUDES; 
The Gifts ThatKeep On Giving

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN; Abby Ellin is a Manhattan writer. Her column on starting out in the world of money appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: preludes@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
I AM a terrible gift giver. It's not that I'm cheap -- on the contrary, I probably spend way too much when I actually go out and buy a present. But that's usually to compensate for my re-gifting habit.
 You might know the term; the TV show "Seinfeld" popularized it a few years ago. It's the phenomenon when someone gives you a gift you find so awful or useless or unnecessary that you pass it on to someone else. 
 I'll give you an example: My friend Jill moves into a new apartment. I shower her with candles, lotions and a lovely book on decorating.
"I loved the inscription!" she said a few days later.
Inscription?
"Yeah, the one that said, 'Dear Abby, enjoy your new home!' " She laughed.
I didn't even try to talk my way out of it; I was caught smack in the act of a blatant re-gift. Thank goodness she had a sense of humor, and her own re-gifting moment. A few years earlier, she said, her parents re-gifted a box of chocolates -- unaware that two pieces had been swiped from the box by their grandchildren.
Almost everyone I know has experienced a re-gift faux pas, a tale of purpose and good intent that has gone embarrassingly awry. There's the vase that has somehow made its way back into the hands of the original person who bought it. The gift certificate made out in someone else's name. The shirt that mysteriously fits the giver, but not the beneficiary.
"You have to be really careful in re-gifting that it doesn't come back to bite you," said Dini von Mueffling, co-author of "The Art and Power of Being a Lady" (Atlantic Monthly Press, 2001). "I have a policy of holding onto a gift for a year before I recycle it, even if I know I'm never going to use it, or giving it to someone I know will never come across the person who gave it to me in the first place."
Re-gifting is such a touchy issue that sometimes people are presumed guilty, even if they're not. Hilary Black, 31, the entertainment and books editor at More Magazine has an office in Manhattan stacked with new book releases. In fact, the place looks a little like a library. As it happens, she genuinely likes giving books as gifts. But she said, "I can't do it anymore, because people think I'm being cheap and giving them something I got for free even when I've actually bought it."
It's a tough situation -- and an unfair one. Yet even if Ms. Black does give away something she received free, so what? After all, the economy is not exactly booming, so why shouldn't young people who receive perks in their jobs share the wealth, and save some money, too? 
Why? Because although the thought should count, we all know that what's inside the robin's-egg-blue box holds infinitely more cachet. Ours is a culture of price tags, and sometimes they matter more than the offerings themselves.
This is a shame, because re-gifting isn't only about passing on objects other people have bestowed upon you. It can be about giving away pieces of yourself -- even sharing things you have had for some time and no longer need, say, jewelry or artwork. Recipients should feel both grateful and honored.
Sometimes re-gifting is about practicality. My father recently turned 65. My family threw a surprise party for him here in New York and my boyfriend, Peter, came along. Now my father doesn't drink, and he doesn't really need anything, but for a brief moment I considered giving Peter a bottle of Veuve Clicquot I had in my house to hand off to my dad. Seemed like a win-win situation: my father would be pleased that Peter had given him a gift; Peter would be pleased that my father was pleased, and I would get my bottle back, because I knew there was no way my folks would lug it home to Boston. I ultimately decided that was a lame idea.
For many young people, this holiday season could become the Season of Our Gift-Giving Discontent. Indeed, with so many bank accounts horribly overdrawn and so many young professionals jobless or hustling for work, I'm confident that more than the usual amount of re-gifting will take place.
The thought has certainly crossed Maarten Devos's mind. Mr. Devos, 30, who lives in Brooklyn, has been unemployed since he lost his job as a project manager at the USA Network last December. "Now more than ever I'll have to re-gift," he said. 
FORTUNATELY, he recently got married, so he has a closet full of potential castoffs. "If it's something I don't like and am not going to use, that's a re-gift," he said.
Instead of keeping the practice under (gift) wrap and risk offending someone, I say let's embrace it. Let's expose re-gifting for what it is.
This holiday season, I'm going through my closet and picking out trinkets for specific people. Then I'm affixing stickers: "This has been especially re-gifted for (fill in a name)." If nothing else, at least the recipients will know I'm thinking of them.

HEADLINE: URBAN TACTICS; 
The Return of the Parasol-Topped Cocktail

BYLINE:  By HELENE STAPINSKI; Helene Stapinski is the author of "Five-Finger Discount: A Crooked Family History," published last year by Random House.

 BODY:
BRIAN FISHERMAN came from California with his vibes and a dream to play his Polynesian-tinged exotica lounge music in a New York City tiki bar. 
 "I would say tiki, and people would say, 'What's that?" said Mr. Fisherman, scratching his goatee, his eyes wide behind rectangular glasses. "Nobody had ever heard of it. I was sad." 
 Little did he know when he arrived 14 months ago, New York had been a tiki-free zone for nearly a decade. In the late 80's, the Hawaii Kai staged its last hula floor show. Trader Vic's at the Plaza Hotel, a favorite haunt of both Richard Nixon and Salvador Dali, closed in 1993. Its replacement, the Polynesian-themed restaurant Gauguin, lasted just over a year. 
When Mr. Fisherman arrived on the East Coast, the only place in town with a bamboo hut booth and a drink topped by a little paper parasol was the Jade Island restaurant in a strip mall on the Jersey side of Staten Island. 
Things have changed. The tiki gods are finally smiling on New York. As if rising from the mist like mythical Bali Hai, a wave of new tiki bars has suddenly appeared at half a dozen places around the city; three opened in the last year. The mai tai, a rum drink invented by Trader Vic in 1944, is making a comeback, served by waiters in Hawaiian-print shirts, watched over by hand-carved wooden tiki heads. 
Tiki, a West Coast creation, took off after Americans returned home from the South Pacific after World War II with fond memories of grass huts, white sandy beaches and tropical flora.
"It was the flip side of World War II and the horrors of war," said Michael Batterberry, editor and publisher of Food Arts magazine. "Tiki was fantasy land."
Today, the stress brought on by attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the subsequent military action against terrorists, fear of travel and need for emotional escape help explain tiki's return, especially in New York. 
"Traveling to a place like Bali is out of the question for most people nowadays," said Sven Kirsten, the author of "The Book of Tiki" (Taschen, 2000), a coffee table book considered a bible by tiki enthusiasts. "The terrorists have nothing better to do than blow up a surfers' club in a beautiful, peace-loving, open-hearted tropical paradise. So now you go to your neighborhood tiki bar. The great social escape is tiki. You can enter the bar and leave the world outside."
On a recent night at Waikiki Wally's at Second Street and First Avenue in the East Village, paradise lay just beyond the tiki-guarded front door. A cluster of tropical birds, including a cockatoo named Wally, greeted an assortment of guests that this evening included a couple with a baby, a single man ordering a rum-filled zombie and eight young women from Connecticut at a bachelorette party. 
"I've been to tiki places in the Bahamas and in Hawaii," said Lisa Kontomerkos, the bachelorette, lei around her neck, tiara on her head. "But never in New York."
The owner, Hayne Suthon, who also runs the drag-queen supper club Lucky Cheng's, was a little disappointed to hear that New York had other tiki bars. "I didn't want to be part of a trend," she said.
Decor includes a huge mural of a beach scene, silk coconut palm trees, a bar with a thatched roof, South Seas dioramas that look like something out of the Museum of Natural History and a waterfall gurgling with tiny bubbles. Ms. Suthon even had Don Ho sing for opening night in September, and every Monday night, Wally's is host to the Tiny Bubble Band.
Only one thing is missing: the pu pu platter. In place of the traditional torch-lit, rotating wooden tray of shrimp toast and spare ribs, Ms. Suthon offers more sophisticated fare, like ponzu-marinated sesame salmon and Asian pear salad.
The main attraction, though, is Mi Cheng, Ms. Suthon's diminutive partner (and Lucky Cheng's namesake), who struts around in a grass skirt and Hawaiian shirt with a lei on his head. "He created his own persona," Ms. Suthon said. "He looks as if he was spewed out of a volcano." 
Typically, tiki bars reflect their neighborhood. At 22nd Street and Fifth Avenue is Tiki Room, a Silicon Alley minimalist take on tiki created by Nancy Mah, the designer of Lotus bar and restaurant. There's not a palm tree or thatched roof in sight. Instead, flat-screen television monitors show beach images and the bar's Web site to the singles crowd. A burlap menu offers drinks like the Causeway Spray and the Burning Bush, plus pan-Asian fare with touches of coconut and pineapple. There's even a V.I.P. section.
By contrast, Otto's Shrunken Head at 14th Street and Avenue A serves drinks out of skull mugs while a D.J. spins the Clash. Richard Nixon would not have been comfortable here. At the opening last month, a fellow with a Mohawk greeted neo-punks at the door, while the bartender, wearing black eyeliner and a rhinestone dog collar, taught another bartender how to cut a pineapple.
WITH its Playboy pinball machine and faux leopard-print fabrics, Otto's is more tacky than tiki. But there's a bamboo bar, a tiki drink menu scratched on the wall and puffer fish lamps floating overhead. 
Until last year, Steve Pang, Otto's owner, ran a music rehearsal studio on the Lower East Side, but his dream was a bar that was sort of rock club meets tiki. "I didn't want to serve cosmopolitans and martinis," he said. "I was sick of that whole exposed-brick wall, open-space thing."
Since 9/11 and the economic downturn, bar and restaurant owners in New York have been making their surroundings more comforting and amiable. 
"Everything is warming up," Mr. Batterberry said. "Even the pu pu platter has something very atavistic about it. Sitting around and grilling your food in the cave -- there's this sense of community."
Despite the recent spurt of enthusiasm, New York was late in coming to the tiki table. For years, tiki "didn't seem to suit New York's mentality and consciousness," Mr. Kirsten said.
That is why, he believes, he had a hard time finding an American publisher for "The Book of Tiki." Most publishing houses are based in New York, he pointed out, and publishers would say: "Tiki? What is this guy talking about?"
After a decade shopping around "The Book of Tiki," Mr. Kirsten found a German publisher to release it in the United States. The book is in its second printing and is to appear in paperback next spring.
"The beautiful thing about tiki," he said, "is that it functions well in tropical climates, like in Florida and California, but it works just as well in the snow or in a harsh urban climate like New York. In the concrete jungle, you need some relief."
Tiki also stirs powerful, atavistic memories among many New Yorkers. Somewhere deep in the memory banks of many people in their 20's and 30's is a recollection of a coconut- and pineapple-flavored family dinner at a place like the Hawaii Kai.
Mr. Pang, a native New Yorker, remembers walking past the Hawaii Kai when he was a kid. "I remember the midget outside yelling at people to come in," he said with a laugh. 
The tiki renaissance is not limited to Manhattan. Across the East River, the Zombie Hut bar has been attracting Brooklyn's youthful Smith Street crowd ever since it opened in August. The owner, Tod Bullen, and his partner, Renee McClure, have brought in comfortable couches, drinks like the Gilligan and custom-made skateboard cocktail tables. 
By contrast, Otto's, in the East Village, is adolescence distilled, with album covers on the walls and a giant, blue-eyed tiki head that blows smoke from its nostrils. One night the machine went haywire and filled the room with noxious smoke, but no one seemed to mind.
Mr. Fisherman, who was soaking in the tiki vibe at the bar before going on stage, beamed. "All these places opening up at the same time," he said. "It's a dream come true for me, baby."

Leasing Loses Allure For Car Dealers and Buyers

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
NOT too long ago, discounted lease deals on cars and trucks were everywhere. But consumers who were seduced by the no-money-down, low-monthly-payment deals of the mid- to late-1990's are getting a jolt now that their contracts are running out. For many people, it's getting harder to simply drive into dealerships with their old cars and drive away in new ones, with comparable monthly payments.
 The problem isn't so much that prices have risen -- they have gone up slightly -- but that many carmakers have cut back significantly on subsidized leases. Instead, they are pushing zero percent financing and big rebates on cars and trucks that consumers buy outright, rather than lease. 
 "Zero percent financing has become the incentive du jour; our focus has shifted from leasing," said George M. Pipas, chief sales analyst for the Ford Motor Company, echoing the sentiment of many of the other big automakers. 
Not surprisingly, lease volume has softened. Only 23 percent of all vehicles sold this year have been leased, down from 32.2 percent in 1998, according to CNW Marketing Research, a company in Bandon, Ore., that tracks the auto industry. 
The main exception, though, has been in the luxury car and truck market. Leasing remains a popular way for consumers to afford a more expensive vehicle. But even here deals aren't as attractive as they used to be.
In most cases, car shoppers have to search harder for good deals, and sometimes switch models in order to keep payments at a level they want to pay. That is what happened with Joseph G. Farrell, 28, of Macomb, Mich. He wanted to lease another Ford Expedition when the three-year lease on his 1999 Expedition ran out last winter. He was not interested in a zero percent loan, although he probably would have qualified for one.
"Leasing is the best answer if you like driving a new car every year," said Mr. Farrell, a computer engineer who enjoys changing vehicles frequently. "There's no money out of your pocket, you have lower payments and no maintenance because you're essentially driving a new car."
But when he tried to lease a new Expedition, he found that the cheapest payment he could negotiate from his Ford dealer would be $550 a month over three years, based on a $32,000 sticker price. He was paying $432 a month on his old Expedition, which had cost $31,000. 
Mr. Farrell decided instead to lease a 2002 Chevrolet TrailBlazer, a bit smaller than the Expedition, and a little less expensive. He negotiated a lease payment of $405 a month for three years, based on a price of $28,000. He said he did not tell the dealer that he planned to lease the vehicle before he settled on the price -- advice he often passes along to fellow lease shoppers.
Negotiating price is, in fact, the best way to bring down the cost of a lease car. Another area where lease customers might be able to negotiate is in what is known as "the money factor," or the effective interest rate that they will be paying. (Lease rates are roughly tied to new-car loan rates, although they are not published in the same way. Instead, they are expressed as a percentage, which you multiply by 24.)
Sarah Parga, 26, of Los Angeles, researched rates and terms through Edmunds.com, an automotive Internet site, before she signed her lease agreement last spring. She said she ended up paying the equivalent of a 4.9 percent interest rate on the lease for a 2002 Volkswagen Jetta, which had a $23,000 sticker price. She said that was the rate she could have gotten on a loan for a new car.
Ms. Parga, who works for the campus police department at the University of California at Los Angeles, said a car loan was not attractive. To get the same $336 monthly payment that she got on a three-year lease, with $1,400 down, she would have had to put down $6,000 on a six-year loan. "I didn't feel comfortable committing to six years on a car," said Ms. Parga, who leased two Honda Civics before leasing the Jetta. 
It is much harder, however, to negotiate better terms on a vehicle's residual value, which is what an auto company estimates a vehicle will be worth at the end of a lease contract. The higher the residual, the lower the payment.
At the height of the leasing craze during the mid-1990's, auto companies and other lenders deliberately inflated residual values in hopes that the profit that they earned on each transaction would offset any losses later. That drove payments to miniscule levels, as low as $79 a month at one point on small Chevrolet pickup trucks. "The dealers used to say, 'Why do you want to buy a car, when you can lease it cheaper?' " said Ron Pinelli, an analyst with Autodata Inc., an industry statistics company in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
But once the consumers brought their vehicles back to dealerships, lenders were essentially stuck with them, because residual values did not match up with the low prices that the cars and trucks brought as used cars.
Auto finance companies, banks and other financial institutions are expected to lose $10 billion on leases this year, according to CNW Marketing. General Motors told analysts in October that it was losing $100 to $200 on every leased vehicle. Leasing is now down to just 12 percent to 13 percent of its auto sales, half what it was a few years ago. Leasing at Ford is also down by that much, Mr. Pipas said.
It is a different story, however, in the luxury market in which leasing has always been a common tool to attract buyers to higher-priced cars and trucks.
In fact, although leases at Toyota Motor dealers have dropped to about 13 percent of its total business from 23 percent in 2000, leasing still makes up around 35 percent at the Lexus division, said George Borst, president of Toyota Financial, the credit operation for the automaker. And leasing has actually risen this year at the German automaker BMW, which is enjoying record sales and is seeing strong demand for preowned models, keeping its residual values high. Leases comprise about 38 percent of BMW's sales, up from 33 percent last year, said Martha McKinley, a company spokeswoman.
From July through September, BMW offered a three-year lease on its $35,000 Z3 sports car for $378 a month, with $2,500 down. That monthly payment was "substantially less" than any leases BMW had ever offered on the Z3, which was replaced this fall by the Z4, Ms. McKinley said.
Indeed, luxury companies would have a difficult time convincing all but the wealthiest customers to come into showrooms were it not for lease deals. A buyer purchasing a Lexus GS 300 costing $41,594 would have to put down at least $5,000, and pay nearly $850 a month in car payments, based on a new-car loan rate of about 5 percent and a four-year loan. Generally, that same Lexus can be leased for the same period of time for about $500 a month, with a down payment of $2,000. The figures may vary depending on the type of discounts that are available. Like many auto companies, Lexus offers better deals in parts of the country where it most needs to attract business.
WHILE that lease deal is still more affordable than buying outright, that is a much higher payment than luxury car buyers got used to seeing during the last few years, when deals of $399 and $499 a month were regularly advertised for many luxury sedans and sport utility vehicles. 
Such offers still appear from time to time when auto companies need to clear out an excess inventory of certain models. For example, luxury car companies typically offer discounted lease deals at the end of the life cycle of a vehicle as Mercedes did earlier this year on its E-Class sedan, before it introduced a new version this fall.
Often, such discounts will prompt the manufacturers of competing vehicles to offer similar bargains on their vehicles. So it pays for consumers of all types of vehicles, not just luxury ones, to compare ads, read fine print on lease ads, research competing deals on the Internet and keep crunching numbers until they find a bargain that they like.
For even with the losses that some in the industry have encountered, automakers will increase their lease business in response to customer demand -- and especially if they start to lose many lease customers. After all, lease customers have higher incomes and better education levels than typical car buyers, making them better credit risks, according to CNW Marketing. Also, "the most loyal customers are lease customers," Mr. Borst said. "We absolutely would love to expand our lease portfolio."

HEADLINE: Deepening Shadows 

BYLINE:  By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
SOMETHING in the air seems to be changing. Once again, it's not uncommon to feel a vague sense of dread when walking down a shadowy street. Strangers look slightly menacing. The sound of footsteps provokes a sense of unease.
 It's not as bad as it was a decade ago, when crime was every New Yorker's waking nightmare. But New Yorkers are more fearful these days, and that is odd, given the city's dropping crime rate. 
 Police statistics show that crime is the lowest it has been in four decades. For the first time since the early 60's, the annual murder rate is on pace to fall below 600. 
Yet a new New York Times poll, taken late last month, shows that a growing percentage of New Yorkers feel that their city is less safe today than it was four years ago.
The sense of insecurity began growing in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, but it has continued to climb steadily in the last six months, according to the poll.
Asked about how safe the city is now compared with four years ago, nearly a third of New Yorkers -- 30 percent -- said it was less safe, up from 21 percent in June and just 12 percent in August 2001. The numbers suggest a profound and rapid shift in attitudes among New Yorkers. The poll, which sampled 359 adults, has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points. 
"This is an endless topic of conversation among people now," said Fred Siegel, a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington who lives in Flatbush, Brooklyn, and teaches history at Cooper Union. 
"All across the political spectrum, there is just an uneasiness, a sense that something is happening, though people can't put their finger on it," he added. "Thoughtful, intelligent people who have no political ax to grind have a sense that something is going wrong."

The Search for Answers
There are several possible explanations for the disparity between perception and reality. One is that New Yorkers are sensing winds of social change that have not been fully reflected in the crime statistics. It is also possible that in these uncertain times, people are more fearful of crime because of Sept. 11 and the economic downturn.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, who took over after the celebrated crime-fighting years of the Giuliani administration, is one of those who takes the view that Sept. 11 remains a major factor. His challenge is to convince New Yorkers that, despite diminishing resources, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is not soft on crime, and he argues that much of the fear is driven by the public mood after the terrorist attacks. 
"Your fundamental question is why that perception," Mr. Kelly said. "Everything is now related to terrorism." 
Others point out that the farther the city gets from Sept. 11, the more the fear of crime manifests itself.
In interviews after the poll, some New Yorkers did mention the terrorist attacks, but they also grounded their answers in a growing fear of conventional crime. A universal theme was the conviction that former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was much more immersed in fighting crime than Mayor Bloomberg, and that the city's current budget woes will only compound the problems.
Other factors may also be at work. People reported more visible disorder -- more homeless people, more panhandlers, more people urinating in public, dirtier streets and sidewalks. All those signs of disarray make it easier for people to feel less safe, whether or not that feeling is justified. 
Anecdotal and some statistical evidence indicates that while citywide averages, especially for major crimes like murder, are dropping, there are pockets where the crime rate is rising, as are the number of low-level offenses. The perception that the city is unsafe may reflect local reality, as the Bloomberg administration has acknowledged with its recent crackdown on the homeless.
That perception can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
"If you really believe something, then you become fearful and become as entrapped by it as if it were a real crime wave," said Ron Schiffman, director of the Pratt Institute Center for Community and Environmental Development in Brooklyn. "You're not hurt by it unless you imprison yourself, unless you stop going out on the streets. And that might lead eventually to more crime."

The Giuliani Factor
Jackie Solano, a 35-year-old university administrator who lives in Inwood, said she felt less safe now than she did four years ago. For the first time in several years, she said in an interview after the poll was conducted, she has begun to hear teenagers who are out late at night on the corner near her apartment at 211th Street and Broadway. Also, nearby Academy Street, which had been closed to traffic to deter drug dealing, has been reopened. This, she said, has heightened her sense that the neighborhood had backslid.
Like many questioned in the poll, she traced the changes to the new mayoral administration. "I just really think there is a lack of police protection," Ms. Solano said. "When Giuliani was around, he cleaned up a lot of streets."
Although Ms. Solano, who is of Dominican descent, feels comfortable in her predominantly Dominican neighborhood, she recently surprised herself by toying with the idea of leaving the city. She fears a rise in crime, and she worries that her two children, one a kindergartner at a parochial school and the other a 2-year-old, will not have a bright future here. Her husband was laid off from his job in the hotel industry, adding to the family stress.
Another New Yorker who linked his growing apprehension to the change at City Hall was Sherman Jackson, a 55-year-old former government worker and lifelong New Yorker. Mr. Jackson, who lives on the Upper West Side, was mugged for the first time in his life three months ago while crossing West 71st Street.
As he remembered the incident, a drunken man swung a beer bottle at him, then menaced him with what turned out to be a pellet gun. Officers from the 20th Precinct responded, Mr. Jackson said, and told him that they had arrested his assailant a dozen times. Yet not long after, Mr. Jackson spotted the same man sitting on Columbus Avenue, a bottle of beer in each hand.
"In the Giuliani administration, that kind of stuff just didn't happen," Mr. Jackson said. "The cops didn't have any tolerance for public drinking. Perhaps because their attention has been diverted post-9/11 -- I don't know what to ascribe it to -- but you see a lot more of that."
Political and police analysts say the loss of Mr. Giuliani as an anticrime leader may be taking a psychological toll. At times, he seemed to be the de facto police commissioner, while Mr. Bloomberg has a much lower profile in fighting crime.
These perceptions are reflected in the poll results. Almost no one (only 9 percent) thought Mr. Bloomberg was doing a better job than Mr. Giuliani in fighting crime. But 46 percent said Mr. Bloomberg was doing worse than his predecessor, up 13 points from 33 percent in June.
But Edward Skyler, Mr. Bloomberg's press secretary, pointed out that nearly 70 percent of New Yorkers polled said they did not feel less safe. He said the mayor has not been timid about crime.
"I'll tell you what, he talks about it quite a bit," Mr. Skyler said. "But it doesn't make the papers. You know why? Because it's not news."
Ms. Solano of Inwood sees things differently. "Bloomberg is trying to run the city as a businessman," she said. "He's trying to cut the budget and save money. But I don't think he's looking at the overall picture, which is to make sure the city is safe and create jobs."

A Sense of Lawlessness
Even if Mayor Bloomberg is perceived as different from his predecessor when it comes to fighting crime, police officials are still amazed that so many New Yorkers feel less safe than they did, given the stunning reductions in the numbers.
The Compstat statistics -- used to track and fight crime by precinct -- show that most major crime in New York is at a 40-year low and continues to fall.
Murder is at its lowest level since 1963. Police estimate it will peak at about 570 murders this year, down from 621 last year and 2,245 in 1990. Although rape is up, city statistics do not distinguish between acquaintance rape and forcible rape, which F.B.I. statistics show is down 3.3 percent for the first half of this year.
Police Commissioner Kelly said the perception that crime is growing, "flies in the face of logic." He suggested that the constant drumbeat about declining crime from the news media and the Giuliani administration had made it almost a parlor game to wonder whether the new administration could keep it up.
"Call me crazy," Mr. Kelly said. "There's a reach here." He said a television crew trying to film a true-life crime show in the East Village had been forced to go elsewhere because there was so little activity.
As for the impact of terrorism, he said that recent terrorist attacks like the bombing in Bali only deepened fears. New Yorkers say their heightened sense of insecurity comes less from major crimes than from more subtle shifts.
Their feelings may be related to the so-called broken windows theory of policing, pioneered in the early 1980's by James Q. Wilson and George Kelling. According to this theory, public disorder like vandalism and littering breeds bad behavior and even crime. A study in Newark showed that while increased foot patrols did not reduce crime, people felt more secure, tending to believe that crime had been reduced.
"'Clean streets equate in people's minds to lower crime rates," said Mr. Schiffman of Pratt Institute. "Now with all the discussions about budget cuts and reductions in the amount of money going for policing and fire, all these anxieties are beginning to rise. So people's perception of what may happen begins to be blurred with what has been happening and what is the reality."
Mr. Jackson, the former government worker, said he had noticed that panhandlers outside a deli at 84th Street and Columbus Avenue appeared to be steering people to drug dealers working nearby, in exchange for a $10 or $20 bill in their cup. While crime may not have risen, he said, "you feel it's imminent."
"It's a very ominous feeling," he added. "It makes me almost feel as if I want to escape. The other shoe is going to drop soon enough. I am feeling more defensive, I genuinely am."

'It's Been There All Along'
Another theory is that citywide averages mask pockets of increases in borderline neighborhoods, increases that may hint at worse problems to come. The New York Times poll documents a slight bump in the number of people who say that they or members of their immediate family have been the victim of a crime in the city in the last year. The percentage of victims has risen to 14 percent from 10 percent a year ago. Although the increase is just below the limits of statistical significance, it reverses the downward trend that polls have shown in the last five years.
Lenora Howard, 24, a single mother of four in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, said drugs and gangs in her neighborhood had been pushed deeper underground, but she fears they will return at the first sign that the police are lowering their guard. "It's not gone," she said. "It's been here all along, in certain neighborhoods."
When New Yorkers were feeling victorious over crime, Mr. Schiffman added, they may have been more willing to overlook the reality that crime continued to persist in certain neighborhoods. 
An examination of the Compstat statistics shows that while overall crime is down, some categories are inching up in some precincts.
In Mott Haven, in the Bronx, every category of crime except for grand larceny has been dropping. But in one week straddling late October and early November, the number of robberies jumped 33 percent, to 16 from 12; the number of serious assaults jumped 150 percent, to 10 from 4, and the number of grand larcenies rose 67 percent, to 5 from 3.
Emily Resvanis, a 55-year-old homemaker who lives in Jackson Heights, Queens, said her neighborhood of two-family homes had recently experienced a rash of crime.
"I've had quite a few burglaries in my neighborhood, which was one of the best neighborhoods in the city," said Mrs. Resnavis, who has three children, two still living at home. "Something is going on. My son is going off to work, he worries about what's going on on the train. I see an increase of people stealing pocketbooks off women."
She did not blame the police. 
"The police are probably overburdened," she said. But she did say they seemed to be responding less aggressively than in the past. Her neighbor, she said, had to call the police several times after a burglary before they came to take fingerprints. She also said she sees more abandoned cars, apparently stolen, on the streets.
In Jackson Heights, police statistics bear out Mrs. Resvanis's observations. So far this year, crime in the 115th Precinct has risen 1.69 percent, although over the last two years, it has dropped more than 7 percent. People don't notice averages, however; they notice what they see and hear. Within those averages, murder is up 75 percent, to 7 murders from 4; rape is up 26 percent, to 29 from 23; robbery is up 19 percent, to 418 from 352, and burglary is up 8 percent, to 449 from 414.
Mr. Kelly did not dispute the numbers, but said, "If I show you crime is down in 66 out of 76 precincts, is that good or bad?"

Living With Ambiguity
Most New Yorkers, of course, feel the city is as safe as it was four years ago. 
Eberto Pineiro, a 33-year-old methadone counselor, said Park Slope, Brooklyn, where he lives, and the East Village, where he socializes, have become so gentrified he finds it hard to believe they could slide back to what they were in the 1980's. If anything, he said, he sees less desperation among clients at the clinic where he works.
He confessed to some uncertainty about the future. 
"I do have that fear," he said. "But it's not due to anything outside of just the fact that in cities this enormous, things fluctuate. You have periods of crime and periods of less crime."

HEADLINE: J.P. Morgan's Thorny Dilemma on Troubled Loans 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
WEIGHED down by a troubled loan portfolio, a depressed market for its investment banking business and a demand by investors for better results, William B. Harrison Jr., the chief executive of J. P. Morgan Chase, appears to have backed himself into a corner.
 After nearly two years of mostly disappointing results, the bank's stock has slumped almost 40 percent this year alone -- more than three times the drop of its benchmark index. 
 Investors want J. P. Morgan to put the past behind it, rid itself of problem loans and investments and start fresh. It could begin, they say, by selling its worst holdings in the telecommunications industry and taking yet another charge against earnings before the end of the year.
But the bank, which made many of those investments at or near the peak of the market, is resisting selling them at or near the bottom. And it is chary about antagonizing the credit rating agencies, which have already cut the bank's creditworthiness because earlier writeoffs have eaten into its capital. Giving up on more loans could send the bank's debt ratings even lower, raising costs and crimping its trading operations. 
"You can see that they are hamstrung," said Thomas M. Finucane, an analyst with State Street Research.
Mr. Harrison is pleading with investors to be patient, insisting that the bank's corporate lending and investment banking businesses will revive when the economy does.
But, as the person who is responsible for this mess, his credibility is weak. Investors and analysts are not in the mood to cross their fingers and hope for the best. If results do not improve soon, even officials within the bank acknowledge that a management change may be inevitable.
"Management should bite the bullet and cut the dividend and get out of the denial they are in," said Michael L. Mayo, an analyst at Prudential Financial.
He pointed out that the dividend has not changed since just after the merger creating the bank was completed on Dec. 31, 2000, even as earnings have plunged. "The bank is paying out too great a proportion of its earnings in dividends," Mr. Mayo said. Last quarter, it paid its usual dividend of 34 cents a share, even though its operating earnings were less than half that, 16 cents a share. The bank dipped into its capital to make up the difference.
J. P. Morgan executives, including Mr. Harrison, who was traveling and not available to be interviewed for this article, have said they are reluctant to cut the dividend because its relatively high level -- over 6 percent of the share price as of Friday's close -- attracts investors to the stock.
Dina Dublon, the chief financial officer, acknowledged in an interview last week that the bank's position was difficult. "There is no silver bullet" to slay all the bank's demons, she said.
Some professional investors agree, but that is hardly good news for the bank.
Michael F. Price, the legendary value investor who made a fortune for investors in his Mutual Series funds by loading up on Chase Manhattan stock in the mid-1990's, said he was not tempted by J. P. Morgan even at today's prices. Instead, he recently bought shares of Citigroup.
While Citigroup's shares are also down this year -- they are off almost 22 percent -- Mr. Price said he found Citigroup's businesses easier to analyze and value, and its earnings less volatile than J. P. Morgan's.
"I don't look at things when I can't understand them," said Mr. Price, who now manages $500 million in personal and college endowment funds. He said that he would not consider buying the stock until it was trading closer to half its current value. "If there is more uncertainty, I want a lower price," he said.
THAT sums up the dilemma facing Mr. Harrison and his team. Doing nothing means not addressing investors' anxieties. But doing enough, too quickly, to fix its problems -- say selling a large portion of its loan portfolio at a steep discount -- might lead the ratings agencies Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service to lower the bank's credit rating again.
Both S.& P. and Moody's lowered their ratings on the bank's debt in recent weeks. A lower rating, which suggests greater risk, can mean higher borrowing costs for a bank, and other institutions may demand more collateral to trade with the company, also raising costs.
According to investors who met with Ms. Dublon earlier this month, she said that Tanya Azarchs, an S.& P. analyst, told her that the agency did not want to be "surprised."
Ms. Dublon and Ms. Azarchs both declined to comment on the conversation, but Ms. Azarchs has indicated in her written reports that she would like to see steadier, less volatile earnings from the bank. As one example, she noted, J. P. Morgan's trading revenues in the third quarter dropped 67 percent from the previous quarter, far worse results than at other banks.
J. P. Morgan got itself into this fix fairly recently. Mr. Harrison bet big on expanding its presence in investment banking, undertaking a string of deals in 1999 and 2000, just as the stock market was peaking.
As the chief executive of Chase Manhattan, he bought Hambrecht & Quist, an investment bank specializing in technology stocks, for $1.35 billion; the Beacon Group, a merger advisory boutique, for an estimated $450 million; and Robert Fleming Holdings, an investment bank based in London, for $7.7 billion.
In September 2000, Mr. Harrison made his biggest bet of all, initiating the $31 billion merger of Chase with J. P. Morgan.
At the same time, Chase became one of the largest backers of telecommunications companies, financing such ill-fated businesses as Global Crossing and Lucent Technologies. One recent fiasco came in July, when Genuity, an Internet services company, defaulted on a $2 billion bank loan. J. P. Morgan had originally provided $500 million of that loan, although it may have since reduced its holding. Genuity is in negotiations with its lenders and has since repaid $208 million to its banks.
When J. P. Morgan reported its results for the third quarter last month, Mr. Harrison conceded that the bank had made too big a bet on telecommunications. But he insisted that the company's strategy of expanding in investment banking would yet pay off.
"We have made some mistakes," he said in a conference call with analysts on the day the results were announced. Still, he added, "these actions that we are taking do not detract in any way from our commitment to our long-term strategy."
Some investors may have been persuaded, or perhaps the stock's steep drop made it irresistibly cheap. J. P. Morgan's shares closed at $22.09 on Friday, up nearly 45 percent from Oct. 9, when it dropped to $15.26.
If the economy and the markets continue to lag, it could take a long time for J. P. Morgan to recover. The weak economy is forcing the bank to cut back its stock-underwriting business. Building that business was one of the goals of the merger of J. P. Morgan and Chase. It also said it would lay off more than 2,000 investment banking employees.
The retreat has led some analysts to worry that J. P. Morgan will lag behind its competitors once the economy comes back -- and that if the downturn continues the bank's already weak profitability may lead it to look for further savings.
"These cuts could run the risk of eliminating revenue-generating capacity when markets eventually recover," wrote Peter Nerby, an analyst at Moody's, when he lowered the bank's ratings last month.
All this would bode poorly for J. P. Morgan's stock, and a weaker stock could make the bank vulnerable to a takeover and increase pressure on Mr. Harrison and his team to resign.
For weeks, investors have been speculating that the Bank One Corporation in Chicago would look to acquire J. P. Morgan. Bank One's chief executive, James Dimon, is the former president of Citigroup and was a longtime aide to Citigroup's chief executive, Sanford I. Weill, before Mr. Weill forced him out in 1998. Some investors have wondered whether Mr. Dimon, who is still trying to turn around Bank One, has ambitions to run a much larger empire.
"Jamie has said in private that under the right set of circumstances it would be a wonderful deal to do," said one investment banker, adding that no such takeover appears imminent. Representatives of J. P. Morgan and Bank One declined to comment on the possibility of a takeover by or merger of the banks.
For now, Mr. Harrison is battling to win back investors' trust by acknowledging, tacitly, his previous mistakes. At the presentation earlier this month, he used the phrase "but we've been wrong before," Mr. Finucane said. "That's not lost on us," he said of the analysts' community.
The credibility of J. P. Morgan's management has been falling for nearly a year, since the bank acknowledged last December that it was owed $2.6 billion in a deal linked to Enron -- $1.7 billion more than what the bank had previously disclosed. J. P. Morgan announced the higher number only after it filed a lawsuit to recover about $1 billion from a group of insurance companies that had backed some energy trades between the bank and Enron.
Since then, J. P. Morgan has reported results that have lagged those of its competitors. In the most recent quarter, J. P. Morgan's profits tumbled 91 percent from the period a year ago as it wrote down the value of loans to telecommunications and cable companies and took additional reserves against future losses.
J. P. Morgan announced in the third quarter that it would tighten lending limits so that it would not risk as much capital in a single industry or on a single borrower. This year, J. P. Morgan has cut its telecommunications loans to 4 percent of its outstanding loans from 6 percent, Marc J. Shapiro, the bank's vice chairman for finance and risk management, said in a recent conference call with analysts.
IT plans to ultimately reduce its exposure to these loans further, though the bank is reluctant to sell right now since prices for these companies' debt are depressed.
"We have had a strategy for some time to reduce our concentrations," said Donald H. McCree III, the head of global credit management at J. P. Morgan. In addition to selling parts of loans as its arranges them, the bank has also been selling more of its share later in the secondary market. "But if you sell a large part of your portfolio as a distressed seller, you won't get value for it," he said.
Ms. Dublon, the chief financial officer, agreed that the bank would have to wait a while to reduce the size of its loan portfolio.
"I don't think all that we want to do is achievable in the short term," she said.
She also dismissed speculation that J. P. Morgan will take an extraordinarily large charge against earnings in the fourth quarter to write down the value of its riskier loans as well as investments in these industries made by its private equity arm, JPMorgan Partners, which has already lost $699 million this year.
"THIS notion some people have that you can front-load everything that might go wrong is a mistaken and naive notion," she said. "It is not allowed under accounting rules to do that."
If the bank took an extraordinarily large charge, that would reduce its capital and might also make the rating agencies nervous, said Steven Wharton, an analyst at Loomis, Sayles & Company.
Some of J. P. Morgan's competitors were quicker to sell their problem loans earlier in the economic cycle. Bank of America, for example, reduced its outstanding large corporate loans to $60 billion in the latest quarter from $94 billion in January 2001. In contrast, at J. P. Morgan, outstanding loans declined to $97 billion from $119 billion in the same period.
Bank of America was spurred to sell part of its loan portfolio after the heavy losses it suffered on its share of a $1.7 billion loan to the Sunbeam Corporation in late 2000. J. P. Morgan executives say that the problems with their telecommunications loans got serious much more recently.
While the industry has been under pressure for some time, it took a while for the losses suffered by stockholders to affect the banks, which are the first creditors to get paid off in the event of a bankruptcy, said Suzanne Hammett, the head of credit risk policy at the bank.
Some analysts said they have resigned themselves to a long wait for the lending and private equity businesses to recover. They are looking for signs of stability elsewhere first.
"The money's been lent and the money has been invested," said Henry H. McVey, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. "What management can control is the trading business."
Fair enough, believes Ms. Dublon. She said that the bank was now focused on a straightforward strategy: "Be honest about what the issues are, and to deliver stronger results."
She, along with Mr. Harrison and the rest of the bank's management, can only hope investors have the patience to wait.

HEADLINE: TALKING MONEY WITH DAN MARINO; 
Playing It Cautious After the Game's Over

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
HOW comes the hard part. 
 For 15 years, Dan Marino just kept earning more money. Soon after joining the Miami Dolphins in 1983 with a four-year, $2.1 million contract, he became their star quarterback. By the time he retired after the 1999 season, he was earning $6 million a year. 
 In the interim, the high-school-handsome quarterback with the tousled hair and perfect high-arc passes became one of the most popular players in pro football. His indomitable spirit, which kept him on the field when he was so badly injured that even walking seemed tough, helped make him a legend in South Florida. 
Some sports legends make it to both the Hall of Fame and bankruptcy court. But not Dan Marino. In all the years he was mesmerizing fans with his comeback drives, his contracts totaled about $50 million and he amassed a nest egg that associates now value at $40 million to $45 million. Although Mr. Marino declined to comment specifically, they say he has about $23 million in liquid assets, $15 million in personal real estate and several million dollars in private investments that include a golf course, office buildings and a bank. 
He is still a big earner: as a co-host of "Inside the N.F.L." on HBO and "The N.F.L. Today" on CBS, Mr. Marino probably takes home about $2 million a year. And he continues to earn more than $1 million a year from endorsements for Nabisco, part of Kraft Foods, as well as AutoNation, the car dealership chain, associates say.
But the shift to a career as a sportscaster is a big one. Gone are the Sundays when Mr. Marino felt "like he was in control of the whole afternoon." 
His TV performances have been successful. Since Mr. Marino joined CBS, it has narrowed the ratings gap with Fox's "N.F.L. Sunday." Still, there is no telling how long that career will last. Neither Joe Montana nor Joe Namath made it on television.
"When athletes play, they view themselves as invincible," said Marvin Demoff, Mr. Marino's longtime agent. "Once you stop playing and you go to the network, you realize that other people can do what you do, and lots of them don't work out."
While quarterbacks are expert at sizing up situations and overseeing split-second responses, Mr. Marino has shown little interest in playing that role on the investment turf. Mr. Marino rarely disagrees with his advisers.
The end of his playing career has already affected how Mr. Marino, 41, thinks about money. According to Mr. Demoff, two years ago Mr. Marino considered moving to a costlier home, with an estimated price of about $14 million, on Jupiter Island, Fla. Though cost was only one factor, he ultimately decided against it. 
Not that he does not live well. He and his wife, Claire, and their six children -- including two adopted daughters -- live in a palatial Italian-style villa in Westin, Fla., near Ft. Lauderdale. 
The formal living room -- with marble floors, velvet sofas and cathedral ceilings -- could be found in many a high-end house. But the family room bears the mark of Mr. Marino's fame. Aside from the requisite giant-screen television and oversize leather arm chairs, there are glass cabinets crammed with trophies.
A golf cart sits in the driveway alongside his 1989 Porsche -- the only car he owns, but not the only one he drives. AutoNation routinely lends him cars. He is now driving a Ford Excursion. 
Sitting in his family room, dressed in blue slacks and a sports shirt, he talked somewhat hesitantly about his finances. He did not, in fact, seem greatly interested in investments. Frequently, he would refer either to Mr. Demoff, now a managing director for Neuberger Berman L.L.C., an asset management firm in New York, where he oversees a division that handles investments for athletes, or to his money manager, Francis Frankel, known as Shorty, also at Neuberger. "My business is me," Mr. Marino said. "I let them do the investing."
Though he has hung onto much of his fortune, Mr. Marino does not compare himself to stars like John Elway, once quarterback for the Denver Broncos, who built a series of car dealerships. "John prides himself on being a businessman," Mr. Marino said. "I never did." He can tick off some stocks he owns, but his first interest remains sports and his television programs.
He and his wife have done well in real estate, though, in part because prices in South Florida have risen so sharply. Their sun-washed yellow home, surrounded by bougainvillea, is not their only holding, though it is by far the costliest. One local real estate agent valued it at $8 million. 
In 1991, they bought land on Jupiter Island, planning one day to build the beach house his wife wanted. "We paid about $1 million for the lot, but it was a great investment," he said. The land is now probably worth about $4 million, real estate agents say. The couple also own a small house elsewhere on Jupiter, valued about $1.5 million. 
Two years ago, the Marinos saw that dream house, and contemplated selling the lot and the two houses they already owned. 
BUT first Mr. Marino turned for advice to Mr. Demoff, who made a chart detailing how Mr. Marino's finances would change if he bought the house. At the time, Mr. Marino did not have two television deals, and Mr. Demoff concluded that with Mr. Marino's future earning power unsure, such a large purchase carried a certain risk. 
"Once Dan saw that risk, he said, 'O.K., I will do nothing -- I will start worrying more about the future,' " Mr. Demoff recalled. 
Mr. Marino's request for a detailed economic analysis of the move was no surprise to his advisers. "Dan has always been someone who asked: 'Am I doing O.K.?' " Mr. Demoff said. "He always worries."
Today about 60 percent of Mr. Marino's liquid portfolio is in stocks, and the balance in tax-free bonds. The money is managed by Mr. Frankel, who has worked with Mr. Marino since 1984. Over the last six years, the equity portfolio has risen 7 percent on an annualized basis, exceeding the S.& P. 500 by more than 1 percentage point a year. 
Like many star athletes, Mr. Marino is frequently approached with ideas, often from restaurant chains. Some have worked. The Dan Marino Town Tavern, in which Mr. Marino traded his name and advertising clout for equity, is about to open a fifth restaurant in Florida. But he has also been burned. A restaurant chain in Texas, Italian Oven, failed. And an investment in Einstein Bagels also did poorly. 
Mr. Marino has long been cautious about money. The only son of a driver who delivered newspapers, Mr. Marino and his two sisters grew up in a blue-collar Pittsburgh suburb, where his father frequently tossed a football with him in the backyard. 
The family lived simply. "I don't remember my dad having any money," Mr. Marino said. "We lived week to week. On Fridays, my Dad did his books and paid his bills. He might have 40 bucks or 20 bucks for the week. We didn't go on vacation. We didn't leave Pennsylvania until they began recruiting me for colleges like Clemson and Notre Dame."
Like many working-class children, Dan Marino held a series of odd jobs, from mowing lawns to shoveling snow, but he dreamed of becoming a star athlete. While mowing lawns in the summer, he vowed he would never do that kind of work when he was older. 
He was so obsessed with sports that he did not watch much television or show an interest in cars, his father, Dan Marino Sr., recalled. In fact, three learner's permits expired before the young athlete finally got his license at 18.
At the University of Pittsburgh, he was a star quarterback, but he was only the 27th selection in the National Football League 1983 draft. Finally the Miami Dolphins' head coach, Don Shula, grabbed him. 
Mr. Marino's father introduced him to Mr. Demoff, then a well-known agent and lawyer. When "I first met Dan, he had no sense at all about money," Mr. Demoff recalled. 
After he signed with the Dolphins, "I remember putting $50,000 in the bank and living my first season off it," Mr. Marino said. "I had a car. I got myself a nice new stereo and I was happy." 
Mr. Marino was quickly befriended by Steve Clark, a Miami lineman whose father, Spence Clark, was a money manager in Utah. Mr. Marino hired the elder Mr. Clark to handle his investments.
Mr. Clark put some of Mr. Marino's money in real estate tax shelters, which were already coming under government scrutiny. Mr. Demoff recalled that when he looked at Mr. Marino's finances the first time, "I was very uncomfortable." He added: "It didn't pass the smell test. I had two major accounting firms do independent reports." In fact, he said, "I found that Clark had had some trouble with the I.R.S." 
When asked if he had had problems with the government, Mr. Clark said, "Not really." In a telephone interview last week, he added: "We won about 20 cases with the I.R.S. We had averaged a 35 percent rate of return on people's money."
Mr. Demoff told Mr. Marino, "You are not going to like this, but you are wrong to be working with Clark, and I want you to switch."
Mr. Demoff, who by then was also representing Mr. Elway, introduced him to Charles Dostal, Mr. Elway's adviser, as well as Mr. Frankel, then a money manager at Lehman Brothers and an avid football fan. Mr. Marino chose Mr. Frankel. "He had a good track record and we just kind of clicked," Mr. Marino said.
OVER the years Mr. Demoff replaced other advisers as well. "We used to have annual 'state of the union' meetings at Dan's house with Shorty, myself and the accountants," he said. "I watched the accountant in a meeting with the Marinos. He was going over expenses by line item and he got to landscaping and told Claire that the line item was too high," Mr. Demoff said. "Danny got annoyed and Claire got upset. The Marinos don't need to be scolded. We found another accountant."
Perhaps because he has such a strong relationship with his own father, Mr. Marino has "put my trust in Shorty," who is 70. 
Mr. Marino has never been a stock picker, though he can tick off conservative holdings like Wal-Mart, Pfizer and Citigroup. And he appreciates that Mr. Frankel "didn't go real hard into the tech stuff." Mr. Frankel, a dedicated value investor, said he was always cautious about technology stocks. 
Mr. Frankel said Mr. Marino's portfolio was up about 5 percent in 2001, but down about the same amount this year. "This year has been my Waterloo," he said in an interview. 
Over the years, Mr. Frankel has moved more of Mr. Marino's investments to bonds because of his income needs. 
Those needs are large. The Marinos' son Michael, now 15, is autistic.
That probably affected the family more than any other single experience. At first the Marinos did not realize anything was wrong, but by the age of 2 Michael was still not talking, and tests soon revealed his condition. 
The discovery stunned both Marinos, who poured enormous energy into getting their son the best help possible. Michael's illness also propelled the Marinos into philanthropy. They established a foundation that raises money to help children with development disabilities. To date the foundation has raised $3.6 million. (At a recent black-tie fund-raiser, Mr. Marino got up and sang a mean version of "Mustang Sally.")
TODAY Michael is in a regular school. "He started mainstreaming about five years ago," his grandfather said. "He is doing great." 
Mr. Marino know he has an expensive lifestyle. His other children are all in private school, he bought a house for his parents, "and my wife is not cheap either," he said fondly.
And he is keenly aware that his children do not understand how unusual their lives are. "It will take time for them to realize how difficult it is to duplicate this life-style," he said. But with his current discipline, he will probably serve as a good role model.

HEADLINE: Is Time Behind Bars Bad P.R.? 

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI

 BODY:
TWO nights before Halloween, a group of demicelebrities who included the singer Samantha Cole and Nicky Hilton gathered at Q, a downtown billiard bar, to toast Nick Carter's debut solo album, "Now or Never." The shaggy-haired Mr. Carter, best known as the cute one from the Backstreet Boys, drank Jagermeister shots. Partygoers shot pool as the strains of Mr. Carter's single "Help Me" thumped through the smoky room.
 Even though Mr. Carter left to attend a party given by Joey Fatone (from the rival boy band 'N Sync), Mr. Carter's debut party was an acceptable public-relations hit, attracting at least one semidemiquasi-famous model and generating a few mentions in gossip columns. 
 Pretty amazing, given that the event's publicist, Lizzie Grubman, was 90 miles away, serving the first week of a 60-day sentence in the Suffolk County jail in Riverhead, N.Y. 
Ms. Grubman's peculiar circumstances have onlookers, clients and business associates wondering how helpful publicity can be if it comes from a firm whose namesake is behind bars, and asking who will hire a publicist famous for stumbling into one of the worst publicity gaffes of recent times.
After Ms. Grubman ends her jail term -- she is expected to get out on Nov. 29, assuming she earns time off for good behavior -- she will have to rebuild a business that has suffered badly since her arrest in July 2001, dropping from about 30 employees to 15 and stung by the defection of many prestigious clients.
In the 13 months between July 2001, when Ms. Grubman reversed her father's Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle into a crowd of Southampton clubgoers, and August of this year, when she pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and to a misdemeanor assault charge, many of her stalwart clients in the music business continued to employ her, generally to organize parties. But other clients -- the image-conscious purveyors of luxury goods and services that paid $10,000 monthly retainer fees -- have left, including Chanel and the City Club Hotel in Manhattan. Executives at Escada, MAC Cosmetics, Bottega Veneta and Louis Vuitton, for whom Ms. Grubman once organized occasional parties, said they probably would not use her again because of her tarnished reputation.
"Nobody likes to be associated with something as obnoxious as this was, even indirectly," said Linda Buzzell, a career consultant to people in the entertainment industry. But if any industry allows for second acts -- and third and fourth ones -- it is entertainment, an alternative universe of ego and ambition that acknowledges only two career-ending sins. "One is to be dull, and the other is to be desperate," Ms. Buzzell said. "She's neither of those yet."
Brenda Loughery, the chief operating officer of Lizzie Grubman Public Relations, said that the company is doing fine, although she acknowledged that it had suffered, in part because of Ms. Grubman's arrest and its aftermath, and in part because of a falloff in party and event planning since the Sept. 11 attacks.
"Like any business in a fluctuating economy," Ms. Loughery said, "if revenue decreases, we adjust our overhead. Our bottom line for 2002 has grown over last year." 
She would not elaborate on why some clients have left. "I don't want to comment on every client who has come and gone over the years, because things change," she said. 
Ms. Grubman was sentenced to 60 days in jail, 280 hours of community service and five years' probation. At least eight people injured in the accident filed suits against her, seeking millions of dollars.
"There are some pending, but they will be wrapped up within a reasonable period of time," Stephen P. Scaring, her lawyer, said last week.
Luxury brands that seek an image of refinement appear particularly put off by the months of tabloid scrutiny that followed Ms. Grubman's arrest, when she was held up as a too-tan, too-blond poster child of the spoiled rich and a symbol of class warfare pitting the nouveau riche against working people in the Hamptons. It was these clients that Ms. Grubman worked hard to attract, and her success with them seemed to point to an expanding career.
One executive who did business with Ms. Grubman prearrest said he stopped afterward because of the tabloid notoriety that followed, which seemed in direct proportion to the glossy high profile Ms. Grubman had cultivated before her troubles.
"The younger publicists make a name for themselves and get a lot of attention and then attach your product to themselves," said this executive, who refused to be quoted by name on the advice of his own public relations counsel. "They don't stay quiet, unlike some of the more experienced people. And if their star falls, so does yours."
In April 2000, Ms. Grubman's firm handled the PEN literary gala at Lincoln Center. A PEN executive said on Friday that it was unlikely that PEN would use her again.
In September 2000, Ms. Grubman promoted the Louis Vuitton Classic, an automobile show, at Rockefeller Center, but its parent company, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, also has no plans to use her agency in the future, said Heather Vandenberghe, a spokeswoman.
When Bottega Veneta opened a SoHo boutique in October 2000, Ms. Grubman organized the party. Lisa Pomerantz, a spokeswoman for Bottega Veneta Inc., said the company had no plans to use the agency again. "Based on the event is how we choose the appropriate agency," she said. "She's a very bright girl, but that was a different time."
The departure of two key staff members has also hurt Ms. Grubman. In December, Peggy Siegal left, taking along her business -- largely promoting movie premieres and the famous people involved. Five months ago, a longtime friend of Ms. Grubman, Liz Cohen, resigned, telling friends that for months she had landed no new clients because of the cloud over Ms. Grubman. She took one client, the clothing line Language, with her. (Ms. Siegal and Ms. Cohen have joined with two other publicists, Harriet Weintraub and Virginia Coleman, to form a new partnership, WSCC.)
Ms. Loughery said that several clients are still paying monthly retainer fees. They include the Toronto-based Blue Mountain Wallcoverings company and its American division, Olney; LQ, a Midtown nightclub; Sessa, a new restaurant in Chelsea; and Roc-a-Fella Records, whose stars include Jay-Z. Other clients include Pony sneakers. 
Music clients for whom Ms. Grubman's firm has organized parties, like Sean Combs, are not likely to shy away from a publicist because she has been in jail, said Eric Cohen, the president of Whirlwind Entertainment of New York, which hired Ms. Grubman's firm to promote a party for the singer Dru Hill on Wednesday at the World.
"I think controversy like this, to the music industry, is not such a big deal," Mr. Cohen said. "It's not like corporate America. Going to jail is something that happens. And this was one accident."
Mr. Combs, for example, was tried on charges of gun possession and bribery after a 1999 nightclub shooting. He was acquitted; his protege Jamal Barrow was sentenced to 10 years in the incident. And the world of rap music is thick with references to crime and prison; in some lyrics, both represent rites of passage.
Public relations executives at other firms predict that Ms. Grubman's business will survive in part because of her notoriety. Marvet Britto, president of the Britto Agency in New York, which represents Angela Bassett and Foxy Brown, said a demand will always exist for what Ms. Grubman does. "Hype and results are what people hire her to do," Ms. Britto said. "And she will always have the hype, and she will always be able to put pretty people into a room. If she can deliver the bodies, they will still keep hiring her."
Delivering bodies came easy to Ms. Grubman at the beginning of her career, in large part because of the influence of her father, Allen Grubman, the entertainment lawyer, whose clients have included Tommy Mottola, David Geffen, Mr. Combs, Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Jackson and Madonna.
Like many well-to-do and well-connected parents, Mr. Grubman gave his daughter his help. When she graduated from college, he called Nadine Johnson, the head of a New York public relations firm bearing her name, and asked her to consider his daughter for a job.
After a year Ms. Grubman left to start her own firm, taking some other employees, including Ms. Loughery.
In 1997, Ms. Grubman's firm put together just two events -- the release party for Sony's "Men in Black" soundtrack, and an 18th-birthday party for a model from the Ford agency. The next year, the firm produced nine events, for clients like Gloria Estefan and Epic Records.
Specializing in representing nightclubs like Moomba, Ms. Grubman was able to attract celebrities and prominent music-industry executives (many of them associates of her father) to the clubs, generating coverage in gossip columns.
After the Dec. 7, 1998, issue of New York magazine called Ms. Grubman one of the "Power Girls" of publicity, the firm's business tripled. It produced 25 events in 1999, including Mr. Mottola's Grammy party and parties for the Backstreet Boys, Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears and Jay-Z.
Later in 1999, Ms. Grubman hired Ms. Cohen and her assistant, Jessica Meisels, away from a rival firm, Harrison & Shriftman. Ms. Meisels now runs the Grubman agency's three-person office in Los Angeles.
In 2000, Ms. Grubman joined forces with Ms. Siegal, a public relations expert with 30 years of experience and good connections to Manhattan's wealthy social figures. That year, Lizzie Grubman Public Relations produced 46 events.
Although Ms. Grubman and Ms. Siegal portrayed their merger as a way to bridge generations, many friends and business colleagues found it an odd pairing from the start. "Peggy would stand at those rap parties of Lizzie's and just look extremely uncomfortable," one Grubman employee said. Ms. Grubman was quietly polite when Ms. Siegal introduced her to friends like the gossip columnist Liz Smith and the writer and director Nora Ephron at lunches at Le Cirque.
But the bond didn't take. Five months after Ms. Grubman's arrest, Ms. Siegal quit. 
Steven Stoute, the executive vice president of Universal Music for the Interscope Geffen A&M Records label, said that Ms. Grubman's relationships with the music industry will remain solid and that she will plan events for his labels in the future.
"She will survive, and she will do it on her own," Mr. Stoute said. "She brings a pizazz and glamour to the business. Since she hasn't been involved, no one has stepped up who has that glamour."
As for Ms. Grubman's frame of mind in jail, Ms. Loughery said that she is reading Danielle Steel novels and writing long letters to friends and family members. "She can't wait to get back," Ms. Loughery said. "She has been consumed by what has been going on, and she can't wait to get back to work."
Karen Bell, a spokeswoman at Tommy Hilfiger, said she hoped Ms. Grubman could put the ordeal behind her. "I have a soft heart," she said, adding that if Ms. Grubman's business revives, it will make quite a comeback story.
And Ms. Grubman is making no effort to hide her light under a bushel as she serves her time, according to a friend who has spoken to her by telephone. "She told me she had been signing autographs for the inmates," the friend said.

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the professional prospects of Lizzie Grubman, the publicist who is serving a jail term for assault and leaving the scene of an accident, misstated her firm's relationship with Chanel, a former client. Chanel hired the firm for occasional parties; it did not pay a monthly retainer fee.
The article referred incorrectly to participants in two Grubman promotions. Sessa is a cocktail lounge, not a restaurant; Dru Hill is a band, not a singer.
The article also misstated the number of events produced by the firm in three past years. In 1997, it was 7, not 2; in 1998, it was 26, not 9; in 1999, it was 33, not 25. (The number of events did not triple in 1999.)
An article on Nov. 17 about the professional prospects of Lizzie Grubman, the publicist who recently served a jail term for assault and leaving the scene of an accident, misstated her educational background. She left college before receiving a degree; she did not graduate.

HEADLINE: Shot in the Arm for Tort Overhaul 

BYLINE:  By ADAM LIPTAK 

 BODY:
THE politics of overhauling American tort law are anything but straightforward. They involve odd alliances, ideological paradoxes and a great deal of money.
 Yet it is all but certain that the Republican Party's election victories will move the call for reform, sought by the business world for years, higher on the legislative agenda. 
 "It's going to be a hot priority," said Joan Claybrook, the president of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group. "It's going to be brutal." 
When it's all over, the rules governing tort actions -- the civil lawsuits, usually for money, claiming wrongful conduct by defendants, usually companies -- may well change drastically.
"Reform" -- a capacious and loaded term usually used by defendants -- is most likely in the areas of class actions and punitive damages, especially involving asbestos liability and medical malpractice, among other issues. Proponents will no doubt use enormous punitive awards, like the $28 billion awarded last month by a Los Angeles jury to a single plaintiff in a tobacco lawsuit, as a rallying cry. The frivolous suits filed each year also provide ammunition. The American Tort Reform Association's Web site even lists "loony lawsuits," like one saying the haunted house at Universal Studios in Orlando, Fla., is too scary.
Despite the anger those cases incite, even among the general public, earlier Republican Congresses have been cautious in addressing the issue. But George W. Bush, as governor of Texas, pushed through sweeping limits on tort suits. Days after taking office in 1995, he declared a legislative emergency to address the "junk lawsuits that clog our courts." He asked for -- and got -- limits on punitive damages, curbs on awards in cases with multiple defendants and restrictions on where suits can be filed. 
"It was far more successful than anyone thought the Legislature would go for," said Frank B. Cross, a law and business professor at the University of Texas at Austin.
The victory was particular striking given the strength of the opposition. "At least until fairly recently, parts of Texas had a reputation for being very plaintiff-friendly," said Joseph Sanders, a law professor at the University of Houston. "They talked about it the way they now talk about Mississippi."
DEMOCRATS and Republicans have always had competing philosophies about civil justice, said Philip K. Howard, author of "The Death of Common Sense" (Random House, 1995), which argues that society has become too reliant on regulations and lawsuits. He is also the founder of Common Good, an advocacy group that supports broad changes.
Lawsuits, he said, enjoy "a superficial appeal which is consistent with traditional liberal rhetoric, that the little guy has the right to litigate." This litigation culture, Mr. Howard added, is supported by "the private-jet crowd" of trial lawyers, who have generally been big contributors to Democratic politicians.
Yet the legislative discussion is largely based on apocryphal or at least anomalous lawsuits, said Stephen Daniels, a senior research fellow at the American Bar Foundation, which is a nonpartisan research group. "Some of it is philosophical debate, but most of it is the clash of interest groups," he said. 
Pushing the issue called tort reform has never been as important to Republicans as opposing it is to Democrats. "It looms so large in Democratic Party power politics," said Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute. By contrast, said George L. Priest, a law professor at Yale, "the Republicans are not single-minded."
The Republicans must also try to reconcile support for legislation that would have its greatest impact in the state courts with their traditional philosophical commitment to federalism, which would leave most local matters to the states.
Still, with a president who has made tort reform a signature issue and with the Democrats on the run, "if the Republicans are smart, they can get more than they have ever gotten," said John Coale, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Washington and a major contributor to Democrats.
Four issues top the legislative agenda.
"Class-action reform is probably the most ripe in terms of the work that's been done," said James M. Wootton, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce's Institute for Legal Reform. A bill called the Class Action Fairness Act of 2001, which was passed by the House in March, would allow defendants to move major interstate class actions filed in state courts to federal courts. That would address the complaint by defendants that a few out-of-the way courts, in places like Madison County, Ill., are too friendly to plaintiffs and thus handle a disproportionate number of class actions.
A bill to address medical malpractice claims was passed by the House in September and will probably resurface. It would shorten the statute of limitations, limit certain kinds of damages, disallow claims where regulators have approved the product in question and give courts the power to review lawyers' contingency fees, which entitle them to a percentage of what plaintiffs win.
Legislation that is likely to be introduced in the next Congress would address the internecine disputes among lawyers who represent plaintiffs who were exposed to asbestos and have actual or potential ailments.
And legislation may also be introduced to cap big punitive awards, which loom large in the public debate on all tort reform issues.
Advocates of tort reform like to justify their agenda by pointing to big punitive awards, meant to punish and deter rather than to compensate. Opponents say those awards are unusual and generally justified, but they are often reversed on appeal.
Last month, the Supreme Court of California, in a 4-to-3 decision, declined to hear a challenge to the largest punitive award ever affirmed in American history in a personal injury case. The decision let stand a $290 million award by a jury in Ceres, Calif., to the family of three people killed in the rollover of a Ford Bronco in 1993.
Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for Ford, said his client would ask the United States Supreme Court to hear the case. He added that the outsized award, sustained at all three levels of the state court system, demonstrated why federal legislative action was needed.
LAWYERS for Juan Romo, one of the surviving family members, said the award was justified by Ford's conduct in making what the family called "the weakest roof in Ford's history." Made of fiberglass, the roof was sold by Ford as "tough" and "rugged"; the roof's design included a hollow hump that suggested the presence of a rollover bar even though it did not have one.
Other big punitive awards imposed recently in a variety of cases have also made headlines. The biggest is that $28 billion in punitive damages given by a California jury last month, an award in a suit brought by a smoker with lung cancer who accused the Philip Morris Companies of luring her into a lifelong tobacco habit with fraudulent advertising and marketing.
The United States Supreme Court is considering whether State Farm Insurance must pay a policyholder $145 million in punitive damages, in addition to $2.6 million in compensatory damages, in a car-accident insurance dispute. The Alabama Supreme Court is reviewing a $3.4 billion punitive award, on top of a $90 million compensatory award, in a case about the interpretation of an offshore gas lease.
Plaintiffs' lawyers say punitive awards are quite unusual.
"Seeing a check in the mail from a punitive award is very, very rare," Mr. Coale said.
To address the issue of excessive awards, Mr. Boutrous contended, Congress should consider limiting each state's court system to imposing damages based on a defendant's conduct only in that state.
Another approach was suggested by Lori S. Nugent, a Chicago lawyer who represents corporate defendants. "One of the most effective reforms would be to mandate trials in three phases," she said. Under that system, a jury would first decide whether and how much the defendant must pay in compensation, then whether punitive damages were warranted. Only after that would the jury set the amount of any damages.
Such micromanagement of state judicial systems is not universally endorsed, even by people who generally favor changes in this area.
"A federal legislature would be loath to impose a procedural limit on state proceedings," Mr. Boutrous said, "and I am not even sure that they could."
Ms. Nugent argued, though, that the federal government could and should act. "It's a wish-list item," she said. "But when you see the kind of drain that punitive damages is placing on the economy, it joins the ranks of reality."
Regardless of whether the issue of punitive damage awards is addressed, the asbestos crisis may well move toward a resolution. "The Supreme Court seems to have given Congress a strong hint that it needs to do something about the asbestos crisis," said Catherine M. Sharkey, a fellow at Columbia Law School.
In 1999, in the process of setting aside a $1.5 billion class-action settlement in an asbestos case, the Supreme Court referred to what it called "the elephantine mass of asbestos cases" that "defies customary judicial administration and calls for national legislation."
"Asbestos will be on the agenda in the next Congress," Mr. Howard said, "and that bill will be supported by plaintiffs' lawyers who represent people who are actually sick."
Mr. Howard was referring to internecine disputes between lawyers who represent people who have actually developed cancer and other symptoms of asbestos exposure and those who are suing on behalf of people who fear getting sick in years to come. The finite sums of money available are likely to mean that not everyone can be compensated.
Michael E. Baroody, executive vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said legislation to address this issue was likely.
"The courts are not distinguishing between people who are sick now, and genuinely so, and people who have been exposed," Mr. Baroody said. He said he expected that legislation to establish medical criteria, at the least, would be introduced in the next Congress. 
In addition, he said, Congress could suspend statutes of limitations to ensure that those who did not sue immediately would lose no rights.
There is proposed legislation on broader medical issues, too, much of it driven by what doctors call an insurance crisis. Even Mississippi, widely regarded as one of the forums most receptive to plaintiffs' suits, recently enacted legislation curbing medical malpractice suits. 
It apparently had to -- the market had intervened.
"When there is no doctor around, you really notice," Professor Priest said. "You notice it less if there are fewer products to buy."
Mr. Coale said caps would be unwise and unwarranted. "I have had clients with catastrophic medical injuries, and they really need this money," he said. 
By most accounts, however, the Republican majority in the new Congress is facing treacherous political terrain on the tort reform issue.
"It's very scary for those of us concerned about protecting the jury system," said Joanne Doroshow, the executive director of the Center for Justice and Democracy, a consumer group that focuses on the civil courts, "but it's hardly a done deal that Congress will start passing huge amounts of tort reform."
Mr. Nugent, a defense lawyer, said action like that was likely. 
"We are now in a political environment where reform has a real shot," he said, "and that will save jobs and help the economy."
Ralph Nader, the former presidential candidate, said he agreed that legislation was likely. But he thinks it will backfire. "The Republicans will attack the civil justice system," he said. "That will sharpen and focus the issues, and it will boomerang against them."

The Entrepreneurial Zeal Of Dog Walkers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Packs of Rival Dog Walkers Circle One Another and Growl" (Nov. 10), about Brooklyn's highly competitive world of dog walking: If an unemployed lawyer can earn a six-figure salary walking dogs, what does that indicate about the state of the economy? 
 My husband and I were walking our dog in Central Park Sunday morning after reading your article when an enterprising 40-something man approached. 
"Do you have a dog walker?" he asked, offering a flyer hot off the printer. I told him I did.
"Oh," he replied, disappointed. "How does that work? Do you go through an agency or something?"
I patiently explained that I walk my own dog. He seemed incredulous.
Encouraging his entrepreneurial drive, I added: "It's a great job. I pay myself a hundred thousand a year."
He walked off muttering.

HEADLINE: Promoting Fair Trade 

 BODY:
To The Editor:
 If you read two recent articles side by side -- "War Inflates Cocoa Prices but Leaves Africans Poor" (Oct. 31) and "Global Issues Flow Into America's Coffee" (Nov. 3) -- you reach a conclusion that neither article alone makes clear, namely that the present system for bringing cocoa and coffee to market is grossly exploitative of poor farmers, and that consumers are increasingly unwilling to be a part of that exploitation. But between farmers and consumers are middlemen and multinational corporations, which are apparently both economically cushioned against the market swings and emotionally detached from how market forces consistently impoverish millions of hard-working people in rural Third World communities. 
 However, from our 16 years inside the coffee and, more recently, cocoa industries, we at Equal Exchange know that it doesn't have to be this way and that there is a market out there for companies who choose to buck the system. In contrast with what was suggested by some industry representatives in the two articles, we, and a handful of peers, have found that the fair trade system is able to address much of the worst exploitation in both industries while being commercially viable.

HEADLINE: BackTalk; 
Facing Unpleasant Facts After Breeders' Cup Scandal

BYLINE:  By TIM SMITH; Tim Smith is the commissioner of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association.

 BODY:
At the National Thoroughbred Racing Association and Breeders' Cup, we want to get back to public debates like Pat Day versus Jerry Bailey, Wayne Lukas versus Bob Baffert. We want speculation over next year's Triple Crown contenders or what the latest Storm Cat-Serena's Song foal might bring next year at the summer sales. And, as winter approaches, we long for a fresh case of Derby fever.
 The truth is, though, we can't responsibly go back to business as usual in our sport without unblinkingly facing some unpleasant facts brought to light after the pick-six betting scandal on Breeders' Cup day. While proof and guilt are matters for courts and juries to decide, it is clear that the security of at least some aspects of the sport's electronic wagering system have been breached. It is also clear that many of horse racing's most avid fans and best customers are justifiably concerned about overall system integrity. 
 Only three weeks ago, my colleagues and I were celebrating one of the most successful days in horse racing's colorful history. Our sport's Super Bowl, the Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships, at Arlington Park, drew a sellout crowd. NBC's national audience for the event was up 18 percent over 2001.
Equally important -- since legal wagering ultimately finances our prize money and other costs -- a wagering record for Breeders' Cup day was set: a total of $116 million, including $100 million handled through hundreds of off-track facilities and through authorized telephone or computer account wagering services.
Within 24 hours, however, the celebration ended. The N.T.R.A., based on questionable circumstances surrounding winning wagers totaling more than $3 million on the Breeders' Cup pick-six, was asking Arlington Park to stop payment and formally requesting the New York State Racing and Wagering Board to start a thorough investigation of the suspicious bets, which were made through the Catskill OTB in New York.
Within a few days, an N.T.R.A. task force began work on initial, short-term steps to improve wagering security with racetrack owners, state regulators and totalisator companies. (Totes perform the arithmetic involved in parimutuel wagering and also handle communications of the wagering information from offtrack or simulcast sites to the host track and its wagering pool.)
Within a week, the N.T.R.A. retained the computer security unit of Ernst & Young to do an initial assessment of horse racing's simulcast-wagering systems. The firm's experts, who work mainly with large banks and electronic commerce companies, explained the role of their attack and penetration team, a group of in-house hackers who would begin testing immediately. I asked when the testing would be completed, and the sobering answer essentially was, "If your industry is smart, never."
Before the Breeders' Cup, I worked to improve TV ratings for horse racing, get new fans to try a day at the track and the thinking person's wager, and to recruit more national sponsors. Now, whole days are spent on topics like progressive scanning (asking the totes to transmit wagering details before each leg of a multileg bet, reducing the time window for potential fraud) and wagering forensics (steps like keeping records of every phone wager).
This is essential, because while it is true that the Breeders' Cup pick six allegations involve an inside job versus computer hacking, it is also the case that the industry's security technology and procedures require updating and improvement.
The immediate, short-term steps taken recently by the industry are a good start. Horse racing's real test, however, lies ahead. In a sport and business increasingly involved in electronic commerce, new investment in systems security will be needed to protect the sport's integrity and earn public trust. The best practices in wagering security will need to become standards. Overreaction on the part of regulators will need to be avoided, however, as new protections and safeguards are implemented.
The stakes are high. At issue are things like the game's future growth, the 472,000 jobs involved in horse racing and directly related businesses, and the economics of the large agribusiness -- horse-breeding farms -- that underlies the sport.
Any business should listen to its customers. Horse racing has an added reason to include its frequent participants in the current process. In horse racing, bettors compete against each other, with tracks taking a fee to cover purses and other operating costs of putting on the show. In a real sense, handicappers, along with the equine and human athletes competing on the track, are the show.
For its millions of passionate fans, horse racing combines spectator sport with a challenging wagering game to produce compelling entertainment. That the wagering part is not simple or easy is actually a key part of its allure. Indeed, maintaining this defining characteristic of the sport is what we are being asked by our customers to assure: that hitting the pick six will always be hard, and never again easy.

HEADLINE: South Africa Urges the West To Ease Censure of Zimbabwe 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Nov. 16 

 BODY:
Cameras flashed and reporters scribbled as the foreign ministers of South Africa and Zimbabwe met this week with hearty handshakes. Then South Africa announced that it was time for the world to ease the pressure on its troubled neighbor.
 The South African foreign minister, Dr. Nkosazana Zuma, said it was time for Western nations to consider ending penalties they imposed on Zimbabwe for intimidating opposition party supporters, judges, journalists and white farmers, and manipulating the presidential election. 
 She also called on Britain, Zimbabwe's former colonial ruler, to compensate white farmers who have been forced to give up their farms without compensation. Zimbabwe, which has ordered nearly 3,000 white farmers to give their properties to blacks, says its contentious land reform process is now complete.
Referring to the penalties, Dr. Zuma, speaking as she stood next to Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge of Zimbabwe during the news conference in Pretoria, said, "We don't think that's a situation which should continue for a long time." 
Dr. Zuma's remarks were greeted with outrage from supporters of Zimbabwe's opposition party and many political analysts in South Africa. Over the past two and a half years, the government of President Robert Mugabe has condoned the killings of scores of black opposition party supporters. The intimidation of black government critics and white farmers continues. Zimbabwe's economy is also in tatters, and on Saturday the government reimposed sweeping price controls, Reuters reported. 
Zimbabwe's opposition party and civic groups have accused the government of denying emergency food to people who refuse to support the governing party. Last month, the United Nations suspended food distribution in the community of Insiza when government-backed militants seized three tons of food for their supporters before a local election. 
Asked whether South Africa was condoning lawlessness, Dr. Zuma said it was important to look ahead. "Even if Zimbabwe made a mistake, the point is that we need to move to the future," she said. 
Western nations, notably the United States and Britain, have urged South Africa to take a harder line, recognizing that President Thabo Mbeki often describes himself as a champion of African democracy. 
He has rallied support for a development plan that would steer Western aid and investment to those African nations that respect human rights. His country is often hailed as one of the most democratic nations on the continent.
Mr. Mbeki has occasionally offered criticism of Zimbabwe, but he and his officials have expressed a clear preference for what they call "quiet diplomacy," which means criticism in private and cordial cooperation in public. 
South Africa hailed Zimbabwe's presidential election in March as legitimate, even though officials eliminated polling stations in opposition strongholds, and the police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of people who were waiting to vote.
Earlier this month, foreign ministers in the region rejected efforts by the European Union to condemn Zimbabwe, although they did agree to a statement that calls for food to be distributed fairly in the country. 
There is no doubt that South Africa has quietly prodded Mr. Mugabe, who is widely viewed as a proud and mercurial leader who responds poorly to public criticism. Zimbabwe is South Africa's largest regional trading partner.
Mr. Mugabe was a staunch supporter of the anti-apartheid struggle. Many African officials respect him for supporting the region's fight against white rule and for his efforts to redistribute land stolen by British settlers. That issue resonates in South Africa and Namibia, where whites control most of the land. 
Many African officials are also suspicious of all the Western talk about human rights in Zimbabwe when there is little talk about human rights in other African countries. 
"In other African countries where human rights are ignored, it's business as usual," said Claude Kabema, the acting director of the Electoral Institute of Southern Africa. "That's why many people have failed to embrace the Western position. They see it as hypocrisy."
Yet others here and abroad say it is hypocritical for South Africa, which fought so hard for its democracy, not to loudly condemn rights abuses on its doorstep.
"South Africa is not supportive," complained Peter Moyo, a spokesman for a group of black Zimbabweans living in South Africa. "Children are going to bed hungry and nobody seems to care," he said. "We need to hear from South Africa."

HEADLINE: For Students Seeking Edge, One Major Just Isn't Enough 

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
Having honed the habit of achievement in the race to get into college, students are increasingly pursuing double, triple and even quadruple majors when they get there, amassing credentials they hope will show their diligence and, perhaps, give them an edge getting into graduate school or landing a job in a difficult market. 
 Katherine Lochbrunner was one of the superachievers, graduating from Boston University last spring with a quadruple major, in Hispanic language and literature, art history, Latin and classical civilization. 
 "I just couldn't narrow it down to one field, " said Ms. Lochbrunner, who now teaches Latin at St. Peter's Preparatory School in Jersey City. "I thought I'd do Spanish, but then I discovered how much I liked art history. And I thought four majors would be good at the point when I was looking for a job." 
At Georgetown University, 23 percent of the 2002 graduates had double majors, compared with 14 percent of the class of 1996. At Washington University in St. Louis, 42 percent of last year's arts and science graduates had double majors or double degrees, compared with 28 percent of the 1997 graduates. 
Nearly a quarter of the students in the University of Wisconsin at Madison's graduating class have double majors. But that no longer counts for too much: About 160 students are getting triple majors or more, and even quintuple majors are not unheard of. 
Behind the trend, in part, is the fact that more freshmen now arrive on campus with extensive college credits from Advanced Placement exams, university summer school classes, or college courses they took in high school. 
But other factors are at play. 
For students who spent their high school years pursuing Advanced Placement credits, high test scores and prestigious extracurricular activities, the multiple major seems to be the Next Big Thing -- even for freshmen, and parents of freshmen. 
"All that pressure, all that push to give the child an edge, that you see around college admissions now continues into college, with many parents seeing the double major as the marker that this is a student doing all she can do," said Susan K. Jackson, senior associate dean at Boston University. "I was just at my son's parents weekend at Yale, at a faculty panel, where one parent went to the open mike and asked, in anguished tones, whether her daughter should be doing a double major. What she seemed to be saying was, 'Is that the most ambitious thing? Is that what will give her the edge?' "
The faltering economy, with its dim job prospects for new graduates, plays a role, too. 
"I think students are increasingly aware that they might have more than one career, that they might need expertise in a variety of areas," said Carol Christ, the president of Smith College. "They have a very savvy eye out to what's going to pay the rent." 
Many educators are dubious that multiple majors do students much good once they leave college. 
"My suspicion is that they're more valuable to the seller than the buyer," said Mark Schenker, Yale College's dean of academic affairs. 
Still, multiple majors believe they should be especially marketable.
"I'm hedging my bets," said Elisabeth Thompson, who is majoring in mathematics, Spanish and computer science at Madison. "The more fields I am prepared or qualified to work in, the less I have to worry about problems in any given industry," Ms. Thompson said.
Cheryl Biel, George Washington University's director of academic planning and assessment, said this generation is trying hard to cover all the bases: "These are the same kids trying to get all the internships. It may be a kid doing pre-med, but they want an interesting nonscience major that will show they're a broad person, and give them an edge for med school." 
But administrators at some schools worry that meeting all the departmental requirements stops multiple majors from sampling a broad liberal arts education. 
Then, too, some college officials doubt that double majors confer any real benefit in graduate school admissions or the job market. Some advise students to use extra credits to graduate early and get a master's degree, rather than taking five years to complete three or four undergraduate majors, as many want to do. 
Still, many schools are seeing a steady rise in double majors. The increase has been especially striking at George Washington University, which has 486 double majors this fall, compared with 70 a decade earlier.
The trend is less evident at the most selective institutions, including those in the Ivy League, where the use of Advanced Placement credits is increasingly restricted. 
But at many schools, the lure of multiple majors has become so strong, administrators say, that some freshmen announce their intent to double major even before they have chosen a single area of interest. "We get a lot of freshmen who come in saying they definitely want a double major, but when we ask in what, they have no idea what they want to study," said Timothy Walsh, director of Wisconsin's Cross-College Advising Service. "They just think they have to double major to look serious."
At Wisconsin, many of the multiple majors stick to related fields: combinations like physics, astrophysics, math and computer science, or zoology, biology and environmental studies are common. 
That seems to be less true at small liberal arts colleges, though. At Colorado College, for example, where double majors won formal recognition only five years ago, most are used to following far-flung interests. 
"Most of our double majors have one major in the area where they think their professional specialty will be and another that reflects a very different interest, like a pre-med biology major who's also majoring in French," said Timothy Fuller, a political science professor who was dean when the Colorado College faculty approved double majors. 
Occasionally, combinations represent a compromise: where the mother is pushing for law school, for example, and the son wants to pursue ethnomusicology, a "one for me, one for Mom" double major in political science and music can keep the whole family happy. 
Dustin Harber arrived in Madison last year as a freshman expecting to double major in computer science and Japanese. But already, in his second year, he's doubled again, and now plans a quadruple major in computer science, Japanese, math and Asian studies. 
"I knew I could fit in several majors because I got here with A.P. credits in calculus, English lit, English language, computer science, U.S. history, government and something else I must be forgetting," he said. "Then I got a lot of credits for all the Japanese courses I placed out of."
Mr. Harber, who also holds two part-time jobs, does not go around bragging about his quadruple major. 
"I usually tell people I'm doing three, because if I say I'm doing four majors, they call me a psycho and think I'm this big overachiever trying to make myself look better," he said. "But I'm just a regular student, trying to get everything I can out of college. I am planning to go to grad school in computer science, which is pretty competitive, and if they see I have computer science and math, and this other interest too, I hope they'll think, 'Hey, this candidate is well rounded.' " 
For many students like Mr. Harber, who managed a tough course load and many activities in high school, hard work seems normal, while the idea of slacking off, or using all those credits to graduate early, holds little interest. 
Corey Chapman, a UCLA senior majoring in English and history, said the drive of the incoming freshmen was striking last summer, when he was one of the university's orientation counselors, assigned to answer freshmen questions, some of which concerned multiple majors. 
"I think they feel like they still have to be complete overachievers," Mr. Chapman said. "It was like they just had to do more. They asked when you can declare a double major and which A.P. credits would apply. I had to tell them the rules changed since I got here, and you can't use those credits to fill requirements as much anymore. And I tried to say that their A.P.'s had helped them get into UCLA, but now that they're here they should try to have some fun and explore new ideas." 
While students are showing growing interest in multiple majors, there is still considerable debate in academia about whether that is good or bad. A few colleges are resisting the trend to multiple majors, seeking, instead, to help undergraduates experience the broadest possible liberal arts education. 
"We think you miss out if you focus on one or two areas," said Ellen Guyer, dean of academic programs at Macalester College in Minnesota. "One reason you come to a liberal arts college is to take courses in areas you never even heard of, intriguing courses that broaden your world view and expose you to new ideas. About a third of the students in our last graduating class had double majors, but we're trying to discourage it. Some students feel it makes them more marketable, that if you add up credentials, more is better. Whether that has any validity after college is anybody's guess."

HEADLINE: From Middle Class to the Shelter Door; 
In a Trend, New Yorkers Face Poverty After Last Unemployment Check

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
The tidy apartment in a house in Staten Island rents for just $650 a month, but Salvatore and Lorraine Nardulli can no longer afford it. They cannot pay the phone bill, or the electric bill, or the insurance on their 10-year-old Pontiac Grand Prix. There is an empty space next to the VCR where the cable box once stood; dunning letters are stacked up on the kitchen table.
 Mr. Nardulli, 53, who worked for an airline for almost three decades, has been unemployed for 18 months and cannot find a full-time job. Mrs. Nardulli, who is several years younger, worked for years as a legal secretary but more recently has been a homemaker and student; she cannot find any work. 
 They have run through their $12,000 or so in savings. They have borrowed to the limit on their credit cards, another $12,000. And in June, Mr. Nardulli's extended unemployment insurance ran out. 
Turned down twice for public assistance, the Nardullis say they fear that they will end up in a homeless shelter. "If we have to leave this apartment -- God forbid," Mrs. Nardulli said. "I feel like we are being punished because my husband lost his job."
No one knows for sure how many people are in the same boat as the Nardullis: people whose comfortable lives have abruptly unraveled because of the recession and the economic aftereffects of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Some economists say there may be hundreds of thousands of them across the country, based on trends in the labor market and in unemployment insurance, which has traditionally been a safety net of the middle class, as public assistance has been for the poor.
The percentage of people who have exhausted their regular unemployment benefits is at the highest level in two decades. In New York State, 156,000 people have also used up the additional three months of temporary unemployment benefits that Congress authorized in March; that program expires at the end of December.
While New York has by far the largest number of people who have run out of temporary benefits, nationally there are about 1.5 million, according to the federal Department of Labor. Wendell Primus, director of the income security division of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research institute in Washington, estimates that up to a million of them have not found jobs and are not eligible for more aid.
Of course, even among those who have not found work, not everyone is necessarily experiencing as much hardship as the Nardullis. Many may have had more savings, and about 40 percent are likely to have had working spouses, according to studies done in previous years for the Labor Department by Mathematica Policy Research. 
What clearly makes the Nardullis unusual is their willingness to talk about their plight. Some New Yorkers in similar straits have said they were too embarrassed or ashamed (or worried what their landlords would think) to let their names be used publicly. 
Mr. and Mrs. Nardulli struggled with the idea of discussing their situation but said they finally decided that their story might help other people by drawing attention to the problems of the unemployed.
Besides, Mr. Nardulli said: "We've got nothing to lose. We're going down anyway. I used to be optimistic, but now that's all gone."
Such gloomy sentiments are new for a couple who describe themselves as "life of the party" types who love to dance. They met in 1977, at a disco in Brooklyn, where they lived until three years ago. "We were 'Saturday Night Fever' fans," Mrs. Nardulli said.
In those days, Mr. Nardulli's job seemed not just secure, but glamorous, he said. The travel benefits at the big international airline where he was a cargo agent meant that he could go skiing in Switzerland, swimming in Caracas, "travel the world," he said. With overtime, he eventually made as much as $45,000 a year. And what member of the Teamsters union ever got laid off?
"I felt secure with him," Mrs. Nardulli said. They were married in 1981; Mr. Nardulli still carries two copies of their wedding photo in his wallet. And Mrs. Nardulli, the more voluble of the two, constantly sings the praises of her husband as "a good man" and "a good worker."
Neither of them has a college degree. "I couldn't afford it; I was supporting my family," said Mr. Nardulli, whose father died when he was 13. Mrs. Nardulli studied business for a year at Pace University and then worked for about a dozen years as a secretary. 
A few years after they were married, Mrs. Nardulli decided to stay home. "I thought I was going to have a baby, but I didn't," she said. It left her depressed.
Eventually, she began going to school. She studied to become a paralegal, got a real estate license and became a notary public. She did temporary work sometimes, but mostly she decorated her apartment and kept it spotless and enjoyed music and parties and friends, she said.
Both of them have regrets. "If I had known this could happen, I would have done things differently," Mrs. Nardulli said. "I would have made sure I got a job immediately."
As for Mr. Nardulli, he wishes that he had heeded the warning signs, in the late 1990's, that there was trouble at the airline (which he does not want identified because he still hopes to get a pension). But his department was shuttered in 1998. "I worked for 28 years straight and I have nothing to show for it," he said. 
He did get a severance package, but that was used up quickly as he hunted for a new job, and in the course of their move to Staten Island. (Brooklyn had become too expensive.)
After a short stint running the shipping department of a small factory, Mr. Nardulli got a job at a customs clearing concern, where he worked until April 2001. But as the economy slowed, the owner decided to downsize, and to move what was left of the company to New Jersey. Mr. Nardulli got two weeks' pay. 
What kept them afloat after that was the $362 a week Mr. Nardulli got in unemployment benefits. He ran out of benefits before Thanksgiving last year, and used a credit card for living expenses until he became eligible for three more months in the spring under the emergency unemployment program.
He has diligently looked for a job, and has inches of faxed resumes to prove it. "I had a chance before Sept. 11," he said. But since then, the steep decline in travel and shipping has spawned huge cutbacks at New York's airports. Airport-related jobs have plunged by almost 16.5 percent, or about 10,000, according to the Center for an Urban Future, a nonpartisan research group.
Mr. Nardulli has tried looking in other industries but has been told that there are hiring freezes or that he lacks the right job history, he said. "I went to a supermarket and the guy said, 'With your qualifications, why?' I said, 'I need a job.' But he refused me because I had no experience." 
Mrs. Nardulli said she had been rejected for jobs because her experience was not a perfect match for, say, a doctor's office, rather than a lawyer's office. Temporary agencies tell her that nothing is available. Both she and Mr. Nardulli are getting computer training, courtesy of the State Labor Department, but she said their school was not holding out much hope of finding them work.
If they could both find even low-paying jobs, Mrs. Nardulli said, "with steady paychecks, we could pool them and make it."
More than that, Mr. Nardulli said, "I want a job that pays the rent."
In desperation, the Nardullis turned to public assistance, an experience that they said was humiliating and ultimately pointless.
Here, too, they seem to be illustrative of a trend.
Welfare rolls have not increased consistently this year, but there have been sharp increases in applications for public assistance since June, according to the New York City Human Resources Administration. The number of people in the city not on public assistance but getting food stamps, which some analysts say is a better measure of economic hardship, has risen by more than 60,000 in the last year, an increase of almost 17 percent.
The Nardullis, after going through all kinds of examinations and investigations and skills tests, got a two-month supply of food stamps, and Mr. Nardulli was promised a job as a security guard. He said he worked only three days, bringing home just $100. But according to the paperwork, he was making $2,000 a month at that job, so he was refused any further assistance.
Through a friend, Mr. Nardulli then found a part-time job driving a van for disabled people. He enjoys the work, likes the passengers and wants to succeed so much that he has spent hours memorizing city street maps.
But as the employee with the least seniority, he works only three days a week, usually bringing home $150 a week after taxes. He has started spending his days off doing yardwork and anything else he can, but it is not enough to pay the rent and utilities, much less buy food.
Still, it is enough to disqualify him for public assistance. As a letter the Nardullis got from the city put it (complete with misspellings), his "income is suffican to meet the budgetory needof your family unit."
Mr. Nardulli's translation: "You have to lose everything before you get help."
The Nardullis have not yet lost everything, not quite. There's still the green Pontiac, which flies an American flag. Though it broke down recently, a cousin of Mrs. Nardulli's gave them the money to repair it and to pay for the insurance.
And they are still in the apartment, though they are two months behind on the rent. "The landlords are very nice, very nice people," Mrs. Nardulli said. "But, of course, they would like their money."
If worse comes to worst, Mrs. Nardulli said, she will get a lot of bubble wrap and pack up all the treasures she has accumulated during her marriage: all the silk flowers and Precious Moments figurines, all the apple-themed kitchen gear and the framed maxim, "When there is love in the house, there is joy in the heart."
She has already asked friends whether they will store her things if she ends up in a homeless shelter.
"They think we're kidding," Mr. Nardulli said. "But we're just realistic."

HEADLINE: More Trouble in Chinatown As Job-Training Effort Fails 

BYLINE:  By DAISY HERNANDEZ 

 BODY:
The organization that provides most of the nonprofit job training in Chinatown has eliminated its program for dislocated workers, causing worries in a community still reeling from a battered economy and the aftershocks of the Sept. 11 attack.
 The organization, Chinatown Manpower Project, sent a letter to the New York City Department of Employment in September, saying it would not continue its four-year contract with the city because it could not meet its performance goals. The contract was worth $355,446 annually, but the organization received full payment only after it found jobs for workers. The program was the only one using money from the city's Department of Employment and directed at dislocated workers who are Chinese-American. 
 A department spokesman, George Rodriguez, said the city had been pleased with the program, which in its last cycle had about 20 students pass the state exam to become certified nursing aides. But he said the department could not do much in response to the cancellation.
"We can't force them to take the contract," Mr. Rodriguez said.
Many of the students were former garment-industry workers. The 12-week program was successful among those who graduated and found jobs at nursing homes, where the demand for bilingual aides has grown in recent years with an increase in elderly Chinese patients.
The Chinatown Manpower Project has been a fixture for 30 years. It runs a dozen programs, including job training and literacy classes.
The organization's longtime executive director, Sue Lee, left earlier this year and was replaced on Nov. 4 by James Melendez. When asked about the dislocated-workers program, Mr. Melendez said he did not know about past decisions affecting it. He added, however, that he had reviewed the group's other training programs and that "all those programs are doing very well."
But David Fischer, project director at the Center for an Urban Future, said nonprofit organizations have had a difficult time operating dislocated-worker programs because government funding for job training is tied to performance and worker placement has become more difficult since the attack.
David Chen, executive director of the Chinese-American Planning Council, agreed, saying that his organization has had to "do more with less."
"But what if you already do more with less?" he said.
Mr. Chen said his group, like others, finances job training with the hope that it will later receive government funding.
Instead of eliminating job training, Mr. Chen said, his group has cut back on the hours it is open for walk-in services, when Chinatown residents often seek help with everything from language translation to employment problems. And the organization has had to consider what was once the unthinkable: charging people for some services.
Despite the closing of the Chinatown Manpower Project's dislocated-workers program, training continued for the 21 students who had already registered for the nursing-aide course. One student, Walter Tang, said classes had been delayed twice, but were finally begun at the end of October. When he heard that the program had been dismantled, he was alarmed.
"We want to keep the program running," Mr. Tang said. "We want to get jobs."
Mr. Tang said he had been unemployed since January and that he had applied for airport and Postal Service jobs. But he said he had not been called back for interviews and that he was especially worried because his unemployment benefits end in February.
"We have to get training as soon as possible," he said.
Since the closing of the Chinatown Manpower Project, the Chinese-American Planning Council has been inundated with workers seeking help, said its project director for employment and training, Jeffrey F. Chen.
"You have a waiting list of hundreds of people," he said. "It's almost like a desperate situation." 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 20, 2002

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about the closing of a job training program for dislocated workers at a New York nonprofit organization, the Chinatown Manpower Project, referred incorrectly at one point to the organization's status. It remains open; it did not close with the training program.

HEADLINE: Survey Shows 27 Presidents Of Colleges Top $500,000 

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Although academia is not traditionally known for high salaries, 27 private college presidents earned more than $500,000 last year, a survey by The Chronicle of Higher Education shows. 
 The survey of 595 private colleges found that the median pay for the presidents of research universities increased 30 percent from the 1997 fiscal year to the 2001 fiscal year. In contrast, the pay for presidents of liberal arts colleges grew by 4 percent in that period. 
 Still, the survey found, it was a liberal arts college president who topped last year's chart: Claire L. Gaudiani, the Connecticut College president who resigned under pressure from the faculty, with a half-million-dollar severance package that brought her total compensation to $898,410. 
Ms. Gaudiani's compensation included her pay and benefits, $346,000, plus the $551,500 severance. Trish Brink, a spokeswoman for the college, said the severance reflected the contributions Ms. Gaudiani had made in 13 years as president. 
"President Gaudiani had a long tenure here at the college, during which time significant advancements were made, including the establishment of five academic centers in international studies, arts and technology, environmental studies, museum studies and community action," Ms. Brink said. 
Ms. Gaudiani's severance package is far greater than that of some more prominent college presidents who stepped down last year. 
Harold T. Shapiro, who ranked third in the survey, received $705,863 in the year he stepped down as president of Princeton, including deferred compensation estimated at $200,000. Ruth J. Simmons received about $145,000 in deferred compensation when she left Smith College to become Brown University's president, bringing her total compensation from Smith for that year to $539,169. Robert Edwards, who left as president of Bowdoin College, received $217,250 in severance pay, bringing his 2001 compensation to $591,000.
No. 2 on the compensation list -- and the highest paid of presidents staying in place -- was Judith Rodin, who received $808,021 last year at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Others on the Top 10 list are William R. Brody of Johns Hopkins, at $677,564; L. Jay Oliva, the former president of New York University, at $651,000; Constantine N. Papadakis of Drexel, at $637,839; Richard C. Levin of Yale, at $612,453; Steven B. Sample of the University of Southern California, at $605,086; H. Patrick Swygert of Howard University, at $603,031; and Jon Westling of Boston University, at $591,017. 
College presidents are by no means the highest-paid people in academia: many medical-school professors and others earn more than the presidents of their universities. At Vanderbilt University, for example, the highest paid official was William T. Spitz, the vice chancellor for investments, who earned $3,217,311. 
But college presidents' pay is growing far more rapidly than professors'. At Penn and Princeton, where faculty pay rose 4.8 percent from 2000 to 2001, the president's pay went up by 16 percent and 43 percent, respectively. 
Competition for the top recruits has never been fiercer, with public and private universities increasingly vying for the same candidates. Compensation for those who lead large state university systems, too, has escalated, so that Texas and Tennessee now top $700,000. 
Patrick M. Callan, president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, said the rising pay for college presidents poses dangers to higher education. 
"As the president's pay goes up, it raises what you pay the provosts, the deans, and so on, and that cost escalation, at a time of recession when we're going to have to raise tuition anyway, sends a pretty insensitive message," Mr. Callan said.

HEADLINE: Where the Powerful and Famous Nosh; 
A Haven for Politicians

BYLINE:  By LISA FODERARO 

 BODY:
 FOOD isn't the only reason to go out to a restaurant, and you don't have to go in to Manhattan to mingle with a glitzy crowd. Westchester and nearby counties are rife with its own celebrities -- actors and rock musicians, artists and classical performers, and of course, a full cast of politicos. 
 Here is a handful of restaurants that for whatever reason -- the menu, the atmosphere, the space between the tables -- have become regular haunts of the see-and-be-seen crowds.
On the outside, Mulino's of Westchester does not make a punchy first impression, hidden as it is on a side street in downtown White Plains behind a nondescript brick facade.
But inside, the space is bright and elegant, and it becomes instantly clear why the restaurant is the preferred dining place in Westchester for powerful politicians and business leaders.
Sparkling, jewel-toned bottles of Italian brandy, or grappa, fill mirrored shelves in the small bar area. In the dining room, tables draped in white linen offer an unexpected view through a wall of windows: a manmade waterfall in the courtyard. Diners are welcomed by solicitous waiters bearing platters of Parmesan cheese, bruschetta and marinated zucchini.
No wonder the restaurant's reservation book is filled with so many high-profile names. Regulars from the business world include Nicholas M. Donofrio, senior vice president for technology and manufacturing of I.B.M.; Barry I. Slotnick, the defense lawyer; and Louis R. Cappelli, the county's uber-builder.
Among the many elected officials who frequent Mulino's are Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive; Nicholas A. Spano, a New York State senator (who is no relation to the county executive), along with his brother, Michael J. Spano, a state assemblyman, and their father, Leonard N. Spano, the county clerk; Joseph M. Delfino, the White Plains mayor; and Janet DiFiore, a state Supreme Court justice-elect.
"It is the 'in' place for everybody, but especially for politicians," said Vincent Natrella, former chairman of the county's Conservative Committee. "If you're going to speak to somebody, like a senator or assemblyman or mayor, nobody bothers you. You're treated very respectfully."
Gov. George E. Pataki dines at Mulino's with local politicians a couple of times a year. Even two former New York City mayors, Edward I. Koch and Rudolph W. Giuliani, have made their way to White Plains for the restaurant's Northern Italian cooking.
Part of the restaurant's success, apart from the fresh, flavorful food (a full meal costs about $50 a person), is because of its attention to detail. Marcello Giansante, the smooth-as-Sambuca manager, commits his customers' likes and dislikes to memory.
Favorite tables? Mr. Giansante said Mr. Natrella likes to sit right up front by the entrance "so he doesn't have to walk too far to shake hands," while the Spanos prefer the upper dining level. Salvatore J. Carrera, Westchester's director of economic development and real estate, is happiest at a corner table by the window.
Most of the politicians forgo a cocktail in favor of a good red wine, whether a Brunello from Italy or a cabernet sauvignon from California. One important customer, Brenda Spano, wife of the county executive, is highly allergic to a particular nut. "We make sure that none of the specials have any nuts at all" when she comes for dinner, Mr. Giansante said.
For Mr. Carrera, who came to county government after 30 years in the high-powered world of Manhattan real estate, Mulino's helped smooth the transition to Westchester. "I always enjoyed a good lunch or dinner at a classy four-star restaurant, and that's what I find at Mulino's," he said. LISA FODERARO

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Hampton's Destination Appears to Be Atlanta

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
In a stunning development to what was initially a two-team, six-player trade, pitcher Mike Hampton was on his way to the Atlanta Braves last night.
 Neither the Colorado Rockies, who began the sequence by trading Hampton to Florida, nor the Marlins confirmed the development, but a person familiar with the trade talks said the Marlins were talking to the Braves and were expected to complete a deal for the left-handed Hampton. 
 "Hampton will never pitch for the Marlins," the person said. 
The turn of events came on a day when Hampton and Marlins catcher Charles Johnson had to waive the no-trade provisions in their contracts for the two teams to complete their trade. Johnson did not waive his no-trade clause by the 2 p.m. deadline, but Scott Boras, his agent, said later in the day that Johnson agreed to accept the trade once the Marlins agreed to pay him $1 million to offset Colorado's state income tax.
Hampton, according to the person familiar with the trade talks, initially said he would not waive his no-trade clause to go to the Marlins, but would waive it if the Marlins traded him to a team that had a chance to contend.
Mark Rodgers, Hampton's agent, disputed that characterization, saying Hampton had waived the provision earlier in the day before the deadline.
The pending acquisition of Hampton, who was a disappointment in two years with the Rockies, was expected to have an impact on the Braves' plans for their two free-agent starters, Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux.
The Braves have not made a strong effort to re-sign either one, and now that they appear to be on the verge of acquiring Hampton, they may let Glavine and Maddux go elsewhere.
It is still possible, however, that the Braves could re-sign one of the pitchers.
The Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies have been the two most aggressive pursuers of Glavine, a left-hander, both making him three-year offers. No team has publicly acknowledged going after Maddux.
Hampton, whose eight-year, $121 million contract is the richest ever signed by a pitcher, wants to leave Colorado after two seasons in which he struggled with a 21-28 record and a 5.75 earned run average. 
The struggling Marlins were not what he had in mind, but the Braves, with their 11 consecutive division championships, certainly appeal to him.
When the Rockies and the Marlins agreed to their trade last Wednesday, contingent on the acceptance by Hampton and Johnson, the Rockies agreed to send Hampton and center fielder Juan Pierre to Florida for Johnson, center fielder Preston Wilson, reliever Vic Darensbourg and infielder Pablo Ozuna.
The Hampton trade was to be the first step in a three-pronged plan to create payroll flexibility for the Rockies. 
They are also talking to the Mets about trading pitcher Denny Neagle for shortstop Rey Ordonez and outfielder Jeromy Burnitz, and to the Arizona Diamondbacks about trading them outfielder Larry Walker.
The Rockies and the Marlins wanted to make the deal for economic reasons. The Rockies wanted to shed the remaining six years and $84.5 million on Hampton's contract, while the Marlins wanted to reduce their financial obligations in the immediate future.
The Marlins not only would get rid of the last three years of Johnson's and Wilson's contracts, but they would also not have to pay Hampton. It was not known whom the Marlins would get from the Braves, but they were not expected to be high-priced players.

BYLINE:  By Philip Shenon 

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
There are several variations of a grim joke told in this city's beleaguered tourism industry. And most of them end with the same biblically inspired punch line: "So when do the locusts arrive?"
 Over the last 15 months, it has been one blow after another for hotels, restaurants and tourist attractions in the nation's capital. First the tourism industry struggled with the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. Then the city was panicked by the deadly anthrax mailings, which shut down Congress and convinced already wary travelers that they were wise to stay away. 
 And just when things were looking up this autumn and tourists had begun to return to Washington in siable numbers, the city and its suburbs were terrorized by a series of sniper attacks that left 10 people dead.
 The capture last month of two men accused of the sniper murders has brought a sense of relief to the capital, but the arrests may have been too late to salvage the city's autumn tourism season.
 "We really haven't done an economic tabulation of the damage," said William A. Hanbury, president of the Washington D. C. Conventiona nd Tourism Corporation, the capital's tourism bureau. "But there absolutely was an effect. You can't deny it."
 While no major conventions were canceled, he said, there were many cancellations among the large school and youth groups that usually flood into the city after the opening of the academic year. The city's restaurant industry was devastated as Washingtons chose to stay home rather than risk a sniper encounter.
 Before the sniper attacks hotel reservations were nearly back to pre-Sept. 11 levels, thanks in part to uninterrupted business from the federal government and its contractors. Occupancy rates had been about 80 percent, close to normal for the fall season. (In the first weeks after Sept. 11, almost three out of four hotel rooms in the city went empty.) Over the summer, rates had been down about 5 percent from the year before, according to figures from the city's tourism agency.
 The sniper attacks put an abrupt end to this rebound. Now, hotel managers and restaurateurs say they will try to make up for lost time before the holiday season.
 Perhaps no one in the travel industry has more reason to be relieved by the sniper arrests than Jorge E. Trevito, the director of hotel openings for Kimpton Hotels, the San Francisco-based chain with the bad timing to have opened five new boutique hotels in Washington since last fall.
 "It has been a tough time," said Mr. Trevino, who is also the general manager of the Hotel Monaco, which may be the most talked-about new hotel in Washington, given its flamboyant interior decor in this decidedly button-down city. He said that while the sniper attacks had "not caused a blizzard of cancellations, we did see a slower pace of bookings."
 The tough times have brought bargain rates at many of the city's best hotels.
 The 184-room Hotel Monaco, one of 37 boutique hotels managed by Kimpton around the country is offering an introductory weekend rate of $169 a night for a double room on its Web site (www.monaco-dc.com), more than half off the regular rate of $350. (Those rates are before taxes, which add 14.5 percent to all hotel bills in the city.)
 Most of the major government attractions that were shut down after Sept. 11 and the anthrax mailings have since been reopened to visitors, including the Capitol and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The Washington Monument was reopened in February after a $10.5 million renovation that was under way at the time of the terrorist attacks.
 The White House, the Pentagon and F.B.I. headquarters have resumed public tours, although on a limited basis because of security concerns. The White House generally accepts only school and military groups for tours, and only those with advance reservations.
 To entice visitors back to the capital, the Convention and Tourism Corporation has mounted a $2.5 million advertising campaign that features stars of the television drama "West Wing" urging patriotic visitors to "come, be inspired" by the capital. A separate television and features the first lady, Laura Bush, Senator John McCain and the soccer star Mia Hamm joining in a rendition of the Gershwin classic "Of Thee I Sing."
 The travel bureau is also promoting a series of new events and exhibitions around the city, including a display of Julia Child's reconstructed kitchen at the National Museum of American History to mark her 90th birthday; a new 3-D Imax movie at the National Air and Space Museum featuring the journeys of the Space Shuttle; and the new International Spy Museum, which has proved a hit with its interactive displays on the history of espionage.

PINOCCHIO THE BOY
Or, Incognito in Collodi.
Written and illustrated by Lane Smith.
Unpaged. New York:
Viking. $16.99. (Ages 5 and up)
 GepPetto wasn't looking for a son. The puppet he made was meant to be his meal ticket. He had planned to take it all over the world, make it dance and do flips, and in that way earn his "crust of bread and glass of wine." As Geppetto carved his puppet, however, it sprang to life, then kicked Geppetto on the nose and tore off down the street. 
If Pinocchio had known what lay in store for him, how he would be adapted, abridged and reimagined (four new versions just now), he would have kept on running, jumped right out of the book and fled his Destiny, which was that he would become a literary superstar and everyone would want a piece of him. 
Carlo Collodi was the pen name of Carlo Lorenzini, a political journalist who never married and lived with his mother. He began "Pinocchio," his first bit of "childishness" as he called it, in 1881, when he was in his 50's. The story appeared in installments in a children's magazine over the course of two years. In 1883, it was published as a novel and was an immediate sensation in Italy, but Collodi, who never had any money, did not share in the book's financial success and died without knowing that there would one day be hundreds of translations of his book in more than 100 languages. 
"Pinocchio" is a rich mix of fairy tale, commedia dell'arte, fable, picaresque, quest, realism and bildungsroman. It has been interpreted, analyzed and dissected in ways literary, religious, political, economic and psychoanalytic. It is able to be all things to all people because Pinocchio is Everyman, and his struggle to be "real" is a captivating, timeless metaphor for the human condition. 
"Pinocchio" holds mythic status in Italy, where it is widely considered a masterpiece equal to "The Divine Comedy." International scholars admire it, too, favorably comparing it to the "Odyssey," the "Aeneid," "The Pilgrim's Progress" and "Huckleberry Finn." Considering its reputation, comparatively few people know it. 
I've done an informal survey, asking my literate friends if they've read the book, and while most assume they have, when questioned they turn out to know only Disney's charming 1940 adaptation, which, though scary at times, brightens and softens Collodi's story and simplifies and sentimentalizes his puppet, making Pinocchio trusting and adorable. They're unaware that the original puppet had rougher edges, was egocentric, obstinate and rash, yet also self-sacrificing, generous and passionate -- in short, Italian. 
Likewise, they're shocked to hear that Collodi's Pinocchio hurls a hammer at the moralizing Cricket, squashing it flat, or that the Blue Fairy first appears as a little girl who is dead and tells Pinocchio she is waiting to be taken away in a casket.
Great stuff!
One hundred and twenty years later, "Pinocchio" continues to be remade, revamped and retold; Roberto Benigni stars as the puppet in a new movie opening on Christmas Day. Yet the original Pinocchio refuses to die. Even Collodi couldn't kill him, though he tried: he intended to end the story with Chapter 15, when the puppet is hanged from a tree by the Fox and the Cat and left for dead, but such was the hue and cry from the writer's young audience that he brought Pinocchio back to life. 
There have been hundreds (if not thousands) of versions of "Pinocchio" in English, from board books to pop-ups to lavish full-color volumes. The boy puppet has been rendered by illustrators in countless guises, everything from Little Lord Fauntleroy Pinocchios to Charlie McCarthy look-alikes. On the whole, though, Pinocchio has been lucky in his illustrators, the most brilliant of whom was Atillio Mussino, whose marvelous illustrations are now out of print. Successful depictions of the character always give Pinocchio a puppet's hinged arms and legs but a head more human than mechanical. This is critical because Pinocchio, while certainly a puppet, is really a boy, and a boy with outsized emotions at that.
This season, different artists give us their Pinocchios, with mixed results. 
Gris Grimly's black-and-white drawings capture something of the tale's manic pace, but his Pinocchio is all puppet. He's rough-hewn, a folk art doll, and it's hard to feel the human drama Pinocchio suffers. Grimly, who illustrated "Monster Museum," sets "Pinocchio" not so much in 19th-century Tuscany as in his own wacky world, which is part Gothic, part Mad magazine, a place with crooked telephone poles and characters who resemble aliens. 
I loved Iassen Ghiuselev's magnificent full-color paintings and drawings in his jaw-droppingly beautiful oversized edition, but they're too somber for "Pinocchio." They lack the commedia dell'arte spirit that lightens the story's horrific events. Moreover, his puppet is no devilish scamp but a heavy, almost tragic figure; even Pinocchio's smiles are melancholy.
The prose in the Ghiuselev book is more fluent than that in the Grimly, though no translator is cited in either. Collodi wrote in a 19th-century Tuscan dialect that I'm told is sinewy and beautiful, but the English in children's editions has always been choppy and awkward. Thank goodness for Nancy Canepa, who at last gives us a "Pinocchio" written in graceful and lively English prose. This paperback seems aimed at adults, but there's no reason not to give it to a child. It's the least expensive of the bunch, and children can skip the introduction and ignore Carmelo Lettere's sketchy and uneven drawings, which are sometimes suggestive and sometimes confusing and probably won't appeal to kids.
In every edition of "Pinocchio," the least satisfying illustration is the last one, when the puppet turns into a boy. Somehow he always looks less real, less believable, than he did as a puppet. Collodi understood the problem, and ended the story immediately after the transformation. Where's the fun in reading about a good and obedient child?
Lane Smith, counterintuitively, chooses that very moment as the starting point for "Pinocchio the Boy," which he wrote and illustrated. Smith, who illustrated Jon Scieszka's stories "The True Story of the Three Little Pigs" and "The Stinky Cheese Man," is no stranger to wiseacre books poking fun at classic children's tales. This fits in that category. The illustrations and design are characteristically brilliant; they're appealing, original and amusing. If only his story were up to that level.
Smith's characters are banal and his plot is an embarrassment, so trivial I can't bring myself to describe it, except to say that his real boy Pinocchio goes out into the world and runs into trouble ludicrously mild compared to the agonies undergone by Collodi's Pinocchio, who was robbed, hanged, jailed, turned into a donkey, floured and almost fried, and swallowed by a shark. 
Oh, what a falling off was there! That the great Pinocchio should end up such a cipher! In this age of beautifully illustrated books, story has suffered terribly, and our picture books are all too often like the meal the Snail brings to a starving Pinocchio -- delicious seeming but made of plaster.

Bargain Shops Invade Upscale Streets

BYLINE:  By Terry Pristin

 BODY:
In 1999, a company called Wolf Camera spent about $1.6 million building a lavish new store on Manhattan's Upper East Side with custom wood and metal finishes. But the company went bankrupt and closed its store on 86th Street, between Park and Lexington Avenues, after less than two years.
 Wolf's blue carpeting with its curvy pattern (chosen to subtly suggest unspooling film) has outlasted the camera store but is now almost entirely obscured by racks of steeply discounted designer clothing crammed into a cluttered new store called Luxury Brand Outlet. 
 With its hand-lettered paper sign plastered across the stainless steel store entrance, Luxury Brand Outlet is hardly the kind of tenant usually found in the area. The window display consists of a haphazard arrangement of Ferragamo shoes peeking out of their boxes. Inexpensive icicle lights are strung across the ceiling. 
 But in spite of its desheveled appearance, Luxury Brand Outlet has something that Wolf Camera Lacked: plenty of customers.
 Discount stores have long flourished on Orchard and Canal Streets, and in other parts of the city as well. But in these troubled economic times, they are also popping up more and more frequently in more affluent shopping districts. Odd-Job, a chain describing itself as "closeouts with class" that sells everything from toys to toolboxes, has a store on East 60th Street, opposite Bloomingdale's. Home Brands Warehouse, a bustling housewares store that would never be mistaken for Gracious Home, has replaced a sleepy stationery shop that was on Third Avenue and 81st Street for many years.
 Luxury Brand Outlet will have to give up its 86th Street space next year when a Gristede's supermarket moves in. But Richard Dweck, the clothing store's owner, has opened three permanent stores since August 2001 - two of them also on the Upper East Side and one on Broadway and 93rd Street - and plans to open as many as six more in the city before too long. Off-price stores carry surplus goods bought very cheaply, often with cash on the spot, from manuacturers or other merchants, including department stores.
 Though many retailers have cut back on inventory in anticipation of slower sales, Mr Dweck said he had no difficulty finding merchandise. "Every day I get called," he said. "The department stores are getting killed. They are buying a little thinner, but there's still tons of stuff on the market."
 Even consumers with money to spend tend to be value-conscious and in search of new shopping experiences, according to industry experts. "At the moment, traditional retail outlets are not doing anything that really intrigues the shopper," said Wendy Liebmann, the president of WSL Strategic retail.
 This may explain why Mr. Dweck attracts a range of customers, including regulars like Wendy Brewer, an investment banker who lives on the Uppder East Side and gets a kick from ferreting out a good buy. "It's treasure hunting," Ms. Brewer said as she combed through a rack of evening gowns. She was wearing a pair of $695 Theory leather pants she picked up at the store for $100 but said her prize find was a taupe Armani jacket reduced from $2,095 to $299.
 Of course, shoppers know that department store merchandise will eventually go on sale - these days, sooner rather than later - and yet many do not want to put up with even a short delay, said Burt Flickinger III, the managing director of Reach Management, a retail consulting company. "Customers have neither the time or the patience to wait for markdowns and keep having to go back again, rather than get it cheap the first time," he said.
 Mr. Flickinger and others in the retail industry said they expected more off-price stores to open as national chains that over-expanded during the 1990's begin closing underperforming stores.
 Many landlords turn up their noses at off-price tenants. But others need the retail income, or simply prefer to fill a space with an unsightly store, at least temporarily, rather than leave it empty and risk creating the impression that the location is tainted. Steven B. Greenberg, the president of the Greenberg Group, a retail real estate consulting company, estimated that the retail vacancy rate in Manhattan was about 8 percent, about double the 1999 rate.
 "The better landlords - they're not going to cave in," Mr. Greenberg said. "But a mom-and-pop landlords, or a company sitting with a vacancy for nine months, they're going to take the tenant."

Election Lifts Market in Turkey

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE 

 BODY:
AN electoral landslide by a party known for its Islamist roots is an unlikely magnet for investment, but the triumph of the Justice and Development Party in Turkey has sent the country's stock market soaring. 
 Turkish shares rose by about 50 percent in the weeks immediately before and since national elections earlier this month as it became apparent that the Justice and Development Party would have a large parliamentary majority. That is a rare event in Turkey, and the stability it heralded pleased investors. 
 "It removes a political cloud and marks a pivotal shift for Turkey," said Ahmad Zuaiter, who manages the Turkish Investment Fund, a closed-end fund run by Morgan Stanley and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 
The Justice and Development Party has pledged to use its mandate to seek admission to the European Union as soon as possible and to pursue economic reforms sought by foreign creditors like the International Monetary Fund. The I.M.F. wants Turkey to cut government spending, revamp its banking industry and reduce farm subsidies.
Analysts who follow Turkish stocks for Merrill Lynch said the outlook for reform had brightened. In a report recommending an overweight position for Turkey in global portfolios, they argued that "the sheer scale of Justice and Development's majority bodes well for political stability and implementation of reforms" and that the party's "landslide does not represent a victory for political Islam."
Mr. Zuaiter is more circumspect, saying that Justice and Development "has a lot more to prove because it has a limited track record."
"It has also sent mixed signals in the last couple of months," he said.
Nevertheless, he described himself as "cautiously optimistic from a foreign-investment standpoint."
The Turkish stock market is extremely volatile, in large part because of large and sudden changes in inflation expectations and interest rates. It is common for yields on short-term debt to fluctuate by several percentage points in the course of a few weeks or even days. A sharp and swift rise in rates can make debt a more attractive investment option and spark an exodus from the stock market. When rates fall, as they have in the last couple of months, a flood of equity investment typically follows.
The Turkish Investment Fund is a convenient way for Americans to get broad, undiluted exposure to Turkey, although other funds have sizable holdings. T. Rowe Price Emerging Europe and Mediterranean, an open-end mutual fund, has 17 percent of its assets in Turkey. The closed-end Templeton Emerging Markets Fund has 5 percent there.
Mr. Zuaiter's fund rose 3.2 percent in the last 12 months, a period in which the Standard & Poor's 500 index lost more than one-fifth of its value. The fund's largest holdings include Akcansa Cimenti, which has activities in construction and building materials; the bank Akbank; Trakya Cam, a glass manufacturer; Koc Holdings, a conglomerate with interests in automobiles and consumer goods; and Turkcell, which provides two-thirds of Turkish wireless-phone service.
While most telecommunications stocks have performed poorly, Turkcell, traded on the New York Stock Exchange (it is the only Turkish stock with such a listing) was up 13.3 percent in the last 12 months.
The company "is very well managed," Mr. Zuaiter said, "with foreign strategic partners like Sonera," a Finnish telecommunications concern that controls nearly half the shares.
Turkcell "invested a significant amount of money early on, establishing dominance in the market," he said. "It has been pivotal in expanding mobile penetration," in part by luring away customers from Turkey's creaky state telephone system.
UBS Warburg is less enthusiastic and has a "hold" rating on Turkcell. Noting that its other major shareholder, Cukurova Group, controlled a bank that recently failed, Warburg's analysts say that the government may press Cukurova to sell its stake, depressing the stock.
Mr. Zuaiter said he owned Koc Holdings because it was "an entrenched brand name in Turkey and provides exposure to a number of facets of the economy." The Koc family owns a controlling interest in Migros, the country's largest retailer. Migros, which has its own listing, is the largest Turkish holding of the T. Rowe Price regional fund.
The Akbank investment is a bet on growth in Turkey's underdeveloped banking sector. Mr. Zuaiter said he liked the cement and glass companies "because we think there will be significant growth in construction activity, not just in Turkey but in the surrounding region."
HE was referring especially to Iraq, which accounted for 25 percent of Turkish trade before the Persian Gulf war. If there is another war, and if Iraq is defeated quickly, companies like Akcansa and Trakya would have a great deal to gain, he said. Iraq will have to be rebuilt, Mr. Zuaiter said, and he figures they will be among the Turkish companies winning work contracts.
As a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that borders Iraq, Turkey appears to have much at stake in a war.
"If it's a short and contained conflict, there is going to be a short-term hit to risk perceptions, and on the fiscal side too because tourism revenues will be down," Mr. Zuaiter said. "Long term, Turkey is well positioned to be a bridge for Western investors who want to get into Iraq."
But he cautioned prospective investors that "in a protracted war, there is a lot to lose."

 SECRETS
A Memoir of Vietnam
and the Pentagon Papers.
By Daniel Ellsberg.
Illustrated. 498 pp. New York:
Viking. $29.95.
 THERE are no new government secrets in Daniel Ellsberg's "Secrets." But you can hardly blame him for finally ruminating after the age of 71 on the familiar yet still startling events 30 years ago when his history and the nation's fatefully collided. 
For a new generation, here is the story of how Ellsberg, a former Pentagon and State Department official and defense consultant at the Rand Corporation, came to appropriate a top-secret 7,000-page government archive on the history of America's catastrophic war in Vietnam and how he gave it to The New York Times in 1971 at considerable personal risk in the hope that proof of presidential deceits would shock the nation into a withdrawal from Southeast Asia. That archive came to be known as the Pentagon papers and prompted a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court against practically every kind of censorship on national security grounds. 
But the war slogged on while the papers provoked an even more dramatic turn. A furious President Richard Nixon, frantic to prevent further leaks, set out not only to prosecute but also to smear Ellsberg personally by creating a hit team of "plumbers" to rifle the files of his former psychoanalyst. That break-in and other governmental misconduct destroyed the legal case against Ellsberg, but the plumbers survived to run other White House errands. And their break-in at the Watergate offices of the Democratic Party in 1972 eventually caused Nixon to commit obstruction of justice, the cover-up of which led in 1974 to the threat of his impeachment, his resignation and -- at long last -- the collapse of America's defense of a non-Communist South Vietnam.
An obviously intelligent, highly emotional and impulsive man, Ellsberg tracks the evolution of his sense of patriotism from bureaucrat to whistleblower. From his first days as a Pentagon aide and analyst in 1964, he saw how the bonds of secrecy and loyalty caused even the highest officials to suppress their doubts about presidential policy and to lie in its defense. On daring ventures into combat to report on conditions in Vietnam, he recognized the futility of the American cause and the fakery of internal reports of progress there. 
Not until he got to work on the history that become known as the Pentagon papers, however, did he decide that the more serious lying ran in the opposition direction -- that every president back to Truman had simultaneously misled the public about our right to interfere in Vietnam and our chances, with every military escalation, for success. America was bleeding for stalemate at best, to avoid losing terrain to the Communists and votes at home. "For Kennedy, as for Johnson, in fact, it was the president who was deceiving the public, not his subordinates who were deceiving him," Ellsberg writes.
There are, of course, more generous interpretations of presidential action, but Ellsberg no longer credits them. As he himself once believed, American leaders thought that Communist advances in nations left divided after World War II -- Germany and Korea as well as Vietnam -- had to be resisted to avoid a wider war. Their further belief that North Vietnam's attacks on the South were part of a global Chinese-Soviet aggression was surely a terrible mistake, as was the hope that a military stalemate would eventually produce a negotiated compromise that would preserve the credibility of other American commitments. Not all misjudgments, however, are crimes. 
But Ellsberg concluded in 1969, when yet another president was hanging tough in Vietnam, that he no longer considered the war "a case of good intentions that failed of their legitimate, though perhaps infeasible, aims." The Pentagon papers persuaded him that the war was unjust from the start and that unjustified killing amounted to "mass murder": "Could it ever be precipitate to end a policy of murder?" 
So he saw it as his duty to destroy a system of deceit and secrecy, a system in which Nixon and his aides believed that a president was free to leak secrets and commit burglaries and cover-ups that for all others were crimes. "In other words, they assumed that the president, and they in working for him, were above any domestic law. Along with my colleagues working on foreign policy and military matters, I certainly believed that to be true in the area of national security. . . . Along with that belief in exclusive, untrammeled presidential jurisdiction and freedom in these fields goes the assumption of unlimited right to control what the public will know about executive decision making in these matters. As I had belatedly come to see it, that way lay monarchy and more Vietnams, or worse."
And so Ellsberg removed the stamps of "Top Secret" on every page and furtively photocopied the documents that he thought proved his case. He hoped in vain that critics of the war in Congress would publish them (at less risk to himself). That failing, and believing that Nixon would keep on fighting and bombing even as he slowly withdrew American ground troops, Ellsberg finally released the papers in a conspiratorial dance with the Times correspondent Neil Sheehan. When the courts temporarily stopped The Times from publication, he gave the papers to The Washington Post, and parts of them to a dozen other publications. The Pentagon history stopped in 1968, but Nixon feared that other disclosures would reflect on him as well as on the Democrats. So he called for his plumbers, and drowned in their criminal flood. 
There remains, however, a vexing personal secret at the heart of the Ellsberg morality tale: what peculiar combination of genes, brains and circumstance produced such an adventurer? Ellsberg repeatedly risked life and limb in Vietnam for a few morsels of information and takes obvious pleasure now in reproducing long, indeed tedious accounts of his derring-do. As a Marine officer and civilian cold warrior, he was drawn to the thick of the action and came to feel superior to those who shunned such risk. And so it was when he switched sides, longing for a leading role in the army of war resisters. Neither modesty nor moderation are much in evidence in his life and memoir. 
So why not truly reveal himself? Readers should feel cheated by Ellsberg's reluctance to surrender more of his inner loves and torments. The drama of his life lay in his extreme exchange of idols, as he puts it, from the worship of a gun-toting John Wayne to the veneration of pacifist fighters like Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Yet the crucial moments of his transformations are only sparingly examined. 
What is the meaning and relevance of the cryptic fact that Ellsberg was raised as a Christian by Christian Scientist parents, but told by his father that "we were Jews, though 'not in religion' "? What was his upbringing and schooling? Why psychoanalysis? And was it only coincidence that his shifts of public career and conviction ran parallel to his private affections? 
It was when married to the daughter of a Marine colonel that Ellsberg became a Marine officer, "enjoyed" life as a platoon leader in a rifle company and extended his term of service to stay with his unit in a Middle East hot spot. Years later, while he was awaiting divorce, his first date with Patricia Marx took him to a protest rally against the Vietnam war. But when he then misinterpreted her "burst of feeling for a radical German poet," he suddenly fled the safety of the Pentagon and volunteered for high-risk missions in Vietnam.
In time, Marx had to prove that she was "adventurous enough" for him by wading into the holy, ash-laden waters of the Ganges, but their continuing arguments over Vietnam disrupted their engagement for four more years. She finally emerges as "the love of my life" and a collaborator in the Pentagon papers escapade, but only after another woman had infected Ellsberg with the philosophy of Gandhian civil disobedience. She was an Indian whom he overheard saying in early 1968 that she came "from a culture in which there is no concept of enemy." From "someone less striking," he might have let the remark slip, he recalls; but she was "beautiful, and her speech was like singing," and she taught him that wrongdoing was "not merely to be condemned but to be resisted, nonviolently but militantly, at personal cost to oneself."
All these obviously influential female and family spirits make only cameo appearances in Ellsberg's memoir. He has left room for a genuinely revealing sequel.

JOINED AT THE HEART
The Transformation of the American Family.
By Al Gore and Tipper Gore.
Illustrated. 417 pp. New York:
Henry Holt & Company. $26.
 SOMEWHERE, in the bowels of some Republican opposition research operation, "Joined at the Heart" is no doubt getting an exceedingly close reading by eagle-eyed young conservatives in search of ammunition for 2004. After all, the right considered Al Gore's last serious book, "Earth in the Balance," a treasure-trove of wacky liberal thought about the environment, demonstrating Gore's unsuitability for the presidency, or at the very least his unsuitability to receive the votes of autoworkers and coal miners in key states.
It is, in short, very hard to read "Joined at the Heart" outside its political context as a book by a once and perhaps future Democratic contender. Which is probably too bad. At face value, this is an earnest and sympathetic account of the strains on the modern American family, at a time when what passes for a serious debate about families in Washington is how much to cut the estate tax. "Joined at the Heart," written with Tipper Gore, talks about the struggle to balance work and family, to build marriages that last, to blend stepchildren and stepparents into a supportive whole, to deal with disability and illness among children and aged parents when everybody is working outside the home. 
All of this, of course, is vastly more complicated when people have greater expectations of what a marriage should be, and when the demands of work and the tether of technology are steadily eroding what used to be "family time." As the Gores put it, "the ways we work, commute, communicate and learn have all been revolutionized over the past few generations," creating "a new emotional landscape with few of the guideposts and landmarks by which families used to get their bearings."
Consider the sheer amount of work performed by a two-parent family today: citing a study by the Economic Policy Institute, the Gores point out that between 1989 and 1998 alone, the total number of hours worked annually by middle-income mothers and fathers rose by 246 -- an extra six full-time workweeks a year. The Gores note that two-thirds of American families no longer eat dinner together regularly -- and of the third who do, half of them are watching television while they eat. They write that the average child over 8 watches three and a half hours of television a day, in part because weary parents use it as a baby sitter at the end of a long day.
Stressed-out families have little time for other forms of connection: while the World War II generation was "a generation of great joiners, organizers and supporters of clubs and civic organizations," membership has fallen steadily since. The way so many postwar communities were built -- the suburban sprawl that Al Gore tried to make an issue in 2000 -- works against the very idea of community. "A family that lives in a neighborhood with sidewalks, playgrounds and pleasant stores within walking distance has a very different relationship to the community than a family that must drive to purchase even the most basic amenity," the Gores write.
Against these darker trends, the Gores tell little homilies of hope. An Indianapolis man who grew up in a family filled with turmoil finds a way to create a happy family of his own, thanks to a strong male role model and a disciplined wife. A Southeastern couple divorce but stay closely connected through the shared care and custody of their disabled son. A gay couple adopt two children, one of them the son of an addicted, H.I.V.-positive mother, and build a strong two-parent family not unlike the ones they grew up in in Maryland. 
The hunger for family runs deep, the Gores conclude, even if it is redefined, based on bonds of love rather than blood and economic necessity, and tested by the culture as never before. This bracing truth is captured in "The Spirit of Family" (Holt, $35), a companion collection of more than 250 photographs of American families they compiled. 
"Joined at the Heart" has the tone, at times, of one of those dinner party seminars that Al Gore was once famous for, with walk-on parts for leading experts like Robert Putnam (on the decline of civic participation in the modern era) or T. Berry Brazelton (on the emotional development of children). It can be preachy and didactic, and there were times when I could hear Al Gore's voice explaining some social trend veerrry sloooowwwly so I could un-der-staaaaand it.
The Gores' tendency to use examples from their own family life is also, at times, distracting. These are careful little glimpses of the private life of this most public of families -- Tipper's battle with depression after her son is seriously injured, Al's tendency to disappear into work, the complicated emotional legacy from Tipper's mother and the long shadow of Al's father. The cynic in me wondered if these struggles had really ended as neatly as the book suggests, or whether the Gores had tidied them up, consciously or not, for political consumption, to make some uplifting argument and to humanize a candidate widely scorned for not being human enough.
At one point, "Joined at the Heart" describes the elaborate roughhousing games that the Gore children played each day when Al got home, a glimpse of the former vice president in a state of ease that was rarely seen in his public life. But then, very quickly, the old Al-Gore-as-national-teacher returns, making the somewhat obvious observation that "at every stage of our lives, play is essential to who we are as human beings and vital to how we find strength and happiness in our families."
Whatever the reason, psychological or political, the Gores seem to be struggling to break out of their roles in this book, to be something other than the candidate and the candidate's wife. There were times, in fact, when I was hungry for more discussion of actual public policy in "Joined at the Heart," and less therapy-speak about the need for communication in families. Only in the last chapter do the Gores really talk about the public policy implications of the book, like the need for universal preschool and more assistance for long-term care.
But the Gores deserve credit for simply paying attention to what has become the unmentionable elephant in the room of Washington politics: that American families are not what they were. It is an easy subject to dismiss, as something on the feminized margins, at a time of war. But as "Joined at the Heart" suggests, the threat of war is not the only anxiety among families these days -- and maybe not even the greatest.

HEADLINE: Who Needs the U.N. Security Council? 

BYLINE:  By James Traub; James Traub is a contributing writer for the Times magazine.

 BODY:
The Mission of France to the United Nations is located on the 44th floor of a high-rise building on East 47th Street, just a few blocks from the U.N. itself. When I went to visit Jean-David Levitte, France's ambassador to the U.N., in the midst of the tortured and enormously protracted negotiations over a resolution requiring Iraq to accept a team of U.N. weapons inspectors and disarm, Levitte drew me to the south-facing plate-glass window of his office and delivered an ever-so-slightly defensive speech on Franco-American amity. "I watched the World Trade Center buildings come down from here," he said. "At that time, France was president of the Security Council, and the very next day, Sept. 12, we introduced Resolution 1368, which, for the first time in U.N. history, described a terrorist attack as a threat to international peace and security" -- and thus gave the United States an unequivocal right to retaliate against Al Qaeda and against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. 
 The campaign against Al Qaeda represented one of those rare moments when the Security Council swings quickly behind American aims. The U.N. itself felt implicated in the terrorist attack: its headquarters was evacuated both that day and the next, and there was brief talk of holding a Security Council meeting in a local coffee shop. But the moment of solidarity couldn't last. For the Security Council, Afghanistan was a momentary departure from a tradition of conflict resolution; for the Bush Administration, it was the first battle in a global war. 
 It is not only the United States but also the United Nations that has become a different place after 9/11. Only yesterday, it seems, the great issue was getting an increasingly disengaged United States to pay its back dues and pay attention; now the problem is keeping an aroused America from sallying off on what virtually every other member of the Security Council considers a reckless crusade. The Security Council needs the United States in order for it to play a meaningful role in world affairs, but it appears as though the United States doesn't need the Security Council -- or at least that many of the leading members of the Bush administration think that it doesn't. Secretary of State George Marshall had predicted in 1948 that should there be "a complete lack of power equilibrium in the world, the United Nations cannot function successfully." And now, for the first time since the U.N.'s establishment, that state of affairs has come to pass. 
And so the resolution on Iraq has been the first test case of the new world of American supersupremacy. As Gelson Fonseca, the Brazilian ambassador to the U.N., put it archly, "You have a situation of dual containment: you have to contain the United States; you have to contain Iraq." Containing the Bush administration has meant finding a middle ground between rubber-stamping American policy -- and thus making the council superfluous -- and blocking American policy, and thus provoking America to unilateral action, which of course would make the council irrelevant. Fonseca seemed to feel that containing the U.S. is a harder job than containing Iraq, and possibly a more important one. 
As I prepared to leave after talking to Levitte, he said, "You know, I told you this story about Resolution 1368 because I want you to understand something: we want the United States in." Of course they do. But what neither Levitte nor his colleagues know for sure is what it will take to keep the Bush administration in. Last week, the Security Council unanimously passed a resolution demanding that Iraq allow the weapons inspectors who left four years ago not only to return but also to conduct more rigorous inspections for signs of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons production. If Saddam rebuffs the inspectors, there will almost surely be war. If he meekly complies, there probably won't. But Saddam may decide to test the fragile entente now reigning in the council by complying well enough for the French and the Russians but not well enough for the Americans. And then . . . who knows? 
The central question posed by the debate over Iraq remains: Is the blessing of the international community so valuable a good that even this administration, at this moment of American power, is prepared to sacrifice something of its freedom of action in order to secure it? And if it is not, what, exactly, is the Security Council for? 
The Security Council has for many years been a dim shadow of what it was intended to be by the architects of the U.N. system. In "F.D.R. and the Creation of the U.N.," Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley argue that from the earliest days of World War II, President Roosevelt foresaw a new world order governed by what he called "the Four Policemen" -- the United States, Great Britain, Russia and China. The failure of the post-World War I League of Nations had made Roosevelt skeptical of the merits of a world body, but by 1942, Sumner Welles, his under secretary of state, had drawn up a proposal for a "United Nations Authority" with a "security commission" of the four policemen, who would provide the forces needed to quash threats to world peace. At Teheran in November 1943, Roosevelt persuaded Stalin to accept a single, centralized body consisting of all the world's nations and governed by a council dominated by the big four. (France was added later.) Secretary of State Cordell Hull addressed a joint session of Congress and magnificently asserted, "There will no longer be need for spheres of influence, for alliances, for balances of power."
The Security Council, then, was a new system, designed to prevent another 1914 or 1939, in which the most powerful nations would exercise an effective monopoly on force. Sir Brian Urquhart, one of the first employees of the United Nations and later one of its most important chroniclers, says: "We got into World War I owing to a kind of ludicrous diplomatic folk dance that didn't pan out, and there was no international delay mechanism, no breakwater to stop this rush to war; and that's what they set up the League of Nations to prevent. Then in 1939, you had a war caused by unchecked aggression. And so the new side of the U.N. as opposed to the league is that it provides a mechanism for taking action." The Security Council, which would consist of the five "permanent members" as well as 10 other members who would rotate on and off, was intended to serve both as a "delay mechanism" and, should deliberations fail, as an enforcement body. 
The United Nations Charter, drawn up in San Francisco in the summer of 1945, makes amazing reading today, when American conservatives talk about signing on to U.N. treaties as a surrender of national sovereignty. Chapter VII deals with "Action with respect to threats to the peace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression." Article 42 of Chapter VII empowers the Security Council to "take such action by air, sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security." Article 43 requires U.N. members to make armed forces and "facilities" available to the body "on its call." And Article 47 establishes a "Military Staff Committee," consisting of the five permanent members' chiefs of staff, which would be responsible for the "strategic direction of any armed forces placed at the disposal of the Security Council." What is perhaps even more amazing, from our own perspective, is that Congress passed the U.N. Charter almost without debate. 
Nevertheless, it was clear even at the time that the five permanent nations, soon to be abbreviated as the P5, might not permit their foreign policies to be directed by the Security Council. Stalin insisted on veto power for each of the P5 members, as did, if less vehemently, the United States. And then the cold war settled in, and each side used its veto, or the threat of one, to check initiatives dear to the other. Urquhart recalls that the U.S. had agreed to make a "very substantial force" available for Chapter VII enforcement actions, but that the entire arrangement was scuttled in the late 40's when Stalin balked at the idea. Roosevelt's dream of a global police force led by the great powers died before it could even be tested. 
But something else was happening at the same time. The process of "decolonization" was unfolding much faster than anyone had expected, and new nations were pouring into the United Nations. Chapter VII was already a memory by the time most of these third-world nations joined, and in any case, the new members were more concerned with economic development than with peacekeeping. Starting in the 1950's, the U.N. began to spawn a whole range of agencies largely directed at the needs of the new members -- bodies dealing with health, food, education, relief, refugees and so on. And the culture of the institution drifted further and further from the muscular principles of Chapter VII. This is the domain most of us associate with the U.N. -- high-minded confabulations on intractable global problems, solar-powered cookers, declarations on the rights of historically oppressed communities, etc. This sense of an organization preoccupied with terribly important things it can't actually do very much about has not done much for the U.N.'s reputation, at least in the United States.
But the U.N. does not, of course, belong to the United States. David Malone, a former Canadian diplomat who runs the International Peace Academy, a research group far more hardheaded than its fuzzy-sounding name implies, notes: "The U.N. in its own mind is largely about a positive agenda that the agencies deliver. Many members aren't comfortable with anything beyond the positive agenda. They view the fight against bad guys and evil as incompatible with the ethos of the organization and being conducted at the behest of a few big powers they don't trust." By the end of the cold war, 90 percent of the U.N.'s resources were being devoted to the agencies; peacekeeping had become a vestigial activity, carried out largely in quiet places like Cyprus.
And then came the U.N.'s very own Prague Spring. The ideological deadlock of the cold war was melting away, and with it the constraints on the Security Council. Saddam Hussein came along just when the Security Council was ready to deal with him. When Iraq overran Kuwait in 1990, the council passed a resolution of condemnation. Once the first President Bush decided on a war, he sought a Security Council resolution before he went to Congress, calculating, correctly, that the authority of the council would pressure the Congress into approval -- the exact opposite of the thinking that has governed the current Bush administration. And the council, after a very brief debate, invoked Chapter VII to authorize a coalition force to dislodge the Iraqi forces. 
The war was, of course, a great success, and an excited President Bush became the tribune of a new U.N. Veterans of the organization still recall with wonder the speech in which Bush offered to turn over Fort Dix for the training of U.N. peacekeepers. In June 1992, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, acting at the behest of the permanent five, submitted "An Agenda for Peace," which argued that the time had come to rejuvenate U.N. enforcement and to make the Security Council the genuine global peacekeeper envisioned by Chapter VII. It was a moment of euphoria throughout the U.N. community. There was a feeling, as Shashi Tharoor, the U.N.'s head of public information and one of its chief institutional voices, recalls, that "every problem can come to us, and we can prescribe a solution." Boutros-Ghali, Tharoor told me, "even spoke rashly of 'a problem of too much credibility.' Within two and a half years he was eating those words, because we had a crisis of too little credibility."
What happened, of course, was Srebenica -- a byword for moral failure. This fiasco virtually discredited U.N. peacekeeping. Perhaps the fault lay less with the U.N. than with the nations of the Security Council, which were unwilling to send the kind of troops needed to counter the savagery of the Bosnian conflict. Perhaps the fault lay with the expectations themselves. William Shawcross wrote an account of peacekeeping efforts titled "Deliver Us From Evil." That was the job description; but peacekeeping could not deliver the world from evil. 
No one knows the answer to the peacekeeping problem. If you ask people around the U.N. what will happen the next time genocide threatens -- say, in Burundi -- the answer will be, "We'll authorize a regional organization to go in." Few people expect a U.N. force of "blue helmets" to venture into mayhem. And if you point out that no "regional organizations" happen to exist in the neighborhood of Burundi -- well, that's true. 
Throughout the late 90's, conservatives like John Ashcroft accused the Clinton administration of seeking to "subcontract" American foreign policy to the U.N. The Bush administration took office vowing never to fall into that trap. While still an adviser to the campaign, Condoleezza Rice, later Bush's national security adviser, criticized the belief that "the support of many states -- or even better, of institutions like the United Nations -- is essential to the legitimate exercise of power." Legitimacy, for at least most members of the Bush foreign-policy team, arose from a clearheaded assessment of national interest; little could be expected from the U.N., a moralistic body squeamish about the exercise of power and largely hostile to American interests. Only a few in the administration, most notably Secretary of State Colin Powell, believed that acting in concert with others was such a good in itself that the U.S. should seek to do so whenever possible. 
Exhibit A in the indictment of U.N. pusillanimity handed up by the hawkish wing of the Bush team was policy toward Iraq. In the aftermath of the gulf war, the Security Council established the combination of harsh economic sanctions, "no fly" zones and weapons inspections that more or less kept Saddam Hussein in his cage. But by 1998, inspectors were complaining of constant interference, and in December of that year, the United States and the British insisted -- over the objections of the French and the Russians -- that the inspectors be withdrawn, and then mounted a bombing campaign directed at Iraqi weapons sites. Since that time, the Security Council had seemed to be much more disturbed by the consequences of confronting Iraq than by the consequences of failing to do so. The big issue in the Security Council last year was not Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction but the harm done by the sanctions. Russia, Iraq's chief ally among the P5, argued that Iraq had fully disarmed itself of nuclear weapons and began agitating to have the "nuclear file" closed and Iraq be given some benefit for its compliance.
Until Sept. 11 of last year, the Bush administration officially viewed Iraq less as a threat to world peace than as a hopeless mess; Secretary of State Colin Powell had even taken up the call for less burdensome "smart sanctions." After the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the Bush administration, worried about Saddam making chemical and biological and nuclear weapons and perhaps allowing them to slip into the hands of terrorists, was prepared to disarm him by any means. When Bush addressed the General Assembly two months ago, he asserted provocatively that the U.N. would turn into a League of Nations if it continued to permit Saddam Hussein to keep inspectors out in defiance of U.N. resolutions. 
When I suggested to Levitte, the French ambassador, that the Security Council would never have acted to restore inspectors to Iraq without the American threat of war, he said: "This is absolutely true. But let's be fair. What is the Security Council? The Americans tend to consider that there is somewhere a supreme power imposing its will on America. It is 15 members; it is not a kind of supreme power. And the United States is first among equals."
And that is why the president's bristling speech provoked nervous applause, a few snide jokes and, as David Malone of the International Peace Academy says, "an instant refocusing on Iraqi noncompliance." The threat of war, of course, concentrated many minds, but it is also true that the United States can determine the agenda of the Security Council if it wants to, even if it cannot quite dictate outcomes. That has not always been true, but the era of ideological opposition to the United States, whether from the Soviet bloc or the third world, has largely come to an end; it has been a long time since anyone called for a "new world economic order" to redistribute wealth to poor nations. There is a widespread acceptance in the U.N. of the fact of American supremacy, even if high-handed American behavior has left a deep residue of resentment. 
It is, in fact, precisely because the U.N. system cares so much about preserving its own relevance that the members have generally resigned themselves to the new American hegemony. Even the Security Council's most zealous defenders recognize that it must be a "mirror" of world power in order to remain effective. And so council members have tended to swallow their anger over American arrogance. "With the amount of hair we tear out of our heads over the United States, we should all be bald," a representative of one of America's allies put it. You often hear expressions of gratitude over even minimal American gestures of respect for the U.N., like Shashi Tharoor's comment that "in a case where the United States is acting in the name of the international community, the fact that it has come to seek the blessings of the international community is welcome." 
Diplomats are trained to accept reality and work with it -- to play a weak hand as strongly as they can. Whenever I think of the U.N., I picture Gelson Fonseca, the Brazilian ambassador, a charming, bushy-browed, multilingual gentleman possessed of a strikingly sinuous mind. "Diplomacy is about an illusion," Fonseca told me recently, "the illusion that I am equal to you. When I sit across the table from America, I have the illusion that I can convert you by the force of my argument, and you, in order to sit across the table from me, must share that illusion." And yet because it is an illusion, Fonseca accepts the fact that the United States cannot be successfully confronted; it must rather, he says, be "seduced" -- a very Brazilian approach to diplomacy. What Fonseca means is that diplomacy in the unipolar world must be devoted to coaxing the United States inside the system of rules and institutions. Like many of his colleagues, he has a tremendous fear of a United States freed from those constraints; he would almost rather surrender to American wishes than see the U.S. dismiss the Security Council. "Order," Fonseca says, "is better than justice."
And so, as the first debate in this new era of American dominance got under way in September, the Security Council was prepared to play a weak hand strongly; but no one could say for sure whether the Bush administration was willing to play at all. The administration had come grudgingly to the negotiating table, and the initial draft resolution circulated by the Americans included elements so manifestly intolerable to the Iraqis -- like the idea of a military force supporting U.N. inspectors -- that it appeared to be designed to be repudiated, and thus to bring about the war that Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other leading figures in the administration were strongly suggesting was the only alternative. This was too great a price for the U.N. to pay. At a gathering in mid-September, a group of diplomats and top U.N. officials asked themselves whether they should simply accept the invitation to rubber-stamp American policy. "The preponderant view was that this was not better," says Paul Heinbecker, the U.N. ambassador from Canada, which is not currently a Security Council member. "The U.N. has to stand for something; it has to have some principles."
It was left to the French to state those principles. No major nation cherishes the illusory equality of the U.N. more than the French, whose sense of great-power standing depends almost entirely on their membership in the P5. The French were infuriated in 1998 when the British and the Americans bombed Iraq without seeking council authorization. The French would not permit the council to be sidelined once again. In late September, the French proposed that in the event of Iraqi noncompliance with the inspections regime, the United States be compelled to seek a second Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force. The Russians publicly, and other members of the council privately, backed the French position. After several weeks of deadlocked talks, the Americans, working with the British, proposed compromise language in which the Security Council would "convene immediately" for deliberations in the case of Iraqi noncompliance, though the administration would not have to seek further authority from the council to begin a military assault. This was a two-step process, not the two-resolution process the French wanted, but it took only a small sophistry to blur the distinction. The French accepted.
I happened to visit Levitte two days after the new American language arrived. Levitte is a rising star in French diplomacy, the former foreign-policy advisor to President Jacques Chirac and a new kind of French diplomat, informal and affable. He insisted that the French position had much less to do with a sense of national prerogative than with the need for a united front. "In France, we have five to six million Muslims," he said, "between 8 and 10 percent of the population." In case of war, he went on, "we have to do whatever is possible to limit the bitterness. It is in our common interest to move step by step. If Saddam Hussein violates the rules set by the international community, then it is not a unilateral act of aggression against Saddam Hussein. It is Saddam Hussein who is creating an attack against the international community. "
This was not only a French position; I heard some variant of it from other members of the council and even more from U.N. professionals who feared they would have to live with a Middle Eastern world aflame with anger. For them, "international legitimacy" was not a diplomatic nicety or an abstraction; it was the means by which war became a collective good rather than an exercise in American self-interest. Beyond Iraq, there was anxiety that American action could loose the dogs of unilateralism; Russia could well cite the Iraqi precedent to take its own war on Chechen terrorism into neighboring Georgia. And so the other council members were imploring the United States to stay inside the international system as the price for their acquiescence to a process that might well lead to war -- a war that virtually none of them believed in. 
But the French also understood that simply by agreeing to engage in diplomacy, the Bush administration had already accepted some limits on its freedom of action in order to gain the imprimatur of a Security Council resolution. At this critical moment, according to administration sources, Bush had come down on the side of Powell and the multilateralists. What happened? First of all, polls showed that a clear majority of Americans preferred the inspections-first route and would be much more comfortable with a war conducted with United Nations support -- a source of tremendous comfort within the United Nations itself. Moreover, the U.N. had hardly been unresponsive as regards the war on terrorism. As Richard Haass, a senior State Department official (and a strong advocate of the multilateralist view), puts it, "This is the second major issue we have brought to the U.N., the first being Afghanistan, and there we did just fine." Haass adds, "You've got to ask yourself what's the price in terms of delay and constraint, and what the benefits are." 
Those benefits were overwhelming: a military threat backed by a united Security Council would be far likelier to persuade Saddam Hussein to disarm, and in the event of war, the United States would be much likelier to obtain overflight rights and access to Middle East bases. (There would also, in all likelihood, be financial support and international help in administering postwar Iraq.) 
And so with Secretary Powell conducting the negotiations (the American ambassador to the U. N., John Negroponte, served largely as a message carrier), the Bush administration ultimately came a long way toward the French position, leaving more latitude to the inspectors and modifying language that appeared to provide a pretext for war no matter what the Iraqis did -- what the French called "automaticity."At the dramatic Security Council meeting at which all 15 nations endorsed the resolution, Negroponte explicitly confirmed that the language permitted no automaticity.
But the session also exposed the continuing deep fears among council members of the administration's unilateralist impulses. When Ireland's ambassador to the United Nations said at the meeting, "It is for the council to decide on any ensuing action," no one could mistake his meaning. Bush administration officials, on the other hand, fear that council members will try to block a military response. The era of good feelings could dissipate fast. 
every other friday, the military attaches of the five permanent members of the Security Council meet in a conference room at the U.N., read the minutes of their last meeting -- which consist only of the reading of the minutes of their previous meeting -- and then adjourn. This is all that remains of the Military Staff Committee established by Article 47 of the U.N. Charter. And it is virtually all that remains of the founding vision of the Security Council as an institutionalized version of the World War II alliance. And yet as the debate over the Iraq resolution demonstrates, the Security Council has not been consigned to irrelevance. As Edward Luck, the author of "Mixed Messages," a history of America's turbulent relationship with the U.N., observes, "While the Security Council may have failed as a military tool, as a political tool it's more important than ever." Luck predicts that "the demand of the American public for international authorization is going to become greater and greater." 
The Security Council need not be wholly reduced to its legitimacy-granting function. The U.N. and its various agencies have built up enormous expertise in the thankless task of nation building; one U.N. official says that the Bush administration even approached the organization to take over the civil administration of Afghanistan after the Taliban had been dislodged, a role that it has played in East Timor and elsewhere. (The U.N. had the good sense to decline.) The American resolve to engage in strategic nation wrecking may increasingly force the Security Council, which will be asked to authorize these missions, into the role of picking up the pieces. 
But in a world defined by the fight against terrorism, which is to say a world shaped by a single power overwhelmingly preoccupied with the fight against terrorism, the Security Council's central role will be to shape the terms and establish the conditions under which that fight becomes broadly acceptable. Its job is both to restrain and to license the superpower.
Conservative critics of the U.N., some of whom now occupy important posts in the Bush administration, have long argued that the Security Council is useful only when it accepts American leadership and embraces American interests -- which, they would add, is virtually never. And yet what has become obvious in recent weeks is that with only the most modest gestures toward multilateralism on the part of the U.S., the Security Council is prepared to offer that embrace. And the Bush administration is likely to hug back when it suits its needs. It's a relationship of convenience. But it's a relationship.
One Security Council diplomat who finds this prospect both professionally pleasing and deeply gratifying to his sense of irony points out that the final draft of the Iraq resolution essentially gives Hans Blix, the head of the U.N. inspection team, the power to decide whether or not the Iraqis are in compliance (though Blix has told the Council he doesn't want to bear that burden). Blix, he points out, "is a nice, soft-spoken, grandfatherly Swede, not an American, not a warmonger" -- the perfect legitimator of the American war effort. "If the war comes," he adds, "I see Bush making an 8 o'clock speech to the nation, with Hans Blix mentioned at least 10 times."

HEADLINE: L.I. @ WORK; 
For Cablevision, Bright Spots in a Gloomy Year

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
THERE had not been too much news coming out of the Cablevision Systems Corporation of late, and most of that had been dreary. The well-publicized spat earlier this year with the New York Yankees over broadcast rights went unresolved, a metaphor for a difficult and frustrating year.
 Earlier this month, all that changed. Increasingly eager for cash, the company struck two major deals. The first was a blockbuster: Cablevision sold its Bravo network to NBC, owned by the General Electric Corporation, for $1.25 billion, most of it in stock. The transaction will generate about $310 million in cash for Cablevision at a time when the company increasingly needs capital to fend off competition from satellite rivals. 
 The second deal was smaller, a $75 million stake taken in the company by Quadrangle Capital Partners, a Manhattan investment bank. The transaction meant more cash for Cablevision and an expected directorship for Steven Rattner, a principal in Quadrangle and a well-regarded investor in media companies. Both deals are expected to significantly ease, if not eliminate, any cash-flow problems in 2003. 
In the cable industry deals often come in clusters, and during a Nov. 7 conference call with analysts, James L. Dolan, the company's chief executive, fielded questions about whether the American Movie Channel, with 81 million subscribers, might be the next Cablevision property to go. 
"I know there's been quite a lot of speculation about A.M.C.," he said. "Basically, if the right offer comes along, we would be likely to take it."
Cablevision executives, famously tight-lipped, were uncharacteristically talkative that morning. "We're very, very pleased with the $1.25 billion sale price" for Bravo, said William Bell, a vice chairman of the company. "This transaction affirms our ability to raise a significant amount of capital at private market values, thereby not diluting our shareholders. The sale also reflected how marketable and highly valuable the company's programming assets are."
Like the rest of the cable television industry, Cablevision is fighting off competition from satellite broadcasters on one hand and exploring its own satellite options on the other. When questioned by an analyst during the conference call, Mr. Dolan was quick to tout the company's satellite venture, which will begin in March at a cost of about $75 million. The analysts were particularly interested since federal regulators have challenged merger plans between two satellite companies, Echostar Communications and the Hughes Electronics Corporation. Cablevision had been in talks with Echostar about a satellite deal that would have expanded in value after the merger, but the prospects dimmed when merger seemed less likely to go through.
The talk of such prospective big deals nearly eclipsed the announced topic of the conference call -- Cablevision's third-quarter earnings report -- just as a Hollywood blockbuster might pull the audience away from a government committee meeting on a community-access channel.
At best, the quarterly numbers were mixed. Cablevision reported a net loss for the quarter of $79.5 million, compared with $77.1 million for the same quarter last year. The company wrote off $75 million and laid off about 2,400 employees, half of them at the Wiz, Cablevision's chain of electronics stores. The company lowered growth forecasts for cable, Internet and telephone services, if only by a couple of percentage points. And more than 22,000 basic cable subscribers defected.
But there was a positive side. Revenues exceeded $951 million, compared with $911 million in the same quarter last year. The results beat the consensus figure of $883 million. And at its core cable business, revenue rose 9 percent, some of it from subscribers who spent more on new digital cable services and high-speed Internet access. Even before the recent deals, cash flow had improved significantly. 
Optimum Online, a cable modem service offering high-speed Internet access, was one bright spot. Optimum Online exceeded expectations, as did Interactive Optimum, the company's digital TV service. Interactive Optimum, which delivers video on demand, digital music and only-on-Cablevision programs, had recruited 80,400 subscribers by the quarter's end.
Cablevision executives have, of course, played up the positive numbers, after being hit hard on a number of fronts during the year. Its investments in upgrading to digital systems have been slow to pay off, competition from satellite broadcasters has eaten into market share and its diverse entertainment investments -- its complex portfolio also includes Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall and the Clearview Cinema chain -- have been hurt by sluggish consumer spending. 
But the company has taken steps to stanch the bleeding. Both the theater chain and the Wiz went on the block in August, a step analysts had long called for. The company has also closed 26 underperforming Wiz locations and has remodeled the 17 remaining stores.. 
Previous deals, which in a go-go economy had looked so promising, have come back to haunt Cablevision. Earlier this year, as government prosecution efforts grew in response to the wave of corporate scandals, Cablevision officials kept a nervous eye on the case building against the Adelphia Communications Corporation, the cable giant with which it had completed a major asset and stock swap in 2001. In June, when two senior Adelphia executives were arrested on fraud charges, Cablevision issued an unusual press release detailing its own accounting processes. Cablevision has not been charged with any accounting irregularities. 
With Interactive Optimum, the company earned critical plaudits for its innovative technology and ambitious programming. Subscribers, many of whom had to wait for their neighborhoods to be wired, have begun to enroll. Cablevision has jettisoned its original partner, Sony, which manufactured the set-top boxes for the interactive service, and has signed on with Scientific Atlanta, which introduced a lower-cost alternative. Although its promotions for the new service seemed indifferent at first, Cablevision has since advertised it aggressively and craftily on its own channels, and at little cost.
Cablevision listed other highlights for the quarter:
*Consumer services reported a record quarter with the addition of 107,000 new high-speed data and digital video customers.
*Optimum Online added nearly 70,000 customers. The service now reaches one out of five Cablevision customers, the highest penetration rate in the industry.
*Interactive Optimum added 38,000 new customers for the quarter, nearly doubling in size, to 80,000.
*The Wiz is expected to break even in 2003. 
Jessica Reif Cohen, a Merrill Lynch investment analyst, said the company's third-quarter performance was strong by most measurements, despite the larger-than-expected loss of basic subscribers. Lightpath, its telephone operation, also performed impressively, she said, "particularly in light of the difficult telecommunications environment." 
Mr. Rattner, the investor and a prospective director, said: "Cablevision is a fabulous asset. It has terrific management, and the company is grievously undervalued by the market."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
To Cure Economy, Best Doctor Is Still the Fed

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
NOW that the Republicans have regained control of Congress, President Bush has promised to give the economy a good prodding. But before he does, he may want to consider three questions: whether the economy actually needs more help to get back on its feet; whether a fiscal stimulus could work quickly enough to be useful; and what kind of stimulus would help taxpayers the most.
 For starters, the economy is not shrinking as it was in 2001. It achieved an average growth rate of about 3 percent through the first three quarters of this year. Even if the fourth quarter is disappointing, as many economists expect, 2002 will still go down as a year of historically reasonable growth. 
 Two weeks ago, the National Bureau of Economic Research committee that serves as an official arbiter of recessions said, "The behavior of the economy in the first eight months of 2002 indicates that the decline in activity that began last year may have come to an end." It will take longer to figure out just when the recession ended, but the data suggests that the economy has come through the worst.
Yet some people may want the economy to grow faster than it would on its own.
"We're not likely to get the kind of vigorous growth that would bring down the unemployment rate quickly, absent any fiscal stimulus," said Richard B. Berner, the chief domestic economist at Morgan Stanley.
The federal government may indeed have the tools to improve Americans' well-being by cushioning their incomes -- either through entitlements or tax cuts -- and trying to spark job creation with incentives for business. Still, there are the questions of timeliness and effectiveness.
Making permanent the 10-year slate of tax cuts that President Bush signed in 2001 falls short on both counts. First of all, by the time Democrats exhaust their tactics for blocking such a bill, the economy may be in fine shape.
But putting delays aside -- say the bill has already been passed -- would a tax cut in 2012 increase consumers' spending today? Not if they thought that another administration might tinker with tax rates sometime between now and then. Few banks would lend them money on the assumption that lower taxes 10 years away would make repayment easier.
There are ways to put more money in the hands of people who will spend it, and soon. Mr. Berner recommends a cut in the Social Security payroll tax, which all working Americans pay. He also said another extension of unemployment benefits could help. On the whole, he said, "there's been a little too much discussion on the marginal tax rate debate and maybe not enough on looking at other ways to approach the issue."
Indeed, the federal government may be able to make the difference between a rather painful, fairly slow recovery and a slightly less painful, not quite as slow recovery. As that language attests, though, the difference is only a matter of degree. The most important prerequisite for a good-as-can-be-expected recovery is probably the determined stance of the Federal Reserve Board.
The most recent recession before last year's ended in March 1991, according to the National Bureau. At the end of 1990, the Fed began a yearlong campaign of cuts in short-term interest rates, followed by an additional half-point cut in the following 12 months. Sound familiar? Then the Fed kept interest rates low (with the bank-to-bank overnight loan rate at 3 percent) for a third year before cautiously tightening credit.
The president for most of that time, George H. W. Bush, did so little about the economy that he squandered approval ratings of 90 percent and lost the next election -- an example his son fears repeating. 
From the economy's perspective, though, doing nothing doesn't seem like such a bad idea. That long period of easy money in the early 1990's set the stage for the most durable economic boom on record.
BECAUSE of idiosyncrasies in the business cycle, it may be foolhardy to base policy prescriptions on just one historical example. The National Bureau, after all, looks at the last six recessions when trying to gauge the timing of the most recent downturn.
Yet the economy has changed profoundly since the earliest of those six recessions ended in 1961. Back then, 62 percent of the nation's nonfarm jobs were in the service sector, which typically has a smoother business cycle than manufacturing. Today, about 80 percent of workers are in services.
Also in the last four decades, the Fed has improved its job performance, by most analysts' reckoning. The government's ability to fine-tune fiscal policy, by contrast, seems to be just as scattershot as ever. Taking action might help President Bush, but it might not help the economy.

To the Editor:
Re "A Guru, Visiting India, Is Welcomed to Seattle" (news article, Nov. 14):
 Bill Gates's visit to Bangalore is uplifting news -- for India. 
 Companies that "outsource" programming work overseas are exploiting the difference between living standards in the United States and the third world, pure and simple. Their executives enjoy the comfort of living in America, but ship thousands of high-tech jobs overseas, where lunch costs 40 cents. 
In recent years Americans were advised to become "knowledge workers," such as computer programmers, to escape the fate of factory workers. It's turning out to be empty advice. After the dot-com crash and with today's stagnant economy, why does the government make it easy to send programming work overseas? 
How can it be in the American interest to let these jobs go?

HEADLINE: Playing the Angles in Class-Action Lawsuits 

BYLINE:  By ADAM LIPTAK 

 BODY:
THIS summer, class-action lawyers sued Intel, Gateway and Hewlett-Packard. The five plaintiffs named in court papers claimed to represent a class: everyone in the nation who had ever bought or leased a computer containing Intel's Pentium 4 processor, a group that may well include hundreds of thousands of people who have used new personal computers in the last two years. They said they had been misled into thinking that the chip performed better than earlier versions.
 Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman, disputed that and said the company would defend the case vigorously. 
 Although Intel and the other defendants are based in California, the lawyers chose to sue in Edwardsville, in Madison County, Ill. The county, in southwest Illinois near St. Louis, includes two cities of some 30,000 people each and is not known as a center of the high-tech economy. It is, though, the nation's leader in class-action filings on a per capita basis, according to a study published in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy.
The defendants tried to move the case to federal court. Last month, they were rebuffed by G. Patrick Murphy, a federal judge in Illinois, who said the individual claims were too small to allow him to hear the case.
Taken together, however, the amounts claimed may run into billions of dollars.
Under current law, federal courts may hear cases between residents of different states only if federal law is involved or if the amounts at issue exceed $75,000 for each plaintiff. In their legal papers, the plaintiffs said they sought less than $75,000 for each class member, apparently in an effort to stay out of federal court.
"This is contrived," said Mark H. Gitenstein, a Washington lawyer who represents the United States Chamber of Commerce, which backs legislation to let defendants move big interstate class actions to federal court. "These plaintiffs are in Illinois just for the purpose of getting this case in front of particular judges. They are forum shopping." He added, "Why should a county judge in Illinois be interpreting California law with respect to whether the Pentium 4 processor is faster than the Pentium III processor?"
Gordon R. Broom, a lawyer for Intel, said that limiting claims to $75,000 each might do a disservice to some clients. "Some governmental agency in Alabama or Idaho that bought a bunch of computers and wasn't aware of this class action and did not opt out may be limited to $75,000 in damages," he said. According to an affidavit filed by an Intel financial analyst, at least 40 customers in the United States purchased more than $1 million worth of Pentium 4 processors.
Brian Brooks, a Washington lawyer who is co-chairman of a Federalist Society committee on class actions, said that such "claims shaving" was pernicious. "Many people don't know that these class-action lawyers are affirmatively waiving claims that their clients might have for the lawyers' own advantage," he said. 
But Stephen M. Tillery, who represents the plaintiffs in the Intel suit, says federal courts are not friendly places. "The federal courts have historically been a lot harder on class certification," he said, and it is easier to appeal class-action filings in the federal courts.
Madison County judges are scrupulously fair, he added, and defendants are free to take appeals to higher courts in Illinois. 
Some federal judges have indicated their dissatisfaction with the current rules on when class actions may be moved from the state courts. In 1999, the federal appeals court in Atlanta apologized to General Motors as it sent a class action taking issue with G.M.'s service contracts back to the state courts of Alabama.
"We acknowledge that this case and its kin present an anomaly in our law," the court said. "An important historical justification for diversity jurisdiction is the reassurance of fairness and competence that a federal court can supply to an out-of-state defendant facing suit in state court."
CLASS-ACTION plaintiffs' lawyers choose their words carefully in describing Madison County.
"There is a balance between what we see in certain unduly conservative counties and what one might think is an unduly permissive jurisdiction," said Barbara Hart, a New York lawyer who represents plaintiffs in class actions. "Even as to certain cases in Illinois, there are appellate processes in place if defendants feel they have been 'hometowned.' "
Legislation passed by the House in March would have allowed Intel to transfer the case to federal court. The bill worries class-action plaintiffs' lawyers. Mr. Tillery said the bill, known as the Class Action Fairness Act, was misnamed. "The Republicans want to substantially curtail or eliminate class actions," he said.
But even John Coale, a plaintiffs' lawyer who generally opposes an overhaul of the tort system, said class actions were a special case. "The bills out there are not that bad," he said, speaking generally. "There are abusive class actions."

HEADLINE: An Iraq Strategy Short of War 

BYLINE:  By Richard S. Leghorn; Richard S. Leghorn, an Air Force reconnaissance commander in World War II, was involved with planning air and satellite surveillance and disarmament efforts during the cold war.

DATELINE: OSTERVILLE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Although Iraq has now said that it will accept the return of United Nations inspectors to search out weapons of mass destruction, it is unknown whether Saddam Hussein will comply fully with the rigorous inspection program mandated by the Security Council resolution.
 Under the terms of the resolution, if Iraq does not provide full disclosure of its weapons by Dec. 8, or if it should hinder the work of United Nations inspectors at any time, it will face "serious consequences." But the Security Council did not identify a specific enforcement mechanism acceptable to France, Russia and China. The only option on the table appears to be a major American-led war against Iraq. 
 The all-or-nothing approach of immediate war would risk the unwarranted loss of American and Iraqi lives and increased terrorism. It would also result in an enormous refugee problem; the destruction of Iraq's economic assets and infrastructure; the potential destabilization of other governments in the region; and a costly postwar occupation -- dependent primarily on American forces -- of uncertain duration and outcome.
There is a more sensible first response should Iraq fail to comply. The response could be based on intensive air and satellite inspection and openly volunteered intelligence information gathered from member nations. This would be followed with methodical and precise air strikes against credibly identified weapons of mass destruction.
The precedent for this type of approach was established in the cold war, when air and then satellite surveillance became the foundation of military deterrence. These forms of surveillance were both conceived after World War II as Stalin's Iron Curtain closed Communist societies. The information gained through surveillance was central to stabilizing the cold-war arms race. These strategies employed against Iraq now could be the basis for achieving the Security Council's objective of disarmament, and at significantly lower costs than invasion.
An effective alternative enforcement approach would include three elements. First, no-flight zones now applicable to northern and southern Iraq would be extended throughout the country, giving inspection aircraft full access to all areas. Any firing on such aircraft would constitute a "material breach" under the current United Nations resolution.
Second, member nations would be authorized to conduct air inspection by reconnaissance aircraft at any altitude. They should make the results of aerial surveillance and information gathered by military satellites fully available to United Nations inspection teams. This increased intelligence transparency would substantially buttress the Security Council resolution. Analysis and integration of such information from all government and nongovernment sources could lead to a credible assessment of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and the identification of targets for destruction.
Third, the Security Council would authorize precision aerial strikes by the United States and other nations against Iraqi targets if they are not destroyed on the ground voluntarily by Iraq or by United Nations inspectors. Instead of destruction by all-out war, this authorization would limit military action to achieve the limited objective of disarmament.
A program of intelligence transparency and surgical air strikes to take out weapons of mass destruction is more likely to win broad international support than immediate invasion. Of course, this option could always be followed by full-scale military attack should regime change become the only way to disarm Iraq, or if Iraq initiates any offensive action.
Unless there is prompt discussion and evaluation of alternative strategies, Iraq's noncompliance by Dec. 8 could trigger invasion and occupation. It would be foolhardy to move so precipitately before trying an approach that could well bring about disarmament in a quicker and more acceptable way.

HEADLINE: Ansley Johnson Coale, 84, Expert on Population Trends 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Ansley Johnson Coale, a demographer and former director of the Office of Population Research at Princeton University, died on Nov. 5 in Newtown, Pa. He was 84.
 Dr. Coale was an internationally recognized expert on population trends and the demographic statistics that document them. He directed the population center, an adjunct of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, from 1959 to 1976. 
 He introduced techniques that overcame some longstanding uncertainties that arose from estimates based on raw data. The new methodology helped in gauging factors like mortality and fertility in populations for which only inaccurate or incomplete numbers are available. 
In collaboration with William Brass, he refined the techniques in the book "Methods of Estimating Basic Demographic Measures from Incomplete Data" (written with Paul Demeny, 1967). 
Dr. Coale's first influential publication was "Population Growth and Economic Development in Low-Income Countries" (with Edgar Hoover, 1958). That was followed by "Regional Model Life Tables and Stable Populations" (with Mr. Demeny, 1966).
A native of Baltimore, Dr. Coale received his entire higher education at Princeton, graduating in 1939 in economics, earning his M.A. in 1941 and, after wartime service in the Navy, receiving a Ph.D. in 1947, the year he joined the faculty.
He was the author of scores of articles on various demographic topics and helped write additional textbooks on the growth and structure of human populations, fertility in Russia and the decline of fertility in Europe. 
At the time of his death, he was a professor emeritus of economics and the emeritus William Church professor of public affairs. 
Dr. Coale is survived by his wife of 61 years, Sarah Campbell Coale; two sons, Ansley Jr. and Robert C.; and three grandchildren.
President John F. Kennedy appointed Dr. Coale in 1961 to represent the United States on the Population Commission of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, which he did until 1967. 
Dr. Coale was also a past chairman of the committee on population and demography of the National Academy of Sciences, and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, which published his autobiography in 2000. He was a past president of the International Population Union.

HEADLINE: 3 Vying to Be South Korea's President Differ Over U.S. Ties 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
The top candidates in the presidential election next month have talked little about their policies. When they do drop the mask of reticence, however, wide differences emerge on the foreign policy issues that will define the nation, including South Korea's alliance with the United States. 
 One of the three leading candidates is the scion of the family that built the Hyundai industrial empire. Another is a pro-labor lawyer, former legislator and cabinet member from the president's party. The third, the acknowledged front-runner for the Dec. 19 election, is a conservative former prime minister and former chief justice. 
 Tensions have been rising sharply with North Korea, even though President Kim Dae Jung, who is barred by the Constitution from seeking a second five-year term, made reconciliation with the North a hallmark of his government. This is one of the matters on which the three candidates differ strongly, as interviews with them and their aides quickly made clear.
The chief opposition leader, and the leader in the main opinion polls, Lee Hoi Chang, favors a sharply harder line toward North Korea and close coordination with Washington. His two rivals favor continued dialogue with the North and express reservations, even flashes of resentment, toward American policy in the region. 
Mr. Lee, who narrowly lost to Mr. Kim five years ago, has been a consistent critic of the government's efforts to broaden political and economic ties with North Korea by doling out financial aid.
This week, the United States, Japan and South Korea worked out a joint position toward North Korea in response to its admission that it had been secretly developing nuclear weapons. With the Bush administration calling for penalties against North Korea. Mr. Lee's party said it would suspend aid until the North eliminated its weapons program. 
In a hint of the hardball a conservative victory would bring, Park Shin Il, an adviser to Mr. Lee, said that a Lee administration would quickly investigate reports that Mr. Kim's government secretly paid up to $400 million to North Korea to secure the landmark June 2000 summit meeting between Mr. Kim and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il. "Like it or not, once a new government is formed, there will be an investigation, and it may go as high as the president and his aides," Mr. Park said. "But it will be done fairly." 
Mr. Park criticized Chung Mong Joon, the Hyundai baron, as a man of little personal achievement, saying that in four terms as a legislator "he has never given a speech anyone can remember." Mr. Park added that the other rival candidate, Roh Moo Hyun, "would cater to radical interests, and is weak, unruly and vulnerable to North Korea." 
Mr. Chung and Mr. Roh, who both trail by about 10 points in opinion polls, have added drama to the race by discussing an alliance under which only one of them would stand against Mr. Lee. Nevertheless, Mr. Roh, who positions himself on the left of South Korea's political spectrum, and Mr. Chung, a centrist, take different approaches toward relations with North Korea and Washington.
The United States maintains 37,000 troops in South Korea as a tripwire to dissuade an attack by North Korea, and South Korea has long been a crucial element in American security strategy in East Asia. Various indicators, including opinion surveys, street demonstrations and even the lyrics of pop songs, however, have suggested a significant rise in anti-American sentiment here.
Although more conservative than Mr. Roh, Mr. Chung, who also served as the co-chairman of the committee that organized the World Cup soccer matches in South Korea, spoke more freely in an interview of his criticisms of the United States and of the other candidates.
He was especially critical of what he said was the United States' refusal to agree to joint investigations of American servicemen accused of crimes in South Korea. Washington, he said, had been "insensitive and irresponsible" about South Korean concerns, adding, "Sometimes we feel ignored." 
Mr. Chung accused Mr. Lee's supporters of manipulating tensions with North Korea in the last presidential election to win votes, calling that the "worst kind of crime by a politician." He suggested that Mr. Roh was too sympathetic toward North Korea. 
Although Mr. Chung criticized North Korea for "weakening the consensus" on aiding the country through its uranium enrichment program, he said South Korea should continue opening road and rail connections with the North and provide fuel oil as "humanitarian assistance." 
"The most important issue in Korea is the prevention of war," Mr. Chung said. "We have two million young Koreans with weapons, and the threat from the North is real. But in the long run, unification is our hope, and it must come in due process." 
Mr. Roh's campaign surged early only to fade amid growing political difficulties surrounding President Kim. Unlike his two rivals, Mr. Roh has never visited the United States. Pledging an open, more egalitarian government, he criticized his rivals for being "authoritarian, cold-war-type politicians." 
Speaking about policy toward North Korea, Mr. Roh said it was normal for South Korea to be more cautious than the United States. 
"Most dangerous would be a war, and second most dangerous is North Korea's economic collapse," Mr. Roh said. "You can use persuasion or pressure. Persuasion has higher costs at first, but pressure has higher risks. If it fails, you have war. 
"We should use both, but we should favor persuasion, especially since North Korea wants to open up its economy."

THE LANDSCAPE
OF HISTORY
How Historians Map the Past.
By John Lewis Gaddis.
Illustrated. 192 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press. $23.
Is the study of history a science? Can it become one? These questions have divided historians for over a century. The modern historical profession owes its birth, to a large degree, to the belief among late-19th-century historians -- most notably the great German scholar Leopold von Ranke -- that new scientific methods could liberate the study of history from opinion and prejudice, and put scholarship squarely on a foundation of unimpeachable fact. The almost simultaneous birth of the modern idea of ''social science'' contributed additional tools to the historical enterprise and reinforced the growing belief that history could take its place alongside the laboratory sciences as an objective search for truth. 
In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with the scholarly world awash in new theories challenging the very idea of truth, faith in the scientific character of historical study has been much more difficult to sustain. But according to John Lewis Gaddis, in this brief, provocative and intelligent examination of historical scholarship, historians have abandoned a belief in the scientific character of their work too quickly. They have done so, he argues, because they have used as their model the modern social sciences (economics, political science, sociology), when they should be forging connections with natural sciences (physics, geology, evolutionary biology and others).
Gaddis, who teaches at Yale, is the leading American chronicler of the cold war. But ''The Landscape of History,'' which had its origins in a series of lectures he recently gave at Oxford, is only passingly concerned with his own field of scholarship. It is, instead, a contribution to a very large body of work by historians analyzing their profession -- and a contribution with no small ambitions. Comparing his book with two of the classics of scholarly self-examination -- Marc Bloch's ''Historian's Craft'' and E. H. Carr's ''What Is History?'' -- Gaddis intends to provide a clear, perhaps even definitive answer to the question of the relationship between history and science.
The most striking element of this book may be Gaddis's sharp attack on some of the premises of the social sciences. Modern social science, he contends, is based on the belief that it is possible to explain events by searching for the ''independent variable,'' the ''element whose removal from a causal chain would alter the outcome.'' Such an approach requires that ''causes be ranked hierarchically'' so as to identify a single, central cause. But causes, he insists, cannot be neatly ranked. Every ''variable'' is dependent on others. Such analysis, he insists, is of little value to the understanding of the past and is of even less value to what social scientists claim they are doing, forecasting the future.
Gaddis is not entirely fair to social scientists here. There are many people working in political science, sociology, economics and other related disciplines who use approaches much less mechanical (and much more historical) than those he describes. Even the approaches he most disdains, among them rational choice theory, are considerably more sophisticated than he suggests. But in offering this critique, he does make clear one of the central differences between the way most social scientists and most historians work. On the one side is a search for simplicity, stability, predictability; on the other a search for complexity, contingency, particularity. Historians are notoriously poor at predicting events, but at least, Gaddis says, they make no claims to be able to do so. Social scientists produce elegant models but, he insists, models that are unconnected to the real world. And in the end, their predictions are no more reliable than anyone else's.
A better prototype for the way historians work, Gaddis argues, is those natural sciences that themselves attempt to explain great historical processes (the creation of the universe, the evolution of species, the shaping and reshaping of the natural world). ''These disciplines work,'' he says, not by imposing theories on events, but ''by deriving processes from structures, by fitting representations to realities, by privileging neither induction nor deduction, by remaining open . . . to what insights from one field can tell you about another.'' Historians have paid too little attention to these nonlaboratory natural sciences, Gaddis writes, but there are many unacknowledged similarities between the way they do their work and the way historians do theirs, and much that each can learn from the other.
Most of this book is less polemical than these central arguments make it sound. Gaddis offers a painstaking explanation of the way historians reach conclusions, the way they test their assumptions, the way they constantly revise their explanations. ''It's part of historical consciousness,'' he says, in an implicit rebuttal to conservative critics of historical revisionism, ''to learn . . . that there is no 'correct' interpretation of the past.''
The book reads at times a bit too much like the lectures from which it was drawn. There are too many parochial Oxford references, too many audience-friendly jokes, too much of the kind of repetition of argument that is valuable in the lecture hall or classroom but distracting in print. Yet whatever its shortcomings, this is also a bold and challenging book, unafraid of inviting controversy. It provides a strong statement for our time of both the limits and the value of the historical enterprise.

As Conflict Rises, So Do Gifts to Israel

BYLINE:  By DAVID TULLER 

 BODY:
MOLLY GOETZ is a longtime member of Hadassah, the American Jewish women's organization that has financed medical centers and other social service programs in Israel for decades. In the last two years, however, the unrelenting violence in the Middle East has so horrified Mrs. Goetz that she has stepped up her involvement with the group significantly.
 She became the president of her Hadassah chapter in Coconut Creek, Fla., and recently bought, at $200 each, lifetime memberships for her three daughters and three granddaughters. She has also pledged to give $1,000 a year toward Hadassah's goal of raising $45 million for a trauma center at its Jerusalem medical center, where many Jews and Palestinians injured in the conflict receive treatment. 
 "With everything going on over there, this trauma center is a must," said Mrs. Goetz, a retired executive secretary, who cut back on philanthropic giving unrelated to Israel so she could give more to Hadassah. "The situation has intensified my commitment. If American Jews don't help, then who will?"
Israel has always been a big beneficiary of the American Jewish community's financial support. Donations to projects and causes have routinely topped half a billion dollars a year, philanthropic leaders say. While the weak United States economy has cast a pall over much of the fund-raising world, the events in Israel have galvanized many American Jews to increase their levels of giving. But American Jews are also finding themselves in agonized debate over how Israel should confront its awesome conflicts. Their confusion and dismay have rippled across the philanthropic arena.
"In a time of crisis, there's enormous interest and a willingness to spend money, if people are convinced they can have an impact on the ground," said Mark Charendoff, president of the Jewish Funders Network, a New York-based organization of major American philanthropists from across the political and ideological spectrum. "But there's a frustration among a lot of donors as to what they should be giving to, and the answer is not as obvious as it might seem at first blush." 
Some people, including Mrs. Goetz, have decided to support relatively noncontroversial projects in areas like health care, economic development and education. Others donate to Israeli political parties. Many want their money to pay for security. Others say that now, more than ever, is the time to promote cooperative ventures between Jews and Arabs. 
A highly contentious question for many American donors is what should happen with the dozens and dozens of Jewish settlements that stud the occupied territories, the heart of any future Palestinian state. In Israel, the issue is so potent that the governing coalition fell apart last month in a dispute over financial support for the settlements. 
Last June, the United Jewish Communities, a leading American philanthropic group, reversed a longstanding policy, to support only projects within Israel's internationally recognized boundaries, and announced that it would finance some services for Jews living in the settlements. The move distressed those who feel that the settlements are an enormous obstacle to peace.
"The settlements are creating a festering wound and shouldn't receive any help at all," said Sheldon Greene, a Berkeley, Calif., lawyer and novelist who has long supported progressive Israeli causes.
The announcement of the policy change came in the middle of the Israel Emergency Campaign, a significant U.J.C. fund-raising drive for programs to help Israel cope with the violence, like additional security guards for schools, counseling and cash grants for victims of terror attacks and enhancement of emergency medical abilities. To date, the campaign has raised more than $320 million. That is on top of the $850 million the organization expects to raise this year through its regular charity campaign, about a third of which will support projects in Israel. 
The decision by United Jewish Communities to revise its financing guidelines months after the emergency campaign began caused headaches for some affiliates.
"We'd been raising money telling people one thing and then it changed." said Dawne Bear Novicoff, an official at the Jewish Community Federation in San Francisco.
After what participants said was an emotional debate, the local board in San Francisco voted that the $4.8 million raised in the area could be used to offer some assistance to individuals from the settlements.
Officials at United Jewish Communities defended the adoption of broader financing guidelines as a humanitarian gesture in a difficult time. The move should not be taken as an endorsement of the current Israeli government's settlement policy, they said.
"We clarified with our board that, in response to the emergency, we were going to provide humanitarian assistance for Jews wherever they live and are in trouble, with no geographical distinction," said Stephen Hoffman, president and chief executive of the organization. "We don't think that's a political decision. We think it's decency and compassion."
BUT opponents of the new policy, like Mr. Greene, say that any decision to change how a limited resource is allocated is a political decision. Although he makes a token donation each year to his local Jewish federation, Mr. Greene funnels most of his Israel-related giving through the New Israel Fund, a 23-year-old group he has been involved with since its founding. It supports causes like equal treatment for Israel's Arab minority, civil and human rights, environmental activism and religious pluralism.
"The last two years have shown that if you don't create a country in which all citizens have a stake, the security problems will only increase in the long run," said Jeremy Ben-Ami, a spokesman for the New Israel Fund. He said he expected the organization's fund-raising total to remain at around $24 million this year. 
At another point on the spectrum are American Jews who applauded the United Jewish Communities' decision as long overdue. "It was ridiculous that U.J.C. would support Jews all over the world, in Russia and India and Germany, but wouldn't support Jews who lived in the biblical homeland," said Andrew Goldsmith, executive vice president of the One Israel Fund, which was established in 1994 to raise money to improve life in the settlements.
In 1999, the One Israel Fund raised $1.5 million from about 3,500 donors, Mr. Goldsmith said. This year, he added, its projected total is more than $4 million from a donor base of 8,000 individuals.
The spending pattern has also changed, he said. Two years ago, the organization focused on community centers, libraries and other amenities of daily life. Now, the bulk of the money goes toward bulletproof vests, better fences, patrol vehicles and other security-related items.
"We long for the day when we can fund day-care centers," Mr. Goldsmith said.

City of Enron Carries On, Battered but Unbowed

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
THE teal-colored Star of Hope building, a few blocks from this city's state-of-the-art downtown baseball stadium, could be called a state-of-the-art homeless shelter. It has a dormitory with 100 bunk beds for transient men and long-term housing for men taking classes on subjects like preventing substance abuse or finding a job. It even has a computer room.
 Just as the stadium, christened Enron Field, is an emblem of the prosperity that Houston enjoyed in the 1990's, the shelter is evidence of the philanthropic generosity that was also common. The $8 million shelter was built with donations, including many from employees of Enron, the energy company that paid $100 million for the naming rights on the stadium. 
 As that bubble of prosperity has popped, especially with the collapse of energy companies like Enron, nonprofit institutions like the Star of Hope are also hurting. Kathy Tabor, director of development for Star of Hope, said fund-raising had become so difficult the organization has frozen hiring and is selling Christmas teddy bears to help meet its budget for its three shelters.
"We're losing the income, and our business, so to speak, is increasing," Mrs. Tabor said, adding that the number of homeless men needing help has risen 49 percent in the last two years. The downtown shelter is already overflowing.
Throughout the city, nonprofit organizations, arts groups and other entities that depend on charitable largess are worried. Fund-raisers continue to preach optimism, saying that Houston remains a generous city with a tradition of philanthropy. 
But even as the overall Houston economy is showing resilience, the city has taken hard blows. First came the flooding of tropical storm Allison. Then came the bankruptcy filing of Enron and the growing troubles of other energy companies. Finally, toss in the stock market slump. 
Meanwhile, the fund-raising community is facing the fact that many Houston residents have focused their giving on causes related to Sept. 11.
"My impression would be that Houston, from the charitable perspective, has to be one of the hardest hit places in the country," said David Nelson, vice president and grant director for the Houston Endowment, which, depending on the rise or fall of the market, is the largest philanthropic endowment in the city.
The condition of the Houston Endowment and other philanthropic funds helps explain one facet of the problem. Mr. Nelson said that the value of the endowment has dropped to about $1.3 billion from $1.6 billion in the fall of 2000. This means that the endowment, which annually awards grants totaling 5 percent of its value, will award about $60 million rather than $75 million. Other foundations are in the same situation. Dr. Billy C. Ward, president of the Swalm Foundation, said about 12 of 50 monthly grant applications now receive money. In the past, about 20 received money.
Mr. Nelson said the number of grant recipients was going down as demand was increasing, in part because corporate support is less. He cited Enron as an example; the company has $40 million in unmet charitable commitments, he said. "When they come to us and ask for more money," Mr. Nelson said of grant applicants, "they say they are not getting the corporate support they are used to."
Paul Comstock, a financial adviser and a former president of the National Committee on Planned Giving, said some philanthropists here are nervous after watching their stock holdings diminish in value. He said that a number of philanthropic family foundations were formed in Houston in the 1990's, as a way for successive generations to come together to make a joint gift. 
But many family foundations, Mr. Comstock said, were still being endowed and would not give significant grants for several years. Some funds have suffered in the stock market. Meanwhile, he said, wealthy individual clients are being far more careful, and more focused, on how much money to give and to whom.
"The clients we work with, while they are still wealthy by most standards, their sense of their wealth is different," Mr. Comstock said. "They are feeling vulnerable. If the market goes on another year of low returns, it's going to really start impacting."
Randy Penn, director of institutional giving for the Houston Ballet, is particularly concerned. More than most organizations, the ballet has suffered from the recent economic hits to the city. In the summer of 2001, the ballet had $200,000 in costumes damaged from flooding by tropical storm Allison. In December, the ballet took a loss when a $15,000 check from Enron was returned after the company filed for bankruptcy protection. 
The ballet generates more than a third of its annual budget from fund-raising, but Mr. Penn said that some longtime donors are talking about no longer giving to the arts.
"We don't know what to expect yet," he said. "We're getting some signals from corporations suggesting they are turning toward more basic education." Mr. Penn said he reminded donors of the many programs the ballet sponsors with public schools, but he was worried that some donors might see the organization as less worthy of help in tighter economic times.
Only last month, Robert E. Corder gave a presentation to the local chapter of the Association of Fund-Raising Professionals titled "Troubled Times and Anxious Markets: Don't Back Off." Mr. Corder, the principal of The Dini Partners, which provides counseling on philanthropic and nonprofit giving, said his message was that fund-raisers need to work smarter and harder, but that obtaining money was still an attainable goal.
"There's cautious optimism," Mr. Corder said. "We're continuing to see, even in these markets, money being given away."
He said that the regional council of the Boy Scouts of America recently raised $20 million. Mr. Corder said that successful campaigns would depend on a focused message and hard work. Mrs. Tabor of Star of Hope agreed. "There is still money there," she said. "They are just afraid to give it right now. They are just wanting to see what will happen with the economy."
Vicki LaRue, chief executive of Camp for All, a program for children and adults with chronic illnesses and disabilities, needed to raise $1 million this year. She has made certain not to lean lean too heavily on any one donor, and instead draws 40 percent of her financing from foundations; 40 percent from individuals; and 20 percent from corporations. She said the camp watched its pennies but it would make its budget. 
The future, however, looks more uncertain, she said, particularly if the stock market does not rebound. But like a true Houstonian, she added: "Houston is not a city that ever gets down. We're cautiously optimistic."

HEADLINE: MARKETING; 
After the Non-Revolution, Nonprofits Tiptoe Online

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
THE American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals knows a lot about its members and donors when it sends out its electronic newsletters -- and uses that knowledge. Thanks to a heavy investment in new technology, the organization can sort and customize the e-mail letters by location, sex, profession and other categories. Jo Sullivan, the group's senior director for direct marketing, says that at the moment, though, the group is focused on one distinction: "I'm segmenting cat owners versus dog owners," she said.
 Those who love cats get a cat image on the front of the electronic newsletters, while dog lovers get their preference. 
 The personal touch is an example of how technology can help a nonprofit organization. It sounds like a small thing, but many nonprofit groups, like their counterparts in the profit-seeking world, have realized that small things can make a difference, and that it was the big promises that proved to be the least likely to materialize. 
During the high-technology boom Ms. Sullivan and other executives of nonprofit groups received pitch after pitch from companies that said they could transform donor recruiting, direct mail and donations. Predictions that "your Web site is going to make you a million dollars!" were common. 
Although Ms. Sullivan thinks that technology will eventually have an impact in her field, she has gained a measure of skepticism, like so many other executives of nonprofits, for-profits and wish-they-had profits. "Just because you've built a better Web site doesn't mean people are going to flock to it and throw money at you," she said.
Like the dot-coms, the first wave of companies that were formed to revolutionize the nonprofit world boomed, and then busted. "The euphoria of the explosive birth has now given way to the cold realities of the shakeout stage," said James Austin, a professor at Harvard Business School who studies nonprofit organizations. Of more than 300 new Internet enterprises that were developed since the late 1990's to help nonprofits receive donations, find volunteers or provide them with other services, "about 17 percent have folded and many others are barely holding on," he said. 
SIMILARLY, another force that seemed to have the potential to revolutionize fund-raising has turned out to have smaller, but real, consequences: the wave of Internet-based donations after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. "The importance of the 9/11 giving was that it demonstrated the power of online giving to mobilize funds, particularly in emergency situations," Professor Austin said. 
Taking that potential and helping the nonprofit sector to deal more efficiently with online giving poses the next challenge for the companies serving nonprofits, he said. Now, he added, "Online giving will continue to grow in importance, albeit at a slower pace than had originally been expected."
Part of that slowdown is connected to the slow economy. But much of it has to do with what in retrospect was a mismatch between venture-capital-driven dot-coms and the nonprofit organizations they were trying to work with. The nonprofits were slow to adopt new methods, loath to share information about their donor lists and suspicious of the commercial newcomers, many of whom hoped to take a slice of each donation they processed. 
America's Second Harvest learned the hard way about the difficulties of technology. Three years ago, the organization announced an initiative that would allow the group, which takes food donations mainly from corporations and distributes them to food banks nationwide, to computerize its supply chain much the way major manufacturers do, and to integrate its electronic systems with those of its donors for seamless communication and donations.
The payoff would come in efficiency and less spoilage. But a partnership with Hewlett-Packard to develop the technology fizzled as the enormous undertaking grew increasingly expensive. "Before we got very far, we had to start over," said David Prendergast, vice president for technology at America's Second Harvest.
The nonprofit now works with AidMatrix, a spinoff of the i2 Foundation, on a system that it will roll out in December (i2 provides supply-chain-management software to businesses). Mr. Prendergast said the experience had been painful but instructive. "Three years and thousands of hours later, we're getting ready to put something out that may actually do that," he said. "But it's not simple."
Perhaps the most important lesson for nonprofits, they say, is what companies have learned: clicks must be integrated with bricks. Online giving is still a tiny percentage of giving overall, but donors now expect to find and be able to use the online arm of a nonprofit organization. Just as shoppers might browse styles at a site for Victoria's Secret but buy from a catalog, donors might want the Web site to offer information on the causes they are interested in and the ability to donate.
And the Internet is paying off for nonprofits in many ways that have already proved useful to businesses. E-mail is much cheaper, for example, than direct mail, and so the A.S.P.C.A. can reach far more members and donors than ever before. Instead of communicating with 40,000 people week to week for fund-raising and advocacy, it can reach 250,000 with little additional cost. 
And the ability of computers to sift through vast data and cut through inefficient marketsis showing promise.
The Network for Good, which calls itself an e-philanthropy portal, connects donors and volunteers with nonprofit groups. It was created last year by AOL Time Warner, Cisco Systems and Yahoo. Set up as a nonprofit, the network tries to pick up transactional costs as part of its operating costs, giving donors the ability to pay those costs -- usually a few dollars -- themselves. Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for the AOL Time Warner Foundation, said that 35 percent of donors now paid the transactional costs, too. For the last six months, the site has attracted $1 million a month in donations, he said. 
"We have definitely benefited from the failures of some of the folks who have come before us," said Ken Weber, acting president and chief operating officer of Network for Good.

HEADLINE: Finding a Way to Keep It All Going 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: EL PASO 

 BODY:
ONE sunny day in late October, Las Americas, a nonprofit organization that represents detained children and others in trouble with immigration authorities here, had $958.78 in its checking account, about enough to pay one month's salaries and taxes.
 True, it had another $8,752.88 in its "investment" account, but that wasn't enough to cover the annual costs of its auditor and bookkeeper, let alone its $306,065 annual budget. 
 Fourteen foundations and religious organizations have turned down Las America's grant requests this year, some of whom were steady supporters in the past, and others gave only half of what they gave last year.
"It's tough," said Sister Liliane Alam, the charity's executive director, summing up the fund-raising environment nationwide this year.
From organizations like Las Americas that operate on a shoestring even in the most robust economic environments, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which has a $1.8 billion endowment to cushion it from swings in the fortunes of its well-heeled patrons, the nonprofit world is reeling. 
Last year, the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon threw off fund-raising efforts and diverted philanthropic dollars to relief and related causes, so many organizations began the year at a disadvantage. 
Now, wealthy donors hurt by the stock market are renegotiating their pledges. Foundations have also lost money to the market, and corporations are having trouble justifying investments in charity when they cannot afford to pay their shareholders dividends. City and other local governments faced with yawning deficits are cutting their budgets.
"I have never seen anything like this," said Fran Barrett, who has worked in the nonprofit world since 1969 and is executive director of Community Resource Exchange, a nonprofit organization that advises its nonprofit clients on management, budgets, how to build boards and other administrative matters. "Usually, when one well runs dry, you can run to another and the only question is whether you're quick enough to where the money is. The money isn't anywhere now."
Ms. Barrett said the hard times might continue for three or four more years. But those who work in charity, naturally an optimistic bunch, insist on seeing a silver lining in the black clouds. "It forces you to prioritize and refocus," said Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, senior vice president at the United Way in New York City. "That discipline is very healthy."
Around the country, organizations are working hard to turn lemons into lemonade in the most likely and unlikely ways. Most charities will not experience the kind of discipline that is required at Las Americas. Some of its volunteers from the Border Volunteer Service, a division of AmeriCorps, are supposed to receive a small salary from Las Americas, but Sister Liliane often asks them if their families can help tide them over until another grant check arrives or a religious order sends a check.
Las Americas is housed in a ramshackle building in a ramshackle neighborhood in El Paso, one of the country's poorest cities. There is no heat or air-conditioning, and so much plaster has fallen off the walls the lath shows through in places.
Last month, Sister Liliane was celebrating a gift of a desk and two chairs contributed by a travel agency that was going out of business. It meant that Jenny Dragseth, a volunteer who helps female victims of domestic violence gain legal status here, no longer has to work at a children's table propped up on cinder blocks. 
"I have never worked in such a poor, mean area as here on the border," said Sister Liliane, a native Lebanese whose order, the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary, has sent her to Egypt, Morocco and New York City.
She came here in January to overhaul Las Americas' fund-raising, which dropped precipitously after the terrorist attacks. "Immigrants today are like lepers during St. Francis's time," she said. "No one is giving money for immigrants." So she started by knocking the word "immigrant" out of the organization's name. 
She then transformed its annual spaghetti dinner -- "This is not a fund-raiser, it's a church social," she sniffed -- into a benefit honoring two local immigrant advocates. Tickets were $15 to $100, and she sent them to everyone she knew. "I told my friends in New York that they had to send $250 because that's the least you can pay for a benefit there," she said.
The event raised $13,000 after expenses, and 164 people attended, many of them leading figures in El Paso's legal community. That was almost double what the spaghetti supper raised but fell short of the $40,000 Sister Liliane had hoped for.
She has also reached out to previously untapped foundations and new donors, with mixed success. Las Americas has secured pledges for $102,650 for the fiscal year that ends June 30 and has requested a total of $436,000 from 15 foundations and religious groups. "I am also working to build our board to add more people who can help us raise money," Sister Liliane said.
She will need all the help she can get. Just last week, the landlord told her he was selling the house to a law firm that wants to build offices on the site, which will be just down the street from a new courthouse. "This problem I will leave to God," she said. "But you know, it does give us the chance to offer naming rights to anyone who might want to buy us a building."

Princeton
 At the other end of the fund-raising spectrum are the country's universities, which shrewdly capitalized on the biggest postwar economic boom to build fat, no, obese endowments. Universities have turned fund-raising into a competitive sport, using their endowments to measure their success much the way bonuses determine the pecking order among investment bankers.
At Princeton University, income thrown off by its $8.1 billion endowment accounts for 40 percent of the budget; the endowment was up last year by 2.2 percent, in spite of the falling stock market.
Giving makes up a much smaller but increasingly important source of income. Last year, Princeton's annual fund was basically flat at $36.4 million, compared with $36.7 million the previous year.
"The cost of higher education has increased because of competition, but government is certainly not increasing its support, most schools have seen their endowments decline, and tuition has already gone up, up, up, up," said Brian J. McDonald, vice president for development at Princeton. "If you look at the various sources of revenue and say what can we grow, fund-raising looks like the most likely candidate."
So Princeton is enlisting its faculty in its fund-raising efforts, allowing teachers to pitch their pet projects to alumni. Robert Wuthnow, a sociology professor, told a group in New York about his efforts to build the Center for the Study of Religion, for instance. Mr. McDonald also said that Princeton had sent Maria Klawe, the new head of the engineering school, to San Francisco to meet with alumni. 
"The appetite for these sessions is enormous," Mr. McDonald said. "It engages our alumni intellectually and reminds them in a very tangible way of our mission."
The university also still encourages donors to contribute stock. "For many of our top donors, their preferred gift currency, namely appreciated stock, is not as highly valued as it was two years ago, but we believe that the economy is now at or very close to its bottom," Mr. McDonald said. "That currency will appreciate in the years to come, so it's a great advantage to them and to us to be patient."

Children's Art Project
 Not all charities rely on donors to keep them afloat. Increasingly, charities are building revenue streams that mimic business models to bring more stability to their finances.
The Children's Art Project at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston is a nonprofit that operates like a business except that all the profits are used on programs for the children who are undergoing treatment there. 
One unintended side-effect of the commercial models is that it subjects the charities to the same business cycles that businesses experience. "We have to pay for products and services like anyone else," said Shannan A. Murray, the director. "We have 26 staff people who need to be paid, as well as accountants and production people."
The project takes artwork that is created by the children in treatment and turns it into holiday cards, umbrellas, notepads and jewelry that is then sold through catalogs and online. Roughly 83 percent of its sales are made from August through December, and last year, the terrorists struck a week after the project mailed its first catalog.
A month later, one week after it sent out a second catalog, the anthrax scare made customers wary of the mail.
Ms. Murray quickly dropped plans for a smaller catalog in the spring, halted third and fourth printings of cards and cut expenses. "We did everything from not ordering paper to not ordering a new printer," Ms. Murray said. "We had to make a minimum of $1.5 million to fund the programs we back at the hospital."
The project cut $1 million in expenses to offset the $1 million decline in revenues, but this year it is harder to see where the cuts will be made. At the last minute, the company that had agreed to underwrite the cost of T-shirts to be given to the group's volunteers during a kickoff rally last month backed out.
The group also needed a new computer system to replace one that is 12 years old, so it has taken out a loan. "It's part of a five-year-business plan," Ms. Murray said. "I thought about trying to find a donor or an underwriter, but no one really wants to underwrite a back-office system for a small nonprofit."

The Public Theater
 When the planes hit the World Trade Center, the Public Theater/New York Shakespeare Festival in Manhattan was already on the brink. Big losses on two Broadway productions eroded its endowment by 42 percent; two big donors had left its board and it was projecting deficits through its 2004 fiscal year.
To deal with those problems, the theater eliminated 20 positions and one of its two hallmark summer performances in Central Park. Mara Manus, the theater's new executive director, said neither the jobs nor the performance would return soon, thanks to the weak fund-raising environment. "We can't afford any more belt tightening," Ms. Manus said.
Had the production "Take Me Out" not been such a success, earning eight additional weeks of performances, the Public would have had to cut a production this year.
Like executives at many nonprofit groups, Ms. Manus is trying to identify and mine the assets the theater has, particularly its immensely popular "Shakespeare in the Park" productions.
A sponsorship arrangement, in which $100 buys a seat at one of the Shakespeare productions, has been a good way to increase support from individual donors. Though the Public has long offered this program, it has never aggressively exploited it. Last year, Ms. Manus said, $300,000 in revenues were earned from sponsors. Next summer, she said, "I'm hoping we can get 6,000 sponsorships from individuals," or about $600,000. Corporate sponsors will also be solicited. 
The Public is also planning to add a series of intimate, opening night benefits to its party schedule, which until now consisted of one annual gala. "It's a bit of a rub for the production staff and the actors because opening night festivities are traditionally reserved for their families, but tough times call for these sorts of things," Ms. Manus said.
She also said that the Public was trying to add more glamour to its gala by recruiting more star power.
New York City contributes roughly 10 percent of the theater's $10 million annual operating budget, but Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's office has already said that government cutbacks in fiscal 2004 will be more severe than those already meted out. "I have told our board that we need to build a $200,000 surplus into our budget to create a reserve fund for all of the things we can't foresee," she said. 
The Public is also considering raising ticket prices and membership rates, a tactic that is increasingly popular among cultural institutions. The American Museum of Natural History, for instance, has urged members to renew their memberships because rates are about to increase.
"I don't have too many concerns about doing that because we're very competitively priced," Ms. Manus said. "Our tickets are cheap compared to others."

Habitat for Humanity
 Habitat for Humanity International, the charity championed by former President Jimmy Carter for its efforts to build housing for the poor, is pursuing a contrary strategy: it is hiring staff members rather than laying off employees.
Specifically, it has hired nine more people to solicit major gifts of $5,000 or more a year, and three more people to support them. Anthony J. DiSpigno, senior vice president for resource development, plans to build the major gifts team at Habitat to 50 people by 2005.
"We have decided we have to move up the ladder in terms of how we communicate with our donors," he said. "We have to talk more to our donors and make them more a part of the process, get them involved with the cause they're supporting, and they will respond."
Habitat relies heavily on fund-raising. In the year that ended June 30, almost 77 percent of its $193 million budget came from Mr. DiSpigno's operation.
In the past, direct marketing has been its biggest source of revenues. But more donors are demanding a relationship with the charities they support, and postage costs have increased.
Mr. DiSpigno said that having the additional fund-raising staff had actually helped lower costs. "Direct marketing is relatively more expensive than the staff, and it has stayed pretty flat," he said. "Because of the size of gifts you're able to get with a major gifts staff, they bring down the costs."
Habitat did not lose ground in its last fiscal year, but revenues stayed flat. So far this year, Mr. DiSpigno said, contributions are on track to rise 7.5 percent, a jump he attributes to the new employees.
Habitat has also been working harder to cultivate corporate donors, which are increasingly looking for ways to get their employees involved in volunteer work. It recently bought a full-page ad in USA Today acknowledging its corporate partners, and has started appealing to the marketing and public relations arms of companies, instead of just to corporate foundations.
"Our brand is quite valuable, somewhere between Starbucks and FedEx," Mr. DiSpigno said. "You can make a good case that association with us is good for business, so we're not just relying on one pocket."

When the Chef's in School, Students Start Cooking

BYLINE:  By DONNA WILKINSON 

 BODY:
NAME: Careers Through Culinary Arts Program. 
FOUNDED: 1990, by Richard Grausman in New York City.
 MISSION: To promote and provide career opportunities in the culinary arts for inner-city youth through education and apprenticeship. In partnership with the public schools, business and professional culinary organizations, C-CAP, as it is known, offers training, mentoring, career counseling, scholarships and job placement. 
 CONSTITUENCY: Students in more than 200 middle and high schools in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington, Tidewater, Va., and Arizona. Every year about 10,000 students participate in C-CAP.
FINANCING: The $1.4 million annual budget comes from corporations, foundations, private donors and scholarships from culinary schools -- the Culinary Institute of America, Johnson & Wales University, Le Cordon Bleu Schools, the Art Institutes and the New England Culinary Institute. 
The idea for C-CAP was sparked in 1989, when Mr. Grausman was listening to a speech at a culinary conference. An executive with a major food company was "predicting the age of cookless kitchens, microwaves in automobiles, people not sitting down at the table together, and I thought if this is the future, it's very depressing," said Mr. Grausman, a former teacher for the Parisian cooking school Le Cordon Bleu and a cookbook author.
Fast forward to the spring of 1990. "One morning in the shower a question came to me," he said. "What could I do to change that forecast? The answer was to get into the schools."
That fall Mr. Grausman started a program in 12 public high schools in New York City, initially to teach French cooking in home-economics classes. But it immediately became clear that most of his students needed more than recipes. "Some couldn't read or were working way below age level," he said. "And when I'd ask them what they were going to do after high school, they didn't know."
He realized that a potentially rich talent pool was slipping through the cracks. "When some of these students cooked, they were electrified," he said. "I'd say to them, 'Have you thought of this as a career?' And they'd say, 'You mean cooking? Can I do that?' "
The program soon shifted to career training. C-CAP not only teaches classic cooking techniques but also skills like how to use knives. And it emphasizes the importance of professional work habits: showing up on time, being part of a kitchen team and having the right attitude. The program also offers students academic counseling and support.
Mr. Grausman mobilized many top chefs to act as mentors and to provide apprenticeships in their restaurants to talented students. The advisory board is peppered with names like Jacques Pepin; Anne Rosenzweig, the executive chef of Arcadia; and Marcus Samuelsson, the executive chef of Aquavit. 
The program holds annual cooking competitions in which students can win scholarships to elite culinary schools. Judged by professional chefs, the competitions are showcases that can also lead to prestigious jobs. "The chefs see the ability of these kids, and they're extremely impressed," Mr. Grausman said.
In its 12-year history, the organization has awarded more than $9 million in scholarships -- and many alumni are rising stars. Mr. Grausman, who was given the President's Service Award for volunteer service in 1997, is currently developing an after-school pilot program in Boston and is hoping to introduce C-CAP in elementary schools.
"Food service has always been part of the minority community but not necessarily on an executive chef or owner level," said Mr. Samuelsson. "But all you need is a foot in the door. The reason I support Richard is that he's giving students that opportunity. And that's all you can ask for."

HEADLINE: THE ENVIRONMENT; 
Looking For Messes That Are Easy to Fix

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
ENVIRONMENTAL threats often have an overwhelming sweep that can paralyze people eager to help. When considering toxic waste in Asia, fouled water in Africa, radioactive landscapes in Russia, where do you start?
 In the face of such vast issues, Richard Fuller, a successful recycling and energy-use consultant to American companies, decided a few years ago to start small, very small. He sought grants and diverted some assets of his business, Great Forest, into creating the Blacksmith Institute, a vest-pocket nonprofit that scours the world's toxic spots for clearly defined and fixable pollution problems. 
 Mr. Fuller says he is unapologetic about looking for the simpler kinds of challenges, mainly because there are so many, and because many hide in plain sight with no one doing anything to clean them up.
There is the slaughterhouse in downtown Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which is the source of 80 percent of the waste rendering the Msimbazi River nearby toxic and infectious. There are the sprawling dumps in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where infectious hospital waste mingles with trash that is scavenged by flocks of poor children.
Then there is Kabwe, a city of 250,000 that grew up around a century-old lead smelter and is so contaminated that many neighborhoods would qualify many times over as Superfund sites, if they were located in Illinois instead of Zambia.
Although the smelter closed in 1994, residents still excavate the dusty earth by hand to get at residual seams of the neurotoxic metal. Some schoolyards contain mineable concentrations. Thousands of people have blood-lead levels many times higher than the American limit.
IT was pressure from Blacksmith that prompted the Zambian government to agree to include Kabwe in a list of mining sites it plans to clean up under a pending $40- to $50-million loan from the World Bank, officials of the bank said.
Initially, the cleanup was focused on the opposite side of the country, in a copper-mining region. Kabwe's problems had been identified, but government officials had tried to play down the dangers for years, reports by the Blacksmith Institute said.
The institute's involvement as an independent force brought the issue of including Kabwe on the list to a close, said Yves Andre Prevost, senior environment specialist in the bank's Africa region environment group.
"The bank is not in a position to take an issue and bring it to public attention," he said. "The fact that Blacksmith identified the issue and started doing things about it comforted us, and allowed us to tell the government you can't run away from this one."
Mr. Prevost said that Blacksmith had shown a knack for identifying local partners who can pinpoint pollution problems and devise possible solutions. Blacksmith can also raise money and channel it where it can do the most good, he said.
Mr. Fuller appears to be determined not to waste money, Mr. Prevost said. "In Kabwe, there was some consultant offering his services for something like $300 a day," he said, and Mr. Fuller said, "get lost." 
The annual budget for Blacksmith's projects has grown to about $400,000, an amount that pales beside the budgets of groups like the Nature Conservancy or the National Wildlife Federation. Mr. Fuller, a youthful 42-year-old Australian, operates Great Forest and Blacksmith out of a 29th-floor office on Park Avenue in New York (www.blacksmithinstitute.org).
The other full-time employee is Sara Kate Gillingham, who until recently was writing grants for urban agriculture projects in places like Yonkers, and now spends her time inspecting toxic dumps in Maputo, Mozambique.
The group's small size has led to remarkable agility, as are Mr. Fuller's entrepreneurial instincts, said Frances Beinecke, who advised Mr. Fuller when he was establishing his group and is the executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, the influential American environmental organization.
"We'd have to have a multiyear plan and figure out how to have a long-term impact," Ms. Beinecke said. "He finds a sewage problem or a lead problem somewhere and cobbles together resources from here and there, and in developing countries it makes a big difference."
Ms. Beinecke also noted that Mr. Fuller's focus was on toxic pollution even though most American conservation groups, when working overseas, stress saving species or ecosystems.
Usually, Blacksmith finds ways to support a particular official in a local government agency that is responsible for cleanups but lacks the ability to get the job done. 
SOMETIMES, the support is as basic as a retainer of $200 a month for local contacts who act as coordinators for pollution surveys or other projects. In many countries, this can easily be enough to double someone's income, Mr. Fuller said.
In places like Cambodia, where the government has not yet mandated environmental laws, Mr. Fuller and his staff -- one full-time development expert, several part-timers and volunteers -- draft legislation.
Last year, the group conducted the first thorough survey of Phnom Penh hospitals and clinics to determine what they do with their hazardous waste. Blacksmith is now working with government officials to outline legislation to control the flow.
In places where there is little hope of working effectively with a government, Blacksmith finds a local nonprofit group or helps to establish one, often a person with a telephone and a computer.
In Dar es Salaam, the contact is a collection of environmental engineering school graduates who found the unfiltered streams of blood and offal flowing from the slaughterhouse into the Msimbazi River.
These are not green activists waving placards, Mr. Fuller said. They have a specific design, right down to the size of the necessary pipes, he added. Plans are under way for a $70,000 loan to build a treatment plant for the slaughterhouse, Mr. Fuller said.
As more of Blacksmith's projects move from planning to concrete cleanups, Mr. Prevost said, it is becoming evident that the group's technique could be applied widely.
What is also clear, Mr. Fuller said, is that many hot spots remain. His next destination is Siberia, where towns near former factories that generated plutonium during the cold war were contaminated with traces of radioactive materials.
He will be heading there next month to assess the situation. So far, Mr. Fuller said, he has always solved these seemingly intractable problems.
"You get a punch list of things that need to happen some place until we can tick it off and say its pollution problems are solved," he said, adding that the goal is to "be reasonably sure kids can be born without the risk of getting really sick or dying young."

Hungry Mouths Growing, But Not the Donations

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ 

 BODY:
EVEN with the kind of cold that scrubs the lungs, the line outside Church of the Holy Apostles' soup kitchen Chelsea begins to form over an hour before the first plate of hot beef stew will be served. 
 Kinneth Simms, 39, stood in line for the first time about a month ago. He had lost his job as a truck driver and carried with him a folded piece of paper with a list of jobs. "I'm just trying to get any little type of job they will give me, even Wendy's," he said. 
 Last year, Holy Apostles served an average of 1,070 meals a day. For the last three months, it has served more than 1,200 a day. "It is a leading indicator of something," said the Rev. William Greenlaw, executive director of the soup kitchen. "I am not an economist, but I've learned in the 19 years I have been here that we see things early."
After the Sept. 11 attacks, demand at soup kitchens and food pantries in New York City rose. The attacks prompted an outpouring of giving, which benefited many hunger-relief groups. But the blush of patriotism and community feeling has been replaced by economic insecurity. Donations, many charities say, are not keeping pace with demand, an imbalance that in some cases has led to rationing and turning people away. 
Several factors, including the recession that began in 2001 and restrictions on welfare, have added to the problem, said people who work for relief organizations. Unemployment in New York City was 7.8 percent in October, higher than the national average of 5.7 percent. Unemployment benefits have started to run out for New Yorkers who lost their jobs after the attacks. And cuts in government assistance and the low use of food stamps have increased the dependence of food programs on private donations, just as giving has softened.
Experts say that New York City, where an estimated 1.5 million people received food assistance last year, is bad but not out of the ordinary. Nationally, about 33 million Americans do not have enough food, and hubs of business travel, like Chicago, and tourism, like Florida, have been hit hard because of job losses related to those sectors, said America's Second Harvest, a network of nonprofit food banks that provides most of the food distributed by charities. The association said 80 percent of its affiliates reported increased demand this year.
According to the Food Bank for New York City, requests for emergency food assistance in New York rose after Sept. 11 and have remained robust, with 69 percent of soup kitchens and 77 percent of food pantries reporting significantly increased demand last spring.
But the Human Resources Administration, the agency that helps finance 610, about half, of the city's soup kitchens and food pantries, paints a slightly different picture. A spokesman, David Neustadt, said that the average number of visits a month to food pantries (which give groceries to families) increased 20 percent after the terrorist attacks but soon fell to below pre-Sept. 11 levels. According to the H.R.A. statistics, the number of meals served at soup kitchens increased only gradually after the attacks and decreased in August.
"The advocates are talking about demand as judged by food-service providers, while the city is talking about number of people served," said Lawrence M. Mead, a professor of politics at New York University and a specialist on urban poverty. "There could be an increase in demand seen by administrators that is not reflected in how many people are served" because they are turned away.
City Harvest, a food-relief program, found that after the attacks, two-thirds of the agencies they supplied had shortages. In May, 26 percent reported shortages. 
New Directions, a food pantry in Staten Island, turned away 45 families in October, said the executive director, Wendy De Shong-Neuhalfen. St. John's Bread and Life Soup Kitchen in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brookyn, which sometimes reduces portions to meet demand, served 27 percent more meals in the last four months than in the same period last year. The Yorkville Common Pantry in East Harlem, which has had a 32 percent increase in meal distribution in the first 10 months, is contemplating turning people away, the executive director, Jeff Ambers, said. 
PEOPLE operating food services point to another change: they say some people, including many employed at low-wage or part-time jobs, are going to food pantries and soup kitchens not just because they are in a crisis but because they need a long-term source. In 1997, half the people who called City Harvest's Hunger Hotline for referrals were first-time callers, the executive director of City Harvest, Julia Erickson, said. Now, only 25 percent are first-time callers. 
"It's not about a hunger emergency, it's about chronic hunger," said Nancy Mahon, executive director of God's Love We Deliver, which provides meals to people with AIDS and other illnesses. 
At the Food Bank, which distributed 20 percent more food in the year that ended in June than it did the year before, individual giving fell by about a third after the attacks and has not recovered. Even charities that received more money after 9/11 fear that donations will not continue to come in. 
As giving softens, several factors have made charities more dependent on private donations. Improved food manufacturing has cut down on in-kind donations, and consolidation in the industry means that charities must often transport donated food farther. Since Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took office, food stamp enrollment has increased, which may be relieving some pressure on food programs. But about 80,000 eligible residents are still not enrolled.
New York City is also facing budget cuts, and federal and state financing for hunger-assistance decreased this year by $1.3 million. "There is nothing certain about which government dollars we are currently getting we will get next year," Ms. Mahon said.

HEADLINE: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS; 
He Crunches the Numbers For Clues to a Donor's Heart

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
THOUGH the reasons for giving to charity may differ for every donor, economists have tried to draw some general conclusions about the motives, traits and financial factors that affect people's apparent generosity. The psychological and emotional roots of altruism may be hard to pin down, but that still leaves plenty of room for scientific study. 
 James Andreoni, a professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, has studied charitable giving throughout his career. He recently agreed to discuss what he and his colleagues have uncovered, as well as the questions they hope to answer in the future.

Q. First, let's talk about who gives. In broad terms, what types of people are most likely to make a donation?

A. The main things that predict how much a person gives are how much income they have and whether they can take advantage of the tax deduction for charitable giving. These two are very important.
We also consistently find that people with higher educations give more, and that as people age, they give more, too. But we probably see older and more educated people giving more because they also tend to have more savings and better stock portfolios, not because they really care more about charity.

Q. Do women give more than men? Are there gender differences in giving? Do men give more than women?

A. Most people intuitively think that women are more altruistic, but it's not that simple. Looking at total giving, men tend to give a bit more than women. However, when you factor in that men also tend to have higher incomes, it's hard to say there is a big difference in total dollars given.
Looking more closely, however, we see that men and women respond differently to tax incentives. The tax deduction is a much bigger influence on men's decisions than women's, even though average dollars given are about the same.
We also see this in controlled experiments on giving. Women's altruism tends to be governed more by principles of equality than of cost, and men are the opposite. When altruism is inexpensive to express, men will express more than women. But when being altruistic is costly, women will show more altruism than men.
Another interesting difference between the sexes is that they favor different charities. Women are more likely to give to health, educational or human services charities, whereas men will give more to religious causes. 
Also, men will specialize, giving to one or two things, whereas women spread their money more thinly, giving to more causes.

Q. Let's say we have more than one adult in a household. Who usually makes the decision about giving to whom, how much and when?

A. There has only been one study on this, but it seems that only about half of couples make this decision jointly. In the rest, one spouse or the other will assume primary responsibility.
The interesting thing we found in looking into this question, though, is that deciding as a couple does not necessarily mean it is a harmonious, loving, joint decision. In fact, the tendency in the data seemed to suggest that the husband and the wife are, in effect, policing each other when they decide together, making sure that one spouse doesn't give too much or give to something that the other spouse doesn't like.
Deciding together is more a sign of compromise -- these households gave less than similar households in which one person was in charge. 

Q. It seems like charities often try to get a big gift to kick off their fund-raising drives, on the theory that many smaller gifts will follow. Does this "seeding" idea really work?

A. Economists don't really have much of an opinion on this yet, but from talking to managers of charities, they sure think there is a big seeding effect. They think that one or two really big gifts can be used to get many times the amount in smaller gifts -- that the big gift acts as a guarantee of quality or an endorsement that will encourage others to give, or will create social pressure on others.
This is an important question, because a lot of philanthropists in fact structure their giving as seeding new organizations. They go around helping small organizations get started, but then move on to help start others. 
It also makes sense that the government could play a similar role. If people don't know whether an organization is honest or has a good plan for the future, a government grant might reassure them and cause people to give to this organization. I know some researchers are looking into this now with some new data that has just come online, but we don't have any answers yet.

Q. Early in his administration, President Bush suggested that the country rely more on charities to provide social services. Are there areas where economists might recommend that a private charity take the place of a government-provided service, or vice versa?

A. We have very few studies that look at individual charities, since most of our data comes from people rather than the organizations. A recent study of giving to public radio, however, suggests that the public-private partnership there is very important. If the government dropped its support for National Public Radio and used the money for a tax cut, for example, then this study predicts that the effect on N.P.R. would be severe. People probably wouldn't use the extra money from the tax cut to make up the difference, by increasing donations.

Q. Right now, are charities doing work the government could do?

A. In fact, a lot of charities do the work of government. This is especially true for social service organizations that may have contracts with the government to provide services to a community. This isn't to say they duplicate the government, but they're more an extension of it.
Environmental organizations are sometimes quite different. They may supplement government policy by buying up land and setting it aside, much like the government might do by establishing a national park or wilderness preserve, or by buying pollution permits and not using them, effectively reducing the level of pollution regulated by the government.
Having things done by the government has the advantage that we can save a lot of the expense on private fund-raising. Also, no one can weasel out of paying their fair share. The advantage of having things done privately is that we don't have the expense of collecting more taxes or of lobbying for grants, plus the money goes directly where people prefer it to go.
But with private provision, a lot of people will get away without paying their fair share, so it may be less fair. And there may be less of the charitable activity provided.

Q. And finally, the tough question -- why people give. Can we explain giving just using rational self-interest, as some economists have argued?

A. There is clearly a lot to charitable giving that goes beyond the usual cold and rational economic analysis. There is a lot of emotion and empathy and impulse that goes on, and lots of social pressure from friends or colleagues at work.
The economic data that we collect through surveys or from tax returns really can't get at these other motives very well. Plus, they're really hard to quantify, even for psychologists or sociologists who make it their business to understand such things.
Altruism and giving do respond to social incentives, though. Why, for instance, does the opera print the names of donors in the program? Or why does public television give you a coffee mug for donating? Why do so many people give at the office? These activities are clearly tapping into the social and psychological incentives for giving that are outside the economist's usual model. 
If we are going to understand these markets for charitable giving, and in particular the institution of fund-raising, then we are going to have to think more carefully about the bigger picture.

HEADLINE: OVERSEAS; 
For the Aga Khan, Buildings Are Bridges

BYLINE:  By DANA MICUCCI 

 BODY:
"THE instability that we see around the world, from Afghanistan to Central Europe, is a consequence of the rejection of cultural pluralism," said the Aga Khan, a man who knows a great deal about cultural pluralism.
 He blames that rejection on the enormous gulf of knowledge between the Islamic and the non-Islamic world, a situation that, he said, leaves him deeply saddened. 
 It is late September, and the Aga Khan is speaking to an interviewer in a Boston hotel suite, where he has come to introduce the latest brainchild of one of his favorite causes. Called ArchNet, a collaboration among the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, it is billed as the world's largest online resource for the study of Islamic architecture, urban planning and landscape design.
But right now he is addressing the heightened perceptions of a post-9/11 world. The entire Islamic faith, which he describes as being as "diverse in its beliefs and practices as Christianity," is, he said, often wrongly identified with a single destructive element. 
"No one would look upon" the Irish Republican Army "as representative of Christianity," he said. "The attempt by communal groups, be they ethnic, religious or tribal, to impose themselves on others aims to eradicate the cultural basis of group identity, and without cultural identity social cohesion gradually dissolves."
With tensions at a boiling point in the Middle East, the United States threatening war with Iraq and Muslim charities facing increasing scrutiny as potential underwriters of terrorism, the Aga Khan finds himself straddling a cultural divide in which his various roles as billionaire philanthropist, spiritual leader of 15 million Ismaili Muslims and globe-trotting businessman give him a perspective that is unusual, to say the least.
The hereditary title Aga Khan means great king. It was used as a term of respect in countries like Persia, India and Pakistan, where some of the Aga Khan's ancestors originated. Yet, by all appearances, he is a king without a country. That is both the advantage -- and the difficulty -- of the Aga Khan's role.
The man who now carries the title was born Prince Karim in 1936 in Geneva, the son of Prince Aly Khan and his aristocratic English wife, the former Joan Yarde-Buller. He would probably have remained Prince Karim into adulthood had his grandfather not conferred the title on him at age 20, bypassing his father, who was known as a playboy and was once married to the American actress Rita Hayworth. (A spokesman for the Aga Khan said that the grandfather's will stipulated that a younger imam would be more effective in dealing with a rapidly changing world.)
For this sect of Islam, the roles of globe-trotter and imam are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Ismaili Muslims are a small minority within the faith, scattered among many nations but concentrated mainly in India, Pakistan, Central Asia and parts of North America. Their roots go back a millennium, when there was a split among Shiite Muslims. Most Shiites believe that the line of imams, the Muslim religious leaders descended from the prophet Muhammad, ended in the ninth century. Ismailis believe that the line has continued to the present with the current Aga Khan, whom they consider to be the 49th imam.
Generally progressive and open-minded, Ismailis have made contributions to Islamic thought and culture that are disproportionate to their numbers. For Ismailis, material success is no impediment to spiritual progress, and they see no contradiction in their spiritual leader being renowned for his stable of racehorses. Most Ismailis, like their leader, are cultural pluralists who deplore religious intolerance.
ISMAILIS also have a tradition of philanthropy. The Aga Khan presides over one of the world's richest charitable organizations, the Aga Khan Development Network, which says its assets are approximately $1.87 billion. The network joins all the Aga Khan's charitable ventures, including initiatives for economic and social development, universities in Pakistan and Tajikistan and a cultural trust.
The Aga Khan, a Harvard graduate who as a young man considered becoming an architect, has long been a champion of modern and traditional architecture and of historic preservation. He is the patron of the world's richest architectural prize, a $500,000 award given triennially to groups of architects whose projects contribute to social, economic and cultural development in the Muslim world. His new venture, ArchNet, is part of the Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture, which he founded in 1977 at Harvard and at M.I.T.
To the Aga Khan, cultural and economic development are part of the same continuum. "Philanthropic initiatives cannot be contemplated exclusively in terms of economics," he said, "but rather as an integrated program that encompasses social and cultural dimensions as well." 
As an example, he cites his work in Afghanistan. This year, the Aga Khan Development Network made a $75 million donation to reconstruction and long-term efforts in Afghanistan, including programs for distributing food, resettling refugees, providing social services and restoring historic buildings.
"In Afghanistan, he's using his resources to benefit both the Ismailis and the larger community," said Vartan Gregorian, the president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York, of his friend the Aga Khan. "The Shia Ismaili Muslims are an enlightened, inclusive group who believe in education and progress, self-help and equality between men and women. He's an example of a modern Islamic leader who's building bridges between cultures, dispelling the notion of Islam as a monolithic faith and rightly presenting it as a mosaic of many different voices."
If the Aga Khan seems to be a king without a country, he is in reality a citizen of the world. He lives in Switzerland and in France, but carries a British passport and a French diplomatic passport. Recent global events have left him caught between Islamic and Western viewpoints. The Aga Khan said that his middleman position allows him to cultivate an East-West dialogue. But his situation can isolate him from other Muslims. Because of age-old tensions between Shiite and Sunni Muslims, he is not as active in his philanthropic efforts in Muslim countries that have large populations of Sunni Muslims, like Saudi Arabia. 
The Aga Khan lives in Geneva and near Chantilly, in France, the capital of French racing, where he breeds racehorses. He has three children from his first marriage, to an English society figure, Sally Croker-Poole, and one child from his second marriage, to Princess Gabriele zu Leiningen of Germany. His three older children work for his network, which has offices in Geneva and in Gouvieux, outside Paris. His half-sister, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, the daughter of Prince Aly Khan and Rita Hayworth, is also active in philanthropy, raising money for Alzheimer's disease, the illness from which her mother suffered.
The size of the Aga Khan's personal fortune has been the subject of conjecture, especially in the British press, where he appears frequently. Though estimates cannot be confirmed (even by Forbes Magazine), a spokesman for the Aga Khan would only say that "he is a billionaire."
The basis of the Aga Khan's wealth is contributions from Ismaili Muslims, who are required to donate up to 10 percent of their yearly income to the imam, in addition to his personal inheritance and investment income from that money. 
The network is financed by the Aga Khan's personal resources, additional contributions from Ismaili Muslims and others, and from a range of international and governmental agencies, like the United States Agency for International Development and the European Union. 
"He puts his money where his beliefs are," said James Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank, which has joined with the Aga Khan to finance programs in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
IN some cases, however, money is not enough, no matter how carefully he treads or how unimpeachable the project. Last month, he canceled plans to build an Islamic museum and cultural center in London, on a choice site along the Thames River, opposite the Houses of Parliament. He offered King's College, the owner of the 1.8-acre parcel, an estimated $:24 million (about $39 million) for the land, but was turned down in favor of a neighboring hospital, which wanted to expand but was offering less than half that price. The year before, he was also unsuccessful in his efforts to buy a site owned by the Royal Army Medical College. (On the other hand, in 2001 he established the Institute for the Study of Muslim Civilizations in London, a branch of the Aga Khan University in Pakistan.) 
Instead, the Aga Khan chose Toronto as the site for the Islamic museum and cultural center, which will house his collection of art and historical manuscripts. He cited Toronto's tradition of inclusiveness as one reason for his choice. 
The project is an example of his crusade to "build unity in diversity." Strengthening pluralism in all corners of the globe, he said, "is critical to the development of peace and humankind in the 21st century." But, he added, "We must educate for it."

HEADLINE: CHARITY ON WHEELS; 
Riding Your Heart Out, Then Feeling Betrayed

BYLINE:  By NANCY HARBERT 

 BODY:
I DON'T know which came first: meeting Jeff Belcher, a surgical nurse who had just completed a 500-mile bicycle ride to raise money for AIDS vaccine research, or the lymphoma diagnosis of my oldest brother, John, who had recently discovered he was H.I.V. positive. All I know is that they both influenced me to go where I had never gone before -- on an impossibly long bike ride from Montreal to Portland, Me.
 With Mr. Belcher's encouragement, I signed up for the Canada-U.S. AIDS Vaccine Ride organized by Pallotta TeamWorks, a commercial fund-raising company. For five days in early September 2001, I joined 1,799 other cyclists on a 400-mile-long meandering route. I was nuts, I knew, but I also suspected that, somehow, the experience could change my life if the exertion didn't end it first. 
 By the time I signed up, agreeing to raise a minimum of $3,400 that would be distributed to three research centers working on an AIDS vaccine, my brother had died. The cancer had taken over his body after four months. He was 52. It was January. 
I got out my bike, a 30-year-old 10-speed Puch, fitting for a 47-year-old noncyclist. It had spent more time in storage than on the road, as I have never enjoyed bike riding. I didn't understand what was pleasant about the sport; all it meant was a sore rear end and burning quadriceps.
From the beginning, I did everything I was told: I started out riding 10 to 20 miles at a time along the bike trails of Albuquerque, where I live. Every week, I added more miles. I was always exhausted afterward. After a few months, I began to question my sanity, wondering if my legs would ever be rippling with muscles. Eventually the muscles came, as did my strength and my donations. By the time I flew to Montreal, I had raised nearly $7,200. Never before had I tried such a challenge, both the fund-raising and the physical training, all to honor the memory of my brother. Little did I imagine the disappointment to come.
Despite the rigors of 100-mile days and rolling hills, the ride brought out the best in us. We were told to carry out at least one act of kindness every day, especially when we were least inclined. I cried for my brother every day. Every night, when I rode into camp, the hundreds of riders who had finished the day ahead greeted me with cheers and applause. It was overwhelming. Volunteers hauled our clothes and shelter from town to town and fed us three squares a day. Others made sure we were safe on the road, standing sentry at railroad tracks and busy intersections. Residents occasionally lined the streets, offering encouragement. Most memorable was a man standing lonely on a roadside in Vermont. As I rode past, I heard him say, "Thank you."
At the finish, Dr. Rafi Ahmed, director of the Emory Vaccine Center in Atlanta, stood on a stage and boomed through a sound system that our sweat and tears were helping an Emory scientist, Dr. Harriet Robinson, who was readying a vaccine for clinical trials scheduled to begin this month.
The ride was an opportunity to be part of something far bigger than myself; it offered a sense of the power to make a difference. Not only did I help raise money for a good cause, but my determination to overcome sore knees and a knot in my back for five days brought me closer to the millions who suffer and have died from AIDS.
But last March, when I finally received the tally from my ride, which was lumped into the results of two other AIDS vaccine rides, I was outraged and embarrassed to tell my friends who had given so generously. Of the $18.8 million raised in the three AIDS vaccine races, only $4 million was going to the researchers. How could that be?
A letter from Pallotta TeamWorks to those on the vaccine ride cited the low rider turnout; in fact, only half of those who signed up actually raised money and rode in the events. With $4 million allotted for marketing, advertising and AIDS awareness, $3.75 million for administrative expenses, $1 million in production costs and $6.6 million in participant expenses, there went the profit. The Pallotta people said that if 2,000 more people had participated and raised money, $7.5 million would have been distributed among the researchers. This explanation sounded hollow. I felt ripped off.
I was not alone. In the months after the announcement, one of the three beneficiaries, the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York, ended its relationship with Pallotta. A class-action lawsuit was filed on behalf of the riders, charging that Pallotta led them to believe that a minimum of 60 percent of the rides' proceeds would go to research, rather than the embarrassing 16 percent that actually did. Other Pallotta events were reporting equally low proceeds.
THE company was started by Dan Pallotta, a Los Angeles professional fund-raiser. Some still call him a visionary for the phenomenal amount of money he has raised for AIDS and breast cancer charities, more than $222 million. Earlier this year, his company lost a nasty court battle over the decision of two beneficiaries of a California AIDS ride to cut ties with Pallotta and stage their own race. A result was two California AIDS rides last spring. As the year wore on, criticism mounted against Pallotta and its production and marketing costs, until in early October the company closed.
When I heard the news, I was saddened. I had been hoping Pallotta would finally heed the criticism and make its concept work.
During the last two years, Mr. Pallotta had defended his methods, essentially embracing the concept that a Disneyesque extravagance was necessary to generate the amounts of money he envisioned. Attempts to reach him were answered by Norm Bowling, the company's chief operating officer, who, in a brief e-mail message, blamed "lazy reporters who don't do their homework and write slanted stories" for the damage done to the AIDS vaccine rides. He wrote that the company was no longer responding to news media inquiries.
According to Michael Nilsen, public affairs director of the Association of Fundraising Professionals, special-events fund-raisers like the vaccine rides are the most expensive type of fund-raising. Although the charity (or researchers, in my case) will make money and gain public recognition from the bike riders, the events cost lots of money to stage, which cuts into the proceeds. This year, when the economy is flat, charitable contributions have followed suit, further reducing profits from a special event. The Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Alliance, says the costs of the event should not exceed 35 percent of the amount raised, based on a full year of activity. Pallotta fell well below that mark.
"The big loser is the AIDS vaccine effort," says Dr. Ahmed, who, with Dr. Irvin S. Y. Chen, director of the AIDS Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles, is now looking for other financing.
Despite Pallotta's troubles, both researchers are convinced that the company's intentions were honorable, that Dan Pallotta brought them money, about $1 million a year each to the three researchers in 2001 and 2002, they would not have received any other way. Dr. Ahmed points out that federal funds can take months to obtain and that the proceeds from the vaccine rides have enabled researchers to try riskier ideas that rarely receive federal financing. 
AT U.C.L.A., the proceeds from the AIDS rides provided a third of the institute's annual charitable contributions. Dr. Chen had planned a long-term relationship with Pallotta, and now will miss the exposure.
"Research is long term and not something that's easy to get excited about," Dr. Chen says. "Usually, our fund-raising department holds receptions with 10 to 20 possible donors there. They listen to us politely, but we're not a football team."
As Pallotta struggles with what to do with its semitrailers of stainless-steel showers and portable kitchens, the vision lives on. After the company canceled this year's Canada-United States bike ride, a group of riders staged a grass-roots version. About 125 people pedaled the same route from Montreal to Portland on the same scheduled dates, staying in campgrounds and motels. The riders sent their donations directly to the researchers. This group has vowed that the ride will become an annual event. In Chicago, a couple who made one of the AIDS rides held a cocktail party and raised $10,000 for the U.C.L.A. AIDS Institute.
Perhaps Mr. Pallotta's vision blurred a bit, but he brought awareness to a devastating disease on a scale never achieved before. I am thankful for that. The ride wasn't about me, but it did help me to grieve my brother and change my life because ever since I have tried to be nice to someone every day in some little way. And I discovered that I like bike riding. Last winter, after putting thousands of miles on my Puch, I bought a new one.

Before the Start
HOW can you be sure the donations you raise for a fund-raising event will make their way to the charity and not the organizer's pocket? Bennett Weiner, chief operating officer of the Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Alliance, offers these suggestions:
* Ask the charity how much of the money raised will make it back to the charity.
* Check to see if the charity has run a similar event before and what percentage of the proceeds actually made it back to the charity in the past.
* If this a first-time event, check to see if the organization hired to do the fund-raising has staged similar events for other charities and how successful they have been.
* Go to Web sites of the charities to see how the proceeds were handled in previous events.
* Is there a pledge requirement to participate, and is there a penalty if you drop out?
* What happens if you don't collect all the money you expect to raise through pledges? Do you have to make up the difference?
* How will the money be used within the charity?
* If the event is physically demanding, will you be able to handle it?

HEADLINE: OUT WEST; 
Providing the Little Things That Mean the Most

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif. 

 BODY:
TO talk. To be listened to. To unwind. To be touched.
 When you are a low-income woman with cancer, and you live in the margins, it is often the little things -- a caring touch, a steaming cup of herbal tea -- that can make a difference. 
 "Sometimes I just want to talk," Carol Neal, a 59-year-old waitress who has malignant melanoma, said about her visits twice a month to the Charlotte Maxwell Clinic here. "Sometimes I just want to be touched. That's human." 
Decorated with patchwork quilts and Tibetan Buddhist prayer flags, the clinic addresses what a social worker at the clinic, Beverly Lowe, calls an invisible problem -- the economic and emotional fallout that cancer can have on low-income women already underserved by the health care system. 
The clinic -- a volunteer network of some 120 massage therapists, acupuncturists, social workers and homeopathy specialists in the Bay Area -- provides free alternative medicine treatments and other services to women for whom even a massage is an unthinkable, unaffordable luxury. 
"It keeps the pain away," said Michelle Smots, 39, who comes in every weekend for acupuncture to relieve the side effects of chemotherapy. "This place keeps me going from head to toe." 
Founded in 1989 with $4,000, the clinic, considered a model for other organizations, is named after Charlotte Maxwell, a social worker who died of ovarian cancer and who thought that alternative therapies enhanced her life in her final months. 
In the last decade, the clinic has grown from a tiny office serving a small number of women one afternoon a week to the first floor of a clapboard house visited by more than 250 clients, including more and more homeless women. It is dedicated to countering some bleak statistics: according to the American Cancer Society, low-income patients with breast cancer have lower five-year survival rates than higher-income patients. 
In California, the mortality rate for African-American women is 23.4 percent higher than for white women, even though the incidence rate is 18.8 percent lower, according to the state cancer registry. Low-income black women are also three times more likely than higher-income black women to receive a diagnosis in the advanced stages of disease. While a cancer diagnosis can be devastating, to a woman who may be a single mother, or working in a low-paying job with no benefits, it can tip the balance into poverty.
"Many clients come in in acute stages of crisis," said Beverly Burns, an acupuncturist who specializes in women with cancer and is a co-founder of the clinic. "If you clean houses for a living and you can't work that week because of chemotherapy, it can take a huge financial and emotional toll." 
The clinic, which receives financing from the California Endowment, the local Susan G. Komen Foundation, the East Bay Community Foundation and other nonprofit groups, has an annual budget of about $250,000 and provides support in many ways. Acupuncture has been used to treat post-surgical pain, and chemotherapy-related nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Chinese herbs have been used to help ease symptoms of premature menopause and the side effects of tamoxifen, a breast cancer medicine. The clinic handles large issues, like an emergency fund to help pay a rent, and small ones, like providing pillows to ease the pain of bone metastasis, or creams to soothe parched, burning skin after radiation therapy. If a woman has no transportation, a network of volunteers serves as drivers; if she is too sick to travel, therapists make house calls. 
From grocery bags of organic produce to the mailbox on the front porch for herb pickups, the idea is to rebalance the body both physically and psychically. "Coming here gives me energy and helps my body deal with all the stress," said Patricia Ramirez, a 30-year-old waitress who started radiation treatments for breast cancer a year ago. "It's having my own time for relaxing."
The clinic is a supplement to, not a replacement for, conventional cancer therapy. All clients are required to see oncologists. They typically find out about the Charlotte Maxwell Clinic from oncologists, hospital social workers and cancer support groups. Although some clients receive disability payments, many do not because of requirements that the patient be disabled for at least a year. "Frequently, treatment doesn't last that long, at least initially," said Ms. Lowe, the social worker. Medicare payments do not cover loss of income. 
For a woman without insurance in a marginal job, anxiety about the disease is often compounded by harsh reality. "When women without financial resources get cancer, the level of fear about potentially becoming homeless or being unable to care for one's children is hard to articulate," Ms. Lowe said. "There's also often a loss of self-esteem. They somehow feel they've done something wrong because they got sick and don't have health insurance."
Massage and other alternative therapies, services not covered by insurance and typically available only to people with financial resources, are an attempt to redress an imbalance in the health care system.
"Ethnic minority women have a great disparity in terms of cancer survival rates," said Tari Hanneman, senior program associate with the California Endowment, a nonprofit group focusing on health care. "The services that the clinic provides help this population get through and adhere to their cancer treatments so it can improve their outcomes." The endowment recently gave the clinic a $25,000 grant through its Local Opportunities Fund, which is intended to support grass-roots and nontraditional organizations.
In addition to acupuncture and massage, the clinic provides a dose of optimism. "In this society illness is so isolating," said Laura V. Moreno, 43, a cancer survivor who grew up in Mexico and is a translator and activities director for the clinic, leading kayaking trips. "People come in here and for a few hours they have full attention."
Linda Burdusis, 54, who has breast cancer, often has difficulty sleeping because of the pain that has metastasized into her bones. Her visits and the acupuncture treatments help her sleep through the night for a day or two. "It helps with my overall mood," she said. "You're feeling loved throughout the whole procedure. These volunteers could be in their clinics earning money, but instead they're here." 
The clinic is open two and a half days a week. A satellite clinic has just started at the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine in San Francisco, offering the same services one weekend a month. At the Oakland clinic, the demand is such that it can take two weeks to a month for a slot to become available, and the frequency of visits is based on need. The long-range goal, Ms. Burns said, is to expand and serve more women by keeping the clinic open five days a week. She said the clinic would need $700,000 a year to stay open that much, and would include hiring additional support staff.
The atmosphere, which always includes coffee, doughnuts and lively conversation, contrasts not only with her hospital, Ms. Burdusis said, but also with her support group. "In the support group, everyone's complaining," she said. "You can get very depressed. I'm a hugger, and the human touch feels so good. You walk out of here with a calmed spirit."

HEADLINE: THE ARTS; 
How AT&T Picks Plays: Tracking 'Bright Ideas'

BYLINE:  By KELLY CROW 

 BODY:
ONE afternoon in early April, Timothy J. McClimon, director of the AT&T Cultural Foundation, gave out invitations -- over the telephone, naturally -- to 68 of the country's better-known theater companies. Each was asked to submit a new play or musical in an annual contest AT&T calls OnStage. Seven winners would each receive a grant up to $85,000 to help put them into production.
 Minutes after Mr. McClimon called the Cleveland Play House, the staff members there giddily whispered the news to one another. But Seth Gordon, the director of new play development, sat at his desk, figuring the odds. He wanted to win, but he could not help feeling intimidated by the competition. 
 Mr. Gordon knew that AT&T was a flagship giver to charitable causes, awarding more than $50 million in grants, with $9 million going to the arts last year despite the sluggish economy. Growing up in New York, he had seen AT&T's name in newspaper advertisements for many of his favorite Broadway shows. And of course he was familiar with the OnStage contest, which favors works by women and minorities and has provided seed money for many Tony and Pulitzer Award winners, most recently Suzan-Lori Parks's "Topdog/Underdog." 
The Cleveland Play House had itself won an OnStage grant for Wendy Kesselman's "Butcher's Daughter" in 1988, but had since been invited only once, and came up empty. So, it was with some anxiety that Mr. Gordon sent this year's entry, a dark comedy called "Bright Ideas," which had been written for Cleveland by Eric Coble, 34, a local playwright who has written dozens of plays. Then Mr. Gordon waited for the awards to be announced, in late September.
"So many are invited and so few win, and the math works against you," he said. "For months, we sat with guarded enthusiasm, knowing we had been invited before and lost. This contest is just so competitive."
The process of awarding arts grants has long been something of a mystery, especially to those who, like Mr. Gordon, are on tenterhooks while it all plays out. The National Endowment for the Arts has been criticized for how it structures and distributes its estimated $97 million in annual grants. (Often, its grant winners are selected before money is ever found to give them.) And the details on how corporations like AT&T, Philip Morris and American Express make their grants to the arts have been equally elusive. 
What is not in question is the importance of the largess these groups deliver. Last year, America's 2,018 corporate foundations gave out $3.1 billion, with $465 million going to the arts, according to estimates by the Foundation Center, an organization that tracks institutional philanthropy. Despite the economic downturn, the center reported that corporate giving eked out an increase of 2.6 percent from the previous year.
With so much money at stake, numerous cultural foundations have streamlined their grant-making operation. There is, of course, the element of subjectivity and risk. "Producing new plays is scary, especially in this climate," Mr. McClimon said. "No one knows until the end whether they'll flop or win a Pulitzer."
But there was the feeling the process could be more efficient and businesslike -- and more straightforward as far as the arts groups are concerned. 
"We're not talking about a program shift, but a process shift," said Jennifer P. Goodale, director of corporate contributions at Philip Morris. "With more people wanting money and fewer people giving and managing it, we realized that perhaps the business way was the best way."
For the OnStage program, that meant no more unsolicited grant proposals. Instead, the staff at AT&T culled a list of 68 theaters from the database of a consultant, the Theatre Communications Group, which supports professional nonprofit theater and has 425 member theaters. Past winners and theaters known for producing new works were favored, as were those recommended by the foundation's 13 grant councils nationwide. The councils are made up of AT&T employees and theater professionals who scout talent and distribute small grants to arts groups.
BY the end of May, 45 proposals had been submitted. The AT&T Foundation's trustees -- 11 senior executives who meet monthly -- selected what they considered the best 23 plays and musicals for screening by an outside panel. That panel, picked by the Theatre Communications Group, consisted of Janet Allen, artistic director of the Indiana Repertory Theatre; the playwrights Tom Jones and Diana Son; the composer Mel Marvin; and the director Susana Tubert.
When Mr. Marvin, who won an OnStage grant for his 1988 musical "Elmer Gantry," opened his box of applications in mid-June, he knew that the competitors were elite: he recognized nearly every name. 
They included Richard Nelson, the playwright who brought "James Joyce's 'The Dead' " to the stage; Eduardo Machado, who wrote "Havana Is Waiting"; and Craig Lucas, who wrote "Prelude to a Kiss." Such high-profile names were not as common when Mr. Marvin had served on panels for the National Endowment for the Arts, which is mandated by Congress to allow any nonprofit organization to apply for its grants. 
"It was an amazing thing to open this big box and see a whole raft of plays by most of America's best playwrights," he said of the OnStage entries. "I saw so many chances sitting there."
The panel was to meet July 26, through a seven-way conference call, which included Mr. McClimon and a moderator from the Theater Communications Group, Emilya Cachapero. Mr. Marvin had made many trips to Washington to sit through two-day sessions of federal grant panels. This time, he looked forward to staying in Manhattan and simply dialing into the discussion.
But Ms. Allen, the panel member from Indiana, did not. She had been on grant panels for the Pew Charitable Trusts and found that watching panelists during debates helped in making her own decisions, she said.
"So much happens when you're in a room with other people," she said. "You read body language and facial expressions. The phone panel is an interesting animal, more efficient but without bringing much depth to the process."
At the appointed time, however, she called the panel from a friend's home office in Dutchess County, N.Y., where she was on holiday. She was curious about how the panel would whittle 14 finalists from 23. Her theater had never been invited to try.
After an hour of discussion and a single round of voting, nearly half of the applicants were eliminated. A children's play was rejected because Ms. Allen did not deem it well written. The others agreed. Ms. Tubert, the director, spoke highly of a play by Lynn Nottage, "Intimate Apparel." The two women had worked together once, but Ms. Tubert stressed that her vote was strictly based on merit. 
Ms. Tubert said later that during the discussion about Mr. Machado's entry, she chose to keep quiet until near the end because she did not want to sway the panel's opinion. "I'm not here because I'm Latina," she told the panel. "Hopefully, I'm here because I'm a director and I know a lot about the theater world." 
When the group deadlocked on several entries concerned with parenting issues, among them Cleveland's entry, the panel looked to statements submitted by the theaters about their commitments to their playwrights. Cleveland had nurtured Eric Coble's writing for five years, meeting with him every two weeks to review new pages. Mr. Coble's satire follows a suburban couple who scheme and kill, a la "Macbeth," to get their child into the best preschool. 
"I feel like there's an honesty behind this theater in really encouraging this guy," Ms. Tubert said. The others agreed.
So it went for nearly three hours, until 14 finalists were chosen. Ms. Tubert hung up with no regrets. Ms. Allen had one. "I keep thinking about a play that I rated high but didn't make it," she said. "It was about a minority experience, and the panel said the play felt too commercial. They all hated it, but I don't know. I just liked it. Deep down, I bet we all had one that got away."
IN late July, Mr. McClimon made another round of calls to notify 14 theaters to say they were finalists. But before a final judgment could be made, Mr. McClimon had to see to a few marketing details. He wanted to make sure that the selected OnStage productions were spread across the country and the calendar. One finalist is scheduled for Baltimore in February and Costa Mesa, Calif., in April. Good. Another is planned for Seattle in June. Great. Three of the remaining finalists are in New York, but the city has always been top-heavy with winners. No problem.
AT&T had allocated $450,000 for the grants, which Mr. McClimon called an average amount in helping to finance six to eight productions. Some years, the amount is as high as $500,000, he said. On Aug. 23, Seth Gordon was sitting at his desk when the call came from New York. "Bright Ideas" made it. Mr. Gordon said thank you several times, perhaps too loudly, he recalled, and hung up.
"I went down the hall, telling everyone we had won, and then I sent out this huge e-mail with the news," he said. He also called an ecstatic Mr. Coble. "Of course," Mr. Gordon said, "the only thing most people wanted to know was how much we had won, and in my excitement, I had forgotten to ask."
He called back. The theater was getting $70,000, with $5,000 going to the playwright. The official announcement came with a news conference on Sept. 25.
(The other winners were ACT Theatre, Seattle, "The Singing Forest," by Mr. Lucas; Center Stage, Baltimore, and South Coast Repertory, Costa Mesa, Calif., co-production of Ms. Nottage's "Intimate Apparel"; Intar Hispanic America Arts Center, New York, "The Cook," by Mr. Machado; Playwrights Horizons, New York, "My Life With Albertine," by Mr. Nelson and Ricky Ian Gordon; and the Public Theater/New York Shakespeare Festival, "The Story," by Tracey Scott Wilson.) 
"Bright Ideas" opened on Oct. 15 to a full house and mixed reviews (some critics called it clever; others overly long). But for weeks before its scheduled closing on Nov. 10, Mr. Gordon often caught himself scanning ads in the biggest newspapers and magazines. What he looked for -- and often found -- was his theater on a splashy color ad. And somewhere, often near the bottom, was a logo for AT&T, corporate sponsor.
"We've never had a play advertised in Newsweek before," he said. "That was a thrill."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
With few words, a Hewlett-Packard campaign draws on the theme of technology in action.

BYLINE:  By Steve Lohr 

 BODY:
WHEN Carleton S. Fiorina was unexpectedly chosen to become chief executive of Hewlett-Packard in 1999, many people in the computer industry questioned whether she was up to the job. But no one really doubted her skills as a marketer. She had made her reputation at Lucent Technologies as the executive who repositioned and rebranded the telecommunications equipment maker prior to its spinoff from AT&T in 1996.
 Ms. Fiorina brought her confident marketing touch to Hewlett-Packard and quickly put a new focus on the company's marketing and branding program. A fragmented system, with product divisions and sales regions doing their own marketing, was streamlined and centralized. Its advertising carried a unifying logo, "hp invent" -- an attempt to link the Silicon Valley company's innovative past with its present. 
 Not everyone loved it: company traditionalists cringed at the emphasis on the hp initials instead of the spelled out Hewlett-Packard name as an act akin to sacrilege, belittling to the company's revered founders, William Hewlett and David Packard.
The next big step in the company's image makeover begins today with a new advertising campaign that Hewlett-Packard executives describe as a "significant multiyear brand investment" that will add up to "several hundred million dollars" over the next few years. The campaign is the first corporate marketing initiative since Hewlett-Packard acquired Compaq Computer in May -- the largest merger in the history of the computer business, and one fiercely resisted in a proxy fight led by the heirs of the company's founders.
The worldwide marketing program will include print and television ads, and ads online and on billboards. The print ads include 16-page inserts today in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, as well in this week's issues of Time, Business Week, Newsweek and The Economist. All the ads feature Hewlett-Packard technology being used by customers -- from NASA space missions to computer animation in Hollywood to bird watching in Finland. They all show variations of the formula "+ hp = everything is possible." So the NASA ad is a close-up photograph of an astronaut's helmet, and its reflected images, accompanied by the text, "explorers + hp = everything is possible."
"This is the first expression of the merged company," said Allison Johnson, Hewlett-Packard's senior vice president for branding and advertising. "And the equation is really an important tool for how we think about what we do. It sets the tone for who this company is and what it stands for."
To most people, Hewlett-Packard is still known mainly as the company that makes the H-P computer printers in so many offices and homes. With Compaq, the company is also increasingly thought of as a personal computer maker as well, according to the company's market research.
Yet the strategy behind the merger was to create a major technology company with the depth, breadth and prowess to tackle all manner of computing challenges. And that is what the corporate ads highlight: the computer systems that run Amazon.com, for example, and the software that manages the data centers of Federal Express.
In that sense, Hewlett-Packard is trying to position itself, it seems, in a territory familiar to another computer company, I.B.M. Big Blue, industry analysts agree, has deftly marketed itself as a company that can handle any technology challenge for corporate customers and is a research leader. "H-P has to find a way to at least meet I.B.M. on that ground," said Merv Adrian, an analyst at the Giga Information Group, a technology research firm.
Hewlett-Packard's effort to stir some interest and excitement in the slumping technology sector is very different from the large advertising campaign begun two weeks ago by I.B.M.
The I.B.M. ads promote on-demand computing, in which technology is supplied to companies as a utility-style service. The ads to explain the concept are dense with text and poke fun at fantasy gadgets like a "universal business adapter," which vainly try to be silver-bullet solutions to the complexity of computing.
The Hewlett-Packard ads, in contrast, are arresting color pictures of technology in action with few words. They are the work of Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, part of the Omnicom Group and one of Hewlett-Packard's two remaining principal agencies, down from more than 60 worldwide when Ms. Fiorina took over. (The other is the Publicis Groupe.) Other clients of Goodby Silverstein, the largest ad agency in San Francisco, include SBC, Saturn, Goodyear, Budweiser and eBay.
"It's a very practical-minded campaign," said Steve Simpson, the creative director responsible for the ads. "These are not technology promises, these are accomplished facts."
Rich Silverstein, co-founder of Goodby Silverstein, suggested another message: "The merger is already working."
The Hewlett-Packard ads, Mr. Silverstein said, are more upbeat and positive than the I.B.M. approach. The Hewlett ads, he noted, show technology working whereas in his view the I.B.M. ads tended to emphasize a "gallows humor" when technology failed. "I.B.M. is telling customers that technology is too hard, too complex, and you need us to take it off your hands for you," Mr. Silverstein said. "Our message is we'll work with you as a partner to make the technology work."
Still, the comparison with I.B.M. flatters Hewlett-Packard. I.B.M. is already one of the most powerful brands in the world, ranked No. 3 behind only Coca-Cola and Microsoft, according to Interbrand, a market research firm. Hewlett-Packard is not in the same brand league.
Nor is Hewlett-Packard in the same league in terms of spending. In the United States, I.B.M. spent $994 million on advertising last year, while Hewlett-Packard and Compaq spent a combined $288 million. Hewlett-Packard executives say its overall advertising and marketing spending will rise, but not a lot.
"The new I.B.M. ads are to promote a new service offering, whereas the H-P message is much more, 'You don't know what we've got, and let us show it to you,' " said Amy Wohl, a computer industry consultant in Narberth, Pa. "So the ad campaigns are very different."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Businesses, Big and Small, Bet on Wireless Internet Access

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 17 

 BODY:
From a rooftop overlooking hundreds of failed dot-com businesses in the South of Market district here, an inelegant picture-frame sized antenna is now radiating the Internet over a 20-block area.
 There are some here who think that the antenna, a wireless Internet-access transmitter and receiver, represents the next big thing. 
 In the wake of the wild financial boom and bust that followed the emergence of the World Wide Web eight years ago, it pays to be wary. Yet there are those who argue that the wireless Internet is the logical next example of the new industries that have successively spun out of Silicon Valley, from PC's to hand-held computers.
The next industry cycle may revolve around a wireless data technology known as Wi-Fi, which has the potential to eventually let anyone with a computer or computing device connect to the Internet at high speeds, without cables. For evidence of the trend look no further than airport waiting lounges, Starbucks coffee shops, maybe even your next-door neighbor's den, or any of the other locales for the Wi-Fi hubs now used by an estimated 15 million wireless Net surfers in this country. 
The Federal Communications Commission is taking a growing interest in the technology, and major companies including I.B.M., Intel and AT&T are hatching Wi-Fi plans.
Like the Web, which flourished into an entirely new medium created atop the freely accessible communications standards of the Internet, Wi-Fi has a similar starting point. It has been made possible because the federal government decided a few years ago to set aside a small swath of unlicensed radio frequencies and allow everyone who followed a simple set of rules to share them among themselves.
Just as the Web opened the Internet to innovative information providers and hundreds of millions of users by making the network easier to use, Wi-Fi, proponents predict, will make possible many innovations by making the Internet easier to connect to -- at speeds comparable to today's fastest digital phone lines or cable modem hook-ups. The next big wave in applications is likely to be "location aware" communications -- whether conveniences like directions to the nearest restaurant or movie theater, or intrusions like neighborhood spam that will assault Web surfers as they sit in coffee shops or stoll down the street.
In an otherwise bleak Silicon Valley, Wi-Fi and its anytime, anywhere Internet capabilities now stand out as the one area in which there is now a fresh burst of entrepreneurial and technical creativity. 
"This feels like the opening of the PC era when for the first time you could own your own computer," said Ken Biba, the chief executive of Vivato, the company with the odd-looking antenna. "With Wi-Fi you can own your own communications. That's a profound social change." 
An F.C.C. task force released a report last week that calls for rethinking the traditional approach by which regulators allocate the public airwaves. The report recommended a more flexible consumer-oriented policy that will highlight new technology-based systems to make more efficient use of the radio spectrum and make it easier to create new digital wireless services.
If the proposals become policy, there could be an even fuller flowering of the wireless Internet. Here in San Francisco, for example, Vivato is but one of dozens of start-ups pursuing Wi-Fi opportunities.
Vivato's antenna is meant to expand Wi-Fi's current range and capacity -- service to several dozen people all within a few hundred feet of the transmitter -- by making a single antenna accessible to a thousand or more people at distances of up to four miles.
Vivato's antenna is able to create directional beams rather than radiating energy in all directions, as most other Wi-Fi systems now do. This makes it possible to greatly extend the range of the system at low power and reach more users.
As many as two dozen other companies have appeared with alternative approaches to Vivato's, many of them involving so-called mesh networks that use multiple antennas to pass data around like a bucket brigade. Beyond the antenna makers are companies like Boingo Wireless and Surf and Sip that are attempting to assemble networks of individual Wi-Fi "hot spots" around a region or around the country, permitting computer users to pay a single subscription or access fee and then use the networks from a variety of sites as they move about.
So far, Apple Computer has been one of the few name-brand companies promoting Wi-Fi -- in Apple's case with a product called AirPort. But now some of the nation's most powerful technology companies are in the hunt. Intel, I.B.M. and AT&T are jointly exploring an ambitious effort code-named Project Rainbow, which would create a Wi-Fi-based network of networks in metropolitan areas across the nation. If they proceed -- a public announcement may come soon -- such a system would conceivably put high-speed Internet access within easy reach of Web surfers in most urban areas. 
Intel's motivation lies in its Banias line of chips for mobile computing, which it plans to introduce with a major marketing campaign in January. The Banias chips will come standard with a built-in Wi-Fi function and are to be installed in more than 20 million laptop computers shipped next year. Intel forecasts that some 60 million computers worldwide will contain Banias chips and their Wi-Fi feature by the end of 2004. 
Intel is promising a marketing campaign that will exceed the scope of its effort to promote its Pentium 4 microprocessor, and the company predicts that Wi-Fi will ultimately break the bottleneck that has limited the rollout of broadband, or high-speed, Internet access to more than a fraction of United States households.
"There is no question in my mind that wireless 'bitways' will make the traditional communications business obsolete," said Leslie L. Vadasz, an executive vice president of Intel and president of its Intel Capital investment unit. 
Expressing a similar view, the F.C.C. chairman, Michael K. Powell, said in a speech in Colorado last month: "Spectrum-based paths to homes and businesses hold great promise for the delivery of high-speed Internet. These paths ride on a variety of platforms: fixed and mobile, terrestrial and satellite, licensed and unlicensed." 
Some economists argue that by opening more of the broadcast spectrum to more efficient use by new digital radio technologies, the F.C.C. will further accelerate the rate of innovation that is already taking place. "When you have free spectrum you have zero cost for that input and no restrictions on who can use the spectrum," said Gregory L. Rosston, the deputy director of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. "It serves as a powerful incentive because there are people who have different visions who create different devices."
He cautions, though, that Wi-Fi may not be a perfect solution. "At the same time, it may create congestion in the airwaves, so there is a real trade-off," he said.
Moreover, many Silicon Valley entrepreneurs in the digital wireless world warn that powerful interests in the wired Internet business are unlikely to meekly accept such a challenge to the status quo. 
Traditional owners of the airwaves -- from radio and television station owners to companies like Motorola that provide special-purpose communications systems -- may bitterly resist giving up some of their existing spectrum or being subjected to potential interference from competing users. Veterans of the policy battles agree. 
"In their candid moments everybody at the F.C.C. will tell you they are being pressured quite severely by various forces that are quite concerned about Wi-Fi," said Reed E. Hundt, a former chairman of the F.C.C. "They're worried that it is really a trenching machine that will uproot the entrenched forces."

HEADLINE: New Ways of Saving 

BYLINE:  By Gene Sperling; Gene Sperling, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, was national economic adviser to President Bill Clinton from 1997 to 2001.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Let's face it: Neither Democrats nor Republicans have a viable plan for how they are going to reform Social Security so it can remain solvent for the next generation of retirees. What's more, while the parties haggle over initiatives that are bound to fail, Social Security is becoming ever more vulnerable. Because a permanent solution is not on the horizon, we would do well to consider an interim one. 
 Here's a thought. Instead of repealing the estate tax entirely, Congress and President Bush should dramatically expand the tax's exemption. By increasing the exemption from $2 million to $5 million per couple, more than 99 percent of estates would not pay a penny in taxes. At the same time, by keeping a portion of the tax in effect, the government would save more than $600 billion over 20 years, an amount sufficient to finance a plan for progressive savings accounts outside of Social Security. 
 How would the plan work? The idea would be to provide Americans a matching contribution for up to $1,000 a year in savings deducted from their paychecks. For middle-income families, it could be a one-to-one match; for low-income families, it could be a two-to-one match -- or they could even receive seed money to start their savings. A family eligible for a two-to-one match could accumulate a nest egg of $250,000 in today's dollars simply by contributing $700 a year for 40 years, assuming a 5 percent rate of return.
The accounts could be set up by private entities or through the thrift savings plan now used by federal workers. And they could offer investors choice -- but only among broadbased, diversified funds.
Why would an interim solution of progressive accounts succeed when so much else has failed?
First, universal progressive savings accounts make economic sense because they would increase national savings, putting the country in a more fiscally sound position to reach an eventual agreement on Social Security reform. Our current system of encouraging savings with tax deductibility is backward: it gives the biggest incentives to the most well off and the smallest incentives to those with low and moderate incomes. 
For example, nearly 90 percent of part-time workers and small-business employees, and more than 60 percent of Hispanics, have no employer-based pensions. Many women who leave the work force to care for children feel they have fewer incentives to save once they've lost the benefits their company provided. A universal pension or savings plan would help tens of millions of people by essentially offering them a generous 401(k). 
Second, such a plan makes political sense because it offers both sides of the privatization debate a victory that could justify an interim truce. 
Democrats could claim credit for an individual savings strategy that did nothing to undermine Social Security's guaranteed, risk-free benefit structure -- not to mention one that would promote responsibility by encouraging people to prepare for retirement.
Republicans, on the other hand, could claim that, while they temporarily put aside the battle on private Social Security accounts, they won by convincing the country to support a new experiment with individual accounts that emphasizes private savings and individual choice.
Both sides could avoid claims that they were increasing taxes, as this initiative would simply turn a tax cut for the wealthiest families into a refundable tax credit for tens of millions of families.
For an interim solution, that's not half bad.

HEADLINE: F.B.I. Raids Headquarters of Health Services Lender 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL ONEAL 

 BODY:
F.B.I. agents raided the headquarters of National Century Financial Enterprises Inc. in Dublin, Ohio, on Saturday, seizing the books and computer records of the troubled health care finance company. 
 The raid came as the company has been struggling with financial problems that began in late October and that may force it to file for bankruptcy as early as today. 
 Documents from court actions against the company have accused National Century of gross mismanagement and of hiding information. What is becoming clear is that for clients and investors, millions of health care receivables supposedly backing $3.35 billion in bonds, once AAA rated, may have never existed. 
The former chairman and chief executive of National Century, Lance K. Poulsen, resigned both posts under pressure on Nov. 8 and could not be reached for comment. 
Lawyers for the company's board, which is led by two bankers from J. P. Morgan Chase, said National Century and Alvarez & Marsal, a turnaround firm the board has hired, would cooperate with the F.B.I.
One of the lawyers, Paul E. Harner, said F.B.I. agents seized a number of records and computers on Saturday from National Century.
National Century is one of the largest health care finance companies in the country. It lends money to cash-short health care companies in return for taking over rights to their receivables -- payments expected from insurers and government programs like Medicare and Medicaid. It then packages those receivables into bonds and sells them to investors, who receive interest derived from the insurance payments. National Century gets a part of each transaction. 
But last spring, new investors started to shy away from National Century bonds, depriving it of new capital. In response, the company took money from reserve accounts backing two bond trusts worth $3.35 billion. When investors discovered that almost $350 million was missing from a trust called NPF XII, they protested and National Century's finances began to fall apart. 
Facing a liquidity crisis, National Century stopped making payments to hundreds of hospital and home health care clients. That, in turn, led two large clients -- PhyAmerica Physician Group in Durham, N.C., and Tender Loving Care, a unit of Med Diversified in Andover, Mass. -- to seek bankruptcy protection. 
Now, National Century's clients and its bondholders, including Pacific Investment Management Company or Pimco, are battling for control of the remaining receivables. 
But millions of those receivables may not exist. Instead, the company appears to have been using its bonds to prop up troubled companies like Med Diversified in which National Century or its officers -- including Mr. Poulsen and his wife, Barbara, -- either have an ownership interest or own outright. The bonds were underwritten by Credit Suisse First Boston and rated AAA until Oct. 25 by Moody's Investors Service.
One window to the company's operations is an affidavit filed on Friday in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas in Columbus, Ohio. In the filing, Kenneth J. Phelan, a managing director of Bank One, which served as trustee for the NPF XII transaction, described a discussion with Sherry Gibson, an executive vice president at National Century. According to the affidavit, Ms. Gibson said that National Century lent more money to clients than it could support with patient receivables. 
Rather, the company accepted real estate and even artwork as collateral, which violated the bond indenture. NPF XII is supposed to have about $2 billion in collateral. Of that, according to the affidavit, Ms. Gibson told Mr. Phelan that $800 million was in "nonpatient specific receivables." In other words, 40 percent of the bonds are backed by collateral that has nothing to do with insurance payments. 
According to the affidavit, Ms. Gibson also said that National Century failed to write off receivables that were more than 180 days past due, as required by the bond indentures. She explained that executives often reclassified the bonds as collateral in a category called "150+ day." Likewise, Ms. Gibson said executives advanced monies to companies that provided receivables for services that had yet to be performed. If the service was never performed, this was not reflected in the books. And National Century kept lending the client money anyway, according to the affidavit.
As for the reserve funds securing the bond transactions, Ms. Gibson told Mr. Phelan that executives routinely moved money in and out of the accounts. They staggered the reporting days of the reserves so that they could make sure one was full on a given day, even if the other was not. As trustee, Bank One was supposed to monitor the activity, as was J. P. Morgan, which acted as trustee for a sister transaction called NPF VI. 
Both banks have been sued by Med Diversified, which has accused trustees of not monitoring the bonds. But according to the affidavit, Ms. Gibson said that National Century had provided false information to Bank One "to get it past the trustees or the trustees would not move the cash."
Mr. Harner, the company's lawyer, said, "We expect that all of these types of allegations will be fully investigated by independent parties." 
Until now, the extent of National Century's ownership in its clients was not known. But other papers in the bondholder suit outline that the company and its affiliates have major stakes in 10 of its biggest customers. As much as 56 percent of the receivables come from affiliated companies, giving National Century an economic interest in both sides of a bond transaction -- a clear conflict of interest.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: EDUCATION; 
No Decline Found in Number of Students Going Overseas or Coming to U.S.

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Despite concerns that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks might frighten college students away from studying abroad, several new surveys suggest that both the number of students going overseas and the number coming into the United States have held steady or risen this year.
 Two foreign study organizations found that the number of American students going abroad is still growing. Of more than 300 colleges and universities that responded to an online survey by the New York-based Institute of International Education in October, 45 percent said they were sending more students abroad this year, 34 percent said the number was about the same as last year, and 18 percent said they had sent fewer students. 
 In Chicago, the Institute for the International Education of Students, which runs study-abroad programs in Europe, Asia, Latin America and Australia, said the number of participants grew during the summer and this fall, after a 6 percent decline last spring. 
This fall, 902 students are in the institute's one-semester programs, up 14 percent from a year earlier. Another 768 students are in its full-year programs, a 2 percent gain over last year. 
Mary Dwyer, the institute's president, said applications to study abroad next spring were running 23 percent ahead of last spring, although she said she did not know how many students would actually enroll.
"Students feel they need to be more sophisticated and aware of what's going on in the world," Dr. Dwyer said. "With the sluggish economy and world events, it's their parents who are the question mark." 
Three organizations that examined the number of foreign college students studying in the United States this year found that this number, too, appears to have held steady or increased, despite longer waiting periods for visas.
Many colleges reported that a growing number of their students -- especially men from Arab nations, India and China -- could not obtain visas. These included students who had already completed one or more years at an American college but were not allowed to re-enter the United States after returning home. The colleges said they expected some of these students to receive visas for the spring semester.
The 50 public universities that responded to a survey by the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges said they had 25,302 undergraduates from other countries this semester, an average increase of 1.4 percent over last year. The number of graduate students from other countries jumped 7.1 percent, to 49,453. 
A joint survey by the Association of American Universities and Nafsa: Association of International Educators, a trade group of about 8,500 college officials involved in international education, found that the number of foreign students on their campuses was about the same as last year. Seventy-seven campuses responded to the survey.
Officials of all the organizations cautioned that their samples were limited and that some campuses provided estimates because they did not have final tallies yet.
Still, Allan E. Goodman, president of the Institute of International Education, which administers the Fulbright program and other academic exchanges, said he was convinced that student exchanges in both directions would continue to grow.
"The fundamentals haven't changed," Mr. Goodman said. "Most countries have a shortage of universities. The global perception is still that American higher education is the world's best.
"And for students here, there is a new reality: that Americans ought to discover the world. Virtually every college president and dean is saying that an international experience ought to be part of a college education."
The institute's newly released annual survey, "Open Doors: Report on International Educational Exchange," showed that a record 582,996 foreign students attended American colleges and universities in the 2001-02 academic year, a 6.4 percent increase over the previous year. 
Most of those students arrived in the United States before the Sept. 11 attacks. Colleges said last year that relatively few of their foreign students left after the attacks.
The number of American students studying abroad for college credit also continued to climb, according to the "Open Doors" report. In the 2000-01 academic year, a record 154,168 American college students studied abroad, a 7.4 percent increase from the previous year and more than double the number in 1991-92. 
The campuses sending the most students abroad were Michigan State University (1,835), the University of Texas (1,633) and New York University (1,471). Fifteen smaller colleges, including Antioch, Carleton, DePauw and Kalamazoo, sent more than 80 percent of their students to study in another country.
Europe is still the most popular destination for American students, but a growing number are choosing less traditional countries like New Zealand, Cuba, South Africa and Vietnam. The number heading to the Middle East dropped by 60 percent, to 1,659.
The report, which is supported by the State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, also said that for the first time, India sent the most students to the United States in 2001-02, passing China, the previous leader. India sent 66,836 students and China 63,211. Korea, Japan and Taiwan followed. 
The New York metropolitan area once again attracted the most foreign students of any urban area, 35,737, although California drew more than any other state, 78,741. It was followed by New York, Texas, Massachusetts, Florida and Illinois.
The University of Southern California passed New York University as the largest host campus, with 5,950 international students to N.Y.U.'s 5,504. Columbia University was third, with 5,116.

HEADLINE: Opposition Party Makes Strong Showing in Peru Election 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Nov. 17 

 BODY:
In a stinging setback for President Alejandro Toledo, voters today chose the country's main opposition party and a host of independents over the governing party in electing 25 new regional government bodies intended to decentralize this Andean country. 
 The results were widely viewed as a vote of no confidence in Mr. Toledo's 16-month-old government, which took office with broad support but has suffered from political disarray and image problems generated by the president's personal behavior. 
 Political experts said the big winner was Alan Garcia, a former president and Mr. Toledo's most vocal adversary. Polls of voters and early returns showed that his center-left party, the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance, or APRA, won in 11 regions, giving Mr. Garcia wide influence that would give him an advantage if, as expected, he made another presidential bid in 2006. 
"They have painted the political map," said Mirko Lauer, an influential columnist at La Republica, referring to APRA. "The APRA has won. It is not unusual, but they are the first party in the country."
Political independents, who had cast the central government as aloof and more keen on helping multinational companies than poor Peruvians, were leading in eight regions, and the traditional Union for Peru party won three. Officials of Mr. Toledo's Peru Possible party asserted this afternoon that it had won in two districts, but early results showed the party had only one victory.
Mr. Garcia, in a news conference this evening, said the victory underscored Peruvians' wish for a government sensitive to social and economic problems.
"The country as a whole seeks a policy change, a social reorientation in the government's actions, more efforts in reactivating farms and industry, and to be sure, to show more social sensibility," Mr. Garcia said.
In influential Lima, Luis Castaneda, a member of the conservative National Unity Alliance, defeated the incumbent mayor, Alberto Andrade, who was favored to win until just two weeks ago.
In an election in which voting was mandatory, 15 million Peruvians cast their ballots, electing 50 presidents and vice presidents of the new regional governments and 229 members of regional councils. More than 1,800 mayors were also elected. The new governments will receive nearly a quarter of the national budget and will be granted a range of powers that now rest with the central government.
For many Peruvians, the elections were seen as a referendum on Mr. Toledo's efforts to spur the economy by selling off state assets and putting market reforms in place. In many regions of this vast country, three times the size of California, people have raucously opposed such reforms, seeing them as benefiting foreign-based companies at their expense.
Many politicians took advantage of that sentiment. 
"We showed that Arequipa did not want any more neoliberalism," said Manuel Romero, an APRA candidate who claimed he won the mayor's office in Arequipa, Peru's second-largest city and the site of violent protests this year against privatization.
Voters seemed to ignore the fact that it was Mr. Toledo's victory in presidential elections last year that ensured the possibility of regionalization, as it is known here. 
Peru has long been a highly centralized country, with Lima holding one-third of the country's population and controlling more than half of Peru's economic output, and Mr. Toledo had strongly campaigned for the creation of regional governments to provide more power to people in the country's vast outback. 
His predecessor, President Alberto Fujimori, had ended an early attempt at regionalization during his 10-year presidency, which was marked by repression and vast corruption. Scandal forced Mr. Fujimori from office in 2000, leading to an interim government and, then, Mr. Toledo's inauguration in July 2001.
Mr. Toledo's government has seen one of the highest growth rates in Latin America, with Peru expected to increase its economic output by more than 3 percent this year. 
But his party has been mired in internal bickering and Mr. Toledo's standing has suffered from a host of personal peccadilloes, including his long denial of having fathered a child out of wedlock in the 1980's. Mr. Toledo has since admitted he is the father of Zarai Toledo, now 14.
In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Toledo ascribed his unpopularity to the tough economic decisions he has made in a country where people had been hoping for miracles after Mr. Fujimori's ouster.
"I've made difficult, hard decisions," he said in the interview. "It would be easy for me to go up to 50, 60 percent approval ratings, spending more of what we have. But that would be bread for today, hunger for tomorrow."
Many Peruvians, though, see the government as indecisive, and Mr. Toledo's popularity has also suffered from a series of broken promises. 
Michael Shifter, who tracks Peru for the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy analysis group based in Washington, said Mr. Toledo must now work on putting together a more organized party that can lead the country through the rest of his five-year term. That means working with Mr. Garcia's APRA, as well as the many independents who won today.
"This could be sort of a wake-up call to him that he's got a lot of time left in his term, and if he's going to govern effectively he's going to have to focus on the political challenges and build institutions," Mr. Shifter said. "I don't think that has been one of his priorities."

HEADLINE: And They're Off, as States Race to Add Gambling Sites 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki's plan to dot New York with new casinos, and the recent election of pro-gambling governors in neighboring states, have set the stage for a border war over gambling dollars in the Mid-Atlantic region, with New Jersey and Connecticut scrambling to protect their casino industries, and states from Massachusetts to Maryland looking for ways to get a piece of the action.
 The impetus for these moves is the promise that gambling revenues are an easy way to close the budget deficits that nearly all of the states in the region are facing, and states are rushing to complete their plans ahead of their neighbors. 
 "There is the equivalent of an arms race escalating over gambling in this region," said Bennett Liebman, coordinator of the Racing and Wagering Law Program at Albany Law School. "If video lotteries come to Aqueduct in New York and there are casinos in the Catskills, the thinking is that that requires New Jersey to take protective action in northern New Jersey. And if the casinos come to the Catskills, then will Connecticut see a need for a way to keep people in the state? Or to attract New Yorkers with a short commute to a casino in Bridgeport?" 
With his easy re-election behind him, Governor Pataki is expected to move ahead as fast as the courts allow on the law he signed in October 2001 authorizing six Indian casinos, including four in strategic border regions stretching from Niagara Falls and Buffalo to the Catskills. 
In addition, New York's law allows the installation of slot machines in at least five racing tracks, including Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens and Yonkers Raceway in Westchester.
The proposed combination of horse tracks and slot parlors have spawned a neologism, "racinos," in a continuing debate in Pennsylvania over pending legislation to authorize slots at four tracks near the state line, and even to build a new track specifically to feature slots in Erie, close to the border with New York.
The Pennsylvania venture got a boost from the election of Ed Rendell as governor, a Democrat who supported the initiative in his campaign as a way to bridge the budget gap he will face when he takes office. Pennsylvania's efforts have worried Maryland, whose new governor, Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., stressed in his campaign his support for bringing slots to Maryland racetracks to increase aid to schools and to close the state's $1.7 billion budget gap.
In Massachusetts, the departing acting governor, Jane Swift, had appointed a commission to study the possibility of casino gambling there, as a way of capturing some money being lost to Connecticut's two big casinos and that might be lost to New York's pending Catskills casinos.
The governor-elect of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney, said during his campaign that he would not rule out gambling if it would help close the state's pending $2 billion deficit. 
Even Rhode Island is thinking of getting into the act. Noting the competition nearby, its legislature declared recently that "Rhode Island has and will continue to lose millions in revenue each year to such other states unless additional gaming is authorized," and has created a commission to study the addition of casino gambling to the state's two slot machine locations.
Robert Goodman, author of "The Luck Business" and former head of the United States Gambling Research Institute, a nonprofit research group, said that governments have turned to gambling during economic downturns ever since the Great Depression, when Nevada began developing its industry.
"This looks like a free ride for them," said Professor Goodman, who teaches at Hampshire College in Massachusetts. "The problem with the rush to close these budget gaps is that they don't consider the costs from problem gamblers and other problems."
Operators of Connecticut's big casinos, Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun, along with those in Atlantic City, said they have expected other states to get into the act, and they say they will be ready to compete. 
In Atlantic City, the new $1 billion, 2,000-room Borgata hotel and casino is scheduled to open next summer, and there are plans for another casino, from MGM. Four existing casinos -- Resorts, the Tropicana, Harrah's, and Bally's -- are also expanding.
Dennis C. Gomes, president of Tropicana's resort division and the incoming head of the Casino Association of New Jersey, said that gambling in New York and slots at tracks elsewhere would only create more customers for Atlantic City. 
"You can have a casino out in the boondocks of New York or a suburban Philadelphia racetrack," he said, "but those things have nothing like the beautiful ocean and the beach and the hotels and shopping and entertainment that we have here. So we're not worried."
The rush to new gambling, particularly gambling close to New York City, has officials at northern New Jersey horse tracks worried. So, the state Sports and Exposition Authority is conducting a study to make its case for allowing slot machines at two horse tracks, the Meadowlands and Monmouth Park to help attract customers and to keep purses fat enough to compete with the tracks that have already added slots.
"We have a tremendous investment in Atlantic City, and we need to protect that investment," said the authority's chief executive, George R. Zoffinger. "But at the very same time, we have a racing industry that is being negatively impacted by slot machines at race tracks in neighboring states."
Tracks are using their gains from slots to increase their purses. The average purse at Dover Downs in Delaware has doubled, to about $16,000, since it installed slots in 1995, Mr. Zoffinger said, and New Jersey's tracks are already struggling to compete for horses and attendance. 
"If Yonkers were to get slots and increase their purse, and we can't compete, it would be the end of racing in New Jersey," Mr. Zoffinger said.
Not surprisingly, Atlantic City's casinos are energetically opposing legislation that would allow slots at northern New Jersey tracks. Most tracks that want to add slot machines are proposing to use machines called video lottery terminals, which resemble an instant payoff lottery and would presumably be allowed under state laws that permit lotteries but not slot machines. New Jersey law requires a public referendum on conventional slot machine gambling outside Atlantic City.
Opponents of New York's big gambling proposal say that calling the terminals lotteries, and not slot machines, is misleading. A coalition has already gone to court to challenge the state law authorizing the additional Indian casinos. Justice Joseph Teresi of State Supreme Court in Albany recently denied the state's motion to dismiss the suit.
The New York casinos will nominally be on Indian land, which is often land bought by a casino developer and transferred to a tribe. Park Place Entertainment, with four Atlantic City casinos, has covered its bets in the new competitive environment by taking an option to buy land at Kutsher's Country Club resort in Monticello, N.Y., that would be transferred in trust to the St. Regis Mohawk tribe, which wants to operate one of the two Catskills casinos the New York law would allow.
Similarly, last week, the Stockbridge-Munsee band of Mohican Indians of Wisconsin were given 125 acres of what they consider their ancestral lands in Stockbridge, N.Y., by Trading Cove Associates, which helped develop Mohegan Sun. 
The tribe does not have an agreement from the state for a casino, however.
Bond analysts have estimated that New York's gambling plan would generate from $300 to $400 million a year for the state and local governments, but skeptics like Professor Goodman warned that the promise of easy money can turn governments from regulators into promoters.
"I'm not opposed to gambling; I gamble myself," Professor Goodman said. "But when you have the government in the position of depending on those gambling revenues, who is going to be regulating all of this in the public interest?"

PERSON: Aubrey Solomon Eban 

HEADLINE: Abba Eban, Eloquent Defender And Voice of Israel, Is Dead at 87 

BYLINE:  By MARC D. CHARNEY 

 BODY:
Abba Eban, the erudite diplomat whose oratory and wit gained admiration and sympathy for Israel during the perilous first 30 years of its independence, died yesterday in a hospital near Tel Aviv, Foreign Ministry and hospital officials said. He was 87.
 Mr. Eban was an effective negotiator at talks that helped shape the destiny of his country in its early years, but it was his public voice and its effect on international opinion that set him apart. He gave elegant and passionate expression to Israel's right to exist, instilled pride and solidarity in the Jewish diaspora and was a formidable debater against his nation's enemies. 
 He was Israel's representative at the United Nations during the independence struggle of 1948, its ambassador to both Washington and the United Nations during the Middle East war of 1956, and its foreign minister during the 1967 and 1973 Middle East wars. 
He helped arrange a critical meeting between the Zionist patriarch Chaim Weizmann and President Harry S. Truman in the weeks before Mr. Truman decided that the United States would recognize Israeli independence in 1948. He helped negotiate a critical security guarantee for Israel during the diplomatic fiasco after the 1956 invasion of the Sinai. He was Israel's main contact with President Lyndon B. Johnson in the tense diplomacy that preceded the 1967 Middle East war, and the following year he conducted some of Israel's earliest secret contacts with King Hussein of Jordan.
Again and again during the years when Israel's survival seemed in doubt, the world's attention focused on the United Nations, where Mr. Eban, as representative of the world's only Hebrew-speaking democracy, would send his supremely cultured voice using the King's English into forensic combat. His orations, fierce in their defense of his country, were also marked by rich appeals to history, soaring visions of a peaceful Middle East and withering scorn for Israel's enemies.
He quipped famously -- and repeatedly -- that the Palestinians had a tradition of "never having lost a chance to miss an opportunity."
His speeches drew comparisons to Churchill's, and nowhere were they more appreciated than among American Jews. At a time when the traumas of Hitler's genocide and international indifference were fresh, Mr. Eban's voice gave them pride and reason for optimism.
Mr. Eban's career reached a high point in 1967. On June 19, barely a week after Israel defeated its three most powerful neighbors, occupied the West Bank, Sinai and the Golan Heights and took control of the Old City of Jerusalem, he rose at the United Nations to denounce the Egyptian blockade that had prompted the attack and President Gamal Abdel Nasser's efforts to mobilize the Arab world against Israel. The speech, a classic of his style, cast the conflict not as Israel's alone, but as the entire world's.
"The threat to Israel was a menace to the very foundations of the international order," he declared. "The state thus threatened bore a name which stirred the deepest memories of civilized mankind, and the people of the threatened state were the surviving remnant of millions, who in living memory had been wiped out by a dictatorship more powerful, through scarcely more malicious, than Nasser's Egypt."
"From these dire moments Israel emerged in five heroic days from awful peril to successful and glorious resistance." 
Rejecting any suggestion that the status quo before the war could be restored, Mr. Eban proposed that Arab acceptance of the new military facts of life could open up an idealized future: "The Middle East, tired of wars, is ripe for a new emergence of human vitality. Let the opportunity not fall again from our hands."

Diplomacy vs. Politics
It was the paradox of Mr. Eban's career that his eloquence made him more popular with Jews abroad than with Israelis. He rose almost to the top of the Labor Party, serving as a cabinet member from 1959 to 1974 -- first as minister without portfolio, then as minister of education and culture, deputy prime minister and foreign minister. But he never became prime minister.
What was commanding in the halls of diplomacy did not resonate the same way at home. His compatriots' style was rough and egalitarian. They were outgoing, not aloof like Mr. Eban, and famously rude, even in the halls of Parliament.
Increasingly, Israelis came to judge him pompous and, eventually, isolated from the political mainstream. In the 1970's, when the first generation of Labor Party leaders were passing from the scene, the more hawkish members of the new generation led by Yitzhak Rabin began to shunt him aside. In the late 1980's, the Labor Party moved to a more democratic method of nominating candidates, and Mr. Eban was dumped from the list of parliamentary candidates.
Mr. Eban was born in Cape Town, South Africa, on Feb. 2, 1915, the son of Abraham Meir Solomon, a businessman who had emigrated from Russian-held Lithuania, and his wife, Alida. When Mr. Eban was 7 months old, the family sailed for Britain. Mr. Solomon died of cancer within a year, and several years later Alida Solomon married Dr. Isaac Eban, a London physician whose surname the boy took on. He grew up as Aubrey Solomon Eban, having been given the English proper name alongside the Hebrew Abba. 
He began using Abba in his public life when he decided, during Israel's struggle for independence, to become an Israeli official; his biographer, Robert St. John, wrote in 1972 that Mr. Eban continued to use the name Aubrey in private correspondence and even among friends who were uncomfortable calling him Abba, which means father in Hebrew.

Zionism and Jewish Thought
He was steeped in Zionist values and Jewish thought from infancy. His mother worked as a secretary and translator at the offices of the Zionist Organization in London, led by Chaim Weizmann. One night in 1917 she was asked to translate the Balfour Declaration, which promised British support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, into French and Russian. "The translation of a document sounds a modest chore," Mr. Eban related in "Personal Witness," his 1992 memoir, "but it linked my family to an unforgettable drama," and added, "Zionism had conquered my inner world."
Each weekend, he was tutored in Hebrew and Jewish learning by his maternal grandfather, Eliahu Sacks. A classic British education led him to Queens' College, Cambridge, in the 1930's, where he specialized in Middle Eastern languages and literature, became expert at Arabic, took on a socialist's political outlook and was president of the Zionist Youth Movement. He also honed his wit and coined a classic Eban phrase, initially used against the Nazi information minister, Joseph Goebbels: "Every time he opens his mouth, he subtracts from the sum of human knowledge."
Mr. Eban graduated with honors in 1938 and became a lecturer in Arabic, Persian and Hebrew literature at Pembroke College, Cambridge. When World War II began, he joined the army, which trained him as an officer and, after Dr. Weizmann intervened, sent him to Cairo as a translator and censor of Arab mail and newspapers. In early 1942, with Britain fearing a German breakthrough in Egypt, he was reassigned to Palestine in a secret operation in which British officers helped train Jews as resistance fighters. The British victory at El Alamein made the effort superfluous, but the training had an unintended effect: many of the Jewish fighters would later turn the skills they learned against the British colonials as members of the Palmach, fighting for Israel's independence after the war.
During this time, Mr. Eban later wrote, he began to distance himself from the conventional wisdom about how to get along with the Arabs. He realized that an early Zionist assumption that the impoverished Arab masses would identify with the economic blessings that Jewish immigration would bring was "total nonsense."
"The idea that a nation would willingly barter its independence for economic benefits was a typical colonialist illusion," he wrote.
Mr. Eban kept this independence of mind throughout his career, particularly in his later years. Even though in office he had been one of the most effective voices denouncing the Palestine Liberation Organization and its leader, Yasir Arafat, he later criticized those who would slow or stop negotiations with the Palestinians.

Joining the Movement
After the threat of a Nazi sweep through the Middle East had passed, Mr. Eban was sent back to Cairo, where he met the woman he would marry, Shoshana Ambache, or Suzy, the daughter of an expatriate Jewish businessman from Palestine. She survives him, as do a son, Eli, and a daughter, Gila. 
The couple settled in Palestine after the war, with Mr. Eban teaching at a center for Arabic studies. While still a British officer, he began writing anonymous articles for The Palestine Post denouncing British policies that sought to limit immigration by the remnants of Europe's Jews. 
Zionist leaders pressed Mr. Eban to make their movement his career but he wavered until the summer of 1946, when anti-British violence was increasing and the authorities responded by rounding up Zionist officials. From the detention center at Latrun, Moshe Sharett smuggled out a one-word note: "Nu?" -- a Yiddish word meaning "Well?" This time Mr. Eban answered unequivocally, and with equal brevity: "Yes." He quit the British Army and signed on as an official of the Jewish Agency for Palestine.
In that role Mr. Eban helped prepare the Jewish case at the United Nations, where a weary British government had thrown the decision about the future of its Palestine Mandate. He was a member of the delegation in 1947, when the United Nations approved a plan to partition Palestine between Jews and Arabs. Two weeks before Israel proclaimed itself independent on May 14, 1948, he delivered his maiden speech -- an impassioned plea against a plan that would have replaced the mandate with a United Nations trusteeship. The speech captured wide attention and within days of independence Mr. Eban became Israel's first permanent representative at the United Nations, at 33 the youngest from any country. 
For years later, the word pictures the world would see of a beleaguered, righteous Israel were the images drawn by Mr. Eban.
"Look at the Arab map with its endless stretches of fertile land, its huge rivers yet unharnessed, its oil wells brimming with wealth and power, its manifold sovereignties and strong international representation," he told a United Jewish Appeal conference in Washington in June 1953. "Then look at Israel, developing within the smallest possible margin of territorial and economic resources available to any state and ask yourselves frankly: Are the Arab peoples the fair objects of condolence or of congratulations? Does the world owe an apology to them; or do they owe gratitude, forbearance, and moderation to the world?"
At the same time Mr. Eban was searching for a realistic understanding of the kind of relationship possible with Israel's Arab neighbors. In describing the secret meetings he held, beginning in 1968, with King Hussein, he said: "Hussein, not Sadat, was the pioneer of realism in the Arab perception of Israel. He was also the only Arab leader who absorbed a large population of Arab refugees into his society instead of letting them languish in squalid camps. But his power base was always inadequate to bring his innovations to effective expression within the larger Arab context."

From Utopianism to Realism
Mr. Eban would later describe himself as having progressed from utopianism to realism. In an interview with Thomas L. Friedman of The New York Times in 1987, he expressed particular disapproval of the rightward drift of Israeli politics at that time. "When I go abroad I still can speak for Israel in terms of its achievements," he said. "But, frankly, when I look back at the speech I gave at Israel's birth to get us into the United Nations, I would not dare make that same speech now. The rhetoric was too utopian. Now I would be much more reserved. I would definitely not use the phrase that we will be 'a light unto the nations.' "
Indeed, realism -- a belief that power and self-interest are what really determine the behavior of nations -- became the hallmark of Mr. Eban's approach to diplomacy, as the years passed.
He was at the center of action in all of the wars Israel fought, starting with the independence war of 1948, in which he helped secure a critical cease-fire that allowed hard-pressed Israeli forces to regroup and rearm.
But perhaps his greatest diplomatic achievement lay in helping to reconcile his country's interests with those of the United States in the aftermath of the 1956 war and the weeks leading up to the 1967 war. 
In the fall of 1956, when Mr. Eban was Israel's ambassador to the United States and also represented Israel at the United Nations, Israeli tanks occupied the Sinai Peninsula after Egypt had supported guerrilla raids and blocked Israeli shipping through the Red Sea. The operation had been coordinated with Britain and France, which used the Israeli seizure of Sinai as a pretext to retake the Suez Canal. The United States was furious at its NATO allies for having acted on their own, and the British and French were forced to withdraw under Soviet threats and American pressure. 
It was left to Mr. Eban to try to salvage some diplomatic advantage from his country's military success. After tortuous back-and-forth negotiations culminating in a meeting in the living room of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, he obtained terms for withdrawal that included American agreement to this principle: If Egypt were to again use Sinai to interfere with Israeli shipping through the Red Sea, Israel would have the right to act in self-defense.
Ten quiet years followed on the Israel-Sinai front, but then, in May 1967, Nasser declared such a blockade on Israeli shipping through the Red Sea. Israel had to choose between pre-empting what seemed an obvious Arab preparation for attack, or waiting in hopes of obtaining American backing or assistance. Mr. Eban, then foreign minister, flew to Paris, London and Washington. President Charles de Gaulle was cold, Prime Minister Harold Wilson dependent on American action. President Johnson insisted that Israel not act alone until the major powers had a chance to send in a convoy and flotilla to break the blockade. 
Mr. Eban helped persuade Israeli leaders to wait until the unwieldy American plan fell apart of its own impracticality; once that happened, the Americans removed their objections to Israel acting alone. Days later, on June 5, 1967, Israel unleashed the lightning attacks that ended with its capture of the Old City of Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Sinai and the Golan Heights.

A Prisoner of Victory
Writing in The Times of London in 1993, Conor Cruise O'Brien, the diplomat and writer who in the early 1960's sat next to Mr. Eban as a member of Ireland's delegation to the United Nations, called him "the most brilliant diplomatist of the second half of the 20th century." But he also said that after the 1967 war, Mr. Eban "became a prisoner of that great victory." He faded from the loop of power, Mr. O'Brien wrote, after Israel's leaders became "full of hubris as so many Israelis were from 1967 to 1973."
When the 1973 war began, it found Mr. Eban, still foreign minister, in New York. He spent the frantic days of the war in repeated consultations with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger that culminated in the American airlift of materiel that helped Israel turn the tide of battle. But within a year, both he and Prime Minister Golda Meir were out of power.
Mr. Eban passed to the sidelines, first accepting a visiting professorship at Columbia University, then returning to Israel as a member of Parliament. He took up ambitious television and writing projects, notably a nine-part public television series, "Heritage: Civilization and the Jews," on which he worked from 1979 to 1984.
Mr. Eban also wrote a book on diplomacy, "The New Diplomacy" (Heritage, 1983), and his 1992 memoir. He contributed numerous articles in which he criticized Israel's course in the Lebanon war of 1982, and urged that Israel take a conciliatory stance in negotiations with the Palestinians. 
The last political controversy in which he figured as an official was in 1987, when, as a member of a parliamentary subcommittee, he sided with Likud members in favor of a report criticizing the Labor Party leaders Shimon Peres and Mr. Rabin for their roles in using an American, Jonathan Jay Pollard, to spy on the United States. Mr. Peres and Mr. Rabin publicly rebuked him.
It was a signal of how far Mr. Eban had become distanced from his party's leadership. The next year, Mr. Eban was left off the list of candidates for Parliament.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ATOMIC ANXIETY; 
North Korean Radio Asserts Country Has Nuclear Arms

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 17 

 BODY:
North Korean state radio announced today that the country has nuclear weapons, which it said were developed to defend against attack by American imperialists.
 The broadcast appeared to be the first time that North Korea has publicly acknowledged having nuclear arms. It reflected sharply rising tensions with the United States and its East Asian allies over the cutoff of fuel supplies to the North. 
 On Thursday, the United States, Japan, South Korea and the European Union agreed to suspend the fuel oil shipments to North Korea, starting in December, in response to the country's violation of a 1994 nuclear weapons agreement.
Under the accord, known as the "Agreed Framework," North Korea deactivated a plutonium-based nuclear power operation and placed its fuel under international supervision in order to ensure that the plutonium was not being used to build bombs. In exchange, the United States, South Korea, Japan and other allies agreed to build North Korea two light-water nuclear reactors, which are less prone to be used for weapons development. In the meantime, the United States made a commitment to provide the country with 500,000 tons of heavy oil a year.
The agreement has faced cancellation since early October, when a senior State Department official, James A. Kelly, visited Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, and confronted North Korean officials with intelligence evidence that the North was secretly building a uranium-based nuclear weapons program. The next day, North Korea reportedly confirmed Mr. Kelly's assertions.
American intelligence estimates have long held that North Korea probably has two nuclear devices. Recent Chinese estimates have reportedly put that figure as high as five.
North Korea, which faces repeated famines and severe economic shortages, relies on the fuel shipments for 2 percent to 15 percent of its energy needs, according to Western estimates. The public assertion that the North possesses nuclear weapons was the first substantive response to the fuel cutoff.
The North Korean broadcast was monitored by the South Korean news agency, Yonhap, which said the language -- which appeared to go further than the North's previous claims to "be entitled to have nuclear weapons" -- might have been deliberately misleading or might even have been a rare mistake by the North Korean state broadcaster.
The broadcast was similar in tone, however, to a newspaper commentary today. 
"The United States is spreading a whopping lie that the D.P.R.K. violates the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and the D.P.R.K.-U.S. agreed framework," said an article in the Rodong Sinmun, carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency. D.P.R.K. are the initials for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
"The lie is aimed to tarnish the international prestige and authority of the D.P.R.K. and to isolate the D.P.R.K. on a worldwide scale," the newspaper said. "And it is a cunning plot to cover up the criminal nature of the U.S. posing nuclear threats to the D.P.R.K. and divert the public attention at home and abroad elsewhere."

HEADLINE: CELLPHONE SERVICE HURT BY SUCCESS 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Americans' use of cellphones has increased so quickly that wireless networks are becoming overloaded, causing a growing number of customers to complain about calls that are inaudible or are cut off or are never connected in the first place.
 And things could get worse before they get better, industry experts say, because even as cellphone companies are rolling out fancy features like digital photography and Internet-based games, they are hard-pressed to spend the money needed to improve basic service. 
 "This is a situation in which the wireless industry is a victim of its own success," said James D. Schlichting, a deputy chief of the wireless communications bureau at the Federal Communications Commission.
Many of the industry's service problems are a result of a huge growth of new customers. In 56 percent of the nation's households, someone now subscribes to wireless phone service, more than double the percentage in 1995. 
The surge in users is overwhelming the capacity to handle calls on wireless systems -- whether because local transmitters are too few or too small, or because the local airwaves have become too crowded and carriers are unable to obtain larger swaths of radio frequencies. 
The problems are compounded by basic economics. Customers have been attracted by the plunge in prices for wireless service. The average per-minute cost has dropped to 11 cents this year from 56 cents in 1995. For the phone companies that has meant a decline in average revenue per customer to $61 a month, from $74 in 1995.
And so, just when the wireless companies need to invest more money to accommodate all those new users, the companies are under increased financial strain.
As a result, the complaints are piling up.
The F.C.C. tracks only the few hundred complaints it receives each quarter -- it recently reported fewer than in past years -- but acknowledges that an increase in subscribers had worsened service problems. And surveys conducted for the industry itself show that complaints are rising.
"If I make 10 calls, at least three have to be redialed because they don't go through," said Orville Mills, who lives near Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx and recently switched carriers to Sprint from T-Mobile. "The new services are just a distraction from not having the basics down."
The percentage of all wireless subscribers who have called customer-service centers at least once in the last year to complain about service or because they had other problems has climbed to 61 percent, from 53 percent in 2000, according to J. D. Power & Associates, a company that measures customer satisfaction in many industries and sells it to the companies being scrutinized.
The level of such calls is higher than for many other consumer-service providers, including land-line telephone companies, cable-television operators and stockbrokers, according to Power. About 30 percent of the calls to customer-service centers were complaints related to dropped calls, bad reception or calls not going through, up from 19 percent in 2000. Other reasons included complaints and questions about billing, equipment and services.
The author of the study, Kirk Parsons, said the wireless companies are aware of the problem. He said he expected complaints to grow as the companies add new services, contributing to stress on the networks and subscribers' confusion.
"It's important to remember that cellphones are glorified radios," said Travis Larson, a spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, the wireless industry's main trade group. "They're subject to interference from a lot of things, from building walls to sunspots to the weather. There will always be a trade-off between mobility and call quality."
Meanwhile, the stock prices of AT&T Wireless Services and Sprint PCS, the two largest stand-alone publicly traded carriers, are down more than 45 percent this year on investor concern about revenues. And the two largest carriers, Verizon Wireless and Cingular Wireless, which are controlled by regional Bell companies, are struggling to find and pay for additional swaths of airwaves to carry calls.
The industry received something of a financial reprieve last Thursday from the Federal Communications Commission, which ruled that wireless companies would not have to pay the $16 billion they had offered for additional airwave licenses during a bidding process that is now being contested. The licenses had been seized by the F.C.C. from NextWave Communications and auctioned after NextWave filed for bankruptcy protection. But the licenses, and the airwave capacity they represent, are tied up by NextWave's appeal of that seizure, which is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Another industry problem is the sheer technical complexity of sending and receiving wireless calls. Unlike conventional telephone systems, in which every customer is hardwired to the network, wireless systems rely on a delicate mesh of thousands of antenna towers -- which often face resistance from local governments -- and cellular relay stations.
The stations can easily be flooded by an increase in calling volumes. That vulnerability became clear in the hours after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, when the local wireless networks were effectively shut down by the surge of attempted calls.
Various new companies are trying to develop towers and other forms of transmission technologies that could handle such surges. But so far carriers remain reliant on systems that, in some ways, still resemble radio communications networks that were first developed in World War II.
Because of brisk demand, financial problems at wireless carriers are not as severe as those in other areas of telecommunications, where large companies like WorldCom and Global Crossing have sought bankruptcy protection. Even so, some investors think the only way to ensure industry stability will be to winnow the competing wireless players. Instead of six nationwide carriers, they say, a more economically feasible number might be three or four.
"Consolidation among wireless companies can't fix these problems, but it can make them less severe," said Frank J. Governali, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs.
For months, investors have been waiting for mergers that would shrink the number of large competitors. No deals have yet materialized, though, partly because of technical obstacles. Unlike nations in Europe and Asia with higher wireless usage rates, the United States does not have a single wireless technical standard that would make it easy for carriers with different systems to combine operations.
Verizon and Sprint, for instance, employ an American-designed standard called code division multiple access, or C.D.M.A. Meanwhile, AT&T Wireless, Cingular Wireless and T-Mobile, formerly known as VoiceStream, use the global system for mobile communications, or G.S.M. format, common in Europe and Asia. Another large American carrier, Nextel, uses its own technology, called Iden.
Carriers have also resisted measures that would make the industry more consumer-friendly. In response to industry lobbying, for example, the F.C.C. has postponed until next fall a deadline for companies to start allowing "number portability" -- letting customers keep their cellphone numbers even when they switch providers. The companies are reluctant to implement the measure, fearing it will create new costs while also encouraging customer defections.
"I've had the same number for three years," said Sarah Vanderslice, a student at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York who subscribes to Sprint's service. "The fear of losing it is the only thing that keeps me from dropping my cellular company."
The F.C.C. has also repeatedly extended the industry's deadlines for improving emergency-call abilities for wireless phones. Calls from cellphones are still much more difficult for emergency officials to pinpoint than calls from land-line phones. And the issue has become more pressing as the number of emergency calls from cellphones has grown to the current rate of more than 30 percent of 911 calls.
"The wireless industry is in need of a stricter taskmaster," said David Heim, the managing editor of Consumer Reports magazine, which publishes an annual feature each year on cellular service problems. Although the F.C.C. has jurisdiction on certain operational matters, the wireless industry remains largely unregulated.
But few people expect the Bush administration's F.C.C. to try to exert significant new authority. And even a former F.C.C. chairman from the Clinton years says that, in the main, it would be prudent to avoid more regulation.
"We have a robustly competitive wireless industry," said Reed E. Hundt, the former F.C.C. chairman, who is now a senior adviser on information technologies for the management consultant firm McKinsey & Company. "Younger people recognize this in opting for wireless over wire line and putting up with some flaws in exchange for freedom of movement."
Like their counterparts in Europe, carriers in the United States are hoping new services like text messaging and transmission of digital photos will eventually generate the additional revenue they need to put their finances on stronger footing. But aside from a small but loyal following of mainly younger subscribers that exchange text messages, none of the new services have attracted a large number of users.
And anyone who expects competitive market forces to quickly improve cellphones may be overly optimistic, some experts say. They note that the conventional wired telephone system has been evolving for more than a century and became widely dependable only in recent decades.
"Don't hold your breath," said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst in Atlanta. "Service and the economic evolution of wireless are works in progress -- it might be years before customers are truly satisfied."

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL; 
Knicks Are Off Their Game, and the A-List

BYLINE:  This article was reported by Alan Feuer, Seth Schiesel and Mike Wise and was written by Mr. Feuer. 

 BODY:
The court was crowded with second-stringers. So was celebrity row.
 Missing from the Knicks' starting lineup were Latrell Sprewell, Charlie Ward and Antonio McDyess. The faithful had to root for Howard Eisley, Frank Williams and Michael Doleac -- a scrub, a rookie and a man nobody knows. 
 Missing from the stands were Spike Lee, Sean Combs, Tom Brokaw and the Baldwin brothers. The stargazers had to settle for lesser lights: Lou Gossett Jr., Matthew Modine and Tom Cavanagh, from the TV series "Ed." 
It seemed a far cry from the jump-shot-and-martini days of the 1990's, when a Knicks ticket was the hottest thing in town and the Lincoln Continentals were parked three-deep on Seventh Avenue an hour before the game. When the Chicago Bulls came around back then, the titans clashed: Jordan versus Ewing, Jackson versus Riley. There was a purr of money, a glamorous hum. Madison Square Garden buzzed with an ionic charge.
These days, after 433 consecutive sellouts, the Garden is no longer packed to the rafters every night. Woody Allen still shows up, but he sits yawning and crossing his arms. The dancing girls get more applause than the players. People leave at halftime. People boo.
"There's no joy in Mudville," sighed Spike Lee, a rabid fan, who missed the game on Tuesday night with the Utah Jazz. He was working and was glad to have been working. The Knicks were crushed by more than 20 points.
"Back in the day," Lee recalled, "I was so hyped about the games I'd get to the Garden even before the players showed up. Now, we're the laughingstock of the league."
With a budget crisis looming and a gaping hole in the ground downtown, New York would seem to have more pressing problems than the Knickerbockers and their sorry 1-8 start. Do not, however, dismiss the power of basketball.
"It's on a lot of people's minds," Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said. He told this story: Someone saw him on the No. 6 train last week and shouted, of all things, "Fix the Knicks!" as the doors began to close.
There are, of course, fallow and fertile periods in basketball and all professional sports, but fixing today's Knicks will not be easy, given the management's string of questionable decisions and the team's remarkable bad luck. The Knicks failed to make the playoffs last season for the first time in 15 years and now dwell in the basement of the Eastern Conference.
Instead of patiently rebuilding with draft picks, for years the Knicks have chosen a Band-Aid strategy, plastering their wounds with overpaid, over-age and often injury-plagued players. They have tried hard to spend themselves out of their problems, amassing one of the largest payrolls in the National Basketball Association at $93 million.
The result is that under the league's salary cap, they are virtually unable to add any more top-flight veterans.
The Knicks are not the worst team in the N.B.A. -- the Memphis Grizzlies are 0-10 -- but they could be in the worst predicament.
"A team can sell one of two things: wins or hope," said a Western Conference general manager, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "If you have a veteran team with a high payroll, you're selling wins. And if you're playing young guys, you're selling hope."
The Knicks, however, are aged and losing, and their selections of young players in the annual draft have almost universally been poor. They sell neither victory nor hope.
James L. Dolan, the Garden's chairman, contended in an interview on Friday that the Knicks still had an innate attraction and were building a promising future.
"If you love basketball, we're still going to be a fun team to watch," he said. "For those people who only come to games because they believe the team is going to win the championship that year, they probably had best get a ticket to Los Angeles. But for those who are loyal Knick fans and who love New York, this is still the New York Knicks. And it's still going to be a great way to spend an evening."
If the Knicks' free fall is nothing new in the N.B.A., there is still a sense that fans in other cities with losing squads can take it better than New Yorkers. After all, basketball is part of the city's swagger.
"This is where the mystery of basketball comes from," said John Bykowsky, director of the New York Urban Professionals Athletic League. "Where have all the great players come from? The ones with all the moves that everyone's talking about? The streets of New York City. That's why it's so unbearable to see the Knicks playing like this."

The Decline
A Table at Elaine's, Then a Fateful Trade
A decade ago, the Knicks were perennial underdogs, and the city loved them. They were scrappy, muscular, resolute. They were New Yorkers.
Although they never won a title in the 1990's, they were often in the running, playing twice for the championship, and their flair for gritty games thrilled the hometown crowd even if they lost.
Moored by Patrick Ewing at center, the Knicks had a bruising forward in Charles Oakley and a hair-trigger shooting guard in John Starks. When the lights dimmed at the Garden and the home-team players were announced, the place erupted with a booming, chesty roar.
"What an exhilarating moment, walking out onto that floor with the city behind you," Pat Riley, the Knicks' coach from 1991 to 1995, recalled last week. "It was the time and the place."
The party often went on well past the game. Slicked-back and stylish, Riley turned up after games at Elaine's on the Upper East Side with his wife. A spot was reserved for them in back. The penne was always al dente, the sauce tomato cream.
On some nights, the coach was joined by Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin, along with any number of other famous faces. "Name after name would show up," Riley said. "Mira Sorvino. Ashley Judd. Winona Ryder. You would go in, sprinkle your stardust around and go home. That's what it was like."
When Riley left for Miami, he took the stardust with him. His assistant Jeff Van Gundy, who eventually became the Knicks' coach, was a different sort of man, a sleep-deprived workaholic and one of the most pessimistic people in sports. A framed quote in his office read: "If you think they are all out to get you, you're not paranoid -- you're perceptive."
Although Van Gundy went on to preside over more victories with the Knicks than Riley did, he was there when the team began its slide. It started in September 2000, essentially with a single move: Ewing, unhappy and in the last year of his contract, was sent to Seattle in a three-way trade for Glen Rice, Luc Longley and Travis Knight.
"It all started when they traded Patrick," Lee said with a catch in his voice. "That's when the curse began."
Had the Knicks kept Ewing another season and let him go as a free agent, they would have lopped his $16 million salary from their payroll. Instead, they were saddled with his replacements' expensive long-term contracts, worth a total of $90.4 million, leaving them with almost no flexibility under the salary cap. Knicks officials note, however, that even if Ewing had played out his contract and left the following season, the team would still have been over the salary cap.
A few additional moves sent the Knicks' payroll through the ceiling and their fortunes through the floor. In July 2001, they signed Allan Houston to a six-year, $100.4 million contract when the most he could have received on the free-agent market was $72 million. The following month, they traded Rice in a three-team deal for two high-priced reserves: Eisley and Shandon Anderson, whose long-term contracts totaled $83 million. 
The knockout punch, however, was Van Gundy's startling resignation last December. Citing personal reasons, he left the team with a 10-9 record. Under Don Chaney, the assistant coach who replaced him, the Knicks finished 30-52.
Nevertheless, there was a glimmer of hope in June when the team traded Marcus Camby, Mark Jackson and a No. 7 draft pick, Maybyner Hilario, to Denver for McDyess, the All-Star power forward.
During a preseason game last month, McDyess rose to slam in a missed shot and landed awkwardly, falling on his surgically repaired left knee. His kneecap was fractured, and he is not expected to play this season.
A few weeks earlier, Sprewell shocked his teammates by showing up at training camp with a broken finger -- injured, he said, in a fall on his boat. He was fined $250,000 for failing to notify the club promptly, and he underwent surgery, followed by weeks of rehabilitation.
Although Sprewell played for the first time this season Saturday in a game against the Philadelphia 76ers, scoring 16 points, it was not enough to gain the Knicks a victory, or to draw A-list celebrities. Pearl Jam was the boldest name in the crowd.
Sprewell's troubles, McDyess's absence and minor injuries to Houston, Charlie Ward and Kurt Thomas have left the Knicks looking like a pickup team in the early weeks of the season. Their current hope for the future, many have said, may lie with landing the first pick in the draft next spring and choosing LeBron James, a high-school phenomenon from Akron, Ohio.
A similar circumstance brought Ewing to the team in 1985, when the Knicks were one of the league's worst teams. While a repeat of that scenario seems a bit far-fetched, at least a far-fetched fantasy provides a whiff of hope.

Management
An Enthusiastic Fan Takes the Reins
Dolan, chairman of the Garden and president of Cablevision, which owns the arena and its teams, has always fashioned himself as a fan of New York sports. He once spoke of the grandeur of the Garden. Last year, he rented out a hotel ballroom during a trip to Cleveland, racing miniature cars with his players to break the tension of a long season.
At the same time, Dolan has been criticized for the way he handled a variety of incidents with Sprewell. Many fans have questioned whether Dolan has the expertise to run the team and have criticized him for supporting the team's president and general manager, Scott Layden, who has been skewered almost daily in the news media for his personnel decisions.
Last season, Sprewell skipped a pregame shoot-around in Miami. The Knicks fined him $125,000, but Dolan reduced it to $2,500.
In rescinding the fine, Dolan asked for only one thing in return: that Sprewell stay in touch with the team during the off-season, as other players do. Sprewell is notoriously impossible to track down.
Sprewell's contact, however, was minimal. The first time he appeared, in fact, was on media day, Sept. 30, when he showed up with a broken finger. Officials familiar with the situation said Dolan was irate. That was the major reason Sprewell was fined $250,000 and banished from practicing with the team.
Dolan's unwavering support for Layden and Chaney has puzzled many Knicks fans. What remains unclear is whether Dolan believes they are the right men to see the Knicks through a trying time, whether he thinks he must support his management team in public or whether he is trying to avoid firing Layden and absorbing the remainder of his contract while paying Chaney a fraction of what some of his predecessors made.
For all his enthusiasm as a fan, Dolan has occasionally failed to grasp the fundamentals of Knicks history. He once referred to Red Holzman, the legendary Knicks coach, as Red Auerbach, who coached the Boston Celtics. Not only did he confuse his Reds, he confused them in front of Holzman's daughter, Gail, unaware that Holzman and Auerbach were mortal rivals.
In the interview Friday, Dolan described himself as a lifelong Knicks fan who would take the D train to the old Garden for games. As chairman of the Garden now, he said he took a hands-on approach to running the team, but deferred on personnel and other basketball matters to his coach and general manager.
He admitted that the Knicks did not look good, although he contended that injuries, not poor decisions, were to blame. And he argued that, over all, the team was moving in a positive direction.
"I think we're getting younger and I think we're progressing," Dolan said. "We obviously have suffered setbacks, and a start that is one I don't think anybody in the league would envy. And you know, there are reasons for it. We've been riddled with injuries."

Finances
Lavish Spending Has Its Consequences
Cablevision, which Dolan controls, has spent much of the last few months cutting costs. It closed 26 of its 43 Wiz electronics stores. It put its chain of movie theaters up for sale. It cut more than 2,000 jobs.
The company's shares have soared with the news, more than tripling to close at $16.26 Friday, up from $4.67 in mid-August.
The Knicks' collapse does not appear to be related to the cost-cutting. Paradoxically, it seems the team's decline has stemmed from Cablevision's financial interest in keeping it competitive.
It is not unusual for a sports team to go through periods of rebuilding, sacrificing victories to finish low in the standings, all to gain a high draft pick around which to build for the future. Rebuilding is especially important in leagues with salary caps like the N.B.A. The idea is simple: suffer losses, save money and maneuver for one or two top draft picks.
The Knicks, however, have refused to rebuild. They have consistently acquired expensive veteran players meant to help the team win immediately.
Dave Checketts, who once ran the Garden, used to say openly that he did not think New Yorkers had the patience to endure a rebuilding period. A person close to Cablevision said team officials continued to pursue that strategy because "they thought that New York would not tolerate a rebuilding team." From a financial standpoint, however, it seems that Cablevision, too, would find it hard to tolerate rebuilding.
In addition to controlling the Knicks, Cablevision also controls the MSG cable television network, which telecasts most of the Knicks' games to about eight million homes. Financial analysts say that the Knicks may only break even, and that the team makes its real money on the MSG network. Dolan confirmed that analysis.
"There is more of a premium on success because if the Knicks are successful, they get a double hit," said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College. "They get a hit through Knicks revenue, and they also get a hit through Cablevision revenue."
The general belief among analysts of the media industry is that Cablevision has chosen the quick fix to justify increasing MSG's subscriber fees, or at least stabilizing them. This season, MSG lost the Yankees to the YES network, making it even more important to create a competitive Knicks team.
"Cablevision only cares about having a product good enough to justify the subscriber rates it was charging," said Richard A. Bilotti, the head media stock analyst at Morgan Stanley. "The fan would have wanted them to restructure the team two years ago and rebuild like the Celtics. For years, Cablevision propped up the channel with expensive free-agent additions to keep the team just good enough so it would go to the playoffs."
The upshot of the quick-fix strategy is that the Knicks now appear to have nowhere to turn. The team committed so much money to so many second-tier players with long-term contracts that it is finding it difficult to trade those players to other teams.
"Because they never rebuilt the team," Bilotti said, "they kept putting off the inevitable. And now the inevitable is happening anyway, which is that the team is really horrible."
The horror was evident at Tuesday night's game. The first boo came with 24 seconds left in the first quarter. The first profound boo came with 1 minute 19 seconds left in the second quarter. The first flagrantly obnoxious boo came 15 minutes later.
Wearily, Lee recalled a remark uttered by Micheal Ray Richardson, a guard for the flaccid Knicks teams of the 1980's: "The ship be sinking."
"Well, I'm going to update that," Lee said. "I'm going to say, 'The ship be sunk.' "

HEADLINE: The Angels Have Sung So 'Harlem Song' Lives 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
The producers of "Harlem Song" at the Apollo Theater, who two weeks ago said the show would have to close before the end of its scheduled run unless they could raise $300,000, said yesterday that they had raised that much and a little more, adding that the show would run through December as planned.
 "Harlem Song," created by George C. Wolfe, chronicles the history of Harlem through music, dance, filmed interviews and historic photographs. It posted a closing notice last month because it was running at a loss, and the producers said they felt they could not afford to keep it open. 
 Among the groups that stepped up to sustain the show is the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, which had previously denied the "Harlem Song" application for $1.2 million in financing that its producers had requested. 
John Schreiber, the lead producer, said the additional funds would allow him and his partners to cover running costs of $200,000, to market the show more extensively and to bring it back next year. 
The producers created "Harlem Song" in the hope that it would become an annual event at the Apollo Theater, like the Radio City Christmas Spectacular. 
The $4 million show, performed Saturdays through Mondays, had been running at a loss since it opened in August, most recently about $30,000 a week. "Harlem Song" used up its $500,000 reserve as well as $750,000 from the Time Warner Foundation and the New York City Investment Fund, a private fund started by Henry R. Kravis. 
Although the show had generated more than $2 million in ticket revenue and an estimated $4 million in ancillary retail and restaurant income in the area, it still had difficulty drawing theatergoers uptown in sufficient numbers to break even.
"Organizations came together in a terrific and public-spirited way to help fulfill the promise of the show's first year and help ensure its future," Mr. Schreiber said.
The show had also been considered an important addition to Harlem's revitalization and to the Apollo's current $53 million restoration. 
Mr. Schreiber said Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem was among those who had been helpful. "All these different people -- members of the board -- came together in a unanimous and bipartisan way and said this show is important to the community," Mr. Schreiber said. "It was a great vote of confidence for us."
Kathryn Wilde, the president and chief executive of the New York City Investment Fund and its parent, the New York City Partnership, said: "We felt both symbolically and in terms of the benefits to the local economy that an original production showcased at the Apollo really makes a difference. Having this particular show playing there really sent the message loud and strong to the community that the renaissance of Harlem was based on the continued contribution from black culture."
The other donors, some of which Ms. Wilde's organization helped to secure, include the Rockefeller Foundation; the Citigroup Foundation; Goldman, Sachs & Company; Merrill Lynch & Company; and the Wolfensohn Family Foundation. Additional financing is being provided by the Sony Foundation, H.I.P. of New York and the Vornado Realty Foundation. 
"The investment is intended to establish this as a successful and hopefully annual production," Ms. Wilde said, "to give them the chance to show they can fill the theater and establish a track record so they can attract support in the future."

HEADLINE: OVERSEAS; 
Flash Points Loom In War on Hunger

BYLINE:  By DANIEL B. SCHNEIDER 

 BODY:
OVER the last decade, the news about world hunger has not been all bad.
 On the plus side, the number of people who are chronically undernourished or starving dropped by 20 million during the 1990's, according to a recent report from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 On the minus side are two grim facts: the overall number is still huge -- 840 million -- and the strong gains in a relatively small number of countries, notably China, must be measured against a steady slide in the 47 worst-off countries. These are mostly in Africa, where the ranks of the hungry grew by 96 million.
At the moment, the news is particularly disheartening. The World Food Program, a United Nations agency and the world's largest food distribution organization, "has probably never had as many serious challenges as we have today," said James T. Morris, the executive director of the agency. 
As a matter of perspective, it should be noted that the percentage of undernourished people in most developing countries has actually decreased, while the absolute number has risen largely as a result of population growth. And while prospects are bleak in sub-Saharan Africa, Central America and the Middle East, both the prevalence and the amount of undernourished people have been reduced, in some cases drastically, in West Africa, Southeast Asia and South America since the 1990's. 
But droughts and famines unfold almost in slow motion, and emergency relief must often wait until after the effects of a food shortage become evident and intrusive. In the interim, the suffering worsens. "Those disasters that receive the highest profile, the most attention in the media, receive the most support," Mr. Morris said. "It's not surprising. The more the world knows about what's going on, the more the world responds." 
Donors in the United States have responded to crises in Africa for years, but there are indications that fatigue is setting in. It is the wrong moment. An extraordinary famine is threatening six nations in southern Africa, where more than 14 million people could face starvation in the next year. 
Though primarily a result of years of drought alternating with devastating floods, this current drought, the worst in a decade, hits a rural population already decimated by the H.I.V.-AIDS epidemic. In the countries facing mass starvation -- Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe -- an infection rate of one in five people is typical, and half of those infected are employed in farming. Many households are without one or both parents.
"It's devastating," Mr. Woods said. "You put serious weather problems in a place with four and a half million orphans, and those people have just lost their coping mechanisms." 
THE catastrophe has been compounded by government mismanagement and political turmoil in several of the afflicted countries. The government of Malawi sold its grain reserves last year. The new government in Zambia alleges that the previous administration misappropriated state food supplies. 
In Zimbabwe, once a model of self-sufficiency, President Robert Mugabe's politically charged efforts to seize land from white farmers have resulted in a huge drop in crop production, leaving almost half the population needing emergency aid. 
Poor rainfall over the last year has also decimated cereal crops in the Horn of Africa. As many as 12 million people are threatened with starvation in Ethiopia and Eritrea in the coming months, only two years after widespread famine was last averted by an infusion of international food assistance. Aid workers have already compared the current crisis to the Ethiopian famine of 1984, when almost a million people died.
With much of the developing world, the effects of armed conflict have intensified the effects of a natural calamity. Because of the recent border war between Eritrea and Ethiopia, which simmered from 1998 to 2000, vast swaths of land cannot be farmed for fear of land mines, and conscription to military service has depleted the agricultural work force in many areas, adding to food insecurity at the household level. 
In Ethiopia, the number of people who need food aid is expected to rise to 10 million to 14 million next year from the current 6 million. Recent assessment missions reveal widespread losses of maize and sorghum, staples in rural areas, which are harvested green and eaten during lean seasons, in addition to reduced sources of pasture and water for livestock. 
"We have started distributing food in affected areas early enough to contain the crisis, but if we don't get more pledges quickly, aid agencies' relief stocks will run out before December and the situation will deteriorate rapidly," said Georgia Shaver, a representative of the World Food Program, in a recent report.
Poverty in Eritrea is so pervasive that virtually the entire country is susceptible to food shortages. More than a million people -- about a third of Eritrea's population -- are said to be threatened by the current crisis. 
North Korea's long slide into widespread malnutrition began in 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed and its satellite states stopped providing food and economic aid. Since 1995, floods, droughts and tropical storms have multiplied the country's misery, and it is widely thought that barring political, economic and agricultural reforms, it will be years before North Korea will be able to feed its citizens.
Between 1994 and 1998 at least two million North Koreans were reported to have died from starvation and related diseases. According to the most recent World Food Program studies, at least 45 percent of children under 5 are malnourished, while four million school-age children are also severely underfed, impairing their capacity to grow physically and mentally. 
THE United States, a longtime principal donor, has diverted substantial food aid from North Korea to meet demands in Afghanistan, and other countries are also scaling back donations. Neither the recently exposed attempts of North Korea to develop a nuclear weapons program, nor the longstanding suspicions that food aid is hoarded by the government, are likely to improve the situation. 
Though agricultural production is up for the second straight year, North Korea is more than a million tons short of its minimum food needs. The slump in grain donations forced the World Food Program, which has been feeding about a third of the country's 23 million people, to begin halting food aid in September to millions of malnourished women, children and older people. By the end of the year, about three million people will be cut off from aid, and another 1.5 million are expected to follow early next year. 
"We simply no longer have the resources to do the things we need to do," Mr. Morris said. 
The problems in Afghanistan are also manifold, despite the surprising success of aid efforts over the last year and a pronounced recovery in agricultural production in some areas. Roiled by two decades of war and scorched by a four-year drought, the country is mired in an extended crisis, its rural economy in a shambles and its essential services all but nonexistent. 
The years of drought have had a damaging effect on range vegetation, thinning critical livestock herds as much as 60 percent since 1998. The unanticipated return of almost two million refugees since last year has outstripped both the capacities and the financing of the relief agencies, and the situation may worsen over the winter, when approximately two million people living in areas that will be rendered inaccessible by heavy snows or cold will be particularly vulnerable. 
Severe undernourishment has not spared the Americas. Malnutrition is spreading through rural areas of the Central American "drought corridor," where rains faltered during the May to August planting and harvesting seasons. The region is also recovering from recent natural disasters, like the mudslides in Guatemala last August. 
Residents are extremely poor, living on infertile land, and the recent glut of coffee in world markets has removed a steady source of additional household income. The World Food Program estimates that about 1.5 million people are threatened with malnutrition in Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador.
Earlier this year, with little fanfare, the World Food Program delivered emergency food aid to 6,000 children in Guatemala who were acutely malnourished and near death, the accumulative effect of two years of drought and rural unemployment. "We have to work very hard at telling the story," Mr. Morris said. "The world can't respond if they don't know about it."

HEADLINE: THE ARTS; 
New Jersey's Arts Center: 5 Years of Hybrid Success

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS 

 BODY:
LAWRENCE P. GOLDMAN, the president and chief executive of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, which just celebrated its fifth birthday, says that he has always felt the need to be upfront with potential donors about what the center is, and what it isn't. 
 The center, known as NJPAC, is not Lincoln Center. It draws big names but does not automatically attract the biggest. It is not an automatic moneymaker, nor are there millionaires fighting for a spot on its board. But the center is a success in terms of the goals it set at inception, ones that illustrate the many purposes a nonprofit arts center can serve. 
 Early on, NJPAC decided it was to be something of a hybrid. "They did not dub themselves a cultural institution alone," but as an investment in Newark as well, said Elizabeth Strom, an assistant professor of political science at Rutgers University in Newark who studies cultural financing. 
Ray Chambers, a co-owner of the New York Yankees and the New Jersey Nets, who is an active philanthropist for urban causes "gave several million dollars, and I don't think he gave to cultural institutions like that before," Professor Strom said. "The Prudential Foundation doesn't have a large cultural donation in its portfolio. They certainly went for cultural donors, but then they also went out and found people to invest in Newark, too."
Prudential Financial has its name on the main concert hall; Prudential's president and chief executive, Arthur F. Ryan, is a co-chairman of the board of trustees. His company, he said, became a big donor for somewhat selfish reasons. "I love our hall," he said. "It is a beautiful space. But Prudential has been in Newark for nearly 130 years and that was the compelling reason for us to be a part of this. 
"What you need is to have people come to the city to live and to work," Mr. Ryan said. "And to do that, you have to have a great sense of pride. We have world-class arts here now, but the facility has also created an uptick in Class A office space and more commercial development. That is what we were hoping for."
The bulk of the original money for the building, more than 60 percent of the $187 million, came from federal and state economic development funds. Ms. Strom compared the use of such money to the approach that was taken by Ed Rendell, a former mayor of Philadelphia (and the newly elected governor of Pennsylvania), which led to the building of the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts there.
"Until Ed Rendell called it an urban development project, it was on the drawing board for 20 years," Ms. Strom said. 
If busy evenings are a sign of success, NJPAC is rolling along. The 135 scheduled performances this year range from the New Jersey Symphony to the pop-diva Lauryn Hill. The center has the sixth-largest budget of all arts centers in the United States. To make that budget, which is $23 million this year, about $11 million in grants, subscriptions and donations must be raised. Tickets, T-shirts, food concessions and educational fees make up slightly more than half the money that is needed to stage those shows and hold workshops. 
Even the successful concerts are not necessarily a lot of money in the bank. "We had Lauryn Hill here," said Jeffrey Norman, the center's vice president of public affairs. "New Jersey artist. Sold out 2,750 seats in 41 minutes. We made all of $2,000 on that show. Symphony concerts can lose money. The economics of the arts can be difficult to understand."
Ms. Strom said that Ms. Hill's concert may have been, in some ways, a loss leader. "Did they sell more NJPAC mugs or T-shirts?" she asked. "I don't know. But they certainly got an audience that normally wouldn't be at a symphony hall. So, maybe they will come back."
While the audience that came to Ms. Hill's concert may not contain future big donors, the concert and the other educational projects and events like Planet Hip-Hop, a festival that took place earlier this month, can translate into big money. The center is two years into a four-year $1.25 million grant from the Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund for young organizations providing diversity in their programming.
"We look for organizations paving new ground in reaching new people and engaging them more deeply, and clearly NJPAC is doing that," said Rory MacPherson, the senior program officer at the Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund. Mr. MacPherson pointed to a program where Reg E. Gaines, the creator of "Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk," worked with women in the community, creating a spoken-word work called "Brick City Blues," based on their experiences.
"This kind of thing brings a tremendous impact that other places just don't match," Mr. MacPherson said.
Another reflection of how successful the center's business strategy has been can be found in the growing commitment of a large donor at the other end of the music spectrum. Josh S. Weston, a longtime lover of classical music, said he was upset with his peers in the New Jersey elite. 
"I had seen some list and it showed that New Jersey ranked 48th among the states in the percentage that wealthy people give to charity and cultural institutions," said Mr. Weston, a retired chairman and chief executive of Automated Data Processing, a business services company in Roseland, N.J. "I became determined to find jewels in New Jersey to mine."
Still, Mr. Weston was a bit of a skeptic early on, Mr. Goldman recalled. "It was Newark and we were new. Sometimes, in order to raise money from good people, you have to prove yourself in many ways."
The center has evidently proven itself to Mr. Weston. Last year, he told Mr. Goldman, the NJPAC chief executive, that he and his wife, Judy, would give $5 million if Mr. Goldman could find two matching donors. Because the center needs to cover $11 million of its $23 million annual budget with grants and donations, and keep a capital fund in reserve, Mr. Weston's potential gift was important.
"I could have just written a check, but I wanted to get more mileage," he said. 
Mr. Goldman and his development staff loved the idea of Mr. and Mrs. Weston's challenge and eventually got two New Jersey foundations, the Victoria Foundation and the Jon and Joanne Corzine Foundation, to match his $5 million. But Mr. Weston did not want to stop there. He pushed the State Legislature to create the New Jersey Cultural Trust. Formed last year, the trust matches any donation of $100,000 with a similar state grant to qualified cultural institutions. "The state should do its share, too," Mr. Weston said.
The arts center also goes through some traditional channels to raise money. Despite the hip nature of some of its programs, it has the Women's Board, which holds an annual ball (this year's raised $2.5 million) and asks for donations from women in northern New Jersey. The center estimates that 75 percent of tickets to its events are bought by women.
"We had Lionel Richie at our gala this year and it was wonderful," said Barbara Bell Coleman, who owns a business consulting firm, BBC Associates, and is the current president of the Women's Board. "But the point of it is that we are doing something to uplift the whole community here."
Ms. Coleman grew up in Newark and continues to live there. She thinks the center's relationship with the city has changed. "It was definitely important that NJPAC was in Newark, but I think it doesn't matter any more," Ms. Coleman said. "Now people come here just because it is the event they want to see. That, in turn, gets us more customers and, then, more donations."
"We are an established arts group now," she said. "I think we can count on people willing to give for a long time."

HEADLINE: Metro Matters; 
Your Taxes At Play . . . For the Knicks

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
WHAT we're trying to do is say that everybody that works in the city benefits from all of the services -- the Fire Department, for example," Mayor Bloomberg said. "And it is only equitable that everybody pays some share of that."
 So declared the mayor last week on the subject of his tough budget, and while it does seem that his plan goes easier on the wealthy than on the poor, at least his words embrace the idea of shared sacrifice. And who would argue against that? 
 Therefore, a question or two about the city's well-aged policy of granting tax abatements, subsidies and other incentives to businesses to keep them in town.
No doubt that some of the deals help the city by retaining companies, preserving jobs and generating new business. A range of businesses have gotten incentives, from banks and insurance firms to media companies -- including The New York Times, which is preparing to build a new headquarters on Eighth Avenue.
There is also a counterargument that some companies would have stayed anyway -- especially when the city was booming in the 1990's. Another point: some benefits seem to go on and on -- extended with little debate -- even if that was not the original intent.
Take Madison Square Garden. In 1982, the Koch administration faced a threat that the Knicks would leave for the Nassau Coliseum and the Rangers for the Meadowlands. To a city still recovering from the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, it was unthinkable that the Rangers and Knicks would go the way of the Giants and the Dodgers.
City Hall, with approval from the state, negotiated a tax abatement package for the Garden. Its centerpiece? Forgiving the Garden's property taxes for up to 10 years.
That was 1982, remember. It is now 2002. Even as the mayor proposes a 25 percent increase in the property tax rate, Madison Square Garden continues to get a full real estate tax exemption. The Finance Department's most recent "Annual Report on Tax Expenditures" shows that the value of the Garden's unpaid taxes was $8.8 million in the last fiscal year. 
Would the Garden leave if it had to pay property taxes? If it got a 25 percent increase -- on zero?
"Why should Madison Square Garden continue to get tax breaks forever?" asked Jonathan Bowles, research director of the Center for an Urban Future -- a nonpartisan research organization supported by foundations and trusts. "I think it is definitely time to rethink corporate subsidies and incentives." 
Mr. Bowles said that a city program to encourage smaller companies to expand -- often manufacturing firms -- was effective. But he was less certain about the many discretionary deals granted to larger companies to make sure they stayed in New York City; he estimated that from 1988 to 2000, the city negotiated about $2 billion in incentives to retain 80 companies and financial exchanges. The businesses took advantage of up to $1.4 billion of that.
WHETHER such incentives were necessary in every case or just an accepted way of doing business is a question that has been debated since the first deal was negotiated and probably always will be.
"Most of those companies were not going to go," said James A. Parrott, chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute, a labor-backed research group. "Ninety percent of those who asked for it got it. They just knew what buttons to push, what hoops they had to jump through." But what about now? In today's climate, exacerbated by the impact of Sept. 11, the city is vulnerable to losing companies, and the jobs that come with them. Dr. Parrott said that puts an even greater burden on the city to do a better job of defining its terms. "It may," he said, "be appropriate to at least put up a cautionary flag, say this has to be revisited."
The Bloomberg administration has been tightening up on discretionary programs, said Andrew M. Alper, president of the Economic Development Corporation. Because of the sluggish economy, the administration shelved a proposed deal with the New York Stock Exchange for a heavily subsidized new trading complex, for instance.
Mr. Alper said he was unaware of plans for a broad revision of the city's incentive programs. As for Madison Square Garden, he said he was unfamiliar with its deal, so could not comment.
Mr. Bowles, of the Center for an Urban Future, said he was not sure if the city has the legal authority to renegotiate existing agreements, but agreed with Dr. Parrott about the future: "I think we could get a lot smarter about this in years to come."

HEADLINE: Commuter Tax Draws Attention, but Bloomberg's Wish List to Albany Is Much Longer 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's ambitious plan to impose an income tax on people who work in the city but do not live there is hardly his only budget proposal requiring the approval of Gov. George E. Pataki and state lawmakers.
 The budget plan the mayor outlined last week included a wish list of things Albany could do to help the city out of its fiscal mess, ranging from a state absorption of the city's share of Medicaid costs, which would save City Hall $4 billion next year, to permitting OTB parlors to take bets on nighttime thoroughbred races, raising an estimated $15 million. 
 And Mayor Bloomberg -- who took pains to praise Governor Pataki, his fellow Republican, at every opportunity during the governor's successful re-election campaign -- signaled that he might now be willing to flex a bit more muscle to get what he wants from the state. 
While continuing to thank Mr. Pataki and the legislative leaders for their help earlier this year, Mr. Bloomberg also used his budget address on Thursday to highlight the many ways in which the state has hurt the city over the last four years.
The mayor showed reporters a chart of recent state actions that he said had cost the city more than a billion dollars a year: repealing the old commuter tax ($405 million); adding pension benefits ($363 million); eliminating compensation the state used to give the city for the loss of the old stock transfer tax ($114 million); and a number of other changes with effects totaling tens of millions of dollars.
"What these things have done is taken away $1.1, $1.5 billion," Mr. Bloomberg said. "So we're just getting back some of what we've lost."
The mayor's plan, written in hopes of closing a $6.4 billion budget deficit in the fiscal year that begins July 1, relies on more than $1.6 billion in revenue and savings that would require Albany's approval.
Mr. Bloomberg wants the state to give the city $275 million a year to help it pay for its new contract with the United Federation of Teachers, which raised teachers' salaries in exchange for longer work days. Governor Pataki helped pave the way for that agreement by giving the city more than $200 million in a one-time infusion of education aid. He went on to win the endorsement of the teachers' union. Now Mr. Bloomberg wants the state to make it an annual source of aid.
The mayor is also counting on Albany to take a combination of other actions that would either net or save the city $200 million next year, and he outlined a broad menu of things the state could choose from to help reach that target.
Some proposals, Mr. Bloomberg said, would cost the state nothing: reining in Medicaid costs; charging a 2.4 percent levy on hospital care to pay for health care for children who are not eligible for Medicaid; limiting the city's liability for lawsuits; allowing the city to refinance its debt; permitting the city to sell 900 new taxi medallions over the next three years; using money from state environmental bonds to pay for the city's recycling program; letting the city use more cameras to catch drivers going through red lights; and allowing OTB parlors to simulcast thoroughbred races at night.
Other proposals could be quite costly to the state. Unlike most states, New York passes along a quarter of its Medicaid costs to local governments, and New York City's share will reach $4 billion next year. The mayor proposed having the state bear that cost, saying, "We would not be in the situation we are today if we didn't have to pick up that cost."
But with the state facing its own budget deficit, many officials say they are hard pressed to understand how it could assume such costs.
Mr. Bloomberg is also counting on $200 million in transportation initiatives that would require either the state's approval or the approval of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is controlled by the state. Those include imposing tolls on East River bridges, a move Governor Pataki has opposed, and having the M.T.A. take over city-subsidized private bus routes in Queens.
Finally, there is the income tax proposal, which would be the biggest source of revenue by far that Mayor Bloomberg wants the state to approve. The mayor's plan counts on $1 billion in new revenue from his tax plan, which would reduce the income tax rate on city residents to offset a 25 percent property tax increase, while levying an identical income tax on commuters who work in the city and live elsewhere.
The official line in Albany, where lawmakers in 1999 repealed a commuter tax that was one-sixth the size of what Mr. Bloomberg has put forth, is that the new proposal is being studied. Privately, some Democrats in the Assembly have sounded open to it, while Republicans in the State Senate have vowed to kill it. Governor Pataki, who denounced the old commuter tax during his latest re-election campaign, has been noncommittal.
Mayor Bloomberg continued to press the issue yesterday. "New York City is the economic engine for the entire region and state, so keeping the city strong benefits everyone," he said in his weekly radio address.
Governor Pataki was still weighing his options.
"The governor is reviewing the mayor's proposals," said Lynn Rasic, a spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: White House Letter; 
Cold Shoulder or Warm Handshake?

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
First, President Bush refused to congratulate Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany on his re-election victory, then Mr. Bush ignored a personal letter from the chancellor. When he finally took a phone call from Mr. Schroder on Nov. 8, their conversation was businesslike and brief. 
 Now the question remains: Will Mr. Bush shake Mr. Schroder's hand at a major NATO summit meeting in Prague this week? 
 "I'm sure they will see each other at NATO," Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, said crisply and vaguely to reporters last week. 
But as of now, there is no scheduled one-on-one meeting between the leaders of the United States and Germany, the most important economic power in continental Europe and the center of gravity of the alliance.
Mr. Bush is still angry that Mr. Schroder campaigned this fall on a platform opposing a war in Iraq, and was further infuriated when a minister in Mr. Schroder's government was reported to have compared the president's tactics to those of Hitler. Administration officials readily acknowledge that the president's sense of betrayal ensures that his relationship with Mr. Schroder, which was not easy in the best of times, will never be the same again. 
"No question," a senior White House official said last week. "It will remain professional, but it's hard to imagine it being personal."
As if to underscore the change, the president's NATO calendar is filled with meetings with other European leaders. 
Mr. Bush has plans to sit down one-on-one at the summit meeting with President Jacques Chirac of France, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic and President Ahmet Necdet Sezer of Turkey. Then in Russia on Friday, he is to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin.
White House officials say that Mr. Bush is a mature leader who understands the importance of the American relationship with Germany, but they acknowledge that the trouble between the president and the chancellor shows how much Mr. Bush values personal loyalty -- and demands allegiance -- in his foreign policy. 
Their falling-out, diplomats say, also reflects the difficulty in establishing a bond between two sharply different men. One is an establishment-bred Republican raised in his famous father's shadow and the other is a Social Democrat who grew up in poverty without ever knowing his father, and who only recently visited his grave.
German diplomats tried last week to put the best possible face on a problem that has embarrassed and irritated them. They pointed out that not only did Mr. Bush take Mr. Schroder's call, but that Bernd Mutzelburg, Mr. Schroder's foreign policy adviser, met at the White House with Ms. Rice on Friday. 
They also emphasized that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld recently received Peter Struck, the German defense minister, at the Pentagon, and declared the relationship between the two nations "unpoisoned." 
In September, shortly after Germany's election, Mr. Rumsfeld had pointedly ignored Mr. Struck at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Warsaw, and afterward told colleagues that he did so to be loyal to his angry president.
"Everyone is now speaking with everyone else, and we're back in a normal working atmosphere," said Wolfgang Ischinger, the German ambassador to the United States, who last week played down the lack of a scheduled meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Schroder. "There will be numerous opportunities for dragging someone into a corner for discussion." 
Other German diplomats say they understand President Bush's anger, even as they call it "emotional." They also justify Mr. Schroder's successful campaign talk as the kind of hardball political practice the White House itself uses and admires. 
"I think the president perceived the position the chancellor took as a position against him personally," Karsten Voigt, the German foreign ministry's coordinator for American relations, said. At a critical moment when Mr. Bush was seeking support for this campaign against Iraq, Mr. Voigt said, "a leading ally was not only saying no, but was using the peace argument in an election campaign."
Last week, as the leaders of NATO's 19 governments prepared for an important meeting in Prague and their invitation to 7 former Communist countries to join the alliance, Ms. Rice continued to brush off suggestions that the lack of a scheduled meeting, or bilateral, between Mr. Bush and Mr. Schroder amounted to anything at all.
"There are a lot of very important countries with which we're not having bilaterals at the NATO summit," Ms. Rice said.
Even though Germany has refused to take part in a military strike on Iraq, Ms. Rice noted that the nation is set to take command of the peacekeeping force in Kabul, the Afghan capital, when Turkey relinquishes it next month. 
"Let's be realistic," she said. "The Germans have done a lot in Afghanistan, in the war on terrorism there, in counterterrorism. We appreciate that very much."
Or, as a senior German government official said this past weekend about the relationship between the president and the chancellor: "We're sure that rationality is going to prevail."

HEADLINE: An Urban Drought 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Last week's painful PowerPoint presentation by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, in which he offered up a brutal combination of proposed tax increases and service cuts, should have been televised nationally.
 "Coming soon" could have been the tagline, because the problems that have led to New York's worst fiscal crisis since the 1970's are circulating like a virus through cities all across America. 
 Mayor Bloomberg is making budget decisions in an environment plagued by a weak national economy and the debilitating aftereffects of the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. With little in the way of help on the horizon from the federal or state government, the mayor has come up with a plan that would raise taxes by more than $4 billion and cut services by close to $2 billion over the next year and a half. 
Those who think this is a problem peculiar to New York should think again. The National League of Cities, in its annual research report, released in August, said:
"Amid the current economic downturn, the fall of the stock market, and federal and state budget crises, fiscal conditions in America's cities are also declining. For the first time in a decade, the majority of city officials report that they are worse off financially than in the previous fiscal year."
Cities in virtually every section of the country are taking a big hit on revenues from sales and income taxes, and from tourist-related levies, such as restaurant and hotel taxes.
At the same time, in this era of terror, public safety spending is up. And other inescapable expenditures -- on health care, for example -- continue to rise.
The result for many cities is a cruel fiscal squeeze. Mayor Wellington Webb of Denver, in an interview last week, told me: "Fifty-four percent of all our revenue comes from the sales tax, and our sales tax collections for 2001 were the same as 2000. That was the first time in history we did not have an increase in sales tax collections. Now, on a month-to-month basis, we're finding that 2002 is running behind 2001."
He said he has imposed a hiring freeze and delayed the start of annual raises for city employees from Jan. 1 to July 1. The purchase of needed equipment for the Fire Department has been delayed and the city has cut its support for some cultural and recreation programs.
The outlook is worsening, not getting better. The League of Cities report said: "Expectations that these trends will continue into the future have local officials predicting a further worsening of conditions in 2003. Two-thirds of city officials believe that their city will be less able to address financial needs in fiscal year 2003."
Over the past several years there has been a growing understanding that the fiscal health of cities is a crucial component of the nation's overall economic health. Cities, often the vital hubs of vast metropolitan areas, are the engines of economic growth in the U.S.
The cities' problems can only be solved in the context of national policies. And it is essential that those policies include a more equitable approach to taxation and the development of aggressive, coordinated strategies to spur stronger economic growth and increased employment.
A national economic policy that consists almost solely of tax cuts for the very rich will lead only to further disaster.
Thomas Menino, the mayor of Boston and president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said: "The cities are struggling because we don't have the partnerships that we've had in the past with the state and federal governments. They've somehow abandoned our needs and that's unfortunate."
He spoke contemptuously of the tax-cut mania that is draining government coffers of the money needed to provide even basic services.
"I'm not a big raising-taxes kind of guy," he said. "But you have to get revenue from somewhere to pay your basic costs. . . . We don't run government with voodoo economics. We run it with real cash to fund real programs that help people."
Referring to cities in Massachusetts, he said, "We have a real financial crisis on our hands."
Optimism at the moment is in short supply. On the same day that Mayor Bloomberg was saying that New York could not "pray" its way out of its current crisis, Denver's Mayor Webb was saying, "I think it's going to be a rough few years."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: PREPARATIONS; 
U.S. TAKING STEPS TO LAY FOUNDATION FOR ACTION IN IRAQ

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is initiating a series of diplomatic and military steps that must be completed before the United States could go to war in Iraq, American and allied officials say.
 The tasks, some of which could take weeks or even months to carry out, include formalizing allies' roles in any offensive, discouraging neighboring countries like Turkey and Israel from taking their own action, and deciding whether to seek United Nations support for an attack. Failure to accomplish many of these objectives could delay or complicate the onset of war. 
 The administration is moving urgently to accomplish its objectives, even before the start of the weapons inspections ordered by the United Nations. One goal is to create a credible threat of force, which might pressure President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to comply with the new resolution of the United Nations Security Council. The other main reason for acting speedily is to be ready for combat in Iraq before the hot weather sets in there next year. 
There has already been some progress, officials said.
American officials have privately secured informal assurances of basing and overflight rights in several Central Asian and Persian Gulf countries, including Kuwait and Qatar, but those commitments need to be formalized. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is expected to consult with allies this week at the NATO summit meeting in Prague on how they might fill in for American forces now in Europe and the United States that would be moved to the gulf area.
The United States has stockpiled tanks and heavy equipment for more than 30,000 troops in several gulf states and on ships nearby. But additional heavy equipment for Marine or Army divisions would take three to four weeks to reach the Persian Gulf from ports like Beaumont, Tex., or Savannah, Ga. 
American diplomats have intensified talks with two important allies, Turkey and Israel, to persuade them to remain on the sidelines during an invasion. Quietly, often through informal channels, Washington has also broached discussions with Iran about preventing Iraq's Shiite majority from trying to seize control of Baghdad or form a separate state if Mr. Hussein falls.
If Mr. Hussein defies or obstructs weapons inspectors, the Bush administration will have to decide whether to seek approval from the Security Council for a military strike. Administration officials say President Bush would like Council support, provided it can be obtained quickly. Diplomacy to lay the groundwork for winning that swift passage is in the most preliminary stages.
Senior military officials say the portion of a total force of about 250,000 troops needed to begin the "rolling start" of an air, land and sea attack could be in place within 30 days of Mr. Bush's order.
"We're making preparations every day," Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz said on Friday. "I don't want to start saying exactly when we're at peak readiness, but it would be a terrible mistake for anyone to underestimate our ability to act if needed."
The timing of any offensive, however, hinges greatly on the outcome of the weapons inspections. "A lot depends on how things come out with the U.N. resolutions," said one senior military official.
But the administration has already begun laying the groundwork with dozens of countries for a possible attack. In a flurry of recent meetings and telephone conversations, some in Washington and some overseas, American officials have asked for assistance from allies and antagonists -- and received demands in exchange for their cooperation.
Turkey, which has several bases that would be critical for American troops and aircraft driving into northern Iraq, has received some of the most serious attention. In the past two weeks, Marc Grossman, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, and John E. McLaughlin, the deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, visited Ankara, while the new Turkish chief of staff, Gen. Hilmi Ozkok, met with officials in the Pentagon and State Department.
Turkey wants assurances from Washington that independence-minded Kurdish factions in northern Iraq will not attempt to form a separate state, a move that it fears could incite Kurdish separatists in its own country. Turkey has more than 3,000 troops in northern Iraq and could take steps to counter any efforts by Kurds there to seize territory. To ease Ankara's concerns, the Pentagon is preparing war plans to dispatch troops to protect the oil fields around Kirkuk in northern Iraq.
At Ankara's behest, Washington is also pushing European countries to accept Turkey into the European Union. Turkey, a major trading partner with Iraq, is also seeking compensation for economic losses that might result from war. Negotiations are under way for a multibillion-dollar aid package that would include forgiving Turkish debts, and military aid and grants, diplomats said.
"Should a crisis come because of Iraq's defiance, we will work to ensure that the safety net under Turkey's economy stays in place," W. Robert Pearson, the American ambassador to Turkey, said in a statement.
The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, has vowed to retaliate if Mr. Hussein launches missiles at Israel, a move that could swiftly undermine the support of moderate Arab states for an American invasion, perhaps igniting a broader war.
To allay Israel's concerns, Mr. Bush has approved a war plan that calls for American forces to seize land in western Iraq to destroy Scud missiles that could reach Israeli cities. Also, American diplomats are urging Israel to limit any responses to Iraqi aggression to purely defensive actions, such as firing Arrow antimissile weapons.
In turn, Israel, during a meeting between its national security adviser and senior Pentagon and State Department officials last Thursday, urged the United States to help resolve a water dispute with Lebanon and Syria, officials said.
The administration has quietly reached out to Iran, often through third parties, to enlist Tehran's support in discouraging Iraqi Shiites, who represent 60 percent of Iraq's population, from engaging in terrorism or forming a breakaway republic, officials said. Those channels include the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which represents American interests in Iran, various relief groups, the United Nations and a Tehran-based Iraqi Shiite opposition group, the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq.
In exchange for cooperation, Iran wants the United States to release billions of dollars in assets frozen in American financial institutions after American Embassy workers were taken hostage in 1979. It is also seeking pledges of assistance for Iraqi refugees who might pour into Iran if war breaks out.
In one sign that Tehran was trying to reach out to Washington, Javad Zarif, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, requested permission to visit Washington this week to meet with members of Congress. But the State Department, which must approve his travel plans beyond New York, would not allow him to stay overnight, and he canceled the trip.
"I think sooner or later we will have better relations with Iran," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said on Friday. "We stay in touch with people who might be on the same side of this as us, but I don't want to give the impression there is a great rapprochement about to take place with respect to Iran."
The diplomatic talks are closely linked to troop deployments.
American diplomats and senior military officials -- including Gen. Tommy R. Franks, commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf area -- have fanned out across Europe and Southwest Asia in recent weeks to discuss basing agreements for American troops and aircraft, and to determine which nations may contribute forces or equipment to an offensive to disarm Iraq.
General Franks said in a recent interview that the United States had not yet made formal requests for assistance. But several countries have given private assurances to provide troops, equipment, basing, supplies and other support for a war, officials said. Saudi Arabia, the most important gulf ally in the 1991 war, has given conflicting signals on whether it would allow the military to use a major air operations center outside Riyadh or its spacious air bases for another war against Iraq.
General Franks has set up an alternate command post in Qatar, and other countries, from Kuwait to Oman, could pick up the slack if the Saudis restrict their bases.
"We'll have the access we need wherever we need it to do our job," said Gen. Charles F. Wald, a former head of American air forces in the gulf who is the new deputy commander of United States forces in Europe.
The United States has already stockpiled hundreds of M1 Abrams tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers in the region, particularly in Kuwait. The military has also been stockpiling precision-guided munitions in the area and lining up local contractors to provide supplies for troops.
And while tens of thousands of American air, land and sea troops are now within striking distance of the gulf, an offensive, and any peacekeeping operation afterward, would require many thousands more.
Logistical equipment -- tugboats, forklifts and other equipment used to unload heavy gear -- is either en route or ready to be sent, as is portable bridging that the Army would use to ford rivers in Iraq. Heavy equipment for Marine or Army divisions would go via fast sea-lift ships that take about a month from Gulf of Mexico and East Coast ports. 
B-2 bombers, which would play a pivotal role in destroying Iraqi air defenses, would fly from bases in Britain and the British territory of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. The bombers' sensitive radar-evading skin requires the Air Force to erect portable hangars.
"There's an enormous amount already in theater, and I'd say within 30 days of an order, we'd have a substantial tank and mechanized force in place," said Gen. Barry McCaffrey, a retired Army commander from the gulf war in 1991.
A war with Iraq could require more than the 265,000 National Guard and Reserve troops summoned to active duty in the war in 1991, largely to protect valuable sites in the United States like airports, power plants and pipelines. 
Finally, any military campaign against Iraq would begin with a psychological operations campaign intended to turn Mr. Hussein's forces against him. Mr. Rumsfeld has approved the outlines of an ambitious plan that goes beyond traditional leaflet drops and broadcasts, a senior Defense Department official said. Of course, officials said, the buildup of American forces in the region is a big psychological operation in itself.

HEADLINE: Singapore's Recovery Falls Off Pace 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Nov. 18 

 BODY:
The Christmas lights have already been strung the length of Orchard Road, Singapore's fancy shopping boulevard, in preparation for a holiday season that promises little cheer for this export-dependent nation.
 Three months after emerging from its worst recession in nearly four decades, Singapore's economy has retreated again, the government said today. Though the country's gross domestic product was 3.9 percent higher in the third quarter than it was in the abysmal third quarter of 2001, output nonetheless fell sharply from the second quarter of 2002 -- a contraction of 10.1 percent at an annual rate. 
 With more people out of work now than at any time since the 1980's, officials here were hoping for an upturn in demand in the United States, the country's most important export market, to put the economy back on track in the second half of the year. Instead, the outlook has worsened, economists say, as the terror attacks in neighboring Indonesia, the probability of war in Iraq and the faltering recovery in America make themselves felt. 
"It's grim, very grim," said Desmond Supple, managing director at Barclays Capital in Singapore. "A recession in the first half of next year is looking increasingly likely." 
Singapore's biggest problem is the slowdown in America, which translates into sluggish demand for the electronic goods that are Singapore's lifeblood. Though Singapore has made considerable progress in promoting its pharmaceutical industry, electronics still account for 40 percent of manufacturing output and 60 percent of exports other than petroleum products.
The Singapore government reported today that nonpetroleum exports fell 3.1 percent in October from September. Leading the decline was a 6.2 percent drop in electronics exports, and in particular a 30 percent decrease in shipments of personal computers.
The government once expected the economy to grow at least 3 percent for the full year; now the forecast is for no more than 2.5 percent growth, a very slow pace by Singapore standards.
"We won't rule out the possibility of a double-dip recession, but at this point we will not assign it a very high probability," Friedrich Wu, director of the economics division at the Ministry of Trade and Industry, told a news conference today. 
Private economists agree that Singapore is likely to avoid a technical recession this year -- two consecutive quarters of economic contraction -- if only because of the usual seasonal spurt in the fourth quarter.
But with companies shipping less merchandise abroad, employees are spending less at home. Retail sales fell 0.8 percent in September from September a year earlier, extending a slump that prompted the Daimaru department-store chain of Japan to announce in June that it was pulling out of Singapore after 19 years.
Retailers are also being hurt by a falloff in travel and tourism, which accounts for an estimated 6 percent of Singapore's economy. Flat before the attack in Bali, tourist arrivals are now likely to fall further after the United States and other countries issued warnings to their citizens about the dangers of traveling in Southeast Asia.
To cut costs, companies with operations here are eliminating jobs, 37,000 of them so far this year out of a labor force of 2.1 million. Last week, the American semiconductor equipment maker Agilent Technologies announced that it would cut 200 more jobs at its factories in Singapore, adding to the 300 it cut last year. The chip maker Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing of Singapore said it would eliminate 300 jobs after losing $51 million in the third quarter.
With $80 billion in foreign-exchange reserves, Singapore's government is in a better position than most of its neighbors to cope with the strains. Many of its problems, like the dependency on electronics exports and the growing number of workers whose skills are only useful in one industry, are structural issues that it has already begun to tackle with the formation of a high-level economic review committee. 
The committee has been making recommendations to the government on the changes Singapore must make to compete with Malaysia, China and other nations for new investment, jobs and trade.
One of the committee's prescriptions, which the government adopted in May, is causing concern among economists. On the committee's advice, the government decided to cut income taxes and raise the sales tax to 5 percent from 3 percent. The move was expected to touch off a year-end rush of spending before it takes effect, but no rush has yet materialized, and economists say lower-income workers are sure to suffer from the tax changes.

HEADLINE: Law Firm Blames Economy For Lower Yearly Bonuses 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
A certain anxiety permeates the halls of big New York law firms at this time of year, as associates wonder, What will this year's bonus be?
 Cravath, Swaine & Moore, one of Wall Street's best-known firms, told its lawyers yesterday in an internal memorandum that year-end bonuses would be smaller than last year's and less than half those of 2000, the last boom year. 
 "Obviously the market has taken its toll," said Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University. But he added that "no one is going to shed tears" for junior lawyers. "These are 20-somethings whose bonuses are more than many people make in a year," he said. 
Cravath will pay $15,000 to first-year lawyers, most of whom began work in the fall of 2001, and second-year lawyers; lawyers in their third through fifth years will receive $20,000; and more senior lawyers will receive $25,000. The bonuses will be paid in December. 
Last year at many big New York firms, first-year lawyers received $20,000, and the most senior lawyers received as much as $50,000; two years ago, the most junior lawyers took home as much as $40,000.
Cravath's memorandum outlining the payments was blunt in explaining the reason for the decline. 
"The serious downturn in the national economy and in the environment for business transactions that began in 2001 has continued unabated throughout 2002," the memo reads. "The impact of that downturn has been felt in the legal community and by our clients."
Bonuses, like starting salaries (which are about $125,000 at the largest firms), are an important signal to law students graduating in the next year or two. The bigger the bonus, the more attractive the firm.
But the bigger the bonus, the less money for a law firm's partners, who must also worry about protecting their own compensation. Yesterday's memo at Cravath tried to dampen expectations for next year as well, observing that "near-term prospects for improved results are uncertain at best."
Professor Gillers said bonuses also suggested to clients that the firm had high-quality lawyers. "They want to say to those clients, 'Our lawyers are among the best-paid in the nation because they're among the best in the nation,' " he said.
Cravath's timing of the bonus announcement was risky, Professor Gillers said. While Cravath's partners may want to encourage other firms to keep their bonuses modest, the announcement may prompt other firms to go Cravath one better.
"This is like a poker game," he said. "Cravath is saying to Sullivan, 'This time around, we'll stay low.' " He was referring to Sullivan & Cromwell, a big law firm that began the bonus wars two years ago. 
When Sullivan led off with its bonus announcement in 2000, it later had to match higher bonuses by Cravath and others. If the same thing happens to Cravath this year, the firm's partners will have to decide how to react.
Benjamin F. Stapleton, a partner at Sullivan, said it was "just too soon to say" what his firm would do. "You can expect that we'll do something in the next few weeks," he said.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
For Now, No Offers For Stanton

BYLINE:  By TYLER KEPNER 

 BODY:
There is no surer thing in baseball than Mike Stanton appearing in the playoffs. Stanton has taken part in the last 11 postseasons. From Atlanta to Boston to Texas to the Yankees, Stanton has consistently been a component of winning teams.
 Stanton is a dependable left-handed reliever, the kind any team could use, and he is free to negotiate with any team while the Yankees stall. Contract offers, it would seem, should be buzzing through his fax machine. But as free agents enter the second week in which they can negotiate with all teams, Stanton is not aware of any offers. 
 "I think one of the reasons why the market has been kind of slow is, with the new basic agreement, everyone is trying to feel out where things are going to go," Stanton said yesterday in a telephone interview. "Some teams are trying to figure out how to go about this, and I think the Yankees are probably one of those teams. The teams that are getting the money aren't going to have the same kind of problem as teams that are paying out large amounts."
Stanton is the Yankees' union representative, one of the players who signed off on the deal with the owners in August. The Yankees' bloated payroll will be heavily taxed under the new agreement, which they have cited as a reason to be cautious this winter. But most teams that will benefit from the new competitive balance tax are not racing after free agents either.
Stanton said he was not discouraged by the early read on the system. He has heard such talk before.
"They've always used something," Stanton said, referring to the owners. "If it's not the basic agreement, it's the economy. It can be a number of different things. This year isn't that different than some of the previous years."
After working in 79 games last season, going 7-1 with a 3.00 earned run average and six saves, the 35-year-old Stanton said he was seeking a three- or four-year contract. His base salary last season, $2.5 million, would seem due to rise considerably.
The Boston Red Sox, who will use more than one pitcher to close games next season, are looking for relievers and would be interested in Stanton, a baseball official said. Stanton did not say which teams have contacted his agent, but he said several had shown interest. Though he does not have a formal offer, Stanton said, dollar figures have been discussed.
It would be hard to imagine the Yankees, who have no other left-handed setup men, letting Stanton go. Stanton, a native Texan who now spends his off-season in New Jersey, does not want to leave. 
"I played for several teams before the Yankees and actually played for a long time," said Stanton, who joined the Yankees in 1997. "But I do consider myself a Yankee and I think I've performed pretty well with them. Hopefully, we can get something done."
The Yankees' more pressing matters are the outfield and third base. General Manager Brian Cashman watched the free-agent outfielder Hideki Matsui in an exhibition series in Japan last weekend and has not ruled out meeting with him there.
As for third base, the Yankees could turn to a free agent like David Bell, but they seem hopeful of bringing back Robin Ventura, who would sign a one-year deal.
Bell's agent, Adam Katz, said he had "an introductory call" with Cashman last week and expects to hear from him again this week. "I expect their interest would be dependent on the Ventura situation," Katz said. "They haven't said that, but I'm assuming that's so."
The Yankees are attracted by Bell's defense and steady bat. Bell, who played for San Francisco in the World Series last month, would also be flexible enough to shift to second -- bumping Alfonso Soriano to the outfield -- if Drew Henson were to be ready at third later during Bell's contract. But the Yankees have not raised that possibility with Katz.

AGroup Links Fuel Economy To Religion

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 18 

 BODY:
A broad coalition of religious groups is preparing a grass-roots campaign linking fuel efficiency to morality, with some ads going so far as to ask: "What Would Jesus Drive?"
 Leaders of the effort are coming to Detroit on Wednesday to meet with William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company. They will also meet with executives at General Motors. 
 "We are under a commandment to be faithful stewards of God's creation," said Paul Gorman, executive director of the National Religious Partnership for the Environment, an umbrella organization of Christian and Jewish groups. "This is a crisis in God's creation at the hands of God's children." 
Leaders of many groups within the partnership have signed a letter to the Big Three's chief executives asking for improvements in fuel economy. They say they have a biblical mandate to be good stewards of God's creation and a responsibility to the poor who are especially harmed by pollution. And they decry supporting "autocratic, corrupt and violent" governments that produce oil.
"We write now to ask you in the automobile industry a more explicit question," the letter said, "what specific pledges -- in volume, timing and commitments to marketing -- will you make to produce automobiles, S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks with substantially greater fuel economy?" 
The letter was signed by an array of denominations, including American leaders of the Serbian Orthodox and Swedenborgian churches; Frank T. Griswold, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal church; David A. Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee; and the Rev. Mark S. Hanson, presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.
The letter says the groups will send study materials to 100,000 congregations of varying faiths and "train hundreds of clergy and lay people as spokespeople for energy conservation and fuel economy." Mr. Gorman said he hoped the meetings on Wednesday could begin a civil dialogue with Detroit. 
A spokesman for Ford, Jon Harmon, said: "We know that environmental issues are important to a lot of people for a lot of different reasons. Our first thing is that we want to make sure they have an understanding of the good things we have done," including Ford's pledge to improve the fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent by 2005.
The campaign could create complications for G.M.'s Chevrolet brand, which makes S.U.V.'s like the TrailBlazer and has been courting religious conservatives by sponsoring a Christian concert series. Mr. Gorman took a dim view of the relationship, saying "Chevrolet is encouraging people to buy automobiles which are poisoning God's creation."
One of the smaller groups in the religious partnership, the Evangelical Environmental Network, is behind the "What Would Jesus Drive?" campaign. But much of its effort will be done pulpit-to-pulpit by disseminating bumper stickers, pamphlets and magazines on the topic of Christianity and fuel economy. An ad in Christianity Today magazine will show a plaintive Jesus next to a clogged superhighway. TV spots will be shown in four states -- Indiana, Iowa, Missouri and North Carolina -- but distribution will be limited with an initial shoestring budget of $65,000. 
"When we look at the impact on human health, it's significant, and when we look at global warming, the projected impacts are going to be hardest on the poor," said the Rev. Jim Ball, the head of the evangelical group, who drives a Toyota Prius hybrid. "How can I love my neighbor as myself if I'm filling their lungs with pollution?"
Such views are not typical of religious conservative leaders. An article on the home page of the Christian Coalition questioned the wisdom of Mr. Ball's advertising campaign and echoed Detroit's claims that toughening long-stagnant fuel economy rules would lead to safety risks with only minimal environmental gains.
Some postings on Mr. Ball's Web site, www.whatwouldjesusdrive.org, were more pointed.
"Jesus would drive a Hummer" read one message, referring to G.M.'s gas-guzzling S.U.V., while another said, "This is a Web site with a liberal agenda and this has nothing to do with the Bible!" 
Rabbi David Saperstein, the Washington representative of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the central body of Reform Judaism, said, "The letter raises the issue of urging the automobile companies to engage with the ethics and human impact of what it is they are producing and to think about the values beyond the profit line."
Not all members of the National Religious Partnership have signed onto the effort. The Catholic Conference of Bishops, which last year drafted a lengthy statement asking for more action on global warming, is not taking an active role. 
"We share some of the goals and welcome the dialogue," said John Carr, the director of social development for the conference.
"We would be less likely to talk about what would Jesus drive," Mr. Carr said, "and more likely to talk about how to advance the common good of workers, consumers and the poor, who pay the greatest price for environmental degradation."

HEADLINE: Number of Women in Upper Ranks Rises aBit 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
A survey of executive and high-earning corporate women being published today shows percentage gains so small as to seem inconsequential, but for one thing: They were achieved during a recession, when many businesses were cutting back.
 That context suggests that economic hard times no longer wipe out senior women's advances, as downturns did in the past, said Sheila W. Wellington, president of Catalyst, which carries out the study every other year. 
 "There is an accepted belief, even among informed people, that in bad times, women are negatively affected," Ms. Wellington said. "They're late to the game and always considered marginal anyway, so why not lay them off?" 
In this recession, she said, that has not happened.
Catalyst found that women this year comprise 15.7 percent of the corporate officers of companies listed by Fortune magazine as America's 500 largest. That was up slightly from 12.5 percent in 2000. 
There is no universal definition of a corporate officer, but Catalyst looked for executives who have day-to-day responsibility for operations, who have the power to obligate their companies legally and who are considered insiders in Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Using those criteria, Catalyst identified 13,673 corporate officers in the Fortune 500, with 2,140 being women.
Catalyst also looked at pay and found that women make up 5.2 percent of the highest earners. In 2000, they were 4.1 percent. 
The survey reinforced some stereotypes and dispelled others. Women fared poorly in such sectors as oil, mining, engineering and heavy equipment -- except at the Williams Companies, an energy company where 28 percent of the officers are women.
Women generally did well, by contrast, in apparel and retailing, yet Tyson Foods and Levi Strauss & Company had no women officers.
The food production and home equipment and furnishings sectors finished near the bottom of Catalyst's industry rankings. 
The companies with the greatest percentages of female officers were Avon Products, with 44 percent, and the Gap, with 41 percent.
Before the 1990's, employment and income data generally showed that downturns hit women harder than men, Ms. Wellington said. But during the recession of 1991, there were the first indications that women were holding their own. 
The unemployment rate for women was lower than the rate for men, for example. And while annual income data showed women's pay losing ground to men's, weekly data suggested that the gender-based income gap was narrowing. 
"There was a lot of talk at the time of, 'Is this a trend, or is this a blip?' " Ms. Wellington recalled. She said the new study seemed to strengthen the case that executive women's gains were enduring. The survey made no attempt to examine women in lower-level jobs.
By limiting the survey to corporate officers, Catalyst is able to get data on all large publicly traded companies, even those that do not want to participate. Catalyst begins its research with written requests for information and phone calls. For the companies that fail to respond, Catalyst takes information from the filings of publicly traded companies at the S.E.C.
These documents provide extensive information on the identities and compensation of executives. But they do not disclose racial information, or explain which officer positions are line and which are staff positions.
The distinction is important. People in line positions generally have the kind of profit-and-loss responsibility that chief executives say is the single most important factor in an executive's rise to the top. Staff positions, in fields like human resources, finance and legal services, generally support the line jobs.
In the current survey, Catalyst found that men continued to dominate the line officer positions. Women held just 9.9 percent of these jobs, a slight increase from 7.9 percent in 2000. 
As for race, Catalyst was able to analyze information on just 429 of the 500 largest companies, because the other 71 did not provide it. The incomplete data showed that nonwhite women have an exceptionally hard time climbing the corporate ladder.
Nonwhite women accounted for only 1.6 percent of the corporate officers at participating companies, compared with 1.3 percent two years ago.
"Here, we see numbers that are virtually stagnant and minuscule," Ms. Wellington said. She said that Catalyst had studied the condition of nonwhite businesswomen in previous focus groups, and learned that they felt they had little common ground with the majority of white males at the top of their companies.

HEADLINE: Chairman of Computer Associates Resigns 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
The chairman of Computer Associates International, Charles B. Wang, said yesterday that he would step down immediately, closing out a 26-year career that started with fast growth but ended in the shadow of a criminal investigation into the company's accounting practices.
 Under Mr. Wang's leadership, Computer Associates became the world's fifth-largest software company, with almost 16,000 employees and $3 billion in annual sales. Mr. Wang will be remembered, analysts said, for aggressive accounting at Computer Associates and the $670 million payday he received in 1998, rather than for the company's programs, which, they said, are mediocre. 
 "His legacy is a company that's been built through acquisitions, with a lot of products that don't have much competition," said John McPeake, a software analyst at Prudential Securities. "They didn't have a pretense of saving the world through better technology -- it was, we are sort of out to consolidate the industry and gather economic value in the process."
Sanjay Kumar, the chief executive, will succeed Mr. Wang as chairman, Computer Associates said. Mr. Wang, 58, will take the honorary and unpaid title of chairman emeritus.
Dan Kaferle, a spokesman for Computer Associates, which is based in Islandia, N.Y., said that Mr. Wang would not receive a pension and that the board was not negotiating a retirement package for him. Mr. Kaferle said Mr. Wang's resignation was not related to the continuing investigations into the company's accounting, which were first disclosed in February.
The Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors in Brooklyn are examining whether Computer Associates inflated its reported profits from 1995 through 1998, when Mr. Wang stood to receive a grant of 12.15 million shares of stock if the price reached $53.33 a share. The S.E.C. and prosecutors are also looking into an accounting change that Computer Associates made in 2000 that effectively permitted the company to report some sales and profits twice.
Computer Associates has said its accounting is proper. The company has also dropped the double-counting accounting method it began in 2000 and returned to reporting its results only under standard accounting rules.
Mr. Wang is resigning because he "felt that the time was right," Mr. Kaferle said. "His successor was in place. He had worked on the transition for two years."
Mr. Wang was not available for comment. Mr. Kumar was traveling and could not be reached for comment.
In a statement, Mr. Wang said he planned to spend more time on "my many other interests and charitable endeavors." Two years ago, Mr. Wang and Mr. Kumar bought the New York Islanders hockey team. In addition, Mr. Wang is chairman of the Smile Train, a charity that provides surgery for children with cleft lips and palates.
Mr. Wang founded Computer Associates in 1976. Over the next two decades, he aggressively acquired competitors to build the company into the world's dominant maker of mainframe utility software, the programs that help big computers run more efficiently.
Clients of the software companies that Computer Associates had acquired often complained that Computer Associates cut technical support and service for their programs while rapidly raising its fees.
"The track record of acquisitions has certainly been controversial," said Kevin Buttigieg, a software analyst at Kaufman Brothers.
Still, investors liked the growth. The company's stock soared through the 1980's and most of the 1990's. From the initial public offering in 1981 to 1998, shares of Computer Associates rose more than 200-fold.
But in the four years since, the stock has fallen more than 75 percent, costing investors $25 billion. Over the same period, the company has paid Mr. Wang more than $700 million, making him one of the most highly paid executives in the world.
Graef Crystal, an expert on executive pay, said Mr. Wang's compensation had been excessive even by the standards of the 1990's. Mr. Wang ranks with Sanford I. Weill, L. Dennis Kozlowski, Michael D. Eisner and Lawrence J. Ellison as one of the most overpaid executives of the decade, Mr. Crystal said.
"He may come out nicely for the early part of his career," Mr. Crystal said, "but he leaves with an indelible stain on his record and his character for being one of the world's champion pay porkers."
In 2000, Computer Associates stirred more controversy when it changed its accounting in a way that essentially enabled it to count for a second time some sales and earnings it had already booked. At the time, Computer Associates said that it had adopted the new accounting method to go along with a change in the way it licensed software. But former and current employees of the company have said that Computer Associates adopted the new method to hide the fact that it had previously stretched accounting rules to inflate its sales.
Last year, Sam Wyly, a billionaire Texan who had sold his software company to Computer Associates in 2000, began a proxy fight to oust Mr. Wang and Mr. Kumar and take control of the board. Computer Associates had mismanaged its employees and angered its customers, Mr. Wyly contended.
After a battle that stretched through the summer of 2001, Computer Associates defeated Mr. Wyly's challenge, but the fight generated more bad publicity for Mr. Wang and Computer Associates. This spring, Mr. Wyly again tried to oust Mr. Wang but called off his fight in July after Computer Associates agreed to pay him $10 million. Computer Associates and Ranger Governance, Mr. Wyly's company, said the payment was made to compensate Mr. Wyly for the costs of his proxy fights. But some corporate governance experts said the money appeared to be little more than greenmail.
Charles M. Elson, director of the center for corporate governance at the University of Delaware, said Mr. Wang's heritage at Computer Associates "has got to be viewed as mixed." Mr. Wang "created a tremendous enterprise," Mr. Elson said. But "he was clearly controversial from a corporate governance standpoint."
Since Mr. Kumar, 40, became chief executive in 2000, Computer Associates has worked hard to improve its reputation with customers, Mr. Buttigieg said. But it faces a difficult battle, especially with spending on software weak and companies moving away from the mainframes that are the lifeblood of Computer Associates.
Mr. Wang "leaves the company at a difficult period," Mr. Buttigieg said. "He's leaving kind of on a down note."

Nets Find Success, But Not at the Gate

BYLINE:  By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
The Nets had the fifth-best record in the National Basketball Association through Saturday, but their attendance, while up 42 percent from the same point last season, was the third worst. They are one of the league's most exciting teams, so shouldn't they routinely sell out Continental Arena?
 The answer is no. Part of it is history. The franchise has a meager tradition of winning and a sparse history of packing whatever arena it plays in. The Nets' average attendance peaked at 17,525 in 1997-98 and fell to 13,761 last season. The fan base is not so large that it would respond with mass ticket purchases at the hint of a team turnaround. 
 "The Nets have been the stepchild to the Knicks for a long time," said Dean Bonham, a sports consultant, who once ran the Denver Nuggets. "Jason Kidd is helping them remove the stepchild tag, but it doesn't happen overnight."
Bonham says that teams like the Knicks, the Celtics, the Pistons and the Lakers are immune to long-term fan desertions, but a suddenly successful team like the Nets, without a legacy of championships, has a longer road to consistent sellouts.
There are other reasons why the Nets' average home attendance -- 14,010, better than that of Denver and Houston and within striking distance of Memphis and Orlando -- is not better: a steep ticket price increase; early-season attention paid to football; a rocky economy that has fewer people and corporations buying season tickets; and a location that does not encourage walk-up purchases.
"Anyone who didn't mention the economy in this environment would be wrong," said Lou Lamoriello, the chief executive of the Nets. "It's everywhere, not just here. All you have to do is look at Wall Street."
Still, nearly all season-ticket holders renewed from last season, and the Nets rank in the N.B.A.'s top five in increased season-ticket sales. But Lamoriello said, "We're not getting the attendance we should get."
One more factor may be keeping attendance down: the absence of the YES Network's Nets games on Cablevision systems, which serve 2.9 million subscribers. If established or potential fans cannot see the team's exhilarating brand of basketball, are they less inclined to go to games?
"In the past," Lamoriello said, "there was a philosophy that said if you televise all home games, it takes away from home attendance, and another that said if you don't televise, it takes away from attendance. I don't feel there's been a lack of exposure from the public being aware of the type of team we have."
Ratings for Nets game on YES are down this season, not surprising since they cannot be seen in Cablevision homes. Through 10 games, Nets games are being seen in an average of 36,500 households, down from 48,900 last season on Fox Sports New York and Metro.
YES is hoping to assuage fans by moving 5 to 10 games from its cable schedule to Channel 2. He would not name the suitors.
"It's the responsible thing to do," Leo J. Hindery Jr., the YES chairman, said. "I think it will happen. When the season started, and I didn't think Cablevision would do the right thing, we started exploring this."
YES is currently selling 20 Yankees games a year to Channel 2.
The situation for Nets fans in Cablevision areas who cannot switch to satellite service remains frustrating. Clifford Peterson of Harrington Park, N.J., said the combination of high trees and his house's exposure to the horizon made getting a dish impossible. Yet he has not decided to attend more than his usual four or five games a season.
"I'm agonizing about it," Peterson said. "It's early. I'm listening to the games on radio. Going to more games may turn on how exciting the Eastern Conference race is. But the price of tickets has gotten crazy. That would make me think longer before I buy tickets."

Frazier's Flaws on Display
Just because the Knicks started the season 2-8 doesn't mean that they deserve substandard TV analysis. But the MSG Network's Walt Frazier routinely states the obvious, overstates the routine, misuses words and exaggerates the action occurring before him. His flaws were on vivid display Saturday during Philadelphia's 93-92 victory over the Knicks.
*He said a timeout called by the Sixers' Keith Van Horn before a backcourt violation could be whistled was "profound thinking."
*He said the Sixers' Greg Buckner was "prostrate in the paint" when he sank a short jump hook. (Try shooting a jumper while lying facedown on the hardwood.)
*He excused Coach Don Chaney's decision not to start Latrell Sprewell as a way to energize the team off the bench, yet failed to criticize the move when the Knicks started lethargically from the opening tip-off.
*He failed to dissect a failed play with 12.5 seconds left, when the Knicks' Howard Eisley inbounded to Michael Doleac, who returned the ball back to Eisley, who missed a long-range shot. Sprewell and Allan Houston were on the floor, but all Frazier said was: "And Eisley was open. Maybe the play worked except it didn't go in."
In a memorable exchange, as the Knicks folded, Frazier told Marv Albert: "I'm often asked why is it that the Knicks are efficient until down the stretch. I'm just as baffled as anyone else. I don't have an answer for that." After being asked so many times, Frazier should have a multipart answer by now.
Albert sounded a mite stunned and said: "I think the answer is that teams that are not good lose games in the final minutes, whatever the sport. As Bill Parcells said, 'You are what you are.' "

HEADLINE: Justices Uphold Lincoln Center's Ban on Rallies 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
The plaza in the middle of Lincoln Center is not a public forum and the center's management can legally prohibit rallies, demonstrations and leafletting there, a federal appeals court ruled yesterday.
 The decision upheld a lower court ruling that found Lincoln Center was within its rights when it denied permission to Local 100 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union to hold a rally on the plaza. The union, which was seeking to represent food service workers at the Metropolitan Opera, challenged the denial on First Amendment grounds after a union employee was prevented from distributing leaflets on the plaza by Lincoln Center security personnel on May 22, 1999, and was threatened with arrest. 
 Upholding a decision by the Federal District Court in Manhattan, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled yesterday that Lincoln Center officials have maintained a consistent policy that "limits expression in the plaza to events having an artistic or performance-related component."
The plaza, with a large fountain as its centerpiece, is bounded by Avery Fisher Hall, the Metropolitan Opera House, the New York State Theater and Columbus Avenue. It is managed under a license agreement with the city by Lincoln Center Inc., a nonprofit corporation that is under the oversight of the Department of Parks and Recreation. Lincoln Center Inc. was formed in the 1950's by John D. Rockefeller 3rd and others to purchase the Lincoln Center land, which was condemned by the city in an urban renewal project.
The appellate court said the corporation's policy on demonstrations "is both viewpoint neutral and reasonable."
The union had argued that the Lincoln Center plaza, which on most days is crisscrossed by thousands of pedestrians and theater patrons, is "a public place that is functionally equivalent to a park, sidewalk or thoroughfare." As such, it argued, the restrictions on free speech, including labor organizing, can rarely be imposed.

HEADLINE: Albany to Offer Tax Amnesty 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WILSON 

 BODY:
New York State, which is expected to face a budget gap of at least $6 billion for the next fiscal year, hopes to recoup a small portion of the shortfall with its first tax amnesty program since 1997, officials announced yesterday. 
 The program is expected to coax $175 million out of delinquent taxpayers by offering a two-point drop in interest on back taxes and by waiving prosecution or sanctions. 
An amnesty program in 1997 raised $123 million, a state spokesman said. 
 "Our message to tax evaders is simple: 'Get caught up before you get caught,' " the state commissioner of taxation and finance, Arthur J. Roth, said yesterday at a news conference, quoting one of a few slogans for the program. Others include "The second chance you've been waiting for," and "Do the right thing, wipe the slate clean." 
About one million New Yorkers will be sent mailings detailing what they owe and how much they can save by paying now. The amnesty deadline is Jan. 31. The program is outlined on a state Web site, www.nystaxamnesty.com, where taxpayers can settle balances with an electronic transfer or with a credit card. Information is also available by telephone at (888) 552-3453.
On April 1, after the deadline, interest rates on outstanding liabilities will rise two percentage points over the pre-amnesty levels, or four points for those participating in the program, Mr. Roth said. 
The program applies to most state taxes, including personal income and withholding taxes, corporation and franchise taxes, and sales and use taxes. Some local taxes also apply, including the New York City personal income tax and various sales taxes.

HEADLINE: In the Market for a Nursery School 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a native New Yorker and a childhood member of the 92nd Street Y in the late 50's and early 60's, I was dismayed by your Nov. 15 news article "No Talking Out of Preschool; Favoritism in Nursery School Entrance? No Comment."
 What has become of the 92nd Street Y, an institution steeped in the equality of all? 
 Membership many could afford, concert tickets at reasonable prices and an assurance of equal access the minute you walked through the doors: this was not a place for the super-rich; this was a place where the only hubris was of artistic or political opinion. Money didn't talk at the Y. 
What has become of parents that they want to isolate their children from the ethnic and economic diversity that is New York? And finally, what will become of these poor kids denied a full life by their parents' affluence?

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 
Ad Spending Rises In First 3 Quarters

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
Bouncing back somewhat from the depressed advertising market of 2001, advertising spending in major media rose 2.2 percent for the first three quarters of 2002 compared with figures in the period a year earlier, according to a report yesterday from CMR in New York, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres that tracks ad spending.
 The increase, to $84.4 billion from $82.6 billion, was attributed to factors like the unexpectedly strong advance in sales of commercial time for the 2002-03 television season; election-year political ads; and a strong gain for ad spending in the third quarter, which rose 9.6 percent from the period last year. 
 The 2.2 percent increase contrasts with the results for the first six months of 2002, when CMR reported that ad spending fell 0.2 percent from the period in 2001. The increase for the first three quarters led CMR to reiterate an earlier forecast that total ad spending for 2002 would increase 2.5 percent from last year.
The medium with the largest percentage increase in ad spending for the first nine months was Spanish-language network television, up 25.5 percent, followed by local spot television, up 14.7 percent, and network radio, up 14.3 percent. The medium with the largest percentage decrease in ad spending for the first three quarters was the Internet, down 18.2 percent, followed by business-to-business magazines, down 17.4 percent, and nationally syndicated television programs, down 11.8 percent.

PERSON: Cho Choong Hoon 

HEADLINE: Cho Choong Hoon, 82, Builder Of a Korean Business Empire 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 18 

 BODY:
Cho Choong Hoon, who rose to become a prototypical leader of a Korean chaebol, or conglomerate, that included Korean Air Lines, the country's flagship airline, died on Sunday at a hospital here. He was 82.
 Starting out in the port city of Inchon with a single truck in 1945, the year of the Japanese surrender that ended World War II and Japanese rule over the Korean peninsula, Mr. Cho built his empire in the style of a generation of businessmen responsible for Korea's economic rise. 
 Mr. Cho's conglomerate, the Hanjin Group, ranks eighth among Korean conglomerates, with assets valued at more than $20 billion. Besides Korean Air, the 21 companies in the group include Hanjin Shipping, Hanjin Transportation, Hanjin Heavy Industries and Meritz Securities.
Mr. Cho, like many other Korean business leaders, owed much of his initial success to United States military contracts, first during the Korean War and then during the Vietnam War. His trucking company carried ammunition and other supplies for American forces on the ground during the Korean War. During the Vietnam War, his shipping company transported military supplies while his construction operation developed ports for the Navy and military contract vessels.
For most of his career, Mr. Cho had the title of group chairman. He differed from the leaders of other chaebols in that he focused on one major industrial segment, transportation, rather than investing in a wide range of enterprises and industries.
Like other chaebol leaders after the Korean War, Mr. Cho formed a close relationship with Park Chung Hee, the general who helped foster Korea's rapid growth after seizing power in 1961.
Mr. Park, who ruled for 18 years until his assassination in 1979, divided industrial areas among corporate leaders whom he trusted and viewed as capable of competing internationally, in keeping with his vision of Korea as an industrial power. On the basis of Mr. Cho's achievements in transportation, Mr. Park selected Mr. Cho as the businessman to privatize the government-owned airline.
While merchant ships and cargo containers bearing the Hanjin name traverse the globe, Mr. Cho was proudest of his success in building Korean Air Lines into a major international carrier with a unique distinction: it is the only international airline that has its own manufacturing division. Korean Air Lines makes aircraft parts for Boeing and Airbus and assembles planes for the Korean air force.
As chairman of Korean Air, Mr. Cho's greatest failures began in 1983, when a Soviet MIG fighter shot down a Boeing 747 with 269 people aboard after it strayed into Soviet air space. More than 800 people died in crashes of Korean Air planes between 1983 and 1999.
President Kim Dae Jung publicly blamed the "management style" of the group for the crashes, forcing Mr. Cho to accept responsibility and resign as Korean Air chairman. Mr. Kim's anger also reflected concern over the finances of the Hanjin group, which had accumulated a debt-equity ratio of 10 to 1 before the Korean economic crisis of 1997, during which Hanjin Engineering and Construction was merged with Hanjin Heavy Industries.
Mr. Cho remained group chairman but installed his son, Cho Yang Ho, as chairman of the airline. In the traditional style of the leaders of Korean chaebols, Mr. Cho divided power over his companies among his four sons as his health deteriorated in recent years.
Cho Yang Ho is expected to become chairman of the group while retaining control over Korean Air. The other sons all serve as vice chairmen of other group companies, at which they are in line to succeed their father as chairman -- Cho Nam Ho at Hanjin Heavy Industries, Cho Soo Ho at Hanjin Shipping and Cho Jung Ho at Meritz Securities. Mr. Cho is also survived by his wife, Kim Jung Il, and a daughter, Cho Hyun Sook.

HEADLINE: Who's Afraid of theDeficit? Cassandras Are Out of Style 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18 

 BODY:
These are gloomy times for those who plead for fiscal discipline in the federal government, and not simply because the budget has swung from surplus to deficit in the last year.
 Even the most passionate champions of a balanced budget see little danger in this year's deficit of $159 billion and similar shortfalls for the next two or three years. 
 The real problems, they say, are just over the horizon: soaring costs for Social Security, Medicare and other benefit programs as the oldest baby boomers start reaching retirement age around 2010.
"It is a slowly growing cancer that is eating away at us," said Lawrence J. Kotlikoff, a professor of economics at Boston University who has analyzed the issue intensively. "We are not detecting it because it is small right now. But it is entering the bloodstream and it will kill us." 
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, asserts that the sum of commitments made to Americans today, from Social Security and Medicare to farm subsidies, amounts to more than $10 trillion in "contingent liabilities" for the government. 
The Congressional Budget Office has repeatedly warned that if nothing is changed, the government will spend as much on Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare by 2030 as it does for its entire budget today.
But the problems begin much sooner. The oldest baby boomers will begin retiring eight years from now, and the number of retirees is expected to swell rapidly after that.
Though leaders in both parties acknowledge the looming demands, neither Democrats nor Republicans have much appetite for reducing deficits anytime soon.
President Bush, fortified by Republican majorities in both the House and Senate, is pushing for a Reagan-like mixture of more tax cuts to stimulate the economy and more spending on the military and on selected domestic programs, like prescription drugs for the elderly.
Congressional Democrats, though quick to denounce Republicans as irresponsible tax cutters and spendthrifts, are themselves deeply divided about taxes and pushing for their own list of spending increases.
"The consensus that had developed in support of fiscal discipline has broken down," said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan research group in Arlington, Va. "Once you break that discipline, it is hard to get back again."
It is hard to imagine a less fashionable issue in Washington these days than balancing the budget.
President Bush, harking back to the supply-side economic theories that his father once denounced as "voodoo economics," said last week that last year's $1.35 trillion tax-cut package had made the deficit smaller rather than larger. "Make no mistake about it, the tax relief package that we passed -- that should be permanent, by the way -- has helped the economy, and that the deficit would have been bigger without the tax-relief package," Mr. Bush said.
Many Congressional Democrats have denounced the tax cuts as fiscally irresponsible, but few have actually called for repealing them. 
A few Democrats even argue that fiscal discipline is a false goal.
Robert B. Reich, secretary of labor under President Bill Clinton, ridicules the "neo-Hooverian orthodoxy" that prevailed under his former boss and proposes stimulating the economy by allowing every person to pay no taxes on the first $15,000 in income.
Given the continued weakness of the economy, even usually hawkish budget analysts say it would be a mistake to clamp down on spending or raise taxes right now.
For one thing, even this year's deficit of $159 billion is small in relation to the overall economy. At about 1.5 percent of total economic output, that figure is proportionately a much narrower deficit than those run up under President Ronald Reagan in the early 1980's. Those deficits peaked at more than 6 percent in 1983. European countries are striving to keep deficits below 3 percent of gross domestic product, and Germany missed even that target.
"In the short term, there is very little risk at all," said Carol Cox Wait, president of the Committee for a Responsible Budget, who has battled for fiscal toughness for more than 20 years. "To ignore those facts is to make a fool out of yourself."
But budget analysts from across the political spectrum say the longer-term risks are substantial.
President Bush is currently campaigning to make permanent last year's $1.35 trillion in tax cuts, most of which are scheduled to expire around 2010. If they continue after that date, the Treasury will lose more than $200 billion in annual tax receipts, according to Congressional analysts, precisely at the time when Social Security and Medicare costs are expected to surge.
Meanwhile, both Republicans and Democrats want to enact a major new program to pay for prescription drugs for the elderly. The Republican plan advocated last summer would cost about $380 billion over 10 years, while the Democratic alternative would cost nearly $800 billion.
Current forecasts by both the Congressional Budget Office and the Bush administration assume that discretionary spending -- outlays separate from mandated entitlement programs and interest payments -- will increase at the expected rate of inflation, 2 percent a year.
But in the last four years, discretionary spending has grown about 8 percent a year. The Concord Coalition calculates that if that continues, and if the government extends all the tax cuts now scheduled to expire, the government will accumulate a 10-year deficit of $1.8 trillion by 2012.
All those costs would kick in before the anticipated rise in retirement and health care costs associated with the aging of the population.
"We are committing ourselves to a much more expensive government than what we are willing to pay for," Ms. Wait said. "We need a serious conversation with ourselves about what we are ready to pay for."
But that view is hardly shared by all. A fierce debate is under way about the effects of deficits.
Disciples of Robert E. Rubin, President Clinton's Treasury secretary, argue that lower government borrowing leads to lower interest rates because the government no longer crowds out private borrowers.
By that analysis, budget-tightening tax increases under President George Bush in 1990 and under President Clinton in 1993 helped set the stage for the extraordinary economic boom of the late 1990's.
President Bush and other Republicans adamantly disagree. "That's Rubinomics, and we think it's completely wrong," said R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.
Under that view, economic growth is the prerequisite for a balanced budget, not the other way around.
Senator Don Nickles, the Oklahoma Republican who is the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, says leaders need to stimulate the economy. He has suggested moves like accelerating last year's tax cuts.
"We had a 7 percent drop in revenues, and outlays grew by 11 percent," he said in an interview on Friday. "There are reasons why that happened -- the recession, 9/11 and the war against terrorism. But to turn it around, you have to get the economy growing again."
Economists who support the administration argue that there is no evidence that higher government deficits lead to higher interest rates.
"Fear of deficits of the magnitude being projected for the United States is largely overblown," said Stephen J. Entin, president of the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation, a conservative economic research group in Washington.
Many conservative economists also argue that the only way to reduce government spending is to cut taxes and thereby starve the government of revenue.
"If we don't cut taxes, we will most assuredly increase spending," said John Cogan, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institute at Stanford University. "That is not a partisan statement. That is just a statement of the way things are."
Mr. Cogan noted that the government's discretionary spending had soared when the government had found itself awash in unexpected revenue from the economic boom.
Even though Congress adopted seemingly tough restrictions to freeze spending on discretionary programs, Mr. Cogan said, spending grew by $190 billion from 1998 through 2001.
If spending continues to grow at the pace of the last four years, about 8 percent annually, budget analysts warn, deficits will persist through the end of the decade.
Mr. Greenspan urged lawmakers last week to establish a long-term fiscal structure that would include limits and automatic "sunset" provisions, to end programs after a set number of years, for many kinds of spending programs.
"It is essential to restore some of the positions we had previously," Mr. Greenspan told the Joint Economic Committee last Wednesday. "Unless we know where we are going, we will have no sense of the implications of those actions over the long term."
When asked by lawmakers what investors believed the government's long-term fiscal framework might be, Mr. Greenspan responded, "That there isn't one."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: HELP FOR KABUL; 
O'Neill, in Afghanistan, Promises to Push $2.3 Billion Aid Bill

BYLINE:  By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: DURRANI, Afghanistan, Nov. 18 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill confirmed the Bush administration's support for reconstruction in Afghanistan during a visit here today, promising that the administration will do everything possible to see that a $2.3 billion aid bill pending in Congress will go through.
 Mr. O'Neill visited development projects, including one in this village, and met with President Hamid Karzai and Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani Ahmedzai. He told them that the bill still had to go before appropriations committees but assured them it had President Bush's support. 
 "Listen, the president really wants this done, and we will get it done," he told Mr. Karzai, according to an American official who was at the meeting.
Mr. O'Neill made the one-day visit to Afghanistan as part of a tour of the region ahead of visits to Pakistan and India. 
Coming just a month after a visit by Tommy G. Thompson, secretary of health and human services, Mr. O'Neill's visit helped to highlight the United States' shift in emphasis in Afghanistan from military and emergency aid operations to reconstruction and development of the economy.
"There is absolutely no change in the importance and the priority accorded to Afghanistan," Mr. O'Neill said today. "The president has made a commitment that we would come here and we would get rid of the Taliban, and that we would help the Afghan people to build a civil and just society, and there is no change in that." 
He added that he wanted to see money going directly to the Afghan government, rather than to international bodies and private groups, to enhance the government's stature and credibility with its people. "We are interested in seeing flows of money into this government because President Karzai and this government are so important to the future of Afghanistan," he said.
During his visit today, Mr. O'Neill went to two small factories run by returning refugees, a road project and the Central Bank, where officials are halfway through an ambitious plan to introduce a new currency in order to stabilize the economy. 
In the early morning, he stepped out of a Chinook helicopter and stood squinting down a rough gravel road at this village, 27 miles south of Kabul. A United States-finance construction project started here just a week ago on the mammoth task of fixing Afghanistan's roads.
Mr. Karzai has said fixing the roads is a priority, a project that will be highly visible to all Afghans and will provide employment and expand trade and commerce. But it will take some $260 million and three to five years to repair and rebuild 600 miles of roads that have generally not had any maintenance work since they were built 35 years ago. 
The United States, Japan and Saudi Arabia have each pledged $50 million toward the project, but only the United States has made any money available, enabling work to start on a first 30-mile section south of Kabul.

HEADLINE: Questions Arise On Accounting At UnitedWay 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Some United Way organizations, trying to appear more successful and more efficient with their donors' money, are counting contributions in ways that make the numbers look more robust -- and expenses look smaller.
 In a number of cases, including two of the largest United Ways -- those in Washington and Chicago -- different organizations counted some of the same contributions, thus inflating not only their own numbers but the system's totals, according to United Way executives. 
 Moreover, the United Way of America's reporting guidelines direct its 1,400 members to count as their own contributions money that was actually handled by or raised for competing organizations in shared campaigns, the executives said. The guidelines also tell members to count as contributions the value of volunteers' time, a practice many other charities frown on, although it is permissible in limited circumstances.
And while local United Ways publicly report the percentage of their total contributions used for administrative purposes, they do not tell donors that different amounts are applied from different types of contributions to cover costs, a review of their practices shows. 
United Way of America's president said that while some of the practices conformed with generally accepted accounting principles, they might no longer pass muster after recent corporate scandals demonstrated that even approved practices can be used deceptively.
"What happened at Enron and WorldCom has raised the bar for both for-profit and not-for-profit businesses," said Brian A. Gallagher, president of the United Way of America. "We have to respond."
United Way is by far the largest organization raising money in American workplaces. It channels money to thousands of small local charities that would otherwise struggle to find donors and increasingly creates its own programs to address community needs.
No one disputes its good intent. But its accounting practices raise questions for potential donors who want to know precisely how much of their contributions go to people in need rather than the organization helping them. In effect, these practices, by artificially inflating reported contributions, make it seem as if expenses consume a smaller portion of donor dollars. That makes United Way look better against competing charities at a time when more and more donors are relying on services that rate charities.
"Because they miscount the totals, they start off with a faulty number," said Rick Cohen, president of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a watchdog group in Washington. "That's their fundamental flaw."
Each time a case of double counting has arisen, United Way of America executives have said it is limited to a particular United Way. They defend the other practices that have been called into question.
But executives at some local United Ways are less certain. After reading in newspapers about questionable accounting and financial management at the United Way of the National Capital Area in Washington last January, "I felt chilled because I had seen some similar things in other United Ways," said Brian T. Hassett, who served as president of the United Way in Chicago until recently.
Les White, a former county manager in San Jose, Calif., said he saw some of the same things when he was brought in to resuscitate the United Way Silicon Valley. "Some of what I read about in Washington, D.C., sounded so familiar," he said. "It's myopic to insist that these problems are only in one place."
The practices have developed as the United Way has struggled to recover from recent scandals. Contributions began falling in 1992 when William V. Aramony, the United Way's national leader, was accused of fraud, embezzlement and other charges, and a string of local scandals like the one in Washington this year have not helped. Contributions are now lower, after adjusting for inflation, than they were a decade ago, even as charitable giving has doubled over all.
One of the most serious accounting issues the organization faces is known as double counting, which occurs when each of two or more United Ways counts the same contribution as its own.
The problem has come to light this year in the Chicago area and in Washington. Here's how it happens. The United Way of Suburban Chicago, an umbrella organization for 52 United Way organizations in the Chicago area, planned to count as its own some $350,000 raised at Baxter International -- the same money counted by an unaffiliated United Way, that of Lake County.
Each organization insists that it managed the campaign and wants to include the money in its total, as each has in the past. The United Way of America is now conducting a review.
In 2000, The Arizona Star reported that the United Way of Tucson counted almost $1 million raised in California for charities there. And the United Way of the National Capital Area counted as its own the $1.2 million raised from Giant Food's employees, who assigned some of that money to the United Way of Baltimore.
Each time an instance of double counting surfaced, the United Way of America insisted that the practice was exclusive to the United Way in question. But in 1999, Mr. Gallagher headed a task force to address double counting, which suggests that the United Way had concerns about how widespread the practice might be.
The task force prescribed how such contributions were to be booked. But its explanation was confusing -- and it undercut its own recommendations. "The task force realized early on that it would be impossible to create standards that all United Ways 'must' adhere to, and demanding strict adherence is arguably not part of our culture right now," the task force report said.
When the report was released, fewer than 13 percent of United Ways, or roughly 178 of the 1,400 organizations, had written guidelines for reporting and spending, and as the task force recognized, the national organization has little ability to compel compliance.
"There's so much variance among United Ways in things like accounting, finances and systems," said Arnold Henning, the interim president of the United Way in Chicago. "The independence to vary from city to city is our strength when it comes to services because it means we know the needs of our communities. But it's also our weakness because people don't understand that the practices of one United Way are not the practices of all United Ways."
Double counting is not the only way that reported contributions are overstated. An increasing number of companies like Sears, Hewlett-Packard and Verizon are using newer organizations like the JK Group to administer employee-giving campaigns and allowing other fund-raising groups like the Black United Fund or the Public Interest Fund of Illinois to take part.
Yet United Ways count this money as their contributions. Indeed, the United Way of America instructs members to count the entire amount raised in those campaigns, not just the amount of money designated for United Way. 
At least $2.4 million counted as contributions by the United Way in Washington was handled by its competitors, officials said, and $7.5 million was counted in New York City, according to its annual report.
United Way says this is legitimate because even when it does not actually collect or receive the contributions, its marketing and publicity efforts are responsible for them. "The question is, Did the United Way incur a cost during the campaign?" Mr. Gallagher said. "If it did, then it's reasonable to include all the revenues raised in the campaign and calculate operating budgets and expenses against them."
But others disagree. "The guidelines say we can count this money, but frankly, it made me uncomfortable," Mr. Hassett said.
Nan Langen Steketee, consultant and co-founder of the National Alliance for Choice in Giving, noted that there are many other organizations managing fund-raising for governments and businesses. "They do not count the money raised for other charities in their yearly totals," she said.
Mr. Hassett and others argue that counting such money creates "phantom revenues," and expenses cannot be deducted from money that is not received. "If the money doesn't flow into your coffers, you can't deduct from it," said Anthony DiCristofaro, a longtime United Way marketing executive.
The solution, Mr. DiCristofaro and other United Way executives say, is simple: Charge companies and governments a fee for United Way services to help offset the loss of phantom revenue.
There are other forms of phantom revenues. The United Way of America tells members to place a value on donated goods and include the amount in their tally of donations. This is acceptable accounting practiced by some other charities, but United Way critics question how the values are calculated.
More controversial is placing a value on volunteers' time and including it in contribution totals. The United Way directs its members to value their volunteer time at $14.83 an hour, although many local organizations refuse to go that far. For the most recent campaign, the United Way valued in-kind donations, including volunteer time, at $267 million.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board, the rule-making body for the accounting business, allows organizations to place a value on contributed time but with strict limits: Volunteers must either create or significantly enhance a nonfinancial asset or provide special skills that would otherwise have to be purchased. The Internal Revenue Service does not allow valuation of volunteer time at all for tax reporting purposes.
"With the United Ways, it is often quite a reach for them to try and use this volunteer time in their accounting," said Trent Stamp, executive director of Charity Navigator, an online charity rating service. "I get the feeling they might be putting a dollar value on people licking envelopes, which is not what was intended."
The United Way of America reports that on average administrative costs amount to 12.7 percent of total contributions. But because total contributions are inflated by the inclusion of noncash gifts like free computers or the gift of children's coats, expenses are understated.
Mr. Gallagher disagreed that contributions were inflated, saying the United Way's practices conform to accepted accounting principles.
Further, donors making "unrestricted gifts" -- those that allow the United Way discretion in spending their donations -- often pay a higher percentage of their contributions. The Washington United Way boasted that its administrative costs ate up only a dime of every dollar donated, but this masks the fact that 62 cents of every unrestricted dollar was going to cover overhead.
That was an extreme example but indicative of an overall problem, which also surfaced in Tucson two years ago. "The sad thing is that the donors that are the most valuable to the United Way are the ones who are paying most," Mr. Hassett said.
The annual report of the United Way of New York City, perhaps the most candid of the United Ways about accounting, stated that it raised $132.4 million in total contributions last year. Almost 14 percent, or $18.3 million, was used to cover administrative expenses, it said.
But only $91 million of that total was in cash, it said, meaning that on average almost 18 cents of every actual dollar it handled was eaten up by expenses.
The organization deducted an average of 6.9 cents of every dollar for administrative purposes, it said, from $14 million collected from donors who earmarked their gifts for specific charities, a program the United Way calls Donor's Choice. 
That means on average roughly 20 cents of every unrestricted dollar went to cover expenses, which falls within the Better Business Bureau's guidelines for expenses but is higher than the annual report would lead a donor to believe.
Lawrence Mandell, executive vice president of the New York United Way, defended the practice of charging different donors different amounts, stressing that donors who make unrestricted gifts to the United Way receive services that other donors do not.
"We have a strict volunteer review process that vets agencies on their behalf, we give those agencies management assistance, help develop their boards, and we find really highly competent agencies that donors might not otherwise know about," he said. "Donors Choice donors don't get any of that."
That said, Mr. Mandell acknowledged the need to give donors a clearer picture of how costs are allocated to them.
Recently, the United Way's National Professional Council approved standards being championed by Mr. Gallagher that would require United Ways to provide fuller disclosure to the national organization. Not complying would mean a loss of membership.
But the new standards do not address much of the reporting that makes contributions seem larger and expenses smaller. The council, for instance, left open whether or not to include donations raised by a third party.
The new standards face a vote at the United Way's annual meeting in April, but Mr. Gallagher said the council's endorsement gave him the power to carry them out earlier. "I would be surprised and disappointed if they don't pass," he said.
Some United Way executives, however, worry that their colleagues will see the new standards, with the scrutiny from a committee that includes outside experts on ethics and finance, as another effort by the national organization to increase its power.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 23, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Tuesday about the United Way system's accounting techniques referred incorrectly to the calculation of contributions used to cover the charity's administrative costs. The national umbrella body, United Way of America, does not include the value of donations in kind, like computers and volunteer time.

HEADLINE: College Debt Grows Along With Tuition 

BYLINE:  By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
College gets more expensive each year, and loans continue to make up the bulk of financial aid packages. 
 In the 80's and early 90's, about half of financial aid was in the form of grants. Last year, grants made up 39 percent of aid, up slightly from a low of 37 percent in the '99-'00 school year. 
 The average amount a student with loans borrows per year reached $4,200 last year, compared with $1,888 a decade ago, after adjusting for inflation. So at graduation, the average student with loans will owe about $17,000. KATHLEEN O'BRIEN

HEADLINE: Nuns Bring Hope to a Destitute Town in Mississippi 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: JONESTOWN, Miss. 

 BODY:
With the harvest nearly over, bits of cotton residue scatter over the roads. The smell of frying chicken drenches Main Street. Men without jobs dig under the hoods of old Pontiacs, trying to make them run again. The scene here could be from any of the mostly black, mostly destitute towns at the core of the Mississippi Delta.
 Except for the gray-haired woman in a sweatshirt and jeans, coaching teenage boys in a game of flag football. The woman, Kay Burton, is white, robust as the Idaho farmers she grew up among, and a Roman Catholic nun. 
 Sister Kay, 65, a member of the Holy Name order, is one of four nuns from faraway states who live and work in Jonestown, a community of 44 whites and 1,660 blacks 50 miles south of Memphis. 
In the 1980's, a half dozen orders of Catholic nuns looked around the country to see where they could be most helpful, and they began sending members into the Delta, with the support of the Diocese of Jackson, Miss. Since then, several hundred nuns have settled in communities like Tutwiler, Tunica, Marks, Rosedale and Jonestown -- places that whites had deserted with the desegregation of schools. 
With little fanfare and no government help to speak of, these sisters help reinforce the town's crowded and underfinanced public schools. They are also nurses, doctors, counselors and community organizers. They build medical clinics, nonsectarian preschools for the youngest children and houses with Habitat for Humanity volunteers. 
They provide the towns' only refuges for many children to do homework or make decorations for Halloween. They organize programs for teenage girls as alternatives to becoming pregnant. 
Using church and private donations -- nothing from government agencies -- they have opened a new brick Community Education Center in Tutwiler with a big gymnasium. In Jonestown this year, they opened a Montessori school for children ages 2 to 6. 
People say the sisters keep their towns afloat in the face of the Delta's intractable poverty. Lavorn Burnett, 51, and her husband, Donal, 52, own a service station next to Jonestown's cramped City Hall. They use the health clinic of Manette Durand, 60-ish, a member of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet.
A nurse practitioner, Sister Manette is the only health care provider in town. "She can do everything but cutting," Mrs. Burnett said. "She takes time to talk to you. You can call her if you're having a problem. You can talk to her like friends. She gives you the advice you need to make a decision.
"And Sister Kay, Sister Kay has this carpentry class. She teaches the kids through working. One kid built a porch for his house. I don't want you to think I'm glorifying the nuns. It's just what we've seen here."
Judy Phillips, manager of a community preservation program at Mississippi State University that oversees a grant to renovate a long-abandoned school, said, "I can't think of any entity that is more important to Jonestown than the sisters." 
More than local churches, businesses or government agencies, Ms. Phillips said, "they are the true support net within that community." 
Viewed by the usual measures of community health, Jonestown sits on the floor of the nation's cellar. The 2000 census deemed half its families poor, compared with 9 percent nationwide. The median family income was $15,750, nearly $27,000 less than the national median.
In communities with 1,000 or more people, Jonestown had the second-highest rate of single-mother households, 32 percent, after Ford Heights, Ill., near Chicago. The median age of single mothers here was 21. The national median was 35. 
More than half of the adults in town do not work, the census found. One reason is education. Fewer than half the adults over 25 have high school diplomas. Another reason is transportation. Almost one in three households do not have a car. There is no public transportation. 
"Some of our folks have never had decent shoes on, so they have impaired feet," Sister Manette said.
She trims corns and nails and bathes patients' feet in a whirlpool. She treats many knife and gunshot wounds, too, and the chronic diseases of the poor, like hypertension, diabetes and osteoarthritis.
However bleak, the statistics obscure crosscurrents of pride and resilience. "We don't have any suicides," Sister Manette said. 
After falling for years, the population has grown 38 percent in the last 20 years. Jonestown's cottonseed oil mill has survived the many mill closings in other Delta towns. New jobs have opened in the casinos of Tunica County, 35 miles away, to which young mothers here commute on casino-financed buses. 
The gauges of poverty apply to the Burnetts in some ways but not in others. They are qualified for food stamps and welfare but never applied. They economized with chicken, they said. They reared their five children in a three-bedroom trailer behind their service station. Four of the children have finished college, and one is still attending. The Burnetts said the sisters helped steer the children through school and beyond. 
The nuns and the Burnetts worked together to develop newspaper routes to deliver The Clarksdale Press Register. "The children would come in in the evening and roll those papers up and get them to the readers," Mrs. Burnett said.
Mr. Burnett said, "If the nuns hear of something the community can benefit from, they try to get you into it."
Across Main Street from the Burnetts' business is Uptown Brown, a take-out barbecue shop. Bennie Brown, 49, the second-generation owner, has just opened a youth center in the shuttered school.
With sports programs there, Mr. Brown wants to steer young people ages 10 to 18 from the drugs sold openly here. Sister Teresa Shields of the Holy Name order, who runs tutoring and social programs for children in kindergarten to sixth grade, helped organize the center and is a member of its board.
The nuns have touched Mr. Brown in another way, too.
"I think the Lord was calling for this work to be done," he said. "But the people here hadn't made themselves available. By watching the nuns, they inspired me to be involved in a ministry. I learned to put my whole self into what I learned from them."
Three years ago, Mr. Brown was ordained a Baptist minister. A year later he became pastor of St. Paul's Ministry, one of Jonestown's five churches, all a century old and none of them Roman Catholic.
Townspeople know of no Catholics among them, other than the nuns. When Bishop William Houck of the Jackson Diocese invited the nuns into the towns, Sister Kay said, "he told us we were not to evangelize but to educate." 
"We're teachers," she said.
Sister Kay lives in a large, white stucco house two blocks from City Hall, next to the new Montessori school, where two sisters from Clarksdale teach. Her bedroom is next to the kitchen. Volunteers, often college students on vacation, stay in a dormitory upstairs and in two rooms downstairs.
Scattered about are three pianos, four electric keyboards and four computers, all donated. In the living room on many evenings, about 30 teenage participants in Sister Kay's Girls to Women program settle around the living room to recite poetry, perform skits, watch videotapes and begin planning careers. 
A large sunny room in back is Sister Kay's classroom, with four tables joined in a square. Teenage students come in for tutoring. Older people stop in for help in earning high school equivalency diplomas. 
"My purpose is to promote the idea that as people become educated, they will volunteer to help others when we pass on," Sister Kay said.
Often, economists and sociologists suggest that Delta towns once rooted in agriculture have outlived their purpose with the mechanization of farming. They suggest that the young move to communities with more jobs and that the towns be plowed back into cotton.
Valid or not, it is not a proposition that engages the nuns. "There are 600 children in elementary school here," said Sister Teresa, 57. "Whether they eventually leave or grow up here, they deserve the best."

HEADLINE: Dorm Style: Gothic Castle vs. Futuristic Sponge 

BYLINE:  By FRED BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
The last time Princeton University significantly increased the size of its freshman class, in 1969, it needed to build a new dormitory -- fast. I. M. Pei designed an angular glass and concrete building, Spelman Hall, which went on to win a number of design awards.
 Now Princeton is increasing its enrollment again, and the dorms it is planning could not be more unlike Spelman. The university is preparing to build a 500-bed residential college in the collegiate gothic style. 
 Picture ivy-covered stone walls, with archways, crenelations and gargoyles, reaching up to quaint slate roofs punctuated by gables and chimneys, and you have pictured collegiate gothic, a style with roots in the cathedrals of the Middle Ages. 
Princeton's effort, which will require skilled masons to cut thousands of pieces of stone on the site, will cost more than $100 million, an astonishing $200,000 per bed. (In addition to dorm rooms, the buildings will include a dining hall, a library and a master's suite.)
That is about double what colleges typically spend on dormitory space. But in the world of elite colleges, it isn't the cost that is stirring controversy; it is the architecture.
William Mitchell, dean of the architecture school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has called Princeton's approach "silly" and "stultifying."
M.I.T. recently opened a new dorm of its own, with 350 beds, at a cost of $68 million -- just under $200,000 a bed. But that dorm, Simmons Hall, is by the New York architect Steven Holl, a modernist.
Dean Mitchell described Princeton's choice as "roughly the equivalent of requiring all e-mail to be written in Shakespearean English" and said it signaled "an astonishing lack of interest in architecture's capacity to respond innovatively and critically to the conditions of our own time and place."
The prime mover behind Princeton's new residential college is Meg Whitman, the president of eBay, a Princeton trustee and a member of the class of 1977. Ms. Whitman wrote, in an e-mail message -- without a hint of Shakespeare -- that her "fondest memories" of Princeton involved the old-style dorms in which she lived for four years.
"Collegiate gothic sets an ambience for learning that had a very positive impact on me," wrote Ms. Whitman, who, as if to prove her point, has pledged $30 million for the project, which will bear her name.
Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, dean of the University of Miami School of Architecture and a Princeton trustee, said she thought that collegiate gothic -- the style of Oxford and Cambridge Universities -- reminded students that they were "part of a long tradition of intellectual life."
Ms. Plater-Zyberk said that Princeton had by no means abandoned modern architecture. It is about to erect a science library designed by Frank Gehry, and has recently completed buildings by prominent modernists like Rafael Vinoly and Enrique Norten. 
The problem, she said, was that, with so many modern buildings going up, "the beloved historic quadrant of the campus" was shrinking relative to the rest of the campus.
The solution, in the view of Princeton's director of physical planning, Jon Hlafter, was to create "campus neighborhoods," giving academic, administrative, athletic and residential buildings separate identities, each based largely on architectural style.
To design Whitman College, Mr. Hlafter chose Demetri Porphyrios, a Princeton graduate best known for designing a 1990's quadrangle at Magdalen College, Oxford, that blends in with the much older buildings around it. 
Mr. Porphyrios will probably not be getting a call from M.I.T. The institute's new dorm is covered with a gridded concrete-and-metal facade (inspired, according to Mr. Holl, by a bathroom sponge). The futuristic, brightly colored building towers over the M.I.T. campus.
Inside, extra wide hallways are meant as places to spend time in. Common rooms are enclosed in multilevel spaces that evoke the inside of volcanoes.
Vikash Gilja, an M.I.T. freshman, had several complaints: the ladder to his raised bed fell apart (so he now climbs up on bookshelves). And the gridded facade gives his room 15 separate windows, meaning he has to adjust 15 curtains when he wants more or less sunlight.
In plan, Simmons is fairly conventional: lots of single rooms that open onto hallways, interrupted occasionally by common rooms. Double and triple rooms are going out of fashion, according to William Rawn, a Boston architect who is designing dormitories at Williams, Amherst and Swarthmore Colleges. 
"More and more kids are coming from households where they have their own bedrooms and they are expecting to have the same in college," Mr. Rawn said. 
In addition, he said, "Today's sexual mores are leading to the desire to have single bedrooms." 
Mr. Rawn said a typical suite these days may have four single bedrooms, as opposed to the two doubles of a generation ago. The proliferation of singles raises the cost of construction. Then, because there are so many singles, Mr. Rawn said, the universities need more and bigger common areas, to foster a sense of community.
Mr. Rawn likes to create community by making hallways that attract students. An effective hallway, he said, is "so wide that it becomes like an urban street."
Another way to create community is to build dormitories around courtyards. Dean Mitchell of M.I.T. said that despite his dislike for the style, "the urban design principles underlying the collegiate gothic quadrangles are perfectly sensible."
At Princeton, suites of double and even triple rooms with fireplaces -- and long hikes to communal bathrooms -- were common in the dormitories built before World War II. The narrow buildings could not accommodate hallways. Instead, rooms were arranged around stairwells, called entryways, with their own doors to outside.
All these features will be missing from the new Whitman College. Fire regulations and disability laws effectively require hallways serviced by multiple stairways and elevators. Fireplaces are considered unsafe.
In plan, there is not that much difference between Simmons and Whitman. The gap is stylistic.
Most colleges, including New York University and Columbia, have avoided the extremes. N.Y.U.'s newest dorms, including one on the Bowery and several on East 14th Street, are innocuous, indistinguishable from the apartment buildings all around them.
Of course, few colleges can afford the Princeton-M.I.T. approach.
Mr. Rawn, the Boston architect, said colleges typically spend $100,000 or less per bed. "Princeton and M.I.T. have raised the bar," he said. Whitman will require 2,500 tons of stone, cut on the site and fit into load-bearing walls 16 inches thick. Simmons, by contrast, required thousands of perforated-wood ceiling panels, no two alike. In both cases, economies of scale were sacrificed to style.
In the dormitories he designs, Mr. Rawn prefers the middle ground. "All architecture," he said, "is about memory and invention. Each school has to find the right balance of those two things."

HEADLINE: For Professor, A Town House Fit for a King 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
It is not quite in the same league as a $1 million contribution to a nursery school to help a star employee's children win admission. But Columbia University seems to have spared little expense in acquiring living and office space for Jeffrey D. Sachs, the star economics professor it lured from Harvard this year. 
 Many Columbia professors live in comfortable university-owned apartments with Hudson River views. But most do not command the $8 million price tag that Columbia paid for a refurbished 85th Street town house for Dr. Sachs and the Columbia Earth Institute, which he directs. 
 The two bottom floors will hold a reception area for the institute, which also has researchers on Columbia's main campus in Morningside Heights, at the Lamont-Doherty campus in Palisades, N.Y., and in Latin America and Africa. Dr. Sachs and his family will rent the three upper floors.
Mariellen Gallagher, a spokeswoman for the Earth Institute, declined to disclose the rental fee, but she said it would be at a "normal faculty rate."
She said that the gym and sauna in the basement were being converted into a conference center and library. 
Columbia said the house had not been bought for Dr. Sachs but to foster the university's global outreach and its collaboration with global leaders; it will be used for dinners, receptions and meetings for scientists, economists and other international leaders in government and business. The institute has an operating budget of $10 million to $15 million and Dr. Sachs will be responsible for helping raise some of the financing.
An international economist known for his strong views about how the developed world should help eradicate poverty in developing nations, Dr. Sachs, 48, is also a special adviser to the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan.

HEADLINE: In Search of a Mission 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Nov. 19 

 BODY:
At any other time during the last 50 years, a summit meeting of the Western alliance would be a gathering radiating the unmistakable military power these leaders could throw against any security threat to Europe or the United States.
 But after a year of American-led combat operations in Afghanistan, where NATO countries played a marginal role, and now with the prospect of war in Iraq, the grand alliance has never seemed more on the sidelines. 
 With President Bush here to meet with leaders from NATO's 18 other members and to welcome seven new ones, the most urgent task facing the assembly will be to rescue the alliance from obscurity.
"The fact of the matter is that the main threat is gone and NATO has become far less relevant," said James R. Schlesinger, the former American defense secretary who spent a cold war career burnishing a trans-Atlantic military machine designed to defend Europe and the West from the onslaught of Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces. 
Nonetheless, a resuscitation package has taken shape in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, one that goes well beyond the retooling and reform that has been a work in progress at NATO's Brussels headquarters since the Soviet Union dissolved.
The effort is centered on creating a NATO rapid response force that could move swiftly with light, technologically advanced weapons around the world to strike at new threats from terrorists or rogue nations with weapons of mass destruction. 
First broached by Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Warsaw in late September, the new template would bring NATO closer into alignment with the Bush administration's military strategy. The reach would be more global than previously sketched plans for an all-European defense force.
In the new NATO, commanders would ease requirements that all members contribute proportionately to the common defense. Instead, contributions could be based on areas of specialization, which Mr. Bush referred to on Monday, an idea that allows the smaller and weaker members to find a niche in NATO's force. 
One country could provide a unit trained for mountain warfare, another could contribute decontamination teams for troops facing chemical or biological weapons, another military police. In effect, this would be an extension of strengths already demonstrated: the Czechs, for example, might be able to deploy units specializing in chemical warfare -- as they did in 1991 -- if the Iraqis mount such an attack.
Still, a number of experts say it could take years for NATO to emerge as an effective global military alliance, partly because of strained budgets in Europe, enormous gaps in military capacity among member countries and political divisions over America's role as the dominant power.
Lord Robertson, NATO's secretary general and the most ardent booster for reinvigorating the alliance, acknowledged those divisions in a recent speech in Berlin. He said fundamental questions were afoot about the alliance's future, among them: "Is Washington committed to genuine multilateralism?" -- working with traditional partners like NATO -- and "How can Europe exert more influence on the world's only superpower?"
"The urge to find answers to these questions," he said, "must not distract us from the fundamental issue: the trans-Atlantic relationship remains indispensable for our safety and security."
In the first decade after the Soviet collapse, NATO showed that it could adapt for interventions on the periphery of Europe when ethnic conflict in the Balkans threatened to destabilize the continent.
But the Sept. 11 attacks and the Bush administration's dramatic deployment of military forces to Southwest Asia -- followed by the buildup now under way in the Persian Gulf near Iraq -- present NATO with a more profound existential question: can a multinational alliance reach a consensus on when and how to attack terrorists or rogue states threatening Western security?
Most Europeans devoted to maintaining the trans-Atlantic bonds created during World War II have watched and listened with puzzlement and pique to the policy arguments emanating from Mr. Bush's Washington. There, many conservatives have argued that formal alliances may be a thing of the past, since they limit America's ability to act decisvely and on its own schedule as Mr. Bush says he is prepared to do in Iraq.
Mr. Schlesinger said it may be inevitable for the major Western powers to tend to drift apart under the pull of domestic politics and economic strain. Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany has already declared his unwillingness to take part in military action against Iraq.
"Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, I've said the most important thing is the North Atlantic alliance itself, not its military capabilities," Mr. Schlesinger said. He urged leaders to look at "the psychological bonds of the North Atlantic Treaty" to help keep them from drifting apart.
Yet this summit meeting is very much about military strength. If NATO does not get new abilities to move forces rapidly and connect them electronically, it could devolve into a political club in which members with modern military forces would act outside the alliance, together or separately, depending on calculations of national interest.
A number of Western diplomats arriving here said it was not too late for NATO, in whole or part, to take part in a campaign to disarm Iraq, even though the bulk of the war planning has been under way in the Pentagon and at the United States Central Command headquarters.
"Our readiness to participate will depend on whether the United Nations Security Council will be at the center of deliberations on Iraq and any military operation that flows from that," a Danish diplomat said.
A French diplomat, referring to an armed action against Iraq, said: "Who knows who will be involved? We hope there will be unanimous support from NATO to the United Nations resolution on Iraq -- that would be a strong political signal -- but it is a little too early to know what comes next."
Many NATO members are concerned that a Bush administration decision to act on its own with a coalition of the willing could do significant damage to the United Nations and to NATO.
"If we do not make some far-reaching decisions this week to reform NATO and orient the alliance toward the future," the Danish diplomat said, "and then we see that NATO is kept on the sidelines in the biggest military confrontation of our times, then it will damage NATO, and I think everyone understands this."

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Hardware: NCR To Dismiss 5% Of Work Force 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 The NCR Corporation said yesterday that it planned to dismiss about 1,500 workers, or 5 percent of its staff, as the company, the world's largest seller of automated teller machines, continues to reduce costs amid slumping sales of hardware. About 200 of the cuts will be made in Dayton, Ohio, where the company is based, said Jeff Dafler, a spokesman. 
Workers were notified of the decision yesterday, he said. Sales of retail checkout and teller machines are faltering as corporate customers reduce spending amid slower economic growth. Cost-cutting helped NCR swing to a profit of $41 million in the third quarter from a year-earlier loss. Sales dropped 4.5 percent, to $1.38 billion, the fifth straight quarterly decline. Shares of NCR fell 20 cents, to $23.80.

HEADLINE: Acquisitions and New Clothing Give a Lift to Burberry's Profits 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 19 

 BODY:
An expansion strategy based on acquisitions, new stores and new offerings like sleek handbags and children's clothing bearing its signature plaid pattern seem to be working for the Burberry Group. The company reported results for the first half of its fiscal year today that exceeded market expectations.
 So far at least, Burberry has managed to keep sales and profits growing in a year when many rival fashion companies are suffering from economic sluggishness and from tourists' staying home because of the threat of terror attacks. 
 Rose Marie Bravo, Burberry's chief executive and the architect of its metamorphosis from a dowdy raincoat maker to a fashion house, said that she saw no signs of a slowdown.
"There is so much more we can do with this brand," Ms. Bravo said today.
Burberry has added accessories like handbags, which yield higher margins than clothing, as well as a line of children's wear to expand sales.
It bought distributors in Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore to gain better control over the supply of its products to those regions. And it has opened five new Burberry retail outlets in the last six months, including a flagship store on East 57th Street in Manhattan.
The New York store uses glass, slate and strategic lighting to form a pattern on its facade that echoes the Burberry plaid.
In the store's penthouse level, which is devoted to men, shoppers can have a drink in a private club area while they wait for tailoring.
"Thankfully, men are getting dressed again," Ms. Bravo said.
For some shoppers, the must-have Burberry item of the season may be a custom-made trench coat. Those willing to pay 30 percent more than typical retail prices can choose from 26 colors of gabardine, and snuggle into a removable liner made of cashmere or camel hair.
"When it comes to product development, Burberry is really making strides," said Sagra Maceira de Rosen, an analyst at J. P. Morgan Chase.
Burberry also has plans to reintroduce its Thomas Burberry brand, which was shelved by Ms. Bravo several years ago when she was reformulating the Burberry image. Intended to rival Armani Exchange or Polo Jeans, the new Thomas Burberry line will be introduced for fall/winter 2003, Ms. Bravo said, and will be sold in department stores and specialty stores.
The company said today that its operating profit for the six months ended Sept. 30 was $:55.1 million ($87 million), up from $:39.2 million in the period a year earlier. The 2002 profit excludes one-time charges for the effects of currency fluctuations and for costs related to the initial stock offering in July, when the company's parent -- GUS, the British retailer -- sold 22.5 percent of it to the public. Revenue in the half-year rose 15 percent to $:274 million ($433 million).
Still, after climbing sharply over the last month, Burberry's shares fell 11 pence, to $:2.36.

Weak Outlook From Home Depot Holds Market Down

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks ended a seesaw session lower yesterday as a disappointing outlook from Home Depot overshadowed hopes that a slowly improving economy will help spur a rebound in corporate profits.
 Investors also pulled back in response to the recent rally that has sent the Dow Jones industrial average up about 16 percent since it touched a five-year low in October. 
 "There are a ton of people on the sidelines," said William McKenna, senior trader at the Friedman, Billings Ramsey Group. "The market's had a decent rally over the last few weeks, and we're taking a breather." 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 11.79 points, or 0.14 percent, at 8,475.78. During the choppy session, the average fell as much as 1 percent and rose as much as 0.7 percent.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 3.62 points, or 0.40 percent, at 896.74. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index was down 19.18 points, or 1.38 percent, at 1,374.51. 
"We are consolidating and digesting the gains; there are no big headlines out there to move us higher," said Paul Cherney, market analyst at S.& P. Marketscope. "Right now equity markets seem to have established a sideways trading pattern." 
Shares in Home Depot sank $3.69, or 13 percent, to $24.91. The company said fourth-quarter sales at stores open at least a year could fall as much as 5 percent, and full-year sales would fall short of longer-term growth goals. 
Home Depot's rival, Lowe's, fell $1.72, to $38.98. 
Sharp declines in Home Depot spurred investors to pocket gains from Wall Street's recent upswing. 
The six-week rally through Friday was the Dow's longest winning stretch since another six-week streak of gains that ended May 7, 1999. 
"You have had a pretty decent run," said Dan McMahon, head of listed trading at CIBC World Markets. "The majority of the pundits will say it's too much, too soon. So you have to look for a little bit of profit taking, particularly with the uncertainty in the Middle East." 
The tax preparer, H & R Block, rallied $2.35, or 6.7 percent, to $37.53 after it said it had settled a class-action suit in Texas involving loans that were given in anticipation of tax refunds. Under the settlement, Block will provide coupons to plaintiffs for tax preparation services. 
Shares in the office supply retailer, Staples, jumped $2.16, or 13 percent, to $18.39, after it said that third-quarter earnings rose 40 percent, helped by expansion of its delivery business and improved profit margins. 
The computer chip maker Advanced Micro Devices slumped 94 cents, or 14 percent, to $5.58. The company said it would sell $300 million of senior notes convertible into company stock. 
In addition, Standard & Poor's cut Advanced Micro's credit rating, citing worries about the company's ability to improve profits amid a weak personal computer market. 
The latest economic data relieved some fears about possible deflation. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent in October after September's 0.2 percent gain, a government report showed. 
In the bond market, Treasury prices traded in a narrow range yesterday, little affected by the October inflation report or the September trade deficit.
The price of the Treasury's 10-year note in late trading was 100 6/32, with a yield of 3.98 percent.
The price of the 30-year bond was 108 1/32, with a yield of 4.85 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Psychotherapy Shows a Rise Over Decade, But Time Falls 

BYLINE:  By ERICA GOODE 

 BODY:
The number of Americans who received psychotherapy increased slightly from 1987 to 1997, according to a large national study, and rose significantly for two groups: older adults and the unemployed.
 But the average length of time patients spent in the consulting room dropped precipitously over the same period, the study found, and the percentage of patients who combined psychotherapy with psychiatric medication nearly doubled. 
 The researchers said the findings reflected the impact of managed care and the growing popularity of brief forms of psychotherapy, as well as the wider use of antidepressants and other drugs to treat many mental disorders. But the study's results, they said, also indicated that despite these changes, access to psychotherapy had increased for some groups, and that talk therapy remained, for many people, an important component of mental health treatment. 
"With all the attention given to antidepressants and other medications, the role of psychotherapy can be easily overshadowed," said Dr. Mark Olfson, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University and the lead author of the study, which appeared in the November issue of The American Journal of Psychiatry. "But these findings make clear that psychotherapy continues to play an important role in the mental health care of many Americans."
The study, based on data collected in two national surveys by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, is the largest to examine the patterns of psychotherapy use over time.
Dr. Olfson said talk therapy represented a smaller proportion of all mental health treatment in 1997 than in 1987.
But in absolute numbers, psychotherapy's popularity remained steady, and even experienced a slight increase. In 1987, 7.85 million people -- or 3.24 percent of the nation's population -- visited mental health professionals for psychotherapy, the study found. Ten years later, that number had risen to 9.69 million or 3.59 percent. The increase was not statistically significant, the researchers said.
In contrast, the researchers noted large increases in the use of psychotherapy among people from the ages of 55 to 64, a little over 836,000 or 3.92 percent of whom received psychotherapy in 1997 compared with 455,000 or 2.02 percent in 1987. The number of unemployed adults making visits to mental health professionals also rose significantly, to close to 3 million or 4.62 percent in 1997 from 2.2 million or 3.33 percent in 1987.
The new study makes it apparent that although psychotherapy is holding its ground, few people these days undertake a lengthy sojourn on the couch. The percentage of patients who saw therapists for more than 20 sessions dropped to 10.26 in 1997 from 15.69 in 1987. Slightly over 33 percent attended only 1 or 2 sessions. The proportion of psychotherapy patients who also took psychiatric medication, on the other hand, increased to 61.52 percent in 1997 from 31.52 percent a decade earlier. 
Dr. Harold Pincus, the director of the Rand University of Pittsburgh Health Institute and an author of the study, said the same factors responsible for the increased use of psychiatric medication, including a greater public awareness of depression and other psychiatric conditions and the gradual lessening of the stigma attached to mental illness, might also be drawing more people in these groups to psychotherapy.
"A rising tide raises all boats," Dr. Pincus said.
Depression, manic-depression and other so-called mood disorders were by far the most common diagnoses given to patients who received psychotherapy in 1997: Almost 39.09 percent of the patients surveyed were listed on insurance forms as suffering from depression or another mood disorder, compared with 19.51 percent 10 years earlier.
In a study based on the same surveys published last January, Dr. Olfson and his colleagues found that the number of Americans being treated for depression on an out-of-hospital basis more than tripled from 1987 to 1997 and the proportion of those in treatment who were taking antidepressant drugs doubled.
In the surveys, the participants kept diaries in which they recorded visits to mental health professionals for psychotherapy or counseling. One weakness of the study, the researchers and other experts said, was that there was no way to know what type of psychotherapy the participants received.
"I think that really is an important thing to study," said Dr. Darrel A. Regier, executive director of the American Psychiatric Association's Institute for Research and Education. A variety of studies have shown that some types of psychotherapy to be highly effective, Dr. Regier noted, but "there are a lot more studies on medication than on psychotherapy."

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit a Bit Lower; Consumer Prices Up 0.3% 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19 

 BODY:
The trade deficit edged down in September, but was still the second highest on record, while higher energy costs nudged consumer prices slightly higher in October, government reports released today showed. 
 The September trade deficit shrank by 0.65 percent, to $38.03 billion, from the record of $38.28 billion in August, the Commerce Department said. 
 While that figure represented a slight improvement from the month before, its size nonetheless underlined concern that so large a trade imbalance could lead to a sharp fall in the value of the dollar, which has already declined 15 percent this year on a trade-weighted basis. 
"The trade deficit continues to be an issue," said Asha Bangalore, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "It narrowed slightly, but the issue here is we have a very big trade deficit as a percentage of G.D.P. that poses a threat to the value of the dollar down the road, though not immediately."
Many economists were expecting imports to decline more in September, after a jump in August as companies stockpiled goods in anticipation of a work stoppage at ports on the West Coast. 
Imports totaled $120.19 billion in September, down just 0.5 percent from the year-to-date high of $120.78 billion in August. Exports, which rose more or less steadily in the first half of 2002, declined in September for the second consecutive month -- down 0.4 percent, to $82.16 billion, as the global economy struggled. 
Economists said, though, that the buildup of inventories could lead to a narrowing of the trade deficit in coming months. "I would assume the trade deficit in October is going to be quite a bit narrower," said Ram Bhagavatula, chief economist for financial markets with the Royal Bank of Scotland in New York. 
In a separate report, the Labor Department said today that a 1.9 percent rise in energy prices accounted for half of a 0.3 percent advance in October in the Consumer Price Index. Excluding food and energy prices, the index was up 0.2 percent, leaving economists with little worry that inflation would get out of control. A report last week indicated that overall producer prices rose in October by a steep 1.1 percent. 
"Inflation is not a problem, but it is not completely tame," said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pa. 
Ms. Bangalore at Northern Trust said the Consumer Price Index was close to expectations. "The energy prices were up," she said, "but you will see some moderation in November because energy prices in November have already come down."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: LIABILITY; 
Senate Passes Bill Limiting Insurers' Liability After an Attack

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
The Senate adopted legislation yesterday requiring the federal government rather than insurance companies to pay the overwhelming majority of financial losses in a terrorist attack, triumphantly ending a long, determined campaign by President Bush.
 By a vote of 86 to 11, the Senate endorsed a program passed last Thursday by the House that provides for the government to pay up to $100 billion in terrorism losses annually for three years. 
 Mr. Bush was in Europe last night, but his administration and the nation's insurers and bankers, as well as real estate and construction companies, hailed the passage of the legislation as a strong shot in the arm for the country's struggling economy. 
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill called passage of the legislation "perhaps the single most important thing we can do to boost job creation in the short run, as well as minimize negative economic consequences of possible future attacks."
But having achieved their long-sought goal, the insurers were looking ahead with trepidation.
"Now the real work begins," said Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman for the American Insurance Association. "We have to implement this program. That is not going to be easy. This is still a volatile situation with a lot of risk."
The legislation requires all commercial insurers to begin immediately offering terrorism coverage, which they had provided free with commercial coverage until the attacks last year at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
After losses in those attacks estimated at more than $40 billion, the insurers withdrew the coverage and began appealing for help from Washington. Gradually, some insurers reintroduced terrorism insurance but in limited amounts at very high prices.
While the legislation provides for unlimited availability, it does not address the question of price. Some insurance executives say costs will probably remain high until the companies are better able to gauge their potential losses. Even though the legislation sharply limits the insurers losses, they say they still have no way of knowing how often or how forcefully terrorists may strike and therefore how much to charge. The legislation is also expected to have little immediate effect on the soaring price of other commercial coverages.
Still, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said he believed federally backed insurance would have a strong impact in New York City.
"Many in New York can't get terrorism insurance and those who can have been put at an extreme disadvantage because it's so expensive," Mr. Schumer said. "This has basically hurt New York and other cities more than other places."
Mr. Schumer said that part of the reason for passing the legislation was to reduce prices and that he believed that would happen.
Under the legislation, the government will pay 90 percent of the cost of a terrorist attack after losses are greater than $10 billion. For lesser damages during the first year of the program, the insurance companies will pay up to the equivalent of 7 percent of their premiums toward damages with the government picking up the rest of the costs. In the third year, the insurers will be required to pay up to 15 percent of their premiums with the 90 percent share for the government kicking in at $15 billion in losses.
Mr. Bush contended that providing terrorism insurance was vital to the country's economic recovery. Because of the lack of coverage, he said, billions of dollars in construction projects and real estate transactions have been stalled and several hundred thousand construction workers are jobless.
Some economists and consumer advocates contended that insurance was just one of many reasons that construction and real estate companies and banks were struggling.
But Mr. Bush intensified his effort just before the Nov. 5 election. Some Republicans in the House objected to the bill in its final form because it permits victims of terrorists attacks to sue corporations for punitive damages. But Mr. Bush won them over last week with personal phone calls and meetings and a pledge to strive next year for sharp limitations on lawsuits against corporations.
"The president has been very, very helpful on this bill, very engaged," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut.
Senate Democrats and Republicans said Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, threatened to block the legislation late last week. But Mr. Gramm relented, both sides said, after receiving assurances that Democrats would not try to severely undermine the domestic security bill. 
An aide to Mr. Gramm and White House officials acknowledged that Mr. Bush had spoken with the senator late last week. "He called him to make sure things were in line for the bill to be passed and sent to his desk," a senior White House official said. An aide to Mr. Gramm would not discuss the conversation, but said that by the time the president called, the senator had already decided to let the bill proceed.
The White House official said Mr. Bush continued to urge support for the bill until shortly before leaving for Europe early yesterday. "He has, on a daily basis, made what I would call baby-sitting phone calls to make sure the temperature was correct for passage of the bill," the White House official said.

HEADLINE: Singapore And U.S. Near A Trade Deal 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19 

 BODY:
The United States reached a tentative free-trade agreement with Singapore today, the first of what the Bush administration hopes will be a web of similar deals worldwide.
 But even after two years of work, and talks that stretched until just before dawn this morning, the two countries could not reach a final agreement because of disputes about Singapore's ability to impose capital controls in a financial crisis. 
 The new agreement, if completed and approved by Congress, would eliminate tariffs on about $33 billion in trade between the two countries and would give American banks and service companies more access to one of Asia's main financial centers.
It is probably more important as an indicator of the United States' new strategy in opening up global trade markets. 
That strategy increasingly relies on negotiating deals with individual countries and small regions, in part to build support for more ambitious projects, like a "free trade agreement for the Americas" and a new global trade agreement at the World Trade Organization.
In addition to Singapore, the White House hopes to wrap up a free-trade deal with Chile by the end of the year. It is also starting talks with five countries in Central America and with Australia, and it is trying to open talks with other countries in Southeast Asia.
But the United States is actually behind the European Union, which has already negotiated its own market-opening deals with Chile and several other countries.
Reaching an agreement with Singapore is easier than with many countries because it has historically been a free-trade port for imported goods and it is a high-wage country with a modern service-based economy.
The Bush administration is still wrestling with Chile, eight years after the United States first proposed a free-trade deal with that country, on how it will enforce its labor and environmental regulations.
Negotiating a free-trade deal with Australia will face far larger political obstacles because Australia is one of the United States' biggest rivals in global agriculture production.
American agriculture remains highly protected by both tariffs and government subsidies, and farm lobbies have enormous political influence in Washington.
In Singapore, American officials have yet to persuade leaders that they should forsake the ability to block companies from moving money out of that island nation in times of financial crisis.
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, told reporters in Singapore today that the two countries had achieved the substance of a free-trade agreement. Officials from both countries said they hoped to resolve the last obstacle in the next few weeks.
Mr. Zoellick has sharply accelerated his push for bilateral free-trade deals since late July, when Congress passed legislation that gives the administration the authority to negotiate trade deals and then submit them to Congress for a simple yes-or-no vote without changes or amendments.
Mr. Zoellick's strategy is based on what he calls "competitive liberalization," the idea that a bilateral trade agreement with one country puts pressure on others to seek their own deals with the United States.
Immediately after he finished talks in Singapore, Mr. Zoellick flew to a meeting in Manila today of economic ministers from Southeast Asian nations, including the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. 
"I firmly believe that a process of competitive liberalization will enhance our ability" to negotiate broader market-opening agreements, Mr. Zoellick told reporters in Singapore today.
Because Singapore has always been a free port for most imported goods, the agreement would not affect American exports of products. The main effect for American companies is in opening markets for services, like banking and investment management, legal services, engineering, and architecture.
Just today, in a nod to the proposed agreement, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said it would gradually lift its restrictions on licenses for American banks, allowing them to offer a full range of services and expand their networks of branches and automated teller machines.
The agreement would also expand the ability of foreign law firms, most of which are prohibited from practicing local law, to operate in Singapore. 
Singapore would be freed from tariffs on exports to the United States. One of its biggest benefits would be to get tariff-free treatment for products whose components are largely produced on two nearby islands in Indonesia, where wages are much lower.
Negotiators from both countries said they hoped to resolve the issue of capital controls quickly, clearing the way for a final deal.
But Mr. Zoellick apparently did not break down Singapore's resistance on another issue: its longtime ban on chewing gum, a prohibition ordered to keep the nation's streets and sidewalks cleaner.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Gets Choice: Raise Transit Fares, Cut Service, or Both 

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY and MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will propose either raising transit fares and tolls, reducing service or a combination of both when the agency's board meets tomorrow, state officials said yesterday.
 The officials said the board would be presented with three choices, each of them involving difficult trade-offs for riders. If the basic fare remains the same -- $1.50 for subways and buses -- "service cuts in all areas" will be necessary to repair the agency's budget, one official said. If the fare is increased to $1.75 -- with similar increases in bridge and tunnel tolls, the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Railroad -- service cuts would still need to be imposed on nights and weekends, where transit ridership has increased markedly in recent years. 
 Or to keep service for riders at present levels, fares would be increased to $2 -- a 33 percent increase that would also be applied to tolls and commuter rail.
The news that commuters could end up either paying more or facing service cuts comes in the wake of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plans to impose higher property taxes in New York City and to tax commuters who work in the city. Yesterday, however, Gov. George E. Pataki repeated his opposition to the commuter tax plan, throwing into doubt a key component of the Mayor's strategy to close the budget gap.
Taken together, the issues underscore the serious budget problems being confronted by governments and public agencies across the metropolitan region as they struggle to deal with a sagging economy and the failure to deal with major budget issues until after the Nov. 5 election.
The transit proposal by the M.T.A. chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, sets the stage for fare increases or service cuts that could take effect by next spring, after public hearings that are required by law.
"They're going to begin the process of outlining the issues that they face," said a top aide to Governor Pataki, who controls the M.T.A. board.
The official said that the board must begin to face the agency's "fiscal challenges, and also begin to look at various scenarios of how to deal with that, from no fare increase to various levels of fare increase."
"And obviously," the official added, "each one has a range of implications including, with no fare increase, some service reductions."
The basic transit fare was last increased in 1995, to $1.50 from $1.25. While Governor Pataki repeatedly expressed his opposition to an increase during his recent bid for re-election, it was widely expected that his administration would begin moving rapidly toward one after the election. Though transit officials have been extraordinarily secretive about the details of the M.T.A. budget, they contend that the agency's $7.5 billion operating budget now faces a $600 million deficit in the coming fiscal year.
Unlike his predecessors at City Hall, who were generally vocal opponents of fare increases, Mr. Bloomberg has characterized an increase as an inevitability, a position that could help soften the political damage that Mr. Pataki might suffer as a result.
But yesterday, Mr. Pataki did not seem willing to return the favor to Mr. Bloomberg by supporting a commuter tax for the city, which faces a $6.4 billion gap in the fiscal year beginning July 1.
By adding his opposition to that of the State Senate, which called the plan "a nonstarter" this week, Mr. Pataki appeared to doom Mr. Bloomberg's proposal to impose a 2.7 percent city income tax on people who work in the city but do not live there. The city would need Albany's permission for such a tax.
"I think I made my position plain during the campaign," Mr. Pataki said at a news conference at which he spoke publicly for the first time about Mr. Bloomberg's commuter tax proposal, "and I'll have no comment as the budget process goes forward."
A transit fare increase could end up aiding the city somewhat, because it would set the stage for the M.T.A. to take over seven private Queens bus lines, to which the city now pays more than $150 million a year in subsidies. But those savings would be relatively minor given the city's current budget straits.
Some transit officials contend that it is simply time for a fare increase, after seven years in which the average fare has actually dropped to $1.06 with the help of MetroCard discounts.
In the mid 1990's, the M.T.A. recovered from serious financial problems partly as a result of the steep rise in ridership spurred by those discounts and by service improvements.
But officials now say that the agency faces a huge budget gap, $600 million next year, largely because of the weak economy, declining help from dedicated taxes that support the transit system and little likelihood of more aid from either the city or state. The agency has also recently begun negotiating its labor contract, which represents the largest part of its operating budget.
Opponents of a fare increase, including Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, contend that the agency's problems might be much less serious than officials assert. The opponents say that resistance to either an increase or service cuts will be vocal and aggressive unless the agency proves its case.
"The M.T.A. has to really let the public know how bad the problem is, and what the issues are," said Beverly Dolinsky, the executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the M.T.A. "We have not seen that yet and we are going into this blind."
Gene Russianoff, the staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, said of tomorrow's M.T.A. board meeting. "I can only hope that this is a prelude to an actual discussion with the public."
He added that recent M.T.A. financial statements indicate that passenger revenues are ahead of expectations so far this year and that bus ridership has increased. "For an agency supposedly on the verge of a financial catastrophe," Mr. Russianoff said, "they sure look very good."
Neither Mr. Kalikow nor Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the M.T.A., returned calls yesterday seeking more information about the fare and service proposal.
State officials said that board members would probably not vote on the options tomorrow but that they could set in motion the process of hearings that must precede any fare increase or major service cuts.
Unlike previous discussions of fare increase, this one will not be a simple question of how much more to charge for a token. It will instead involve the complex give-and-take of MetroCard discounts, which could be changed to favor higher-income riders who pay for unlimited cards or to provide more help to those with smaller incomes who spend a little at a time.

HEADLINE: U.S. Urged to Test Solutions To a 'Crisis' in Health Care 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19 

 BODY:
The National Academy of Sciences said today that the United States health care system was in crisis and that the Bush administration should immediately test possible solutions, including universal insurance coverage and no-fault payment for medical malpractice, in a handful of states.
 Administration officials said the report would probably become a blueprint for pilot projects to be proposed by President Bush and Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, who requested the study. 
 "The American health care system is confronting a crisis," said the report, from a panel of experts appointed by the academy's Institute of Medicine. "The health care delivery system is incapable of meeting the present, let alone the future, needs of the American public." 
It cataloged the problems: "The cost of private health insurance is increasing at an annual rate in excess of 12 percent. Individuals are paying more out of pocket and receiving fewer benefits. One in seven Americans is uninsured, and the number of uninsured is on the rise." 
States, suffering severe fiscal problems, are cutting eligibility and benefits in Medicaid and other health programs, the panel said, and tens of thousands of people die from medical errors each year.
The tone recalled the urgency of President Bill Clinton, who in 1993 and 1994 asked Congress to guarantee health insurance for all Americans. In its report today, the panel proposed a more modest agenda, using states as laboratories to reverse "disturbing trends" that it said had worsened in the last two years.
The panel suggested that three to five states pursue affordable "coverage for all citizens and legal residents," by providing tax credits or expanding Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program.
"We learned in 1993 and 1994 that you cannot be prescriptive," said Gail Warden, president of the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, who was chairman of the panel that wrote the report. 
The 16-member panel proposed pilot projects in four other areas: medical malpractice, community health centers, treatment of chronic illnesses and information technology, to computerize medical records and reduce paperwork. The panel, which included doctors, lawyers, a nurse and several professors, did not estimate the costs of its proposals.
The panel acknowledged that health care was not a top priority in Washington at the moment, as officials worry about the economy, terrorism and the possibility of war in Iraq. But the panel predicted that health care would soon move back to the top of the nation's agenda.
Secretary Thompson welcomed the report. He could start some of the projects on his own next year. For others, he would need legal authority and money from Congress. 
Administration officials said they wanted to take bold steps next year to rebut Democratic assertions that Mr. Bush has neglected health care in his first two years in office. Many of Mr. Bush's usual allies, including the National Federation of Independent Business, have been pleading with the administration and Congress for help in getting health insurance at affordable prices.
The number of uninsured has been climbing for a decade and now stands at 41.2 million, or 14.5 percent of the population, the report said. In expanding coverage, the panel said, states should allow all members of a family to enroll in the same health plan, and each state with a demonstration project should set up an electronic clearinghouse to verify eligibility and to enroll state residents. 
The panel also said that four or five states should test alternatives to medical malpractice lawsuits as a way of compensating patients who contend they have been injured by doctors and hospitals. Patients who waive the right to a jury trial could receive "faster, fairer, surer compensation," the panel said.
"For the first time in nearly 20 years," the report said, "the United States is facing a broad-based crisis in the availability and affordability of malpractice liability insurance for physicians, hospitals and other health care providers." For some doctors, it said, liability insurance has become prohibitively expensive, and the market for such insurance has become extremely volatile.
Sally J. Greenberg, a lawyer at Consumers Union, said: "There's no credible evidence that pure tort reform, with strict caps on damages awarded by a jury, brings down medical malpractice rates. But a fair and equitable no-fault compensation system could conceivably be beneficial to patients."
Under the proposal, states could limit payments for pain and suffering and other noneconomic damages, and the federal government would subsidize insurance for health care providers who promptly compensate patients for "avoidable injuries." Alternatively, state agencies could adjudicate claims and decide the proper compensation, using a schedule of damages or other benchmarks.
The panel acknowledged that there might be constitutional problems in compelling consumers to accept these arrangements, but it said that patients might be allowed to opt out when they enroll in a health plan or enter a hospital.
Other pilot projects would try to create a "paperless health care system," through greater use of computers; beef up 40 of the nation's community health centers with sophisticated equipment; and test new methods of managing care for people with chronic conditions like diabetes, asthma and heart disease.
"The time for change has come," the panel concluded. "The country that put the first man on the moon and invented the microchip is surely capable of ensuring that children are immunized, that patients who suffer heart attacks receive life-saving drugs" and that smokers receive the counseling and assistance they need to quit.

IN COST-CUTTING MOVE,BANK OF AMERICA TO TRIM WORKERS

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 The Bank of America Corporation, plans to lay off 900 technology and operations workers by the end of the year to cut costs. 
The chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, is trying to reduce expenses by $1 billion a year. The company, based in Charlotte, N.C., expects the economy to remain weak next year, and "it is obvious that we can't meet our 2003 budget without affecting the personnel line," Tim Arnoult, technology and operations executive, said in a memo to employees on Monday. Bank of America has eliminated 9,689 jobs, or 6.7 percent of its work force, over the last year.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Internet: Britain To Provide More High-Speed Web Access 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 The British government said yesterday that it would spend more than $:1 billion ($1.6 billion) to provide high-speed Internet access to schools, hospitals, police departments and other public services. The government has plans to have all its services, from health care to universities, online by 2005, Prime Minister Tony Blair said in a speech to a technology meeting. 
The government's pledge to increase technology spending is good news for companies like the BT Group and I.B.M., analysts said. Providers of software and telecommunications services have been hit in the last year as businesses reined in budgets amid slowing economies. Mr. Blair said he failed to meet his 1997 pledge to make Britain "the best environment for e-commerce by 2002." Britain trails the United States in that regard, according to a report released yesterday by Booz Allen Hamilton.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Train Pakistanis To Help Bar Terrorist Funds 

BYLINE:  By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 19 

 BODY:
The United States will provide technical assistance and training to Pakistani customs and finance officials to choke off money for terrorist organizations, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill confirmed here today.
 At the same time, he pressed the Pakistani government to take further steps to block financing for suspected terrorist groups and to curb money laundering. 
 Preventing financing of terrorism dominated meetings he held here in the capital today with Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz and the chief of the Central Bank and other finance officials. American Treasury officials came away saying that they were confident Pakistan was moving on the issue and that it would be only the second country, after the United Arab Emirates, to receive such specific assistance in tracking funds used for terrorism. 
"It is important because of the presence of Al Qaeda here," a Treasury official said. "We need to know where the financing is coming from and go after it." There are also plans to extend technical assistance to help countries throughout the Persian Gulf region curb financing of suspected terrorist groups, the official said. 
Mr. O'Neill met today with President Pervez Musharraf, an American ally in the campaign against terrorism. Pakistan has cooperated with F.B.I. agents in searching for and arresting terrorism suspects and has outlawed and blocked the assets of many entities that are thought to be linked to terrorism. 
Treasury officials said they had seen very good cooperation from Pakistan. It has acted this year to block the assets of 185 of the 247 groups identified by the United States, involving millions of dollars, a Treasury official said. 
Yet the high level of militant activity in Pakistan means that people and organizations here remain a major target in the effort to prevent terrorism. American and Pakistani officials have identified 11 Pakistani-based groups thought to be involved in terrorist activities, and two-thirds of the organizations designated as having a terrorist link by the United States and the United Nations have a connection in Pakistan, according to the Treasury Department. The attacks that continue to plague Pakistan indicate the continued active presence of Al Qaeda in the country, American officials said. 
Charities have often been used as the way to transfer money to militant groups, officials say, and trading companies have also been used to launder and disburse money. 
But Pakistan still has no system to monitor the activities of foreign charities in Pakistan. Nor does the formal financial sector have the ability to spot and report suspicious movements of money to the government, according to the Treasury Department. 
Mr. O'Neill nevertheless praised Mr. Aziz's fiscal policy and his efforts to improve financial, banking and exchange systems in Pakistan and the Central Bank's efforts to educate banks in finding and confiscating dirty money. 
"There is a major effort under way, and particularly in Pakistan, to go after tainted money," Mr. O'Neill said. "I think Pakistan is doing a great job in this work, and it is very much appreciated." 
At a joint news conference with Mr. O'Neill, Mr. Aziz said the government had also started regulating exchange companies and the informal system of money transfers. He announced that he was forming a special intelligence unit within the Finance Ministry to coordinate the government agencies involved in efforts against money laundering. 
He said that in addition to Pakistan's support for the campaign to prevent terrorism, it was in Pakistan's own interests to curb unofficial payments. The Pakistani economy receives an enormous boost from remittances sent home from Pakistanis working abroad, which are expected to amount to $4 billion this year, he said. 
"So any global effort that puts more money into official channels -- in the banking system -- rather than unofficial channels, benefits the economy of Pakistan, benefits the people of Pakistan and that is why we are very supportive of this effort," Mr. Aziz said. 
Pakistan was also seeking assistance from the United States to upgrade customs procedures at Pakistan's main port, Karachi, to allow better screening of goods arriving and leaving the country. That would not only benefit security, but improve the movement of goods and trade revenues, he said.

HEADLINE: Prison Looms for French Farmer, an Anti-Globalization Gadfly 

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 19 

 BODY:
A star of anti-globalization has fallen.
 Jose Bove, the sheep farmer and convicted vandal whose mission is to save France from fast food and free trade, is to serve 14 months in prison after the country's highest court today threw out his appeal. 
 The media-savvy Mr. Bove, 49, protests against globalization at economic summit meetings and is sometimes likened to the French cartoon hero Asterix, leading defiant Gauls against today's Romans. He attracted worldwide attention three years ago when he led a group of French farmers in smashing windows in a McDonald's in Millau, near his home in southern France. 
Later that year, he attacked a field of genetically modified rice at a research station near the southern city of Montpellier. He was sentenced to six months in prison, and it was an appeal of that sentence that France's Supreme Court of Appeal in Paris rejected today.
As someone who supplies sheep's milk to makers of Roquefort cheese, he also has opposed American trade tariffs against French luxury foods and multinational corporations.
The court's decision means that Mr. Bove must also serve a separate eight-month sentence for a similar attack on gene-modified crops in France in 1998. He also faces a $7,600 fine. His fall actually began earlier this year when he served six weeks in jail for the McDonald's attack.
After the ruling today, Mr. Bove vowed to fight imprisonment by asking President Jacques Chirac for a presidential pardon. "Of course we cannot ask him to overturn the verdict, but he has the power to stop the sentence being applied," Mr. Bove said in a statement. 
Reached briefly by phone, Mr. Bove said he was surprised by the verdict. Asked whether he would go to jail, he replied: "We'll see. Now is the time for mobilization."
Genetically modified crops are common in the United States. But the French, like many other Europeans, remain suspicious of using the new genetic technology in agriculture. Last July, rejecting appeals from the United States, the European Parliament voted to put labels on all foods from European Union countries that contain even the smallest amount of a genetically modified substance.
The United States had argued that stricter labeling by the European Union would hurt competition, disrupt trade and alarm consumers unnecessarily. But opponents insist that genetically modified products could lead to the uncontrollable spread of modified genes and harm insects and humans. Opinion polls in Europe consistently show widespread public opposition to their use.
Still, France grows experimental genetically modified crops on about 100 sites under the supervision of the Farm Ministry.
Mr. Chirac is unlikely to intervene, although he praised Mr. Bove at the time of the attack on the Millau McDonald's. Mr. Chirac said that he too hated McDonald's food.
But standing in front of the law courts in Millau today after the decision, Mr. Bove, who is a farmers' union leader, portrayed his struggle as one of workers' rights, calling the sentence "a serious violation." 
Lawyers for Mr. Bove argued in court that fear of health risks from the crops constituted a "state of necessity" that allowed citizens to take the law into their own hands and destroy them. But the court sided with the state attorney, who argued that no "state of necessity" existed because there had been no imminent threat to Mr. Bove's health.

Talk in Capital Of Easing Taxes On Dividends

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
If tax reform depends on labels, then ending "double taxation" sounds like a winner. 
 Under current law, a company pays corporate income taxes on its profits, and receives no deduction for dividends it pays to shareholders. The shareholders then pay taxes at ordinary income-tax rates on the dividends they receive. 
 Companies have sometimes talked about ending this taxation of dividends, but there has been little lobbying on it. They tend to prefer specific proposals that would benefit them, rather than a generalized idea that would help their shareholders, and everyone else's. 
This year, though, there has been a flurry of interest in the subject because of comments that President Bush made in Waco, Tex., in August after hearing Charles Schwab, founder of the discount brokerage firm, push for the change. "That makes a lot of sense," the president said.
Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has also spoken of the benefits of ending double taxation, although he has not introduced such legislation.
Over the years, the taxation of dividends has had a number of effects, some of which could be viewed as perverse. It has encouraged companies to rely on borrowed money, because interest expenses can be deducted from profits. That can leave companies vulnerable to financial trouble if business turns down. A company that cannot make its interest and debt-repayment obligations will go broke, while one that cannot meet its dividend promises can cancel the dividend without legal consequences, although its stock price will inevitably suffer.
It has also encouraged some companies to pay little or no dividend, but to repurchase its stock in the market instead. Those repurchases are sometimes intended to pay capital to shareholders, and sometimes to offset the dilution of shares that would be caused by generous stock option plans for executives. The company does no better in terms of taxes than it would if it paid dividends, but the shareholders who get the money by selling stock receive it in the form of capital gains, subject to a lower tax rate.
If the idea of ending double taxation moves forward -- notwithstanding comments by Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill that the country needs "targeted" tax moves to spur economic growth -- there are a variety of methods to deal with the matter.
The simplest would be to make dividend payments tax-deductible to companies. Such a move would treat dividends the same as interest payments, thus removing the tax code's incentive for companies to go into debt. It would also put an end to Wall Street's endlessly creative efforts to make what essentially are dividends appear to be interest payments. But it would be very expensive, and it would appear to be a corporate tax break, rather than one that would benefit investors directly. 
Mr. Thomas, the Ways and Means chairman, in a recent interview on CNBC, seemed to indicate that he found that approach attractive. "What do you want to do, remove the tax on dividends for individuals or corporations?" he asked. "I would say if you focused on corporations, you're right." 
One objection to that approach is that many dividends go to owners who need not now pay tax, at least not immediately. William G. Gale of the Brookings Institution calculates that about half of such payments escape taxation. Pension funds and retirement plans like individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans do not face such taxes, although the money paid out by such plans, whether obtained from capital gains, interest or dividends, will be taxed when the payments are made, perhaps decades later. Dividends paid to charitable foundations escape taxation entirely.
A way to get around that problem would be to allow dividend recipients a tax credit based on the taxes paid by the company paying the dividend. Robert Willens, a tax and accounting analyst at Lehman Brothers, said that kind of tax credit would help ordinary equity holders in companies, but not those who were exempt from taxation anyway. It would be complicated, though, with effective tax rates on dividends varying from company to company and from year to year.
Until the tax reform act of 1986, individual investors did not have to pay taxes on the first $200 of dividends they received. For many small investors, that meant dividends were effectively tax-exempt.
Reinstating that, perhaps at a higher level to recognize inflation's effect, is one proposal that has floated around. Mr. Gale estimated that a $1,000 annual exclusion for dividend income would cost the Treasury $4 billion in 2003.
But there are downsides as well. Such a plan would aid only investors who owned stocks, or mutual funds that invested in stocks, in taxable accounts. Those whose holdings were in retirement or other tax-deferred accounts would not be helped. 
Another idea that has circulated would be to tax dividends at capital gains rates, which now top out at 20 percent for assets held for one year. That would seemingly end the tax preference for one type of profit from a stock investment, capital gains, over the other, dividends. Dividends are now taxed at ordinary-income rates, which range up to 38.6 percent this year and are to fall to 35 percent in 2006.
Nonetheless, many companies could still argue that some share repurchases offered advantages to investors over dividend payments. That is because all money paid in dividends would be subject to taxation at capital gains rates. But the same amount of money paid to investors in share repurchases would generate much less taxable income, because some portion of the money would be viewed as a return of capital. An investor who had paid $30 for a share and sold it to the company for $40 would have a $10 capital gain. But if the company paid $40 in dividends and they were taxed at capital gains rates, all $40 would be taxable, to the extent that the investor held his stock in taxable accounts.
One other area of investor relief Mr. Bush has spoken about positively is raising the maximum capital-loss deduction. An investor can use capital losses to offset capital gains, and if there is an excess of the losses, can now deduct up to $3,000 from ordinary income. Any remaining losses can be carried over, to generate $3,000 deductions in future years.
The House Ways and Means Committee early in October cleared a bill to raise that annual limit to $8,250. But the bill was never passed, and it is not clear if such a provision would be in a new tax bill next year.
Such a provision would meet at least some opposition on Wall Street out of fear that it would encourage the selling of stocks at a time when the markets are already shaky.
In the end, there is still a good chance that nothing will happen on the tax front to directly benefit investors. Advocates of various corporate tax breaks will argue that cuts aimed at encouraging certain kinds of business spending would increase corporate investment and economic growth, and some will focus on the reality that investors who own stocks in taxable accounts tend to be wealthier than most. Such taxpayers are less likely to spend their savings, and such cuts therefore have less stimulative effect.

PREY
By Michael Crichton
367 pages. HarperCollins. $26.95.

FOUR BLIND MICE
By James Patterson
387 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $27.95.
 James Patterson's "Four Blind Mice" has a scene at an airport where Detective Alex Cross notices somebody reading Jonathan Franzen. That's nice, but it's unduly modest. Thrillers by Mr. Patterson and Michael Crichton are what you'll spy in waiting rooms everywhere. 
 Each of these brand-name authors returns to his most viable franchise with "Four Blind Mice" and "Prey." While Mr. Patterson's latest nursery-rhymer is one of his better, less sadistic Cross mysteries, Mr. Crichton turns to scary science for another lesson in technology run amok. In this case it's not resurrected dinosaurs who rampage but groups of molecular entities with as many as 1025 parts apiece. Think of "Prey" as "Jurassic Particles."
"Prey," a tight techno-adventure shaped to fit the footprint of Mr. Crichton's biggest hits, begins with the spectacle of Jack Forman buying place mats while his high-powered wife, Julia, neglects the household. Julia works for Xymos Technology and is engaged in developing nanocomputers (which is one hot research field among novelists; it also figures in Michael Connelly's new "Chasing the Dime"). 
While Jack stays home near San Jose, Calif., Julia is off at the "fab complex," which is not a high-fashion playland. It's the fabrication plant in the desert where Xymos is manufacturing trouble.
There are three things we know about "Prey" from the get-go:
1) Jack will not be sitting around the house long. (He is an unemployed Silicon Valley expert in distributed parallel processing, or computer programs that "model biological processes by creating virtual agents inside the computer and then letting the agents interact to solve real-world problems." This will come in handy.)
2) Julia will pay for being nicer to swarms of rogue particles than she is to her own children.
3) Although the premise of "Prey" is that these particles supposedly have no memory capacity, there are certain collective behavior patterns that they definitely understand. They know it's time to go berserk in the story's third act, after its highly interesting lecture phase is over.
Because there has been a teeny little leak of research specimens into the atmosphere, Jack is summoned to the fab complex to troubleshoot. What he knows -- and what Mr. Crichton explains in clear and fascinating detail -- is the difference between artificial intelligence and artificial life. Jack's specialty is studying the latter by projecting the rogue behavior of known entities once they form groups. 
As Mr. Crichton puts it most colloquially: "Trying to program distributed intelligence is like telling a 5-year-old kid to go to his room and change his clothes. He may do that, but he is equally likely to do something else and never return."
Without giving away too much of "Prey" before it arrives in bookstores on Monday -- or before somebody turns it into a special-effects fiesta on screen -- here is some of what Jack has to say as the plot unfolds:
"So you have a runaway swarm."
"Acting autonomously."
"You think that swarm is capable of hiding?"
"There's more than one?"
"How can it learn? The agents have no memory."
"They have memory?"
"You mean these are new swarms since noon?"
"So what you're telling me is this swarm reproduces, is self-sustaining, learns from experience, has collective intelligence and can innovate to solve problems."
Well, yes. 
And for anyone who cares to see what can happen when nanotechnology, biotechnology and computer technology collide, Mr. Crichton has both a high-octane story and a serious warning.
Since Mr. Patterson is someone who writes "Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop" four times on the same page to simulate gunfire, his is a less sophisticated undertaking. He simply sends Alex Cross, the Washington, D.C., police detective of "Roses Are Red" and "Violets Are Blue" and so on, to investigate a string of murders. He comes to the defense of a friend's Army buddy who has been accused of killing three women. 
"He painted their chests and stomachs," says the district attorney prosecuting the case. "It is gruesome and twisted." Of course by the standards of Mr. Patterson's earlier books, this is not much worse than jaywalking.
Although the killers are identified early and have been given the catchy nickname Three Blind Mice for reasons best understood by Mr. Patterson's publisher, this latest story is not out either to sicken or insult its readers. With a trail of intrigue that involves the Army and has links to the Vietnam War, "Four Blind Mice" constructs a straightforward mystery investigation punctuated by scattered moments of suspense. The book's most chilling section has the three killers for hire (we do not know who is paying them or why) roaming the Appalachian Trail looking for prospective victims. There is also a moment of actual symbolism, when the sight of a commercial airliner is used to generate terrorist-related foreboding.
No one is likely to mistake Mr. Patterson for an artful stylist. (One killer can be found "leering eerily.") But he and Alex Cross make better than usual company this time, as "Four Blind Mice" includes various homey and romantic interludes, not to mention a smell-the-roses awareness of life's fragility. 
The principals stop to enjoy themselves. And so do the killers. But Mr. Patterson makes his bad guys cigar-smoking, cholesterol-happy carnivores whose memories of Vietnam loom large and whose taste in background music suggests "Apocalypse Now." 
Maybe that's not fun after all.

HEADLINE: ARTS IN AMERICA; 
A Literary Tour Guide Interpreting the City of Dreams

BYLINE:  By Marc Weingarten

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 20 

 BODY:
Like this city itself, the literary tradition of Los Angeles is seemingly largely misunderstood and unjustly maligned. It is Raymond Chandler and Charles Bukowski and countless screenplays both celebrated and unproduced, but it's also Bertolt Brecht, Charles Mingus and a host of less familiar, though equally vital, names. At least that was the organizing principle behind "Writing Los Angeles," the latest literary colossus from the Library of America. 
 Its subject matter ranges from this city's amorphous geography to its Googie coffee shop architecture, lifestyle trends and peculiar social rituals. The anthology's 91 selections by 77 writers -- a mix of fiction, poetry, essays, journalism and diary entries -- make a convincing claim for Los Angeles as a fertile source of regional writing. The book, which was published this fall, received more advance orders than any title in the Library of America's 20-year history, 13,000 copies out of a first printing of 25,000, and is selling mostly in Southern California and New York. The 880-page book, priced at $40, was on the Los Angeles Times's best-seller fiction list for one week in October. West Coast critics have been effusive. Los Angeles Magazine called "Writing Los Angeles" the "fullest picture of Los Angeles's impact on America ever put between two covers," while The Los Angeles Times praised the book's editor, David L. Ulin, for doing a "masterful job of choosing some of the more compelling efforts to evoke a city whose essence has proved maddeningly elusive." 
 Mr. Ulin is a freelance editor and writer who moved here from Manhattan 12 years ago. "When putting together a book like this, there's an enormous amount of freedom to see L.A. literature fresh, without having a lot of received expectations," he said. "Historically, it's been a very tough city to pin down. There's really no defining narrative." 
But there are some obvious signposts, mainly from the literature of urban dissipation that Los Angeles has inspired more than any other American city. In the 1930's, transplants like Nathanael West and Raymond Chandler perpetuated the defining myth of Los Angeles as a city whose heavenly climate and leisurely lifestyle masked a viper's nest of compromised moral values.
That stark contrast, which the social critic Mike Davis has called the sunshine/noir dialectic, has been a wellspring of material for this city's writers. West's dystopic Hollywood novel "The Day of the Locust" is perhaps the most famous of these anti-Los Angeles texts. Then there are Chandler's roguish crime stories; the Joan Didion essays "Fire Season" and "Los Angeles Notebook," which counterbalance this city's wary optimism with an undercurrent of impending doom; and the 1977 book "The Sexual Outlaw," John Rechy's unsparing look at the gay underground of Los Angeles. 
All of these works are included or excerpted in the anthology, but not all of the writers in "Writing Los Angeles" focus on this city's bleak underbelly; there is genuine boosterism as well. The real pulse of Los Angeles is revealed in this book's intimate personal stories.
In his 1996 memoir, "Holy Land," for instance, D. J. Waldie writes affectionately about Lakewood, Calif., his native city and one of the many anonymous tract-home developments that sprang up like desert wildflowers in the 1950's. Finding joy and beauty in the suburban prosaic, Mr. Waldie reveals the hidden history of the "other" Los Angeles that is often criticized as a blight on the Southern California landscape. 
Similarly, Mary Helen Ponce's tale of life in 50's-era San Fernando Valley, "Hoyt Street: Memories of a Chicana Childhood," reveals the chasm between the Hollywood myth machine and those Angelenos who never went anywhere near a movie set. 
During a panel discussion for "Writing Los Angeles" at the Los Angeles Central Library recently, Ms. Ponce, who was joined by Mr. Ulin and Mr. Waldie, recounted her life as a young translator of Roy Rogers and Hopalong Cassidy westerns for the Hispanic matrons in her Pacoima neighborhood.
"We were fascinated by Hollywood," Ms. Ponce said. "We all lived for the myths, but we were rooted in the valley. We were hicks who never had a sense of Los Angeles."
Modern Los Angeles was built on myth. Marketed in the 1920's as America's Mediterranean, an Edenic land of temperate weather and endless financial opportunities, this city filled up with exiles and fortune seekers who quickly discovered that the hype didn't square with reality. The influx of countless novelists and journalists seeking movie work in Hollywood in the 1920's and 30's led to the first accounts of Los Angeles as a city of rootless wanderers, eccentrics and hucksters. Los Angeles, wrote Aldous Huxley in a 1926 essay in the anthology titled "Los Angeles: A Rhapsody," was a "city of dreadful joy," where "thought is barred" and "conversation is unknown." 
Max Rudin, the publisher of the Library of America, said: "When the New York writers came to Hollywood, that's when writing about L.A. gets a national audience. That kind of thinking about L.A. in almost apocalyptic terms begins then." 
In his 1935 short story "Golden Land," William Faulkner, who loathed the time he spent writing movie scripts, described "white villas whose owners' names and faces and even voices were glib and familiar in back corners of the United States where those of Einstein and Rousseau and Aesculapius had never been sounded."
For those early writers, Los Angeles was a philistine's paradise, the great social experiment that failed miserably. That idea ran through much of the writing about Los Angeles before World War II. "L.A. was where manifest destiny hit the sea," Mr. Rudin said.
After the war ended, Los Angeles was inspiring a different scenario. With a booming economy driven by entertainment and aerospace, this city's sprawling suburbs and autocentric culture had set the tone for the way the rest of the country lived. An essay like Tom Wolfe's 1964 Esquire piece "The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby," which gives serious consideration to the 1960's-era efflorescence of Los Angeles youth and car fetishism, would have been anathema to the previous generation of writers.
By the 70's, writers began to treat the city more sympathetically, celebrating the very things that had been historically denigrated. In his 1973 essay "Autopia," the Dutch novelist Cees Nooteboom wrote that Los Angeles "mixes images of vulgarity and vitality" and "conveys the feeling that it stretches to all sides around you, but never looks down on you or presses you down, an open world that forms itself as a unity despite its fragmented appearance."
Los Angeles continues to be a rich mine of material for writers and a metaphor for the nation. "L.A. is about everything that's central to American culture: the car, the horizontal nature of urban space, fast-food, modern architecture," Mr. Rudin said. "It's the quintessential 20th-century American city."

HEADLINE: MAKING BOOKS; 
Poetry Hits The Jackpot

BYLINE:  By Martin Arnold

 BODY:
Financial bombshells in the book world usually mean huge best sellers and jumbo advances. But last week the big number was a bequest, and in a country coping with corporate scandal and economic affliction and about ready to march off to war, there was something marvelously innovatory, out-of-step almost, about someone investing what could be as much as $100 million in Poetry, the magazine, and in poetry, the art. Which is exactly what Ruth Lilly did, invest in poetry, a stunningly pure benevolence. One can but wonder what this will do for that most marginalized literary form. Visibility, for sure, since suddenly there's lots of 0000's at the end of the $$$$'s attached to the word poetry. 
 For the monthly Poetry, which celebrated its 90th anniversary this year, the money from the 87-year-old heir to the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical fortune insured its existence into perpetuity, an astonishing happening for an esoteric publication with a circulation (until today) of about 11,000. Certainly I think it's good for poets and poetry. But Poets are a quirky lot, and the first, but not lasting, reaction from some was concern, since this peripheral art's loneliness was seen as part of its strength; the next common reaction was that the idea of connecting money to poetry was somehow unpoetic. John Hollander, poet and Yale professor, questioned whether it would be a plus to publish thousands more poetry books. But it would be wonderful, he said, if some of the money could encourage better poetry criticism. 
 Alice Fulton, this year's winner of the $10,000 Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry for her book of poems "Felt" (W. W. Norton), explained: "I was almost scared when I heard about it. I had come to believe that marginalization let poetry do what it wants to do, that the money would take something good and make it bad. But that's being afraid of change. Giving this to literature is staggering; very few people care about poetry, and this will make it a positive thing to people, so it can be empowering to writers." 
Rita Dove, Pulitzer Prize-winning poet in 1987 and America's poet laureate from 1993 to 1995, said, "I think it's a myth that if one receives money for writing, it's corrupting." She added: "That's one of the myths literary people have consoled themselves with. That poetry is going to have money is a good thing. And I can't think of anyone more deserving of money than Poetry magazine, which has remained refreshingly honest over the years, hasn't gone for trends." Ms. Dove's latest collection was "On the Bus with Rosa Parks" (W. W. Norton, 1999).
Poetry magazine was first published in 1912, and since then to appear in it was to be part of a great literary continuum, which ranged from Yeats and Eliot and Sandburg and Stevens to Ms. Fulton and Ms. Dove and Billy Collins (but not Ms. Lilly, whose own poetry was rejected by the magazine). Mr. Collins, the current poet laureate, said that "raising the fee from $2 a line to $2,000 a line would be one poet's suggestion" for using the money. Mr. Collins was, of course, joking, although Joseph Parisi, the magazine's editor, said that fees to contributors will be increased somewhat. 
For starters, he wants to use the money to educate middle school and high school teachers in the richness of poetry. "If you have dollar signs in front of something, then people take an interest, can't seem to help but focus, but that's not the best way to get attention," he said. He envisions programs where teachers meet active poets "and ask them such questions as 'Where do their ideas come from?' and 'Why do you write?' The best way to spend money is with teachers in workshops."
He described it this way: "Make poetry a reality, something of pleasure and love, not dry-as-dust theory," the joy and passion to be passed on to students. The magazine, published by the Modern Poetry Association, also plans to publish first collections of poetry -- "We get to see everything, and we get a pretty good idea of who will be the new important poets," Mr. Parisi said. The association has a collection of about 25,000 first editions of poetry stashed away that it now wants to catalog and display for scholars.
But for now the magazine and the association -- and the community of poets -- are simply trying to cope with the immensity of it all. Deborah Cummins, president of the association and a published poet, said, "For most people poetry belongs in another sphere, and if significance is measured by the dollar sign, as many believe, then the underlining message of all this is that maybe poetry has an importance we didn't know about." 
Poets speak. From Lisel Mueller, 1997 Pulitzer Prize winner in poetry for "Alive Together" (Louisiana State University Press): "Poetry is always a minority art, as is chamber music a minority music, and I don't think this will affect the reading public; I don't know if this will have any general effect on poetry in general, but it will allow the magazine to do more outreach programs, and that will obviously be a shot in the arm."
John Ashbery, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award and National Book Critics Circle Award, all in 1975, said he didn't "think all that money was going to turn America into a country of passionate poetry readers." He added, "That she did it after having her own poetry rejected is almost the most interesting thing about it." Mr. Ashbery's latest collection is "Chinese Whispers" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux).
For all that poets feel they are seldom read, there are mainstream houses that have strong poetry programs like Farrar, Straus & Giroux, Alfred A. Knopf, Norton and Houghton Mifflin. The belief that money attached to anything is like flypaper in its attraction extends even to something as way out as poetry.
Carol Houck Smith, who is a poetry editor at Norton, said that when it comes to poetry "so many say, 'Oh, I can't read that,' but certainly more people are writing poetry, and the announcement will make people less anxious about poetry, and that's wonderful."
Jill Bialosky, a Norton poetry editor and Knopf poet, said the bequest "will bring more media attention and more review attention to poetry and help create a larger readership." And Deborah Garrison, poetry editor at Knopf, also said she believes that the money "is a boon for everybody who writes poetry," and addedthat when "poetry is in front of people, they love it."
All this may be true. But if Mr. Parisi and his people could use money to get everyone who, in their loneliness and passion, secretly scribbles verse to buy a book of poetry that would truly revolutionize the art.

HEADLINE: DESIGN NOTEBOOK; 
From the Bottomlands, Soulful Stitches

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: GEE'S BEND, Ala. 

 BODY:
AT this time of year, when the shadows grow long and pecans fall heavy on the red earth, the memories of old women in this loop of land encircled by the Alabama River turn to quilting.
 For it was in autumn, after the cotton crop was brought in, that the granddaughters and great-granddaughters of slaves on this former plantation land would whip cotton with plum-tree switches and then gather together to "put a quilt up." 
 "We'd get together and make the quilts just like we're praying together," recalled Mary Lee Bendolph, 67, one of 45 Gee's Bend quilt makers whose work goes on view today at the Whitney Museum of American Art. The quilts' journey from Gee's Bend to New York is yet another chapter, as yet unfinished, in the community's long and often difficult story. Ms. Bendolph was sitting on her front porch one recent afternoon beside a worn copy of the Bible. "We had no TV, no radio, no nothing. That's the way we learned -- sitting watching our mamas piecing the quilt. When the sun came down you be in the house together, laughing and talking. We were more blessed then." 
The bittersweet history of a place where isolation and poverty still reside is stitched into the trouser legs, cornmeal sacks, dress skirts and Sears corduroy swatches that constitute one of the country's most unbroken and deeply imaginative quilting traditions. When Early Pettway, 73, surveys the hand-painted headstones in the cemetery beside the Pleasant Grove Baptist Church, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. preached in 1965, he remembers generations of women, many his own relatives, and their jubilant stitchery airing on wire fences in the sun. "Way back yonder," he said, "everybody here but the men quilted." 
The artistic legacy of African-American women in this hamlet of 300 families, where 42 percent of the residents earn less than $10,000 a year, springs from a deep and powerful well. As a little girl, Arlonzia Pettway, 79, an accomplished quilt maker and Mr. Pettway's sister, would sit with her siblings and baby cousins on her great-grandmother's string quilt every day after the noontime dinner. Grandmama Dinah Miller, a slave who died at age 102 in the 1930's, would lay down the quilt, the single material legacy of her mother, on the gaping floorboards as protection from the wind, cold and dust. Then the stories unfolded: of slave ships cruelly decorated with red ribbons to lure people on board; of Grandmama Dinah Miller's baby boy who was fathered by a white man and then taken away; of the terrifying click-clicking sound the horses' teeth made when the slave masters came. "I'd wake up at night and think of the stories she told," Mrs. Pettway said. "I didn't forget them. I pawned them in my heart."
Despite countless forays by sociologists, photographers and writers from the 1930's onward, Gee's Bend's isolation served to preserve an idiosyncratic style of quilt making that is as direct and unvarnished as the landscape itself. "What makes Gee's Bend distinct is the freedom with which the women approach their art," said John Beardsley, a senior lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Design and a co-curator of the exhibition at the Whitney. "Many African-American quilts in the South emphasize recycled materials and abstract patterns. What's unusual in Gee's Bend is the density of accomplishment."
Alvia Wardlaw, a curator at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, where the show originated this fall, likens the avant-garde look of Gee's Bend quilts to the improvisational quality of jazz. "There is the same self-assuredness and freedom, a lack of hesitancy about who they are as people," she said. "The quilts reflect the bold rhythms of a life of doing, the flurry of activity, where being at home was the center of the universe and the bed a place to exhibit creativity." 
The 70 quilts in the exhibition, over half by living artists, are among roughly 530 Gee's Bend quilts amassed over the last five years by William Arnett, a controversial Atlanta collector and passionate documentarian of vernacular African-American folk art, whose relationship with some artists he has championed has led in the past to accusations of exploitation. 
As a pre-emptive strike, perhaps, Mr. Arnett has created a nonprofit foundation, the Tinwood Alliance, to own and conserve the quilts -- for which he said he paid an average of $275 each -- and to sell an as yet unknown number to museums, including the Art Institute of Chicago, which is in the process of buying as many as five. He says he plans to funnel any profits into the community, though he has not said how that would work. "I paid them three or four times the going rate," he said. "But these quilts may be worth a hundred times that one day." 
His supporting cast includes Jane Fonda, recently attracted to Southern African-American art, who has given $1 million to Tinwood Media, an Atlanta publishing company Mr. Arnett created to produce lavish and comprehensive books on rural African-American artists, including two hefty new volumes: "The Quilts of Gee's Bend" ($45.50) and "Gee's Bend: The Women and Their Quilts" ($75). The company has also produced a documentary film on the quilt makers by Mr. Arnett's son, Matt, and Vanessa Vadim, Ms. Fonda's daughter. The film will be shown at the Whitney show.
Among the most striking quilts are those made by Loretta Pettway, which are neighborhoods of emotion rendered in material form. She exploits every nuance of denim, fashioning strong abstract collages from the barest scraps. "I didn't have a good scissor," she recalled, enveloped by warmth from a gas fire in her living room. "I mostly had to rip them loose. I just fit them the way they were cut. The Lord built in me how to fit them. Because I needed them."
Like many people here, Mrs. Pettway, the mother of seven, barely gets by, living, she estimates, on about $5,000 a year. The art world may herald her "austere masterpieces," as one museum curator put it, but she romanticizes the quilts not a wit. They were hard work, akin to chopping wood, hauling water and making laundry starch from scratch out of boiling water, flour and "a little kerosene to make the clothes slip." 
"I never had no time to myself," she said.
Sometimes the walls of her childhood home inspired her. "We didn't have no sheet rock," she said. "We nailed torn boxes to the wall and then plastered them with newspapers and catalogs. I saw some quilts in those papers and liked how they were made. I couldn't make no pretty quilts, but it did me good to look at them." 
Her last name, shared by many Gee's Benders, was assigned by Mark Pettway, a plantation owner who in the 1840's moved his family and more than 100 slaves from North Carolina to Gee's Bend, forcing all but his family and a cook to make the journey on foot. During the Depression, the widow of a merchant in nearby Camden who had been advancing credit to tenant farmers in the Bend foreclosed on their debts and ordered a raid, driving the community into complete destitution.
"We went through some rough times," said Annie Mae Young, in whose hands strips of denim and corduroy assume the eloquence of a flag. "You couldn't get the money to piece quilts with. You needed fire to keep warm. You can't quilt cold."
Spurred by documentary photographs, the federal government stepped in in the 1930's and made Gee's Bend a model of the New Deal, reimagining the town and replacing skinned-pine log houses chinked with clay with "Roosevelt houses," as they are still called, equipped with leakless roofs, cast-iron stoves and other improvements. The program created a rarity: a whole community of independent African-American landowners in the impoverished rural South. For years, the Bend's connection to the "mainland" was a ferry to the far side of the river and the predominantly white county seat of Camden. During the civil rights movement, many quilt makers here, along with their families, began to cross the river to register to vote, resulting in the abrupt termination of ferry service in 1965. Service has never been restored to Gee's Bend. The closest hospital, high school and police station require a 45-mile drive. 
The civil rights movement led in 1966 to the creation of the Freedom Quilting Bee, organized by Francis X. Walter, an Episcopal priest who was in Alabama documenting civil rights abuses. He seized upon quilts as a vehicle for economic empowerment and helped local women set up a cooperative, leading to highly publicized auctions in New York. The first check from New York, $2,065 for more than 70 quilts, went to necessities like washing machines, indoor plumbing and, in at least one instance, college tuition for the great-granddaughter of a slave.
For a fleeting moment in the 1970's, the Quilting Bee's work, made in Rehoboth, just up the road, was promoted at Bloomingdale's, in Diana Vreeland's Vogue and by the decorator Sister Parish, who outfitted the summer house of William S. Paley, the chairman of CBS, with orange and yellow fabric stitched at the Bee.
"The Bee was the first business black people in Wilcox County owned," said Nettie Young, 85, an original Bee leader who learned to quilt at age 7. "It was the first time I knew I was special, the first job I had, excusing cotton picking." 
The Bee, which is now struggling to survive, eventually went commercial, diluting the Bend women's singular designs to produce eyeglass cases, crewel-work TV Guide covers, conference tote bags and other less than distinctive products. But many quilt makers here would like to see the Bee, which is currently reorganizing its board, return with the kind of quilts now hanging in the Whitney. 
That so many Benders, including the quilt makers, were willing to part with their creations reflects the complex texture of a place where chickens and cows share the road and generations of families are often clustered in a phalanx of weatherworn houses and mobile homes. Created as objects of utility, the "raggly" or bedraggled antique quilts, squirreled away under mattresses and in chicken coops and wood piles, were often used to mop up motor oil, cover up cars from the rain and even, as Arlonzia Pettway herself did, "lit on a big old wood pile and burnt." 
But hindsight can be a hard teacher, especially when illuminated by museum spotlights. At the moment the town is divided between those who feel fairly compensated for their quilts and those who now consider them "a gold strike" for the buyers, in the words of the Rev. Clinton J. Pettway Jr., pastor of Ye Shall Know the Truth Church. 
"We didn't know these quilts would have value, like Babe Ruth cards," he said. His mother sold some quilts to the Arnetts, which he regrets. "When I first heard about selling quilts I was against it," he said. "But at the time people needed the money. It was like telling someone not to eat when food was in front of them."
Mr. Arnett, who said he borrowed $1 million to purchase, conserve and research the quilts, said one goal might be to help get the Freedom Quilting Bee going again, possibly with a quilting museum inside. Nowadays, in a Wal-Mart culture, there is less time and motivation for younger women to make quilts. A potential model could be Mississippi Cultural Crossroads in Port Gibson, Miss., which has gotten grant money to foster quilting through apprenticeships.
For Annie Mae Young and Arlonzia Pettway, who had given up their art because of old age and arthritis, the sight of their joyous creations being celebrated in books and art museums has inspired them to begin quilting again. It has made Essie Bendolph Pettway, 46, who works long hours in a sewing factory in Selma, to renew her commitment to the art she hones deep into the wee hours of morning "just to see how that quilt turns out."
Nettie Young, who has made quilts to commemorate each of her 22 grandchildren's high school graduations, has recently started to teach her 29-year-old granddaughter, Carolyn Pounds, how to quilt. Like the strips and pieces of work clothes and old dresses in a quilt, she sees the past and present coming together. 
"Quilting is the whole history of my family," she said, sitting with three generations beside her on a velveteen sofa. "I learned this year that what my foreparents did is recognized today to be art, not just cover. But it was always special to me."

HEADLINE: Home Building Fell Sharply in October 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 

 BODY:
Housing starts dropped sharply in October, falling 11.4 percent, the Commerce Department reported today. Economists said the decline was probably weather related. 
 Groundbreaking for new homes showed the biggest monthly drop since January 1994 and erased a big gain in September, the agency said. 
 The pace of starts was the slowest since April, but economists said it remained relatively high, and they cited heavy rain in October as a potential factor for the decline. 
"Looking at what we have from the weather bureau for October, virtually all the regions in the country, except for the west region, were unusually wet," said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. 
The West was the only region of the country to record a gain in the number of starts in October. 
Over all, groundbreaking for new homes slid to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.603 million units last month from a downwardly revised 1.810 million in September.
While housing starts fell, building permits, an indication of builder confidence, rose 1.7 percent, to 1.763 million units. Economists said the rise in permits and a climb in mortgage applications signaled stamina in the housing sector . 
Despite the drop in October, economists said the fundamentals for the housing sector were good. 
"There is little doubt that the fundamentals for the housing sector are extremely favorable," said Kevin Cummings of RBS Greenwich Capital. "Mortgage rates are at their lowest level in almost 40 years, demographics are positive, resulting in part from high levels of immigration, and people have a new-found appreciation for the wisdom of investing in real estate in the wake of the stock market plunge." 
Housing starts had posted their biggest gain in seven years in September as buyers seized on low mortgage interest rates to snap up homes in large numbers. The October rate was still 4.7 percent higher than the 1.531 million level in October last year. 
Ian Morris, chief economist at HSBC Securities, said that "1.6 million units is still a high level." 
Single-family housing starts, the biggest category of building, slid 7.0 percent in October, to a 1.350 million unit annual rate. Multifamily housing starts tumbled 31.4 percent to their lowest level since January 1997. 
Starts fell 18.8 percent in the Northeast, 14.3 percent in the South and 19.5 percent in the Midwest. They rose 3.6 percent in the West.

HEADLINE: States of Pain 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Watching the fiscal crises gripping cities and states across the U.S. is like watching a chain-reaction auto wreck in slow motion. I don't think the general public has a good sense yet of the pain that will result from the carnage.
 California residents learned last week that their state, already laboring under a huge budget gap in the current fiscal year, will face a potentially catastrophic shortfall next year -- $21 billion, which is far higher than almost anyone expected. 
 In New York, state officials will have to close an estimated $10 billion gap next year. This comes as New York City is appealing for help from the state in closing a municipal budget deficit that already has the mayor -- a Republican businessman -- calling for a couple of billion dollars in service cuts and more than $4 billion in new taxes. 
At some point the ability of cities and states to deliver even essential services begins to come into question. 
"It's not a pretty picture," said Arturo Perez of the National Conference of State Legislatures, when I asked him to describe, in general terms, the fiscal conditions confronting the states. He said very serious budget gaps had emerged in the fiscal year that began July 1, 2001.
"For the most part the size and the number were unexpected," he said. "But then again, who could have predicted the events of Sept. 11? And, of course, we were already in a decline at that point, so Sept. 11 was sort of the push down the stairs that we did not need."
State officials did what they could to close the initial gaps without big tax increases or drastic service cuts. Some resorted to one-time measures, such as tapping reserve funds, while hoping for a turnaround in the national economy that would replenish faltering state tax revenues. 
"Go back to January and February," said Mr. Perez, "and look at what national economists were saying about where we would be in mid-2002. They forecast a rebound, gradual growth in the economy by mid-year. Well, June, July and August came and went and nothing happened." 
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities:
"States now face a gigantic revenue problem. Total state tax revenue in fiscal year 2002 was some $38 billion lower than in the previous year after adjusting for inflation. Some 45 states lost revenue. Official forecasts released to date suggest that state revenues at best will hold steady after adjusting for inflation in fiscal year 2003, meaning that none of that $38 billion is likely to be recouped this year. Indeed the revenue hole could get even deeper."
While the national economy remains stagnant, some state budget obligations continue to grow. And during the boom years of the mid- to late 90's, many states enacted permanent tax cuts that shut off revenue streams that are desperately needed now. 
The states are in a fix and no one at the moment sees a way out. Big-time tax increases and painful service cuts are inevitable in some places. In others, the resistance to tax increases is so extreme it is difficult to imagine how a reasonable budget solution can be crafted.
In California, for example, the brutal fiscal situation has not weakened the opposition of Republican legislative leaders to tax increases. Just a few days ago The Los Angeles Times quoted the Senate Republican leader, Jim Brulte, as saying, "I don't see any Republican votes" for higher taxes.
On Election Day in Massachusetts, which will face an estimated $2 billion deficit next year, voters moved perilously close to a tax revolt that was breathtaking in its mindlessness. Nearly half the voters -- 45 percent -- supported a ballot proposal to eliminate the state income tax, a move that would have plunged the state into a fiscal emergency. 
Democratic and Republican leaders, including the gubernatorial candidates of both parties, opposed the ballot measure. It was pushed by the Libertarian Party, and when the votes were tabulated even supporters of the measure were surprised by how well it did. 
There are those who have long dreamed of the day when governments would be so drained of revenues they would have no choice but to call a halt to many of their functions. The realization of that dream is getting closer, in part because its tragic implications remain obscure to vast segments of the public served by those governments.

HEADLINE: Security Chief Hopes to Curb Airport Lines 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 

 BODY:
The chief of the Transportation Security Administration said today that airport security personnel would make common-sense judgments to avoid creating "multihour lines" at Thanksgiving and Christmas.
 The official, James M. Loy, under secretary of transportation for security, also said that with aviation security preparations beginning to fall into place, he would soon turn more attention to other modes of travel. 
 Mr. Loy said he was committed to strong security but also to preventing that security from creating problems for travelers and damaging the American economy. "It doesn't take much of a viewer, an observer," he said, "to recognize that it was the economic dislocation as a result of things that occurred on Sept. 11" that penalized the country in the aftermath of the attacks that day. 
Speaking with reporters at a breakfast sponsored by the Aviation Safety Alliance, an advocacy organization of the airlines, aircraft manufacturers and related industries, Mr. Loy said that when he met with screeners, as he does regularly, he told them "to remember the pleases and thank yous." Screeners can make travel a pleasant experience rather than a nightmare, he said, and "I want those people to be encouraging those experiences, so people aren't opting for a train to New York as opposed to the Delta shuttle." 
Thanksgiving always produces long lines at airports. The Transportation Security Administration's routine goal is to take no more than 10 minutes to screen a passenger, but officials of the agency say the counting begins only when the passenger reaches the head of the line and enters the actual screening process.
Lines have become shorter, though, with the hiring of new screeners and the opening of new lanes. In fact, some travelers have observed that between peak periods, screeners have little to do.
"If I want to err in this security business," Mr. Loy said, "I want to err on the side of producing too much initially, and pare it back." 
A bigger challenge may come on Dec. 31, the effective date of new requirements that checked bags be screened for bombs. But the domestic security bill just passed by Congress gives Mr. Loy the authority to grant his agency exemptions, airport by airport, for up to a year. An earlier version of the bill would have limited the exemptions to 40 airports; Mr. Loy said he would keep that number in mind, although the bill as passed has no limit.
Mr. Loy said that while most of the security deadlines set by Congress concerned passengers and bags, "we can't lose sight of perimeter security" at airports. And, he said, security at seaports and other transportation points also requires attention.
Mr. Loy said he spent the first 45 minutes of each day listening to an intelligence briefing. "The threat that the president constantly reminds us of," he said, "is a very, very real thing."

HEADLINE: Industries Welcome U.S. Aid on Terror Insurance 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Deborah Beck sighed with relief yesterday.
 For 14 months Ms. Beck, executive vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York, a powerful trade group, had been spearheading a campaign on behalf of the great buildings of New York -- places like the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building -- as well as scores of huge but less-distinguished buildings. The buildings' owners and lenders all wanted terrorism insurance, she said, but they could not get enough -- or, in some cases, any at all. 
 Late Tuesday night, however, the Senate answered her prayers by passing legislation, which, once signed by President Bush, will put Washington in the terrorism insurance business and make it likely that such coverage will be available.
Without the backing of the government -- which in the event of a major attack will pay most of the losses under policies provided by private insurers -- most insurers have been unwilling to sell terrorism coverage.
Of course, construction projects and big property deals that have stalled for want of the insurance did not suddenly begin to percolate on news of the breakthrough, Ms. Beck said. But, gradually, she and others said, as new policies are written, deals will start going through and the economy will pick up. "It's not going to happen overnight," Ms. Beck said. "But now it will be sooner rather than later."
David W. Liddle, a spokesman for the Financial Services Round Table, a group of the country's largest banks, insurance companies, investment banks and brokerage firms, said, "The impact immediately is to restore some certainty to the markets."
There was also an immediate impact, and some furious activity, at insurance companies across the country yesterday, as they reviewed policies and tried to figure out just what to charge for the new coverage. They were also busy fielding calls from brokers, who were fielding calls from their corporate clients.
But nobody had much in the way of answers. "How everything will happen, we don't know yet," said Bruce D. Guthart, president of United States operations for Hub International, an insurance brokerage firm with offices in Manhattan. 
In Washington, officials at the Treasury Department began meticulously taking apart the legislation, which they will be charged with carrying out. And since insurance is regulated state by state, with no federal oversight, the Treasury officials are starting from scratch. "We need to learn a lot about the insurance business," an administration official said.
One early phone call was to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the organization of state insurance regulators, to signal cooperation rather than competition.
The legislation provides for the federal government to pay for 90 percent of all losses of more than $10 billion in the first year of the three-year program. For losses of less than $10 billion, insurers, initially, will be required to pay up to 7 percent of the premiums they collect. In the third year, the government is to take on 90 percent of the costs above $15 billion; for less costly attacks, the insurers will have to pay up to 15 percent of their premiums.
An important issue not spelled out in the legislation is price. The days of free terrorism coverage, which had been included in commercial policies, ended with the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon last year.
And terrorism coverage, at least at first, is expected to remain expensive, even with the government's backing. But Ms. Beck, insurance brokers and rating agencies said that as more insurers offer the coverage, the price should fall.
Though terrorism coverage is clearly an added cost that businesses would prefer to avoid, they will be under increasing pressure to buy it as it becomes widely available.
Some pressure is already coming from the agencies that rate bonds that finance big buildings and construction projects. In September, Moody's Investors Service lowered the credit ratings on loans on some prominent buildings in New York, including the Rockefeller Center complex and two towers in Times Square, which it said had inadequate terrorism coverage -- moves that increased their borrowing costs.
Tad Philipp, a managing director of Moody's, said that with the new provisions for terrorism coverage, the agency did not expect to be cutting the ratings on loans on other buildings soon. 
For the buildings already downgraded, he said: "Passing a bill does not necessarily mean that a borrower is going to order the appropriate insurance. We want to see the insurance policies in our hands before taking further action."
Some insurance experts were surprised to discover that the legislation applies exclusively to terrorism committed by foreign groups or nations. Attacks by Americans, like the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, will not be covered.
Some experts were also concerned that the legislation left many details to be worked out by the government administrators. "It's a good blueprint," said Bruce S. Zaccanti, a senior insurance specialist at Ernst & Young, "but it doesn't spell out all the fine points."
During the legislation's long gestation, there was much debate over how badly the economy was being hurt by the lack of terrorism insurance. President Bush and other backers said billions of dollars worth of projects had been affected, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without work. Critics said the lack of terrorism insurance was just one of many things hurting the economy.

HEADLINE: L.I. Rental Shortage Is Linked To Labor Needs, Report Says 

BYLINE:  By ELISSA GOOTMAN 

DATELINE: MANHASSET, N.Y. Nov. 20 

 BODY:
Of all the counties in the New York metropolitan area, Nassau and Suffolk have the lowest proportion of rental homes within their total housing, according to a study released today. 
 The lack of rental housing coupled with soaring housing prices poses a serious threat to the Long Island economy, which needs low- and moderate-income workers who can afford to live here, said Dr. Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist at the Long Island Association, a group of business, labor and civic leaders. Dr. Kamer, who conducted the study for the Long Island Housing Partnership, a nonprofit group, said the study was based on figures from the 2000 census. 
 "Unless Long Island can immediately expand its stock of homes that young workers can afford," Dr. Kamer said, "it will not be able to generate the labor supply needed by Long Island's expanding businesses." 
Dr. Kamer's remarks were made at a news conference at North Shore University Hospital here, a site selected because health care workers -- nurses, mental health counselors and pharmacy technicians, for example -- are among those who earn too little to live on Long Island. 
That Long Island housing prices are beyond the reach of many people comes as no surprise. In April, for instance, a newly organized coalition called the Long Island Campaign for Affordable Rental Housing held a news conference in which one man, a union organizer, described how he moved to the Poconos region of Pennsylvania and endured a three-hour trip each way after his family was forced to leave the Long Island house they had rented. 
Dr. Kamer said she was surprised to find that in 26 percent of the households on Long Island -- 227,000 residences -- families spend at least 35 percent of monthly household income on rent or ownership costs including mortgage payments. The 35 percent figure was used because it is slightly higher than the housing industry and the federal government's benchmark, which suggests people spend no more than 30 percent of their income on housing. 
"We had thought the number of unaffordable units on Long Island was anywhere from 50,000 to 90,000," Dr. Kamer said. "Certainly the 227,000 figure was an eye-opener." 
By now, she estimated, with housing costs rising about 20 percent a year in each of the past two years, that figure is probably closer to 250,000. The study, which was paid for by the Roslyn Savings Foundation, also found that roughly 30 percent of those who rent houses or apartments on Long Island spend at least half their monthly income on rent. But the ratio of renters to owners -- a figure that does not take into account illegal accessory apartments and situations in which adult children return home to live with their parents -- is relatively low. 
In Nassau County, 19 percent of the housing stock is rental housing. In Suffolk, that figure is 18 percent. To the extent that these figures include not only year-round but also seasonal rentals in spots like the Hamptons, the figures could overstate the actual rental housing pool. 
In Westchester County, by contrast, 38 percent of houses and apartments are rented, according to Dr. Kamer's analysis of census figures; in Rockland County, 27 percent of homes are rented and in Fairfield County, 29 percent of the housing stock is rental housing.
Nationally, about a third of the housing stock is rental housing, said Cushing N. Dolbeare, a housing policy consultant who founded and is chairwoman emeritus of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a nonprofit group based in Washington. 
Ms. Dolbeare, who had not seen Dr. Kamer's study, said of the shortage of homes that working families can afford: "It's appalling over all, and it's probably worse in Long Island than a lot of other places." 
To address the problem, Jim Morgo, president of the Long Island Housing Partnership, proposed things like changing zoning laws to make it easier for homeowners to create accessory apartments and ensuring that a percentage of land the government sells would go to build less expensive housing. 
Long Island's lack of rental and legal multiple-family housing stretches back to its roots. "We have always been a suburb with one-family houses," Dr. Kamer said. "We've tried to preserve that, but we could be condemning the Long Island economy to a decade of subpar economic growth if we fail to generate the workers needed by our businesses. And we will not generate those workers unless we can give them housing that they can afford."

HEADLINE: Fallout Spreads After Collapse Of a Health Services Lender 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL ONEAL 

 BODY:
The collapse of National Century Financial Enterprises toppled another of its clients yesterday when Doctors Community Healthcare -- a company based in Scottsdale, Ariz., that owns five hospitals in low-income neighborhoods in Washington, D.C.; Chicago and Southern California -- filed for Chapter 11 in the Federal Bankruptcy Court for the District of Columbia. 
 Doctors Community joins several other major customers of National Century that have filed for bankruptcy since the health care finance company, based in Dublin, Ohio, began to come apart in late October. The PhyAmerica Physician Group in Durham, N.C.; Tender Loving Care, a unit of Med Diversified in Andover, Mass.; LifeCare Solutions in San Diego; and Lincoln Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles have all sought Chapter 11 protection in the last two weeks after they stopped receiving payments from National Century. 
 Hundreds of other National Century clients are also scrambling to find alternative financing. Those that operate hospitals in depressed communities may be the hardest hit. 
"This is a knife in the heart for those institutions," said Rick Wade, a spokesman for the American Hospital Association. With rising costs, slow-paying insurers and lots of uninsured patients, many hospitals in low-income neighborhoods "are on the edge," he added. 
National Century itself filed for bankruptcy on Monday and has become the target of both an F.B.I. investigation and allegations of gross mismanagement brought by its clients and holders of $3.35 billion worth of its asset-backed securities.
The company's former chairman and chief executive, Lance K. Poulsen, resigned both posts under pressure on Nov. 8. 
The Doctors Community filing will provide protection from creditors to all five of its hospitals: Greater Southeast Community Hospital and Hadley Memorial Hospital in Washington; Michael Reese Medical Center in Chicago; Pine Grove Hospital in Canoga Park, Calif.; and Pacifica of the Valley Hospital in Sun Valley, Calif. The company issued a statement promising that wages and benefits would continue to be paid as the privately held company restructures. 
But the troubles of Doctors Community have already affected medical services in one of Washington's poorest neighborhoods. Karen Dale, chief executive of Greater Southeast Community Hospital, said that while she was confident the quality of care had not been affected at her hospital, the number of patients it can care for has diminished because of the severe cash squeeze. 
Two of the four companies that had been supplying nurses to Greater Southeast have withdrawn their employees because they were not being paid. The other two have reduced the number of nurses they will supply, Ms. Dale said. That means the hospital can accept fewer patients, especially in its intensive and critical care units. When its emergency room got too crowded over the weekend, for instance, Ms. Dale said the hospital was forced to divert ambulances to other hospitals. 
Meanwhile, Ms. Dale is spending much of her time trying to persuade her doctors and nurses to stay put. "The danger would be that the staff panics and decides to leave," Ms. Dale said. "We are located in Ward 8 -- the area with the worst health indices and a lot of poor people. This is devastating." Greater Southeast was the lead hospital in a highly publicized effort to privatize the District of Columbia's health care system for indigents in 2001. 
The troubles at Doctors Community began in late October when National Century, one of the largest health care finance companies in the country and the primary source of financing for most of its clients, began to fall apart. National Century lent money to cash-short health care companies in return for taking over rights to their receivables -- payments expected from insurers and government programs like Medicare and Medicaid. It then packaged those receivables into collateral for bonds and sold the bonds to investors, who received interest derived from the insurance payments. National Century gets a part of each transaction. 
But last spring, after Fitch Ratings downgraded the bonds, investors started to shy away from National Century, depriving it of new capital. In response, the company took money from reserve accounts backing two bond trusts worth $3.35 billion. When investors discovered that almost $350 million was missing from a trust called NPF XII, it was clear National Century was facing a liquidity crisis. The company stopped making payments to hundreds of hospital and home health care clients and the value of its bonds collapsed.
Since then, a bondholder group has charged in the Franklin County Court of Pleas in Columbus, Ohio, that National Century owned large stakes in many of its biggest clients -- companies like Med Diversified and Doctors Community. Other documents in the Ohio court proceedings claim that the company was lending far more money to these clients than they generated in receivables. Instead, court papers say, National Century was taking real estate and even artwork as collateral for the loans, violating the bond indenture. 
In effect, bondholders have charged, National Century was using its AAA-rated bonds to prop up distressed companies in which it had a direct ownership interest. Bank One, the trustee for a portion of National Century's bonds, said in a court filing that "the evidence of systematic financial trickery continues to mount."
Some of the bondholders are moving on. The Ambac Financial Group announced on Monday that it would write down 70 percent of its $174 million investment in the bonds. Others with big exposure include the Pacific Investment Management Company, which is a unit of Allianz, and Alliance Capital Management, which is a unit of AXA. 
Investors in asset-backed securities are still questioning how bonds that had carried a top credit rating could now be worth just a fraction of their face value. Moody's Investors Service rated National Century's bonds AAA until Oct. 25. Credit Suisse First Boston underwrote the bonds, and J. P. Morgan Chase had two bankers on the National Century board, including Hal Pote, head of the audit committee. Deloitte & Touche audited the books. Both Bank One and J. P. Morgan were bond trustees. 
Most of these securities are backed by mortgages and other assets with relatively predictable cash flows. "They're supposed to be bullet proof," one specialist said.

HEADLINE: Metro Matters; 
No Taxes, No Foul At the Garden

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
QUESTION: How does a temporary tax abatement become a permanent one? Answer: When it was permanent from the start. Even if it wasn't supposed to be. Or was it?
 Call it the mystery of the tax exemption that will not go away. 
 On Monday, a Metro Matters column about the city's budget distress examined the city's policy of granting tax incentives and other subsidies to businesses and noted that Madison Square Garden has paid no property taxes since 1982, when the Knicks and Rangers threatened to leave town. 
The value of the tax break -- the forgiven taxes over 20 years -- has reached $200 million adjusted for inflation, the city's Independent Budget Office calculates. With the city facing both budget cuts and tax increases in the next fiscal year, it will not collect an estimated $6.9 million from the Garden in property tax. 
That seems odd, especially since City Hall originally portrayed its tax agreement with the Garden as a temporary one, expiring in 10 years. Just yesterday, former Mayor Edward I. Koch said he had thought in 1982 that he was authorizing a temporary tax benefit. "It was not only my intent -- I went to bed at night believing it was a 10-year abatement. There's no question," Mr. Koch said this week.
News accounts later questioned whether the deal was temporary, but the former mayor was still so sure that in a letter last year to a city councilman, he asked "who extended the tax break and why?"
Allen G. Schwartz, who represented Mr. Koch in negotiations with the Garden, thought the same. A tax break in perpetuity "was not my understanding, not what I negotiated," Mr. Schwartz, now a federal judge in Manhattan, said on Tuesday. "The deal we made, as I understood it, was that the Knicks and Rangers would be required to remain in New York City and the extent of the abatement would be for 10 years." What happened? "Somehow there was a slip between the cup and lip."
That the city would give tax relief of some duration to the Garden was not in question. It was a different city 20 years ago. Memories of the fiscal crisis of the mid-70's were still raw, and the prospect of losing more sports teams was unacceptable. The teams' threats to leave were taken seriously.
"The big money was in cable," recalled Judge Schwartz, Mr. Koch's first corporation counsel. "It didn't matter if the teams played in Madison Square Garden or across the river or in Nassau. When all was said and done, the consensus was, we had to keep them in the Garden."
THE agreement gave the Garden concessions from the unions, a reduction in power costs from the state and, as The Times wrote in April 1982, to no demurrals from the Koch administration, "a 10-year tax abatement" of the Garden's annual real estate tax bill. A subsequent Times article that month noted that if either team stopped playing in New York City for 10 consecutive years, the abatement ends "and the property is returned to the tax rolls."
As city and state documents confirm, the reference to 10 years was not to the abatement's duration, but to a requirement that the teams remain in the city for at least 10 years from the date of the agreement. The formal memorandum of understanding of July 15, 1982, said that the tax exemption "shall continue, as long as both of said teams play their home games therein and no longer."
Hadley W. Gold, the first assistant corporation counsel in 1982, drafted the agreement with Mr. Schwarz, he recalled this week. "To put some teeth into it, we said 'You've got to stay at least 10 years.' It doesn't say the exemption lasts 10 years."
In Mr. Gold's opinion, the agreement accurately reflected the city's intent and the state legislation, which he assumes was also drafted in the city corporation counsel's office, though he did not know by whom.
The memorandum of understanding was signed by Mr. Gold, Nathan Leventhal, a deputy mayor, and Richard H. Zahnd, then general counsel to Madison Square Garden. Mr. Zahnd said yesterday that he always understood that the abatement would apply as long as the teams played in New York City. Mr. Leventhal, who now advises Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, did not return calls to his home and office.
Mr. Koch said he took responsibility for the agreement since it happened on his watch, but -- ever the pragmatist -- said he was sure the tax exemption would have been extended if it had expired. O.K., but what went wrong? "Obviously something happened on the way to the forum that I was unaware of."

HEADLINE: THE MAYOR'S BUDGET PLAN: DEBT; 
Borrowing Called Tactic Best Left In the 70's

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
For people who recall the mid-1970's in New York well enough, what is happening now can raise hairs on the back of the neck.
 The city and the state face enormous budget deficits, they are already deeply in debt, and the economy is sluggish. It is hard now for many New Yorkers to remember just how bad the bad old days were, but the current talk of severe budget cuts, mass layoffs, higher transit fares, tax increases and appeals to Washington for a rescue seem like a flashback to the disco era. 
 Add one more throwback to that list, one that independent budget experts find especially troubling. For the first time since the 1970's, New York City is borrowing money on a large scale to pay for day-to-day operating expenses, rather than just for capital projects. New York State officials are also talking about doing the same thing, by selling bonds backed by revenue from the national tobacco settlement. 
Borrowing to pay for government operations was not part of the solution to New York's earlier fiscal crisis. It was part of the problem, a practice from the early 1970's that helped put the city (and, to a lesser degree, the state) into that deep hole.
"Borrowing for operating expenses is a big, big no-no, and the city has done it two years in a row," said Charles Brecher, research director of the Citizens Budget Commission. The commission is part of a small industry of watchdog groups that keep up a constant critique of city and state finances, all of them dedicated, to one degree or another, to making sure New York does not repeat the experience of the 1970's.
Brian D. Backstrom, president of Change New York, a conservative, anti-tax group, said: "The perfect analogy is to the '70's, when New York City set itself up for bankruptcy by using debt to pay for everyday operating expenses. I can't say this too forcefully: borrowing more money does not cure the problem, it only postpones it and makes it much, much worse. You're setting yourself up for fiscal disaster."
No one has suggested that fiscal gimmickry has sunk to the levels of three decades ago. Nor is there any doubt that New York, battered by recession and the destruction of the World Trade Center, is in severe enough straits to warrant extreme measures.
The city's problems appear especially dire. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has no easy options, and he is running out of hard ones, as well; he is calling for budget cuts, tax increases, and help from Albany. His plan is already in trouble, as state officials have said they will not approve his proposal to tax people who commute into the city.
The city has a $1.1 billion deficit in its current fiscal year, and projects a $6.4 billion deficit in the year starting next July 1. Gov. George E. Pataki's administration has refused to say how big a deficit the state is running in the current year, or how large the problem will be in the fiscal year that starts April 1. Most experts believe the state can cover its shortfall for the current year without any drastic moves, but the next year's deficit has been estimated at $5 billion to $10 billion.
It is standard practice for governments to borrow more than usual in bad times to bridge the chasm. But New York City and State already carry the heaviest debt burdens in the nation, other than the federal government, and financial analysts and Wall Street rating firms frown on their borrowing more.
Last week, Mr. Bloomberg vowed not to repeat the mistakes of the 1970's. He said one of his guiding principles was to "address the problems that we have and take responsibility ourselves to solve those problems, not to postpone them with debt financing and not to give them to the future with one-shot solutions."
Earlier this year, though, the mayor requested and received permission from Albany to borrow $1.5 billion to pay for operating expenses. Mr. Bloomberg called that a one-time departure, to cover the effects of the trade center attack.
It is not clear yet what the state will do, but a growing number of legislators are talking about borrowing against the tobacco settlement to get through the next year or two. The hope behind that approach is that the economy will turn, revenues will rise and the crisis will resolve itself without great sacrifice.
The critics said that was a dangerous theory.
"It won't work, even if we return to a late-1990's growth rate," Mr. Brecher said. "There is no way to imagine an economic scenario that closes deficits as big as the city and state have. We are not just going to grow our way out of this."

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Britain: Support For Rate Cut Ebbs 

BYLINE:  By Suzanne Kapner (NYT)

 BODY:
 Support for an interest rate cut among Bank of England policy makers ebbed at the most recent meeting, on Nov. 6 and Nov. 7, notes from the meeting show. Two members voted to lower interest rates at the meeting, compared with three who did so at the previous meeting in October. 
Policy makers cited improvements in the domestic economy, including an increasing rate of economic growth in the third quarter, and soaring house prices, as reasons to hold the benchmark interest rate steady at 4 percent, its lowest level in 38 years. In contrast, United States Federal Reserve policy makers voted unanimously on Nov. 6 to lower the benchmark borrowing rate by half a percentage point, to 1.25 percent, to stimulate economic growth.

'Homestand' for Expos Approved by Owners

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
For a team that was earmarked for extinction a year ago, the Montreal Expos consume a disproportionate amount of Major League Baseball's attention. At an owners meeting in a Dallas suburb yesterday, a 22-game schedule of Expos games was approved for next season in San Juan, P.R., and a committee was appointed to study the Expos' permanent relocation in the near future.
 Commissioner Bud Selig did not set a 2003 payroll for the Expos, but club officials believed that with the additional revenue generated by the games in Puerto Rico, they would be able to retain higher-priced players like Vladimir Guerrero, Bartolo Colon and Javier Vazquez. 
 The clubs, which own the Expos and would like to see them increase their revenue, approved the plan for three homestands at Hiram Bithorn Stadium, where 19,891 fans saw Toronto and Texas play the first game of the 2001 season. The Expos averaged 10,000 a game last season.
Although the players association must still approve the plan, it calls for 10 games in April against the Mets (a four-game series April 11-14), Atlanta and Cincinnati; six in June against Anaheim and Texas; and six in September against Florida and the Chicago Cubs. All of the teams have attractive Latin players.
Even more important will be the recommendation of a committee that is studying the options for the Expos' relocation. Two club officials, Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox and Wendy Selig-Prieb of the Milwaukee Brewers, and several major league officials will determine the city that will provide the greatest likelihood of success for the Expos, who will be the first major league team to move since 1972.
Early this year Selig called Washington the prime city for relocation, and Washington, along with Portland, Ore., have been the most aggressive cities interested in landing a major league team. But baseball has to decide if putting the Expos in Washington or northern Virginia would undermine the Baltimore Orioles' economic base.
In another scheduling decision, the clubs approved a season-opening two-game series between Seattle and Oakland March 25 and 26 in Tokyo. It will be the fourth time in the last five years that the season will open outside the United States and Canada.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES; 
In Bush's Words: 'The Enlargement of NATO Is Good for All Who Join Us'

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of the speech by President Bush yesterday in Prague, as recorded by the White House.
 This NATO summit that convenes tomorrow will be the first ever held at the capital of a Warsaw Pact. The days of the Warsaw Pact seem distant -- they must seem to you. After all, the Warsaw Pact ended a half a lifetime ago for you. It was a dark and distant era. 
 The years since have brought great challenge and great hope to all of the countries on this continent. And tomorrow in Prague, we will have reached a decisive moment, an historic moment. For tomorrow, we will invite new members into our alliance. It's a bold decision, to guarantee the freedom of millions of people. 
At the summit, we'll make the most significant reforms in NATO since 1949 -- reforms which will allow our alliance to effectively confront new dangers. And in the years to come, all of the nations of Europe will determine their place in world events. They will take up global responsibilities, or choose to live in isolation from the challenges of our time.
As for America, we made our choice. We are committed to work toward world peace, and we're committed to a close and permanent partnership with the nations of Europe. The Atlantic alliance is America's most important global relationship. 
We're tied to Europe by history. We are tied to Europe by the wars of liberty we have fought and won together. We're joined by broad ties of trade. And America is bound to Europe by the deepest convictions of our common culture -- our belief in the dignity of every life, and our belief in the power of conscience to move history.
And this city, and town squares across the Czech Republic, are monuments to Jan Hus, who said this: "Stand in the truth you have learned, for it conquers all and is mighty to eternity." That ideal has given life to the Czech Republic, and it is shared by the republic I lead.
America believes that a strong, confident Europe is good for the world. We welcome the economic integration of Europe. We believe that integration will extend prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. 
We welcome a democratic Russia as part of this new Europe, because a free and peaceful Europe will add to the security of this continent. We welcome the growing unity of Europe in commerce and currency and military cooperation, which is closing a long history of rivalry and violence. This continent, wounded by Nazism and communism, is becoming peaceful and secure and democratic for the first time. And now that the countries of Europe are united in freedom, they will no longer fight each other and bring war to the rest of the world.
Because America supports a more united Europe, we strongly support the enlargement of NATO, now and in the future. Every European democracy that seeks NATO membership and is ready to share in NATO's responsibilities should be welcome in our alliance. The enlargement of NATO is good for all who join us.
The standards for membership are high, and they encourage the hard work of political and economic and military reform. And nations in the family of NATO, old or new, know this: anyone who would choose you for an enemy also chooses us for an enemy. Never again in the face of aggression will you stand alone.
A larger NATO is good for Russia, as well. Later this week, I will visit St. Petersburg. I will tell my friend Vladimir Putin and the Russian people that they, too, will gain from the security and stability of nations to Russia's west. Russia does not require a buffer zone of protection; it needs peaceful and prosperous neighbors who are also friends. We need a strong and democratic Russia as our friend and partner to face the next century's new challenges.
Through the NATO-Russia Council, we must increase our cooperation with Russia for the security of all of us. 
Expansion of NATO also brings many advantages to the alliance itself. Every new member contributes military capabilities that add to our common security. We see this already in Afghanistan, for forces from Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, Slovakia and others have joined with 16 NATO allies to help defeat global terror. And every new member of our alliance makes a contribution of character.
Tomorrow, NATO grows larger. Tomorrow, the soul of Europe grows stronger.
Members recently added to NATO and those invited to join bring greater clarity to purposes of our alliance, because they understand the lessons of the last century. Those with fresh memories of tyranny know the value of freedom. Those who have lived through a struggle of good against evil are never neutral between them. Czechs and Slovaks learned through the harsh experience of 1938 that when great democracies fail to confront danger, greater dangers follow. And the people of the Baltics learned that aggression left unchecked by the great democracies can rob millions of their liberty and their lives.
In Central and Eastern Europe, the courage and moral vision of prisoners and exiles and priests and playwrights caused tyrants to fall. The spirit now sustains these nations through difficult reforms. And this spirit is needed in the councils of a new Europe.
Our NATO alliance faces dangers very different from those it was formed to confront. Yet never has our need for collective defense been more urgent. 
The Soviet Union is gone, but freedom still has enemies. We're threatened by terrorism; bred within failed states, it's present within our own cities. We're threatened by the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons, which are produced by outlaw regimes and could be delivered either by missile or terrorist cell. For terrorists and terrorist states, every free nation -- every free nation -- is a potential target, including the free nations of Europe.
We're making progress on this, the first war of the 21st century. Today more than 90 nations are joined in a global coalition to defeat terror. We're sharing intelligence. We're freezing the assets of terror groups. We're pursuing the terrorists wherever they plot and train. And we're finding them and bringing them to justice, one person at a time.
Today the world is also uniting to answer the unique and urgent threat posed by Iraq. A dictator who has used weapons of mass destruction on his own people must not be allowed to produce or possess those weapons. We will not permit Saddam Hussein to blackmail and/or terrorize nations which love freedom.
Last week, Saddam Hussein accepted U.N. inspectors. We've heard those pledges before and seen them violated time and time again. We now call an end to that game of deception and deceit and denial. 
Saddam Hussein has been given a very short time to declare completely and truthfully his arsenal of terror. Should he again deny that this arsenal exists, he will have entered his final stage with a lie. And deception this time will not be tolerated. Delay and defiance will invite the severest of consequences.
America's goal, the world's goal, is more than the return of inspectors to Iraq. Our goal is to secure the peace through the comprehensive and verified disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Voluntarily, or by force, that goal will be achieved.
To meet all of this century's emerging threats, from terror camps in remote regions to hidden laboratories of outlaw regimes, NATO must develop new military capabilities. NATO forces must become better able to fight side by side. Those forces must be more mobile and more swiftly deployed. The allies need more special operations forces, better precision strike capabilities and more modern command structures.
Few NATO members will have state-of-the-art capabilities in all of these areas, I recognize that. But every nation should develop some. Ours is a military alliance, and every member must make a military contribution to that alliance. For some allies, this will require higher defense spending. For all of us, it will require more effective defense spending, with each nation adding the tools and technologies to fight and win a new kind of war.
And because many threats to the NATO members come from outside of Europe, NATO forces must be organized to operate outside of Europe. When forces were needed quickly in Afghanistan, NATO's options were limited. We must build new capabilities and we must strengthen our will to use those capabilities.
The United States proposes the creation of a NATO response force that will bring together well equipped, highly ready air, ground and sea forces from NATO allies -- old and new. This force will be prepared to deploy on short notice wherever it is needed. A NATO response force will take time to create, and we should begin that effort here in Prague.
Yet security against new threats requires more than just new capabilities. Free nations must accept our shared obligations to keep the peace. The world needs the nations of this continent to be active in the defense of freedom, not inward-looking or isolated by indifference. Ignoring dangers or excusing aggression may temporarily avert conflict, but they don't bring true peace.
International stability must be actively defended, and all nations that benefit from that stability have a duty to help. In this noble work, America and the strong democracies of Europe need each other, each playing our full and responsible role. The good we can do together is far greater than the good we can do apart.
Great evil is stirring in the world. Many of the young here are coming up in a different world, different era, a different time, a different series of threats. We face perils we've never thought about, perils we've never seen before. But they're dangerous. They're just as dangerous as those perils that your fathers and mothers and grandfathers and grandmothers faced.
The hopes of all mankind depend on the courage and the unity of great democracies. In this hour of challenge, NATO will do what it has done before: we will stand firm against the enemies of freedom, and we'll prevail.
The trans-Atlantic ties of Europe and America have met every test of history, and we intend to again. U-boats could not divide us. The threats and standoffs of the cold war did not make us weary. The commitment of my nation to Europe is found in the carefully tended graves of young Americans who died for this continent's freedom. That commitment is shown by the thousands in uniforms still serving here, from the Balkans to Bavaria, still willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for this continent's future.
For a hundred years, place names of Europe have often stood for conflict and tragedy and loss. Single words evoke sad and bitter experience -- Verdun, Munich, Stalingrad, Dresden, Nuremberg and Yalta. We have no power to rewrite history. We do have the power to write a different story for our time.
When future generations look back at this moment and speak of Prague and what we did here, that name will stand for hope. In Prague, young democracies will gain new security, a grand alliance will gather a strength and find new purpose, and America and Europe will renew the historic friendship that still keeps the peace of the world.
Thank you for your interest. May God bless you all.

HEADLINE: Stingy Lame Ducks 

 BODY:
The Senate is to be commended for overcoming some justifiable misgivings and approving the homeland security bill, something that both President Bush and the American people plainly wanted. The consolidation of 22 agencies and nearly 170,000 federal employees into a new domestic security department is the most ambitious piece of government re-engineering since the creation of the Defense Department more than 50 years ago. The Senate also did the right thing by approving another very useful piece of legislation arising from the events of 9/11, a terrorism insurance bill that could provide a needed boost to the economy. 
 Like just about everything involving the 107th Congress, none of this was easy. Approval of the new cabinet department came only after Republican leaders promised wary senators that a bunch of mischievous, pro-business amendments that the House added to the bill at the last minute would be redone next year. Inevitably, there was some ambiguity about what that meant. The Senate thought it heard a firm promise to repeal these provisions. Some House members said they would merely be revised. The Senate should stick to its guns and make sure the offending amendments are jettisoned altogether. 
 Regrettably, however, this Congress is about to recede into history without crafting a decent unemployment insurance package that would give hope to the jobless. Now that the Senate has adjourned, the responsibility for preventing this shameful outcome rests squarely on the House, which will meet tomorrow to clear up a few details on the homeland security bill, and on President Bush, who needs to show the same passion for the victims of the recession that he did for homeland security. 
At issue is the federal emergency unemployment assistance program, authorized last March as part of an economic stimulus package. The program, which provides 13 weeks of temporary federal help to jobless workers whose state benefits have ended, is scheduled to expire on Dec. 28.
Both chambers passed very different bills to extend the program. The Senate bill would extend it through March 29. The House would keep it alive for a mere five weeks beyond the end of the year -- and then only for people who are already enrolled by Dec. 28. Under this scenario, thousands of workers who are expected to exhaust their regular benefits early in the new year would get no federal help.
The Senate rightly rejected the House version as too stingy. The only hope for the unemployed, therefore, is for the House to accept the more generous Senate plan tomorrow. That's a long shot, but if the House does nothing, the program will stop dead on Dec. 28, not only denying federal help to workers whose state benefits expire in January but robbing people already in the program of benefits that are still due.
House Republicans argue that the $5 billion Senate bill is too expensive. They also promise to make everyone whole when they come back in January. This is a risky scenario. It's also callous, especially in view of the House's stated determination to lock in huge tax cuts for the wealthy when it returns. Mr. Bush should intervene.
