The Climate Debate
 To the Editor:
 Re '''Feel Good' vs. 'Do Good' on Climate'' (Findings, Sept. 11): Bjorn Lomborg, the self-described skeptical environmentalist, is best taken with a healthy dose of his own medicine: skepticism. Global climate disruption from greenhouse gas pollution cannot be compared to the effects of New York City's urban heat island. 
 Economic models have shown that policies to cap and reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a minimal impact on economic growth. Instead, they will speed the development of new technologies. And most important, they will help prevent the potentially catastrophic climate changes that would truly add to human suffering and poverty. 
 W. L. Chameides Durham, N.C. The writer is dean of the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University.
 To the Editor:
 Despite the picture of polar bears in the desert that accompanied John Tierney's column, the article totally ignores the potential catastrophic effects of climate change on the world's ecosystems. The article would have us believe that the only dangers posed by climate change are the rise of a foot or two in sea level and a few more deaths on hot summer days. While it is true that no one knows exactly what global warming will bring, the potential risks are far more complex and serious and should not be oversimplified.
 Robert Stuart, M.D. Oakland, Calif.
 To the Editor:
 John Tierney writes only about human beings. Are we going to provide air conditioners to the polar bears et al., too?

 Pain and Morphine
 To the Editor:
 Re ''In India, a Quest to Ease the Pain of the Dying'' (Sept. 11) : Having spent years as a hospice volunteer, I am all too familiar with the excruciating pain often experienced by cancer patients. In India and elsewhere, the means to alleviate their pain, in the form of morphine, is readily available and relatively inexpensive. 
 Ignoring the palliative potential of morphine simply to satisfy bureaucratic paranoia and corporate greed borders on the barbaric. With every patient who dies in agony, a bit of our collective humanity dies too. 
 Dennis B. Appleton Madison, Wis.
 Diagnosing Double Vision
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Not Autistic or Hyperactive, Just Seeing Double at Times'' (Sept. 11): I, too, had convergence insufficiency. Unlike the young girl in your story, however, I did not get a diagnosis until after I had to leave law school because of reading problems. 
 I urge your readers whose children are bright but nonetheless struggling with school to think outside the box. Just because the doctor or the school nurse says a child's vision is normal does not mean there is no vision disorder. 
 Margaret Dore Seattle
 Of Mothers and Dreams
 To the Editor:
 ''Anxious Dreams Common In Early Motherhood'' (Vital Signs, Sept. 11) brought up another connection for me. I well remember my own anxiety dreams during and after pregnancy. But in the hospital recently recuperating from a complete hysterectomy, I was visited by several extraordinarily comforting dreams, all to do with hundreds of small children, safely bundled and snuggling together. Free from responsibility at last?

HEADLINE: Safer Air Cargo (2 Letters)

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Unprotected Air Cargo'' (editorial, Sept. 5):
 You write about the Transportation Security Administration's lack of commitment to a ''good'' law passed by Congress to ensure all air cargo carried on passenger planes be screened. 
 The law that was passed is good. We worked closely with Congress to develop requirements that significantly increase air cargo security while not causing bottlenecks of cargo at our nation's airports, a situation that brings another set of risks. We will meet the requirements to screen 50 percent of cargo within 18 months and 100 percent within three years.
 The assumption that private parties cannot perform security functions is off base. Effective security measures provided by private parties are numerous, including at banks, nuclear facilities and at corporate buildings. Screening could include the use of canines, explosives trace detection, X-ray and visual inspections, not just a piece of paper that says you are ''trustworthy.''
 The T.S.A. is working aggressively toward, and will meet, the goals we worked with Congress to develop. 
 Kip Hawley Administrator Transportation Security Administration Washington, Sept. 10, 2007
 To the Editor:
 The global consensus is that the most effective way to protect air cargo is to secure the shipments on the factory floor and protect them through arrival at the airport and on to the aircraft. This idea has bipartisan Congressional support. 
 A certified shipper program, when put into effect, would properly address the threat while allowing shippers to continue to rely on commercial air transport to deliver lifesaving medicines, just-in-time parts and equipment. 
 While it is easy to call for the government to open each piece of air cargo at the airport, such a requirement would ignore threat assessments, expert opinion and the lack of suitable inspection technology and would have a huge impact on our economy. 
 While security of the skies is our top priority, we recognize that the government must make hard choices on how to use limited resources to address multiple threats. The Transportation Security Administration is following Congressional intent to secure air cargo. Let the agency do its job.

HEADLINE: Through the Forest, a Clearer View of the Needs of a People

BYLINE: By CHRISTIE ASCHWANDEN

DATELINE: A LUOI VALLEY, Vietnam 

 BODY:
Phung Tuu Boi reaches down to inspect one of the spiny shrubs lined up in a row before him. A few feet away, a cow grazes serenely in this emerald valley in the hills of central Vietnam.
 Mr. Boi, a forester and director of the Center for Assistance in Nature Conservation and Community Development in Hanoi, points to the cow. ''See this?'' he says. ''Very, very bad.'' 
 An invisible poison clings to the soil beneath the cow's muddy hoofs. During a short stretch of the Vietnam War this patch of ground served as an American Special Forces air base, and while the soldiers departed long ago, a potent dioxin from the Agent Orange that they stored and sprayed here lingers still. 
 Mr. Boi, a lively, passionate man whose enormous smile rarely leaves his face, has dedicated his career to repairing the ecological damage left by what people here call the American War. And while he has had much success in the last 30 years, his task is far from over. 
 When Mr. Boi began working here in 1975, he found an ecosystem decimated by war. Aerial spraying of defoliants like Agent Orange had destroyed large swaths of forest. Without live roots to anchor the soil, monsoon rains washed away the topsoil and its nutrients, allowing invasive grasses to take over and prevent forest regeneration.
 A botanist by training, Mr. Boi's initial goal was to reforest the denuded land. But he soon realized the forest ecosystem was not the only thing struggling to recover from Agent Orange. 
 The Pako, Ta Oi, Catu and Kinh people of A Luoi valley (called A Shau during the war) eke out a meager existence in a region with one of Vietnam's shortest growing seasons. (This reporter visited the valley on a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.) These tribal groups, who live in one-room huts with dirt floors and no indoor plumbing, depend on forest products to survive, and Mr. Boi came to recognize that his work was as vital to them as to the tigers and elephants whose habitat he was working to restore. 
 Mr. Boi enlisted the help of the Australian acacia tree. The acacia grows up to six and a half feet per year and, after five years, can be harvested to make paper and furniture. The tree also improves the soil and quickly provides the canopy that trees need to take root. 
 ''It's a good model for forest restoration,'' said Chris Dickinson, a conservation biologist and technical adviser with the World Wildlife Fund for Nature in Hue, Vietnam, adding that the acacia ''grows on poor nutrients and can shade out the grasses.'' 
 The trees also provide residents with a cash crop. ''The demand for acacia is seemingly insatiable,'' Dr. Dickinson said. ''Ikea uses it for garden furniture.'' 
 Mr. Boi has used this humble acacia tree to reforest thousands of hectares in central Vietnam. Emboldened by these successes, he has applied his botanical model of remediation to tackle a far more difficult problem. 
 Though dioxin has dropped to relatively low levels in areas that were aerially sprayed during the war, studies by Canadian scientists have shown that numerous highly contaminated spots remain at certain places where American forces stored Agent Orange. 
 The cow that caught Mr. Boi's attention grazes on one such ''hot spot,'' the former A So air base in Dong Son, where scientists from Hatfield Consultants in Vancouver, British Columbia, have measured soil levels of TCDD, the dioxin in Agent Orange, more than 200 times greater than the residential standard set forth by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 
 Dioxin takes decades to break down. Remediating this site would require millions of dollars, and when it comes to financing, the more heavily populated hot spots in Danang and Bien Hoa take precedence.
 If the Dong Son hot spot were in New Jersey or Florida, a barbed wire fence and a warning might be enough to deter people from entering the area, but such solutions break down in the face of extreme poverty. ''You put up a fence, and the people are so poor that anything they can get their hands on, they'll take down and use,'' said Wayne Dwernychuk, an environmental scientist who did studies for Hatfield Consultants. 
 ''Their economy is geared to agriculture,'' Dr. Dwernychuk said. ''If you take that land out of the production cycle, it's very hard to rationalize to them when they don't see the problem.'' 
 He added that the chemical that taints this soil could not be seen, smelled or tasted. 
 Pointing to the former air base's most contaminated site, Mr. Boi said: ''The local people are poor and uneducated, and they don't understand. Children come here to play and they collect insects and other things to eat.'' 
 Dioxin accumulates in animal fats, and the molecules also glom onto soil particles that can be ingested through inadequately washed root crops like manioc. Poor sanitation and a diet that relies on fowl that peck on tainted soil keep dioxin exposure a constant threat. Dr. Dwernychuk and his colleagues have found elevated TCDD levels in the blood and breast milk of local residents, evidence that the chemical continues to make its way into the food chain.
 Nguyen Van Phom, the mayor of Dong Son, blames dioxin for the health problems he says plague 60 of the 240 families in the village. Whether these conditions, which include limb deformities and deafness, are the result of dioxin remains unproved, though the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences has linked Agent Orange exposure in American veterans to an increased risk of some health problems, including cancer and diabetes. 
 The Canadian studies prompted the Vietnamese government to move more than two dozen families off the most contaminated ground, but efforts to educate residents about the risks have proved difficult. Most cannot read and many speak only faltering Vietnamese, relying instead on tribal dialects. 
 Mr. Boi has developed a low-tech solution to overcome these problems: a fence made of trees covered with cactus-sharp needles to deter humans and animals alike. Mr. Boi hopes this so-called green fence will not only discourage trespassers, but also provide them with an economic incentive to leave the barrier intact. Once mature, the trees he has chosen to make up the fence, Gleditschia australis, produce a fruit that residents can sell to make soaps and medicinals. Gleditschia, a type of honey locust, is disease and insect resistant, and its thorns and soft wood should deter residents from cutting it down for firewood. 
 The green fence promises a workable solution to a costly problem, said William H. Farland, a former scientist with the Environmental Protection Agency who is vice president for research at Colorado State University. ''It's very expensive to clean dioxin up to background levels,'' Dr. Farland said. ''The main issue is to prevent human exposure, not just to clean up the soils.''
 While a full remediation project would cost millions of dollars, Mr. Boi estimated that his project could be done for just $30,000. Last December, with the help of a $10,000 grant from the World Bank and the aid of about a dozen farmers, Mr. Boi planted the first 10,000 seeding trees. But despite its auspicious start, the project has hit a few snags.
 Though hardy, the locust trees failed to thrive in soil stripped of its nutrients by rains that followed defoliation decades ago, and a spate of intense storms flooded the site shortly after planting, drowning many of the seedlings. With their thorns still small, the trees that survived made attractive food for wandering livestock. Today, only a single row of small trees remain. 
 In the face of these challenges, no one would fault Mr. Boi for returning to his comfortable office in Hanoi and moving on to something else. But he views this setback as nothing more than a necessary learning experience. With the lessons gleaned from his initial failure, he has developed a new plan.
 Before his next round of planting, Mr. Boi will bolster the soil with fertilizers. Then he will plant larger seedlings, and in addition to the original locust fence, he will add rows of acacia on either side to create a three-layer fence. The acacia will help protect the locust trees, improve the soil and provide another cash crop for residents, Mr. Boi says, pointing to a photo schemata of the fence that he carries with him everywhere, sharing with anyone who will listen.
 Mr. Boi needs $20,000 more to finish the fence. He has received no government financing and has resorted to spending his own money to keep the project alive. But Mr. Boi refuses to give up, even if it means digging deeper into his own pockets. Success is his only option. If he gives up on this project, the cows will continue to graze on tainted soil, and another generation of children will grow up eating insects caked with dioxin-rich dirt.

HEADLINE: From Ozone Success, a Potential Climate Model

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
In 1985, scientists studying the air over Antarctica stumbled on a gaping breach in the billion-year-old atmospheric radiation shield that makes Earth's surface habitable.
 The discovery of a seasonal ''hole'' in this veil of ozone molecules was so unexpected -- ''the surprise of the century,'' one chemist later called it -- that it was presumed to be a data glitch. 
 It wasn't. Soon other experts found a connection between the ozone hole and the use of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, and similar synthetic chemicals in solvents, refrigeration, sprays and the like. 
 The chemical threat to the ozone layer had been identified in 1974, and industries and governments were planning to shift to safer substitutes. But it took the ozone hole, glaring from satellite images like a purple bruise, to make eliminating such chemicals a global imperative. On Sept. 16, 1987, an initial batch of countries signed the Montreal Protocol, a treaty that has since grown and led to bans on 95 percent of the ozone-eating compounds. 
 On Sunday, diplomats, scientists and environmentalists gathered in Montreal to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the treaty and to spend a week discussing possible new steps to speed an end to remaining ozone threats. 
 Many are using the anniversary to bolster the idea that a similar success can be achieved with carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases linked to global warming (including some of the ozone-destroying chemicals and some of the replacements for them). Fresh international climate talks begin at the United Nations on Monday and at a meeting in Washington organized by the White House late next week. Some veterans of both the ozone and climate fights insist that the Montreal success is a model for climate action. 
 ''The lesson from Montreal is that curbing global warming will not be as hard as it looks,'' said David D. Doniger, an early campaigner against ozone-damaging chemicals for the Natural Resources Defense Council who now directs the group's climate work. 
 But many experts on the circumstances -- scientific, diplomatic and economic -- surrounding the 1987 treaty signing say that while some things are similar now, like the looming environmental risks revealed by evolving science, almost everything else is very different. 
 Ozone molecules, tenuous trios of oxygen atoms, serve as a planetary sun block of sorts, limiting the bombardment of the Earth's surface by ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancers and cataracts, and harm some plants and animals. 
 When F. Sherwood Rowland and Mario J. Molina first posited in 1974 that CFCs and similar chemicals could waft to the stratosphere and break up ozone, the threat quickly captured public attention. 
 In 1977, long before the climate disaster movie ''The Day After Tomorrow,'' Hollywood released ''Day of the Animals,'' in which ozone destruction caused wildlife to run amok. 
 But it was cancer that really brought the issue home, said Susan Solomon, a senior scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who in 1986 led work linking CFCs and related chemicals to polar ozone losses. ''Skin cancer is deeply personal, and virtually every person on the planet has either known someone who has had cancer or had it themselves,'' Dr. Solomon said. 
 The risks from global warming are far different, said Dr. Solomon, who was the co-leader of the latest scientific report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ''It is much less personal for most people, except perhaps if you're in places like Vanuatu,'' she said, referring to one of several low-lying island nations threatened by rising seas. ''It's mostly beyond our generation.''
 In the 1980s, despite persistent scientific uncertainties over the threat to the ozone layer, action to move away from ozone-damaging chemicals was swift, largely because there was little cost involved and alternatives were developed as the need arose, experts said. 
 To preserve the ozone shield, the United States, joined soon by Canada and Scandinavian countries, banned ''nonessential'' uses of CFCs -- hair sprays, for example -- in 1978, just three years after the theory was first described in the journal Nature.
 The Natural Resources Defense Council, seizing on an opening left by a proposed rule to limit CFCs that was written in the last days of the Carter administration, filed a lawsuit in 1984 that prompted the Environmental Protection Agency to seek broader bans. The domestic action helped set the stage for treaty talks. 
 ''That N.R.D.C. suit was critical because it turned the burden of proof around from having to show there was a problem to proving there was not,'' said Roger A. Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
 Still, $135 billion worth of air conditioners and other equipment in the United States, and billions more around the world, relied on the old chemicals, and the science remained murky. So DuPont and other companies waited to seek alternatives, according to company scientists. 
 In 1985, the murk cleared somewhat. An international scientific assessment of CFCs and ozone created a near-worldwide consensus that the risks of allowing the long-lived chemicals to keep building in the atmosphere were unacceptable. 
 DuPont, while gaining less than 2 percent of its revenues from such compounds, saw a need to find substitutes and the prospect of new markets, and began a $500 million research effort that spawned a suite of alternatives. 
 With global warming, in contrast, economists and climate experts say it will take billions of dollars a year in basic research, sustained over many years, to even have a chance of finding energy sources that can compete with fossil fuels but produce no greenhouse gases.
 In addition, the ozone treaty gave developing countries a decade-long grace period on CFC phaseouts and compensated them for the cost of shifting to safer chemicals. Talks over strengthening climate agreements have stumbled repeatedly over efforts to get concrete commitments on emissions cuts from the United States, and the involvement of developing countries, particularly giants like China. 
 The final momentum for the Montreal treaty was provided by the discovery of the ozone hole, which served as kind of wake-up call, for the first time bringing home the realization that humans could have a direct effect on the planet's future. 
 Environmental campaigners have for years been seeking a comparable icon for climate change, be it drowning polar bears, Hurricane Katrina or the deadly European heat wave of 2003. But the incremental nature of the threat posed by building greenhouse gases is for many still trumped by concerns like Iraq and health care. 
 Mack McFarland, the chief atmospheric scientist for DuPont, said the surprise appearance of the ozone hole should serve as a warning to anyone waiting for stronger evidence of danger before acting to cut emissions of greenhouse gases. 
 ''The science of ozone is so simple compared to the global climate system,'' Dr. MacFarland said. Referring to the discovery of the polar hole, he added: ''If we missed something so fundamental with ozone, what are we missing with the climate system? Admittedly, it can go either way. But do we want to take that chance?''

HEADLINE: Suit Blaming Automakers Over Gases Is Dismissed

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
The courts do not have the authority or the expertise to decide injury lawsuits concerning global warming, a federal judge in San Francisco ruled yesterday in dismissing a suit brought by the State of California against six car companies.
 The decision, by Judge Martin J. Jenkins, was welcome news for automakers, which had suffered a defeat last week in federal court in Vermont. 
 In last week's decision, Judge William K. Sessions III endorsed Vermont's regulations meant to reduce greenhouse gases emitted by cars and light trucks. More than a dozen states have similar regulations, and a lawsuit challenging such regulations in California is pending. 
 In the case decided yesterday, California claimed that the six car companies produced vehicles that accounted for more than 20 percent of human-generated carbon dioxide emissions in the United States and more than 30 percent of those in California.
 The suit claimed that the emissions were a public nuisance and sought billions of dollars in damages. 
 Judge Jenkins wrote that a resolving of the questions presented in the suit was not a proper task for the courts.
 ''The adjudication of plaintiff's claim would require the court to balance the competing interests of reducing global warming emissions and the interests of advancing and preserving economic and industrial development,'' Judge Jenkins wrote. 
 The two decisions are not necessarily at odds. They collectively suggest that states may address climate change through their legislatures and executive branches but not through the courts.
 Given national and international debate on the issues, Judge Jenkins wrote, ''the court finds that injecting itself into the global warming thicket at this juncture would require an initial policy determination of the type reserved for the political branches of government.''
 Indeed, he continued, a decision from the court on awarding damages for increasing global warming could potentially undermine the choices of the political branches.
 Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for the car companies, said Judge Jenkins had shown appropriate deference to the other branches of government. 
 ''Our bottom-line point is that global warming presents exceedingly complex policy issues that must be addressed at the national and international levels by Congress and the president, not through lawsuits seeking damages in the federal courts,'' Mr. Boutrous said. ''We are pleased that Judge Jenkins agreed and dismissed this lawsuit.''
 Kenneth P. Alex, a lawyer in the California attorney general's office, said, ''We're disappointed with the ruling and are studying it closely.'' He said no decision had been made about an appeal.
 ''We do understand,'' Mr. Alex said, ''that it is difficult for a district court judge to jump into a global warming dispute.''
 Judge Jenkins wrote that the Constitution's assignment of interstate commerce and foreign policy powers to Congress and the president rather than to the courts supported his decision.
 He said he was reluctant in any event to expose automakers, utility companies and other industries to damages ''for doing nothing more than lawfully engaging in their respective spheres of commerce within those states.'' 
 He added that he would not know how to calculate the harms caused by the emissions even if he were to entertain the suit.
 ''The court is left without guidance in determining what is an unreasonable contribution to the sum of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere,'' Judge Jenkins wrote, ''or in determining who should bear the costs associated with global climate change that admittedly result from multiple sources around the globe.''

HEADLINE: Lender Raises a Growth Forecast

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Exceptional growth in China and India prompted the Asian Development Bank to raise its forecast for economic growth in developing Asia this year to a collective 8.3 percent from 7.6 percent. The lender, based in Manila, also raised its forecast for 2008 to 8.2 percent from 7.7 percent, but warned that the region could face pitfalls, including volatile oil prices and the impact of credit market strains on the United States economy, an important export market. ''This reassessment stems from the exceptionally strong performance of Asia's giants: the People's Republic of China and India,'' said Ifzal Ali, the bank's chief economist, who added that ''the headline numbers for 2007 have also been lifted by faster-than-expected growth in Indonesia and the Philippines.''

Oil soared to another record yesterday on worries that global energy supplies could shrink to critical levels during this winter heating season because of strong growth in demand.
 Crude oil settled at $80.57 a barrel for October delivery in regular trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and was continuing to rise after hours. 
 Expectations that the Federal Reserve will agree to cut interest rates when it meets today also supported oil and other commodities markets, raising the likelihood that the economy will weather a credit crisis.
 Though oil prices have quadrupled since 2002, when adjusted for inflation the price is still below the $90-a-barrel peaks at the time of the Iranian revolution in 1979.
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on a small supply increase last week, but analysts said the decision to raise output by 500,000 barrels a day starting Nov. 1 was not enough to reverse a rally that has lifted prices around 30 percent this year.
 ''We believe that this will be too little, too late, barring an outright collapse in demand, and now expect inventories to draw to critical levels this winter,'' the investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a research note.
 Goldman said it expected oil prices to hit $85 a barrel by the end of this year.
 Crude supplies are running at their lowest level in eight months in the United States while gasoline supplies are at their lowest level since Hurricane Katrina knocked out several Gulf Coast refineries in 2005.
 Analysts expect oil and gasoline supplies to fall further after recent storms in the Gulf of Mexico crimped imports and refinery operations.
 Other commodities also shot higher yesterday. Gold reached a 16-month high, supported by expectations of an interest rate cut that could increase investment flows.

HEADLINE: Official Assurances Fail to Stem Rush of Withdrawals at British Bank

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 17 

 BODY:
Terry Mays and his wife, both retirees, decided during the weekend that a promise by the Bank of England to provide emergency financing for Northern Rock, the troubled British mortgage lender that has most of their savings, was not enough to calm their nerves.
 The couple joined hundreds of other Northern Rock customers Monday as lines formed for a third day in front of branches where people waited to withdraw their savings. 
 ''I don't think the bank will collapse -- but we just don't have the nerves,'' Mr. Mays said, surrounded by a group of depositors who had traveled with him to the central London branch from a southern one after being told that the wait there would be at least six hours. ''I took some financial advice over the weekend, and I'm taking the money out to get peace of mind. We're relying on this money for our pension.''
 Panicky customers have withdrawn $:2 billion ($4 billion), since the bank acknowledged Friday that it could no longer raise money because of the credit squeeze that has constrained global markets after a meltdown in the market for subprime loans in the United States.
 So far, assurances from Northern Rock's chief executive, Adam J. Applegarth, and the chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, that deposits were securely backed by the Bank of England have failed to impress depositors.
 In a bid to shore up confidence, Mr. Darling announced on Monday that the government would guarantee all deposits in Northern Rock even if the bank should collapse and would extend similar guarantees to any other troubled financial institution that approached the government. No other bank or institution had yet approached the Bank of England, he added.
 Unlike other banks that have been bailed out because of direct exposure to subprime mortgages, Northern Rock was the first to fall victim directly to the global credit squeeze, because it relied heavily on raising money in the capital markets.
 Shares in Northern Rock slumped 36 percent Monday, to a seven-year low, dragging European banking stocks lower across the board as jittery investors began scrutinizing banks to determine which ones might have a similar business model.
 Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley, two Northern Rock rivals that also tap the capital markets, fell 31 percent and 15 percent respectively. Large financial institutions, including HSBC Holdings, Societe Generale of France and Deutsche Bank of Germany also declined, leading a 1.5 percent drop of the European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index. The FTSE 100 in Britain fell 1.7 percent, and the CAC 40 in France fell 1.8 percent. 
 The overnight rate that British banks charge to lend pounds to one another soared 60 basis points on Monday, to 6.47 percent, the highest level in more than a month, according to the British Bankers' Association.
 Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch cut their earnings estimates for several European banks Monday, including Northern Rock. Credit Suisse and Merrill said the bank was likely to be bought.
 ''We think the game is over for Northern Rock in its present form,'' a Merrill analyst, John-Paul Crutchley, wrote in a note to investors.
 The sight of hundreds of Britons lining up to make withdrawals after the unexpected and speedy decline of Northern Rock has also prompted questions about whether the robust British economy -- supported in large part by a heated housing market -- would suffer in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. The pound fell below $2 for the first time in nearly three weeks.
 Some economists said that the Northern Rock experience could dent consumer confidence and eventually have an effect on British economic growth.
 Members of Britain's opposition Conservative Party said Monday that Prime Minister Gordon Brown had ignored warnings of a ''looming debt crisis'' for the last four years when he was chancellor of the Exchequer and that he had encouraged consumers to take on record debt.
 In recent years, British mortgage lenders began offering loans exceeding the value of the properties on which they were based. The easy availability of credit helped prop up property prices and fueled speculation in the real estate market.
 Mervyn A. King, the head of the Bank of England, also came under pressure to explain why the bank bailed out Northern Rock only days after refusing to inject liquidity into financial markets on the ground that such action encouraged ''excessive risk-taking.''
 Northern Rock opened at 8 a.m. Monday, one hour earlier than usual, to deal with the expected wave of withdrawals. It had to increase the bandwidth on its Web site, which had struggled with the volume of people trying to get access.
 Patricia Carlton, a retiree who joined the line at noon Monday at a Northern Rock branch in London, said she decided to withdraw her money after watching the morning news and seeing lines forming at the bank branches.
 ''I hate to take out the money, but I just don't want to risk anything,'' she said, adding that she did not yet know what she would do with it.

HEADLINE: Some Toy Makers Shun the China Label

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and IVAR EKMAN. 
Mark Landler reported from Frankfurt and Ivar Ekman from Stockholm.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Sept. 17 

 BODY:
Playmobil of Germany has long promoted its colorful plastic pirates, firefighters and farm animals as better-than-your-average plaything -- toys to be handed down rather than chewed up. Now it can add another selling point: they are made in Europe, not China.
 The same goes for Lego, the Danish maker of toy bricks, and for Ravensburger, a German puzzle and game manufacturer, though it does produce small quantities of nonpaper toys in Chinese factories.
 With Mattel and the American toy industry reeling from recalls of millions of Chinese-made toys, most because of lead paint, some of Europe's best-known toy makers find themselves in the fortuitous position of having bucked an industrywide trend of moving production to China.
 ''Looking back, it feels like it was right to make that decision,'' said Andrea Schauer, managing director of Geobra Brandstatter, which makes Playmobil toys. ''At the level of quality we need,'' she said, ''we didn't have enough manpower to inspect factories in China.'' 
 With parents fretting about the safety hazards of toy cars and trains and Barbie accessories, the not-made-in-China label could prove to be a boon to these European toy makers, particularly in their domestic markets, where the corner toy store has not yet been elbowed out by retailing giants like Wal-Mart or Toy ''R'' Us. ''A lot of the sales still rely on the expertise of the guy whom I call Fritz,'' said Sean McGowan, a toy industry analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities in New York. ''To the extent that parents are at all concerned about this, Fritz is going to steer them toward Lego and Playmobil.''
 Even in the United States, analysts say, there could be a modest bounce for toys not made in China, be they European or American, if parents take the time to look at labels during the coming holiday shopping season. The drawback, some worry, is that consumers might spurn toys altogether.
 ''When parents say, 'My kid wants a cars toy or Thomas the train,' are they going to look at where it was made?'' asked Tim Conder, a toy analyst with A. G. Edwards & Sons. ''Or are they just going to say, 'I'm not going to buy it?' ''
 Steering clear of China was not an easy choice for Playmobil or Lego. Other European manufacturers, like Brio of Sweden, which produces wooden toys, have moved the bulk of their production to China. About 80 percent of all toys sold in the United States are made there. 
 For those who remained in Europe, the decision to keep most manufacturing there was driven more by economics than safety concerns, though the difficulty of controlling quality in far-away factories was also a factor.
 ''We looked at various options,'' said Iqbal Padda, executive vice president in charge of the global supply chain at Lego, noting that at the start, it was widely accepted ''that it has to be China.''
 Ms. Schauer said Playmobil, a family-owned company in Zirndorf, Germany, faced intense pressure to move production to China. Most of the industry was moving there, she said, and German banks did not want to lend money to companies to build toy factories at home.
 What the companies discovered, though, was while China's unit labor costs were a fraction of those in the West -- the equivalent of $1.50 an hour compared with $30 an hour in western Germany -- the distance between China and the companies' biggest markets eroded some of that cost advantage.
 In addition, Lego and Playmobil need to respond quickly to fickle consumer demand. To ramp up the production of a surprise hit -- a Playmobil World Cup soccer player, for example -- would be costly in China, where factories are set up to churn out vast volumes of toys with long lead times.
 ''Toys are not the fashion business, but they are like the fashion business,'' Mr. Padda said. ''The need to be able to react to what is going on in the market made us choose'' Europe.
 Today, Lego makes 65 to 70 percent of its bricks at a high-technology factory near its headquarters in Billund, Denmark. To save money, the company, which has struggled in recent years, is shifting production to two plants in Hungary run by Flextronics, a Singapore-based electronics manufacturer. A new Flextronics plant will open in Juarez, Mexico, this fall.
 Less than 3 percent of Lego's production comes from China, and it has no plans to set up a factory there.
 Ravensburger said it produces 85 percent of its toys in its home factory in Germany and a company-owned plant in the Czech Republic. ''In-house production,'' it said, ''provides the best possible quality control for us.''
 Playmobil, a third the size of Lego and a tenth that of Mattel, has also resisted outsourcing, except for a few electronic parts, like the flashing light atop its police car, which is made in China. In addition to a flagship factory near its Bavarian headquarters, it owns two plants in Malta and the Czech Republic.
 Sales of Playmobil toys are growing at a double-digit rate, Ms. Schauer said. In a twist, it plans to export its European-made toys to Chinese cities like Shanghai and Beijing next year.
 Still, Playmobil and its European rivals are not about to gloat over Mattel's misfortune. 
 ''We don't want to throw stones, in case we're sitting in a glass house,'' said Ms. Schauer, whose company last had a recall in the United States in 1982, involving toys made by an American contractor.
 Playmobil's medieval knights and Roman warriors are coated with shiny paint -- brilliant reds, jaunty yellows and such -- which Ms. Schauer said contained lead, albeit well below levels hazardous to children. To ensure the safety of its coating process, she said, Playmobil kept close watch over its manufacturing process.
 It is clear that Europeans trust Chinese contractors less than their own employees.
 In a statement on Playmobil's Web site, its founder, Horst Brandstatter, said, ''Outstanding quality can only be reached when production is carried out under one's own eyes, by people who have developed brand awareness over a long time, and learned to produce the highest quality.''
 As Ms. Schauer put it: ''You cannot blindly believe in German manufacturing. But when you are so close to the factory, you can jump in your car and be there in 20 minutes.''
 Not all Europeans agree that factories need to be nearby. Brio, based in Malmo, Sweden, moved the bulk of its production to China in 2004 after it passed from family ownership to a Swedish investment firm. But the chief executive, Thomas Brautigam, said the company exerted rigorous quality control over its three factories in Guangdong Province.
 ''We checked every single paint jar when this happened, but found no problems,'' he said, referring to the Mattel lead recall.
 Brio, Mr. Brautigam said, adhered to stricter quality standards than the industry norm and chose Chinese partners that abided by those standards, even if it meant forgoing the lowest-cost option.
 ''Most people are aware that you can't judge everything that comes out of China the same way,'' he said. ''It would mean that 85 percent of all toys have problems, which is absurd.''

HEADLINE: Building a Dam in a Bid To End Afghan Instability

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: KAJAKI DAM, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
The police posts on the hilltops around Kajaki Dam look out over empty villages and a deserted bazaar, where weeds grow and rubbish blows down the street. The population left a year and a half ago and only a few hundred people remain here, most of them soldiers and police officers guarding Afghanistan's jewel of industry, its largest hydroelectric dam, against Taliban insurgents.
 The Taliban are dug in a few miles beyond in otherwise deserted villages and have cut off all access roads, holding this tiny community in a stranglehold. British troops, here for the last eight months, have held them back, but only enough to create a security bubble some four miles in diameter around the dam. 
 This is where the United States government plans its largest project in Afghanistan, the repair and upgrade of the half-century-old dam, which American officials say will cost $150 million during its first year and up to $500 million in total. The project will include the construction of a 55-mile road to the dam through Taliban-held country, the installation of an additional turbine and the building of new transmission lines and substations to bring electricity to 1.7 million people in southern Afghanistan. American officials say more than 4,000 jobs will be created at the height of construction.
 An ambitious project, considering that Kajaki lies in northern Helmand province -- the most problematic of all Afghanistan's provinces, with uncontrolled poppy cultivation and at least half the land under the control of Taliban insurgents, drug lords and smugglers. Heavy fighting between insurgents and American and NATO forces occurs daily. 
 Yet for those very reasons, the United States Agency for International Development, the government agency coordinating American aid projects in Afghanistan, is focusing on Helmand like no other province. Alongside plans for the Kajaki Dam, it is supporting agricultural, educational and health programs in an attempt to wean farmers off poppy cultivation and workers away from fighting.
 ''We are developing a strategy as if Helmand were a country,'' said a Usaid official, who did not wish to be identified, citing agency policy. ''If Helmand was a country, it would be the fifth largest Usaid country project in the world,'' he said. 
 Yet the violence in Helmand, which escalated last year as the Taliban swarmed in while British troops were deploying to the province, has already delayed work on the Kajaki Dam for a year. Even if the situation improves enough to start work on the road in the coming months, the installation of a new turbine, which is too heavy to be airlifted and has to be trucked in, and new transmission lines will not be completed until the end of 2008.
 In the tiny community of British soldiers and local police officers and security guards living at Kajaki, that is unbearably far off. They live in limbo, cut off from normal life, unable to travel far beyond the camp or the deserted bazaar for fear of the Taliban. The policemen have not had relief or seen their families in more than a year and a half and went unpaid until recently.
 Some foreign assistance did come to Kajaki after the fall of the Taliban in 2001, Afghan engineers at the dam said. Germans repaired one of the two American Westinghouse turbines installed at the dam in 1975, bringing it back up to its full 18-megawatt capacity. A Chinese company was to begin work on a new turbine. Indians repaired a crane in the power station at the base of the 300-foot-high dam, and Americans built housing for foreign workers and hired guards. 
 But when the Taliban moved into the area last year and rained rockets down on the camp, the foreigners pulled out, and many Afghan civilians left as well. The foreigners' promises of development, including a clinic, a school and roads, evaporated.
 ''People are thinking they are not serious,'' said Muhammad Zaman, 43, the engineer on duty at the power station one afternoon. ''It is six years they are promising,'' he said. 
 Yet the power station workers -- 43 workers on 24-hour shifts -- keep coming to work from nearby villages and have managed to persuade the Taliban to let them cross the front line.
 ''We always talk to the Taliban and tell them this is an important project -- it will bring more electricity and save on oil, power, and will save water,'' Mr. Zaman said. ''To some extent they agree, but there are some who come from Pakistan, and they are saying that the project should not go forward.'' 
 The Taliban leadership is widely believed to be operating out of the city of Quetta in Pakistan and has sought to disrupt assistance programs and prevent people from cooperating with the government and foreign forces.
 The civilians of the Kajaki area are suffering the most from the standoff, driven from their homes and unable to farm their fields, the workers said. 
 ''I am worried about the villagers,'' said Haji Abdul Razziq, the district chief. ''They are poor and now they are scattered in the desert, living under trees and bushes, beneath the mountains. They are in a very bad situation, between life and death. Seven children have died from the severe heat.'' 
 Mr. Abdul Razziq said that an old man had come to see him and told him he was going around begging at night because he was so ashamed to be seen.
 The winter would be worse for the 600 families who have been displaced from their homes south of the camp, he warned. Hundreds more have left villages to the north. 
 ''The only way to help them is to clear the Taliban away completely from the area, then you can help the people,'' Mr. Abdul Razziq said. ''At the moment the enemy has become so weak, they just need a slight push.'' 
 Yet when British troops conducted a patrol to the village of Mazdurak, just a few miles to the north, they came under fire from three directions and had to call in a deafening barrage of artillery and air support to knock the Taliban out. 
 There will be little relief for the displaced families in the coming months, let alone progress on the dam, British soldiers warned. So far, their orders are only to preserve the four-mile buffer zone while the bulk of British forces in Helmand concentrate on areas farther south.
 ''It's a huge undertaking to build and secure a route to get equipment in,'' said Maj. Tony Borgnis, a company commander with the Royal Anglian Regiment, which has been fighting the Taliban farther south for the last five months. ''I cannot see it happening in my tenure,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Effort to Get Companies To Disclose Climate Risk

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
Two environmental groups and the financial officers of 10 states and New York City are asking the Securities and Exchange Commission to require companies to disclose the risks that climate change may pose to their bottom lines. The petition is expected to reach the S.E.C. today, representatives of the groups said.
 The action by Ceres, a coalition of environmental activists and investors, along with Environmental Defense and investors managing $1.5 trillion in assets is the second in recent days to focus attention on the potential impact on Wall Street of climate change. 
 On Friday, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York started an investigation of five energy companies to determine if they had adequately disclosed any financial risk they might face from their ownership stake or operations of coal-fired power plants. Scientists believe that carbon dioxide, the main emission from these plants, is a leading cause of recent global warming.
 Mindy S. Lubber, president of Ceres, said in an interview, ''We need this because right now more than half of the S.& P. 500 are not disclosing their climate risk, which we would consider a material risk in this day and age.'' 
 A fact sheet prepared by Ceres and Environmental Defense said that regional, state and local initiatives to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions now apply in areas representing 58 percent of the country's gross domestic product and 54 percent of its population.
 The fact sheet also said that Allstate, one of the country's leading insurers, ''did not mention climate change, global warming greenhouse gases or carbon dioxide'' in its most recent annual report. 
 Rich Halberg, a spokesman for Allstate, said he was puzzled by that statement. ''The very first risk factor we report on Page 1 are significant losses we may face from catastrophes and severe weather,'' he said. He added that the company's social responsibility report, issued separately from the annual report, deals with climate issues.
 Ceres has pushed the question of corporate financial disclosure of climate risk, usually in the context of shareholder resolutions, for about five years. This week's escalation comes as the Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress try to fine-tune a legislative approach to energy and climate-change issues.
 Joel Seligman, an expert on securities law who is also president of the University of Rochester, wondered whether the agency really needed to cast a wider net in its financial disclosure requirements. 
 But he also noted that the need to account for material environmental risks, even those that are not easily quantifiable, has long been recognized in the context of the Superfund law, which left companies potentially liable for hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of cleanup costs for toxic contamination.
 Ms. Lubber of Ceres, when asked if it was possible to quantify a risk that might arise from federal legislation that remains unapproved, echoed that point: ''You don't have to put an exact number on it. If federal regulation puts a cap on carbon, it means businesses will have to change their technology, maybe buy new equipment. It needs to be noted.''
 Aside from Ceres and Environmental Defense, the petition was joined by Mr. Cuomo and the comptrollers of New York State and New York City; the California state comptroller and the huge California state government and teachers' pension funds; and Florida's chief financial officer.
 Others involved included financial officials from North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, Rhode Island and Maine, and the New Jersey State Investment Council.

HEADLINE: States Differ Widely in Spending On Health Care, Study Finds

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17 

 BODY:
A new federal study shows huge variations in personal health spending among states, ranging from an average of nearly $6,700 a person in Massachusetts to less than $4,000 in Utah. 
 The study, published on Monday in the Web edition of the journal Health Affairs, said that Massachusetts, Maine, New York, Alaska and Connecticut had the highest per capita spending on health care in 2004. 
 The lowest-spending states were Utah, Arizona, Idaho, New Mexico and Nevada. Per capita spending in Utah was 59 percent of that in Massachusetts.
 Anne B. Martin, an economist at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services who was the main author of the report, said the reasons for the differences included the age and incomes of the population, the concentration of doctors in a state, the generosity of public programs, the extent of private health insurance coverage and the mix of services used by state residents.
 Health policy experts have also observed that doctors differ in ''styles of practice,'' including the use of specialists.
 In some states with high levels of per capita health spending, the federal researchers said, people ''receive more comprehensive employer-based health insurance benefit packages.'' 
 The researchers noted differences among states with the highest health spending. Massachusetts, for example, has higher per capita spending on hospital care than any other state, while Maine spends more than other states on home and community-based care. Maine had the second highest level of spending on doctors' services, after Alaska. 
 Utah had the lowest per capita spending on doctors and hospitals. 
 Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University, said, ''The variations help explain why some states can achieve health care reform on their own, without a huge infusion of federal money, while others cannot.''
 ''In a low-spending state like New Mexico, you have less money in the health care system that can be recaptured and invested in coverage for the uninsured,'' she said. ''In a high-spending state like Massachusetts, the health care system has the resources to subsidize coverage of the uninsured.''
 Experts said, higher spending per capita did not necessarily mean better care.
 ''States that spend more per capita often have a lower quality of care,'' said Karen Davis, a health economist who is president of the Commonwealth Fund.

HEADLINE: Moving Downtown: AOL Seeks New Image

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
IT'S not a literal move to Madison Avenue, but it's close.
 AOL will shift its headquarters from its large technology campus in Dulles, Va., to downtown New York City next spring, as the struggling online company tries to retool itself as an advertising specialist and compete with the likes of Google, Yahoo and Microsoft.
 The change, announced yesterday, speaks to how much the digital world has evolved since America Online emerged in the 1990s as a dominant Internet provider, selling dial-up connections to millions of households and introducing many people to e-mail.
 Over the last year, AOL has been buying up advertising technology companies in a race to reinvent itself and prove its worth to its parent company, Time Warner. Yesterday AOL said it would base all advertising sales in a division called Platform A that will be run from the new headquarters at 770 Broadway, just south of Union Square. 
 In another significant change, the group will be led by Curtis G. Viebranz, the former chief executive of Tacoda, a company AOL acquired in July for a reported $275 million. Tacoda's expertise is in behavioral advertising, where specific ads are presented to people based on the Web sites they have visited and other personalized factors. Mr. Viebranz will oversee ad sales on AOL's branded Web site and on thousands of publishers' sites across the Internet.
 Michael J. Kelly, president of AOL Media Networks, will leave AOL after Platform A is up and running, the company said. Mr. Kelly, a longtime Time Warner executive who was publisher of Entertainment Weekly magazine in the late 1990s, was brought in to head ad sales at AOL in 2004.
 The last several years have been rocky for AOL as its core base of subscribers has shifted to high-speed Internet connections and started spending more time on sites like YouTube and MySpace. Now, as consumer brand companies are shifting more of their advertising budgets online, AOL is trying to play catch-up.
 ''AOL's leadership in this space was theirs to lose years ago, and they did lose it,'' said Shar VanBoskirk, an analyst at Forrester Research. ''This move is a great one, but my concern is: is it too little too late?''
 AOL has been cultivating a more advertising-oriented business model since 2004, when it purchased Advertising.com, a network that resells space on sites across the Web. Last year, in an abandonment of the subscription strategy, AOL announced it would make its Web portal and e-mail service free. More recently the company has set up portals in countries like Italy and India, with plans to introduce 14 more foreign portals soon.
 But in the minds of many advertising executives, AOL has lagged Google, Yahoo and Microsoft -- a perception that the move to New York could help change.
 ''If you're going to be in the advertising business, you have to be in New York because that's where all the agencies are, that's where all of the media money is controlled, on Madison Avenue,'' said Randy Falco, chairman and chief executive of AOL. ''I think you're going to see more and more brand advertisers moving onto the Web through Platform A.''
 This year, AOL and its competitors have been engaged in a virtual land grab for advertising technology companies, with Google's $3.1 billion deal for DoubleClick perhaps setting the pace. AOL has bought not only Tacoda but also Lightningcast (an online video company) and Third Screen Media (which sells ads on cellphones). 
 Like many of the changes, the move to New York represents a further shift away from AOL's roots, and analysts said it could portend job layoffs for some of the 4,000 employees based in Northern Virginia. 
 In 2000, AOL was so hot and high-flying that it sewed up a deal for the old-line media company Time Warner. But not long after the merger closed in 2001, the AOL subscription-service revenue model started growing stale. 
 Since then, Time Warner has repeatedly backed away from AOL's leadership, removing AOL's name from the parent company in 2002 after large losses. Time Warner also owns Time Warner Cable, Turner Broadcasting and Time Inc., the publisher of magazines like Time and People.
 In recent weeks, analysts have said Time Warner could realize more shareholder value if it were split up, with AOL severed from the other units. Evaluating such a break-up will probably be one of the first challenges that Jeffrey L. Bewkes, Time Warner's president and chief operating officer, will face if he succeeds Richard D. Parsons as Time Warner's chief executive this fall, as is widely expected.
 AOL executives put a good face on the move to New York, which is certain to be disruptive at the Dulles complex, which includes six buildings and about 1 million square feet. AOL executives did not say how many employees will move from Virginia to the new office in New York. 
 ''In terms of moving the headquarters, I think it is just a little bit odd,'' said Richard S. Greenfield, an analyst at Pali Research, who advocates the break-up of Time Warner. ''You're moving executive management further and further away from the core operating business of AOL at a point in time when they are at critical juncture.''
 In an interview, AOL executives said they saw the company's future advertising revenues coming not only from the AOL Web site but also from thousands of publishers' sites across the Internet that let AOL sell ads on their pages. 
 AOL will use technology from Tacoda to capture data about consumers' Web surfing, and use the information to deliver targeted ads to people each time they log on. AOL will also use the data to sell ads through Advertising.com, which delivers ads to its own network of publisher sites.
 ''There's really been a shift in advertising to the network business,'' said Ron Grant, president of AOL. ''Portals aren't really big enough to meet the needs of advertisers.''
 Mr. Grant said that Platform A could be expanded to sell online and offline ads in one place.
 Advertising executives who buy space on AOL say it has made improvements this year. For example, it has started working directly with advertisers on content that features their products and runs on AOL's site.
 ''They've made themselves open to deals that they shied away from in the past,'' said Art Sindlinger, vice president and activation director at Starcom USA, an ad-buying agency in the Publicis Groupe. ''We're getting to talk with the folks who design the products where, in the past, you would get a package that was completely baked.''

HEADLINE: EUROPEAN COURT FAULTS MICROSOFT ON COMPETITION

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. O'BRIEN and STEVE LOHR; Kevin J. O'Brien reported from Luxembourg and Steve Lohr from New York.

DATELINE: LUXEMBOURG, Sept. 17 

 BODY:
Europe's second-highest court delivered a stinging rebuke to Microsoft Monday, but the impact of the decision upholding an earlier antitrust ruling may extend well beyond the world's largest software maker to other high-technology companies.
 Software and legal experts said the European ruling might signal problems for companies like Apple, Intel and Qualcomm, whose market dominance in online music downloads, computer chips and mobile phone technology is also being scrutinized by the European Commission.
 ''The decision is a strong endorsement for what in the United States would be considered aggressive policy on dominant firms,'' said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University. ''And that's going to continue to play out in other kinds of cases.''
 The 13-member European Court of First Instance, in a starkly worded 244-page summary, reaffirmed that Microsoft had abused its market power by adding a digital media player to Windows, undercutting the early leader, Real Networks. 
 It also ordered Microsoft to obey a March 2004 commission order to share confidential computer code with competitors. The court also upheld the record fine levied against the company, 497.2 million euros ($689.4 million).
 But the court decision comes as the center of gravity in computing is shifting away from the software for personal computers, Microsoft's stronghold. Increasingly, the e-mailing or word-processing functions of a computer can be performed with software delivered on a Web browser. Other devices like cellphones are now used as alternates to personal computers. 
 The real challenge to Microsoft, after more than a decade of dominating the technology industry, is coming not from the government, but from the marketplace. 
 The direct impact on Microsoft is small, said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. But there may be a longer-range consequence of having Microsoft under constant, open-ended scrutiny from Europe. 
 ''If you end up handicapping a major player in new markets, you may actually not enhance competition but hinder it, and help create new monopolies,'' Mr. Yoffie said. ''The obvious example is Google in Internet search and Apple in digital music.''
 Indeed, the Justice Department issued a statement expressing its concerns with the European decision, saying that tough restraints on powerful companies can be harmful. Thomas O. Barnett, assistant attorney general for the department's antitrust division, said that the effect ''rather than helping consumers, may have the unfortunate consequence of harming consumers by chilling innovation and discouraging competition.''
 Consumer welfare, not protecting competitors, should be the guiding standard in antitrust, Mr. Barnett said.
 Antitrust enforcement has often been criticized as too slow to grapple with fast-moving high-technology markets. Indeed, the media player market changed drastically during the years-long investigation in Europe. When the European Commission ordered Microsoft to offer a version of Windows in Europe without its media player, but at no difference in price, few people wanted the stripped-down version of Windows.
 Still, the Luxembourg court's ruling poses a threat to Microsoft's traditional way of doing business by bundling new features and products into its Windows operating system. The court decision sets a precedent, at least from Europe. For example, if Microsoft wants to put handwriting- and speech-recognition features or stronger security software into Windows, European authorities might listen to competitors' complaints. 
 In the United States, the Justice Department chose to settle the Microsoft antitrust case in 2001 without challenging the company's freedom to put whatever it wants in its operating system. 
 Microsoft's allies said the court's decision would have a chilling effect on the business strategies of many global technology companies. 
 ''This ruling is certainly going to introduce a lot of uncertainty,'' said Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology, a Washington-based group that supported Microsoft in its legal case in Europe. ''What the court is basically saying is that if you develop a successful product and get too big, the European Commission is going to force you to give away your intellectual property.''
 The European ruling's widest impact on technology companies, legal and industry experts say, will probably be on Microsoft's ability to guard some of its intellectual property in software for servers. Server software, running on data center computers, powers corporate networks and the Web. 
 The court upheld the commission's order that Microsoft must share technical information with competitors so their server software works smoothly with Microsoft's Windows desktop. 
 The order applies only to Europe, but Microsoft may have a difficult time containing the impact to the European market only. 
 Because the Internet runs on server software, industry analysts say the court's ruling could have a lasting impact. 
 ''The Internet has opened a really good door for the industry and society to walk through to enjoy a far more rapid pace of innovation and growth than in personal computing, where Microsoft controls things,'' said Timothy F. Bresnahan, an economist at Stanford University and a senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division during the Clinton administration. ''Europe is pushing to ensure that the higher pace of innovation on the server is allowed to continue.'' 
 Bradford L. Smith, the general counsel for Microsoft, who was present for the reading, said the company would follow the ruling but did not say specifically whether the company would appeal it. In a statement issued by the company, Mr. Smith said: ''I would note that a lot has changed since this case started in 1998. The world has changed, the industry has changed, and our company has changed.''
 The decision followed a five-day hearing on the issues under appeal in April 2006. Microsoft had indicated in the past that it would appeal any negative ruling to the European Court of Justice, the highest court in Europe. But an appeal by the company, a process likely to take at least two years, would focus only on whether the appellate court erred in procedure and points of law in reaching its decision, not on the facts in the case.
 Neelie Kroes, the European Union competition commissioner, said at a news conference in Brussels that while the decision set an ''important precedent,'' the judgment ''is bittersweet because the court has confirmed the commission's view that consumers are suffering at the hands of Microsoft.''
 In the course of the case, which began with a complaint in 1998, Ms. Kroes noted that Microsoft's share of the market in server software has risen sharply and that Windows Media Player has come to dominate the market. 
 She highlighted the fact that Microsoft has 95 percent of the world market for desktop operating systems and said she would like to see this shrink. ''You can't draw a line and say exactly 50 percent is correct, but a significant drop in market share is what we would like to see,'' she said. ''Microsoft cannot regulate the market by imposing its products and its services on people.''

HEADLINE: Paulson Cautions Against Rush to Regulation in Credit Crisis

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 17 

 BODY:
The United States Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., said Monday that turmoil in the world's financial markets could continue for some time. But he cautioned against the hasty introduction of regulations that could stymie innovation and slow economic growth. 
 Mr. Paulson, who met here with President Nicolas Sarkozy and France's finance minister, Christine Lagarde, said financial turbulence in the wake of the credit crisis this summer ''will be with us for a while,'' particularly in markets linked to subprime mortgages.
 He also warned that imposing new regulations could be counterproductive at a time when the global economy remains robust.
 ''The whole world and the U.S. have benefited from innovative financing techniques and innovation in terms of securitization and credit availability, and so we need to think this through carefully and don't rush to judgment and overreact,'' Mr. Paulson said. ''We have to get the balance right.''
 After his trip to Paris, Mr. Paulson met with Alistair Darling, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, in London, where he declared that the healthy economies of the United States and Britain should give investors confidence in dealing with turbulent market conditions.
 Asked whether it was a lack of regulation that precipitated the current market situation, he said, ''History says it's very difficult for policy to keep up with innovation.''
 Mr. Paulson also appeared to endorse Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French candidate to become the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Paulson said he already saw eye-to-eye with Mr. Strauss-Kahn over the need to change the I.M.F. so that it could play a continuing role in the global financial system. ''I am very positive on Dominique Strauss-Kahn,'' Mr. Paulson said, adding that he was ''a very strong candidate.''
 Mr. Paulson also said his visit to Paris was a sign of ''a new, very positive era of American and French relations.'' He praised President Sarkozy for undertaking regulatory changes aimed at creating jobs and increasing economic growth and said he was in frequent contact with Ms. Lagarde over economic questions.
 Ms. Lagarde, speaking later with reporters, said France and the United States were in complete agreement over the need to press China to do more to strengthen the value of its currency, the yuan.
 ''I think there is a total convergence of views on the imbalance of the values, particularly on the undervaluation of the yuan compared with European values and compared with American values,'' she said.

 BODY:
Gov. Deval Patrick announced a proposal on Monday to allow three resort-style casinos in Massachusetts. The revenues, he said, would help the commonwealth pay for road and bridge repair, and provide property tax relief to homeowners. 
 If the Legislature approves the plan, the casinos would be built in the metropolitan Boston region and in western and southeastern Massachusetts. Officials said they were expected to generate $400 million in annual revenue for the state and create 20,000 permanent jobs by 2012. 
 ''Casino gambling is neither a cure-all or the end of civilization,'' Mr. Patrick said at a news conference. ''On balance, however, and under certain conditions, I believe resort casinos can and will work well in and for the commonwealth.'' 
 Nationally, more and more states are turning to casinos as a source of revenue.
 In April, Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas signed a law allowing up to four state-owned resort-style casinos. In February, Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York approved plans for a $600 million casino in the Catskills to be run by the St. Regis Mohawk tribe. Last year Pennsylvania approved the construction of 11 slots-only casinos.
 Massachusetts' neighbor Connecticut has two of the most successful casinos in the nation, both run by Indian tribes.
 Under Mr. Patrick's plan, three 10-year licenses would be put up for bid, a process that officials expect to generate at least $600 million in revenue, some of which would be used to provide property tax credits. At least one license is likely be granted to an Indian tribe, Mr. Patrick said. 
 Mr. Patrick said the casinos would increase revenue, especially for transportation expenses, an area where the state expects to face a $15 billion to $19 billion gap by 2027.
 In the Legislature, the House speaker, Salvatore F. DiMasi, who has opposed expanded gambling in the past -- the state has racetracks and a lottery -- said he was concerned that the plan would change the landscape and culture of the state.
 ''We in the House remain skeptical,'' Mr. DiMasi said in a statement. ''But we will hear the governor out.'' 
 Opponents of casino gambling urged the Legislature to reject the proposal. 
 It is not ''good economic policy'' to increase the commonwealth's income at a cost that involves the personal well being of its citizens,'' said Daniel Avila of the Massachusetts Catholic Conference.
 Developers, towns, tribes and opponents of casinos had worked furiously in anticipation of Mr. Patrick's decision. The Mashpee Wampanoag tribe is proposing a $1 billion casino on land it owns in Middleborough. 
 The operator of the Mohegan Sun Casino in Connecticut have floated a plan to build a casino in Palmer in western Massachusetts. Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston supports a resort-style casino at the Suffolk Downs horse track.

HEADLINE: In Japan, Stagnation Wins Again

 BODY:
Inbamura, Japan
 SHINZO ABE, who stepped down as prime minister last week, is what we call in Japan an ''obocchan.'' An obocchan is a type of well-to-do, slightly spoiled child of a powerful family. Mr. Abe may have been an obocchan but, wanting to be liked by everyone, he made efforts to address the concerns of the working class. Yet despite his efforts, most Japanese felt that he was unaware of working-class issues, and that -- more than any political scandals the press has been crowing about -- may have been his undoing.
 More broadly, while most people liked Mr. Abe and believed him to be smart, the Japanese news media often called him ''Kuuki ga Yomenai'' or, for short, ''K. Y.'' ''Kuuki'' means ''air'' and ''yomenai'' means ''cannot read.'' Not being able to read the air means that you don't know that your guest wants another cup of tea or that you should be serving cold tea because it is a hot day. Reading the air is an essential trait for a Japanese politician. 
 This shortcoming put Mr. Abe at a severe disadvantage compared with his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi. Mr. Koizumi is famous not only for being the master of reading the air but also for his unmatched ability to ignore the advice of the political elite. I would call this the ''sonnano kankeinei'' style. The catchphrase of a popular Japanese comedian whose routine has spread widely on YouTube, sonnano kankeinei is a crude way of saying, ''So what? I don't care.'' It would be an uncommon attitude for a politician even in America, and in Japan was simply unprecedented.
 It was a tough act to follow, and Mr. Abe tried to read the air but ended up following too much advice and yielding to the various centers of power and special interests to which his Liberal Democratic Party has owed its 50-year near monopoly. The result, unsurprisingly, was wishy-washy, ineffective policy.
 For instance, he had the right idea in trying to shake up the government's stagnant bureaucracy. But instead of taking on a single group of bureaucrats in a winnable battle -- as Mr. Koizumi did when he pushed through a bill privatizing the postal system in 2005 -- Mr. Abe tried to change the broader fundamental laws governing federal agencies. The bureaucrats and their supporters in the Parliament turned on him, and he was stuck in a fight he couldn't win. Very K. Y.
 The biggest example of his weakness, however, came when the government lost the pension records of 50 million workers. In most countries, this would have caused a riot, if not a revolution. Although concerns over possible missing records spread among the public late last year, Mr. Abe did not act until the spring. 
 Many in the public felt he delayed because the government bureaucrats and business executives closest to him probably didn't know anyone who was affected by the mismanagement of the records. Possibly, but again I think his failure stemmed not from his insulation but from his crippling Kuuki ga Yomenai.
 These sorts of misjudgments, combined with the string of scandals resulted in the resignation of several cabinet members and the suicide of another, were what most pundits feel caused the Liberal Democrats' disastrous showing at the polls in July. To some extent that is true. But another huge factor that went to alienating voters was concerns over what the government and news media like to call Japan's current economic ''recovery.''
 The problem is that most Japanese know that the so-called recovery is fueled by exports to China, particularly construction materials and energy. The steel, cement and coal companies are prospering. Chinese money is filling the coffers of the industries that have fueled the political system since World War II and were a big part of the bubble collapse that has left the economy stagnant for more than a decade. 
 Chinese demand is pumping up the value of the large raw materials and construction companies, trading firms with positions in commodities like coal, and businesses that sell overseas. But most domestic companies are seeing only an increase in their raw material costs without a significant increase in demand or margins locally. 
 Most of this money is viewed as sloshing around in the markets and the bank accounts of the elite, with very little trickling down to small companies or the average salaryman. One of my favorite indicators of the word on the street is the Tokyo taxi drivers, and when I bring up the subject, every one asks me something along the lines of, ''Why do they keep saying that our economy has recovered?''
 The other problem with this ''recovery'' is that it reinforces the old stereotype that Japan's strength lies in construction and exports. While this was a good strategy for the postwar recovery, it now slows down reform and diverts valuable human and public resources from the stunted service and high-tech industries that Japan needs for long-term growth. 
 It's no coincidence that before he entered politics, Mr. Abe was an executive at Kobe Steel. And his successor will be more of the same: the two contenders for his job both have backgrounds in raw materials. Taro Aso's family company is one of the largest mining and cement concerns in Japan, and Yusuo Fukuda's business experience is in oil.
 This reflects a fundamental problem with Japanese politics. In a policy supported in part by the American fear of the threat of communism, the conservative Liberal Democrats stamped out all liberal resistance by either destroying the careers of members of the opposition or co-opting them. This resulted in a single-party system, with disputes negotiated and settled within the Liberal Democratic Party though a complicated process of factions and committees. 
 Many Japanese called this a ''democracy in democracy.'' Perhaps, but this democracy in democracy was only visible to those in power and is managed mostly through a system of pork-barrel politics.
 In July, the people had had enough and voted against the ruling party, but the result could be even worse. In deposing Mr. Abe, who despite being part of an old political family was still something of an outsider, they will see a return of the Liberal Democrats' old guard.
 Nor is the opposition any better. The leader of the Democratic Party of Japan is Ichiro Ozawa, a student of Kakuei Tanaka, the prime minister who in the 1970s fashioned a public-funds-for-votes system and ''rebuilt'' Japan by paving the countryside with concrete. 
 Perhaps there is a silver lining: the weakness of the Liberal Democrats may give us the first sustained period of two-party politics since 1955. If so, the real question is whether it will allow any fresh blood in the political system. 
 Unfortunately, Japanese politics is a time-consuming and thankless task. Young entrepreneurial types shun public service. Mr. Koizumi made a serious effort to get people from outside the old party to run, but most of those young politicians have already dropped out. (I've rejected entreaties by both parties to run for office and have no regrets; according to my friends in junior positions in the Liberal Democratic Party, their first years have been spent in minor working groups, never being allowed to speak up at or attend any meetings of importance.)
 The heart of the problem is that true multiparty politics should have started in Japan decades ago. Soon the members of our own postwar baby boom will be retiring. The looming crisis of a bankrupt Japan, a overburdened pension system and a corporate ecology of pumped-up old-economy companies will be upon us. 
 The man on the street knows this, but in a country that boasts of never having had a successful revolt of the people, or even a popular uprising resulting in significant reforms, it's unlikely that such awareness will be enough to punch through the K. Y. elite and make things change. 
 Maybe it's time for a revolution.

HEADLINE: Wary of Past, Clinton Unveils A Health Plan

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY and ROBIN TONER. 
Patrick Healy reported from Des Moines, and Robin Toner from Washington.

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Sept. 17 

 BODY:
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton unveiled a plan on Monday to guarantee health insurance to all Americans, but in a way carefully designed to avoid the political flaws in her failed proposal of 1993-94.
 Mrs. Clinton promised to cover everyone without big new bureaucracies, without a complicated reorganization of one-seventh of the American economy and without affecting people who are insured and happy with their coverage -- all features that helped doom the Clinton administration's plan 14 years ago.
 In what her advisers hoped would be the final stage of a long political rehabilitation on the issue, Mrs. Clinton told her audience here that she had been scarred by the old battle but had gained some valuable lessons.
 ''I learned that people who are satisfied with their current coverage want assurances that they can keep it,'' she said. ''Part of our health care system is the best in the world, and we should build on it; part of the system is broken, and we should fix it.'' 
 Like the plans put forth by former Senator John Edwards and Senator Barack Obama, her chief rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, Mrs. Clinton's proposal would try to strengthen and build on the existing, employer-based system, through which most Americans under 65 already receive their coverage. She would create new options for buying private or public insurance at affordable rates, require everyone to obtain insurance, and provide subsidies and tax credits to small businesses and individuals who could not afford it.
 The plan, with an estimated cost of $110 billion a year, would be financed largely by rolling back President Bush's tax cuts for Americans making over $250,000 a year and by savings in the health care system.
 The title of Mrs. Clinton's proposal sums up her carefully calibrated new approach: ''The American Health Choices Plan.'' It is clearly aimed at the middle-class Americans who feared that her earlier plan would limit their choices, force them into health maintenance organizations and subject them to new government bureaucracies deciding what their benefits could be -- concerns stoked by a devastating campaign by insurers.
 Mrs. Clinton's Republican rivals instantly denounced her new proposal as another exercise in ''Hillarycare,'' with Mitt Romney declaring that she ''takes her inspiration from European bureaucracies'' and ''fundamentally does not believe in markets and in the states.'' Mr. Romney, who as governor of Massachusetts himself signed into law a measure requiring all residents of his state to sign up for health insurance, and other Republican candidates acknowledge problems in the health care system but would rely more than Mrs. Clinton and the other Democrats on the market, the states and tax credits to resolve them.
 A variety of health policy analysts, however, said the change between Clinton 1 and Clinton 2 was striking. The first plan, for example, would have required people and employers to join new ''regional alliances'' to purchase coverage. It would have tried to control total health spending through a complicated system of managed competition, and would have created a National Health Board with sweeping authority to regulate that system. 
 In addition, employers would have been required to provide coverage to their workers. This time Mrs. Clinton would create tax incentives to help small businesses with the cost of coverage, but would not require them to offer it.
 The new plan, said Stuart Altman, a health economist at Brandeis University who has been a policy adviser since the Nixon administration, ''is much less radical: it's not fair at all to say it's a redo of the old plan.''
 Even so, Mrs. Clinton took pains to warn her audience -- medical professionals and patients at a hospital in Des Moines -- that attacks were coming.
 ''Don't let them fool us again,'' she said of her Republican opponents. ''This is not government-run: There will be no new bureaucracy. You can keep the doctors you know and trust. You keep the insurance you have, if you like that. But this plan expands personal choice and keeps costs down.''
 Still, while Mrs. Clinton and her aides emphasized that her plan would not create any new federal agencies, a senior adviser did acknowledge that the government would need more workers to oversee the expanded options. It is too early to say how many workers, or at what cost, the adviser said.
 The candidate and her aides also underscored that her plan was a broad outline, that it would change in the political process and that she was keenly aware of a need to build consensus. 
 A CBS News poll released Monday night suggests that Mrs. Clinton has already turned the health care issue from a liability to an asset, at least among Democratic primary voters: 61 percent said they had confidence in her ability to make the right decisions on health care, compared with 42 percent who felt that way about Mr. Obama, and 39 percent about Mr. Edwards. The survey also found that few voters held her responsible for the failure to pass universal health insurance during her husband's presidency.
 In fact, Mrs. Clinton's organization waited until now to unveil her final health care plan because her advisers wanted a chance to reintroduce her to the country and build up her ratings.
 ''We needed to take time for people to get to know her better and to see that she has very good intentions,'' one adviser said, ''before we asked them to consider trusting her with health care again.''
 Despite their broad policy agreements with her, both of Mrs. Clinton's major Democratic rivals sought to highlight differences on Monday, relying in large part on the negative elements of her history on the issue. Mr. Obama said the key to achieving universal health care was ''the ability to bring people together in an open, transparent process that builds a broad consensus for change.'' Mrs. Clinton's handling of the health care issue in 1993-94 was widely faulted for its secretive nature, resulting in a 1,342-page plan that offered little room for compromise.
 In Mrs. Clinton's speech on Monday and in policy briefings afterward, her camp emphasized that many of the powerful interest groups around health care -- including business, labor, consumer advocates and hospitals -- had begun to seek common ground as the number of uninsured approaches 50 million. But even as Mr. Edwards sought to portray her as insufficiently independent of special interests, Mrs. Clinton said she would not shrink from a fight with drug and insurance companies.
 She said she would put new regulations on the insurance industry, ''eliminating discrimination'' against those with health problems. Doing so, she acknowledged, will not make her the industry's ''woman of the year.''

HEADLINE: Hillary Clinton, From Revolution to Evolution

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Health care reform isn't only about covering the uninsured. It's about reorganizing one-seventh of the U.S. economy. It's the issue that will redefine the role of government in the 21st century. So when I spoke with Hillary Clinton yesterday, I asked what her newly unveiled plan revealed about her political philosophy.
 The word she kept coming back to was ''partnerships.'' She described an array of different social entities -- individuals, the federal government, insurance companies, doctors and hospitals -- coming together and exercising shared responsibility for creating a better system. 
 It began to sound like a health care loya jirga -- indicative of the political vision that has marked so much of her thinking over the years. When some politicians are asked to describe systems that really work, they think of the competitive marketplace. Others think of political combat -- good defeating evil. But Clinton, at her most hopeful moments, is a communitarian. When she's asked to describe a system that works, she describes diverse people coming together around a big table to reach a consensus. 
 That's the sort of national community her plan is supposed to foster and that's the sort of process she used to create it. Clinton is hard to interview because her answers are often just chunks of her stump speeches, but I thought I detected real warmth when she described the way she and her staff came up with the plan. 
 ''It was an exhilarating process!'' she enthused, describing how all sorts of different people came together to talk through issues. ''There were countless meetings,'' she remembered fondly, ''with business leaders who were surprised to find themselves sitting next to me'' and a long parade of academics, nurses, experts and friends.
 As she spoke, memories of the Clinton years wafted through my head -- government by seminar running into the late hours. But as she will tell you (before you even have a chance to ask), she has learned a lot since the early 1990s, and while the conversations may still be endless, they are also more restrained.
 And it's true. The plan she unveiled yesterday is much simpler than the one she came up with 14 years ago. Back then, she and her staff were like technocratic engineers, one of her advisers told me, trying to patch every last gap in their edifice. This time they were content to leave the details of the plan to Congress.
 Last time, they threatened people who were satisfied with their health coverage. This time they reassure them that nothing will change. Last time, they were out of touch with the American values of choice and individual freedom. This time they emphasize those values every chance they get, never seriously considering a Canadian-style single-payer system.
 This time the change is evolutionary, not revolutionary. The private insurance/employer-based system will still remain the heart and soul of the social contract -- it's just that more people will be given tax credits so they can afford to buy in.
 The Clinton plan makes life politically difficult for Mitt Romney. She relies on an individual insurance mandate. So does his plan in Massachusetts. The Clinton plan also takes the brave step of taxing the wealthy for gold-plated health care benefits -- a reform that almost every Republican health expert endorses. Meanwhile, the plan seems to have driven John Edwards around the bend. The statement he issued yesterday qualifies as the shrillest statement issued by a major presidential candidate this year. 
 But the Clinton plan does have the weaknesses of the communitarian approach. She creates a magic circle of companies, providers, government entities, all interlocked in a system to provide health security. But there will still be forces outside the magic circle that will be adapting and innovating in ways that might upset the plan.
 First, there will be state governments. One of the virtues of welfare reform is that while the national government set certain goals, it was up to the states to innovate and compete to reach them. Clinton says she's not averse to creative solutions from the states, but she doubts that they'll be able to lead the way since they rely on money from Washington. Hers is not a decentralized, federal approach.
 Then, there are the insurance companies, the designated betes noires of her plan. They are commanded to insure everybody, but they'll probably be extremely creative in finding ways to not insure high-risk people who will cost them money. 
 Then there are patients. The Clinton plan aims to lower health care costs through a variety of measures. But if the cost of an M.R.I. comes down, people will just want more of them. Americans spend more on computers as those machines get more efficient.
 Finally, there is posterity. Our children face a gigantic tidal wave of debt as a result of our current health care system. If health care reform doesn't fundamentally adjust benefits while using available tax increases to help the uninsured, then the system will still be unaffordable in the long run.
 Hillary Clinton's health care plan is a huge step forward from 1993. It's better than the G.O.P. candidates' plans (which don't exist). But there are still complexities in the health care system that no loya jirga, no matter how smart, can fully anticipate and control.

HEADLINE: Obama Urges Wall Street To Protect the Middle Class

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama chastised Wall Street executives yesterday as failing to protect middle-class interests and called for increased federal oversight of credit rating agencies, including a government investigation. 
 In an appearance at Nasdaq offices in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Obama, a Democratic presidential candidate, praised America's free-market impulse but lamented what he characterized as its recent toll on the middle class.
 Some workers, he said, ''now compete with their teenagers for minimum-wage jobs at Wal-Mart because their factory moved overseas,'' and he described this summer's subprime lending crisis as a case study of greed among mortgage lenders and the agencies that provide information about them.
 ''Our free market was never meant to be a free license to take whatever you can get, however you can get it,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And so from time to time, we have put in place certain rules of the road to make competition fair and open and honest.''
 The speech came a day before the Federal Reserve is expected to reduce interest rates in response to strains on the economy growing in part out of a credit squeeze set off by problems in the mortgage market. With some analysts saying the risk of a recession is increasing, the economy and the financial markets are getting more attention from the crowded presidential field.
 Mr. Obama of Illinois called for regulatory efforts to increase transparency and accountability among financial companies. Mr. Obama zeroed in on the housing market, proposing tighter federal rules on mortgage fraud and government rating systems for mortgages and credit cards.
 ''If more Americans were armed with this kind of information before they purchased risky mortgage loans,'' he said, ''the current crisis might not have happened.'' 
 A spokesman for Mr. Obama, Bill Burton, said the proposed inquiry was inspired by a planned European Commission investigation into credit ratings practices in Europe. The inquiry, Mr. Burton said, would be spearheaded by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Mr. Obama made his remarks before an audience of Wall Street executives, a highly coveted prize in the presidential fund-raising game. He leads the other Democratic candidates in attracting donations from the securities and investment industry, recording more than $3.3 million in contributions through last quarter, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog group. (Only Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican, has received more money from the investment sector.)
 At the start of his talk, Mr. Obama described the early days of the Great Depression and cited the economic policy of a prominent presidential contender from the time: Franklin D. Roosevelt. The senator quickly softened the comparisons. ''We certainly do not face a test of the magnitude that Roosevelt's generation did,'' he said. ''But we are tested still.''

The Climate Debate
 To the Editor:
Re '''Feel Good' vs. 'Do Good' on Climate'' (Findings, Sept. 11): Bjorn Lomborg, the self-described skeptical environmentalist, is best taken with a healthy dose of his own medicine: skepticism. Global climate disruption from greenhouse gas pollution cannot be compared to the effects of New York City's urban heat island. 
 Economic models have shown that policies to cap and reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a minimal impact on economic growth. Instead, they will speed the development of new technologies. And most important, they will help prevent the potentially catastrophic climate changes that would truly add to human suffering and poverty. 
 W. L. Chameides Durham, N.C. The writer is dean of the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University.
 To the Editor:
 Despite the picture of polar bears in the desert that accompanied John Tierney's column, the article totally ignores the potential catastrophic effects of climate change on the world's ecosystems. The article would have us believe that the only dangers posed by climate change are the rise of a foot or two in sea level and a few more deaths on hot summer days. While it is true that no one knows exactly what global warming will bring, the potential risks are far more complex and serious and should not be oversimplified.
 Robert Stuart, M.D. Oakland, Calif.
 To the Editor:
 John Tierney writes only about human beings. Are we going to provide air conditioners to the polar bears et al., too?

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday as heavy withdrawals from the British bank Northern Rock reignited concern over the cost of credit and sent the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down for the first time in five days. 
 Citigroup, Bank of America and Merrill Lynch led declines among financial companies as traders also pared bets that the Federal Reserve, which is expected to cut its benchmark rate today, will cut it by half a percentage point.
Financial shares were the biggest drag on the S.& P. 500, dropping 0.8 percent as a group.
 The S.& P. 500 slipped 7.60 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,476.65. The Dow Jones industrial average decreased 39.10 points, or 0.3 percent, to 13,403.42. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 20.52 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,581.66. The Russell 2000 index, a benchmark for companies with a median market value of $644 million, dropped 1 percent, to 775.81.
 About 1.1 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the second fewest for a full session this year. 
 Fed funds futures contracts show a 50 percent chance that the Fed will lower its benchmark rate to 4.75 percent from 5.25 percent today, down from 58 percent odds on Friday. Traders are certain of a cut of at least a quarter percentage point.
 An unfounded concern that the United States economy will slip into a recession has pushed some stocks down too far, said Laszlo Birinyi Jr., president of Birinyi Associates in Westport, Conn.
 ''All the bad news is being magnified,'' Mr. Birinyi said. ''Good, solid companies which have nothing to do with finance, which are really immune from all these other issues, are being punished just as severely as stocks which are really tied to the issues.''
 Microsoft fell 32 cents, to $28.73. The company lost its appeal of a European Union antitrust decision after three years of legal wrangling.
 RadioShack declined $1.56, or 6.6 percent, to $22.10 for the biggest drop in the S.& P. 500. Credit Suisse said the company's investment in the video game business might reduce earnings.
 Out of 10 S.& P. industry groups, only energy producers gained, as oil advanced to a record for a fourth day. Exxon Mobil rose 59 cents, to $89.26. Chevron gained 28 cents, to $90.93.
 Newell Rubbermaid added $2.26, or 8.8 percent, to $28.02 for the steepest gain in the S.& P. 500. The company raised its full-year earnings and third-quarter sales forecasts on strength in its home and family unit and tools and hardware unit, as well as benefits from foreign currency rates.
 Ford Motor gained 25 cents, to $8.28. Bear Stearns lifted its recommendation on the stock to outperform from peer perform, saying the automaker might benefit from a renegotiated labor contract between General Motors and the United Automobile Workers.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 4.46 percent. The price fell 1/32, to 102 9/32.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Iraq, Beyond the Lame Duck Season

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Somebody Else's Mess'' (column, Sept. 16): Thomas L. Friedman is absolutely correct. It is time for the Democrats to give up trying to persuade the Congress to take steps now to end the war in Iraq and start planning the end game to be implemented after they take control of the government in 2009.
The president is stuck in his position and doesn't have the faintest idea of how the country can extricate itself from the Iraqi quagmire. The presidential candidates do not need to keep blaming President Bush and the Republicans for the failure of the war. 
 The public understands the history of the beginning of the war and its terrible cost in blood and treasure. What is needed now is the careful planning, both military and political, of the steps that will be required after the next president takes the oath of office to finally end our nation's war in Iraq.
 Burton Kreindel
 Newton, Mass., Sept. 16, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Both Thomas L. Friedman and Frank Rich (''Will the Democrats Betray Us?,'' column, Sept. 16) agree that President Bush ''kicks the can down the road,'' as Mr. Rich put it, refusing to declare an end to the madness that drove him into Iraq in the first place. 
 Mr. Bush's linking Iraq to Vietnam, however, figures brightly in what the president sees as his future: when his successor removes troops from Iraq and the inevitable chaos there takes place, the former president can give $100,000 speeches about what bloodshed the withdrawal caused, passing along the blame for the whole sordid mess, along with the cleanup, to his successor. Not even Machiavelli could have devised a better scenario for a failed president to follow. 
 Stephen E. Phillips
 Brooklyn, Sept. 16, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman skillfully analyzes actions in recent days and the Democrats' options for 2008, and suggests that the Republican Party might stage a comeback if, among other things, a recession ''forces a stark choice between bailing out Baghdad or Chicago.'' 
 I perceive that the Bush administration has already shown how it would choose, in New Orleans. 
 John Carl Bowers
 Brooklyn, Sept. 16, 2007
 To the Editor:
 That Frank Rich's clear-eyed assessments of the Bush administration's cynical marketing of the endless, unwinnable Iraq war fall on deaf ears is infuriating for a military mother like me. 
 Shame on Congress -- particularly blinkered Republicans -- for ''indefinitely shoveling our troops and treasure into the bottomless pit of Iraq'' by allowing the roundly discredited Bush administration to get away with manipulating deployment numbers and creating the illusion of troop reduction.
 Here's my suggestion: Bring back the draft, but tie its activation to any war that goes beyond three years. Not only might this delay or scale back future declarations of war, but it would spread the responsibility for the nation's security -- and the sorrow of sacrifice -- more equitably across the populace while preventing open-ended disasters like Iraq.
 With my United States Marine son scheduled to return to Iraq next spring, I would certainly push for such legislation. Donna J. Anton
 Hayle, England, Sept. 16, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Roger Cohen (column, Sept. 13) considers an Iraq breakup ''unthinkable.'' Why? What is so sacred about the artificial colonial borders? Why is ''democracy'' in conflict with self-determination? 
 Why should the Sunnis and Kurds be ruled by the Shiites? Or in Kosovo, what is so wrong with a referendum, which might result in the Serb-populated areas voting to return to Serbia? 
 Who are we to set the borders of other nations? How would we feel if they did it to us? Bela Liptak

HEADLINE: Economist's Life, Scored With Jazz Theme

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
In 1944 a draft board in downtown Manhattan rejected Alan Greenspan, then a recent high school graduate, for military service because he had a spot on his lung that looked like it might be tuberculosis. So Mr. Greenspan, suddenly without a plan for the future, auditioned to play clarinet for the trumpeter Henry Jerome's traveling big band.
 He got the job, but he was never a star. He was a sideman rather than a soloist. Among his fellow musicians he became known as the band's resident intellectual, the clarinetist who could also fill out his bandmates' income tax forms for them. Between sets, when they disappeared into the green room -- ''which would quickly fill with the smell of tobacco and pot,'' Mr. Greenspan recalls -- he read books about business.
 The pattern repeated itself, albeit in a more sober form, after the war ended and he began studying economics at New York University. Many of his classmates were swept up by grand questions relating to the new economic order, but Mr. Greenspan was more interested in numbers and equations. ''I still had the sideman psychology,'' he writes in his memoir, ''The Age of Turbulence.'' ''I preferred to focus on technical challenges and did not have a macro view.'' 
 His macro view wouldn't come until the 1950s, when his first wife introduced him to Ayn Rand's New York salon. Rand -- whom he calls ''quite plain to look at'' but ''a stabilizing force in my life'' -- pushed him to think beyond mathematics and helped turn him into a libertarian.
 By the time President Ronald Reagan named Mr. Greenspan to run the Federal Reserve in 1987, he had already a lived a full, fascinating, Zelig-like life. For years he was the quietly influential man off to the side. With his book he finally lets us know what he was thinking. 
 For a memoir from such a high-profile figure, it is surprisingly frank. Large parts of the book are downright entertaining. Its biggest failing -- the reason it isn't a great memoir -- is Mr. Greenspan's reluctance to be as forthright and penetrating about himself as he is about others.
 Born in 1926, he was raised in Washington Heights, the only son of parents who soon divorced. He attended George Washington High School a few years behind Henry Kissinger (and a few decades before the baseball stars Rod Carew and Manny Ramirez, a historical oddity that Mr. Greenspan, who still remembers Joe DiMaggio's 1936 batting average, probably appreciates). Before joining the Jerome big band, he played in the same informal ensemble as Stan Getz. At Columbia University, Arthur Burns, himself a future chairman of the Fed, became Mr. Greenspan's graduate-school adviser. 
 Like his father, a stockbroker, Mr. Greenspan eventually made his way to Wall Street, where he ran a consulting business that forecast the economy. He was doing quite nicely there when Martin Anderson, another Rand acolyte, asked if Mr. Greenspan wanted to join Richard M. Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign.
 Except for Jimmy Carter, Mr. Greenspan has worked with every president since 1969, and the book offers a fairly blunt critique of each. Gerald Ford, who's portrayed as an unusually decent politician, clearly ranks first. ''He always understood what he knew and what he didn't know,'' Mr. Greenspan writes.
 Despite their ideological differences, Bill Clinton seems to place second, thanks to his ''consistent, disciplined focus on long-term economic growth.'' At one point, with urging from Newt Gingrich, the House speaker, Mr. Greenspan called Rush Limbaugh to argue for the Clinton administration's Mexican loan guarantees. Mr. Greenspan even shares some of the credit for his signature insight -- recognizing early on that technology was transforming the economy -- with Mr. Clinton.
 Nixon, Reagan and George H. W. Bush each receives a mix of praise and criticism. Only the current President Bush goes without receiving credit for a single significant accomplishment.
 ''The Age of Turbulence'' is really two books, one of which I suspect Mr. Greenspan preferred writing and one of which he understood his audience would prefer reading. The second half -- the typically Greenspan half -- is a series of meditations on economic issues, like income inequality and the rise of China. 
 The first 250-odd pages are a standard autobiography, and Mr. Greenspan confesses in the acknowledgments that learning to write in the first person was a struggle. For all of the book's candor, this is a struggle he does not quite win. This first half of the book is utterly readable, but it lacks a narrative core. It's telling that the book opens on Sept. 11, 2001, with Mr. Greenspan on a plane flying home from Switzerland that gets rerouted. This is supposed to serve as drama.
 Mr. Greenspan also doesn't really let readers inside his life. He laments that Nixon's televised announcement of price controls in 1971 pre-empted ''Bonanza'' -- ''a show I loved to watch'' -- and he calls his wife, Andrea Mitchell, ''very beautiful.'' But he does not easily admit error. He does not even confess to having his own ambitions. He seems to want people to believe that he accepted his fantastic ascent with reluctance.
 Yet, perhaps accidentally, he has still managed to create a lasting image of himself. He never seems happier than when poring over economic indicators that allow him to predict everything from the 1958 steel recession to the 1990s boom. ''My early training was to immerse myself in extensive detail in the workings of some small part of the world and to infer from that detail the way that segment of the world behaves. That is the process I have applied throughout my career,'' he writes.
 He lacks the same sure footing when confronting the great political issues, and even the economic ones, of the last few decades. He provided the critically influential voice in support of the current administration's tax cuts, for instance, but he now disowns them. He worries that the backlash to globalization could create a ''truly serious economic crisis,'' but his proposed remedies -- like higher pay for math teachers -- don't seem up to the task. 
 Despite Rand's tutoring he never quite escapes the sideman's psychology. Now, there should be no shame in that. Mr. Greenspan may have had a better feel for the ups and downs of the postwar American economy than anyone else, and he put his talents to good use as a central banker. The question that lingers is why the rest of us allowed him to be treated as something much more.

HEADLINE: Predicting a Revenue Slowdown, Bloomberg Warns of Leaner Times Ahead

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
City budget officials say they are seeing signs that the soaring revenues of the last several years are coming to an end, and they have begun preparing for belt-tightening in the months ahead.
 The anticipated falloff is due in large part to lower expected profits on Wall Street and a projected decline in large real estate transactions.
''The economies of our world and our city are cyclical, and it looks like, sadly, we're going from one of growth to one of hopefully not decline, but certainly nowhere near as much growth, if any,'' Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday at a news conference on the Brooklyn waterfront. 
 Officials in Mr. Bloomberg's administration have often warned of shortfalls that never materialized. But this time around, said Mark Page, the city's budget director, continued fallout in the financial services industry from the national mortgage crisis and recent losses at hedge funds are likely to significantly cut into profits on Wall Street this year. 
 In turn, that means less tax revenue for the city, and lower real estate transaction fees -- an unusually rich source of revenue in recent years -- as fewer fat bonuses fuel high-end apartment shopping sprees.
 In addition, Mr. Page said, city officials had already been projecting lower revenue from real estate transactions in the current fiscal year than in the year that ended in June because they predicted fewer large deals like the $5.4 billion purchase of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village.
 Also adding to the gloomy economic atmosphere, he said, are recent national jobs and retail sales numbers, which were both expected to be up, but came in down.
 ''It all translates into what appears to be a slower expectation of economic growth,'' Mr. Page said, adding that the city did not need a big reduction in revenues ''to end up having it cost a lot of money.''
 Although city officials are not yet predicting an economic downturn, the city is already looking to rein in costs. About 10 days ago, Mr. Bloomberg sent a letter to all agencies seeking to limit new hiring and warning that budget cuts may be necessary in the coming months.
 ''As a practical matter, if you start trying to squeeze down marginal spending sooner, you don't have to jam them down as much to save the money you need,'' Mr. Page said in explaining the move.
 In the letter, the mayor said he had asked Mr. Page to ''closely scrutinize all agency hiring.'' 
 ''It is easier and more prudent to tightly manage headcount now, rather than face staff reductions in the future,'' Mr. Bloomberg wrote.
 Mr. Bloomberg, who has increased city spending since taking office faster than any other mayor in the past 27 years, yesterday defended his approach of spending to maintain a high quality of life in the city, but acknowledged he has concerns about the looming slowdown.
 ''This city wants to spend more and more and more, and only if we grow can we afford to do that,'' he said at yesterday's news conference. ''I've always worried about what happens when things slow down, and to keep us from overspending when things are good, but not to walk away from the investments that we need if we're going to have the greatest city in the world keep going.''
 Arguing that slashing services during the fiscal crisis of the 1970s crippled the city with skyrocketing crime, filthy streets and a mass exodus of residents, he said, ''What we have to do is provide services as efficiently as we can, and in the good times try to save money for the bad times that invariably come.''

HEADLINE: A Slump That's Far From Over

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: Leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve sent the stock market soaring yesterday. So can it stop the decline in home prices, too?
 Don't count on it.
 From the late 1960s until 2000, the price of the typical American home and the income of the typical family moved almost in lock step. House prices rose a bit more quickly than incomes during the occasional real estate boom, but would always settle down again. In 2000, the median home cost about $130,000, roughly three times the typical household income -- almost precisely the ratio that had held since the '60s.
 Then came a real estate boom unlike any before it. By last year, this ratio of prices to incomes had suddenly shot up to 4.5. For it to return to its old level, home prices would have to fall by an almost unthinkable one-third, and probably more in California, Florida and the Northeast. 
 There are good reasons to believe that the real estate slump won't be quite that severe -- more on that shortly -- but there is also reason to think the slump still has a long way to go. That's why the Fed went further than most Wall Street analysts expected yesterday, cutting interest rates by half a percentage point and announcing, in effect, that it is now on a recession watch. 
 And whether home prices begin falling noticeably or merely stagnate for years until incomes catch up, it's clear that the real estate bust has become the dominant force in the economy.
 Earlier this year, Robert J. Barbera, who's been a Wall Street economist for 25 years, was predicting a soft landing for housing -- that is, stagnation rather than substantial declines. So were most forecasters. ''But now it appears that's not the way we're going to do it,'' says Mr. Barbera, the chief economist at ITG Hoenig, who correctly predicted yesterday's Fed move.
 What has changed in recent weeks are the spike in mortgage rates, the drying up of subprime lending and the ever-growing number of houses on the market. A research firm called RealtyTrac reported yesterday that mortgage lenders had filed 244,000 foreclosure notices last month, up from only 113,000 a year earlier. Amazingly, more than a third of the filings were in just two states, California and Florida, the sites of some of the largest prices increases and the most ridiculous mortgage lending.
 It's also worth looking at what happened to home sales last month in California, where counties release property transaction records earlier than they do in most of the rest of the country. With mortgages harder to come by, home sales dropped even more rapidly than they had earlier in the year. In the Los Angeles area, 35 percent fewer homes sold this August than in August 2006, according to an analysis by DataQuick Information Systems. Around San Francisco, the decline was 31 percent.
 The exact path that housing prices will take over the next few years is, obviously, unknowable. But there is a good deal of evidence to suggest that the typical home last year was overvalued by something like 20 percent. I wouldn't necessarily argue with anyone who insisted on 15 or 25 percent. 
 The reason it may not be bigger is that mortgage rates remain a good bit lower than they were for much of the last generation. But they're not so different as to suggest that home prices have returned to rational levels. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody'sEconomy.com, ran an analysis for me this week in which he looked at home values, mortgage rates, tax rates and incomes going back to 1968. Taking all these into account, he found prices were about 20 percent too high. 
 Interestingly enough, Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed governor, made a presentation at the Fed's annual Jackson Hole conference last month where he sketched out the effects of a hypothetical housing downturn in coming years. The price decline he chose was 20 percent. 
 The scariest part of a national decline like this is that it could be more like 40 percent in some parts of the country. That's difficult to fathom -- and, in fact, construction would probably come to a halt in those places, cushioning the price drop locally and, by extension, a bit nationally. But 40 percent is not out of the question in a few places, like the southwestern coast of Florida.
 Remember that all of these declines are relative to income or inflation. The median house price nationwide has already started falling since last year, according to the S.& P./Case-Shiller Index, the most accurate measure. If actual prices were to fall 10 percent over the next year or so and then do nothing for following five years, that would add up to about a 20 percent decline, adjusted for inflation. 
 This would be a big deal. It would lead to lost jobs, less consumer spending and slower economic growth. It would be the worst housing downturn on record.
 It's hard not to notice that the latest round of grim news has come in the same week that Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke's predecessor at the Fed, is making the rounds of talk shows to promote his new memoir. Mr. Greenspan has long defended his inaction during the housing boom, particularly his decision not to crack down on out-of-control mortgage lending, by saying that bubbles are extremely difficult to recognize until after the fact.
 I don't know, though. This one didn't seem so subtle. 
 Now Mr. Bernanke has to deal with its aftermath. So do the rest of us.

HEADLINE: The Fed's Move Helps Mood on Street

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Jeremy W. Peters and Eric Dash contributed reporting.

 BODY:
There was something for just about everyone in the Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to cut its benchmark interest rate by half a point.
 For homeowners, it could lead to lower mortgage rates in the months to come. For investors, it could help stabilize and bolster volatile share prices. For Wall Street financiers and for companies across America, it could eventually make borrowing easier and cheaper.
 ''This is a bold move,'' said James T. Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investment Management, a mutual fund company in Boston. ''It's going to alleviate concerns that the credit market will kill the economy.''
 But while the news was welcomed by many, the reaction was not universally upbeat. 
 Economists and market specialists cautioned that the cut would take time to work through the system. It could stoke inflation and send the dollar tumbling, especially if it is followed by another cut in the coming months. And the move may do little to help families who are confronted with rising mortgage payments, falling home prices and a weaker job market. Furthermore, unexpected problems could yet emerge in the complex investments that were popular with banks and hedge funds.
 The rate cut, to 4.75 percent, was twice as large as most investors had expected, and it showed in the market's reaction. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.92 percent, to 1,519.78, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 335.97 points, or 2.51 percent, to 13,739.39. It was the biggest single-day gain for both indexes since early 2003.
 Wall Street's enthusiasm spilled into Asia this morning. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index soared 531.49 points, or 3.36 percent, to 16,333.29 points on the Tokyo Stock Exchange at the close of morning trading.
 In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index jumped 733.05 points, or 2.98 percent, to 25,309.9 in early trading after rising as much as 3.72 percent minutes after the market opened.
 Many commercial banks followed the Fed and cut the prime rate they charge their best customers for loans. In the commodity markets, gold and oil prices both surged yesterday afternoon. The dollar fell to a new low against the euro.
 Investors in the futures market are now betting that the Fed will cut rates at least once more this year, to 4.5 percent, at the meeting in late October. But the central bank was more guarded. Noting that ''some inflation risks remain,'' the Fed said that its actions would have to balance concerns about slowing growth against the threat of inflation.
 For the broader economy, changes in the Fed's target short-term interest rate, which banks charge one another, usually takes several months to a year to have a noticeable impact.
 The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage stood at 6.31 percent last week, down from its high for the year of 6.74 percent in June, Freddie Mac said. The rate could fall further if the Fed's move and statement encourage investors to buy more mortgage-backed securities, which are used to finance loans.
 There is some indication that investors may have a bigger appetite as a result of the Fed's actions. The premium that investors demand to hold bonds issued by corporations and agencies like Fannie Mae, the big buyer of home loans, over Treasuries narrowed noticeably yesterday.
 ''The key is going to be whether this cut sparks risk appetite,'' said Binky Chadha, chief United States equity strategist at Deutsche Bank in New York. ''And the last two hours suggests that it is clearly doing that.''
 Since the credit squeeze began in late July, some on Wall Street have been clamoring for the Fed to cut interest rates and ease the flow of money in the financial system. Perhaps the most colorful display of that sentiment came in early August when Jim Cramer, the CNBC talk-show host and a former hedge fund manager, railed against the Fed and said the central bank's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, ''has no idea how bad it is out there.''
 Mr. Bernanke and the Fed, for their part, stayed above the fray, in an effort that many bank watchers say was intended to avoid the perception that policy makers would bail out investors who made bad bets. The Fed then cut the discount rate it charged to lend money directly to banks, and it stepped up its lending activities to ensure that the Fed funds rate remained at or below the previous target of 5.25 percent.
 Those measures, coupled with a growing belief that the Fed was poised to cut interest rates, injected some optimism into the market in recent weeks. Before yesterday's announcement, the S.& P. 500 index, for instance, was up nearly 5 percent from Aug. 15. That essentially put the index back to where it was after policy makers decided in early August to keep rates unchanged.
 In the credit markets, the adjustment has been somewhat slower. The commercial paper market for short-term debt remains tight, though borrowing costs for companies and banks that use those loans have been trending lower. The premium that investors demand to hold corporate and high-yield bonds has narrowed, though it remains far wider than it was early this year.
 Other segments of the market remain essentially frozen. Wall Street banks have not issued many new mortgage-backed securities this summer, and trading in bonds backed by home loans made in the last two years remains light. .
 In the mergers and acquisition world, investment banks have been able to bring some pending deals to market, but they have had to offer investors higher returns and other incentives. Bankers are still sitting on more than $300 billion in leveraged loans that need to be sold to investors.
 Market specialists say that yesterday's rate cut may do little to address the bigger problems in the credit markets. Lower rates are helpful, these people say, but they may not make banks and investors more willing to lower significantly the premium on mortgages to people with less than stellar credit or those who are borrowing a large amount with little money down. The concern is that such investments could suffer losses if the economy continues to weaken and if house prices fall further.
 The crisis in the credit market has already driven many mortgage lenders out of business or away from certain kinds of loans like jumbo mortgages for amounts more than $417,000. This cut in interest rates is not expected to solve the broader problems in the housing market.
 ''It certainly is going to help, but part of these problems we are facing are intractable,'' said James L. Melcher, a partner at Balestra Capital, a hedge fund in New York that believes the housing problems will intensify.
 Mr. Melcher and other market specialists are also concerned that too much easing by the Fed could spur inflation. Another source of inflation would come from a falling dollar, which would make imports more expensive while making exports cheaper. 
 One euro now buys $1.3984, up from $1.3868 on Monday evening. 
 Gold, which rises in value during periods of high inflation and when the dollar is weak, rose 1.6 percent, to $728.60 a troy ounce, and crude oil prices jumped 2.25 percent, to $82.38 a barrel. Both commodities set records.
 Market specialists said the size of the Fed's rate cut and its nod to inflation suggested that policy makers were trying to keep investors' expectations in check regarding future rate cuts. 
 Peter E. Kretzmer, a senior economist with Bank of America, said policy makers were trying to draw attention away from the central bank for a little while. 
 ''They said we're going to be a little bold and remove at least one source of uncertainty,'' Mr. Kretzmer said. ''And that is the source that says, 'What is the Fed thinking, and when will they move again?' Maybe they can take the market's mind off the Fed for a little while.''
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: The High Costs of Ethanol

 BODY:
Backed by the White House, corn-state governors and solid blocks on both sides of Congress's partisan divide, the politics of biofuels could hardly look sunnier. The economics of the American drive to increase ethanol in the energy supply are more discouraging. 
 American corn-based ethanol is expensive. And while it can help cut oil imports and provide modest reductions in greenhouse gases compared to conventional gasoline, corn ethanol also carries considerable risks. Even now as Europe and China join the United States in ramping up production, world food prices are rising, threatening misery for the poorest countries. 
 The European Union has announced that it wants to replace 10 percent of its transport fuel with biofuels by 2020. China is aiming for a 15 percent share. The United States is already on track to exceed Congress's 2005 goal of doubling the amount of ethanol used in motor fuels to 7.5 billion gallons by 2012. In his State of the Union speech in January, President Bush set a new goal of 35 billion gallons of biofuels by 2017. In June, the Senate raised it to 36 billion gallons by 2022. Of that, Congress said that 15 billion gallons should come from corn and 21 billion from advanced biofuels that are nowhere near commercial production.
 The distortions in agricultural production are startling. Corn prices are up about 50 percent from last year, while soybean prices are projected to rise up to 30 percent in the coming year, as farmers have replaced soy with corn in their fields. The increasing cost of animal feed is raising the prices of dairy and poultry products.
 The news from the rest of the world is little better. Ethanol production in the United States and other countries, combined with bad weather and rising demand for animal feed in China, has helped push global grain prices to their highest levels in at least a decade. Earlier this year, rising prices of corn imports from the United States triggered mass protests in Mexico. The chief of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has warned that rising food prices around the world have threatened social unrest in developing countries. 
 A recent report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an economic forum of rich nations, called on the United States and other industrialized nations to eliminate subsidies for the production of ethanol which, the report said, is driving up food costs, threatening natural habitats and imposing other environmental costs. ''The overall environmental impacts of ethanol and biodiesel can very easily exceed those of petrol and mineral diesel,'' it said.
 The economics of corn ethanol have never made much sense. Rather than importing cheap Brazilian ethanol made from sugar cane, the United States slaps a tariff of 54 cents a gallon on ethanol from Brazil. Then the government provides a tax break of 51 cents a gallon to American ethanol producers -- on top of the generous subsidies that corn growers already receive under the farm program. 
 Corn-based ethanol also requires a lot of land. An O.E.C.D. report two years ago suggested that replacing 10 percent of America's motor fuel with biofuels would require about a third of the total cropland devoted to cereals, oilseeds and sugar crops. 
 Meanwhile, the environmental benefits are modest. A study published last year by scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, estimated that after accounting for the energy used to grow the corn and turn it into ethanol, corn ethanol lowers emissions of greenhouse gases by only 13 percent. 
 The United States will not meet the dual challenges of reducing global warming and its dependence on foreign suppliers of energy until it manages to reduce energy consumption. That should be its main goal. 
 There is nothing wrong with developing alternative fuels, and there is high hope among environmentalists and even venture capitalists that more advanced biofuels -- like cellulosic ethanol -- can eventually play a constructive role in reducing oil dependency and greenhouse gases. What's wrong is letting politics -- the kind that leads to unnecessary subsidies, the invasion of natural landscapes best left alone and soaring food prices that hurt the poor -- rather than sound science and sound economics drive America's energy policy.

HEADLINE: CBS Screens 'Kid Nation' At Schools

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 18 

 BODY:
For weeks CBS has objected to criticism of its new reality show ''Kid Nation,'' which is the subject of an inquiry by the New Mexico attorney general over its possible skirting of child labor laws. CBS has said critics should hold their tongues until they see the show, which leads off its prime-time lineup on Wednesday. 
 But at the same time that the network has refused to share copies of the premiere with critics and reporters in order to maintain secrecy over that episode's results, it has been screening the program for schoolchildren and potential advertisers.
 A CBS spokesman confirmed reports in Variety and Entertainment Weekly on Tuesday that the network had organized screenings of ''Kid Nation'' at schools in at least seven large cities around the country, including New York and Los Angeles. Entertainment Weekly reported that 125 children in grades four through eight at the New Foundations Charter School in Philadelphia had watched an episode.
 ''Kid Nation'' took 40 children, ages 8 to 15, and placed them in a New Mexico ghost town for 40 days to see if they could build a working society and economy. 
 Chris Ender, a CBS spokesman, said on Monday that the network had decided not to offer television critics advance copies of the first episode of ''Kid Nation'' because it did not want to reveal whether any children chose to leave the show in its first week, or which child won the $20,000 prize offered at the end of each episode.
 Mr. Ender said CBS had previously withheld advance screenings of ''Survivor'' and offered truncated versions of ''The Amazing Race'' to maintain secrecy about the programs and the winners of their initial competitions.
 But in screening the show for schoolchildren, CBS seemed to forgo the need for confidentiality. In a statement on Tuesday, CBS said the screenings at schools had ''received overwhelmingly favorable reaction from the students, parents and teachers who have participated.''

HEADLINE: Before Gentrification Was Cool, It Was a Movie

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
Norman Jewison was casting his mind back nearly 40 years, trying to remember why he didn't direct ''The Landlord.''
 ''I went to Europe,'' he said, his voice on the telephone trailing off. ''This was at the point of ... ''
 It was at a point when Mr. Jewison was hot. In the previous two years he'd brought United Artists a ton of money and six Academy Awards with ''In the Heat of the Night'' and ''The Thomas Crown Affair.'' So he had the leverage he needed to get the studio to back an experimental, satirical film, from a script by an unknown black screenwriter, about a wealthy young white man who decides to buy a Brooklyn tenement and ease out the black tenants so he can gut it and move in. But Mr. Jewison didn't have time to make it himself.
 ''I know what happened,'' he said, sounding relieved. ''The reason that I asked him to direct it was I was already involved in 'Fiddler.' I moved to Europe with my family for the next 10 years. I was a little disillusioned at that time.'' 
 That time was 1969 -- disillusionment was going around -- and ''him'' was Hal Ashby, Mr. Jewison's friend and longtime film editor. ''Fiddler on the Roof'' would bring Mr. Jewison one of his three best-director Oscar nominations. ''The Landlord,'' Mr. Ashby's directing debut, would disappear after its 1970 release -- rarely shown and just as rarely discussed.
 But ''The Landlord'' deserves attention, and not just because it's a terrific film (''a wondrously wise, sad and hilarious comedy,'' as Howard Thompson put it in his review for The New York Times). Its one-week revival at Film Forum in Manhattan, beginning today, is a chance for audiences to see a pivotal moment not only in the career of Mr. Ashby -- presaging the style and themes of his breakout, ''Shampoo,'' five years later -- but also in the histories of American film and, coincidentally, of New York real estate.
 (The film is not available on DVD; copies of the out-of-print VHS edition can be found online at sites including amazon.com.)
 Film history first: ''The Landlord,'' which brought Mr. Ashby together with the cinematographer Gordon Willis (who would soon shoot ''Klute'' and go on to film the ''Godfather'' trilogy) and the cameraman Michael Chapman (who would be the cinematographer on ''Taxi Driver''), can call itself one of the best early products of the now-hallowed American mavericks of the 1970s. Francis Ford Coppola's ''Godfather,'' Martin Scorsese's ''Mean Streets'' and George Lucas's ''American Graffiti'' were still two to three years to come.
 ''It was the beginning of something pretty amazing, of a film movement that Hal was a major part of helping kick-start,'' said Beau Bridges, who played Elgar Enders, the well-meaning dilettante turned landlord whose eyes, not to mention his wallet and eventually his heart, are opened by his new tenants. ''I was just doing my best. I was in there with some giants.''
 As for real estate history: Elgar's purchase is variously described in the film as being in ''an old ghetto area'' and ''a dreadful slum.'' It is, in fact, in Park Slope -- the exteriors were filmed at 51 Prospect Place, near Sixth Avenue -- and the threat of gentrification that Elgar represents has, of course, long since come true. The film never specifies what he pays for his battered, white-painted tenement, but it would have borne little relation to the $1.5 million to $2 million the buffed brownstones on the block now sell for.
 ''We didn't know that at the time!'' Mr. Jewison said, laughing. ''I wish I did, I would have bought the locations. I think they were empty. As I remember, they were totally abandoned in a lot of the places we were shooting.''
 Mr. Jewison had already tackled racial injustice and civil rights with ''In the Heat of the Night,'' released in February 1967, but after that had come the murder of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a summer of riots. 
 ''The story we were telling about race relations was happening right at the time while we were making that film,'' Mr. Bridges recalled, and rumors that an assistant director of ''Cotton Comes to Harlem'' had been shot from a Harlem rooftop didn't make the white cast and crew of ''The Landlord'' any more comfortable on their Park Slope and Bedford-Stuyvesant locations.
 For a memorable scene in which Elgar, wearing a white suit and holding a large potted plant, is chased down the sidewalk by the men he finds sitting on his stoop, Mr. Bridges had to run three or four blocks between raucous crowds of onlookers. ''I looked up on the rooftops,'' he recalled, ''and the locals were cheering and yelling 'get that white. ...' '' 
 ''I was sure I was going to take a bullet,'' he added.
 Matching the tenor of the times, the humor of ''The Landlord'' isn't always subtle, particularly with regard to Elgar's family -- his loonily conservative father (Walter Brooke), his well-meaning but fundamentally racist mother (a hilarious Lee Grant, who was nominated for a best-supporting-actress Oscar) and his liberal-when-stoned sister (Susan Anspach). Their scenes together often involve a racial-political vaudeville reminiscent of Brian De Palma's high jinks in ''Greetings'' (1968) and ''Hi Mom!'' (1970).
 But the overall tone of Mr. Ashby's film isn't hard-edged and absurdist; it's lyrical and layered, helped by Mr. Willis's ravishing interiors and nighttime streetscapes; Bill Gunn's screenplay, constantly funny in confounding ways (''You whities scream about miscegenation and you done watered down every race you ever hated''); Al Kooper's score, featuring the Staples Singers; and a phenomenal group of black performers that includes Pearl Bailey, an unrecognizably young and intense Louis Gossett Jr. and the distinguished stage actress Diana Sands as the woman who completes Elgar's sentimental education in love, prejudice and economics. And every step of that awakening can be charted in the petulant, joyous, rueful performance of Mr. Bridges.
 ''It's kind of an imperfect film because it was Hal's first, and he kind of honed his craft as he went along,'' Mr. Bridges said of Mr. Ashby, who died in 1988. ''But I'd like people to know about it.''
 ''The Landlord'' plays through Tuesday at Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village; (212) 727-8110 or filmforum.org.

HEADLINE: Lehman Profit Is Stronger Than Expected; Wall St. Relieved

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
The markets breathed a sigh of relief yesterday as Lehman Brothers, the first major Wall Street bank to report third-quarter earnings, took a hit from the seized-up mortgage markets and turbulent credit conditions but still posted results that were stronger than expected. 
 Investors had expected that weakness in credit markets would weigh heavily on Lehman, which has traditionally relied heavily on fixed income -- a grouping that includes everything from bonds, credit derivatives, commodities, currencies, interest rates and the issuance and packaging of home loans. Lehman is the No. 1 underwriter of mortgage-backed bonds, or bonds backed by pools of mortgages. 
 Third-quarter profit fell 3 percent, to $887 million, or $1.54 a share, from $916 million, or $1.57 a year ago. It declined 30 percent from a strong second quarter. 
 Write-downs in the mortgage market as well as loans to private equity firms that the bank has not been able to sell reduced revenue by $700 million. 
 Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had forecast profit of $1.47 a share.
 ''Lehman took its medicine and still had a decent quarter,'' said Mike Mayo, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. ''The bad news is what was known and there wasn't anything to go with that.'' 
 Mr. Mayo said the market had not appreciated the fact that many of the brokerage firms, including Lehman, are geographically diversified. Lehman said 53 percent of its revenue came from outside the United States. 
 ''It's not smooth sailing,'' Lehman's chief financial officer, Christopher O'Meara, said, ''but the worst of this credit correction is behind us.'' 
 Mr. O'Meara expected merger and acquisition volumes would end the year up 15 to 20 percent. 
 Lehman's shares closed up $5.87 to $64.49, on a day the overall market rose 2.5 percent after the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate.
 A rival brokerage firm, Morgan Stanley, reports earnings today, while Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns report tomorrow. 
 Lehman's results seemed to bode well for thousands of employees who are trying to calibrate year-end bonuses. Those bonuses, which provide the bulk of a trader or banker's compensation, strongly influence everything from Manhattan real estate prices to global art values. 
 Though bonus decisions are made in the fourth quarter, the bank accrues, or sets aside, a portion of revenue every quarter, so each period offers a critical data point. This quarter, Lehman set aside $2.1 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in the second quarter. 
 For the nine months ended in August, Lehman has set aside $7.3 billion, 14 percent more than the $6.4 billion set aside in the 2006 period. Lehman had 28,783 employees at the end of the third quarter, 16 percent more than one year ago. 
 But the outlook might not be as bright for mortgage-related traders.
 ''I guess that means that the mortgage-backed traders won't be buying new Maseratis this year,'' an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, Brad Hintz, said.
 Lehman's results offered a few surprises. Revenue from mergers and acquisitions was a record $425 million -- a surprise -- while fixed-income capital markets revenue, not surprisingly, fell 47 percent from a year ago and 43 percent from the second quarter.
 The equities business was up from a year ago but down from the last quarter. Mr. O'Meara said that market volatility helped the equity derivatives business while hurting the cash stock trading business, which suffers when there is not a clear direction in the market. 
 Investment management, a business Wall Street banks have focused on in recent years because it is thought to be more stable, had a 33 percent increase in revenue from the third quarter of 2006 and 4 percent from the second quarter. Many banks are expanding in asset management to offset their proprietary trading groups, where profits are notoriously unpredictable. 
 The bank offered an unusual amount of clarity on its positions, in part because the lack of information has made Lehman among the worst performers among the brokerage stocks. 
 Mr. O'Meara said that the bank had $44 billion in commitments -- loans made to clients but not yet financed -- at the end of the second quarter. Of those loans, $17 billion remain, with the firm having sold or canceled the rest. 
 ''The biggest deals have not gotten done but there are many deals, $500 million to $1 billion, that have gotten done,'' Mr. O'Meara said. The bank has made commitments of another $10 billion, but on better terms to investors. The $700 million hit in the quarter represented the difference between the value of the commitments made -- bonds or loans -- and the price at which they could be sold and write-downs on residential mortgage-related assets. 
 On a call with analysts, Mr. O'Meara said the total hit from the loans was ''well over $1 billion,'' which was offset by hedges. 
 Analysts had been concerned about the deteriorating value of the loans and their arbitrary pricing in an environment where nothing is being bought and sold.

A MOVE TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE In an effort to stop the turmoil in the housing and financial markets from bringing down the overall economy, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large one-half percentage point, to 4.75 percent from 5.25 percent. 
 While the news that the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by half a point was welcomed by many, the reaction was not universally upbeat. Economists and market specialists cautioned that the cut would take time to work through the system, and it may do little to help families confronted with rising mortgage payments and falling home prices. [C1.] 
 There are good reasons to believe that the housing slump has a long way to go, and that's the main reason the Federal Reserve went further than expected in cutting interest rates. Economic Scene: David Leonhardt. [C1.]

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Fell 1.4% in August, Led by Gasoline

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM and JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Prices at the producer level declined in August, the government reported yesterday, signaling a possible slackening of inflation pressures in the months ahead.
 Rapidly falling energy costs, including a 13.8 percent plunge in gasoline prices, led to a 1.4 percent drop in the Producer Price Index in August after a 0.6 percent rise in July. But the more crucial core rate of inflation, which excludes food and energy, was up 0.2 percent, a slight acceleration from July, driven by increased costs for vehicles and prescription drugs.
 ''There are other indications in the goods sector that there are some significant price pressures,'' said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist for Goldman Sachs. ''So you want to put it in perspective, but it's definitely a piece of good news.'' 
 While a recent rebound in oil prices could lead to higher fuel costs in the weeks ahead, other inflation pressures appear to be easing. Analysts pointed to a half-point decline in the cost of goods used to make other goods, known as intermediate goods, as a sign that price increases were slowing further up the production chain and that consumers may see some relief as those goods are processed and enter the retail market. 
 ''The intermediate-materials pattern offers a hint of evidence that inflation pressures at the consumer price level will be weakening,'' said Kenneth Beauchemin, United States economist for Global Insight, an economic research firm in Lexington, Mass. 
 The new inflation figures were released ahead of the Federal Reserve's announcement yesterday afternoon cutting its benchmark interest rate by an unexpectedly large half a percentage point, a move that was warmly greeted by Wall Street investors dealing with a credit squeeze caused by this summer's subprime mortgage crisis. 
 The slowdown in producer prices -- what businesses charge one another for materials and goods used along the way in the production process -- suggested some leeway for the Fed to move ahead with its expected cut, though several economists said the report had little impact on yesterday's meeting.
 ''This will carry mostly zero weight,'' said Mickey Levy, the chief economist at Bank of America. ''It's just obvious that the Fed's focus is not on near-term inflation conditions.''
 The report on consumer prices -- a more closely watched and less volatile inflation gauge -- will be released today.
 Prices of intermediate goods like steel, cement and industrial chemicals fell 1.2 percent last month. And prices of crude goods, which include raw goods like scrap metal and animals for slaughter, dropped 3 percent.
 The drop in energy costs was the largest factor pushing prices down in August. The price of gasoline fell 13.8 percent; natural gas 8.5 percent; and home heating oil 6 percent. Energy prices, however, have been rather erratic in recent months. The price of a barrel of oil has been posting record highs above $80 in recent days.
 Food prices declined 0.2 percent. But eggs, fresh fruits and vegetables fell by much larger amounts.
 Capital equipment prices -- for items like agricultural machinery, heavy-duty vehicles and office furniture -- were essentially flat.
 Mr. Levy said that nothing about yesterday's report was ''really out of whack,'' noting that trends in productivity, wages and unit labor costs offset any rises in inflation for core wholesale goods over the last year.
 But with the Federal Reserve announcement dominating the talk on Wall Street yesterday, the producer price report quickly became old news.
 ''It's taking the back seat to the Fed's more pressing issues,'' Mr. Levy said.

HEADLINE: In the Name of Tourism, Let Racing Tires Screech

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

 BODY:
Slowly, life has started to change in Millville, N.J., a city of 27,000 in the belly of rural South Jersey. Downtown, which once had a vacancy rate of 60 percent, now features an arts district and has far fewer empty buildings than it did a decade ago. Last year, an off-track betting parlor, with a popular 300-seat restaurant, opened in nearby Vineland. 
 What comes next, Millville officials hope, will be the capstone. 
 It is called Thunderbolt Raceway, a $100 million shrine to the region's motor sports fans. The 700-acre complex, which is under construction, will feature two undulating and curvy tracks, a clubhouse, vehicle bays and tennis courts. The goal is to offer people a place where they can emulate the stars of auto racing instead of buying tickets to watch them.
 While the complex is not scheduled to open until July, local officials are already celebrating. Tonight, they are to hold a small ceremony at the site to honor Chris Economaki, the 86-year-old race-announcing legend who is known as the dean of American motor sports.
 Looking ahead to the opening of the track, the city envisions momentous changes. 
 ''It's the culmination in the transformation of this area from an industrial economy to one based on tourism,'' said Donald Fauerbach, a former Wheaton Glass executive who is now the executive director of the New Jersey Conference of Mayors. ''The motor sports enthusiast is an underserved market, and here we are with 30 million people within 200 miles. It's a new day for Cumberland County.''
 The old day in Cumberland County depended heavily on the glass industry as well as agriculture and food processing. Wheaton Glass had 10,000 employees into the 1970s. It was joined by others, like Kerr Glass and Owens-Illinois, and smaller firms. Vineland was the center of the farming and food-processing businesses.
 But the glass-industry jobs dwindled, and farming slowed. By the mid-1990s, unemployment had reached 15 percent, according to Don Ayres, Millville's economic development director. 
 The city's glass industry went from nearly 20,000 jobs in the late 1970s to about 3,000 by the early part of this decade. Sixty percent of the downtown real estate was vacant. Large tracts were available, but Mr. Ayres said he found few potential investors.
 ''It was a hard sell to find people to come to Millville, to say the least,'' Mr. Ayres said.
 Then, in early 2003, he went to a shopping center convention in New York, where he talked with two developers, Joe Savaro and Lee Brahin, from suburban Philadelphia. In passing, Mr. Ayres said, he mentioned a property near the Millville Airport on the edge of town that had been considered in the 1990s as a possible site for a Nascar track.
 Mr. Brahin is a self-described gearhead, a motor sports enthusiast. A friend and fellow enthusiast, Harvey Siegel, a New York developer, had recently revived the Virginia International Raceway in a depressed area around Danville, Va. He turned it into a sort of gearhead country club, with drive-it-yourself tracks, clubhouses, vehicle storage and a small hotel.
 Mr. Siegel said that Danville, a city of 53,000, was in worse shape in 1999 than Millville. 
 ''The economy was in a sorry state, and the track, which thrived from the 1950s and 1960s, had been closed for 25 years,'' he said. ''But I had a few bucks and knew that there were a lot of us who raced cars or liked cars or wanted to try to race cars and had some money, too.''
 Since the complex opened there, the number of hotel rooms in Danville has doubled and there has been an estimated $40 million increase in the economy, according to Danville's economic development office.
 Mr. Siegel said that racing centers gave people someplace to drive or learn to drive, and to shop, in a mall-like area of motor sports businesses. Thunderbolt, which will also feature an all-terrain vehicle track, a kart-racing track and a smaller oval, is selling memberships, with a $5,000 initiation fee and annual dues of $2,400. The entire project is expected to be completed in 2015.
 ''Just like baseball or tennis or golf, people watch, like they have watched Nascar, and eventually want to try it for themselves,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''New Jersey has always been a hotbed of racing, with places like Flemington and New Egypt and lots of drag racing. Where else could we have found 700 acres next to an airport and within hours of all these people?'' 
 The project, which has few residential or retail neighbors, received broad support and a series of environmental and zoning approvals.
 According to a Rowan University study, Thunderbolt is expected to create 1,500 jobs and could lead to 6,000 additional jobs in hospitality, automotive and retail businesses. That would be welcome news for a city that has an 8 percent unemployment rate.
 For Mr. Fauerbach, the former Wheaton Glass executive, the project realizes a longtime goal of attracting motor sports to his hometown. As a former motorcycle racer, he said, he will never forget the first time the developers shared their plan.
 ''I remember the day they came down here like it was my birthday -- March 24, 2003,'' he recalled. ''It was just the right set of people and the right place and the right time.''

HEADLINE: Settlements Do Not Deter 9/11 Plaintiffs Seeking Trials

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
Families of 14 of the people killed in the planes hijacked on Sept. 11, 2001, have settled their lawsuits, but relatives of other victims said yesterday that they would continue fighting in court to address their questions about how Islamic terrorists bypassed airport security, commandeered four jets and killed thousands of people.
 One of those relatives, Mike Low, whose 28-year-old daughter, Sara, was a flight attendant on American Airlines Flight 11, the first plane to strike the World Trade Center, said he was not deterred by the settlements, which were filed Monday in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
 ''The frustrating thing is not having a trial date,'' he said yesterday. ''The wheels of justice turn excruciatingly slow. It doesn't change my mind any. My desire and goal is to try to find some answers. I want to know why Abdulaziz Alomari and Mohamed Atta were allowed to walk on planes in Portland, Me., with prohibited weapons. I want somebody to tell me why that happened.'' 
 The 14 settlements came a few days after the families won a ruling in Federal District Court in Manhattan that would have allowed a jury to hear a few minutes of a cockpit recording that captured the sounds of passengers trying to retake control of United Airlines Flight 93 before it crashed into a field in Pennsylvania.
 Donald Migliori, a lawyer whose firm was involved in negotiating all of the settlements, said yesterday that Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein's ruling on the recording last week had moved settlement talks forward. He said it became clear that jurors would hear evidence that passengers were aware the plane had been hijacked and had reacted heroically. 
 ''It was a clear indication of where the case was going,'' Mr. Migliori said. ''The recording showed they were conscious and aware of the plane being hijacked and the last five minutes of struggle, heroism and flight.''
 All of the latest settlements involved United Airlines and the two security companies, Argenbright and Huntleigh. Six of them involved Flight 93, which crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pa., as passengers stormed the cockpit. The eight other cases involved United Flight 175, which hit the south tower. 
 Only 21 cases now remain of the original 95 cases filed on behalf of 96 victims in federal court, lawyers said. The rest have been settled or dismissed.
 The rush of settlements leaves open the question of whether any trials will take place. The settlements also force the remaining families to grapple with their motivations in suing and whether they are willing to continue waiting for trial.
 Several of the families have said in interviews that their motives were not just economic. They have said that they wanted accountability from those they considered responsible for the attacks -- including the two airlines; the airport security companies; Boeing, which manufactured the aircraft; and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owned the World Trade Center.
 Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said it was common for settlements to mount as the pressure of a trial approached. But he predicted some holdouts. 
 ''I think the dynamics here may be different from what I would call more garden variety kind of tort litigation,'' he said. ''It doesn't seem this is entirely driven by money, though it may be for some people. People want to tell their stories and want to find out as much as they can in court.''
 Mr. Migliori, whose firm, Motley Rice, is counsel or co-counsel in the remaining 21 cases, said he expected that some families, especially those who had relatives who died in the planes that struck the twin towers, would insist on a trial.
 The terms of the settlements were sealed. But Mr. Migliori said the families felt vindicated. He said they ''had reached a point where they were satisfied that the mix of their motivations -- from compensation to accountability, to answers -- was satisfied.''
 Joseph Wayland, a lawyer for the defendants, did not return a call for comment.
 The latest round of settlements included the case of Patrick Driscoll, 70, of Carmel, N.Y., a retired research director at Bell Communications who was on Flight 93. His case was scheduled to become the first to go to trial on Monday. In a statement after the settlement, Mr. Driscoll's widow, Adelaide, said that documents uncovered during the investigation before trial had ''helped to expose aviation security weakness.'' She did not elaborate.
 The first trial is now scheduled to begin Nov. 5, in the case of Dr. Paul Ambrose, a passenger on American Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon. Dr. Ambrose, 32, was a physician and adviser to the office of the surgeon general. His parents have sued.
 In order to sue, the families had to forgo a settlement from the federal September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001. Many of the plaintiffs argued that the fund shortchanged certain classes of people -- children, retired people and very high earners -- and did not sufficiently account for the suffering of the victims and their families. The fund awarded an average of $2 million to the families of 2,880 people killed in the attacks.
 ''I think it's fair to say that the folks that chose litigation knew they were going to get compensated whether they went into litigation or went into the fund,'' Mr. Migliori said. ''But uniformly it was understood and appreciated that the fund was not going to provide the same level of compensation as litigation.''
 Mr. Migliori said the remaining 21 cases consist of one passenger on United Flight 93; 15 cases involving American Flight 77; three passengers killed on American Flight 11; and two passengers killed on United Flight 175.
 The settlements seemed to vindicate Judge Hellerstein's strategy in ordering trials to determine damages before a trial to determine liability, a reversal of the usual order. In a pretrial conference on Sept. 11, the sixth anniversary of the attacks, Judge Hellerstein tried to explain his strategy. He said he did not want anyone to reduce the issue to money, and he expressed frustration that government resistance to releasing ''sensitive security information'' had delayed the preparation for a liability trial.
 He urged the survivors to ''choose life.''
 ''The alternative of giving in to the problems and delays and impasses in the world of sensitive security information is the way that I found unacceptable because, in many respects, it is a surrender to difficulty,'' he said. ''And so this may be a way, not a popular way, not a way free from criticism, but a way to get on.''

HEADLINE: A Lurid Tale From 1857 Is Revived In Granite

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
Back in 1857, they were the hottest names in old New-York. Harvey Burdell and Emma Cunningham -- the violent, rapacious and brutally murdered society dentist and his scheming and probably murderous mistress, mutual antagonists in the most lurid true-crime drama of the age.
 For well over a century, the pair, essentially disowned by their families, lay interred in unmarked graves a few hundred yards from each other in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, their whereabouts known only to a few history buffs. 
 No longer. Yesterday, before a rapt if small audience of retrospective voyeurs, two sparkling granite headstones were unveiled: Harvey Burdell, 1811-1857. And Emma Augusta Hempstead Cunningham, 1818-1887. ''May God rest her troubled soul,'' reads the inscription. 
 The stones -- and Mrs. Cunningham's epitaph -- are the doing of an amateur historian sufficiently obsessed with the case to spend the last seven years writing a book about it. 
 The man, Benjamin Feldman, a retired lawyer, real estate developer and Yiddishist, insisted that no endorsement of the couple's evil ways was implied.
 ''It's not a question of honoring them,'' Mr. Feldman, a thin, ponytailed man with the bearing of a merry undertaker, said after the graveside service, news of which was published yesterday by AM New York. ''It's a question of what in Hebrew is called 't'chiyat ha-metim' -- raising the dead. You enlarge all of us when you bring these stories back to life.'' 
 And what a story. In their ever-spiraling battle of bad faith and faithlessness, the two lovers managed to embody many of the ills of the age: the rampant vice and political corruption, the straitened economic and sexual circumstances of women and the destabilizing influence of new wealth on traditional social structures. 
 The tale, as lovingly told by Mr. Feldman in his book, ''Butchery on Bond Street,'' boils down to this: Harvey Burdell was a dentist of humble background who built a thriving practice in his four-story town house at 31 Bond Street, midway between the vice dens of the Bowery and the glitzier honky-tonk of lower Broadway. In his spare time, Dr. Burdell, who was divorced, enjoyed gambling, sexual predation and real estate swindling.
 Emma Cunningham was a young widow with five children and was desperately seeking a man who could support her and her brood in the manner to which she had grown accustomed. She had been married to a distiller who had squandered most of his family's fortune.
 No one alive knows precisely how Emma met Harvey, but once they got together, in or around 1854, things got pretty intense. They returned from a whirlwind trip to Saratoga Springs, N.Y., with Mrs. Cunningham pregnant. She wanted to keep the baby. He did not. She had an abortion, possibly performed by him.
 Nothing if not persistent, Mrs. Cunningham insinuated herself into the dentist's household as the landlady of the rooming house he ran out of his building. They continued their dalliance. She claimed he raped her twice, according to court papers.
 ''It was not a comfortable relationship,'' Mr. Feldman observed.
 Mrs. Cunningham tried everything to get Dr. Burdell to agree to tie the knot. She had him arrested for breach of promise to marry. In secret, she did marry a man who told the minister he was Harvey Burdell, but who was almost undoubtedly an impostor.
 Three months after the ceremony, on Jan. 31, 1857, Dr. Burdell was found dead in his dental clinic. More precisely, according to The New-York Daily Times, ''the body was lying upon the floor, shockingly mutilated, and surrounded with clots of blood, and the door and walls of the room besmeared with blood.''
 Not to be outdone, The New York Herald described 6 of the 15 stab wounds. ''Twice the steel had pierced the heart, twice the lungs had been reached with the deadly point of the stiletto, while the jugular vein and the carotid artery were both severed,'' it said, according to Mr. Feldman's book.
 Then the case really took off. The coroner's inquest was held in Dr. Burdell's office, with witnesses testifying in the chair where his patients had recently sat. A recommendation that one of the dead man's eyeballs be excised and his retina examined for traces of what, or whom, he saw in his dying moments was proposed and discarded. Mrs. Cunningham threw herself on the open coffin and cried, ''Oh, I wish to God you could speak and tell who done it.''
 More than 8,000 people tried to cram into Grace Church on Broadway at 10th Street for his funeral. Soon after, she was charged with the murder. There being no witnesses, and her lawyer arguing successfully that a member of the weaker sex afflicted with rheumatism was incapable of such a brutal attack, she was acquitted. (Mr. Feldman said he believed that Mrs. Cunningham had a prominent role in the murder even if she did not commit it herself.)
 Set free, Mrs. Cunningham tackled her next mission: obtaining Dr. Burdell's estate, estimated at $80,000. But her claim to be carrying his child was proven false when she was caught taking delivery of another woman's baby to call her own. And her insistence that she had married Dr. Burdell similarly unraveled in the face of testimony that another paramour had been seen buying a toupee and false whiskers the day of the wedding in order to resemble Dr. Burdell.
 Emma Cunningham died a pauper at the age of 69. Harvey Burdell's murder was never solved. Both were eventually forgotten, until Jeffrey I. Richman, the historian of Green-Wood Cemetery, read an account of the case and included it in a book about the cemetery. Mr. Feldman bought the book in 2000, and a fixation was born. Mr. Feldman and the cemetery split the $6,500 cost of the grave markers.
 Yesterday, as a large spider crept across Emma Cunningham's tombstone in the crisp sunlight, Mr. Feldman recalled his excitement when he first read the twisted tale of Harvey Burdell and Emma Cunningham.
 ''The interplay between them,'' he said, ''is one of the most hideous, dysfunctional, psychopathic couplings between man and woman that I've ever read. I knew I had to see their graves appropriately marked.''

HEADLINE: British Central Bank Adds More Funds in Credit Crisis

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 18 

 BODY:
Britain's central bank on Tuesday doubled the amount of emergency loan money available to commercial banks caught short in the global credit squeeze -- curbing a surge in overnight borrowing costs but fueling criticism that the central bank's governor was reversing his own policy against bailouts.
 It lent $:4.4 billion ($8.9 billion) at its benchmark interest rate of 5.75 percent and said it would offer the same amount on Thursday in seven-day loans to help strengthen confidence in the financial system. 
 The step followed an increase in the overnight lending rate that banks charge one another, to 6.47 percent, the highest level in four months and a sign that lenders were still unsettled by repercussions from the mortgage market turmoil that began in the United States. After the infusion, the overnight rate subsided to just over 6 percent.
 The action was intended to protect the British economy from choking on rising borrowing costs. The economy has grown in recent years on the strength of a flourishing financial services market and record consumer debt, among other things.
 Pressure for action by the central bank governor, Mervyn King, increased after depositors withdrew billions of pounds in savings from Northern Rock, a British mortgage lender that faced a liquidity crisis after the credit markets dried up. Shares of other British lenders, especially those with similar business models, also started to fall.
 ''Something had to be done to contain the situation after some signs of contagion,'' said Howard Archer, an economist at Global Insight in London.
 But Mr. King found himself subject to criticism for what some analysts saw as a reversal of his position, staked out just last week, not to bail out banks that fell victim to their own excessive lending policies. He had distanced himself from the looser-money approach taken by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve, and cautioned about what is known as moral hazard -- the view that bailing out those with risky lending practices only encourages more risky practices in the future.
 Then the government announced this week that the central bank, the Bank of England, would guarantee the deposits of Northern Rock's customers, should it collapse, and it offered the same support to other lenders in a similar situation.
 ''The decisive action we have taken means that the deposits of Northern Rock customers are guaranteed,'' Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Tuesday in his first public comments on the bank's woes, as reported by The Associated Press. ''It is because of the strength of our economy that we have been able to take these measures.''
 Mr. Archer said that this offer ''does risk opening the floodgates'' but that the step was intended more to ''stabilize the situation and then maybe come up with future regulation or monitoring system to avoid this ever happening again.''
 The assurances helped shares in Northern Rock and other banks rebound Tuesday. Northern Rock rose 8.2 percent after dropping 35 percent on Monday. Other banking shares, including those of Barclays, in London, and BNP Paribas, in Paris, also advanced.
 The British regulator, the Financial Services Authority, acknowledged Tuesday that lessons needed to be learned from the Northern Rock situation.
 ''Following the events of the last few days, the authorities will be looking at what measures can be taken to ensure that consumers can have confidence that their deposits in our banks and building societies are safe,'' the agency said.

HEADLINE: Vacancy Rate Shrinking in New Jersey Bellwether

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
The most visible office buildings in New Jersey are the towers along the Hudson River, but professionals say they do not accurately tell the story of the office market in the state. 
 ''The waterfront really isn't New Jersey,'' said James L. Frank, an executive director of Cushman & Wakefield. ''It goes with Manhattan. The New York City market is running on high octane right now, and that carries over to the Gold Coast.''
 To get a better picture, Mr. Frank suggests this: Think about Parsippany. The Parsippany market, which has been making a slow but steady climb from the doldrums in the seven years since the dot-com collapse and the six years since Sept. 11, 2001, is a far better bellwether for New Jersey -- and perhaps the country, according to Mr. Frank and Cushman's market analysts. 
 With a total of 11.7 million square feet of commercial office space, Parsippany is the state's third-largest office market, after the Hudson County waterfront and Newark. Parsippany is also the largest suburban office market in a state dominated by suburban space.
 It offers ample highway access -- Interstates 287 and 80, and Routes 46, 10, and 202 are all close -- and what is considered a deep pool of skilled labor.
 Parsippany's office vacancy rate shot up to 25 percent in 2001 from a low of less than 10 percent in 1999. This summer, the overall vacancy rate remained high -- 16 percent to 20 percent, according to various real estate firms.
 But for Class A space -- in the newest and best-quality buildings -- the vacancy rate was down to 12.7 percent, Cushman reported.
 While several Class A buildings that have been vacant for years remain on the market, two were recently rented for use by health care companies. IMS Health has leased a 120,000-square-foot office building in the Waterview Corporate Park, with an option to buy. Also, a 105,000-square-foot building at 8 Sylvan Way, which is being refurbished by its owner, the Hampshire Companies, has just been leased to the Medicines Company, according to two brokers who work in the marketplace.
 Elsewhere, the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche is set to be the anchor tenant at 100 Kimball Drive, the only new building to rise in Parsippany since 2000. It is a 175,000-square-foot brick-faced structure at the Center of Morris County office park that was built speculatively by the Gale Real Estate Services Company (part of Mack-Cali Realty).
 ''The rent the company will be paying is in the mid-s$30 per square foot, clearly the highest in the neighborhood,'' said Mark Yeager, president of Gale.
 In fact, Gale broke ground yesterdayon another speculative building in the complex. The three-story 100,000-square-foot structure at 100 Jefferson Road.
 In December, when Deloitte & Touche moves out of its existing office at 2 Hilton Court in the same office park, the space will be taken by Daiichi Sankyo, the Japanese pharmaceutical company, to double its space in the building.
 This year, the Wyndham Worldwide Corporation announced that it would also expand its offices in Parsippany by moving into a 250,000-square-foot office being constructed for it.
 For Parsippany as a whole, Cushman's analysts now predict that Class A vacancies will dip below 10 percent within the next year to 18 months.
 With the dearth of new construction in the last six years and more than a dozen companies reported to be looking to expand in Parsippany or move there, Mr. Frank says the local market is headed for a comeback.
 ''As is typical, once the bigger and more traditionally dominant markets show notable improvement,'' Mr. Frank said, ''the recovery will spread to peripheral areas. This is true for New Jersey, and true for the country.''
 His view is not universally held. Peter Eppie, executive vice president of SJP Properties, the Parsippany-based developer and owner of Morris Corporate Center there, said his company would not begin any speculative development on property it owns because the market still has ''no rhythm.''
 A CB Richard Ellis broker, Remy P. deVarenne, said, ''I totally disagree that Parsippany is coming back.''
 ''It is a diverse market,'' Mr. deVarenne said, ''but the key drivers are the pharmaceutical and financial service industries -- and both of those are in trouble. Wall Street is in trouble with the credit crunch, and Big Pharma is undergoing significant consolidation.''
 Mr. deVarenne cited Johnson & Johnson's acquisition of Pfizer's health care division last year, which has led Pfizer to seek the sale of more than half its new 1.2-million-square-foot office space in Morris Plains -- less than a mile from Parsippany.
 He also said that Wyndham's move to a new building would leave about 135,000 square feet of empty space at its old office.
 Mr. deVarenne and Mr. Eppie both also mentioned that the investment banking firm Bear Stearns, which had been shopping for space in Parsippany, appears to be unlikely to move ahead with that, given some recent setbacks in its business.
 But Mr. Frank countered that when all the moves by tenants were calculated, the trend was in the right direction. ''The general point is,'' he said, ''that despite these blows and negative market forces, the Parsippany market has been growing.''

WASHINGTON
 It's a lost art, slinking away.
 Now the fashion is slinking back.
 Nobody wants to simply admit they made a mistake and disappear for awhile. Nobody even wants to use the weasel words: ''Mistakes were made.'' No, far better to pop right back up and get in the face of those who were savoring your absence.
 We should think of a name for this appalling modern phenomenon. Kissingering, perhaps. 
 In Las Vegas, there's the loathsome O.J., a proper candidate for shunning and stun-gunning, barging back into the picture.
 And on Capitol Hill, Larry Craig shocked mortified Republicans by bounding into their weekly lunch. You'd think the conservative 62-year-old Idaho senator would have some shame, going from fervently opposing gay rights to provocatively tapping his toe in a Minneapolis airport toilet. (The toilet stall, now known as the Larry Craig bathroom, has become a hot local tourist attraction.)
 But no.
 As though Republicans don't have enough problems, Mr. Craig said he is ready to go back to work while the legal hotshots he hired appeal his case. He even cast a couple votes, one against D.C. voting rights. (This creep gets to decide about my representation?)
 Even if President Bush is ''the cockiest guy'' around, as the former Mexican President Vicente Fox writes in a new memoir critical of W.'s ''grade-school-level'' Spanish and his grade-school-level Iraq policy, he can't be feeling good about the barbs being hurled his way by former supporters and enablers.
 Rummy's back in the news, giving interviews about a planned memoir and foundation designed to encourage ''reasoned and civil debate'' about global challenges and to spur more young people to go into government.
 It's rich. Maybe more young people would go into government if they didn't have to work for devious bullies like Rummy who make huge life-and-death mistakes and then don't apologize. 
 In The Washington Post, he blamed the press and Congress for creating an inhospitable atmosphere that drives good people away from public service. Maybe that's why he and his evil twin, Dick Cheney, did their best to undermine the constitutional system of checks and balances so they could get more fine young people to serve. 
 Does the man blamed for creating civil disorder in Iraq even know what the word ''civil'' means? Wasn't he the prickly Pentagon chief who got furious with anyone who didn't agree with him on ''global challenges''? 
 He shoved Gen. Eric Shinseki into retirement -- and failed to show up at his retirement party -- after the good general correctly told Congress that it would take several hundred thousand troops to invade and control Iraq. And he snubbed the German defense minister when Germany joined the Coalition of the Unwilling.
 Interviewed by GQ's Lisa DePaulo on his ranch in Taos, N.M., with another mule named Gus nearby, the ''75-year-old package of waning testosterone,'' as the writer called him, was asked if he misses W. Offering a wry smile, he replied, ''Um, no.''
 He now treats the son with the same contempt he treated the father with, which is why it's so odd that the son hired his dad's nemesis in the first place.
 He actually had the gall to imply to Ms. DePaulo that he was out of the loop on Iraq and dragged out a copy of a memo he had written outlining all the things that could go wrong.
 In fact, he was the one, right after 9/11, who began pushing to go after Saddam. He and Cheney were orchestrating the invasion from the start, guiding the dauphin with warnings about how weak he would seem if he let Saddam mock him.
 The ultimate bureaucratic infighter wrote the memo as part of his Socratic strategy, asking a lot of questions when he was already pushing to go into Iraq. He never did any contingency planning in case those things went wrong; the memo was there simply so that someday he could pull it out for a reporter.
 In the same issue of GQ, Colin Powell tried to build up the objections he made to the president, too, in an interview with Walter Isaacson. But nobody's buying. 
 Even though he rubber-stamped W.'s tax cuts, Alan Greenspan is now upbraiding the president and vice president for profligate spending and putting politics ahead of sound economics.
 He also says in his new memoir that ''the Iraq war is largely about oil,'' telling Bob Woodward that he had privately told W. and Cheney that ousting Saddam was ''essential'' to keeping world oil supplies safe.
 Irrational exuberance, indeed.

HEADLINE: Fed Cuts Rate Half Point, And Stock Markets Soar

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve rolled out its most powerful interest rate weapon on Tuesday in a bid to stop the turmoil in housing and financial markets from bringing down the overall economy.
 But even as stock markets soared in a thunderous rally, the Fed carefully stopped short of implying any commitment to reduce rates even more in the months ahead. Indeed, policy makers cautioned that they still have lingering worries about inflation -- a concern that would weigh against stimulating the economy further with cheaper money.
 In reducing its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large one-half percentage point, to 4.75 percent from 5.25 percent, the central bank made it clear that policy makers viewed the turbulence and disruptions of the past couple of months as too dangerous to ignore. 
 The reaction in stock markets was ecstatic: the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 200 points almost instantly and ended the day up 335 points, or 2.51 percent, at 13,739.39. 
 The move was the Fed's first rate reduction of any kind in four years, the steepest in nearly five years and its most abrupt reversal of course since January 2001, when policy makers sharply cut rates at an unscheduled emergency meeting just before the last recession. 
 ''Shock therapy,'' summed up Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers.
 For consumers, the Fed's move could mean lower borrowing costs for mortgages and automobile loans. But the impact may be muted, because investors remain deeply anxious about the credit quality of mortgages and other long-term loans. The main problem in the last month has not been high rates so much as the availability of capital to complete deals.
 Analysts described the Fed's action as a bold attempt to restore confidence, with a quieter caveat that investors and consumers should not assume the certainty of more painkillers later this year.
 ''The important policy debate now centers on the future interest rate path, but Fed officials left that more ambiguous,'' said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley.
 Indeed, while many on Wall Street have been clamoring for an aggressive rate cut, some economists had warned against it, saying that it might send the wrong signal by bailing out those who contributed to the housing bubble and encourage future market excesses.
 In both the bold stroke and the fine print, the Fed's move offered a revealing hint about Ben. S. Bernanke, the former professor from Princeton who took over as Fed chairman last year.
 Mr. Bernanke, a champion of steady rules to guide monetary policy, has long been seen as more skeptical about reacting to financial turbulence than his predecessor, Alan Greenspan. 
 Mr. Bernanke, for example, made it clear that he did not want to rescue investors or real estate speculators who made bad decisions. But in shielding the economy from a downturn, the Fed will inevitably be helping some of the very people Mr. Bernanke did not want to help. 
 What seems to have driven Mr. Bernanke to act more boldly, analysts said, was the jolt from the Labor Department's unexpectedly poor employment report for August, which showed that the nation had lost jobs for the first time in four years.
 Still, Mr. Bernanke's move was nothing if not a Greenspanian display of ''discretionary'' policy in response to trouble but before the signs of an economic downturn were unambiguous. And in doing so, he obtained unanimous agreement from other board members, even though some Fed officials have been dubious about the need for a rescue.
 The Fed's course change has been under way since early August, when fears about huge losses on subprime mortgage loans and a continued downturn in housing caused a much broader panic in credit markets. 
 The resulting credit tightness has now affected all but the safest home mortgages and has also greatly reduced the ability of private equity funds and hedge funds to borrow money at low rates. Many banks, which had been planning to resell their loans into the giant market for tradable commercial debt securities, are now being forced to absorb loans that the securities markets will no longer take. 
 In the rate cut and an accompanying statement, the central bank acknowledged that the risks of a recession were too big to ignore.
 ''The tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and restrain economic growth more generally,'' the Fed's policy-making committee said in its statement. ''Today's action is intended to forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets.''
 Leaving the door open for the possibility of additional rate cuts, the central bank said it would ''continue to assess'' the economic outlook and ''act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.''
 But while Fed policy makers abandoned previous statements that the risk of inflation was their ''predominant concern,'' they did not say that the risk of a downturn had replaced inflation as their main worry. Rather, they spoke of ''uncertainty'' and left it at that.
 ''The Fed kept its cards much closer to its vest than anyone would have guessed,'' said David Rosenberg, chief North American economist for Merrill Lynch. ''It's not at all clear they think they have more to do.''
 Trading among investors indicated that Wall Street expects the central bank to keep cutting rates. Many analysts contend that it needs to cut twice as deeply as it has so far by early next year.
 And in a sign that the politics of rate-cutting could become more bruising, at least one prominent Democrat quickly criticized the Fed's cautionary warning about inflation at a time of slowing growth. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he was ''surprised'' by the Fed's statement.
 ''I hope, in this instance, that markets and consumers will pay more attention to what the F.O.M.C. did than to what it said,'' Mr. Frank added, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates.
 In a separate move to bolster the banking system, the Fed also said that it had cut its discount lending rate, which applies to short-term emergency loans to banks, by a half a percentage point, to 5.25 percent.
 As in 2001, the Fed's move came after a panic in financial markets and the collapse of a speculative bubble. Today, the panic is in credit markets unnerved by dubious mortgages on inflated housing prices. Back then, it was the stock market that was in trouble, initially because the air went out of inflated dot-com stocks.
 But the debate within the Fed was all about risk probabilities: what were the odds that the twin meltdowns in housing and mortgage markets would tip the overall economy into a recession?
 If policy makers cut rates too cautiously, they risk a recession; if they cut them too much or too early, they risk stoking inflation.
 Ever since the jobs data was released this month, it seemed clear that Fed policy makers were no longer debating whether to reduce rates but how much to lower them. A smaller rate reduction posed a risk of moving too slowly if the economy was indeed in danger of stalling. But a bigger rate reduction could have been taken as a sign of Fed panic, and it added to the risk of stoking inflationary pressures that the central bank had just begun to tamp down.
 Just a few hours before the central bank announced its decision, new statistics indicated that the pace of home foreclosures was accelerating.
 RealtyTrac of Irvine, Calif., reported that the number of foreclosure filings -- from default notices and auction sale notices to bank repossessions -- was 36 percent higher in August than in July and 115 percent higher than one year ago.
 But except for the housing downturn, which Fed officials admit is much more severe than they had expected, the evidence of a recession in the real economy is indecisive. Global economic growth is much stronger than in 2001, and American exports have climbed about 14 percent over the last year. 
 Instead of the United States being the world's engine of growth, the global economy could now become the engine of American growth.
 Many Wall Street economists place the odds of a recession at about one-in-three or somewhat higher. Mr. Greenspan puts the odds at somewhat more than the one-in-three that he estimated earlier this year. 
 On Aug. 17, the Federal Reserve moved to ease the liquidity crisis by encouraging banks to borrow money through its discount window, an outlet originally created as an emergency source of overnight funding for banks in a cash squeeze. 
 But by most accounts, the turmoil in the credit markets has abated very little. The market for subprime mortgages has all but disappeared and demand for all forms of asset-backed commercial paper -- which are securities backed by mortgages, credit card debt and company receivables -- remains very weak.

HEADLINE: A Campaign Spotlight on Health Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Wary of Past, Clinton Unveils a Health Plan'' (front page, Sept. 18):
 Hillary Rodham Clinton's plan is like all the health plans other candidates have put forth. They have sold out to the marketplace. 
 Health care should be a social right of a civilized society, and it should not be for sale. All of our citizens should be entitled to a federally financed health care program like Medicare, which currently covers us old people.

 Yellow Springs, Ohio, Sept. 18, 2007
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks, in his Sept. 18 column, ''Hillary Clinton, From Revolution to Evolution,'' notes that a single-payer health system is out of touch with the American values of choice and individual freedom. 
 Before I was covered by Medicare (a single-payer system), my employer-supplied private health plan provided me with limited choice and, hence, limited individual freedom. Now, under Medicare, my choices have increased exponentially. 
 It's just not true that the vast majority of private health plans provide more choice than Medicare's single-payer system. In fact, quite the opposite is true. Bruce Shames
 New York, Sept. 18, 2007
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks writes of Hillary Rodham Clinton's new health care plan with considerable warmth, but readers should look at the cold hard facts:
 The private insurance industry is siphoning off 20 to 30 cents of every health care dollar for administrative costs, including executive salaries and profits. Meanwhile, taxpayer-financed, government-run Medicare holds overhead near 3 percent.
 To those who think that the Clinton plan will cover everyone and control costs, Mr. Brooks adds a note of caution: ''Then, there are the insurance companies, the designated betes noires of her plan. They are commanded to insure everybody, but they'll probably be extremely creative in finding ways to not insure high-risk people who will cost them money.'' 
 In boasting of her alliances with private insurers, Senator Clinton might recall the old adage, ''Lie down with betes noires ...'' Harriette Seiler

 David Brooks could be right to warn about people taking advantage of free government medical care. How else to explain George W. Bush's colonoscopy at Camp David? What if everyone did that? Marcia Amsterdam
 New York, Sept. 18, 2007
 To the Editor:
 I would like to ask President Bush: What is wrong with government-run health care for every American? My patients have often brought letters from insurance companies to me -- letters beginning, ''We are sorry to inform you that you do not qualify for health insurance.'' 
 This should not happen in a civilized country in the 21st century. Medicare is not perfect, but it has a 2 to 3 percent overhead, compared with the 20 percent or more off the top that insurance companies use to advertise and to pay employees to find ways to deny coverage. 
 I hope that our elected officials, both Democratic and Republican, will find the moral courage and the will to pass legislation that will provide health care for every American in spite of Mr. Bush's threats of veto. 
 L. Anne Owens, M.D.
 Bloomington, Ind., Sept. 18, 2007
 To the Editor:
 ''Unveiling Health Care 2.0, Again'' (Week in Review, Sept. 16) is right. Only innocents believe that meaningful health care reform will occur simply because the American people want it and the presidential candidates promote it. 
 Health care economists agree that as much as half of the industry's costs is waste, but that excess constitutes a significant portion of the financial baselines of most health care organizations. 
 The health care industry, the nation's largest economic sector, spent $350 million lobbying Congress in 2006, more than any other sector. They won't willingly abide reforms that compromise their profitability.
 Reform will occur only if America's non-health care business leaders recognize that it is a critical concern for them and us. By pooling their influence, they could overwhelm the health care lobby and drive changes that re-establish American health care's stability and sustainability. Brian R. Klepper

 Re ''San Francisco to Offer Care for Every Uninsured Adult'' (front page, Sept. 14):
 I am proud to live in a city with leaders choosing social justice and economic good sense. 
 You question whether San Francisco's plan can be replicated elsewhere. Yet such a system of providing universal health coverage has already been ''replicated'' by every other industrialized nation in the world! 
 When will our national leaders wake up and realize what the voters already know? Our bloated and expensive system leads to increased health disparities suffered by the uninsured, who live in fear of illness and its accompanying financial burden. If our current leaders do not have the courage to implement guaranteed health insurance for all, we must make every effort to elect those who will. Ann Magruder

HEADLINE: Obama Proposes Tax Cut for Middle Class and Retirees

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama proposed a plan on Tuesday to provide at least $80 billion a year in tax cuts to middle-class workers, homeowners and retirees, saying if he was elected president he would ''end the preferential treatment that's built into our tax code.''
 Mr. Obama said he would give a $500 tax credit to more than 150 million workers, create a tax credit for homeowners who do not itemize their deductions and eliminate income taxes for older taxpayers who make less than $50,000 a year. To pay for the plan, he said he would raise capital gains taxes on the wealthy, close corporate loopholes and abolish tax breaks that have saved hedge fund and private equity managers billions of dollars. 
 ''If you talk about this in polite company, sooner or later you'll get accused of waging class warfare,'' Mr. Obama said. ''As if it's distasteful to point out that some C.E.O.'s make more in 10 minutes than a worker makes in 10 months.''
 As he pursues the Democratic presidential nomination, Mr. Obama, of Illinois, is seeking to cast himself as an advocate for working Americans, arguing against special interests that he says have contributed to a widening gap between the rich and the middle class and poor. He said the nation's ''social compact is starting to crumble.''
 In an address to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, Mr. Obama also proposed major simplifications to the tax system, with a goal of making basic tax filing a five-minute exercise. For about 40 million Americans without complex taxes, he said, the government would essentially send a bill based on electronic information from employers and banks.
 In a 20-minute speech, which was billed as ''Obama's Tax Fairness Plan,'' the senator provided few details and did not touch upon the alternative minimum tax, a growing burden for middle-class taxpayers. Advisers said the speech on Tuesday was not intended to address that tax.
 While Mr. Obama said he had not settled on how high to raise the capital gains rates, he added that he would ''adjust the top dividends and capital gains rate to something closer to -- but no greater than -- the rates Ronald Reagan set in 1986.'' Later, aides said the top rates would be 20 percent to 28 percent. Most people now pay 15 percent on capital gains, with lower-income people eligible for a 5 percent rate.
 Conservatives, who are already warning that a Democrat in the White House would endanger the economy by raising taxes, said Mr. Obama's plan posed a particular risk by increasing the rate on capital gains for many taxpayers, a step they said would choke off the investment the economy needs to expand.
 ''Barack Obama essentially announced his intention to reverse the economic success of the past couple of years by eliminating the most pro-growth aspects of the 2003 tax cuts,'' said Pat Toomey, president of the Club for Growth, the conservative, antitax advocacy group. 
 Mr. Obama's plan would essentially increase tax rates on the wealthy and some corporations to reduce taxes on lower- and middle-income people. He called for a credit of $500 per person -- or $1,000 per family -- to offset some payroll taxes. Advisers said the credit would be phased out for income levels exceeding $150,000. The plan also called for extending a mortgage credit to taxpayers who do not itemize, generating about $500 in savings for 10 million people.
 Finally, by eliminating income taxes for older Americans earning less than $50,000 a year, Mr. Obama said 22 million people would no longer need to file an income tax return. And seven million Americans, he said, would receive a tax cut of about $1,400.

HEADLINE: Dubai to Buy Large Stake In Nasdaq

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
The government-controlled stock exchange in Dubai, the fast-growing Middle East business center, is expected to announce today in Stockholm that it plans to take significant ownership in the Nasdaq stock exchange in New York and the London Stock Exchange, people who have been briefed on the transaction said last night.
 If the deal is completed, Dubai would become the first Middle East government to own a large stake in an American stock exchange. It also is expected to become the largest single investor in Nasdaq. 
 The deal by the Borse Dubai would give Dubai a stake of 20 percent to 30 percent in Nasdaq, the largest electronic stock market in America, and about 30 percent in the London Stock Exchange, according to people who have been briefed. 
 In exchange, Dubai would hand over to Nasdaq the OMX Group, a stock exchange based in Stockholm that also operates in Helsinki, Copenhagen and several other countries in Scandinavia and the Baltic States. 
 With a 17 percent share, Horizon Asset Management of Seattle is now Nasdaq's largest investor, according to the exchange. 
 Reports of a possible deal brought questions last night from lawmakers in Washington about potential compromises to security in the United States. The concerns were similar to those raised more than a year ago when another Dubai-owned company, DP World, tried to buy a company that managed port operations around the United States, and in 2005, when the Chinese oil company, Cnooc, tried to buy its American rival, Unocal. Both efforts were abandoned under pressure from Congress.
 Dubai is the commercial and financial center of the United Arab Emirates on the Persian Gulf and has been cited as a transit point for money used to finance terrorism.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who helped lead the opposition to Dubai's investment in the American ports, said last night that the deal, which would make Dubai a major player in New York finance, would ''raise serious questions that have to be answered.''
 ''Should any government own any part of a major U.S. stock exchange?'' asked Mr. Schumer, who is on the banking and finance committees in the Senate and is the chairman of the joint House and Senate economic committee. 
 A spokeswoman for Nasdaq did not return phone calls seeking comment and executives in Dubai could not be reached.
 Borse Dubai plans to acquire its stakes in the New York and London exchanges through an elaborate series of steps growing out of its success in outbidding Nasdaq for the OMX Group for about $4 billion. 
 In the deal that is expected to be announced today, Borse Dubai will complete the purchase of the OMX Group and then hand it over to Nasdaq in exchange for at least a 19 percent share in the New York exchange and Nasdaq's stake of about 30 percent in the London Stock Exchange, which is valued at about $1.8 billion.
 Nasdaq has been struggling to get a foothold in Europe and watched as a rival, the NYSE Group, merged with Euronext to form a global exchange company. Stock markets around the world are combining or buying stakes in each other to meet clients' demands to trade shares of companies anywhere, at a faster pace, across different asset classes and for less money. Combinations also help them save costs in an industry where the largest expense is developing the technology to run trading platforms.
 But Nasdaq's efforts to expand have been rebuffed. It bought a 30 percent share in the London Stock Exchange, but its hostile bids to take over the entire London operation were rejected.
 Then in May, Nasdaq announced that it had reached agreement to buy the OMX Group for $3.7 billion. But in August, Borse Dubai, the parent company of the Dubai International Financial Exchange, which includes the former Dubai Financial Markets, came in with a higher bid.

HEADLINE: O.T. Isn't as Simple as Telling Time

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN. 
E-mail: Belkin@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A WOMAN in a Chicago workplace caused quite a stir recently when she submitted her time sheet. She had worked 800 hours of overtime in 17 weeks, meaning she had been on the job about 12 or 13 hours a day, seven days a week, January through April.
 Because the woman, Carla Bird, is an assistant at Oprah Winfrey's production company, Harpo Studios, and because some seemingly jealous co-workers spread the word to the news media, her $32,000 payout was the talk of those who pay attention to workload for a living. The work/life experts were predictably appalled that Ms. Bird had logged so many hours.
 And the labor lawyers?
 They were impressed -- that she had actually collected her overtime pay. 
 Time was when overtime was extra money for extra work, which in its simplest form it still is, but there is nothing simple about it anymore. In today's perpetual workplace, where downtime has merged with work time, where you can carry your office in your pocket, where collars are no longer distinctly blue or white, how does one measure overtime?
 Most states have dense rules about overtime, of course, and the federal government has the Fair Labor Standards Act, which says that unless you are an ''exempt worker'' you must be paid time and a half after a 40-hour workweek.
 It is worth noting that the language is backward when it comes to overtime. Usually exempt is a relief, as in exempt from jury duty. But here it means you are not entitled to overtime under the law. 
 The multibillion-dollar question is who is exempt and who gets paid. When the Fair Labor Standards Act was first written, when F.D.R. was president, it was fairly clear who was a worker and who was a manager, and who was a professional and who wasn't.
 But as the economy has moved from manufacturing toward service, professionals don't necessarily manage anymore and even low-level workers often need technical expertise, making the categories murkier.
 In 2003, the Bush administration set out to ''clarify'' the law, revising income-level tests in various job categories (above them you are a salaried manager and don't get overtime, below them you are not a manager and you do) and specifying that more than half a manager's time actually has to be spent managing. But greater clarity was not necessarily a result.
 ''All that's clear is that it clearly didn't work,'' said Robert Fox, the deputy director of Working America, founded four years ago by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to address the needs of working families who do not belong to unions.
 The most common question posted on the ''Ask a Lawyer'' section of the group's Web site, Mr. Fox said, is about overtime: ''Who's eligible? Who's exempt? What counts toward overtime?'' 
 Let's take those one at a time. The ''who's eligible, who's exempt?'' question is one increasingly heard in a courtroom. Lawsuits brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act, by employees claiming they had been illegally declared ineligible and demanding back overtime pay, have increased by 50 percent since the changes were made, mostly in the form of large class-action suits.
 Which leads to the question of ''what counts toward overtime?'' It used to be, for instance, that to do personal errands (go to the bank, shop, pick up groceries), you had to leave the office at lunch. Now you can do all that while sitting at your desk. So if you are spooning your yogurt and ordering from Amazon, you are on your lunch break, right? But what if you get an I.M. from the boss? Or an e-mail message from a client? And you respond? Are you working again?
 ''That counts as working time,'' said Mark Thierman, a plaintiffs lawyer in Reno, Nev., ''particularly if you don't feel you can turn around and say 'I'm on my lunch break and I'll get to it later.' If you have to jump on every e-mail that you get then you're on call, and that isn't a lunch break.''
 What if that same message comes over a BlackBerry or cellphone when you are technically off the clock? ''BlackBerry time is work time,'' said Dan McCoy, a partner in the employment practices group of Fenwick & West, a law firm. ''It absolutely counts.''
 The law has long and consistently excluded commuting from hours worked.
 But as commutes grow longer, and workers use time on the train (and, heaven help us, in the car) to tap on their laptop or BlackBerry, the exceptions are starting to define the rule. And while those most likely to be working while commuting are exempt-category workers like managers, experts say, the need to bring the office onto the bus is creeping into the lives of workers qualified for overtime, too. 
 Robin Bond, founder of Transition Strategies, an employment law firm in Wayne, Pa., said: ''If a nonexempt employee gets in his car and immediately gets on a conference call where his participation is required, or not stopped by management, that is work time. '' 
 So if so many of us qualify for overtime, and there are so many opportunities for overtime, why aren't more of us getting more extra pay?
 There are several reasons, all of which reveal much about the new realities of work.
 First is the practical fact that time worked outside of work is hard to track. There are electronic records of work calls, yes, and e-mail trails are time/date stamped, but the 5 minutes here, 15 minutes there don't often rise to the level of logged work time.
 ''It is daunting to keep an accurate record,'' said John Thompson, a partner in the Atlanta office of Fisher & Phillips, a labor and employment firm. ''In a wireless world nobody actually knows what the employee does or when he or she does it.''
 PUT another way, many workers themselves can't even separate when they are working from when they are not.
 A second reason is the prevalence of office culture that says overwork is rewarded with bragging rights, not money. It is illegal for a boss to send a message, directly or obliquely, that filing for overtime will be frowned upon, but it happens. 
 It is unclear exactly what took place with Ms. Bird and Harpo, because she did not return phone calls, but her co-workers were quoted in The New York Post as suggesting that only because she was a favorite could she get away with filing for so much overtime.
 Finally, experts say, there is the status factor.
 Plaintiffs lawyers have stopped being surprised by the fact that workers wrongly classified as ''exempt'' are reluctant to change their job title, because being a salaried manager, even at a loss of income, carries the intangible benefit of respect.
 Mr. Thierman, the lawyer from Reno, tells of a suit he brought and won against a brokerage firm, proving that employees were entitled to overtime. The company paid a substantial settlement, ''then went back to doing things the old way,'' he said.
 ''I asked their lawyer 'Don't they know we're just going to sue them again?' '' Mr. Thierman recalled. He said the opponent answered, ''They don't think they can go onto college campuses and tell people 'We pay hourly.' ''

HEADLINE: Decline in Retail Prices Offers Grace Note to Fed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Consumer prices dipped slightly in August as energy costs fell, keeping pace with the year's slowdown in inflation and offering some comfort to Federal Reserve officials after Tuesday's half-point cut in interest rates. 
 But some analysts, pointing to continuing increases in underlying inflation, warned that the threat of rising prices could return in the months ahead. 
 And while Wall Street remained positive yesterday, with the leading stock indexes recording modest gains, market watchers were divided about whether the Fed would be forced to take inflationary pressures into account as it considers whether to keep cutting rates. 
 The Consumer Price Index, which measures prices at the retail level, fell 0.1 percent in August, a Labor Department report released yesterday showed. Core inflation figures, which exclude food and energy, ticked up 0.2 percent, holding at the same pace as the previous month. A recent surge in crude oil prices to record levels could also increase future inflationary pressure. 
 The core inflation index is up 2.1 percent from a year earlier, and the index as a whole has risen 2 percent since last August.
 Most analysts seemed relieved that the figures were so benign. ''The Fed's cut yesterday would have been put into a little bit of doubt if you had an upside surprise on this number,'' said John Shin, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. Instead, the index came in just ahead of Wall Street forecasts.
 An upward tick in the index, Mr. Shin said, ''would have put the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility a little more in doubt.''
 The consumer inflation figures followed a report on Tuesday showing a 1.4 percent drop in prices at the producer level. Together, the reports suggested to a number of analysts that inflation worries would not stand in the way of future rate cuts. 
 But to others, the threat of inflation has not dissipated. 
 ''I think it's a bit of a mistake to assume that the inflation genie has been put back in the bottle,'' said Michael T. Darda, chief economist for MKM Partners, a hedge fund firm based in Greenwich, Conn. Mr. Darda argued that the month's drop in energy costs had skewed inflation figures, offering a falsely reassuring snapshot. 
 And the chief United States economist of Bear Stearns said he expected the Fed to reverse its rate cut early next year to stem rising core inflation. The economist, John Ryding, called the rate cut ''imprudent.''
 In another report, the Commerce Department said yesterday that housing starts and building permits dropped last month, led by a 3 percent slip in single-family homes -- another sign that housing would continue to be a drag on the economy. Residential housing projects were down 2.6 percent, continuing a trend of the last few months.
 Housing starts, reflecting the collapse in the home-borrowing market, are down nearly 20 percent over the last year, painting a bleak picture for residential construction industries.
 Housing costs, which are heavily weighted in the consumer price report, were virtually unchanged from last month, though household energy and utility prices dropped slightly. 
 Apparel costs fell, too, with men's and boys' apparel and footwear recording the biggest dips. But bad news was in store for the parents of stylish infants and toddlers looking for bargains: those clothing costs rose 0.3 percent.
 Textbooks, along with other educational books and supplies, continued to strain students' wallets, with costs rising 1.8 percent last month, keeping up with a steep increase of 9.2 percent in the preceding 12 months.
 Medical care costs also continued to rise, up 0.5 percent for August.

HEADLINE: West Coast Warehouses Add Logistics to Storage as Asia Trade Booms

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN. 
James Flanigan writes about small-business trends in California and the West, and this column appears in print on the third Thursday of every month. E-mail: jamesflanigan@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE huge wave of trade with China and other countries that has washed over the ports here and in Long Beach has been a boon to companies that once regarded themselves simply as small warehouse and distribution businesses.
 Processing and distributing millions of freight-laden containers through the region and out to the rest of the United States have become the largest source of jobs in the region. But the overall growth in the industry is raising new challenges, as state regulators demand reductions in air pollution in the port areas and larger national companies increase the pressure on smaller businesses. 
 Weber Distribution is one company that has grown with the port. It started in 1925 as a warehouse for products made in the East and Midwest and shipped to what was then the remote West Coast. Today, Weber, based in Santa Fe Springs, Calif., has 11 warehouses in three states, 500 employees and more than $120 million in revenue distributing products that come mainly from Asia through the enormous Southern California ports.
 Dan Sanker, a onetime Procter & Gamble executive, formed CaseStack in 1999. Based in Santa Monica, it now relies upon a network of half a dozen warehouses and 1,000 independent trucking firms, linked by the Internet, to transport goods from manufacturers to retailers nationwide. CaseStack has 320 employees and will bring in $74 million in revenue this year, Mr. Sanker said in an interview. 
 And a third company, Source Logistics, has benefited from rising demand in the United States for products from Mexico and Central and South America. Marcelo Sada founded the warehouse company in 1999 to help food companies in Latin America gain access to the rich expanse of supermarkets and specialty stores in the United States. Today, Source Logistics, in addition to its headquarters in Montebello, Calif., has warehouses and distribution centers in Houston and Laredo, Tex., and Atlanta. It has 50 employees, $7 million in annual revenue and serves 80 companies in Latin America.
 These three small to medium-size companies exemplify the logistics industry, a fast-growing business of warehousing, trucking and freight forwarding on the cutting edge of technological and social trends, from Internet commerce to evolving Latino markets. They all benefit from the ports in Southern California, which now handle 44 percent of the nation's merchandise imports, according to the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation. 
 Commerce Department statistics place the value of imports and exports at almost $3 trillion in 2006, up 67 percent since 1999. At $900 billion in annual revenue, logistics now accounts for some four million jobs nationwide and it is the largest single source of employment in Southern California, accounting for more than 650,000 jobs, according to the economist John Husing of Redlands, Calif., an authority on regional industry.
 Companies like Weber Distribution have had to invest in new technology. ''We handled fewer than 200 containers a month in 2000, and today we handle 2,500 containers a month,'' said William H. Butler, Weber's president and chief executive. 
 In 1999, the company invested heavily in computing and communications systems. In its warehouses, forklift operators now use personal digital assistants to keep track of goods stacked on shelves several stories high. The company ''gives clients information about products all the way from factories in China, on ships across the Pacific and through the ports of Los Angeles to final delivery,'' Mr. Butler said. 
 Mr. Sada, from Monterrey, is a member of one of Mexico's most influential business families. He started in the export-import business in the early 1990s using public warehouses in the United States, but said he found the service and information deficient. With three partners, a $100,000 investment and a warehouse management software system, he started Source to help companies like Grupo Bimbo of Mexico City, a large bakery.
 ''I store inventory for them and when they make contact with an American distributor or retailer, I ship their products immediately,'' Mr. Sada said. His company now handles shipments from Central America and Colombia, Brazil, Peru and Argentina. 
 ''My strategy is simple,'' Mr. Sada said. ''I open operations near ports of entry -- San Diego, Los Angeles, Laredo -- and in places of large Latino population.'' A distribution center in Atlanta was built because of growing concentrations of Latin American immigrants in the Southeast, Mr. Sada said, and Source Logistics's next planned distribution center will be in Chicago.
 CaseStack is opening an office in Fayetteville, Ark., to be near the 1,300 companies that have offices in the area to serve the Wal-Mart Stores headquarters in Bentonville. 
 Mr. Sanker said that because so many products are now made overseas and shipped into the United States, ''we must think of ways to reduce costs and fuel consumption.'' Shipping some products, he said, ''is no longer economical when diesel fuel is $3 a gallon.'' 
 CaseStack is working on ways to package goods more efficiently so more products can fit on a single truck, he said, and it is running trucks on biodiesel fuel, which is cheaper in some regions. CaseStack also recently started a Spanish-language Web site to offer logistics help to small businesses owned by Spanish speakers. 
 The logistics business has been growing rapidly but now competitive changes and serious challenges are looming. Large warehouse and trucking companies, like the Saddle Creek Corporation of Lakeland, Fla., and the Kenco Group of Chattanooga, Tenn., are expanding partly by acquiring smaller firms, putting pressure on smaller companies that want to remain independent, said Mr. Butler of Weber Distribution. 
 Global logistics managers, including the C. H. Robinson Company of Eden Prairie, Minn., and Expeditors International of Seattle, are also bringing pressure on smaller firms. 
 The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation's largest port complex, are also being required by state and local regulators to reduce air pollution from their operations or face a halt to needed expansion. The ports have developed a plan that would sharply reduce air pollution over the next five years even as trade expands.
 The plan calls for all trucks coming to take cargo from the ports to be replaced or retrofitted with new engines within five years. That involves a trade-off: Many of the 1,000 small independent trucking companies now serving the port will be put out of business and their operations replaced by larger trucking firms with employees approved by port and federal government officials. The ports will help finance the transition through grants and special loan programs. 
 Mr. Husing, the economist who wrote the official analysis of the anti-pollution program, said expenses will rise. But the reduction of vehicle emissions will allow expansion at the port. That will create ''well over half a million jobs'' in logistics, Mr. Husing estimated in an interview. And logistics, he added, ''is everything from wholesale trade, to truck, rail, air and water transportation, to general warehousing.

HEADLINE: Subsidized Housing Plagued by Neglect and Corruption, Report Says

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The state housing agency's ''deep and systemic failure'' to properly oversee the rapidly dwindling supply of subsidized middle-income housing has led to the deterioration of the buildings, an increase in rents and a waste of taxpayer money, according to a report issued yesterday by the state inspector general, Kristine Hamann.
 The Division of Housing and Community Renewal's mismanagement and lack of oversight at 80,000 apartments in 189 projects built under the state's middle-income Mitchell-Lama housing program also led to unqualified applicants getting subsidized apartments at the expense of legitimate tenants, the report said. 
 At the Towers of Bayridge, an 811-unit complex in Brooklyn, investigators found 59 instances between 2002 and 2004 in which the complex's landlord or agent had improperly put new applicants well ahead of other tenants on a waiting list for apartments.
 At the huge Co-op City complex in the Bronx, investigators discovered that 40 of 47 contracts executed between 2002 and 2006 failed to comply with Mitchell-Lama rules. A former president of the cooperative was charged in April with taking $100,000 in bribes from a painting contractor who was awarded $3.5 million in contracts.
 The inspector general also raised concerns that the state housing agency does not have adequate controls in place to guard against potential abuses or conflicts of interest when employees of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal live in Mitchell-Lama complexes. The report found that 10 of 30 randomly sampled agency employees responsible for supervising Mitchell-Lama complexes in New York also lived in them. One employee was in charge of reviewing applications at a Mitchell-Lama complex in which she lived.
 More important, records showed that agency field staff, who are the primary contacts between the agency and the landlords, had failed to conduct all of the required inspections at more than half of the housing developments in 2005. In addition, half of the inspections conducted during the 2005-6 heating season did not include the required examination of the heating system. 
 ''Our report shows a systemic failure throughout every aspect of D.H.C.R.'s oversight of the Mitchell-Lama program,'' Ms. Hamann said. ''There was a complete abdication of their oversight role.''
 Deborah VanAmerongen, the state housing commissioner, said she has been working with tenant advocates, developers and consultants to implement recommendations by the inspector general and to ''address the need for review and reform throughout'' the Division of Housing and Community Renewal. She also said there is a concerted effort to preserve the remaining Mitchell-Lama housing. 
 The investigation of the state's Mitchell-Lama program covered the period from January 2003 to October 2006, when George E. Pataki was governor. The report comes at a time when advocates for low-, moderate- and middle-income housing, as well as many elected officials in New York City, have warned about the accelerating loss of subsidized apartments to a hot real estate market.
 The Community Service Society, a nonprofit anti-poverty organization, estimated that between 1990 and the end of 2006, more than a quarter of New York City's 119,785 subsidized apartments for low-, moderate- and middle-income families were lost, as owners converted the units to market-rate housing. Mitchell-Lama rental developments, the society said, were the hardest hit, having lost 26,253 units, or 41 percent of the apartments in the program 17 years ago.
 The Mitchell-Lama program was established in 1955 to spur the development of affordable housing. In return for tax breaks and government-sponsored low-interest loans, developers agreed to charge below-market rates for rentals or co-op purchases. After 20 or 25 years, the owners were allowed to buy out of the housing program by paying off the low-interest mortgage. With rents soaring and vacancy rates very low in New York City, many landlords pulled out to take advantage of a rising market. 
 At the highly desirable Westview complex on Roosevelt Island, investigators found a troubling proposal to convert the building to market-rate condominiums. The Division of Housing and Community Renewal granted a proposed buyer a waiver in 2004 to manage the complex. By August 2006, 31 apartments in the complex had been vacant for about a year, despite a waiting list of 1,000 and a policy that ''there should be no vacancies in subsidized housing in New York.''
 It appears that the operator was warehousing the vacant apartments in anticipation of a windfall from their sale as condominiums. Nevertheless, the report said, an agency inspector ''termed the complex's inflated vacancy rate 'satisfactory.' '' The sale fell through in March 2006.
 Amy Chan, the Mitchell-Lama organizer for Tenants & Neighbors, a citywide tenant organization, said she was not surprised by the conclusions of the inspector general's report. ''Tenant leaders and tenants have been voicing concerns about mismanagement and corruption for some time,'' she said. ''They will be happy to see that the report legitimates their experience.''
 She gave Ms. VanAmerongen high marks for trying to deal with the problems she inherited.

HEADLINE: Bank of England Eases Money Policy

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 19 

 BODY:
The Bank of England abruptly reversed its policy on Wednesday of refusing to ease lending standards, offering to inject cash into British money markets amid criticism that it had not done enough to stem a credit squeeze that has undercut its economy. 
 The action came a day after the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions with an aggressive half-point cut in interest rates, a move that buoyed global stock markets but also fanned concern that the United States might still face a notable slowdown.
 Economists have been trimming their international and national growth forecasts as the global credit squeeze, spawned by a meltdown in the market for subprime loans in the United States, curbs lending and saps consumer confidence.
 In Britain, the crisis hit abruptly when Northern Rock, a mortgage lender, ran into difficulties last week that threatened to destabilize the wider British banking system.
 Days earlier, the Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, said the bank would not follow the Fed and the European Central Bank by injecting cash into a system where banks had stopped lending because of volatile conditions, saying such moves encouraged risky behavior by banks.
 The Fed said on Aug. 24 that it would accept asset-backed commercial paper as collateral in exchange for central bank loans, and the E.C.B. has lent billions in cash to banks in seven special auctions since Aug. 9.
 Mr. King was forced to change his stance after the credit squeeze that hobbled Northern Rock showed signs of spreading more widely through the British banking system.
 Political criticism has been mounting that the Bank of England was too slow to react and that earlier reassurances could have soothed panicky customers who lined up for days to withdraw their savings from Northern Rock branches.
 ''It appears he realized that rather than sit there in defiance it's better to actually do something that seems long overdue,'' said Alan Clarke, an economist at BNP Paribas in London.
 Mr. King is scheduled to explain his policies to British lawmakers on Thursday at a hearing in Parliament. The central bank said it would provide funds at a three-month maturity and would accept ''mortgage collateral'' at an auction of $:10 billion ($20 billion) in loans next week to ''alleviate the strains in longer-maturity money markets.'' The bank will still charge a penalty rate of 6.75 percent, it said.
 Some economists said that the latest cash injection might give the Bank of England more room to address the effects of the market turmoil without having to cut interest rates, something Mr. King is trying to avoid.
 The bank has been raising rates as a red-hot housing market showed signs of topping out, and as consumers showed signs of taking on excess debt.
 Still, a number of analysts believe the Bank of England will have to cut rates next year.

HEADLINE: General Says Iran Can Strike Back at Israel

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Sept. 19 

 BODY:
A senior military official warned on Wednesday that Iran had prepared a plan to attack Israel if Israel bombed Iran, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported.
 ''We have drawn up a plan to strike back at Israel with our bombers if this regime possibly makes a silly mistake,'' said the official, Gen. Mohammad Alavi, the deputy commander of Iran's air force. 
 General Alavi spoke in the wake of remarks by the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, who said Sunday that nations should prepare for a possible war with Iran if it continued with its nuclear work. Mr. Kouchner and the French Foreign Ministry subsequently toned down the remarks. 
 International pressure increased on Iran this week. The permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the United States, France, Britain, China and Russia -- plus Germany will meet in Washington on Friday to discuss tougher economic sanctions on Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons. Iran has already been the target of two sets of economic sanctions.
 The United States and some European countries accuse Iran of having a clandestine nuclear arms program. But Iran insists that its program is peaceful.
 A State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said Tuesday that Washington was working on a new draft of sanction resolutions to be discussed at the Friday meeting. 
 General Alavi added in a long interview with Fars that Iran's ''missiles can reach all parts of Israel'' if Iran wanted to retaliate. ''In addition, we can attack them with our fighter bombers in case of an unlikely attack.'' 
 ''We have acquired the capability to confront them,'' he said.
 ''They should know that we will destroy at least 30 percent of their forces before they can leave our country,'' he warned, referring to a possible airstrike against Iran.
 Iranian officials have dismissed threats of war as psychological warfare, but they have vowed to retaliate if they come under attack. 
 In similar comments, Defense Minister Mostafa Najar warned the United States on Wednesday that Iran had different ways to retaliate, Fars reported. 
 ''In response to the U.S. officials who said they have various options to deal with Iran,'' he said, ''I must say that we also have various options to respond to threats.''

HEADLINE: House Approves Plan to Aid Insurers

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 19 

 BODY:
Over the objections of the White House, the House overwhelmingly adopted on Wednesday legislation that would significantly expand the federal program to assist the insurance industry in the event of a major terrorist attack.
 The expansion has been sought by commercial real estate developers and insurers, who say that such insurance is scarce on the private market and that, without it, developers cannot get financing to complete major projects, particularly in cities considered most likely to be attacked.
 By a vote of 312 to 110, the House approved a measure that would extend the terrorism risk insurance program for 15 years. It would add group life insurance to the lines of insurance covered by the program, and it would cover terrorist attacks by Americans as well as by foreigners. It would also require commercial property and casualty insurance policies to cover losses from terrorist attacks involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks. Typically such policies now exclude that coverage. 
 The measure was written by Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, and pushed aggressively by the delegation from New York and surrounding areas. It now heads to the Senate, which is expected to act promptly because the current federal terrorism insurance program is to expire in December.
 In recent days, the prospects for quick legislative action seemed to have been diminished by a new estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that the measure could increase the deficit by $3.5 billion over the next five years and by $8.4 billion over a decade. 
 In one of its first acts after taking control of the House in January, the Democratic majority adopted a ''pay as you go'' measure that required any new government spending to be offset by a tax increase or a cut in other federal programs.
 The new estimate had threatened to derail the measure, and this week the House leadership agreed to wording that even supporters of the legislation said probably would not work but would at least move the legislation along as other options are considered. To get past the ''pay as you go'' rules, the Democrats inserted a provision requiring Congress to vote again if an attack occurred to provide the money outlined in the bill.
 The original Terrorism Risk Insurance Act was adopted in 2002 after commercial real estate developers and other businesses heavily lobbied Congress for assistance to the insurance industry. The industry's unwillingness to provide adequate insurance against terrorism had threatened to derail many projects as lenders insisted on broad coverage. 
 Under that program, which was reauthorized in 2005, the government agrees to provide financial assistance to commercial property and casualty insurers for losses above certain thresholds if those losses are caused by foreign terrorists. The program also gave the government the authority to recoup federal payments up to certain limits.
 This week, the White House said that President Bush would veto the House measure, calling it an unacceptable expansion of what should be a temporary and short-term program. 
 ''The most efficient, lowest-cost and most innovative methods of providing terrorism risk insurance will come from the private sector,'' the White House said in a statement Monday.
 Mr. Frank and others supporting the legislation disagree. ''There are in our midst people who believe in the free market so firmly that they believe in it the way other people believe in unicorns,'' Mr. Frank said.
 He quoted from a 2005 letter to Congress from Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, urging reauthorization of the insurance program because there was no significant coverage available on the private market. Mr. Paulson is now the Treasury secretary.
 Mr. Frank predicted that the part of the bill that bypasses the budget rules would be changed, but Republicans seized on the provision, calling it an accounting gimmick.
 ''This bill should be defeated because it is irresponsible and fiscally dangerous to pass legislation that has an open-ended obligation on the budget,'' said Representative John Culberson, Republican of Texas.
 Some Democrats who support the measure also were uncomfortable with the financing proposal because they said the need for Congress to vote again to approve the disbursement of money would leave too much uncertainty in the markets.
 ''We should fix the rule so that in case there is an attack, the federal government would step in and we would not worry about the budget,'' said Representative Gary L. Ackerman, Democrat of New York. ''Any town, any city, deserves to know that if they are attacked, they will know that America stands behind them and will help put them back together again.''
 Insurance industry groups praised the House vote but said they would lobby against a provision requiring companies to provide coverage for attacks involving weapons of mass destruction.
 ''This provision undermines the intent of the program, reduces consumer choice and would leave more Americans and our economy unnecessarily exposed to the financial devastation from a terrorist attack,'' said Ben McKay, a lobbyist at the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America.

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 19 

 BODY:
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a former finance minister of France, moved a big step forward on Wednesday in his campaign to become managing director of the International Monetary Fund when he won the endorsement of the United States. 
 Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said that Mr. Strauss-Kahn, the nominee of President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, ''will work to make the bold reforms necessary'' at the fund, which provides technical financial advice and on occasion helps rescue countries in balance-of-payments crises.
 Mr. Strauss-Kahn has also won the backing of the European Union. The only other candidate to head the fund is Josef Tosovsky, a former prime minister of the Czech Republic, who has the backing of Russia.

HEADLINE: In Crisis, 2 Fed Chiefs Seem Alike

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 19 

 BODY:
From the moment that Ben S. Bernanke, a former academic, succeeded Alan Greenspan, a longtime Washington insider, as chairman of the Federal Reserve, it seemed clear that he would bring a different style to the august central bank.
 But when the Fed electrified markets on Tuesday with a big cut in its benchmark interest rate, Mr. Bernanke confirmed what many experts had noticed for some time: in practice, Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Greenspan are remarkably similar.
 ''Both of them,'' said Martin Feldstein, a professor of economics at Harvard and a onetime contender for Fed chairman, ''have acted in a way that involved a balancing of risks -- the risk of higher inflation versus the risk of unemployment -- that I think is appropriate.'' 
 Yet even as they approach the job in similar ways, the real change, according to analysts and former Fed officials, is the difference in the underlying economic challenges that confront the new chairman.
 During his last decade at the bank, Mr. Greenspan presided over a period of declining inflation and rapid growth in productivity. By contrast, Mr. Bernanke took over at a time when inflation was edging up and productivity growth was slowing.
 ''Once we get through this crisis, the Bernanke Fed is going to have to confront the reverse of what the Greenspan Fed had to face,'' said Adam Posen, deputy director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and an author with Mr. Bernanke of a book on monetary policy.
 ''Where Greenspan had to hold off raising rates when the economy was strong,'' Mr. Posen continued, ''Bernanke's challenge will be to hold off cutting rates when the economy slows down.''
 That poses a potential problem for Mr. Bernanke: doing what Alan Greenspan did -- keeping rates lower than conventional wisdom suggested at the time -- could prove to be the wrong recipe.
 ''It does appear that most of the productivity bonus in the Fed's effort to contain inflation is not going to be there now,'' said J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. 
 If the growth in productivity -- the amount of output for each hour of work -- remains sluggish and core inflation remains above the Fed's unofficial target of 2 percent, Mr. Bernanke could find it more difficult to cut rates aggressively in a crisis. That is because slower productivity increases the risk that higher wages will fuel inflation.
 In that kind of situation, with fewer safety valves, Mr. Bernanke could find himself under even greater pressure from both political leaders and Wall Street.
 Indeed, the pressure is already there. On Tuesday, Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, criticized the Fed simply for warning that inflation risks had not disappeared. Mr. Frank said he was concerned that the Fed was focusing too much on fighting inflation instead of protecting jobs. 
 On Thursday, Mr. Frank will lead a hearing on the housing crisis at which Mr. Bernanke will testify alongside Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary.
 Many analysts on Wall Street had expected Mr. Bernanke to be cautious in responding to the panic in financial markets. Mr. Greenspan cut interest rates after the stock market crash of October 1987, the Russian financial crisis of 1998 and the collapse of many technology stocks in 2000.
 In part because of his deft touch and the sense that he kept the economy out of trouble, Mr. Greenspan became something of an icon.
 He overshadowed every other policy maker at the Fed, and was treated by some as an oracle on economic issues, to a point outside his purview of monetary policy. He opposed any constraints on the Fed's ''discretion'' in responding to economic surprises. 
 Mr. Bernanke, by comparison something of an unknown, arrived with the goal of ''depersonalizing'' Fed policy. He was not big on Washington socializing, or on the idea of a domineering Fed chairman. In sharp contrast, he argued that monetary policy should be guided less by discretion and more by a fixed target for inflation.
 Yet Mr. Greenspan was not always as bold as his legend. When the Russians plunged into financial crisis in August 1998, causing a credit squeeze similar in many respects to the one today, Mr. Greenspan was initially reluctant to cut interest rates.
 When the central bank did act in September, it lowered overnight rates by only one-quarter of a percent and investors became even more nervous. It was only in October, two months after the Russian crisis began, that the Fed cut rates more boldly -- by an additional one-half percent. 
 Mr. Bernanke followed a similar pattern during the last month. Despite growing fear in financial markets about mortgage defaults, the Fed refused to change course at its policy meeting on Aug. 7. Ten days later, as the commercial-paper market seized up, the Fed took a partial step by reducing the rate at which banks could take out short-term loans through its ''discount window.''
 In recent weeks, Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials emphasized that their goal was less about calming Wall Street and more about protecting the ''real'' economy.
 But that turned out to be a distinction without a difference. 
 ''The Fed's responsibility is to make sure that the real economy is moving toward its statutory goal of price stability and full employment,'' said Michael H. Moskow, who retired in August as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. ''A freezing up of financial markets can have a significant effect on the real economy.''
 In the end, Mr. Moskow added, it was only natural for Mr. Bernanke to respond in much the same way as Mr. Greenspan. ''Fed watchers overemphasize the personalities,'' he said. ''They are both going to do essentially the same thing in a situation like this.''

HEADLINE: The French Revolution

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
PARIS
 The French Revolution of 2007 has not seen heads roll but has involved the destruction of 10 taboos as President Nicolas Sarkozy assumes the role of Europe's most dynamic leader.
 THE AMERICAN TABOO Enthusiasm for the United States was unacceptable for a French political leader because it was always interpreted as an embrace of ''Wild West'' capitalism, ''Anglo-Saxon'' hegemony and vulgarity. De rigueur attitudes held sway: patronizing contempt in Paris met macho derision in Washington. Communication suffered. Sarko's New Hampshire vacation, enthused American dreaming, iPod-accompanied jogging and in-your-face style cleared the air.
 THE AGRICULTURAL TABOO No French president could seem uncomfortable patting the backside of a cow. This gesture, at the annual Paris Agricultural Fair, communicated a leader's link to the land and to deepest France. But the only cows known to Sarko, city dweller par excellence, are on cheese packages. The vache political credential is dead; French urban politicos no longer feel cowed. 
 THE MONEY TABOO ''To live happy, live hidden'' goes a French saying. Few things were more hidden than contacts between presidents and the rich. Francois Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac had well-heeled friends, but, knowing that the French tend to think that wealth equals theft, or something close, they kept those ties quiet. Sarkozy, with his Rolexes and penchant for the yachts of millionaire friends, has broadcast that money's O.K.
 THE CULTURAL TABOO To run France, you had to be cultured. Mitterrand's bookish references and Delphic utterances (''A president must know how to be bored'') positioned him as too clever to contest. Chirac had a recherche passion for Japan. Culture -- like cows but on a different level -- connected the president to the Gallic eternal. Sarko, an American movie buff, is more at home with Johnny Hallyday than Jean-Paul Sartre.
 THE MIDEAST TABOO Strong French ties and traditions in the Middle East dictated coolness toward Israel. Chirac let slip that an Iranian nuclear bomb might be acceptable, before saying he'd misspoken. Now Sarkozy, forthright in his support of Israel, declares that ''an Iranian bomb or the bombing of Iran'' may be the terrible choice looming; his foreign minister says the world should ''prepare for the worst'' in Iran, meaning war. Iran is no Arab country, but these utterances betray a changed politique Arabe.
 THE RUSSIAN TABOO Moscow was France's offsetting power to the United States. For many cold-war years, the French left struggled to decide what was worse: Soviet totalitarianism or American imperialism. Some of the French right was undecided, too. Later, Chirac suggested ''neo-liberalism'' -- unfettered market forces -- was as much a danger in the 21st century as totalitarianism in the 20th. Weak-kneed moral equivalency often placed Paris in a halfway house between Washington and Moscow. Sarkozy is clear: American democracy beats Russian authoritarianism, just as U.S. freedom beat Soviet enslavement. 
 THE WORK TABOO Working hard to get rich was un-Gallic. Working less -- a 35-hour week -- to feel happy (in theory) was French. Sarkozy now praises those who ''get up early.'' In the land of ''I think, therefore I am,'' his finance minister declares: ''Enough of thought! Let's roll up our sleeves.'' Sarkoland's slogan: ''I work, therefore I am.''
 THE FAR-RIGHT TABOO For decades, Jean-Marie Le Pen's xenophobic National Front prospered on an untouchable flank. Sarkozy has undermined this bigoted party with some bigotry of his own about French national identity and a campaign to deport illegal immigrants. At the same time, he's been franker than the left about France's problem with immigrants and named Rachida Dati, the daughter of a Moroccan laborer and Algerian cleaning lady, as justice minister.
 THE NATO TABOO There's talk of France rejoining the integrated military command of the alliance, unthinkable since Charles de Gaulle hauled the country out in a huff in 1966.
 THE IVY LEAGUE TABOO The passport to government office was always attendance at the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, where future ministers acquired the mind-numbing skill of saying they had seven points to make and remembering all seven without notes. Sarko loathes such Ivy League clubbiness. He prefers an egghead-lite government.
 The bulk of this taboo-smashing is positive because it has stripped away paralyzing French hypocrisy, opened the way for unfettered French-American discussion and cleared a possible path to tackling chronic high unemployment.
 The calculated use of anti-immigrant rhetoric is troubling, and I'm worried by the loose talk on Iran. But I'll go on embracing Sarkozy while waiting to see if he's a revolutionary in action as well as in words.

HEADLINE: Taxing the Hand That Feeds Us

BYLINE: By RAMESH PONNURU. 
Ramesh Ponnuru is a senior editor at National Review.

 BODY:
Washington
 REPUBLICAN presidential candidates can't get elected without owning the tax issue. So far, the current crop is giving it away. 
 A huge reason for Ronald Reagan's popularity was his cutting of all income-tax rates and ending of ''bracket creep,'' in which inflation pushed earners into higher tax groups. Congressional Republicans promised a tax credit for children while sweeping the 1994 elections. In 2000, George W. Bush promised to expand that tax credit and to reduce income taxes.
 Yes, the top Republican contenders for 2008 are promising to keep all of Mr. Bush's tax cuts. But the Democrats are not threatening the child tax credit or Mr. Bush's reductions in the lower-level income-tax rates. Those issues are off the table. 
 What Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani -- who have made the most detailed remarks on taxes of the top-tier candidates -- are really saying is that they will make sure that taxes on capital gains, dividends, estates and high earners will stay low. Not many middle-class taxpayers will benefit directly from any of those policies.
 Mr. Romney adds that he will try to cut the corporate tax rate, which his adviser Glenn Hubbard calls ''a drain on competitiveness.'' Many of our trading partners have cut their corporate taxes, and more and more conservatives want the United States to follow suit. Apparently they haven't been listening to their own speeches on free trade. Companies compete. Countries, however, are not engaged in a zero-sum contest where one nation's gain is another's loss. Cutting corporate tax rates may or may not be a good idea, but we don't need to make it a priority to preserve our competitiveness.
 Both Mr. Romney and Mr. Giuliani speak vaguely about making sure the alternative minimum tax doesn't affect any more middle-class families. That is a step in the right direction. But it isn't a tax cut. 
 Mr. Romney has also proposed an initiative to make the return on middle-class savings tax-free. It may also be a step in the right direction, but it's small change. The primary focus of the Romney and Giuliani tax plans remains high earners.
 What would be a serious middle-class tax cut? One answer is to expand the tax credit for children. But none of the candidates is proposing to do so, or any other big tax relief for regular folks. You might think that Mr. Giuliani would want to do everything he can to appeal to social conservatives short of actually becoming one himself. But why should he offer a pro-family tax cut when even the hard-core social conservatives in the race aren't interested? Mike Huckabee wants a national sales tax and Sam Brownback wants a flat tax. Either proposal would increase taxes on a lot of middle-class families. 
 The Republicans in Congress are no better. For much of the right, the great passion of the moment is to make sure that the carried interest at hedge funds is taxed at what look an awful lot like preferential rates. For years, liberals have said that Republicans talk about ''family values'' but won't do anything to meet the economic needs of families. Right now, on taxes, that charge hits home.
 Two ideological misconceptions underlie the party's lack of imagination. First, Republicans worry that taking people off the income-tax rolls, as an expanded child credit would do, would make voters think big government is free and turn to the Democrats. But there's no real evidence for this. Besides, parents are likely to be future-oriented voters, and they will realize that they will be paying higher taxes again once their children have grown up.
 Second, Republicans believe, in general, that the tax code should generate its revenue in a way that does the least damage possible to the economy. So they seek tax reforms that cut taxes on investment returns and thereby increase economic growth. What they ignore is that we overtax investments in children, too. Parents make financial sacrifices to produce the next generation of taxpayers, who will pay for everyone's retirements. Yet the tax code does too little to recognize parents' investments.
 True, an expanded tax credit for children wouldn't increase economic growth. Growth is good, and more growth is better. But present tax rates are perfectly compatible with healthy long-term growth. There is no pressing need to bring them down to improve growth.
 A few conservative strategists have designed tax reform plans that modestly cut corporate tax rates and simplify the tax code while also helping families. (One idea is to make up the lost revenue by bumping affluent childless people into higher tax brackets.) So far, the candidates have not been interested. 
 As the Republican Party has gotten more socially conservative, its voter base has become lower in income. Many of the working-class social conservatives on whom the party relies are parents trying to make ends meet, or young people who want to start families but have financial worries. They have no particular attachment, or hostility, to free-market principles. A Republican Party that found a conservative way to meet their economic needs would both hold and expand its base.

HEADLINE: Rate Cut Lifts Shares for a Second Day

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks extended their biggest rally in four years, buoyed by speculation that Federal Reserve interest rate cuts will help contain the housing slump and lead to profit growth.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 9.25 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,529.03. The Dow average increased 76.17 points, or 0.6 percent, to 13,815.56. The Nasdaq composite index added 14.82 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,666.48. The Russell 2000 index, a benchmark for companies with a median market value of $644 million, climbed 1.3 percent, to 817.40. 
 Some 1.7 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
 All 10 S.& P. 500 industry groups gained for a second day after the Fed reduced its benchmark lending rate by half a percentage point and pledged to act as needed to keep the economy from slowing.
 ''This is a shot of adrenaline,'' said Scott Black, who manages $1.8 billion as president of Delphi Management in Boston. ''With foreclosures going up and the bad tailspin in the housing market, it was going to pinch the consumer as we head toward the Thanksgiving and Christmas season.''
 Ten-year Treasury notes fell for a third day as investors speculated rate cuts would aggravate inflation. Their yield rose 0.07 percentage point, to 4.54 percent. The price fell 18/32, to 101 20/32. Yields move inversely to prices.
 AT&T climbed 75 cents, to $41.58. The company, which has exclusive United States rights to sell iPhone service, said at a conference in New York that iPhone sales had increased since Apple cut the price by a third. Apple slipped 15 cents, to $140.77.
 Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold rallied $2.20, to a record $105.50. Copper rose to a six-week high on speculation that the Fed's rate cut would increase demand for metals.
 Financial shares in the S.& P. 500 climbed 0.6 percent as a group and contributed the most to the benchmark's gain.
 The regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced it would allow the government-chartered companies to increase their home-loan portfolios, a move intended to improve the market for mortgage securities.
 Fannie Mae rose $1.44, to $63.98. Freddie Mac climbed $1.64, to $61.16.
 Accredited Home Lenders Holding, the subprime mortgage lender, gained $1.78, to $11.56. The company ended a two-month dispute with its buyout suitor, Lone Star Funds, by agreeing to a lower bid.
 Morgan Stanley slipped $1.48, to $67.03. Losses on loans for leveraged buyouts and a decline in fixed-income trading revenue caused third-quarter profit from continuing operations to decline to $1.38 a share, from $1.50 a year earlier, the company said.
 Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns are scheduled to report earnings today before exchanges open in the United States.
 A gauge of energy producers in the S.& P. 500 rose 0.8 percent. Crude for October delivery rose 42 cents, or 0.5 percent, to settle at $81.93 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures touched $82.51, the highest intraday price since trading began in 1983.
 Schlumberger, the largest oil-field services provider, led the industry group with a gain of $2.13, to $106.92.

HEADLINE: Euro Reaches All-Time High Against Dollar

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY; Ian Austen contributed reporting from Ottawa.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Sept. 20 

 BODY:
Investors around the world dumped the dollar today, pushing it to an all-time low of $1.40 against the euro and to parity with the Canadian dollar for the first time in three decades as currency traders digested the full implications of the Federal Reserve's new course for interest rates. 
 The frenzied selling began early in the day in Europe, never let up, and reached across the Atlantic as traders concluded that the lower borrowing costs the Fed introduced on Tuesday would dampen the appeal of dollar-denominated assets like stocks, bonds and real estate just as other central banks are raising rates to create the opposite effect.
With the Fed's action layered atop a weakening American economy that is menaced as well by the prospect of a retreat by consumers who have driven growth for years, the dollar radiated instability. Its traditional role as a refuge in times of crisis, evident as recently as early August, appeared all but forgotten. 
 ''It's pretty ugly right now for the dollar,'' said Jim McCormick, the London-based chief of currency strategy for Lehman Brothers International. ''But the markets are having a very rational response to what the Fed did on Tuesday.''
 The dollar dipped as low as $1.4094 in midday trading in New York, having cracked the $1.40 level in London, the world's currency trading hub. The dollar also lost ground against the pound, with sterling now worth roughly $2.
 The Japanese yen and the Swiss franc also rallied strongly against the dollar, a highly unusual development since interest rates are still comparatively low in both those countries. The yen registered its biggest daily drop against the Japanese yen in two weeks.
 Against the Canadian dollar, currency of the largest United States trading partner, the dollar tumbled to one-to-one, a level not seen since the 1976, the early phase of a currency crisis that would eventually send shock waves through the world economy.
 ''It seems light years from five years ago when the dollar was threatening to drop below 60 cents,'' said Douglas Porter, an economist with BMO Nesbitt Burns, the brokerage unit of the Bank of Montreal. ''It will affect the psychology here in a big way.''
 Gold prices also soared, reaching a 27-year high at $746.50 an ounce in New York trading before closing at $739.90, up $10.40. 
 Still, currency analysts are dodging the label ''dollar crisis'' for the moment, preferring to see today's events as the logical outcome of the Fed's surprise decision to lower its benchmark rate by a half percentage point, to 4.75 percent -- a step intended to quarantine the wider economy from the effects of a housing market collapse and soothe jittery credit markets.
 But there is little doubt that attitudes toward the dollar are evolving faster that most analysts had expected.
 ''What is changing here is that people have been living with this notion that the dollar might get weaker briefly and then recover,'' said Thomas Stolper, a currency strategist with Goldman Sachs in New York. ''But that view is evolving.'' 
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, acknowledged the gravity of the crisis during an appearance before a House committee today, while rationalizing the rate cut as part of the careful balance the central bank has to strike between combating inflation and promoting growth.
 Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., at the same event, said the Bush administration was considering allowing the federally-backed mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy and securitize ''jumbo'' loans of over $417,000. In theory, the step would help relax stretched mortgage markets.
 President Bush also chimed in with soothing words, even as the world ever-more heatedly debates whether the U.S. economy will fall into recession. ''The fundamentals of our nation's economy are strong,'' Mr. Bush said at a news conference. ''There is no question that there is some unsettling times in the housing market.''
 But almost daily, the American economy seems to be providing fresh evidence that the real estate slump might jar consumers into spending less -- a fear evidently shared by policy makers at the Fed. That has given a fresh impetus to traders bearish on the dollar.
 ''I'm not sure you can argue that it is just interest rate differentials driving the dollar's weakness,'' said Mitul Kotecha, global head of foreign exchange research at Calyon in London. ''The Fed is validating this course, but underlying that is concerns about economic growth.''
 In Europe, the dollar's record-breaking tumble set off a political reaction that has become common in recent years, with the French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, calling for a continent-wide effort to reverse its course.
 ''Let's say that it's a change in level that concerns all of us Europeans, and it's clearly a point we must address together among Europeans,'' Ms. Lagarde said during a trip to China, Reuters reported.
 French worries about the rise of the euro, the unified currency established in 1999, have gone largely unheeded in other European capitals. Ms. Lagarde's German counterpart, Peer Steinbruck, even went so far as to say, ''I love a strong euro.'' Yet even in Germany, the export dynamo of Europe, some spotty evidence is starting to accumulate that the currency's strength is chipping away at sales by making shipments abroad more expensive.
 Ralf Wiechers, chief economist for VDMA, the association representing the machine tool makers whose performance has been the backbone of the German boom, said that market share was holding up thanks to stiff worldwide growth. But currency values are starting to influence how much money they are making.
 ''The world economy is creating the volume,'' Mr. Wiechers said. ''The exchange rate is starting to decide what the profit margin is.'' As an example, he cited makers of printing presses, who face tough competition from American and Japanese companies that now enjoy a considerable exchange-rate advantage over the Germans.
 Yet at its broadest level, the strong euro offers some advantages to Europe. Most notable is the ability to acquire raw materials, above all oil, with a muscular currency.
 Oil prices set another record on Thursday, reaching $82.55 in New York. In theory Europeans are insulated by the spike through the euro, but that effect is bound to distribute itself in various ways, economists said.
 For example, big importers and refiners of crude can expect a shot in the arm, maybe even enabling them to hire more people. But manufacturing employees who get laid off because sales ebb on the back of a strong euro cannot simply go into the energy business.
 ''In a textbook case, what you would in effect see is big shifts of economic resources,'' said Erik Nielsen, chief Europe economist at Goldman Sachs. ''But this is an economy in which some win and some lose.''
 In Canada, meanwhile, economists generally agree that the Canadian dollar's ascent, which picked up speed about two years ago, is mostly related to the Canadian economy's health rather than shortcomings in the United States' economy. 
 Demand, much of it from Asia, has bolstered prices for several majorCanadian exports including minerals, oil and wheat. At the same time the Canadian government, which restructured its operations and finances during the 1990s, is on track to report its 11th consecutive budget surplus.
 As the chief economist of the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, a lobby group, Jayson Myers, finds little professional joy in the Canadian dollar's ascent. But he readily acknowledged that achieving parity would bolster Canadians' spirits.
 ''It makes a lot of people feel pretty good,'' said Mr. Myers, who is based in Ottawa. ''They can go on trips to the States again, they can go on trips to Europe. After 16 years of always seeing their currency in an inferior position, Canadians now have strong buying power.''
 But that, in the end, may also mean that some of the biggest gains from a strong Canadian dollar will ultimately accrue outside of Canada, particularly to the United States travel and retail industries.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Calls for New Mortgage Rules

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said today that the growing turmoil from increasingly permissive subprime lending had demonstrated a need for tougher restrictions on what borrowers and lenders can do.
 In testimony this morning to the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Bernanke said a full review of consumer protection regulations was under way under existing regulatory authority.
''The recent problems in subprime lending have underscored the need not only for better disclosure and new rules but also for more-uniform enforcement in the fragmented market structure of brokers and lenders,'' he said. 
 Today's hearing is focusing on subprime lending practices and ways to mitigate foreclosures. Among those testifying is the secretary of housing and urban development, Alphonso Jackson, who estimated that of the 2 million subprime home loans whose interest rates are scheduled to reset by the end of next year, perhaps 500,000 would go into foreclosure.
 Some analysts have said that a majority of those loans may go into foreclosure, with borrowers unable to switch to a new variable-rate loan that provides relief. Such switching, previously routine, has become difficult as the mortgage lending market has tightened.
 Mr. Bernanke said that 15 percent of subprime loans were seriously delinquent in July -- that is, 90 days or more in arrears -- triple the level of two years ago. 
 Mr. Bernanke's call for consideration of stricter regulation of mortgage lending practices signals a shift from the policy of the Fed and other federal regulatory institutions over the last several years. The regulators were reluctant to block mortgage products that might have a useful purpose for certain kinds of people, and did not want to interfere with the markets.
 Now, the Fed chairman said, ''improved and more timely disclosures may not be sufficient in some cases'' for protecting consumers. ''We are looking closely at some mortgage lending practices, including prepayment penalties, escrow accounts for taxes and insurance, stated-income and low-documentation lending and the evaluation of a borrower's ability to repay.''
 Prepayment penalities, which can make it difficult for borrowers to escape a loan that exceeds their means, are probably the most controversial practice in subprime borrowing mortgage area. Escrow accounts for taxes and insurances are meant to prevent a homeowner from being caught with a big bill at the end of the year for accumulated property taxes and insurance. And ''stated-income and low-documentation lending'' refers to loans that take little or no account of the borrower's ability to repay.
 Also testifying this morning was Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., who signaled some softening of the administration's opposition to raising the limits on mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two big finance companies known as government-sponsored enterprises, or G.S.E.'s. 
 The two companies are currently limited to loans of $417,000 or less, and therefore barred from so-called ''jumbo'' mortgages. ''There is little question that allowing the G.S.E.'s to securitize jumbo mortgages would give a short-term lift,'' Mr. Paulson said in his testimony today. But he said that ''consideration of this issue should be limited to a provision that is temporary.''
 The companies are currently limited to about $700 billion each in the mortgages that they back. Mr. Paulson said it would be ''fiscally irresponsible'' to expand those limits substantially unless Fannie and Freddie got a much strengthened regulator in place of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. 
 Even though there is no statutory federal guarantee for the mortgages backed by the two entities, he said taxpayers would be implicitly on the hook for any defaults.
 ''The current G.S.E. regulator has less authority than a federal bank regulator,'' Mr. Paulson said.
 The regulator, known as Ofheo, said Wednesday that it was allowing Fannie and Freddie to expand their portfolios by about 2 percent a year, a move that analysts said would do little to ease the strain on the housing market.
 Mr. Paulson praised House passage of a bill aimed at reforming the regulatory structure of the two companies. But Senate Democrats see little prospect of passage of a comparable Senate bill in the next two months.

Copies of the article "Languages Die, but Not Their Last Words," found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070920thursday.html (one per student)
Activities / Procedures:
1. Warm-Up/Do-Now: Before class, copy the following list of words and meanings as a handout (one per student) and distribute to students as they enter the room. Have a world map on display to use for identifying regions. Note that the words below can be found on the Global Language Hotspots Web site at http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/langhotspots/index.html under each region's trivia. 
Phrases From Endangered Languages (Regions Identified in Parentheses)

Di'nisbaas means "I'm in the process of driving a vehicle into something and getting stuck" in Navajo (Oklahoma/Southwest)
        
Nempeyveescamoo means "to do something correctly" in Lengua (Paraguay)
        
In Gana, the words for plants and animals are split into three categories: edible "eat-things" (kx'ooxo), harmful "bite-things" (paaxo), and "useless things" (gowahaxo) (Botswana) 
        
Barrkmulbardme means "hopping male Black Wallaroo" in Kune (Australia) 
        
Minh-pirri means "a deceased cousin's sibling on one's mother's side" in Yir-Yoront (Australia)

There are three verbs for "to go" in Lolovoli because of the steep hills of the island where it is spoken: "go up" (hage), "go across" (vano) and "go down" (hivo) (Vanuatu) 
        
Artyshtaar means "to burn juniper as incense for religious purposes" in Tuvan (Siberia)
        
Chary means "a 5-year-old, castrated, domesticated reindeer that can be ridden" in Tofa (Siberia) 
        
Aimerpok means "to visit and expect food" in Aleut (North America/Russia) 
Ask volunteers to try to pronounce each word and read aloud its meaning. Then ask them to offer their opinions on the following questions: "What facts are relayed by the use of each word? Why might the specific descriptions relayed by the word be significant? Why might it be important for people in this culture to be able to use one word to express this thought, idea or feeling?" 
Explain to students that the words are from endangered languages, or languages that are spoken by very few people and are therefore at risk of disappearing from the culture. 
2. As a class, read and discuss the article "Languages Die, but Not Their Last Words" (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070920thursday.html), focusing on the following questions:
a. What is the goal of the study supported by the National Geographic Society and the Living Tongues Institute?
b. What factors might lead to the extinction of a language?
c. Why might the loss be most acute in the five highlighted regions?
d. What information or ideas might be lost when the languages become extinct?
e. What is the researcher's process for conserving the languages or elements of the languages?
f. What do you think are the defining characteristics of a language that is primarily spoken but not written; one that is written but not spoken; one that is both spoken and written?
g. What role do you think language plays in relating the history and significance of a culture to its own people?
h. What role do you think it plays in relating that information to the larger culture or society? 
3. Explain to students that they will duplicate the process followed by the researchers featured in the article by investigating the unique words and phrases of their own generation. To begin, arrange the class into small groups and provide each group with a tape recorder and a topic (chosen from the list below, if desired).
Topics

        
Sports
        
Movies
        
Music
        
School
        
Food
        
Fashion
        
Games
Step 1: Gather Recorded Speech
 Tell students they have five minutes to discuss the topic. They must record their entire conversation. Explain that they may change topics as they go. It's more important to capture their speech than to stick to their topic. 
Step 2: Develop a Grammar Guide
 Have students exchange their recorded conversations with other groups. Each group will listen to the conversation and note the words and phrases they feel are unique to their generation, region or culture, with those words or phrases that sound connected to another region, culture or generation to be listed separately. They then create a glossary with definitions for each word or phrase. 
Step 3: Prepare an Adult Reader
 Using the words and phrases on their lists, groups will write translation guides for adults in which they put down a sentence that they might speak, and a translated sentence that uses the language of their parents' generation. 
Have each group share one or two highlights from their Adult Reader with the class. What distinguishes their parents' language from that of their generation? What, if any, nuances do they observe in the words and phrases of each generation? 
4. Wrap-Up/Homework: Individually, students will take a Shakespearean sonnet and translate it into a modern piece. Which words or phrases in Shakespeare's Elizabethan English have become obsolete or scarce in contemporary literature? How might cultural nuances be offered by those words or phrases? For any of the words you replaced, is there a single word that offers the same meaning, or the same nuance of meaning? What do you think is lost or gained in your translation? Write a short analysis that addresses these questions. Have students share and discuss their work in the next class. 
Further Questions for Discussion:

        
To what degree do you experiment with using new (or old) words in your oral or written language?
        
How might the changes in language from one generation to the next affect the ways in which people are able to communicate their beliefs, feelings and ideas?
        
Do you think it is important or necessary to save languages from becoming extinct? Why or why not?
Evaluation / Assessment: Students will be evaluated based on participation in the opening exercise, thoughtful participation in group work, and completion of updated sonnets.
Vocabulary: linguists, indigenous, accumulated, dialects, dominance, moribund.
Extension Activities:
1. Create a color-coded map of the world identifying languages thematically, for example, by their roots (Greek, Arabic, Latin or Germanic), number of speakers or extent of dispersal around the globe. 
2. Prepare a demonstration of a form of sign language, like American Sign Language, Fingerspelling, Contact Sign, Baby Sign, Baseball Sign or Gestuno with a handout that identifies the meanings of the various signs. 
3. Using the information found on the Enduring Voice Web site at nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices, summarize the findings on a dying language in one region. 
4. Read a work of letters written before the 20th century, like the Bible, Beowulf, a Shakespearean play, a novel by Jane Austen or the Gettysburg Address. Identify words or phrases in the text that would be considered obscure in contemporary English and create a glossary with their definitions and contemporary translations. 
5. Consult an online dictionary, like Merriam-Webster or the Oxford English Dictionary, to learn what new words have been added since students' birth years. Create a poster of 10 to 20 words of the most interesting words, with their definitions and associated illustrations. 
6. Invent a language and create a story based on it, like in Harry Potter, "Star Trek" or "A Clockwork Orange." What is the basis or root of the new language? Create a glossary for readers.
Interdisciplinary Connections
American History: Prepare a color-coded map of American Indian languages and identify words used in contemporary English, like hominy, moccasin and powwow. Create a glossary of words that identifies its language of origin (like Hopi, Algonquin or Narragansett) and notes whether the language is living or endangered. Submit finished work to the school library as a reference. 
Media Studies: Watch a film featuring an American Indian character or theme, like "Windtalkers" (2002), "Skins" (2002), "The Business of Fancydancing" (2002), or "Smoke Signals" (1998). Write an analysis paper that assesses the portrayal of the central conflict, main characters and cultural context. 
Science: Prepare a "How It Works" poster on the biological and physical components of speech, like the functions of the larynx, tongue, cerebellum, eyes, ears and hands. 
Teaching With The Times: Read The Times every day for three weeks and select one word each day that you need to look up in the dictionary. Record each word and its definition in your journal. At the end of three weeks, create a poem, story or a crossword puzzle using all of the words you selected. To order The New York Times for your classroom, click here.

HEADLINE: Germany's Commercial Ties With Iran Prove Hard to Cut

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: DARMSTADT, Germany, Sept. 18 

 BODY:
As European leaders argue about whether to tighten sanctions against Iran, the debate is not just diplomatic. Here in this industrial city, German exporters gathered Tuesday to learn about ''market opportunities'' in Iran that they complain are drying up.
 Germany has long been one of Tehran's largest trading partners, but its exports to Iran plunged nearly 18 percent in the first half of this year. Business people at the chamber of commerce here blamed the legal uncertainties of doing business in Iran for the trend. 
 Still, Rolf Weitowitz, a representative of the German Office for Foreign Trade, told the group that Iran was eager to buy all sorts of capital goods that German companies specialize in making: turbines for power plants, water-treatment systems, monorails, even windmill farms.
 Iran, he said, would offer ''promising potential for German suppliers and partners,'' if only the political atmosphere had not been soured by the dispute over Iran's nuclear ambitions, the United Nations sanctions over the same issue, and the anti-Israel comments of Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
 To some critics, the fact that this meeting was held illustrates why Germany is not taking as hard a line as the United States or France toward Iran. German companies, they say, are determined to preserve their ties to a country that has been one of their most durable trading partners.
 ''Germans either can't, or won't, see the kinds of people with whom they are doing business,'' said Nasrin Amirsedghi, an Iranian writer and critic of the Tehran government, who distributed leaflets outside the meeting. ''How can this country, with its history, ignore such things?''
 Chancellor Angela Merkel has condemned Mr. Ahmadinejad, saying in a speech in February 2006, ''A president who questions Israel's right to exist, a president who denies the Holocaust, cannot expect to receive any tolerance from Germany. We have learned our history.''
 Largely under pressure from the Bush administration, Germany's three major commercial banks agreed over the summer to wind down their business in Iran, an important step in isolating the country, experts say, by making it harder for its government to obtain financing.
 Germany's Economics Ministry has also scaled back the export credit guarantees it issues for trade with Iran, to $1.2 billion last year from $3.3 billion in 2004. But German companies still exported $5.7 billion worth of goods to Iran in 2006, up from $5 billion in 2004.
 Privately, American and Israeli officials express frustration that Germany has been more resistant than Britain or France to reducing commercial ties with Iran. With Germany's hold on the Iranian market so unsettled, experts say China has overtaken it as the largest trade partner.
 At least 1,700 German companies are active in Iran, including household names like Siemens and BASF. Many of these connections go back decades, though few companies like to advertise that nowadays. Siemens, for example, supplies locomotives and gas turbines to Iran.
 ''We're not giving out much information, primarily because of security issues,'' said a spokesman for Siemens, Wolfram Trost.
 France also has deep commercial ties with Iran through companies that include Renault and Total, and the sharper tone of President Nicolas Sarkozy toward Tehran has put them in an awkward position.
 For the German machinery makers and other exporters at the meeting here, most of them family-owned businesses, the deteriorating atmosphere is a source of deep frustration. Those already in Iran worry that Chinese exporters are waiting in the wings to pluck their customers.
 ''If the Germans stop exporting, if the French stop exporting, the Chinese will do it. Period,'' said Albert Sax, the managing director of Labcon, a small company that supplies laboratory equipment to Iran. ''This entire system of embargoes and sanctions will be meaningless.''
 His colleagues nodded glumly, their mood having already darkened upon hearing a lecture on the legal risks they face dealing with the country. For companies with ties to the United States, those risks are particularly acute because of its strict embargo, said Harald Hohmann, a lawyer who specializes in trade.
 Asked what a German exporter to Iran should do if it has American employees, Mr. Hohmann replied, ''Remove all the Americans from the company.'' Later, he clarified, ''I'm not against America; I just want companies to understand the risks of doing business in Iran.''
 Deutsche Bank cited the red tape and administrative costs of being in Iran as the main reason it is closing its business. But Deutsche Bank, as well as Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank, were prodded by the Treasury Department in Washington, which sent the under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, Stuart Levey, to Germany in July to lobby the banks.
 A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department declined to comment on Germany's commercial ties with Iran.
 With tensions rising, Germany seems sensitive to accusations that it is fostering a business-as-usual atmosphere. Chancellor Merkel spoke out against bidding by German companies for a contract to build a magnetic elevated rail system in Iran. The Economics Ministry asked the chamber of commerce in Darmstadt to remove the ministry's name from a brochure and Web site advertising the meeting about marketing to Iran.
 The chamber's deputy director, Axel Scheer, said the federal and state authorities would have preferred that he had canceled the meeting. Rubbing his eyes in frustration, he said he did not intend for the meeting, scheduled a year ago, to be viewed as promoting Iran.
 ''It's our obligation to explain to German companies the risks of doing business there,'' he said. ''We're not trying to support weapons sales to Iran. This is not a political organization.''

HEADLINE: Entrepreneurs Defend a Tax Benefit Despite a Dubious Congress

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
CHICKEN stuffed with mashed potatoes, eclairs and a pointed admonition.
 Such was the fare last week in Palo Alto, Calif., at a lunch with three dozen venture capitalists. The meeting was meant to be a light affair, focused on networking and alternative energy issues, but the first speaker had something heavier on his mind. 
 ''We are in a true battle,'' Mark G. Heesen, the president of the National Venture Capital Association, told the technology investors assembled. 
 On Capitol Hill, away from Silicon Valley, the venture capital industry was in a pitched fight over tax policy. The House is considering an increase in a crucial tax rate, prompting venture capitalists and their leaders to assert that such a change will hamper job creation and innovation. 
 The venture capitalists say it is the most important policy issue they have faced in years. Those who disagree accuse the technology investors of crying wolf, and of greed. 
 The question is what tax rate should apply to returns that venture capitalists receive when the companies they help build are sold for a profit. The returns, called carried interest, are taxed at the capital gains rate, 15 percent, but some in Congress want to raise the tax to the rate of ordinary income, usually about 35 percent. 
 The proposal is not aimed specifically at venture capitalists, but more broadly at private equity managers, including hedge funds.
 Supporters of the higher tax rate argue that the current structure lets private equity investors pay a lower tax rate for returns on their labor than a typical American worker. 
 ''This quirk in tax law is what allows some of the richest workers in the country to pay tax on their labor at a low rate,'' Victor Fleischer, an associate law professor at the University of Illinois, said in remarks this month before the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 The debate comes as private equity investors have racked up billions of dollars in returns, and also as Congress is seeking additional revenue to offset spending and cut taxes in other areas, most notably a reduction in the alternative minimum tax. Estimates of how much money could be raised by a change range from a few billion dollars a year to as much as $10 billion. 
 Venture capitalists argue that the proposed legislation undervalues their role in the economy. The investors say they are creating jobs through long-term investment of their sweat equity; they point out that they put in years of time and energy building companies and should be rewarded for the risk they take. 
 They are, they say, the risk takers whose investments have seeded the likes of Genentech, Google and thousands of other companies.
 If taxes rise, ''early stage companies would be harder to form and fund, reducing the overall number of venture-backed companies and hurting the lifeblood of our entrepreneurial ecosystem,'' Jonathan Silver, a venture capitalist with Core Capital Partners, told the Ways and Means Committee. 
 Beneath the surface, the debate has put venture capitalists in a tricky lobbying position. They are not necessarily seeking to torpedo the legislation but are aiming to persuade Congress that venture capitalists should be exempted from any tax increase because, they argue, they are fundamentally different from hedge funds and private equity investors. 
 This is a position that the industry's lobbyists have quietly taken with members of Congress. But as the going has gotten rough in recent weeks, the industry's leaders have raised the volume, holding a news conference this week to emphasize the role of venture capital in creating jobs and new companies. 
 Industry leaders also said that venture capital was not a ''buy it and flip it'' business. The comments were a clear effort to differentiate the business from hedge funds and other private equity investors who have gotten a reputation for making billions from taking over, streamlining, reorganizing and reselling companies. 
 Mr. Heesen, president of the industry's trade group, said lawmakers in Washington understand that distinction and typically see venture capitalists as ''white hats'' who create jobs, while perceiving buyout firms as ''black hats.''
 But Mr. Heesen is clearly not confident that Congress, if it does agree with that distinction, will exempt venture capitalists. Perhaps with good reason. Some lawmakers argue that whether or not venture capitalists create more jobs than hedge funds do, the same logic should apply to both groups on tax law. 
 That logic essentially states that ordinary income tax rates should apply to people when they are compensated for labor. If a blue-collar worker pays income tax for a day's work, then a private equity investor should pay the same rate, even if the work takes five years before the payday. 
 Venture capitalists say one difference is that their efforts entail some risk. If the companies they build are not sold, they do not profit. But critics say the venture capitalists, in addition to getting carried interest, typically take a 2 percent management fee (they pay ordinary income tax rates for those returns).
 Not all venture capitalists view the issue the same way. William Stanfill, a venture capitalist with TrailHead Ventures in Denver, told the House committee that he did not believe a higher tax rate would slow venture capital or the people engaged in it. ''We get ample compensation, financial and psychic, for the work we do and the risks we take,'' Mr. Stanfill testified, arguing that to suggest otherwise bordered on hysteria. 
 Mr. Fleischer, from the University of Illinois, said Mr. Stanfill's testimony appeared to resonate with the Congressional committee. By contrast, he said, the venture capitalists hoping to avoid a tax increase have a tough battle ahead.
 ''I'm not convinced they've made the case,'' he said, adding: ''Everybody agrees venture capital is a great industry that is a treasure for this country. But, at the same time, you don't need a special tax break to incent people to do the work.''

HEADLINE: Lost at Sea

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. KAPLAN. 
Robert D. Kaplan, a correspondent for The Atlantic and a visiting professor at the United States Naval Academy, is the author of ''Hog Pilots, Blue Water Grunts: The American Military in the Air, at Sea and on the Ground.''

 BODY:
THE ultimate strategic effect of the Iraq war has been to hasten the arrival of the Asian Century. 
 While the American government has been occupied in Mesopotamia, and our European allies continue to starve their defense programs, Asian militaries -- in particular those of China, India, Japan and South Korea -- have been quietly modernizing and in some cases enlarging. Asian dynamism is now military as well as economic.
 The military trend that is hiding in plain sight is the loss of the Pacific Ocean as an American lake after 60 years of near-total dominance. A few years down the road, according to the security analysts at the private policy group Strategic Forecasting, Americans will not to the same extent be the prime deliverers of disaster relief in a place like the Indonesian archipelago, as we were in 2005. Our ships will share the waters (and the prestige) with new ''big decks'' from Australia, Japan and South Korea.
 Then there is China, whose production and acquisition of submarines is now five times that of America's. Many military analysts feel it is mounting a quantitative advantage in naval technology that could erode our qualitative one. Yet the Chinese have been buying smart rather than across the board. 
 In addition to submarines, Beijing has focused on naval mines, ballistic missiles that can hit moving objects at sea, and technology that blocks G.P.S. satellites. The goal is ''sea denial'': dissuading American carrier strike groups from closing in on the Asian mainland wherever and whenever we like. Such dissuasion is the subtle, high-tech end of military asymmetry, as opposed to the crude, low-tech end that we've seen with homemade bombs in Iraq. Whether or not China ever has a motive to challenge America, it will increasingly have the capacity to do so.
 Certainly, the billions of dollars spent on Iraq (a war I supported) would not have gone for the expensive new air, naval and space systems necessary to retain our relative edge against a future peer competitor like China. But some of it would have. 
 China's military expansion, with a defense budget growing by double digits for the 19th consecutive year, is part of a broader, regional trend. Russia -- a Pacific as well as a European nation, we should remember -- is right behind the United States and China as the world's biggest military spender. Japan, with 119 warships, including 20 diesel-electric submarines, boasts a naval force nearly three times larger than Britain's. (It is soon to be four times larger: 13 to 19 of Britain's 44 remaining large ships are set to be mothballed by the Labor government.) 
 India's Navy could be the third-largest in the world in a few years as it becomes more active throughout the Indian Ocean, from the Mozambique Channel to the Strait of Malacca between Indonesia and Malaysia. South Korea, Singapore and Pakistan all spend higher percentages of their gross domestic products on defense than do Britain and France -- which are by far Europe's most serious military-minded nations.
 The twin trends of a rising Asia and a politically crumbling Middle East will most likely lead to a naval emphasis on the Indian Ocean and its surrounding seas, the sites of the ''brown water'' choke points of world commerce -- the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf, the Bab el Mandeb at the mouth of the Red Sea, and Malacca. These narrow bodies of water will become increasingly susceptible to terrorism, even as they become more and more clogged with tankers bringing Middle Eastern oil to the growing middle classes of India and China. The surrounding seas will then become home territory to Indian and Chinese warships, protecting their own tanker routes.
 To wit, China is giving Pakistan $200 million to build a deep-water port at Gwadar, just 390 nautical miles from the Strait of Hormuz. Beijing is also trying to work with the military junta in Myanmar to create another deep-water port on the Bay of Bengal. It has even hinted at financing a canal across the 30-mile Isthmus of Kra in Thailand that would open a new connection between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific.
 Oddly enough, the Pacific, as an organizing principle in world military affairs, will also encroach upon Africa. It's no secret that a major reason for the Pentagon's decision to establish its new Africa Command is to contain and keep an eye on China's growing web of development projects across the sub-Saharan regions.
 Still, measuring budgets, deployments, and sea and air ''platforms'' does not quite indicate just how much the ground is shifting beneath our feet. Military power rests substantially on the willingness to use it: perhaps less so in war than in peacetime as a means of leverage and coercion. 
 That, in turn, requires a vigorous nationalism -- something that is far more noticeable right now in Asia than in parts of an increasingly post-national West. As the Yale political scientist Paul Bracken notes in his book ''Fire in the East: The Rise of Asian Military Power and the Second Nuclear Age,'' the Indians, Pakistanis and Chinese have great pride in possessing nuclear weapons, unlike the Western powers that seem almost ashamed of needing them. Likewise, the right to produce nuclear arms is something that unites Iranians, regardless of their views of the clerical regime.
 Mending relations with Europe is only a partial answer to America's problems in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, since Europe itself continues to turn away from military power. This trend was quickened by the Iraq war, which has helped legitimize nascent European pacifism. People in countries like Germany, Italy and Spain see their own militaries not so much as soldiers but as civil servants in uniform: there for soft peacekeeping and humanitarian missions.
 Meanwhile, Asia is marked by rivalries that encourage traditional arms races. Despite warming economic ties between Japan and China, and between Japan and South Korea, the Japanese and Chinese have fought wars of words over possession of the Senkaku (or, as the Chinese have it, Diaoyutai) Islands in the East China Sea; just as Japanese and South Koreans have over possession of the Takeshima Islands (Tokdo Islands to the Koreans) in the Sea of Japan. These are classic territorial disputes, stirring deep emotions of the sorts that often led to war in early modern Europe. 
 Despite these tensions, the United States should also be concerned about the alternative possibility of a China-Japan entente. Some of China's recent diplomatic approaches to Japan have been couched in a new tone of respect and camaraderie, as it attempts to tame Japan's push toward rearmament and thus to reduce the regional influence of the United States.
 Asia's military-economic vigor is the product of united political, economic and military elites. In Asia, politics often does stop at the water's edge. In a post-George W. Bush America, if we do not find a way to agree on basic precepts, Iraq may indeed turn out to have been the event that signaled our military decline.
 Preventing that will require continued high military expenditures combined with an unrelenting multilateralism of a sort we have not pursued since the 1990s. In the vast oceanic spaces bordering the Pacific and Indian Oceans, air, sea and space power will be paramount both as means of deterrence and of guarding the sea lanes. A global power at peace still requires a navy and an air force deployed as far forward as possible. That costs money. Even with the gargantuan cost of Iraq, our defense budget is still under 5 percent of our gross domestic product, low by historical standards.
 Furthermore, the very vitality of nation-states in the Pacific and Indian Oceans will take us back to an older world of traditional statecraft, in which we will need to tirelessly leverage allies and seek cooperation from competitors. Thus we should take advantage of the rising risk of terrorism and piracy in order to draw the Chinese and Indian Navies into joint patrols of choke points and tanker routes.
 Still, we should be careful about leveraging Japan and India too overtly against China. The Japanese continue to be distrusted throughout Asia, particularly in the Korean Peninsula, because of the horrors of World War II. As for India, as a number of policy experts leaders there told me on a recent visit: India will remain non-aligned, with a tilt toward the United States. But any official alliance would compromise India's own shaky relationship with China. Subtlety must be a keystone to our policy. We have to draw China in, not gang up against it.
 Because we remain the only major player in the Pacific and Indian Oceans without territorial ambitions or disputes with its neighbors, indispensability, rather than dominance, must be our goal. That, continuing deep into the 21st century, would be a stirring achievement.

HEADLINE: Value of Dollar Falls to New Low against the Euro

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and IAN AUSTEN; Carter Dougherty contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Investors dumped dollars yesterday, sending the euro to a record high and putting the American currency at par with the Canadian dollar for the first time in more than 30 years. 
 In practical terms, the recent drop in the dollar's value is making Boeing jetliners and Manhattan pieds-a-terre a lot cheaper for Europeans and Canadians, while Americans will have to pay more while on vacation in Paris or when buying snowmobiles made in Quebec. 
 While the dollar has generally been drifting down against both currencies, along with the British pound, for much of this decade, its fall has gathered pace in recent weeks as traders foresee a slowing American economy while expecting more robust growth overseas.
 The Federal Reserve's decision this week to cut interest rates put further pressure on the dollar by making investment returns in other countries comparatively more lucrative. 
 As American assets become cheaper to buyers overseas, foreigners may step up their purchase of businesses and land here, creating political and cultural tensions. Yesterday, a stock exchange from Dubai, on the Persian Gulf, announced plans to take a sizable stake in Nasdaq, drawing a mixed response in Washington. And a prominent private equity firm, the Carlyle Group, sold a minority stake to the Abu Dhabi government. 
 The impact of the falling dollar is rippling through the world and American economies in numerous ways. It will give an edge to American manufacturers and has already helped lift exports by more than 11 percent in the first eight months of the year. Businesses with large foreign operations can expect a lift in profits when they convert their overseas earnings into dollars.
 On the other side of the equation, the decline in the American currency is helping push up commodity prices, most of which are denominated in dollars, and kindling fears that inflation could rise. Crude oil futures surged to $83.32 a barrel yesterday, up 2 percent from the day before and up 37 percent for the year. Long-term bonds fell sharply in value and gold prices were up 1.4 percent, to $733.26 a troy ounce.
 One euro now buys $1.4065, the first time in the common European currency's nine-year history that it has crossed the $1.40 mark. And one dollar now buys $1.0008 Canadian dollars, the first time that the two currencies have traded that closely since late 1976.
 The American currency fell nearly 1 percent against a basket of six major world currencies yesterday, and is down 8.4 percent in the last 12 months. The American stock market fell modestly yesterday after posting two days of gains.
 Many traders and economists predict that the dollar will weaken further because the American economy is expected to underperform its biggest trading partners for some time. ''The market is pricing in a shift in Fed policy downward, and the rest of the world is not matching,'' said Carl B. Weinberg, chief global economist at High Frequency Economics. ''That can only mean a cheaper dollar.'' 
 In Washington, the administration and Congress were preoccupied with the problems in the housing economy and there was little talk of the dollar. President Bush expressed confidence in the economy. ''The fundamentals of our nation's economy are strong,'' he said at a news conference. ''There is no question that there is some unsettling times in the housing market.''
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, did call on the Bush administration to review the Nasdaq deal closely, but other Democratic leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, chairman of the Financial Services Committee, said they were not alarmed by the transaction.
 More than a year ago, opposition from lawmakers forced another Dubai-owned company to back out of a plan to manage port operations around the United States and a Chinese firm gave up on a plan to acquire Unocal, an American oil company.
 For Canadians, the newfound parity with the American currency has proved to be as much a source of anxiety as pride in a country with an export-dependent economy.
 For decades, the Canadian dollar's anemic state lent it little respect. Although the currency's popular name, the loonie, comes from the bird depicted on the one-dollar coin, its alternate meaning was not lost on Canadians. In an episode of ''The Simpsons'' about the animated family's trip to Toronto shortly after the Canadian currency's collapse in 2002, Homer Simpson won over a recalcitrant security guard by waving a single American dollar bill in his face.
 The Canadian dollar's ascent is a result of the nation's strong economy, experts say. Demand, much of it from Asia, has bolstered prices for exports like minerals, oil and wheat. The development of huge oil sands projects in Alberta has created a labor shortage throughout Western Canada.
 Still, the rise in the country's currency has hit the manufacturing sector. Douglas Porter, an economist with BMO Nesbitt Burns, a brokerage firm, estimates that 250,000 industrial jobs have already disappeared because of the rise of the Canadian currency.
 As the chief economist of the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, a trade group, Jayson Myers, finds little professional joy in the Canadian dollar's ascent. But he readily acknowledged that achieving parity would lift Canadians' spirits.
 ''It makes a lot of people feel pretty good,'' he said. ''They can go on trips to the States again; they can go on trips to Europe. After 16 years of always seeing their currency in an inferior position, Canadians now have strong buying power.''
 In Europe, there was at least one call for a Continentwide effort to reverse the course of the euro, which is used as the official currency in 13 countries. ''Let's say that it's a change in level that concerns all of us Europeans, and it's clearly a point we must address together among Europeans,'' the French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, said during a trip to China, according to Reuters.
 Evidence is starting to emerge that the euro's strength is chipping away at sales. Ralf Wiechers, chief economist for VDMA, an association of German machine-tool makers whose performance has been the backbone of the country's boom, said that the currency values are starting to hurt earnings despite continued gains in sales.
 ''The world economy is creating the volume,'' Mr. Wiechers said. ''The exchange rate is starting to decide what the profit margin is.''
 In the American Midwest, manufacturers say they are seeing more business, in part, because the weaker dollar has made them more competitive on the world market.
 Kendig Kneen, chief executive of Al-Jon Manufacturing in Ottumwa, Iowa, said his scrap recycling and waste management equipment business had been growing up to 30 percent annually and that he had expanded his payroll to 150 from 100 workers a year ago. He estimates that about half the growth is a result of the weaker dollar, with the rest coming from stronger global demand for scrap recycling.
 ''We are in a world market,'' he said. ''People have heard that phrase global economy for the last 10 to 15 years. It's just now that they are starting to believe it.''

HEADLINE: Shares and Dollar Drop; Oil Surges

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday as a weakened dollar and a surge in oil prices kindled fresh concerns about inflation, snuffing out a two-day rally that followed the Federal Reserve's deep cut in a crucial interest rate.
 Initial optimism that the Fed's aggressive move would keep the economy out of recession gave way to concerns about the inflationary impact of a flagging dollar, which raises the cost of imported goods.
 Banks and brokerage firms slid, meanwhile, as investors locked in gains booked since the rate cut on Tuesday. Shares of Lehman Brothers, which rose 10 percent after Lehman reported strong quarterly results on Tuesday, fell 2.8 percent, to $62.31. 
 ''The U.S. has cut rates, and so it's less attractive to hold dollars,'' said Milton Ezrati, senior economic strategist at Lord Abbett & Company in New York. ''I think it causes an adjustment in all asset classes denominated by dollars.'' 
 But he added, ''It's not at all surprising that the market would go down, even without the dollar, after the last couple of days of enthusiasm.''
 Scattered evidence pointing to a prolonged economic slowdown further soured the mood.
 FedEx, the package delivery company whose performance serves as a business barometer, lowered its profit outlook for the full year, citing a tepid economic environment. Its shares dropped 2.9 percent, to $104.45, while the Dow Jones transport average fell 1.9 percent.
 The National Retail Federation said holiday sales were expected to rise 4 percent, to $474.5 billion -- their slowest pace in five years -- sending the Standard & Poor's retail index down 2 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 48.86 points, or 0.35 percent, to end at 13,766.70. The S.& P. 500-stock index was down 10.28 points, or 0.67 percent, to finish at 1,518.75. The Nasdaq composite index was down 12.19 points, or 0.46 percent, to close at 2,654.29.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 1 7/32, to 100 13/32, for a yield of 4.70 percent, up 16 basis points in just a day. Bond yields move inversely to prices.
 Crude oil settled at a record $83.32 a barrel, gaining $1.39, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Bear Stearns shares slipped 0.2 percent, to close at $115.46, reversing an earlier gain of 3.3 percent to a session high at $119.50. The investment bank posted a sharply lower profit, but its chief financial officer, Samuel L. Molinaro Jr., said the worst of times were behind the company. He said he saw business returning to normal in 2008.
 Other investment banks' shares also dropped, including those of Morgan Stanley, down 3.6 percent, at $64.63. The S.& P. financial index was down 1.7 percent. The Dow Jones home construction index, which also rose sharply after the Fed's rate cut, dropped 5.7 percent.
 Among retailers, shares of Home Depot fell 2.4 percent, to $35.32.
 Shares of Circuit City Stores plummeted 18 percent, to $8.67, after the home electronics seller reported a larger-than-forecast quarterly loss.
 Trading was below average on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.27 billion shares changing hands. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of about 12 to 5 on the New York Exchange.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art has published a richly illustrated two-volume scholarly catalog of its 17th-century Dutch holdings by the curator Walter Liedtke that sells for $150 in its shops. But there are cheaper alternatives that also shed light on Dutch art and culture of the 17th century. Following is a small sampling. (Where possible, paperback versions are listed; some books have been heavily discounted by online sellers, although list prices are cited here.) 
 'THE AGE OF REMBRANDT: DUTCH PAINTINGS IN THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART,' by Esmee Quodbach. A reprint of the summer issue of the Met's Art Bulletin, with an essay tracing the history of the museum's Dutch acquisitions and donors' collecting habits. 72 pages. $25. 
 'THE EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES: AN INTERPRETATION OF DUTCH CULTURE IN THE GOLDEN AGE,' by Simon Schama. A sweeping and spicy portrait of Dutch life -- religious beliefs, work habits, tastes in art, tulip speculation, ardor for household thrift and hygiene -- in the 17th century. 720 pages. $24. 
 'THE REMBRANDT BOOK,' by Gary Schwartz. An overview of the artist's life and oeuvre (as well as fractious attribution disputes), with 700 color illustrations. $65. 
 'VERMEER AND THE DELFT SCHOOL,' by Walter Liedtke, with Michiel C. Plomp and Axel Ruger. Catalog for a 2001 Met show exploring how Vermeer's luminous paintings emerged from a crucible of collaborative influences, patronage and local freedom. 550 pages. $85.
 'VERMEER AND HIS MILIEU: A WEB OF SOCIAL HISTORY,' by John Michael Montias. A pathbreaking social and economic analysis of 17th-century life -- artists, auctions, burghers, guilds, military contractors, cattle raising -- drawing on the archives of 17 Dutch and Belgian towns. A particular emphasis on Vermeer and his paintings, patrons and economic struggles. 472 pages. $42.
 'THE ART OF DESCRIBING: DUTCH ART IN THE 17TH CENTURY,' by Svetlana Alpers. An analysis of the 17th-century Dutch passion for visual culture (seeing, describing, mapping), in contrast to the textual emphasis (allegory, emblems, philosophy) of Italian Renaissance art. 302 pages. $28. 
 'THE ISLAND AT THE CENTER OF THE WORLD: THE EPIC STORY OF DUTCH MANHATTAN AND THE FORGOTTEN COLONY THAT SHAPED AMERICA,' by Russell Shorto. A vivid slice of New York history under the city's early Dutch settlers. It argues for the importance of Dutch Manhattan in setting an example of religious and racial tolerance for a young America. 384 pages. $30.

HEADLINE: What So Proudly We Hailed

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
World War II didn't happen just to us.
 But it would be hard to glean that from Ken Burns's 7-night, 15-hour tribute to the greatest generation that ever bought war bonds, joined the Marines or tightened rivets on a B-17 Flying Fortress. 
 The London blitz, Stalingrad, Bergen-Belsen and the Warsaw uprising are parentheses in this respectful, moving and meticulously illustrated anthology of small-town lives turned upside down by what one elderly veteran calls ''a necessary war.'' 
 The war was necessary, but is this approach? 
 The tone and look of Mr. Burns's series, which begins Sunday on PBS, is as elegiac and compelling as any of his previous works, but particularly now, as the conflict in Iraq unravels, this degree of insularity -- at such length and detail -- is disconcerting. Many a ''Frontline'' documentary has made a convincing case that the Bush administration's mistakes were compounded by the blinkered thinking of leaders who rushed to war without sufficient support around the world or understanding of the religious and sectarian strains on the ground. Examining a global war from the perspective of only one belligerent is rarely a good idea.
 Campaign debates, standardized tests and game-show questions all suggest that as the global economy expands, Americans are growing more hidebound and parochial. And now comes a beautifully made telecourse on wartime America under the definitive title ''The War.'' 
 World War II is as fascinating and terrible a subject as we have, but America's role in defeating Germany and Japan has not been underestimated in this country. And it can hardly be argued that the heroes of Guadalcanal and D-Day remain unheralded. 
 The last decade alone produced a welcome profusion of best-selling books and films that focus on the sacrifice of individual Americans caught up in a global calamity. These include Tom Brokaw's ''Greatest Generation'' and the collaborations of Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, the happy few who made ''Saving Private Ryan'' and ''Band of Brothers.'' Along with Clint Eastwood (''Flags of Our Fathers,'' ''Letters From Iwo Jima'') they are Hollywood's leading World War II aficionados: Band of Buffs. (Mr. Hanks is one of the voices of ''The War,'' bringing to life the homespun columns of Al McIntosh, the editor of The Rock County Star Herald in Luverne, Minn.)
 Mr. Burns is a distinguished filmmaker who specializes in epic tributes to American history, from ''The Civil War'' in 1990 to ''Baseball'' in 1994 and ''Jazz'' in 2001, three subjects that are indisputably indigenous to the United States. So it is perhaps understandable that he would view the Second World War as a mostly domestic concern. But in 1944 infantrymen in the Ardennes followed every step of the Red Army's advance. Certainly the men and women serving in uniform at the time were more curious about other fronts than Mr. Burns is.
 Public television is too often in a defensive crouch, fending off attacks by right-wing groups that accuse it of liberal bias. That insecurity has perhaps driven PBS to underestimate its audience's appetite for widened horizons. 
 In 1974 Americans were captivated by all 26 episodes of ''The World at War,'' a British-made documentary, narrated by Laurence Olivier, that was shown on public television and even today stands up as one of the best historical looks at World War II. It was told from a British perspective, but German, Japanese and American witnesses and veterans were also interviewed, including Alger Hiss, who was a State Department adviser to Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Paul Tibbets, the pilot of the Enola Gay when it bombed Hiroshima.
 Networks give viewers the stories they want to see. The mission of public television is also to provide the history people ought to know.
 It is of course commendable that a filmmaker archive the memories of veterans who will not be around much longer to tell their stories. And it is impossible not to be touched -- and troubled -- by them. 
 Most of the film is rooted in the experiences of four towns. Waterbury, Conn.; Mobile, Ala.; and Sacramento were small patches that swelled into defense production centers, while the tiny farming town of Luverne stood still, held its breath and waited for the war to send home its boys. 
 The film's central theme is that the war indelibly marked the entire country. ''We gathered outside of Langdon Hall at Auburn and they had a loudspeaker truck, and we stood there quietly and listened to President Roosevelt declare war,'' Katharine Phillips, who was a young woman in Mobile at the time, recalls. ''And, of course, our whole life changed.'' 
 Her brother, Sidney, was in the second wave of marines to storm the beaches of Guadalcanal, a battle that began with almost no opposition and later became one of the bloodier in the Pacific. The film shows Mr. Phillips with his back to the camera, relieving himself -- a random shot taken by a combat photographer. The calm didn't last, and Mr. Phillips soon found himself in jungle warfare under unspeakable conditions. He weighed 125 pounds when he finally got out. 
 Some of the wartime footage has been rarely seen and is extraordinarily immediate, like clips of starving soldiers on the Bataan Death March, piles of dead bodies from the Battle of the Bulge, and lesser-known scenes of Nazi death camps. 
 Mr. Burns conscientiously weaves those harrowing images around the story of the home front in all its glorious and inglorious moments: not just victory gardens and tin collection drives, but also the internment of Japanese-Americans, the segregation of African-Americans in the service and the discrimination against African-Americans seeking defense jobs in cities like Mobile. 
 But one of the problems with trying to paint a picture of domestic life during World War II in small, pointillist strokes is that some people inevitably feel left out. Hispanic groups were incensed that Mr. Burns did not pay enough attention to Latino soldiers who also served and died. The filmmakers added the recollections of two men from East Los Angeles who served in combat on Guadalcanal, as well as an American Indian, from a Crow reservation near Lodge Grass, Mont., who relied on his tribe's warrior tradition to get through his first taste of battle. 
 One of the more familiar faces is that of Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, the son of a Japanese immigrant, who was 17 and living in Hawaii when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. He joined the infantry and lost an arm in combat in Italy, and he recalls an aid-station amputation without anesthesia that was so painful ''that dying didn't seem like such an awful idea.''
 The historian Paul Fussell, who was a second lieutenant when he was wounded in France, and Samuel Hynes, an emeritus professor of English who was a Marine combat pilot, are especially eloquent. But perhaps the most memorable descriptions of combat are the diary jottings of Eugene Sledge, a soldier from Mobile who survived, barely, some of the worst fighting in the Pacific and died in 2001. 
 ''Something in me died at Peleliu,'' Mr. Sledge wrote after the war. ''Possibly I lost faith that politicians in high places who do not have to endure war's savagery will ever stop blundering and sending others to endure it.''
 ''The War'' gives generous voice to a wide variety of remarkable people, but they are all American voices. Mr. Burns delivers almost everything viewers care to know about wartime America; it's also telling that this is the only tale he wants to tell.

HEADLINE: Using 300 Sellers as a Window on the Drug Market

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL

 BODY:
For pharmaceuticals, the Consumer Price Index tries to track changes over time for an average consumer's retail costs for drugs, including what an insurance company would pay. 
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the drug index, samples 300 retail outlets that are chosen on the basis of census data showing where Americans buy their drugs: chain pharmacies, neighborhood drugstores, larger discount stores and mail-order outlets.
 Using that information, the bureau develops a list of drugs culled from the 20 prescriptions most recently filled when representatives visit each outlet in the sample. Typically, the list includes commonly used medications like cholesterol and blood pressure drugs and antibiotics.
 The prices for those exact prescriptions are then followed for two years, until a new selection process begins. 
 Six months after a drug included in the sample becomes available as a generic, the Department of Labor recalibrates its sample to reflect whether people at the outlet have switched to the generic version. That change in the data-tracking method was made in 1995. 
 Daniel H. Ginsburg, a supervisory economist for the Consumer Price Index, said the 1995 change was an effort to reflect actual prices consumers pay. ''This is a good example of how our methodology evolves,'' he said, ''and, hopefully, gets better.''

HEADLINE: After Flooding, M.T.A. Plans Subway Fixes

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority unveiled plans yesterday for significant and costly changes to subway stations to prevent the shutdown of service that followed last month's intense flooding.
 The proposals include new ways to keep water out of the stations, like raising ventilation grates off the ground and building steps at subway entrances that would require passengers to walk up before descending into stations but would prevent rain from flowing downward.
 The authority said it was also establishing an emergency response center, planning to install new valves in drain pipes to keep out stormwater and developing a system of customized e-mail and text message alerts for each subway line so riders would know about problems.
 The authority's executive director, Elliot G. Sander, said short-term improvements, like raising the grates or installing valves, would cost $30 million. But more extensive projects under consideration, such as increasing sewer or pumping capacity, could cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take at least several years. There was no immediate indication of how the authority, which is facing a financial crisis, would find the money for the projects. 
 Mr. Sander said at a news conference in Midtown Manhattan that an unexpectedly heavy storm like the one that hit the city on Aug. 8 could still disrupt transit, but he promised the agency would be better prepared and faster in responding. 
 The planned changes ''will certainly dramatically mitigate the impact,'' Mr. Sander said as he unveiled a report on the flooding.
 Gov. Eliot Spitzer had ordered the report detailing what went wrong and how it could be avoided in the future. The storm affected up to 2.3 million commuters, leaving many angry, hot and stranded.
 The 115-page report -- prepared by transit officials; Barry L. Kluger, the authority's inspector general; and the city's transportation and environmental protection commissioners -- concluded that the authority was caught flat-footed for a number of reasons, including its inability to foresee the severity of the storm, its limited pumping capacity and an aged, porous infrastructure open to runoff from streets and storm drains.
 The deluge dumped as much as 3.4 inches of rain on parts of the city within a few hours and overwhelmed the transit system.
 The report singled out the transportation authority's failure to communicate with its workers and riders as a significant factor in the chaos that followed the storm.
 The report called for providing portable devices like BlackBerrys to station personnel, although that solution would work only for those above ground. Workers in underground stations would have to wait until those areas are equipped for wireless service, which is expected to take several years. 
 The report also said that about 120 subway stations had no public address system for communicating with passengers and suggested that projects to install more speakers be accelerated.
 ''In many instances, customers could not get reliable information,'' the report said. It concluded that station agents, train crews and bus operators ''had insufficient, conflicting or no information to share with confused and frustrated customers.''
 New York City Transit also provided yesterday, for the first time, an almost minute-by-minute account of the system breakdown, mainly from train and track workers' accounts.
 The timeline brings home the startling rapidity with which rain flooded the system in 26 places and eventually brought service to a soggy standstill.
 The first report of trouble came in to the subway's rail control center at 5:59 a.m., when a conductor at the 34th Street station on the Eighth Avenue line in Manhattan radioed in that he saw ''a heavy flow of water coming from a pipe'' and spilling onto the platform. 
 After that, things deteriorated rapidly as reports came in from across the system. At 6:05 a.m. at Cortlandt Street, in Lower Manhattan, water was rising fast on the tracks. At 6:06 a.m., at the Long Island City/Court Square station in Queens, there was another report of water on the tracks. A minute later, at the Jay Street/Borough Hall station in Brooklyn, water began pouring through sidewalk vents. At the same time, a storm sewer at the 23rd Street station on the Lexington Avenue line in Manhattan began backing up and spewing water onto the tracks. 
 All told, between 5:59 and 7:04, there were reports of flooding at 22 locations in the subway system, according to the chronology. By 11:33, four more places reported flooding. 
 The effect of the rain appeared helter-skelter, pouring into some of the areas that have been chronically flood-prone, but also inundating stations that have not flooded in recent years, such as Flushing Avenue in Brooklyn.
 The four subway stations that have flooded most often in recent years -- 79th Street in Manhattan and, in Queens, Parsons Boulevard, 65th Street and 36th Street -- flooded again this time. But of the 10 stations next on the list of flood-prone areas, seven did not experience flooding. The authority said that was at least in part because of steps taken after the last major flood, in September 2004. Those include cleaning drains along the tracks and, at one station, installing temporary pumps.
 Some of the reports from train operators and other transit personnel gave particularly eerie perspectives of how the storm was felt underground. 
 At 7:05 a.m., a train operator on a No. 4 train at 23rd Street radioed controllers that ''there were sparks and smoke emitting from the water saturated tracks and it was unsafe to proceed.''
 About 25 minutes earlier, the timeline noted an exchange in which controllers asked when a work crew would be able to get to the station to deal with the flooding. The response came back that ''due to high volume of reported water conditions they would be unable to provide an estimated time of arrival at this time.''
 The strange mixture of fire and water seen at 23rd Street was visible elsewhere. At the Jay Street/Borough Hall station at 6:07 a.m., a train crew reported a fire under the third rail, saying that ''smoke and flames are creating an unsafe condition for the train to proceed all the way into the station.'' 
 The timeline does not make clear how long it took work crews to get to places where they were needed, but transit officials said yesterday that they had done a good job of bringing the system back into operation in a timely manner. 
 By 9:30 a.m. service had begun to come back on several lines, and in most places service was at or close to normal by 6:30 p.m., according to the transit agency's accounting.
 The authority's report, however, suggested that a number of factors made a bad day worse, including mistakes by managers. It said subway managers are trained to respond to individual incidents, like a problem on a single line. The agency also has protocols for dealing with a total system shutdown, as in a blackout.
 But during last month's flooding, it said, officials got wrapped up in responding to individual reports of flooding and failed to see quickly enough that the whole system was shutting down. 
 Mr. Sander said the authority had now created an Emergency Response Center at its Midtown headquarters to better coordinate its efforts in an emergency. 
 He also said that locations where flooding had occurred would be studied for solutions and that the authority would work with the city to find answers in areas where the storm sewer system had frequently been unable to handle heavy rains.

 Museums
 ASIA SOCIETY: 'ZHANG HUAN: ALTERED STATES,' through Jan. 20. The Chinese artist Zhang Huan, the subject of this small, midcareer survey, is best known for the early, often poetic, sometimes sensationally masochistic performance work he did in the 1990s, which can only be seen in videos and photographs now. The objects in this show, which include giant fragments of Buddhist sculptures made from copper sheets and incense ash, are products of his new workshop-style studio in Shanghai. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org.

 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'CAMILLE PISSARRO: IMPRESSIONS OF CITY AND COUNTRY,' through Feb. 3. This exhibition contains few out-and-out masterpieces, but it does give us a rare look at the radical philosophies behind paintings that to a modern eye appear harmlessly bourgeois. For Pissarro, an anarchist and a Jew (albeit a secular one) in 19th-century France, Impressionism was about much more than the fleeting effects of light. It was about labor, the elimination of hierarchies and an idealized balance between urban and rural life. Pissarro emerges from this exhibition as an artist who never quite resolved the conflict between labor and sensation, but whose subtly anti-authoritarian stance propelled painting into the next century. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. 
 (Karen Rosenberg)
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'BRIDGING EAST AND WEST: THE CHINESE DIASPORA AND LIN YUTANG,' through Feb. 10. Focused on a single modern family art collection, this show weaves like a DNA strand through the Met's Chinese painting galleries. The 40 examples of painting and calligraphy belonged to the writer and scholar Lin Yutang (1895-1976) and his descendants, who have divided their time between China and the West. Accumulated over years, the collection has the casual logic of a household photo album, with evidence of shared habits, tastes and temperaments, and of personal interchange between generations. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org.
 (Cotter) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'REPICTURING THE PAST/PICTURING THE PRESENT,' through Nov. 5. Modern and contemporary artists reconsider both the picture book and standard narrative in works that use mythology, history and current events as their source material. Several pieces, like those by Max Beckmann, Christian Boltanski and William Kentridge, mine the 20th century's major conflicts. Religion enters in a variety of guises, as in James Ensor's ''Entrance of Christ Into Brussels'' or versions of ''The Temptation of Saint Anthony'' by Odilon Redon and Tim Rollins & K.O.S. (Kids of Survival). The legacy of slavery is addressed in Glenn Ligon's lithographs and Kara Walker's ''Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated),'' which will also complement the retrospective of Ms. Walker's work that opens at the Whitney in October. (212) 708-9400, moma.org.

 QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'IL LEE: BALLPOINT DRAWINGS,' through Sept. 30. A selection of drawings -- striking indigo and black ink abstractions, all done exclusively in ballpoint pen, on paper and canvas -- makes up this engrossing show by the veteran Korean artist Il Lee. The centerpiece is a 50-foot drawing that took two and a half months and 400 to 500 ballpoint pens to complete, with the artist working on sections at a time that were propped up against the wall in his Brooklyn studio. It is a sweeping, rhythmical abstraction in blue, recalling the Italian Futurist paintings of Giacomo Balla, combined with elements of traditional Asian ink and wash painting. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. 
 (Benjamin Genocchio)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'RUDOLF STINGEL,' through Oct. 14. The work of this Italian-born artist, who is based in New York, seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. His favored materials include carpet and Styrofoam, as well as paint on canvas. His style swings between abstract purity and Photo Realism. His grandly spare survey has a mirrored floor and a foil-covered room, lighted by a crystal chandelier, that visitors may mark on and that he may or may not later appropriate as a painting. As enthralling as it is perturbing, his work combines beauty, humor and a democratic slant with a rigorous sense of economy. It also forms one of the best-looking exhibitions seen lately at the Whitney. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org.

 Galleries: 57th Street
 'AMERICANS IN PARIS: ABSTRACT PAINTING IN THE FIFTIES' This show comes loaded with associations: Gertrude Stein and Hemingway, Gershwin's tone poem. Paintings here echo what was popular in New York in the 1950s. Although the canvases aren't as large, the gestures are big, and bold colors, splatters and drips abound in works by Al Held, Norman Bluhm, Seymour Boardman, Shirley Jaffe, Joan Mitchell and Sam Francis. One artist who ran against the Abstract Expressionist tide is Ellsworth Kelly, whose horizontal collage with hard-edged stripes makes him seem less like an American in Paris than a painter forecasting Daniel Buren -- or what the French would do in the 1960s. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, tibordenagy.com, through Sept. 29. (Schwendener)
 'KOREAN FUNERARY FIGURES: COMPANIONS FOR THE JOURNEY TO THE OTHER WORLD' What makes this somewhat unusual for a show of mortuary art is that the kkoktu, or figures adorning funeral biers, were created for ordinary citizens rather than for aristocrats or the wealthy. They're also rather fun and friendly. Brightly painted clowns, acrobats and animals were meant to accompany the dead into the next world, to ease the journey and provide consolation for the mourners. Among the 74 kkoktu are versions of ''The Guide,'' riding an animal; ''The Guard,'' who protects the soul from evil spirits; ''The Caregiver'' (generally women); and ''The Entertainer,'' as well as a replica of a funeral bier modeled on a late-18th-century original from Tongyoung, South Kyongsang Province. The Korea Society, 950 Third Avenue, (212) 759-7525, koreasociety.org, through Nov. 20. 
 (Schwendener)
 TRACEY ROSE A video re-enactment of a panel presentation cum performance at the Brooklyn Museum last spring finds Tracey Rose lambasting the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art. The charge? Lack of representation of nonwhite artists and theorists. The substance of Ms. Rose's performance isn't new. Artists and writers have long accused second-wave feminism of focusing on gender disparities while ignoring race and class. (''It was a movement for white women,'' Ms. Rose says. ''They said they were fighting men, but they give birth to white men, they marry them ...'' and so on.) While Ms. Rose's presentation might not make for great art, it makes for good dialogue. The Project, 37 West 57th Street, (212) 688-1585, elproyecto.com, through Sept. 29.

 Galleries: Chelsea
 'DOCUMENTA 5' This art extravaganza first occurred in Kassel, Germany, 35 years before this summer's 12th incarnation, and its achievements tend to be shrouded in myth. As the first lavish international exhibition to play up Minimal and Conceptual art, it upset lots of people, including not a few Minimalists and Conceptualists. Centering on the first exhibition's distinctive orange three-ring catalog, this meticulous show revisits its publications, press coverage, controversies and various byproducts, like a shopping bag by Joseph Beuys. It is highly educational and unexpectedly riveting. Specific Object, 601 West 26th Street, Room M285, (212) 242-6253, specificobject.com, through Oct. 8. (Smith) NATALIE FRANK: 'WHERE SHE STOPS' There is a heavy dose of Lucien Freud in Natalie Frank's paintings. She also borrows from Paula Rego, Jenny Saville and Cecily Brown. From American painters she adopts Delia Brown's interest in the decorative and decadent, and Eric Fischl's psychosexual narratives. The hybrid British-American lineage makes sense since Ms. Frank studied at the Slade in London and earned a Master of Fine Arts from Columbia in New York. The real friction comes from seeing a painter in her 20s exhibiting works in Chelsea that look like something you'd see in traditionalist strongholds on 57th Street. The implication seems to be that there's something radical in Ms. Frank's approach to figurative painting, when really there's not. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com, through Oct. 13. (Schwendener)
 DANA FRANKFORT: 'DF' In her disappointing Chelsea gallery show, this promising young artist continues to mine the busy intersection of painting and language. While she has expended a lot of her energy effectively developing her considerable instinct for color, her paint handling loses out. Harried and splintery, it suggests both a parody of expressionism and genuine emotional turmoil. A greater effort is needed. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, (212) 929-5959, bellwethergallery.com, through Oct. 6. (Smith)
 MATT KEEGAN: 'ANY DAY NOW' AND JEDEDIAH CAESAR: 'THREE VIEWS FROM SPACE' In side-by-side first shows at this gallery, two young artists appear to be diametric opposites. Making frequent use of an X-Acto knife, Matt Keegan favors surgical precision in various uses of language, complex printing and dry wall. Jedediah Caesar is big on dumb, random matter: quantities of trash compressed into large chunks of cast resin that are then sliced; they're balanced between beautiful and tacky. A great deal of oddly satisfying, intelligently focused details accumulate in the overlap between the artists. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460, damelioterras.com, through Sept. 29. (Smith)
 'MAKERS AND MODELERS: WORKS IN CERAMIC' This show of ceramic sculptures by 30 artists is beyond timely, even if the choices are at times too Gladstone-centric and cautiously mainstream. There are several outstanding efforts, among them Rosemarie Trockel's wryly beautiful day bed, Anne Chu's toasty ''Hellish Spirits'' (life size) and Andrew Lord's ambitious experiment in ceramic outreach. Kai Althoff, Anish Kapoor, Liz Larner, Rebecca Warren and, of course, the great Ken Price reward attention, as do newcomers like Gert and Uwe Tobias, Klara Kristalova and, the show's biggest splash, William O'Brien. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9300, gladstonegallery.com, through Oct. 13. (Smith)
 ARLENE SHECHET: 'NEW WORK' This terrific show 23 years into a productive career offers evocative glazed ceramic vessel-sculptures. One group of elaborately bulbous, ostensibly monochrome forms conjures scholar's rocks, genie-sprouting lamps, hookahs and ungainly, if abstracted, dancers. Another meditates on the Japanese tea ceremony with fat, roughly scooped-out cylinders mottled with textures and colors. Throughout, multiple spouts conjure up pot handles, limbs and snouts, especially the trunk of Ganesh, the Hindu elephant god. Elizabeth Harris Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 463-9666, eharrisgallery.com, through Oct. 6. (Smith)

 'THE GEOMETRY OF HOPE: LATIN AMERICAN ABSTRACT ART FROM THE PATRICIA PHELPS DE CISNEROS COLLECTION' A must-see for anyone interested in modern art, this quietly groundbreaking show tells the story of postwar abstraction from a radically different angle: that of the Latin American artists who, starting in the 1940s, extended their possibilities without resorting to Surrealism. They delved into new materials before the Minimalists, gave Op art a helpfully physical twist, pushed form toward function (and performance) and generally opted for a dancing, off-kilter, open-ended geometry greatly at odds with the four-square machismo reductivism of many of their North American counterparts. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, at Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 988-6780, www.nyu.edu/greyart, through Dec. 8. (Smith)
 Last Chance
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RICHARD POUSETTE-DART' The youngest member of the first generation of Abstract Expressionists, Pousette-Dart (1916-1992) helped break the ice for the movement, only to be omitted from its histories. This show, while too small to make sense of his enormous output, confirms his originality, but also that he did his best work after 1960, when he extended his Ab-Ex origins into an eccentric hybrid of Minimal and Op Art that is alternately hallucinatory and kitschy. His late paintings don't so much hang on the wall as float in front of it, looking like either planes of granular light or slabs of jeweled stucco. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org; closes on Tuesday. (Smith)
 THE LATH PICTURE SHOW' The title signals that a certain predominance of wood -- raw, finished, real, fake -- among the efforts of 20 contemporary artists. It is deployed in assorted forms to cheerfully crowded nearly carnivalesque effect. There is leaning, stacking, signage, old-fashioned carpentry, as well as photography and installation. Unless you count Robert Melee's colorful, wall-size variation on rec room decor (and parquet flooring), painting is absent. In other words, playing on Peter Bogdanovich's 1971 movie, this is the show beyond ''The Last Picture Show.''

 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'ORGANIZING CHAOS' With John Cage as spirit guide, this exhibition presents eight works by eight artists in eight large galleries with no muss, no fuss, no nasty spillover, although this doesn't rule out many interesting connections. The subject of ''organizing chaos'' is broached in film, video, text and photographs that alternate between macrocosmic and microcosmic, silence and noise, anarchic and tightly scripted. Orchestras, entropy, human hatred and life in the studio, the Sunday papers and the backyard are invoked in contributions from Luke Fowler, Rivane Neuenschwander and Caohe seems to have dropped the accent on his first name in most sites Guimaraes, Bruce Nauman, Christian Marclay, Tomoko Takahashi, Robert Smithson, Hans-Peter Feldmann and Stephen Vitiello. A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org; closes on Monday. (Smith)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'PETER YOUNG: 1963-1977' This ebullient show retraces the rapid rise of a maverick abstract painter who made it big and then took a pass, leaving town to settle eventually in Bisbee, Ariz. With the dot as his main staple, he worked in an array of styles, mixing Color Field, Minimalism and Process Art as he pleased. There are near-Photo-Realist images of streaming galaxies; luscious motifs derived from folding bare canvas onto painted canvas; and quirky, geometric line paintings stretched on tree branches. The show is a blast from the past that singes the present. (See above.) Closes on Monday. (Smith)

HEADLINE: Economic Indicators Drop the Most in 6 Months as Confidence Ebbs

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The index of leading economic indicators fell in August by the most in six months, reflecting lower consumer confidence and a rise in initial claims for unemployment insurance.
 The indicators index, compiled by the Conference Board, declined 0.6 percent, more than forecast, after a 0.7 percent increase in July that was larger than initially reported, the group, based in New York, said yesterday. The index points to the direction of the economy over the next three to six months. 
 The data underlined concerns that the economy might be in danger of stalling as a real estate slump, tougher lending standards and a recently softer job market threaten consumer spending.
 As it lowered interest rates on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee said that harder-to-get credit had ''the potential to intensify the housing correction, and to restrain economic growth more generally.'' 
 Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York, commented: ''Leading indicators are saying there are more storms ahead for the economy. The credit crunch in August appears to have spilled over to the real economy, and this means the outlook is less positive today.''
 The index had been forecast to fall 0.4 percent.
 First-time applications for jobless benefits rose to a weekly average of 323,200 in August from 306,800 in July. Earlier in the month, the Labor Department reported that payrolls fell in August by 4,000, the first month the economy had lost jobs since 2003.
 But last week, the jobless claims dropped by 9,000, to 311,000, a department report showed yesterday. The four-week moving average of initial claims, which is a less volatile measure, declined to 320,750 from 324,250.
 Reduced confidence would presumably cause many consumers to be more frugal in their spending decisions. Indeed, CarMax, the biggest used-car dealer in the nation, said its fiscal second-quarter profit fell short of its goals and on Wednesday lowered its profit forecast for the rest of the fiscal year because of slower sales and higher credit costs.
 A fall in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index subtracted 0.17 percentage point from the consumer confidence index. 
 Money supply adjusted for inflation, which has the largest weighting in the index, added 0.33 percentage point, the only positive contribution to the August reading. The average workweek was unchanged.
 New orders for consumer goods, orders for nonmilitary capital goods and building permits all subtracted from the gauge. Building permits, a sign of future construction, fell to an annual pace of 1.307 million in August, the lowest since 1995, according to Commerce Department figures.

HEADLINE: The Week Of Saying Never Mind

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
''When somebody persuades me I am wrong, I change my mind. What do you do?''
 -- John Maynard Keynes
 Six weeks ago, the Federal Reserve thought the American economy would easily weather problems in the credit market. One week ago, the Bank of England warned against the risks of bailing out those who had made risky loans.
 This was a week to say ''never mind.'' The Fed cut interest rates and the British authorities decided that they would effectively guarantee the deposits of every British bank, after a run developed on one bank that had gambled in the mortgage market. 
 It is a measure of the continued confidence in the power and wisdom of central bankers that markets around the world rallied. Both moves showed that the bankers had grown more fearful of credit market contractions damaging economies, but investors initially chose to focus on the action rather than the fears.
 By yesterday, however, the markets were moving in ways that cannot have made the Fed happy. The dollar fell -- an expected result from cutting short-term interest rates -- but long-term rates rose, and so did mortgage rates.
 ''Alan Greenspan's conundrum is becoming Ben Bernanke's calamity,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, recalling that when the Fed raised short-term rates under Mr. Greenspan, long-term rates did not follow. Now the opposite is happening, a fact that will make it that much harder to stimulate the economy.
 Those wanting to understand the Fed's reversal can profit from reading two papers by Fed officials, released this summer as the credit squeeze was worsening. 
 In total, they constitute an admission that the Fed was surprised by the housing and borrowing boom on the upside, and now fears it will be surprised on the downside.
 One paper, by Karen E. Dynan, a Fed economist, and Donald L. Kohn, the Fed's vice chairman, asked why a strong economy had left Americans deeper in debt than ever before.
 ''The most important factors behind the rise in debt and the associated decline in saving out of current income have probably been the combination of increasing house prices and financial innovation,'' they concluded. In other words, Wall Street and rising home prices made it easier to borrow more money, and consumers did so.
 That led to more consumption than would have been expected. Now, the authors say, ''an unexpected leveling out or decline'' in home values could have the opposite effect. 
 And, Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed governor, said in the other paper that could, in turn, have a bigger effect on the economy than the Fed anticipated. 
 ''Although I generally do not place the housing and mortgage markets close to the epicenter of previous cases of financial instability,'' he wrote, ''I would note that the current situation in the U.S. could prove to be different.''
 Mr. Mishkin said he had modified one Fed economic model, and concluded that a 20 percent fall in home prices could cause consumer spending to fall by 2 percent within two years, about twice what the old model forecast.
 But that was not the point Mr. Mishkin wanted to emphasize. Instead, his model showed that much of that damage could be averted if the Fed acted rapidly to cut rates -- as it is now doing.
 In the background is a debate that has been simmering in central bank circles as to whether the banks should pay attention to asset prices in setting monetary policy. It flared after the technology stock bubble popped six years ago, and is back now, with some saying a too-easy Fed policy brought on a housing bubble.
 Mr. Mishkin doubts the Fed could do a good job of bubble spotting in home prices or anything else, and he sees no need to try. After all, he writes, ''the monetary authorities have the tools to limit the negative effects on the economy from a house-price decline.''
 Mr. Mishkin's view remains the standard one for central bankers, but not the only one. He notes with disapproval that the Swedish central bank raised rates last year in response to soaring home prices, and says surveys showed that the move ''confused the public and led to a general weakening of confidence in the Swedish central bank.''
 That may be so, but it is far too early to reach any conclusions. What can be seen is that, so far, housing starts have fallen much more rapidly in Sweden than in the United States, but the Swedish economy is still growing a bit faster than the American one. 
 Mr. Mishkin is an economist who has done extensive work on financial instability, and his confidence is reassuring, even though the Fed's actions will do nothing to directly affect the drying up of loans for risky borrowers. 
 Mr. Mishkin's paper also included a conclusion that investors may not be happy to hear:
 ''Making sure that a house-price collapse does not do serious harm to the aggregate economy in no way eliminates sharp declines in house prices and so does not provide insurance against such declines,'' he wrote.
 ''The same reasoning holds true for stock prices. Indeed, we have seen substantial declines in housing and other asset prices in many countries even when monetary policy has been eased substantially.''

HEADLINE: Credit Turmoil Bruised Most on Wall Street, but Pain Was Not Shared Equally

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
There was gloom but not doom. 
 Wall Street's first reports since this summer's credit storm revealed extensive damage, but better-than-expected earnings this week from four brokerage firms offered some comfort. 
 There was clear separation among the investment banks, as Goldman Sachs powered through the turmoil in the credit markets to post a 79 percent increase in profit yesterday, its third-best quarter ever. At Bear Stearns, earnings fell 61 percent on sharp losses related to its hedge funds and exposure to subprime investments. 
 Third-quarter profit was down 3 percent at Lehman Brothers and 7 percent at Morgan Stanley, which reported earlier this week, but at both companies performance was stronger than anticipated. 
 ''Is the glass one-fourth empty or three-quarters full?'' asked Michael Mayo, a Deutsche Bank brokerage analyst in New York. ''We still think it is more full than empty. It is one more case where the brokers showed their resiliency through a difficult market.'' 
 At all the firms, the United States fixed-income operations experienced heavy losses from mortgage-related securities and write-downs of the value of leveraged loans. Bank-run hedge funds, including Goldman's Global Alpha Fund and two Bear Stearns funds focused on the credit markets, also struggled. But other units picked up some of the slack with stronger results in equities and commodities trading, investment banking fees, and other activities outside the United States.
 Wall Street analysts said geography was a crucial differentiator. All but Bear Stearns derive more than half their revenue from outside the United States. But trading results perhaps told the story best. 
 Analysts said Bear Stearns's trading revenue was down 89 percent from the previous quarter. At Morgan Stanley, it was down 53 percent; at Lehman, 44 percent. Goldman, however, posted a gain in trading revenue of 46 percent. It booked a $900 million gain on the sale of Horizon Wind Energy and bet correctly that prices of mortgage-related securities would fall.
 ''Goldman must have taken the other side of everybody else's trades,'' said Brad Hintz, a brokerage analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''If you look at its results five years from now, you wouldn't be able to tell there were financial troubles.'' 
 All the banks that reported this week said they thought the worst was over. ''We are a lot closer to the bottom than we were at the second quarter,'' said David A. Viniar, Goldman Sachs's chief financial officer, during a conference call. 
 Mr. Viniar said there were early signs that the loan sales market was improving. The global economy seems healthy, he said, and the Federal Reserve's larger-than-expected cut in interest rates this week ''certainly left a better tone in all financial markets.'' 
 Still, challenges remain. Analysts said once-lucrative operations, like the sales of mortgage securities and other structured products, would be smaller going forward. Investors have turned away from complex securities like collateralized debt obligations, and subprime loan origination will be difficult to restart. Many of the firms, including Lehman, announced layoffs in their units active in those areas. 
 In addition, the steady stream of investment banking fees is likely to slow. Deal advisory fees helped buoy profit at all the major Wall Street firms this quarter. But much of the business was tied to transactions with private equity firms, which were based on deals made earlier but only recently booked. That revenue is likely to fall off in 2008. 
 ''We were driving down the highway, and we just put on the brakes,'' said Mr. Hintz, the analyst.
 Even if the financial markets are stabilizing, the underlying problems from the American housing market persist. Analysts still expect a spike in late payments and foreclosures, causing consumers to lose their homes and mortgage-related securities to go bad. That would trickle down to investment banks, placing Bear Stearns, which has the greatest orientation toward the United States and the mortgage market, at the most risk.
 That exposure was highlighted in results at Bear, which underperformed Wall Street rivals by a wide margin. Bear had net income of $171.3 million, or $1.16 a share, down from $438 million, or $3.02 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Goldman's net income was $2.85 billion, or $6.13 a share, up from $1.59 billion, or $3.26 a share.
 In fact, Goldman Sachs posted a 32 percent return on equity for the third quarter, nearly twice Morgan Stanley's and Lehman's and more than six times the 5 percent return at Bear.
 The results underscored the challenges facing James E. Cayne, Bear's chief executive, as he struggles to right the firm from what he has called the worst crisis in its 84 years.
 For years, Mr. Cayne has toyed with selling the company before he retires. But there has been no urgency; Bear had carved out a lucrative niche as a shrewd player in mortgage securities, and Mr. Cayne expected that the firm's value to a prospective bidder would only rise as small competitors sold themselves to the big banks.
 But the collapse of the firm's two hedge funds that were active in Bear's core sector has hurt the firm's image. 
 On a conference call with investors, Bear's chief financial officer, Samuel L. Molinaro Jr., said that the asset management unit's reputation had suffered but that ''we believe the fixed-income earning capacity of our franchise is intact.'' 
 More than ever, people within and outside Bear have a sense that Mr. Cayne, 73, may decide to sell sooner rather than later. Last week, he spent several days in the hospital, and he was out of the office for most of last week, executives at the firm said.
 Although he returned to work yesterday, Mr. Cayne's hospitalization is a further reminder that he is no longer a young man. Whether this results in a merger or a faster hand off to Alan D. Schwartz, Bear's president, or both, remains to be seen.

HEADLINE: Regulating Microsoft

 BODY:
Microsoft's resounding defeat in a European antitrust case establishes welcome principles that should be adopted in the United States as guideposts for the future development of the information economy. 
 The court agreed with European regulators that Microsoft had abused its operating system monopoly by incorporating its Media Player, which plays music and films, into Windows. That shut out rivals, like RealPlayer. The decision sets a sound precedent that companies may not leverage their dominance in one market (the operating system) to extend it into new ones (the player). 
 The court also agreed that Microsoft should provide rival software companies the information they need to make their products work with Microsoft's server software. That establishes the welcome principle of interoperability, which should spur innovation in the future.
 Microsoft's near-monopoly can hurt consumers in two big ways: allowing the company to charge more for its software and potentially stifling innovation by rivals, who might stay out of a market from fear of being demolished by the dominant player. Microsoft should not be allowed to use the bundling of its products to bury RealPlayer and other companies, just as it was convicted of doing to Netscape's Navigator.
 In applying these principles, of course, regulators must be careful not to stifle innovation -- including innovation by market-dominating forces like Microsoft. The principles contained in the European court decision should not be used to hamstring Microsoft and other big technology firms from simply adding features to their software, because that would harm consumers, too.
 The court's decision is likely to have a profound impact on technology industries, emboldening European regulators in antitrust fights against other companies, including Apple, over its dominance of the music download market, and Intel, over its virtual control over the microchip industry.
 The court's decision puts Europe at the cutting edge of technology regulation. Considering the global nature of the technology industry, the principles set in Europe could set the bar for products developed and sold around the world. The scrutiny of regulators appears to have already produced some positive results. Responding to complaints by Google that it would use the search box in its new version of Internet Explorer to steer users toward the MSN search engine, Microsoft made it fairly easy for consumers to choose which search engine to use with the feature.
 American regulators -- who have reacted to the European court decision as if it were a mortal blow against capitalism itself -- should embrace it as a healthy step in the growth of the information economy.

HEADLINE: Official Defends Bank of England's Response to Crisis

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

 BODY:
The governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, offered an unapologetic defense yesterday of the bank's decision to reverse course and inject cash into the financial system. He said politics was responsible for the crisis that led to the near-collapse of a large mortgage bank, Northern Rock.
 After weeks in which he had preached against rescuing investors who had made bad decisions, Mr. King told a parliamentary committee that the bank had had to walk a fine line between preserving financial stability and taking steps that could encourage reckless behavior in the future. 
 ''We have balanced the concerns about moral hazard against the concerns that arose from the beginning of this week about the strains on the banking system more generally,'' he said.
 But that was not enough to spare Mr. King, whose five-year term at the central bank expires in June, from sometimes sharp questions from angry lawmakers.
 ''Were you on the job?'' asked John McFall, the Labor member of Parliament who heads the committee. ''You're not giving us any assurances this morning that you were on the job.''
 On Wednesday, the central bank made available $:10 billion, or $19.9 billion, lent for three months, into a banking system that has been parched for cash since early August, when a spiraling credit crisis emanating from the United States mortgage market led to a drying up of liquidity.
 It also announced it would accept mortgage collateral from the banks for the loans, raising the prospect that it would effectively absorb potential losses on securities whose value is now highly questionable.
 Mr. King had previously criticized the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve for similar steps, arguing that they were creating a ''moral hazard'' by effectively bailing out banks that are starved for operating cash because of bad bets they and others made in the credit markets.
 But the cascading crisis around Northern Rock -- and Britain's first bank run in nearly 150 years -- helped turn the tide at the Bank of England.
 Much of the hearing was dominated by angry inquiries from members of Parliament as to why the bailout of Northern Rock, announced last Friday, had scared depositors into lining up to withdraw their savings, instead of calming them.
 ''How do we get into a situation where the effort put in to rescue Northern Rock is the equivalent of screaming fire in a crowded cinema?'' Mr. McFall asked. ''Everybody rushes for the door as a result of one company having a bad business model.''
 Mr. King sought to spread the blame to the government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who was the chancellor of the Exchequer under Tony Blair until just a few months ago.
 Mr. King said that the bank had to respect British and European Union legislation that had the unintended effect of foreclosing certain solutions that would have been applied in the past.
 For example, one option would have been to orchestrate a takeover of Northern Rock over a weekend, so that depositors woke up on Monday to find themselves customers of a much stronger bank. But takeover regulations have made such speedy transaction impossible.
 Another would have been a covert infusion of money to Northern Rock, but legal advisers concluded that the European Union's market abuse directive, aimed at keeping shareholders apprised of important information, apparently prevented that.
 Mr. King also criticized the British deposit insurance system, saying it offered too little protection to stop the run on Northern Rock. But he defended the response, which mixed a loan from the Bank of England with a deposit guarantee from the government two days later, as a reasonable response to the crisis.
 When Northern Rock's mortgages and mortgage-related securities were unable to be sold because of tight credit markets, the central bank had to act, he said.

HEADLINE: Generics: An Inflation Therapy

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL

 BODY:
As overall health care costs continue to rise sharply, prescription drugs have emerged as a surprising exception. 
 Annual inflation in drug costs is at the lowest rate in the three decades since the Labor Department began using its current method of tracking prescription prices. The rate over the last 12 months is 1 percent, according to the government's latest data, released Wednesday.
 ''The way the index is going, it looks like drug price increases are not going to be very painful this year,'' said Daniel H. Ginsburg, a supervisory economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, where he is involved in compiling the Consumer Price Index. 
 As recently as 2005, inflation in drug prices was running at an annual rate of 4.4 percent. 
 Economists say the slowdown has come about because more people are turning to generics and because generic versions of some of the most common drugs have recently come on the market. 
 In the past year and a half alone, generic equivalents have become available for the cholesterol treatment Zocor, the sleeping pill Ambien and the blood pressure drug Norvasc. 
 Another factor could be the so-called Wal-Mart effect. Last fall, Wal-Mart began offering many generic prescriptions at $4 a month. Target quickly announced a similar plan, and Kmart expanded its program, which offers a 90-day supply of generic drugs for $15. Other retailers have followed with their variations. Publix, a grocery store chain with 684 pharmacies in five states in the Southeast, announced last month that it would not charge for prescriptions for seven commonly used antibiotics. 
 To be sure, the government still expects spending on medications to rise, to nearly $500 billion a year within a decade, up from an estimated $275 billion this year. That will happen as more people take more drugs and as new drugs are introduced. Also, costs are likely to soar in some specialized categories like cancer treatments and biotechnology drugs. 
 And yet for the average household, the drug index is perhaps a better reflection of the actual day-to-day impact of prices for their most commonly used drugs, like antibiotics, blood pressure pills and cholesterol medicines. According to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, in 2006 the average brand-name prescription cost more than three times the average generic: $111, compared with $32. 
 But now, tamer drug inflation could add credibility to the platforms of presidential candidates who have embraced generics as part of a solution to rising health care costs, according to Dr. Robert Berenson, an M.D. who is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Three Democratic candidates -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, John Edwards and Barack Obama -- have included generics in their health care proposals. 
 Generics made up 63 percent of prescriptions dispensed in the United States in 2006, up 13 percent from 2005. And these days, the country's biggest supplier of prescription drugs, as measured by prescriptions filled, is not a high-profile American company like Pfizer or Merck. It is Teva Pharmaceutical, a generic manufacturer based in Israel, according to data from IMS Health, a firm that tracks the market.
 A Labor Department economist, Francisco Velez, said his office noted a drop in generic drug prices shortly after the large stores' promotions began, particularly in the South, where Wal-Mart started its program. His colleague, Mr. Ginsburg, called the drop in prices for generic drugs ''dramatic.'' Wal-Mart and other large chain stores make up 15 to 20 percent of the pharmacies that the government surveys for the index.
 The fourth quarter of 2006 was the first time in several decades that the index registered three consecutive months in which prices declined. Mr. Ginsburg said that the effect of the promotions by large retailers could be a one-time phenomenon, unless the companies decide to expand the number of drugs they discount.
 Wal-Mart's list of discounted generics includes fewer than 350 drugs. On Tuesday, Wal-Mart announced that, beginning next year, 2,400 generics would be available to its employees at $4 a month. The company has also indicated that later this month it may make an announcement regarding its generic drug program for consumers. 
 The use of generics has been promoted by Medicare, private employers and the pharmacy benefit managers that administer employee drug plans. Len Nichols, director of health policy for the New America Foundation, a Washington policy group, noted that many pharmacy benefit managers have encouraged the trend with tiered co-payments, allowing consumers to pay less if they choose the cheapest generic drugs and more for the most expensive name brands. 
 ''My guess is that the increasing market share of generics, driven largely by firms using two- and three-tier pricing -- that's what's slowing us down over time,'' Mr. Nichols said. 
 Although the Consumer Price Index is only one measure of prescription drug inflation, Medicare has also reported slower increases in spending on prescriptions, beginning in 2003 and continuing through 2005. The 2006 numbers are not yet available. 
 Despite the slowed inflation recorded by the index, overall spending for pharmaceuticals is still on the rise, up 8.3 percent in 2006, according to IMS. And that is unlikely to diminish anytime soon, as an aging population faces increasing health problems. According to Medicare, there have been great increases in the use of drugs for the cardiovascular and central nervous systems and for Type 2 diabetes. 
 High prices for new cancer drugs are also driving up spending, and pharmaceutical companies are collecting healthy profits. But John C. Rother, the policy director for AARP, said there were signs that even as brand-name manufacturers have posted higher prices for their top drugs, they have offered bigger rebates to major customers like pharmacy benefit managers. Because those rebates are negotiated individually and privately, they are difficult to measure. 
 ''For specific drugs that are near the end of their patent life, the manufacturers are trying to think about how to hang on to sales,'' Mr. Rother said. ''The only way they can do that is to offer deeper rebates so there isn't as much interest in generics.'' 
 Though the role of the so-called Wal-Mart effect in the slowing of drug cost inflation is debated, a similar phenomenon has been documented on retail prices for other items. In a recent paper, two economists, Emek Basker of the University of Missouri and Michael D. Noel of the University of California, San Diego, described how the arrival of a Wal-Mart Supercenter results in a drop in grocery prices of 1 to 1.2 percent throughout the community. 
 Wal-Mart constitutes 5 to 6 percent of annual retail spending on pharmaceuticals, according to Adam J. Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting, which focuses on the drug supply chain. 
 Mr. Fein said Wal-Mart's promotion had been beneficial not only to people without insurance but also to Wal-Mart itself, increasing traffic in the retailer's pharmacies, which he said had been underused. ''In the first two months of this program, the average Wal-Mart pharmacy's daily volume increased by about 22 percent,'' he said. ''That translated to about 30 prescriptions a day.'' 
 One customer who was drawn to Wal-Mart by the generic promotion is Bernadine Peterson, a nurse who lives in Westbury, N.Y. Ms. Peterson said she started using the Wal-Mart pharmacy four or five months ago because of the $4 generics. As a result, she said, she was saving $100 a month, reducing her monthly prescription bill to $200.
 But the number of factors limiting inflation for prescriptions makes it unclear what effect Wal-Mart's prices have. Several health care economists and financial analysts said they doubted the direct influence of drug plans at stores like Wal-Mart in slowing the inflationary trend. They noted that because the generics offered under the plans were typically the most established, and cheapest, ones, a price of $4 a month did not represent a large discount. 
 But Wal-Mart's initiative could be having a less direct effect, according to Sharon Treat, the executive director of the National Legislative Association on Prescription Drug Prices, a coalition of state and local policy makers. Ms. Treat said that publicity about Wal-Mart's plan had raised awareness of generics. 
 ''I think it may be having a spillover effect psychologically,'' Ms. Treat said. ''Folks are seeing generics as more acceptable than they had.''

HEADLINE: Partisan Lines Solidify as Republicans Thwart Democrats Again on an Iraq Vote

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 

 BODY:
Democrats and Republicans in the Senate continued their circular debate over the Iraq war on Thursday, with the same arguments and the same voting results. 
 A Democratic proposal that would have immediately changed the mission of American troops, required the withdrawal of all combat forces by the end of June 2008 and then cut off financing for military operations in Iraq received only 28 votes on Thursday, falling far short of the 60 needed to prevent a Republican filibuster. 
 The outcome was widely expected and followed the failure on Wednesday of the proposal that Democrats had put forward as their best chance of shifting the war strategy. 
 Even before the vote on Thursday, the Democrats began articulating the message that is likely to be their mantra for months: the Republican minority in the Senate is defying the will of a majority of Congress and a majority of Americans by blocking legislation to hasten the end of the war. 
 ''A majority of the House and a majority of the Senate want to change the direction of the war in Iraq,'' Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader, told reporters. ''We have voted accordingly on more than one occasion, in fact on many occasions. But the House having done their job, they come to the Senate and the Senate Republicans, the vast majority of them will not allow us to change the direction of the war in Iraq.'' 
 True, the Republicans said, adding that they were proud of it, though there was little gloating. President Bush, at his news conference, did not even mention the Republican success on Wednesday in blocking a proposal by Senator Jim Webb, Democrat of Virginia, that Democrats said would have forced a swifter withdrawal of troops. 
 Mr. Webb's initiative received 56 votes, including 6 from Republicans, the closest Democrats have come recently to an agreement on war legislation.
 Mr. Reid, in his comments to reporters, criticized Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, for withdrawing his support for the Webb proposal. Mr. Warner, a respected voice on military affairs, had voted for the proposal in July but changed his position in response to heavy lobbying by the Pentagon. 
 Mr. Reid said Democrats had gone to great lengths to win Republican votes for the Webb plan, and in a pointed dig he said: ''I even called Larry Craig, trying to get some votes. We only needed three, and we worked hard to get those.'' 
 Senator Craig, Republican of Idaho, pleaded guilty in connection with his arrest in a sex sting in a Minneapolis airport bathroom and had been absent from Washington until this week. He voted against taking up the Webb amendment on Wednesday. 
 Senator Russ Feingold, a Democrat of Wisconsin who sponsored the proposal that failed Thursday, issued a statement criticizing the Republicans even though 20 of his fellow Democrats also voted against him. 
 ''Once again the majority of Democrats supported ending the president's flawed Iraq policy,'' Mr. Feingold said in the statement. ''The time to safely redeploy our troops from Iraq is now.'' 
 The debate in the Senate on Thursday was punctuated by a Republican measure criticizing MoveOn.org, the liberal antiwar group, because of an advertisement it purchased last week attacking Gen. David H. Petraeus, the commander in Iraq. 
 There was also an outcry by some senators in both parties over Mr. Bush's threat to veto a children's health insurance bill.
 But otherwise, the Iraq war continued to dominate the speeches and votes on the floor. Debate began Thursday afternoon on another Democratic proposal, setting a deadline for the withdrawal of troops, by Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. 
 In one speech, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, seemed to sum up his party's resolve, praising General Petraeus for what he described as greatly improved conditions in Iraq. 
 ''It's in our national security interest to allow General Petraeus to continue a strategy that is bringing about better security than we've ever seen before,'' Mr. Graham said. ''Now is not the time to pull back. Now is the time to recommit American forces, political, military and economic power to finish the job that has been started.'' 
 That proposal was expected to come up for a vote on Friday, with no doubt about the outcome. Republicans stood ready to block the measure, and Democrats ready to criticize them for it.

HEADLINE: Accord Seen On Revising Loan Rules

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, bracing for a tidal wave of home foreclosures by people with subprime mortgages, is softening its opposition to Democratic proposals to expand the giant government-sponsored mortgage finance companies.
 In a chilling assessment on Thursday, Alphonso Jackson, the secretary of housing and urban development, told the House Financial Services Committee that about 500,000 homeowners -- one-quarter of the two million who have subprime mortgages scheduled to reset to higher interest rates over the next 18 months -- were likely to lose their houses.
 One central proposal by House and Senate Democrats would allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which guarantee conventional mortgages of up to $417,000, to buy and hold many billions of dollars' worth of additional mortgages in their own portfolios. 
 Supporters say the move could help many people replace their expensive subprime loans with cheaper fixed-rate loans that are guaranteed by Fannie or Freddie. 
 The Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have both staunchly opposed that idea, arguing that the companies enjoy implied backing from the federal government, and if their investments soured taxpayers would face a major risk. But Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said on Thursday that the differences had narrowed.
 ''I believe there's a good deal of agreement between us and the administration on much of this,'' Mr. Frank said at a hearing with Mr. Jackson, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., and Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
 Mr. Paulson insisted that it would be irresponsible to expand the role of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae without putting them under a strong independent regulator. But he quickly praised the House for passing a bill that ''goes a long way'' toward that goal.
 At the moment, the companies each hold about $700 billion in home mortgages in their own investment portfolios. They also resell billions of dollars in additional mortgages by bundling them into securities that are traded by investors around the world. 
 Mr. Paulson suggested that he might support a temporary increase in the size of mortgages that the two companies can buy and resell. They are barred by law from buying mortgages bigger than $417,000, which is smaller than the median price of homes in some urban markets.
 The biggest obstacle to a deal is the Senate, where Democratic leaders are eager to pass a housing rescue bill but say it will be difficult to muster the 60-vote majority needed for a bill to tighten the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 Mr. Frank, in a nod to the administration, declared that he would not accept a Senate bill that did not provide for a new regulator. 
 Mr. Bernanke said he remained skeptical about letting the government-sponsored companies expand their investment portfolios.
 But he said the turmoil in subprime lending had demonstrated a need for tougher restrictions on borrowers as well as lenders. In the past, the Fed and other federal regulatory agencies have been timid about restricting practices, saying they did not want to block loans that might be useful to certain low-income borrowers.
 ''The recent problems in subprime lending have underscored the need not only for better disclosure and new rules but also for more uniform enforcement in the fragmented market structure of brokers and lenders,'' he said. 
 Mr. Bernanke said that 15 percent of subprime loans were seriously delinquent in July -- that is, 90 days or more in arrears. That is triple the level of two years ago. Most experts expect both delinquency and foreclosure rates to continue climbing sharply, especially if resale prices continue to decline.
 The Fed chairman singled out several lending practices now under close scrutiny: prepayment penalties, which make it difficult for borrowers to replace a subprime loan with a more traditional mortgage; ''no doc'' loans that do not require borrowers to supply proof of their incomes; and loans with payments that seem low because they do not include escrow accounts for property taxes and insurance.

HEADLINE: FedEx Has Strong Quarter But Lowers Outlook for Year

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, 

 BODY:
The FedEx Corporation, the shipping company, said Thursday that its quarterly profit beat Wall Street's expectations but lowered its outlook for the full year, blaming the downturn in the housing market. 
 FedEx said it earned $494 million, or $1.58 a share, compared with $475 million, or $1.53 a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended Aug. 31 and was the first quarter of FedEx's fiscal year, rose 8 percent, to $9.2 billion.
 The results topped the profit of $1.54 a share and the revenue of $9.07 billion expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial, but FedEx's stock fell $2.94, to $104.57 a share.
 Looking ahead, FedEx forecast second-quarter earnings of $1.60 to $1.75 a share, below analysts' average estimate of $1.97 a share. For the full year, which ends in May, FedEx cut its forecast to $6.70 to $7.10 a share, from $7 to $7.40 a share.
 Analysts currently predict profit of $7.19 a share for the full year.
 The company predicted a slow second quarter in part on the acquisition of a freight line that is taking longer than expected to pay off as a result of the downturn in the housing market, which affects sales of durable goods.
 Fuel and legal costs also contributed to the predictions of slower second-quarter growth.
 In a conference call with analysts, FedEx's chief executive, Frederick W. Smith, said expansions in Britain and China were helping drive growth. A new route between Manchester, England, and the United States will ''increase daily capacity on the important U.K. to U.S. route by up to 50 percent,'' he said.
 In China, the company has offered domestic next-business-day shipping since May and increased the number of cities and counties where the service is offered to 30 from 19.

HEADLINE: Health Care Hopes

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
David Brooks is off today.

 BODY:
All the evidence suggests that it has finally become politically possible to give Americans what citizens of every other advanced nation already have: guaranteed health insurance. The economics of universal health care are sound, and polls show strong public support for guaranteed care. The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
 Unfortunately, there's a lot of that around. 
 True, one kind of fear seems, provisionally, to have been overcome: the timidity of Democratic politicians scarred by the failure of the original Clinton health plan.
 To see how much things have changed, consider Hillary Clinton's evolution. Just 15 months ago, The New York Times reported that ''her plans to expand coverage are tempered and incremental,'' and that ''she continues to shy from the ultimate challenge: describing what a comprehensive Democratic health care plan would look like.'' 
 Indeed, when she was asked how costs might be controlled, she demurred: ''It depends on what kind of system you're devising. And that's still not at all clear to me, what the body politic will bear.''
 But that was then.
 John Edwards broke the issue of health care reform open in February, when he proposed a smart and serious plan for universal health insurance -- and bravely announced his willingness to pay for the plan by letting some of the Bush tax cuts expire. Suddenly, universal health care went from being a distant progressive dream to something you could actually envision happening in the next administration. 
 Senator Clinton delayed a long time before coming out with her own plan -- a delay that created a lot of anxiety among health care reformers, and may, as I'll explain in a minute, be a bad omen for the future. Still, this week she did deliver a plan, and it's as strong as the Edwards plan -- because unless you get deep into the fine print, the Clinton plan basically is the Edwards plan. 
 That's not a criticism; it's much more important that a politician get health care right than that he or she score points for originality. Senator Clinton may be politically cautious, but she does understand health care economics and she knows a good thing when she sees it. 
 The Edwards and Clinton plans as well as the slightly weaker but similar Obama plan achieve universal-or-near-universal coverage through a well-thought-out combination of insurance regulation, subsidies and public-private competition. These plans may disappoint advocates of a cleaner, simpler single-payer system. But it's hard to see how Medicare for all could get through Congress any time in the near future, whereas Edwards-type plans offer a reasonable second best that you can actually envision being enacted by a Democratic Congress and signed by a Democratic president just two years from now. 
 To get there, however, would require overcoming a lot more fear.
 There won't be a serious Republican alternative. The health care plans of the leading Republican candidates, such as they are, are the same old, same old: they principally rely on tax breaks that go mainly to the well-off, but will supposedly conjure up the magic of the market. As Ezra Klein of The American Prospect cruelly but accurately puts it: ''The Republican vision is for a world in which the sick and dying get to deduct some of the cost of health insurance that they don't have -- and can't get -- on their taxes.''
 But the G.O.P. nominee, whoever he is, won't be trying to persuade the public of the merits of his own plan. Instead, he'll try to scare the dwindling fraction of Americans who still have good health insurance by claiming that the Democrats will take it away.
 The smear-and-fear campaign has already started. The Democratic plans all bear a strong resemblance to the health care plan that Mitt Romney signed into law as governor of Massachusetts, differing mainly in offering Americans additional choices. But that didn't stop Mr. Romney from denouncing the Clinton plan as ''European-style socialized medicine.'' And Fred Thompson claims that the Clinton plan denies choice -- which it actually offers in abundance -- and relies on ''punishment'' instead.
 These attacks probably won't be effective enough to prevent a Democrat from winning next year. But that won't be the end of the story: even if the Democrats take the White House and expand their Congressional majorities, the insurance and drug lobbies will try to bully them into backing down on their campaign promises. 
 That's why the long delay before Senator Clinton announced her health care plan made supporters of universal care, myself included, so nervous -- a nervousness that is not completely assuaged by the fact that she finally did deliver. It's good to know that whoever gets the Democratic nomination will run on a very good health care plan. What remains is the question of whether he or she will have the determination to turn that plan into reality.

 BODY:
Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students examine celebrity relationship trends and then examine the results of a Census Bureau study about marriage and divorce. They then participate in a fishbowl discussion and create prenuptial agreements outlining what makes a good marriage.
Author(s):
Michelle Sale, The New York Times Learning Network
Javaid Khan, Bank Street College of Education in New York City
Suggested Time Allowance: one hour
Objectives:
1. Analyze celebrity gossip magazines to begin conversations about trends in marriage and divorce.
2. Learn about new Census Bureau findings about marriage and divorce rates by reading and discussing the article "25th Anniversary Mark Elusive for Many Couples."
3. Participate in a fishbowl discussion about marriage and the recent findings of the marriage survey conducted by the Census Bureau.
4. Develop prenuptial agreements outlining what students believe would help establish and maintain a successful marriage.
Resources and Materials:
- pens/pencils.
- classroom board.
- a variety of celebrity gossip magazines, especially ones featuring news about marriage or divorce, or both (at least two per student pair).
- copies of the article "25th Anniversary Mark Elusive for Many Couples," found at (one per student).
Activities and Procedures:
1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Before class, arrange desks into pairs. Give each pair a variety of celebrity gossip magazines, paying close attention to those that highlight relationships, weddings and divorces. As students enter the room, direct them to each sit with a partner and look at the following prompt, written on the board for easier student access: "Examine the celebrity magazines in front of you to discover relationship trends. With your partner, discuss answers to the following questions:
- Based on the information in the magazines, how sacred is the commitment of marriage? Do you agree or disagree with this view?
- Why do you think it is difficult for famous people to get married and stay married?
- If a relationship is hard to maintain, is it necessarily a "bad" relationship? Why or why not?
- What is your longest relationship (either romantic or platonic)? What do you do (or what did you do) to maintain this relationship?
- Do you think teenagers are capable of true love?
After a few minutes, allow time for partners to share their findings with the class. How did answers compare? What factors led to different opinions? Why is marriage a popular institution in American culture? How many students think they will get married someday?
Marriage and commitment often plays a role in works of literature, like William Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" and "Macbeth," or Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice." How does the concept of marriage in these works compare to what is being conveyed in today's literature and media? What do you think accounts for this change?
2. As a class, read and discuss the article, "25th Anniversary Mark Elusive for Many Couples" (www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/lessons/20070921friday.html), focusing on the following questions:
a. What has happened to more than half of the people celebrating 25-year wedding anniversaries since the year 2000?
b. According to David Blankenhorn, what types of marriages are more fragile?
c. The article states that, "Among currently married women, non-Hispanic whites were the only group in which a majority had marked their 15th anniversary." What role, if any, do you think race plays in marriage and divorce rates? Explain your answer.
d. What is the proportion of all Americans who have been divorced?
e. What is your reaction to this proportion? Do you think it is too high, too low, or what you expected? Why?
f. How do the survival rates of 25-year marriages in the 1950s compare to those in the late 1970s?
g. Do you think longevity affects marital trends?
h. What role do you think marriage plays in today's society? Explain your answer.
i. Do you think marriage is a lifetime commitment? Why or why not?
3. To help students understand the statistics in the article, "25th Anniversary Mark Elusive for Many Couples," make copies of the graphic "Majority Not Having Silver Anniversaries" (at ) or project it on a classroom wall or screen. Briefly review current divorce patterns.
Then, quickly poll the class to find out the answers to these two questions: "Why do people split up? Why do people stay together?" List the most popular answers on the board. Allow students time to briefly comment on the responses.
Explain to the class that they will be participating in a "fishbowl" discussion about marriage and the recent findings of the marriage survey conducted by the Census Bureau. First, ask students to number off one to five, and then keep a list on the board of all "1's," "2's," "3's," "4's," and "5's." Ask all "1's" to sit facing one another in the middle of a circle created by the rest of the students. The students in the center are the only ones allowed to speak. If a student from the outer circle wants to add to the discussion, he or she moves to the middle of the circle, taps a participant to indicate that he or she should resume a place in the outer circle, and takes that student's place as the new person in the discussion. After discussing answers to the first statement, switch the students in the center to all "2's," and allow the same fishbowl procedure to occur. Be sure to switch topics enough times so that all students have the opportunity to be in the center of the discussion at least once. Explain that students will be completing a series of statements and discussing the answers. Statements to pose to students include (written on the board before class):
- "The difference between people who are married today and people who were married 20 years ago is ______________.
- Longer relationships usually mean more ______________.
- Divorce rates are high for young couples because ______________.
- Individualized technology like cellphones, DVRs, MP3 players, social networking Web sites, etc. affects people's relationships with others in that ______________.
- Marriage may be more of a "want" than a "need" in our society today because ______________.
- Religion affects many people's views about marriage because ______________.
- The ingredients for a good marriage are ______________."
During the last five minutes of class, ask and discuss the following questions: "What do you think is good or positive about marriage? What do you think is bad or negative about marriage?"
4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students prepare a draft of a prenuptial contract that would lay out the requirements for what, in their view, would constitute a good marriage. Include details from classroom conversations. In a future class, students share their contracts and discuss how realistic their ideas are about what they would expect from themselves and their future spouses.
Further Questions for Discussion:
- What do you think is the best reason to marry someone? The worst? Explain your answers.
- How is a marriage like a business?
- Do you think the divorce rates cited in the article have any impact on society at large? Why and how?
- Do you think the institution of marriage will someday cease to exist? Why or why not, and if so, when?
- Aside from marriage, what are some other examples of partnership?
Evaluation and Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on participation in pair and class discussions and thoughtful completion of "prenuptial agreements."
Vocabulary:
advocacy, uptick, errant, median
Extension Activities:
1. Write a letter to the editor offering an explanation for the motives behind current marriage statistics. Why are people getting divorced? How does age factor into these decisions?
2. Research songs about marriage and relationships and compile them onto a CD or playlist. For example, Stephen Stills recorded a song called "Love the One You're With" (1970) and Meatloaf has a song titled "Two Out of Three Ain't Bad" (1977). Both songs talk about being with someone who isn't exactly the perfect soul mate often suggested by the media. Create original artwork for the cover and a blurb describing the attitudes toward marriage included in this collection of songs.
3. Write an advertisement for what you believe to be the perfect wife, husband or life partner. As a warm-up, read Judy Syfer's 1971 essay "Why I Want a Wife" (at www.cwluherstory.org/why-i-want-a-wife.html).
Interdisciplinary Connections:
American History - Research two time periods analyzed for the Census Bureau study to see if historical events affected divorce rates. Write a report analyzing your findings.
Current Events - A recent hot topic in the news is whether or not gay marriage should be legally accepted. Research opinions and events related to the issue and write a position paper explaining your beliefs on this topic.
Journalism - Interview couples from various generations on the graphic. What are their opinions on why marriage statistics are changing? Write an article for the school paper.
Media Studies - Create a documentary about relationships. Consider both conventional and unconventional relationships, like engaged couples who never married, divorced people who are best friends, people who separated but never divorced, etc.
- Watch a taped performance of George Axelrod's "The Seven Year Itch" or the 1955 film version of this Broadway play. Prepare a review that focuses on what this body of work says about marriage and commitment. What stereotypes are promoted? How do themes in the play or movie compare to the Census Bureau study findings? Should people see this play or movie? Why or why not?
Teaching with The Times - Read the Vows section of the paper every week to find an interesting or fun idea for an engagement or wedding. Present your findings to the class. To order The New York Times for your classroom, click here.

HEADLINE: Let the East Bloom Again

BYLINE: By RICHARD T. McNIDER and JOHN R. CHRISTY. 
Richard T. McNider and John R. Christy are professors of atmospheric science at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

 BODY:
Huntsville, Ala.
 THE United States faces two major security challenges this century. Both involve water. 
 The increasing demand for water in the Western United States in an era of diminishing supply has put America's highly efficient agricultural system in jeopardy. At the same time, our nation's energy demands have led President Bush and Congressional leaders from both parties to call for more domestic production of biofuels like corn ethanol. Some agricultural experts fear that the country does not have enough water and land to both replace the declining agricultural production in the arid West and expand the production of biofuels. 
 There is, however, a sustainable solution: a return to using the land and water of the East, which dominated agriculture in the United States into the 20th century. 
 Until the middle of the 1900s, much of our country's food and fiber was produced east of the Mississippi River. Maine led the nation in potato production in 1940, and New York wasn't far behind. The South, including Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi, dominated cotton. Large amounts of corn were grown in almost every state for consumption by the local livestock and poultry. Regional vegetable markets, especially in the mid-Atlantic states, served the population centers of the East. 
 By 1980, Western irrigation and improvements in transportation had largely destroyed this Eastern system of agriculture. Irrigated cotton in Arizona, California and Texas displaced the cotton economy of the Deep South. Idaho and Washington became the nation's major potato producers. Corn production became more concentrated in the Midwest. 
 Through irrigation, Western farmers were spared the occasional droughts that had plagued Eastern farmers, but the specialized Western system came with a price. Water projects dried up the area's rivers. Salmon runs disappeared. Soils were poisoned from the salt in irrigated water that is left behind after evaporation. 
 Returning agricultural production to the Eastern United States under irrigation would be efficient and environmentally sound. In the West, at least three to four feet of water per acre is needed every year to produce a good crop. In the East, only a few inches of irrigated water per acre are needed, because of the region's heavier rainfall. Even in a dry year for the East, about a foot of water per acre will suffice. 
 Because of the huge size of the rivers in the East and the small amount of water required for Eastern irrigation, only a tiny fraction of the water in Eastern rivers would be needed for farming. Right now, the Tennessee River, with twice the natural flow of the Colorado River, has less than 1 percent of its water consumed for all uses, while the Colorado is just a memory when it reaches Mexico.
 Even if irrigation in the East were significantly expanded, the region's rivers would not be as depleted as the West's. Three percent of the Alabama River would support one million irrigated acres, compared with the nearly 30 percent of the Colorado River that is needed to irrigate a similar area. 
 In most years, the amount of water withdrawn and stored in the East would be imperceptible. Unlike the West, which requires gigantic reservoirs that take billions of dollars to build and years to fill, in the East water can be stored in inexpensive, off-stream storage ponds that do not require the damming of rivers.
 Because of the wetter climate, irrigation in the East will not produce the water quantity or salt poisoning problems found in the West. But there are obstacles peculiar to the East that will need to be addressed. Heavy rains can erode tilled soils. The use of no-till farming in an irrigated setting, however, can preserve soil moisture and prevent erosion. 
 Runoff of fertilizer and chemicals can also be a problem. But with irrigation, fertilizer can be watered into the roots of crops before a big rain, which will reduce runoff.
 And although the annual average stream flows in the East are large, they fall to critically low levels during the summer. Water for irrigation needs to be withdrawn during the winter, when billions of gallons run to the sea.
 The East can help answer the challenge of increasing bioenergy and replacing food production in the face of declining agriculture in the West. But to realize the region's potential, the federal government will need to provide money to help farmers build storage ponds to catch winter water. Without a government role, Eastern farmers may decide instead to forgo storage ponds and irrigate on-demand from low-flow summer streams or from ground water. Neither strategy is sustainable or good for the environment. 
 The East cannot and should not simply replace Western agriculture, but the East should be prepared to pick up the slack as Western farmers lose water to urban pressures and environmental concerns. To remain profitable in the face of reduced water, farmers in the West will most likely gravitate from rice and cotton to high-value crops, like winter lettuce, almonds and avocados, that fill seasonal niches.
 Based on an analysis of tree rings, the 20th century was the wettest century on record in parts of the West. Eastern vegetables may not be as perfect as those grown under irrigation in a desert, but if the West returns to a drier climate, imperfect vegetables will look good indeed. 
 If the United States does not expand agriculture in the East, the nation's food production will move offshore, to developing countries that may not manage herbicides, pesticides and health safety as well as our country does. 
 By moving more of its agriculture into the East, the United States can show the world that irrigation can be done sustainably, by irrigating where water is plentiful.

HEADLINE: Debating American Serfdom

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL

 BODY:
ANDREW SULLIVAN, a senior editor at The Atlantic, came upon a chart at TheAgitator.com last week showing two trend lines: the ranks of private workers decreasing and the number of government beneficiaries increasing in the United States since 1950, with beneficiaries now surpassing workers. The only comment from Mr. Sullivan on his blog at TheAtlantic.com was his headline: ''The Road to Serfdom.''
 Radley Balko, the libertarian commentator and journalist who writes TheAgitator.com, credits the chart to A. Gary Shilling's financial newsletter Insight. It was also posted on the Web site of Reason magazine, where Mr. Balko is an editor (reason.com). 
 According to Katherine Mangu-Ward, an editor at Reason, Mr. Shilling, an economist and columnist for Forbes, totaled up government workers, ''private-sector workers who owe their jobs to government'' and recipients of government entitlements like Social Security and food stamps. For good measure, he threw in dependents of these beneficiaries. ''Shilling found that for each person earning his pay in the private sector and paying taxes,'' Ms. Mangu-Ward wrote, ''there is at least one more person relying on a check from the government.'' 
 ''Perhaps,'' Mr. Balko mused, ''someone on the left (or for that matter, the right -- since they've mostly been in charge of the government the last six years) can explain why having more than half the country's income dependent on the government (and rising) is in any way a healthy development.''
 On his own blog at TheAtlantic.com, Matthew Yglesias, an associate editor at The Atlantic, offered what he said was ''obviously an incomplete answer,'' in the form of a question of his own. Did Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Balko, he wondered, ''really look at changes in American society between 1950 and 2007 and feel that this is a story of creeping serfdom and enslavement?''
 He went on: ''I see a population that's a lot healthier, longer-lived, and better educated than the one of 1950; a population where radically fewer people suffer from severe economic deprivation in absolute terms even as millions of impoverished people from around the world have moved to our shores.''
 A commenter on Mr. Yglesias's blog, identified as Dan the Man, also had a question. Do Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Balko ''support eliminating the Department of Defense since it's the biggest department by far?''
 COLORIZING Do movie posters do much to fill theater seats? Armin Vit, a graphic designer, believes they may. Many of the top films have had dark-hued posters. It is, he wrote on Under Consideration, a Web site for graphic designers, ''telling that black is the color of choice in movie posters.'' In his review of posters for popular films, the only exceptions were G-rated films (underconsideration.com).
 7 OTHER WONDERS CIO magazine presents a look at the ''Seven Wonders of the I.T. World,'' which are ''the biggest, most extreme and most unusual computers and projects.'' They include the fastest supercomputer (IBM Blue Gene), the ''most intriguing data center (Google's ''ultramysterious'' facility in The Dalles, Ore.) and the computer farthest from Earth (NASA's Voyager I satellite) (cio.com).
 POISONOUS MARKETING The famed British retailer Harrods hired an Egyptian cobra last week to guard a pair of gem-encrusted Rene Caovilla sandals valued at about $120,000. ''Security experts were divided on how effective the cobra would be as a deterrent to thieves,'' wrote Robert Gale on the blog A Welsh View (xo.typepad.com). But, he added, ''it made an ideal photo opportunity for the flagship store in London's Knightsbridge.''DAN MITCHELL

HEADLINE: Currency Parity Brings Canadian Shoppers South

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY and KATIE ZEZIMA; William Yardley reported from Blaine, Wash., and Katie Zezima from Boston. David Staba contributed from Niagara Falls, N.Y.

DATELINE: BLAINE, Wash., Sept. 21 

 BODY:
Tracey Carle checked the Web on Friday morning to see the wait times at the border and then bolted to the United States to shop. 
 Ms. Carle left her home in the border town of Surrey, British Columbia, cruised through the increasingly tight border here in a relatively breezy 34 minutes, stopped immediately to gas up her sport utility vehicle on the cheap at the U.S.A. Mini Mart and shot down Interstate 5 toward her real target, Target.
 ''Anytime in the last few years it's been better,'' said Ms. Carle, 49, explaining that she has long crossed the border for bargains. ''But now, this is just whoo-hoo!'' 
 The whoo-hoo part, as Ms. Carle and countless other Canadians have demonstrated recently, is tied directly to the steady rise of the Canadian dollar against its American counterpart in recent years, becoming its economic equal this week for the first time in three decades.
 On either side of the border, a buck is now a buck, or as Canadians call it on their side, a loonie. Coupled with high prices and high taxes for many things in Canada, the strength of the Canadian dollar is driving Canadians into the United States to shop for shoes, school supplies, gasoline, used cars and second homes.
 ''It's huge,'' said Jessica Smith, a stockbroker who lives near Toronto and spent the day shopping with a friend in nearby Niagara Falls, N.Y. ''But for my clients with investments in the U.S., it wipes them out.''
 Sure enough, not everyone is giddy. The weakness of the American dollar worries some Canadian investors as well as businesses that rely on American customers. It is also not helping American tourism in Canada, where the number of visitors from the United States has been declining since before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
 The rush to cross into the United States is complicated by new restrictions at the border, where proof of nationality is increasingly expected and passports are set to become mandatory as early as January. Here at the busy crossing in Blaine, the border is likely to be even more clogged because of construction to expand the number of lanes in preparation for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia.
 ''We're looking at a flood, but the dam is the border, and it's tough getting everything through that border,'' said Mike Kent, a real estate agent in Birch Bay, an area south of Blaine where Mr. Kent said Canadians had been buying property that looks at the pricier hills of their homeland.
 ''In a perfect world, the dollar would have gone par when the border was finished,'' Mr. Kent said. ''It's come at exactly the wrong time.''
 Still, Mr. Kent and others in real estate and retail on the United States side of the border are pleased by the turnaround. Five years ago, the Canadian dollar was worth just more than 60 cents in American money.
 ''They were always reminding you of how much it cost them,'' Debbie Morley, the manager at West Marine Express, a boat supply store in Blaine, said of Canadian shoppers, who provide 60 percent to 70 percent of the store's business. ''Now they're just so happy. They say, 'I can buy more!' ''
 Experts emphasize that the shifts in the border economy have not occurred overnight, that the loonie has been inching toward equality for several years. Some Canadians said Friday that they had shopped in the United States even when the Canadian dollar was weak, because of better prices.
 Hart Hodges, director of the Center for Economic and Business Research at Western Washington University, noted that while the number of Canadians coming across the border has been increasing in recent months, the numbers remain far lower than they were before the border became tighter. He also said that many major American retailers had opened stores in Canada since the last time the Canadian dollar was strong, in the early 1990s, and that Canadians who shopped south were now often seeking specific items like electronics or specials at Target and Nordstrom.
 Yet the idea of ''parity'' in the two currencies has added momentum to make the crossing. ''Everybody's talking about it at work,'' said Ms. Carle.
 In Vermont, Buzz Roy, owner of Brown's Drugstore in Derby Line, said of his Canadian customers: ''They don't buy anything in particular, but everything in general. We've seen a gradual increase over the summer, and we've seen a bigger increase this week.'' 
 Mr. Roy said more customers would make trips if it were easier to cross the border, ''but they're still coming in droves.''
 In North Dakota, Crystal Schlecht, who works for the City of Cavalier, said the arts and crafts show in town last weekend had a surprisingly international feel in spite of the slow-go at the border crossing.
 ''I'd say 60 percent of the people the whole weekend were from Canada,'' she said. ''And we've never really had that before.''

HEADLINE: As the World Comes to Georgia, an Old Church Adapts

BYLINE: By WARREN ST. JOHN

DATELINE: CLARKSTON, Ga., Sept. 21 

 BODY:
When the Rev. Phil Kitchin steps into the pulpit of the Clarkston International Bible Church on Sunday mornings, he stands eye to eye with the changing face of America. In the pews before him, alongside white-haired Southern women in their Sunday best, sit immigrants from the Philippines and Togo, refugees from war-scarred Liberia, Ethiopia and Sudan, even a convert from Afghanistan. 
 ''Jesus said heaven is a place for people of all nations,'' Mr. Kitchin likes to say. ''So if you don't like Clarkston, you won't like heaven.''
 The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once noted that 11 a.m. on Sunday was the beginning of the most segregated hour of the week in America, and for the better part of 120 years, that certainly applied to this church. From 1883 until a few years ago, anyone on the pulpit would have gazed out at a congregation that was exclusively white. The church is a member of the Southern Baptist Convention, a group that in 1995 renounced its racist past. 
 But an influx of immigrants and refugees transformed this town in a little over a decade, and in the process sparked a battle within this church over its identity and its faithfulness to the Bible, one that led it to change not just its name but its mission.
 The Clarkston International Bible Church, which sits along an active freight rail line down the road from the former Ku Klux Klan bastion of Stone Mountain, is now home to parishioners from more than 15 countries. The church also houses congregations of Ethiopians, Sudanese, Liberians and French West Africans who worship separately, according to their own traditions. The church's Sunday potluck lunch features African stews and Asian vegetable dishes alongside hot dogs, sweet tea and homemade cherry pie.
 The transformation of what was long known as the Clarkston Baptist Church speaks to a broader change among other American churches. Many evangelical Christians who have long believed in spreading their religion in faraway lands have found that immigrants offer an opportunity for church work within one's own community. And many immigrants and refugees are drawn by the warm welcome they get from the parishioners, which can stand in stark contrast to the more competitive and alienating nature of workaday America.
 Indeed, evangelical churches have begun to stand out as rare centers of ethnic mixing in a country that researchers say has become more culturally fragmented, in part because of immigration.
 A recent study by the Harvard political scientist Robert D. Putnam underscored the practical complications of diversity. In interviews with 30,000 Americans, the study found that residents of more diverse communities ''tend to withdraw from collective life,'' voting less and volunteering less than those in more homogeneous communities.
 The study noted a conspicuous exception.
 ''In many large evangelical congregations,'' the researchers wrote, ''the participants constituted the largest thoroughly integrated gatherings we have ever witnessed.''
 Change Comes to Town
 Diversity came to Clarkston like a bolt from the blue. The community, just east of the Atlanta Beltway and 11 miles from downtown, was settled by white farmers and railroad workers in the late 1800s.
 Clarkston remained rural and mostly white until the 1970s, when developers began to build apartment complexes for middle-class workers drawn to Atlanta after the international airport here opened. In the next decade, many of those workers began to move to new suburbs farther from town. Vacancies increased, rents fell and crime rose.
 In the 1990s, aid agencies that contract with the federal government to resettle refugees pegged Clarkston as the perfect place for these vulnerable newcomers. The town had cheap housing: those empty apartments. It had public transportation -- few refugees could afford cars. And Clarkston was within commuting distance of downtown Atlanta's booming economy.
 From 1996 to 2001, more than 19,000 refugees were resettled in Georgia, many in Clarkston or surrounding DeKalb County.
 The change to Clarkston was profound. The schools became crowded with children who spoke little English. Locals learned not to drive down Indian Creek Drive on Friday afternoons because of traffic from Friday prayers at the mosque. A third to a half of Clarkston's 7,100 residents are now foreign-born, most of them refugees. 
 Some older residents left town, alienated and concerned over the quality of education at the overburdened schools. 
 Many of those families had attended the Clarkston Baptist Church, leaving empty pews. By the end of the decade the church had canceled one of its two Sunday services. The congregation had dwindled to fewer than 100 from 600.
 Concerned about its survival, the church commissioned a study that found blacks and immigrants would soon outnumber whites in the area. William S. Perrin, 75 and a member of the church since 1948, said that at one meeting on the issue, a deacon stood up to express his anger.
 ''If you think black folks are going to come in here and take our church away from us,'' Mr. Perrin remembers the man saying, ''you got another thing coming.''
 Reaching Out
 William Perrin was no stranger to such attitudes. A retired Army lieutenant colonel who survived a midair collision over Vietnam, he grew up in Clarkston before the civil rights era. Some old ideas about race were embedded in his own psyche. 
 He recalled that while in the Army he once used a racial epithet in front of a black pilot he admired. When he realized what he had done, Mr. Perrin said, he broke down, hugged the pilot and begged for forgiveness.
 ''I'm ashamed of myself,'' he said he told the man. ''That's just my white upbringing in Georgia.'' 
 The pilot forgave Mr. Perrin, who then vowed never to disrespect another person because of race or ethnicity.
 With his church failing, Mr. Perrin and other longtime members looked to the Scriptures for guidance and found what they believed was a mandate from Jesus to diversify their church. 
 ''We realized that what the Lord had in store for that old Clarkston Baptist Church was to transition into a truly international church and to help minister to all these ethnic groups moving into the county,'' Mr. Perrin said.
 To offset costs during the lean years, the Clarkston Baptist Church had leased space to congregations of Filipinos, Vietnamese and Africans for their own services. Mr. Perrin and other members of the church proposed that they invite these congregations to join them as a single multiethnic church.
 While an outspoken advocate for diversity within his church, Mr. Perrin is quick to point out that he is no liberal. He voted twice for President Bush. Mr. Perrin said he advocated for an international church because the Bible told him to.
 That view is growing more common among conservative Christians, said Mark DeYmaz, a leading proponent of multicultural churches and the pastor of the Mosaic Church of Central Arkansas, in Little Rock, a congregation of 700 from some 30 countries.
 In the Book of John, Mr. DeYmaz points out, Jesus is portrayed after the Last Supper as praying for unity among his followers, a message he said runs counter to the notion of an ethnically homogeneous church.
 The idea of combining their old Baptist church with congregations of Filipinos and Africans appalled some older white members of the Clarkston Baptist Church, who feared giving up their ways of worship. Some threatened to leave.
 ''They struggled,'' said Allen Hill, the pastor at the time and now an official with the Georgia Baptist Convention. ''It's something Southern Baptists have to struggle with more than others because of our history.''
 That history stretches back to 1845, when the Southern Baptist Convention was formed by a group that seceded from a larger national Baptist organization after that group decreed it would not appoint slaveholders as missionaries. 
 In 1995, the Southern Baptist Convention apologized for its failure to support civil rights and for its congregations that ''intentionally and/or unintentionally'' excluded blacks. To this day, the overwhelming majority of its members are white, said Michael O. Emerson, a professor of sociology at Rice University who has studied the group.
 In 2004, the Clarkston Baptist Church adopted the changes proposed by elders like Mr. Perrin, and merged with the Filipino and Nigerian congregations. 
 They renamed their church the Clarkston International Bible Church. 
 That change was too much for many of the older members, like Brenda and Robert White. They left after more than 20 years as members.
 ''I really resented that,'' Mrs. White said of the name change. ''I know it's the 21st century and we have to change and do things differently. But I don't think it's fair that we had to cater to the foreign people rather than them trying to change to our way of doing things.''
 ''It just wasn't Baptist church anymore,'' she said. 
 A New Church Thrives
 Rosa Paige, a 79-year-old Alabama native and member of the church for 46 years, winced and put her fingers in her ears. The staid Baptist hymns of her old church have been replaced by ''praise music,'' contemporary Christian songs, played by teenagers on electric guitars, that church leaders thought would appeal to new congregants.
 ''It's a little loud for me sometimes,'' Mrs. Paige said.
 Merging congregations has meant compromise for everyone. The immigrants who join the main congregation have to give up worshiping in their native languages. Older Southern Baptist parishioners have given up traditional hymns and organ music.
 Other areas, like the potluck lunch in the gym every Sunday, have required little adjustment. ''Everybody likes everybody else's food,'' Mr. Perrin said.
 The pastor, Mr. Kitchin, a North Carolina native, joined the church in 2006 and learned quickly to keep his sermons simple because so many in his new congregation were just learning English.
 ''I'd say, 'You can take it to the bank,' and nobody had a clue what I was talking about,'' he said in a thick drawl. 
 Mr. Kitchin described his job as part minister, part cultural translator. Church members seek his advice and help.
 Recently, Mr. Kitchin said, a Liberian refugee asked him to sponsor a child's visa so the man's family could be reunited. Mr. Kitchin declined.
 ''If I do it for him, I have to do it for everyone in the church who wants their children to come in,'' he said. ''To tell this man no rips your heart out.''
 There are other problems beyond the church's front doors. Not everyone in the community has appreciated the church's efforts to proselytize among Clarkston's newcomers. Salahadin Wazir, the imam at al-Momineen mosque here, said he frequently heard from Muslim refugees and immigrants who say they attended a community outreach program administered by the church where conversation quickly turned to the teachings of Jesus.
 ''It's inappropriate,'' Mr. Wazir said. ''Playing on the minds of small children or desperate, needy people -- that's not the way to preach.''
 Mr. Kitchin said he heard such complaints frequently, but he does not apologize.
 ''I'm a believer in Jesus Christ, and I am commanded by him to go and tell everybody who he is,'' he said. ''And because we're in a free country you have the freedom to choose.''
 ''How can you choose if you don't know what's available?'' 
 Despite those tensions, Mr. Kitchin's church is now thriving. The congregation has grown to more than 300 from 100 a few years ago, and the 10:45 a.m. service on Sundays, which Mr. Kitchin leads, is well attended.
 Ultimately, Mr. Kitchin hopes, the groups who worship separately will join the larger congregation as the Filipino and Nigerian congregations did; many of the youngest members, who prefer church in English, already have. 
 But those congregations face the same tough choices as did the old white Baptist church. Some have been torn between a desire to assimilate and a fear of giving up their own identities.
 That is the case with the Liberian congregation led by the Rev. Peter Nehsahn. His flock had considered joining the larger group but decided against it for now, for fear of losing elements of their worship style, which includes drumming and singing African hymns.
 ''Our people might get lost in the mix,'' Mr. Nehsahn said.
 But even worshiping separately within the church gives some of the newcomers a sense of connection to the Clarkston community they would not get if they worshiped alone.
 For many of those who have joined the main congregation, the experience has been life changing. Marcelle Bess, a white American and a lifelong member of the church, said two of her daughters were dating young Filipino men they had met through the church. She hopes they will marry, she said.
 Mr. Perrin said the impact of the church on his life hit him when he and his wife were traveling through the Midwest. They stopped to worship at whatever Baptist church they could find.
 ''Every church that we walked into was pure white Caucasian,'' he said. ''My wife and I really felt uncomfortable, because, we realized, here in Clarkston is what the world is all about.''
 Mr. Kitchin thinks that in the not-so-distant future many more American churches will face the sort of questions his church has. He said he was frequently asked for advice.
 ''I tell people, 'America is changing,' '' he said. '' 'Get over it.' ''

HEADLINE: Let the East Bloom Again

BYLINE: By RICHARD T. McNIDER and JOHN R. CHRISTY. 
Richard T. McNider and John R. Christy are professors of atmospheric science at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

 BODY:
Huntsville, Ala.
 THE United States faces two major security challenges this century. Both involve water. 
 The increasing demand for water in the Western United States in an era of diminishing supply has put America's highly efficient agricultural system in jeopardy. At the same time, our nation's energy demands have led President Bush and Congressional leaders from both parties to call for more domestic production of biofuels like corn ethanol. Some agricultural experts fear that the country does not have enough water and land to both replace the declining agricultural production in the arid West and expand the production of biofuels. 
 There is, however, a sustainable solution: a return to using the land and water of the East, which dominated agriculture in the United States into the 20th century. 
 Until the middle of the 1900s, much of our country's food and fiber was produced east of the Mississippi River. Maine led the nation in potato production in 1940, and New York wasn't far behind. The South, including Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi, dominated cotton. Large amounts of corn were grown in almost every state for consumption by the local livestock and poultry. Regional vegetable markets, especially in the mid-Atlantic states, served the population centers of the East. 
 By 1980, Western irrigation and improvements in transportation had largely destroyed this Eastern system of agriculture. Irrigated cotton in Arizona, California and Texas displaced the cotton economy of the Deep South. Idaho and Washington became the nation's major potato producers. Corn production became more concentrated in the Midwest. 
 Through irrigation, Western farmers were spared the occasional droughts that had plagued Eastern farmers, but the specialized Western system came with a price. Water projects dried up the area's rivers. Salmon runs disappeared. Soils were poisoned from the salt in irrigated water that is left behind after evaporation. 
 Returning agricultural production to the Eastern United States under irrigation would be efficient and environmentally sound. In the West, at least three to four feet of water per acre is needed every year to produce a good crop. In the East, only a few inches of irrigated water per acre are needed, because of the region's heavier rainfall. Even in a dry year for the East, about a foot of water per acre will suffice. 
 Because of the huge size of the rivers in the East and the small amount of water required for Eastern irrigation, only a tiny fraction of the water in Eastern rivers would be needed for farming. Right now, the Tennessee River, with twice the natural flow of the Colorado River, has less than 1 percent of its water consumed for all uses, while the Colorado is just a memory when it reaches Mexico.
 Even if irrigation in the East were significantly expanded, the region's rivers would not be as depleted as the West's. Three percent of the Alabama River would support one million irrigated acres, compared with the nearly 30 percent of the Colorado River that is needed to irrigate a similar area. 
 In most years, the amount of water withdrawn and stored in the East would be imperceptible. Unlike the West, which requires gigantic reservoirs that take billions of dollars to build and years to fill, in the East water can be stored in inexpensive, off-stream storage ponds that do not require the damming of rivers.
 Because of the wetter climate, irrigation in the East will not produce the water quantity or salt poisoning problems found in the West. But there are obstacles peculiar to the East that will need to be addressed. Heavy rains can erode tilled soils. The use of no-till farming in an irrigated setting, however, can preserve soil moisture and prevent erosion. 
 Runoff of fertilizer and chemicals can also be a problem. But with irrigation, fertilizer can be watered into the roots of crops before a big rain, which will reduce runoff.
 And although the annual average stream flows in the East are large, they fall to critically low levels during the summer. Water for irrigation needs to be withdrawn during the winter, when billions of gallons run to the sea.
 The East can help answer the challenge of increasing bioenergy and replacing food production in the face of declining agriculture in the West. But to realize the region's potential, the federal government will need to provide money to help farmers build storage ponds to catch winter water. Without a government role, Eastern farmers may decide instead to forgo storage ponds and irrigate on-demand from low-flow summer streams or from ground water. Neither strategy is sustainable or good for the environment. 
 The East cannot and should not simply replace Western agriculture, but the East should be prepared to pick up the slack as Western farmers lose water to urban pressures and environmental concerns. To remain profitable in the face of reduced water, farmers in the West will most likely gravitate from rice and cotton to high-value crops, like winter lettuce, almonds and avocados, that fill seasonal niches.
 Based on an analysis of tree rings, the 20th century was the wettest century on record in parts of the West. Eastern vegetables may not be as perfect as those grown under irrigation in a desert, but if the West returns to a drier climate, imperfect vegetables will look good indeed. 
 If the United States does not expand agriculture in the East, the nation's food production will move offshore, to developing countries that may not manage herbicides, pesticides and health safety as well as our country does. 
 By moving more of its agriculture into the East, the United States can show the world that irrigation can be done sustainably, by irrigating where water is plentiful.

HEADLINE: Fear of European Slump As Currency Sets Record

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
Fears of an abrupt economic slowdown in Europe deepened on Friday, after the release of weaker-than-expected data and another record in the euro's relentless rise against the dollar.
 Europe's stampeding currency prompted a warning from the plane maker Airbus that it might have to cut costs more deeply than expected to restore its troubled operations to financial health.
 ''If the euro remained durably at $1.45, that would mean we have to find 1 billion euros in additional savings,'' Fabrice Bregier, the chief operating officer, said in an interview with a French radio station. The euro briefly traded at $1.41 on Friday morning before falling back slightly. It was at $1.4091 in late trading in New York. 
 Airbus, which is controlled by France and Germany, is already in the midst of a radical cost-cutting campaign, forced by heavy losses on its A380 jet. Its voice is the latest in a chorus of complaints from French and Italian leaders that the strong euro could choke off Europe's growth.
 What concerns economists more, however, is a sharp drop registered in the monthly survey of purchasing managers' activity -- evidence that the credit crisis that began in the American mortgage market and infected British and German banks has now seeped into Europe's underlying economy.
 An index of purchasing managers in the service sector dropped four points in September, its largest monthly decline ever, suggesting that commerce here is slowing faster than economists predicted.
 ''It's a bad surprise,'' said Thomas Mayer, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. ''All this talk of Europe not being really affected by the problems in the U.S. may have been whistling in the wind.''
 It is far too soon to speak of a recession in Europe, Mr. Mayer said. The European Central Bank has put off an increase in interest rates, possibly for the foreseeable future, and injected cash into the banking system to prevent the credit squeeze from mutating into a broader financial crisis.
 Still, the speed with which the turmoil in the financial markets has registered in the purchasing data alarmed economists. Most are busy scaling back their predictions for growth in Europe next year.
 ''It certainly got me nervous,'' said Erik F. Nielsen, the chief European economist at Goldman Sachs, who had already lowered his forecast for European growth in 2008 to 2 percent from 2.3 percent.
 The record-breaking rise of the euro has injected another unpredictable factor into their calculations. Most European exporters have weathered the rally without complaint, having cut costs and hedged their exposure, either financially or by moving production to countries that do not use the euro.
 But a noisy minority is starting to agitate, and political leaders, notably in France, have picked up their concerns, lobbying the European Central Bank to take steps to stem the euro's appreciation.
 ''We hope the E.C.B., at its meeting in October, will examine the consequences and take appropriate action,'' the French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, said during a visit to China on Friday.
 The European Central Bank rejects such demands as political meddling, and it has responded in increasingly testy fashion to statements made by President Nicolas Sarkozy and his ministers. 
 In a speech in Paris on Friday, one of the bank's executive board members, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, said, ''In no other country do the political authorities make frequent and uncoordinated public statements about the exchange rate.'' It hurts the credibility of Europe's monetary policy, he said.
 Economists say the level of noise in each country is roughly proportional to its exchange-rate vulnerability.
 German officials, for example, have said relatively little about the recent rally. ''There's no doubt that by any measure, the Germans are in much better position than the French,'' Mr. Nielsen said. ''On unit labor costs, Italy has also done a better job than France.''
 Still, a top Italian industrialist, Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, said, ''The super euro worries us; we don't want to give anyone any lessons, but this could become a problem for exports.''
 Airbus is particularly vulnerable because it earns all its revenue in dollars and incurs about half of its operating costs in euros. That puts it at a big disadvantage to its American rival, Boeing.
 Under its existing plan, Airbus plans to cut 2 billion euros ($2.8 billion) a year in costs by 2010, through the sale of several factories and the elimination of 10,000 jobs. In his radio interview, Mr. Bregier said the cost-cutting plan was predicated on a euro exchange rate of $1.35.
 Airbus has hedged enough of its dollar exposure that a major short-term impact is unlikely, Rainer Ohler, the head of communications, said.
 ''Our problem is what's going to happen in 2009 and 2010,'' he said. ''But nobody can predict what the dollar is going to do.''

HEADLINE: Linebacker and South Florida Make Long Commute to Success

BYLINE: By PETE THAMEL

DATELINE: BUSHNELL, Fla., Sept. 17 

 BODY:
As the morning sun burns through the last traces of predawn darkness, Ben Moffitt contorts his oversized frame into his economy car. 
 It is not long after 7 a.m. when Moffitt, a senior linebacker for the South Florida football team, hums down County Road 629 here in his itsy-bitsy Toyota Yaris. 
 It is the first leg of his 55-mile trip to Tampa. By living so far away, Moffitt has assured a more comfortable, family-oriented life for his wife and two children. But that sacrifice means a 110-mile round trip every day. He leaves as early as 3:30 a.m. for winter workouts and arrives home as late as 7 a.m. after a road game. Moffitt has driven a Kia into the ground (''It didn't scream linebacker,'' he joked of the car), has compiled about $200 in U.S.F. parking tickets and has traveled well over 100,000 miles. 
 Along the way, a country kid has evolved into one of college football's top linebackers, and a commuter university that started football 11 years ago has found a spot alongside the nation's elite. 
 ''I can't imagine what he's gone through, the sacrifices he's made,'' the defensive coordinator Wally Burnham said. ''But he's totally committed to both his family and football. He's always put his family first.''
 Family is what prompted Moffitt to move back to Bushnell after he and his wife, Shauna, lived in Tampa during his freshman season. Shauna -- with son Trevor, now 5, in tow -- drove to Bushnell every day that year so she could work as a data specialist at the Sumter County Property Appraiser's Office. 
 Shauna and Ben also returned on weekends to spend time with family and go to church. 
 ''That was a hard eight months,'' Shauna said. ''It was such a culture shock, it was so different.''
 The Moffitts missed walking into Wal-Mart and Winn-Dixie and seeing familiar faces. They decided to move back after Ben's freshman year and soon welcomed a daughter, Rylan, now 3. They rented for a while before building a house, where Ben proudly showed a visitor that he had hand-built the shed and the wooden garbage can holders. 
 Moffitt, who has helped U.S.F. grow into a power, acknowledges his most important teammate. 
 ''She's an awesome woman,'' he said of Shauna. ''She helps me so much. If I didn't have someone like her to support me, it would be hard to do what I do.''
 Moffitt, 22, began working for his stepfather's tree company when he was 8, hauling brush before graduating to chipping. He was eventually cutting limbs while being supported by a tree strap or standing in a cherry picker. When Moffitt wanted to buy a $300 hunting rifle at age 9, his stepfather made him earn the money. 
 ''Child-labor laws didn't apply to me,'' he said with a smile. ''It taught me very good life lessons, like how to work. If you want something, you have to go work for it.'' 
 Inman Sherman, who coached Moffitt at Sumter High School, said: ''Ben has always had a bullheaded determination to get done what he wanted to get done. He's never wavered.''
 Moffitt found the perfect football program and coach to match his work ethic, signing with South Florida and Coach Jim Leavitt without really looking anywhere else. 
 Leavitt's first impression of Moffitt came early on in his freshman season when U.S.F. was going through summer workouts. Moffitt had arrived out of shape, and Leavitt saw him struggling in a conditioning exercise and yelled, ''Moffitt, you're lazy.''
 Moffitt glared back at him and said confidently but politely, ''One thing I am not, Coach, is lazy.''
 Leavitt laughs at the story now. ''Ever since then, he's certainly convinced me of that,'' he said.
 No one will accuse Leavitt of being lazy either. Becoming the first head coach at South Florida, a commuter university built on a practice bombing range, in 1996 was not exactly a prototype move after being Bill Snyder's defensive coordinator at Kansas State. 
 But Leavitt's old-school, intense demeanor, which belies his youthful looks and spiky hair, has helped him build a powerhouse. Leavitt is so fiery that Moffitt recalled him once busting open his nose and bleeding profusely after head-butting a player's helmet trying to get his team fired up in pregame warm-ups. 
 ''It about knocked him out,'' Moffitt said. 
 Leavitt is known to run each set of wind sprints with the players during practice and to stay in his office well past midnight, guzzling Pepsi in 20-ounce bottles. 
 ''He's crazy,'' said the former South Florida linebacker Kawika Mitchell, now with the Giants. Mitchell recalled the U.S.F. football offices being in trailers and team meetings taking place in dormitories. U.S.F. now has a multimillion-dollar athletic facility. And a program that 11 years ago did not have a tee for the kickoff of its opening home game reached the top 25 for the first time last week. 
 ''It's amazing,'' Mitchell said. 
 Moffitt committed to U.S.F. during Mitchell's last season, 2002, when the team went 9-2 but did not reach a bowl game because it did not have conference affiliation. 
 The Bulls played in Conference USA in 2003 and 2004 before moving to the Big East in 2005. They blew out Louisville in their Big East debut. The program's signature moment, though, came from a victory at No. 17 Auburn in overtime two weeks ago. 
 ''I said in the first interviews I even did that I wanted to take the program where it's never been before,'' Moffitt said. ''It's pretty surreal, it's pretty awesome.''
 Moffitt has started 32 consecutive games and is fast enough that he chased down West Virginia quarterback Pat White from behind last season. 
 But what really impresses those who know Moffitt, who has a 2.5 grade point average, is how he balances football, classes and family. 
 ''He carries himself on the field and off with the maturity of a guy who is 40 years old,'' the U.S.F. assistant Dan McCarney said. 
 On Monday, Moffitt dressed Trevor and Rylan before slipping out to U.S.F. He then made the drive before attending two communication classes, which included a discussion of the difference between Wal-Mart and Target. 
 ''Knowing how far he has to come and how much else he has on his plate, it was always almost amazing to see him there every day,'' said Michael LeVan, one of Moffitt's former communication instructors. ''He was always there, awake and alert.''
 Moffitt then rushed off to buy a sandwich at Subway, but had time to eat only half. That was because an hour of weight lifting and 90 minutes of film work awaited him. After a two-hour practice, Moffitt showered and got in his Yaris, a 2007 with more than 25,000 miles, for the ride home around 6:30 p.m. It was an easy day compared with most Mondays, when he returns home at 10:30 p.m. 
 Moffitt does not think what he is doing is a particularly big deal because his classes at U.S.F., a university where most of the 45,000 students are commuters, are filled with students who juggle families, jobs and class work. 
 ''People ask me how you do it with a family,'' he said. ''Well, a lot of these people have families. Everyone has to get to that point in their life sooner or later when you have a family and a job. You get used to it, it becomes second nature.''
 And after a while, Moffitt and U.S.F. have found that long rides can help them reach unexpected destinations.

HEADLINE: Currency Parity Brings Canadian Shoppers South

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY and KATIE ZEZIMA; William Yardley reported from Blaine, Wash., and Katie Zezima from Boston. David Staba contributed from Niagara Falls, N.Y.

DATELINE: BLAINE, Wash., Sept. 21 

 BODY:
Tracey Carle checked the Web on Friday morning to see the wait times at the border and then bolted to the United States to shop. 
 Ms. Carle left her home in the border town of Surrey, British Columbia, cruised through the increasingly tight border here in a relatively breezy 34 minutes, stopped immediately to gas up her sport utility vehicle on the cheap at the U.S.A. Mini Mart and shot down Interstate 5 toward her real target, Target.
 ''Anytime in the last few years it's been better,'' said Ms. Carle, 49, explaining that she has long crossed the border for bargains. ''But now, this is just whoo-hoo!'' 
 The whoo-hoo part, as Ms. Carle and countless other Canadians have demonstrated recently, is tied directly to the steady rise of the Canadian dollar against its American counterpart in recent years, becoming its economic equal this week for the first time in three decades.
 On either side of the border, a buck is now a buck, or as Canadians call it on their side, a loonie. Coupled with high prices and high taxes for many things in Canada, the strength of the Canadian dollar is driving Canadians into the United States to shop for shoes, school supplies, gasoline, used cars and second homes.
 ''It's huge,'' said Jessica Smith, a stockbroker who lives near Toronto and spent the day shopping with a friend in nearby Niagara Falls, N.Y. ''But for my clients with investments in the U.S., it wipes them out.''
 Sure enough, not everyone is giddy. The weakness of the American dollar worries some Canadian investors as well as businesses that rely on American customers. It is also not helping American tourism in Canada, where the number of visitors from the United States has been declining since before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
 The rush to cross into the United States is complicated by new restrictions at the border, where proof of nationality is increasingly expected and passports are set to become mandatory as early as January. Here at the busy crossing in Blaine, the border is likely to be even more clogged because of construction to expand the number of lanes in preparation for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia.
 ''We're looking at a flood, but the dam is the border, and it's tough getting everything through that border,'' said Mike Kent, a real estate agent in Birch Bay, an area south of Blaine where Mr. Kent said Canadians had been buying property that looks at the pricier hills of their homeland.
 ''In a perfect world, the dollar would have gone par when the border was finished,'' Mr. Kent said. ''It's come at exactly the wrong time.''
 Still, Mr. Kent and others in real estate and retail on the United States side of the border are pleased by the turnaround. Five years ago, the Canadian dollar was worth just more than 60 cents in American money.
 ''They were always reminding you of how much it cost them,'' Debbie Morley, the manager at West Marine Express, a boat supply store in Blaine, said of Canadian shoppers, who provide 60 percent to 70 percent of the store's business. ''Now they're just so happy. They say, 'I can buy more!' ''
 Experts emphasize that the shifts in the border economy have not occurred overnight, that the loonie has been inching toward equality for several years. Some Canadians said Friday that they had shopped in the United States even when the Canadian dollar was weak, because of better prices.
 Hart Hodges, director of the Center for Economic and Business Research at Western Washington University, noted that while the number of Canadians coming across the border has been increasing in recent months, the numbers remain far lower than they were before the border became tighter. He also said that many major American retailers had opened stores in Canada since the last time the Canadian dollar was strong, in the early 1990s, and that Canadians who shopped south were now often seeking specific items like electronics or specials at Target and Nordstrom.
 Yet the idea of ''parity'' in the two currencies has added momentum to make the crossing. ''Everybody's talking about it at work,'' said Ms. Carle.
 In Vermont, Buzz Roy, owner of Brown's Drugstore in Derby Line, said of his Canadian customers: ''They don't buy anything in particular, but everything in general. We've seen a gradual increase over the summer, and we've seen a bigger increase this week.'' 
 Mr. Roy said more customers would make trips if it were easier to cross the border, ''but they're still coming in droves.''
 In North Dakota, Crystal Schlecht, who works for the City of Cavalier, said the arts and crafts show in town last weekend had a surprisingly international feel in spite of the slow-go at the border crossing.
 ''I'd say 60 percent of the people the whole weekend were from Canada,'' she said. ''And we've never really had that before.''

HEADLINE: As the World Comes to Georgia, an Old Church Adapts

BYLINE: By WARREN ST. JOHN

DATELINE: CLARKSTON, Ga., Sept. 21 

 BODY:
 When the Rev. Phil Kitchin steps into the pulpit of the Clarkston International Bible Church on Sunday mornings, he stands eye to eye with the changing face of America. In the pews before him, alongside white-haired Southern women in their Sunday best, sit immigrants from the Philippines and Togo, refugees from war-scarred Liberia, Ethiopia and Sudan, even a convert from Afghanistan. 
 ''Jesus said heaven is a place for people of all nations,'' Mr. Kitchin likes to say. ''So if you don't like Clarkston, you won't like heaven.''
 The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once noted that 11 a.m. on Sunday was the beginning of the most segregated hour of the week in America, and for the better part of 120 years, that certainly applied to this church. From 1883 until a few years ago, anyone on the pulpit would have gazed out at a congregation that was exclusively white. The church is a member of the Southern Baptist Convention, a group that in 1995 renounced its racist past. 
 But an influx of immigrants and refugees transformed this town in a little over a decade, and in the process sparked a battle within this church over its identity and its faithfulness to the Bible, one that led it to change not just its name but its mission.
 The Clarkston International Bible Church, which sits along an active freight rail line down the road from the former Ku Klux Klan bastion of Stone Mountain, is now home to parishioners from more than 15 countries. The church also houses congregations of Ethiopians, Sudanese, Liberians and French West Africans who worship separately, according to their own traditions. The church's Sunday potluck lunch features African stews and Asian vegetable dishes alongside hot dogs, sweet tea and homemade cherry pie.
 The transformation of what was long known as the Clarkston Baptist Church speaks to a broader change among other American churches. Many evangelical Christians who have long believed in spreading their religion in faraway lands have found that immigrants offer an opportunity for church work within one's own community. And many immigrants and refugees are drawn by the warm welcome they get from the parishioners, which can stand in stark contrast to the more competitive and alienating nature of workaday America.
 Indeed, evangelical churches have begun to stand out as rare centers of ethnic mixing in a country that researchers say has become more culturally fragmented, in part because of immigration.
 A recent study by the Harvard political scientist Robert D. Putnam underscored the practical complications of diversity. In interviews with 30,000 Americans, the study found that residents of more diverse communities ''tend to withdraw from collective life,'' voting less and volunteering less than those in more homogeneous communities.
 The study noted a conspicuous exception.
 ''In many large evangelical congregations,'' the researchers wrote, ''the participants constituted the largest thoroughly integrated gatherings we have ever witnessed.''
 Change Comes to Town
 Diversity came to Clarkston like a bolt from the blue. The community, just east of the Atlanta Perimeter and 11 miles from downtown, was settled by white farmers and railroad workers in the late 1800s.
 Clarkston remained rural and mostly white until the 1970s, when developers began to build apartment complexes for middle-class workers drawn to Atlanta after the international airport here opened. In the next decade, many of those workers began to move to new suburbs farther from town. Vacancies increased, rents fell and crime rose.
 In the 1990s, aid agencies that contract with the federal government to resettle refugees pegged Clarkston as the perfect place for these vulnerable newcomers. The town had cheap housing: those empty apartments. It had public transportation -- few refugees could afford cars. And Clarkston was within commuting distance of downtown Atlanta's booming economy.
 From 1996 to 2001, more than 19,000 refugees were resettled in Georgia, many in Clarkston or surrounding DeKalb County.
 The change to Clarkston was profound. The schools became crowded with children who spoke little English. Locals learned not to drive down Indian Creek Drive on Friday afternoons because of traffic from Friday prayers at the mosque. A third to a half of Clarkston's 7,100 residents are now foreign-born, most of them refugees. 
 Some older residents left town, alienated and concerned over the quality of education at the overburdened schools. 
 Many of those families had attended the Clarkston Baptist Church, leaving empty pews. By the end of the decade the church had canceled one of its two Sunday services. The congregation had dwindled to fewer than 100 from 600.
 Concerned about its survival, the church commissioned a study that found blacks and immigrants would soon outnumber whites in the area. William S. Perrin, 75 and a member of the church since 1948, said that at one meeting on the issue, a deacon stood up to express his anger.
 ''If you think black folks are going to come in here and take our church away from us,'' Mr. Perrin remembers the man saying, ''you got another thing coming.''
 Reaching Out
 William Perrin was no stranger to such attitudes. A retired Army lieutenant colonel who survived a midair collision over Vietnam, he grew up in Clarkston before the civil rights era. Some old ideas about race were embedded in his own psyche. 
 He recalled that while in the Army he once used a racial epithet in front of a black pilot he admired. When he realized what he had done, Mr. Perrin said, he broke down, hugged the pilot and begged for forgiveness.
 ''I'm ashamed of myself,'' he said he told the man. ''That's just my white upbringing in Georgia.'' 
 The pilot forgave Mr. Perrin, who then vowed never to disrespect another person because of race or ethnicity.
 With his church failing, Mr. Perrin and other longtime members looked to the Scriptures for guidance and found what they believed was a mandate from Jesus to diversify their church. 
 ''We realized that what the Lord had in store for that old Clarkston Baptist Church was to transition into a truly international church and to help minister to all these ethnic groups moving into the county,'' Mr. Perrin said.
 To offset costs during the lean years, the Clarkston Baptist Church had leased space to congregations of Filipinos, Vietnamese and Africans for their own services. Mr. Perrin and other members of the church proposed that they invite these congregations to join them as a single multiethnic church.
 While an outspoken advocate for diversity within his church, Mr. Perrin is quick to point out that he is no liberal. He voted twice for President Bush. Mr. Perrin said he advocated for an international church because the Bible told him to.
 That view is growing more common among conservative Christians, said Mark DeYmaz, a leading proponent of multicultural churches and the pastor of the Mosaic Church of Central Arkansas, in Little Rock, a congregation of 700 from some 30 countries.
 In the Book of John, Mr. DeYmaz points out, Jesus is portrayed after the Last Supper as praying for unity among his followers, a message he said runs counter to the notion of an ethnically homogeneous church.
 The idea of combining their old Baptist church with congregations of Filipinos and Africans appalled some older white members of the Clarkston Baptist Church, who feared giving up their ways of worship. Some threatened to leave.
 ''They struggled,'' said Allen Hill, the pastor at the time and now an official with the Georgia Baptist Convention. ''It's something Southern Baptists have to struggle with more than others because of our history.''
 That history stretches back to 1845, when the Southern Baptist Convention was formed by a group that seceded from a larger national Baptist organization after that group decreed it would not appoint slaveholders as missionaries. 
 In 1995, the Southern Baptist Convention apologized for its failure to support civil rights and for its congregations that ''intentionally and/or unintentionally'' excluded blacks. To this day, the overwhelming majority of its members are white, said Michael O. Emerson, a professor of sociology at Rice University who has studied the group.
 In 2004, the Clarkston Baptist Church adopted the changes proposed by elders like Mr. Perrin, and merged with the Filipino and Nigerian congregations. 
 They renamed their church the Clarkston International Bible Church. 
 That change was too much for many of the older members, like Brenda and Robert White. They left after more than 20 years as members.
 ''I really resented that,'' Mrs. White said of the name change. ''I know it's the 21st century and we have to change and do things differently. But I don't think it's fair that we had to cater to the foreign people rather than them trying to change to our way of doing things.''
 ''It just wasn't Baptist church anymore,'' she said. 
 A New Church Thrives
 Rosa Paige, a 79-year-old Alabama native and member of the church for 46 years, winced and put her fingers in her ears. The staid Baptist hymns of her old church have been replaced by ''praise music,'' contemporary Christian songs, played by teenagers on electric guitars, that church leaders thought would appeal to new congregants.
 ''It's a little loud for me sometimes,'' Mrs. Paige said.
 Merging congregations has meant compromise for everyone. The immigrants who join the main congregation have to give up worshiping in their native languages. Older Southern Baptist parishioners have given up traditional hymns and organ music.
 Other areas, like the potluck lunch in the gym every Sunday, have required little adjustment. ''Everybody likes everybody else's food,'' Mr. Perrin said.
 The pastor, Mr. Kitchin, a North Carolina native, joined the church in 2006 and learned quickly to keep his sermons simple because so many in his new congregation were just learning English.
 ''I'd say, 'You can take it to the bank,' and nobody had a clue what I was talking about,'' he said in a thick drawl. 
 Mr. Kitchin described his job as part minister, part cultural translator. Church members seek his advice and help.
 Recently, Mr. Kitchin said, a Liberian refugee asked him to sponsor a child's visa so the man's family could be reunited. Mr. Kitchin declined.
 ''If I do it for him, I have to do it for everyone in the church who wants their children to come in,'' he said. ''To tell this man no rips your heart out.''
 There are other problems beyond the church's front doors. Not everyone in the community has appreciated the church's efforts to proselytize among Clarkston's newcomers. Salahadin Wazir, the imam at al-Momineen mosque here, said he frequently heard from Muslim refugees and immigrants who say they attended a community outreach program administered by the church where conversation quickly turned to the teachings of Jesus.
 ''It's inappropriate,'' Mr. Wazir said. ''Playing on the minds of small children or desperate, needy people -- that's not the way to preach.''
 Mr. Kitchin said he heard such complaints frequently, but he does not apologize.
 ''I'm a believer in Jesus Christ, and I am commanded by him to go and tell everybody who he is,'' he said. ''And because we're in a free country you have the freedom to choose.''
 ''How can you choose if you don't know what's available?'' 
 Despite those tensions, Mr. Kitchin's church is now thriving. The congregation has grown to more than 300 from 100 a few years ago, and the 10:45 a.m. service on Sundays, which Mr. Kitchin leads, is well attended.
 Ultimately, Mr. Kitchin hopes, the groups who worship separately will join the larger congregation as the Filipino and Nigerian congregations did; many of the youngest members, who prefer church in English, already have. 
 But those congregations face the same tough choices as did the old white Baptist church. Some have been torn between a desire to assimilate and a fear of giving up their own identities.
 That is the case with the Liberian congregation led by the Rev. Peter Nehsahn. His flock had considered joining the larger group but decided against it for now, for fear of losing elements of their worship style, which includes drumming and singing African hymns.
 ''Our people might get lost in the mix,'' Mr. Nehsahn said.
 But even worshiping separately within the church gives some of the newcomers a sense of connection to the Clarkston community they would not get if they worshiped alone.
 For many of those who have joined the main congregation, the experience has been life changing. Marcelle Bess, a white American and a lifelong member of the church, said two of her daughters were dating young Filipino men they had met through the church. She hopes they will marry, she said.
 Mr. Perrin said the impact of the church on his life hit him when he and his wife were traveling through the Midwest. They stopped to worship at whatever Baptist church they could find.
 ''Every church that we walked into was pure white Caucasian,'' he said. ''My wife and I really felt uncomfortable, because, we realized, here in Clarkston is what the world is all about.''
 Mr. Kitchin thinks that in the not-so-distant future many more American churches will face the sort of questions his church has. He said he was frequently asked for advice.
 ''I tell people, 'America is changing,' '' he said. '' 'Get over it.' ''

HEADLINE: What Has the Hamptons, 4 Airports and a Hankering for Independence?

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

DATELINE: FLORAL PARK, N.Y., Sept. 13 

 BODY:
Last month, a 45-year-old bachelor living in his parents' house here with plenty of online dreams (and no steady offline employment), posted a news release on his Web site announcing, ''A New Country Is Born.''
 The bottom of the release listed the source of the information as the ''governor of Independent Long Island.''
 That would-be governor would be the bachelor himself, Cesidio Tallini, who proposes that geographic Long Island -- comprising Brooklyn, Queens and Nassau and Suffolk Counties -- should secede from the United States and form the sovereign nation of Independent Long Island.
 ''Long Island's ridiculously high home prices and property taxes are driving away all our young people, which is a shame because we have the population and the wealth to be a self-sustaining sovereignty, which would streamline government and lower taxes,'' he said. 
 Anyway, he said, ''people have always thought of Long Island as a place unto itself,'' he said, adding that residents here ''are known for having an independent streak.''
 That streak is especially evident in Mr. Tallini, who lives on a quiet dead-end called Press Street, in an unremarkable middle-class neighborhood just east of Belmont Park racetrack near the Nassau-Queens border.
 In his opinion, Long Island is too often regarded as a punch line, a district of dubious distinction associated with bland housing developments, mall culture, hedonistic Hamptons lifestyle and a cast of crazy characters like Joey Buttafuoco.
 But he sees a cultural renaissance.
 Mr. Tallini has designed a national flag: a depiction of Long Island with its fishtail-like East End split into two forks, surrounded by four stars for the two counties and two boroughs. 
 He uses the logo on merchandise he sells from his Web site (www.ilination.com), on banners and mugs and T-shirts. And he has even formulated his own currency, calendar and religion.
 What he has not done is gather a single signature on a petition, gained the support of a politician, or even draft a referendum seeking voter approval.
 But he says he has laid the most important foundation: He has formed the new country in cyberspace.
 He has procured a top-level domain name, .ILI, instead of the traditional dot-com or dot-org suffix; the domain root .LI was already taken by Lichtenstein. For now, he uses the more accessible .com domain name. He envisions an Internet explosion that would provide a major economic engine for the new country.
 ''It would create a whole new culture, a modern-day renaissance, with technologically and cultural and even spiritual dimensions,'' he said.
 Mr. Tallini says high-level national intelligence officials oppose his plans and are closely monitoring him. What else, he asks, could explain the recent unexplained periodic cutoffs in his telephone service and broadband connections?
 To avoid being sabotaged online, he says, he has has set up an Internet server in Germany, as well as three in Italy, two in Pennsylvania and two in Florida.
 In a familiar revolutionary refrain, Mr. Tallini laments that Long Island, with one of the nation's highest median incomes, pays far more in taxes than it receives in state services. 
 After all, there was the city-imposed commuter tax a few years back, and there is its current plan to establish a fee to drive into parts of Manhattan on weekdays.
 ''We send too much money to Washington, and we're essentially subsidizing the rest of the state,'' he said. ''We have a lawmaking and economic system that favors everywhere else but here, be it Manhattan, upstate New York or the rest of the country.''
 For now, he has flirted with naming the new country Paumanok, which was the Native American name for Long Island, meaning ''the island that pays tribute.''
 ''The original Long Island tribes were peaceful, but the outside warlike tribes demanded tributes and payments or else they would attack,'' he said. ''And to this day, we remain the taxpaying tribe. 
 ''We're still the island that pays tribute. Only now, we pay it to tribes in Manhattan, Albany and Washington.''
 Mr. Tallini said taxes would be lower because of a single, streamlined government. 
 ''People would no longer would have to pay state and city and federal taxes for services they largely do not get,'' he said. ''We would be free from exorbitant federal taxes -- for one thing, we would need no military,'' he said, ''and since people would be healthier and more industrious, we would have less government spending on social services.'' 
 Although Long Island includes only suburban Nassau and Suffolk Counties, Mr. Tallini said he decided to include Brooklyn and Queens -- geographically part of the island -- to give the project more clout. 
 The new country would have four large airports and could revive much of the old Brooklyn waterfront for shipping -- not to mention its own Major League Baseball team in Queens. With a combined population of about 7.5 million, the new nation would have more people than 39 states.
 ''With Brooklyn and Queens, we would be the most ethnically diverse country in the world,'' he said.
 As he put it: ''Long Island is the most populated island in the contiguous United States. We're the 17th most populous island in the world, ahead of Ireland, Sicily and Jamaica. We have all the trappings of a new country.''
 Not that this would be the first attempt at secession on Long Island. 
 Over the years, there have been movements by Nassau and Suffolk Counties to form their own state and similar efforts by a group of East End towns, which wanted to break off from Suffolk County and become Peconic County. 
 In the 1990s, Staten Island proposed seceding from New York City.
 The Brooklyn borough president, Marty Markowitz, said his borough would take a pass on Mr. Tallini's secession offer. 
 ''Brooklyn definitely has veto power over that, because Long Island is really East Brooklyn,'' he said. ''I think Brooklyn should definitely be its own city again, but let's face it, George Washington fought too hard to make this island American soil.''
 When pressed -- really, really pressed -- Mr. Tallini admits that there is little chance of seceding, but some chance of calling attention to the perceived inequities. 
 ''If we stood up to Uncle Sam, we'd become icons of freedom for the whole planet,'' he declared on Thursday, working himself into a patriotic lather at the kitchen table in his parents' house.

HEADLINE: This Climate Is Surely Full Of Hot Air

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Sometimes the only thing to do is just state the obvious. So here goes: The climate change petition that was promoted last week as a boon for investors and for the environment has almost no chance of ever being adopted. Wait -- did I say almost? I take it back. It has no chance. Zero. Zilch. None. 
 The petition, on the off-chance you missed it, was drawn up by Environmental Defense, the big advocacy group, and Ceres, which describes itself as ''a leading coalition of investors, environmental groups and other public interest organizations working with companies to address sustainability challenges.'' It asks the Securities and Exchange Commission to force companies to begin disclosing their ''climate change risk'' in their financial documents. 
 The petition was given to the media in plenty of time for reporters to write what we in the business like to call ''curtain raisers,'' in advance of a big news conference that was held on Tuesday. Let it never be said that environmentalists don't know how to generate good publicity. 
 Of course, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York is no slouch in that department either. A few days earlier, Mr. Cuomo sent subpoenas -- that's right: subpoenas! -- to five companies who have the temerity to want to build coal-fired electric generating plants. He, too, claimed to be concerned with climate change risk. 
 ''The increase in CO2 emissions from the operation of these units, in combination with Peabody Energy's other coal-fired plants, will subject Peabody Energy to increased financial, regulatory and litigation risks,'' he wrote in the letter to Peabody Energy, the nation's largest coal company. He added, ''We are concerned that Peabody Energy has failed to disclose material information about the increased climate risks Peabody Energy's business faces.'' 
 In other words, Mr. Cuomo was going a good deal further than Ceres. He was claiming that under current S.E.C. rules, companies already had a duty to disclose ''climate change risk'' -- at least as those risks are defined by the New York attorney general's office. 
 (Never mind that none of the companies in Mr. Cuomo's sights are based in New York. As his predecessor, Eliot Spitzer, proved, when you're the attorney general of New York State you can pretty much investigate anything you want, anywhere in the United States, so long as you can make it appear to be somehow related to investor protection.) 
 ''If you take Exxon Mobil,'' said Mindy S. Lubber, the head of Ceres, ''they provide almost no analysis and disclosure of climate change as a business risk. I would argue that climate change is a huge threat to the company's business.'' She added, ''The role of the S.E.C. really is about making sure companies really do know the risks and disclose them so that investors can make smart decisions.''
 I realize that many of you have just put down your morning coffee in order to nod your head in approval. But I would ask you, please, hold the applause. Putting aside the fact that both the Ceres petition and the Cuomo subpoenas are feats primarily of environmental grandstanding, the real problem is that these measures, appealing though they may seem at first glance, are misleading and disingenuous. To put it more bluntly, they are an attempt to use regulation and litigation to force companies to toe the environmentist party line on global warming, and to change corporate business models in ways that are more pleasing to the environmental community. It's environmental tyranny disguised as public policy.
 By now, of course, there is no longer an argument over whether global warming is real; even Exxon Mobil is on board. (Question for William Safire: why did the phrase ''global warming'' morph into ''climate change?'' Just wondering.) The question of what this ultimately means, however, isn't remotely settled. Andrew Logan, who directs the energy and finance programs at Ceres, said that climate change is an issue that will ultimately put the big oil companies ''out of business.'' He added, ''We are heading towards catastrophe.'' 
 But Gregg Easterbrook at the Brookings Institution, author of ''The Progress Paradox,'' who has written lucidly over the years about environmental issues, said that it was far from certain that global warming would require radical changes, by either individuals or corporations. ''Global warming is fundamentally an air pollution problem,'' he said, ''and in the past, air pollution problems have turned out be far cheaper to fix and much more quickly corrected than anyone thought at first.'' 
 Indeed, Vic Svec, a spokesman for Peabody Energy, pointed out that previous furors over the pollution caused by coal-fired plants -- particulate matter and sulfur dioxide -- have largely been solved. Mr. Easterbrook told me that he suspected that the same would be true of carbon emissions. ''Someone will invent the gizmo'' that solves the problem, he said. 
 Whether you agree with that assessment or not, it is a legitimate point of view -- and corporations have every right to hold that view, and act on it in making investments for the future. History, after all, is full of instances where the sky was supposed to be falling -- and then didn't after someone ''invented the gizmo'' that took care of it (Y2K, anyone?). Yet underpinning the efforts by Mr. Cuomo and Ceres is the belief that such a view is not, in fact, a legitimate basis upon which to base corporate strategy -- and that companies need to be forced back into line. 
 Let's look at Mr. Cuomo's effort first, since it is the more egregious of the two. When I spoke to Eric O. Corngold, Mr. Cuomo's executive deputy attorney general for economic justice, he took umbrage at my suggestion that his office was trying to get companies to toe some party line. ''Climate change is perhaps the central issue energy companies are going to face,'' he said -- stating as fact something that many energy executives might well disagree with. He added, ''We just want to make sure that what companies are telling investors is fair, complete and not misleading.'' 
 So how is the attorney general conducting his investigation into corporations hoping to build coal-fired power plants? By asking for internal documents and e-mail messages that might show -- let's cross our fingers! -- that executives fear bigger risks in building new coal-fired plants than they have acknowledged publicly. In other words, he wants to do to Peabody Energy what Mr. Spitzer did to Henry Blodget and Merrill Lynch. 
 And why is he doing this? For the same purpose that Mr. Spitzer used the Blodget e-mail: to force an industry to change its behavior. See, once he has the messages in hand, he can brandish them before the court of public opinion to ''prove'' that Peabody Energy is hiding the truth about the risks inherent in building coal fired plants. Of course, at least part of the risk facing Peabody Energy is the risk of being sued by environmentalists -- who will use Mr. Cuomo's ''evidence'' to do just that. It's lovely the way this works, isn't it? You investigate them for not disclosing risk, even as you're creating the risk through your investigation. 
 When you think about it, Mr. Cuomo could do this to any company over any business decision he happened to disagree with. For instance, he could subpoena General Electric to investigate whether the company's upbeat rhetoric surrounding Ecomagination, the company's new environmental thrust, reflects its internal view. I can guarantee that he would find plenty of embarrassing ''evidence'' showing top-ranking officials disagreeing vehemently with the chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, who essentially shoved Ecomagination down their throats. But Mr. Cuomo would never conduct such an investigation. By his lights, Ecomagination is to be encouraged, not stopped.
 What's more, when I went to Peabody Energy's annual report, I saw a section that talked about climate change risks in the same fashion as it talked about the other risks the S.E.C. mandates in financial disclosure documents. John Hill, an analyst who follows the company for Citigroup, said, ''I can tell you for a fact that the whole subject of global warming and climate change is extensively disclosed by Peabody.'' 
 To her credit, Ms. Lubber at Ceres was at least honest enough to admit that her goal is not just to get companies to disclose more information but to change their behavior. ''What gets measured gets managed,'' she said. She and Mr. Logan believe that if companies were forced to lay out for investors how global warming could affect their businesses, it might then cause them to want to make their business models more environmentally friendly. ''When they look more broadly at the risks,'' Mr. Logan said, ''they'll start making different investment decisions.''
 But, as Mr. Easterbrook asks, if the S.E.C. ever decided to act on the Ceres petition, ''What do you actually disclose? What do you warn your shareholders about?'' The law says that companies have to disclose anything that could have a ''material adverse effect'' on the business. There is simply no way of knowing right now whether global warming will have any effect at all on companies, much less a material adverse one. Looking out into the future to assess climate change risk is really little more than an exercise in public relations. Last time I looked, BP was one oil company that was big on disclosing climate change risk -- when it wasn't busy cleaning up after itself in Alaska.
 When I put that question to Ms. Lubber and Mr. Logan, one of their responses was that companies needed to disclose regulatory risk -- the fact that Congress is in the process of teeing up bills that will tax carbon emissions, for instance. But even that risk is impossible to gauge: there is no consensus on what bill will emerge, or when, or how much it will cost. ''The unstated presumption is that punitive, onerous legislation is coming your way that will cost you a lot of money,'' Mr. Easterbrook said.
 In the end, both the Ceres and Cuomo efforts are little more than sideshows -- but telling ones nonetheless. They presume that all right-thinking people should believe what they believe about global warming -- and that therefore public policy can be built around those presumptions. They assume that the big, bad corporations must be brought to heel even as the rest of us continue to buy our S.U.V.'s and sixth iPod. They completely ignore the obvious fact that our energy needs continue to rise -- and that the threat that's actually imminent is that we won't have enough conventional power plants to keep the country's lights on. As they are using weapons -- S.E.C. proposals; Martin Act investigation -- that really have nothing to do with global warming. 
 If you want to attack global warming, then for goodness sake, attack global warming. But trying to force change through the bogus mechanism of ''investor disclosure?'' It would be funny if it weren't so sad.

HEADLINE: The Rate-Cut Rally Continues

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks rose soundly yesterday, capping a week of gains for Wall Street, as investors drew confidence from strong results at the Oracle Corporation and a continued sense that lower interest rates should help the economy.
 The expiration of futures and options contracts made for heavier trading than the markets generally have had in recent weeks.
 Oracle's report that quarterly profit had risen 25 percent as sales grew at the fastest rate in seven years offered evidence that some sectors of the economy continue to hum along even as areas like housing cause consternation for many investors. 
 Wall Street found renewed optimism this week after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by half a percentage point on Tuesday, more than many expected. The central bank also lowered by half a point the rate it charges to lend directly to banks.
 ''As much as we often underestimate the depth of our problems, it's also natural for us to underestimate the depth and robustness of our economy. There are many industry segments that are very healthy,'' said Robert Brown, chief investment officer at Genworth Financial Asset Management, pointing to stronger-than-expected earnings reports. He said that although Wall Street's exuberance over the Fed's rate cuts is understandable, investors are blithely looking past some of the concerns the economy faces.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 53.49 points, or 0.39 percent, to 13,820.19.
 Broader indicators also rose. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 7.00 points, or 0.46 percent, to 1,525.75, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 16.93 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,671.22.
 Friday's session brought ''triple witching,'' a quarterly occurrence when investors face simultaneous expiration of contracts for stock index futures, index options and stock options. Those four days each year usually bring higher-than-normal volume as investors jockey for new positions.
 Bonds rose, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note at 101, up from 100 13/32 late Thursday; the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.62 percent from 4.70 percent.
 Treasuries had sold off for three straight sessions amid concerns about inflation and speculation that Saudi Arabia might reduce its holdings of United States government securities. The stock gains have also drained some money out of bonds.
 Mr. Brown says the stock and bond markets have diverged; the equity market is regarding the Fed's rate cut as providing adequate liquidity to propel stocks to new highs.
 Stocks pulled off their highs yesterday afternoon after a Fed governor, Kevin M. Warsh, warned that the central bank would not bail out Wall Street to protect profits but said the Fed was focused on protecting the economy.
 Noman Ali, portfolio manager with MFC Global Investment Management, said yesterday's advance in part reflected a sense of enthusiasm renewed by the Fed's rate cuts. There was relief, too, that the major brokerage firms reporting results this week turned in better results than Wall Street had expected after recent upheaval in the credit markets.
 Crude oil futures for November delivery fell 16 cents to settle at $81.61 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Thursday, the October contract, now expired, closed at a record high, above $83 a barrel.
 Gold prices rose, while the dollar bounced back after hitting another record low against the euro, which surpassed $1.41 for the first time. The dollar slumped against other major currencies.
 Oracle rose 93 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $21.98 after its earnings report.
 Harman International Industries fell $23.49, or 21 percent, to $88.76, before trading was halted. Harman, which makes upscale audio equipment, confirmed reports that two private equity firms had backed out of their $8 billion buyout deal.
 The cosmetics maker Estee Lauder advanced $1.95, or 4.8 percent, to $42.58, amid takeover rumors. And Joy Global, a mining equipment company, rose 91 cents, to $49.59, after affirming its full-year earnings and revenue forecasts.

HEADLINE: This Climate Is Surely Full Of Hot Air

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Sometimes the only thing to do is just state the obvious. So here goes: The climate change petition that was promoted last week as a boon for investors and for the environment has almost no chance of ever being adopted. Wait -- did I say almost? I take it back. It has no chance. Zero. Zilch. None. 
 The petition, on the off-chance you missed it, was drawn up by Environmental Defense, the big advocacy group, and Ceres, which describes itself as ''a leading coalition of investors, environmental groups and other public interest organizations working with companies to address sustainability challenges.'' It asks the Securities and Exchange Commission to force companies to begin disclosing their ''climate change risk'' in their financial documents. 
 The petition was given to the media in plenty of time for reporters to write what we in the business like to call ''curtain raisers,'' in advance of a big news conference that was held on Tuesday. Let it never be said that environmentalists don't know how to generate good publicity. 
 Of course, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York is no slouch in that department either. A few days earlier, Mr. Cuomo sent subpoenas -- that's right: subpoenas! -- to five companies who have the temerity to want to build coal-fired electric generating plants. He, too, claimed to be concerned with climate change risk. 
 ''The increase in CO2 emissions from the operation of these units, in combination with Peabody Energy's other coal-fired plants, will subject Peabody Energy to increased financial, regulatory and litigation risks,'' he wrote in the letter to Peabody Energy, the nation's largest coal company. He added, ''We are concerned that Peabody Energy has failed to disclose material information about the increased climate risks Peabody Energy's business faces.'' 
 In other words, Mr. Cuomo was going a good deal further than Ceres. He was claiming that under current S.E.C. rules, companies already had a duty to disclose ''climate change risk'' -- at least as those risks are defined by the New York attorney general's office. 
 (Never mind that none of the companies in Mr. Cuomo's sights are based in New York. As his predecessor, Eliot Spitzer, proved, when you're the attorney general of New York State you can pretty much investigate anything you want, anywhere in the United States, so long as you can make it appear to be somehow related to investor protection.) 
 ''If you take Exxon Mobil,'' said Mindy S. Lubber, the head of Ceres, ''they provide almost no analysis and disclosure of climate change as a business risk. I would argue that climate change is a huge threat to the company's business.'' She added, ''The role of the S.E.C. really is about making sure companies really do know the risks and disclose them so that investors can make smart decisions.''
 I realize that many of you have just put down your morning coffee in order to nod your head in approval. But I would ask you, please, hold the applause. Putting aside the fact that both the Ceres petition and the Cuomo subpoenas are feats primarily of environmental grandstanding, the real problem is that these measures, appealing though they may seem at first glance, are misleading and disingenuous. To put it more bluntly, they are an attempt to use regulation and litigation to force companies to toe the environmentist party line on global warming, and to change corporate business models in ways that are more pleasing to the environmental community. It's environmental tyranny disguised as public policy.
 By now, of course, there is no longer an argument over whether global warming is real; even Exxon Mobil is on board. (Question for William Safire: why did the phrase ''global warming'' morph into ''climate change?'' Just wondering.) The question of what this ultimately means, however, isn't remotely settled. Andrew Logan, who directs the energy and finance programs at Ceres, said that climate change is an issue that will ultimately put the big oil companies ''out of business.'' He added, ''We are heading towards catastrophe.'' 
 But Gregg Easterbrook at the Brookings Institution, author of ''The Progress Paradox,'' who has written lucidly over the years about environmental issues, said that it was far from certain that global warming would require radical changes, by either individuals or corporations. ''Global warming is fundamentally an air pollution problem,'' he said, ''and in the past, air pollution problems have turned out be far cheaper to fix and much more quickly corrected than anyone thought at first.'' 
 Indeed, Vic Svec, a spokesman for Peabody Energy, pointed out that previous furors over the pollution caused by coal-fired plants -- particulate matter and sulfur dioxide -- have largely been solved. Mr. Easterbrook told me that he suspected that the same would be true of carbon emissions. ''Someone will invent the gizmo'' that solves the problem, he said. 
 Whether you agree with that assessment or not, it is a legitimate point of view -- and corporations have every right to hold that view, and act on it in making investments for the future. History, after all, is full of instances where the sky was supposed to be falling -- and then didn't after someone ''invented the gizmo'' that took care of it (Y2K, anyone?). Yet underpinning the efforts by Mr. Cuomo and Ceres is the belief that such a view is not, in fact, a legitimate basis upon which to base corporate strategy -- and that companies need to be forced back into line. 
 Let's look at Mr. Cuomo's effort first, since it is the more egregious of the two. When I spoke to Eric O. Corngold, Mr. Cuomo's executive deputy attorney general for economic justice, he took umbrage at my suggestion that his office was trying to get companies to toe some party line. ''Climate change is perhaps the central issue energy companies are going to face,'' he said -- stating as fact something that many energy executives might well disagree with. He added, ''We just want to make sure that what companies are telling investors is fair, complete and not misleading.'' 
 So how is the attorney general conducting his investigation into corporations hoping to build coal-fired power plants? By asking for internal documents and e-mail messages that might show -- let's cross our fingers! -- that executives fear bigger risks in building new coal-fired plants than they have acknowledged publicly. In other words, he wants to do to Peabody Energy what Mr. Spitzer did to Henry Blodget and Merrill Lynch. 
 And why is he doing this? For the same purpose that Mr. Spitzer used the Blodget e-mail: to force an industry to change its behavior. See, once he has the messages in hand, he can brandish them before the court of public opinion to ''prove'' that Peabody Energy is hiding the truth about the risks inherent in building coal fired plants. Of course, at least part of the risk facing Peabody Energy is the risk of being sued by environmentalists -- who will use Mr. Cuomo's ''evidence'' to do just that. It's lovely the way this works, isn't it? You investigate them for not disclosing risk, even as you're creating the risk through your investigation. 
 When you think about it, Mr. Cuomo could do this to any company over any business decision he happened to disagree with. For instance, he could subpoena General Electric to investigate whether the company's upbeat rhetoric surrounding Ecomagination, the company's new environmental thrust, reflects its internal view. I can guarantee that he would find plenty of embarrassing ''evidence'' showing top-ranking officials disagreeing vehemently with the chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, who essentially shoved Ecomagination down their throats. But Mr. Cuomo would never conduct such an investigation. By his lights, Ecomagination is to be encouraged, not stopped.
 What's more, when I went to Peabody Energy's annual report, I saw a section that talked about climate change risks in the same fashion as it talked about the other risks the S.E.C. mandates in financial disclosure documents. John Hill, an analyst who follows the company for Citigroup, said, ''I can tell you for a fact that the whole subject of global warming and climate change is extensively disclosed by Peabody.'' 
 To her credit, Ms. Lubber at Ceres was at least honest enough to admit that her goal is not just to get companies to disclose more information but to change their behavior. ''What gets measured gets managed,'' she said. She and Mr. Logan believe that if companies were forced to lay out for investors how global warming could affect their businesses, it might then cause them to want to make their business models more environmentally friendly. ''When they look more broadly at the risks,'' Mr. Logan said, ''they'll start making different investment decisions.''

But even that risk is impossible to gauge: there is no consensus on what bill will emerge, or when, or how much it will cost. ''The unstated presumption is that punitive, onerous legislation is coming your way that will cost you a lot of money,'' Mr. Easterbrook said.
 In the end, both the Ceres and Cuomo efforts are little more than sideshows -- but telling ones nonetheless. They presume that all right-thinking people should believe what they believe about global warming -- and that therefore public policy can be built around those presumptions. They assume that the big, bad corporations must be brought to heel even as the rest of us continue to buy our S.U.V.'s and sixth iPod. They completely ignore the obvious fact that our energy needs continue to rise -- and that the threat that's actually imminent is that we won't have enough conventional power plants to keep the country's lights on. As they are using weapons -- S.E.C. proposals; Martin Act investigation -- that really have nothing to do with global warming. 
 If you want to attack global warming, then for goodness sake, attack global warming. But trying to force change through the bogus mechanism of ''investor disclosure?'' It would be funny if it weren't so sad.

HEADLINE: When Markets Are Too Big to Fail

 BODY:
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. cautioned lawmakers this week about the pitfalls in one of Congress's key proposals to help defaulting homeowners. 
 Several lawmakers want to temporarily expand Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the big government-sponsored housing agencies, to allow for more mortgage lending and refinancings for homeowners facing foreclosure. Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson expressed concern that the economy could be harmed if the agencies took on too much risk and then, by some calamity, needed a government bailout. Any larger role, they warned, would have to be accompanied by clear rules and strict oversight. 
 We support expanding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and don't have a problem with carefully regulating their activities. What is unacceptable is that neither Mr. Bernanke nor Mr. Paulson has called for new rules to constrain excessive risk-taking in the financial markets -- activities like creating and selling securities backed by utterly reckless loans -- even though those risks have greatly contributed to the markets' instability and have repeatedly required government intervention. 
 The worthy goal of the Fed's recent interventions -- including this week's half a percentage point interest rate cut -- is to prevent disruptions in the financial markets from harming the broader economy. But they come with considerable risk. The rate cut, for instance, could backfire, unleashing inflation for reasons not entirely within the Fed's control. 
 When it comes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the presumed government backing is called an ''implicit guarantee.'' On Wall Street, it has many names -- ex-post insurance, a Greenspan put, or now, a Bernanke put. Whatever you call it, its existence demands that markets be subject to adequate rules and oversight. 
 That's clearly not the case at present. Hedge funds and private equity firms, which are allowed to operate largely in secret, need to be subject to more official scrutiny so that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have a grasp of their activities before big problems occur and so that investors affected by their actions can better assess the risks they're taking. Regulators must develop and coordinate a system for staying on top of the overlapping instruments and transactions that fuel market activity.
 Currently, regulators can't even decide if the derivatives at the heart of so much of today's instability are securities, which would fall under the purview of the securities' regulators, or futures contracts, the purview of commodities' regulators. 
 It is possible to strike a balance between monitoring markets and protecting proprietary information, between fostering innovation and curbing excessive risk-taking that all Americans end up on the hook for. Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson should be leading the way. If they won't, Congress and the next administration have their work cut out for them.

HEADLINE: Rice Says Paris Agrees On Pressing The Iranians

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
The United States and France agree on increasing diplomatic and economic pressure to force Iran to abandon its nuclear program, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Friday as the Bush administration played host to a meeting of major world powers to discuss another round of United Nations sanctions.
 ''I think it's first important to note that we have set out a diplomatic path that includes negotiation as the preferred means by which to resolve this issue,'' Ms. Rice said at a joint news conference with her French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner. 
 On Sunday, Mr. Kouchner kicked up a small diplomatic storm when he raised the possibility of war with Iran. He subsequently moderated his statements and dropped references to war. Ms. Rice noted that a diplomatic league of the five permanent Security Council members plus Germany had offered ''a very, very good package of initiatives that Iran could take up if it wished to stop its enrichment and reprocessing activity.'' 
 But she said, ''We will seek further resolutions in the U.N. Security Council should Iran not take up the negotiating track.''
 Toward that end, the Foreign Ministry political directors from Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia met at the State Department on Friday with R. Nicholas Burns, the United States under secretary of state for political affairs, to press ahead on a possible third Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on Iran. After the meeting, Mr. Burns issued a statement on behalf of the six officials that ''reaffirmed their commitment to maintain a dual-track approach on Iran's nuclear activities.''
 The discussions on Friday ''were serious and constructive,'' the statement said. The officials ''had a detailed discussion of the elements of a new United Nations Security Council resolution, as well as possibilities of continued dialogue with Iran.''
 Supporters of new sanctions were buoyed by a decision at the conclusion of Friday's meeting to schedule another working session next week. That meeting is ''to prepare recommendations'' for a high-level conference next Friday, at which Ms. Rice and her five ministerial counterparts will discuss the potential for a new sanctions resolution.
 Although senior officials from all six nations involved in the sanctions talks agreed on the urgency of preventing Iran from going nuclear, deep disagreements remained over the speed of imposing new sanctions, and on how deeply they should cut into the Iranian economy.
 Russia and China are the most reluctant to move ahead, while the United States is pushing for faster action. Iranian officials say their nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.
 In her public comments on Friday, Ms. Rice said that Paris and Washington were in consensus on Iran. ''I think that there is essentially no difference in the way that we see the situation in Iran and what the international community must do, and we are going to work toward that, toward that end,'' she said. 
 American efforts to push for more sanctions appear to have been aided by France's new leadership under President Nicolas Sarkozy, who has taken a stance on Iran much closer to Washington's hawkish policy views than that of his predecessor, Jacques Chirac.
 That is why special attention was being paid in Washington this week to the words chosen by Mr. Kouchner, the French foreign minister and co-founder of Doctors Without Borders, whose background in the humanitarian world made his remarks about the possibility of war all the more startling. He chose his words carefully on Friday, stressing the need for exploring all diplomatic avenues. Italy on Friday joined those urging more sanctions against Iran.
 ''There is still room for a strong initiative that can on one end put pressure through sanctions, even more severe sanctions, and on the other end really offer the possibility for negotiations and agreement,'' Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema said in an interview on Italian state television, according to news service reports from Rome.

HEADLINE: The Emergence of Bush, the Budget Warrior

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
George W. Bush ran for the White House as a compassionate conservative. Now he is portraying himself as a conservative of a different stripe -- the fiscal kind.
 Mr. Bush is headed into a spending battle with Congressional Democrats with the two branches of government as divided on the issue as they have been since the federal shutdown of 1995. The president has threatened to veto 10 of the 11 appropriations bills that have passed the House, as well as legislation expanding a popular children's health care program. On Monday, he will step up the fight with a speech accusing Democrats of fiscal irresponsibility.
 That might not sound altogether unexpected, given that Democrats, whom Mr. Bush accuses of ''working to bring back the failed tax-and-spend policies of the past,'' now run Congress. But the president's new tough talk on spending has also caught some fiscal conservatives in his own party off guard. After years lambasting Mr. Bush for letting government spending run out of control, they wonder what has gotten into him.
 ''I don't know what kind of epiphany he had,'' said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who fought on Capitol Hill to rein in the federal budget, to little avail. ''I'm just glad he had it.'' 
 It is a conversion, whether driven by newfound principle or changing circumstances, that has undeniable political benefits for a president struggling to reassert his authority when his standing even within his own party is under attack. 
 White House officials say Mr. Bush has not changed his stripes. ''There is no epiphany,'' Tony Fratto, the deputy White House press secretary, said. ''We have been fiscal conservatives throughout this administration.''
 But experts at two research institutions that support smaller government -- the Cato Institute, which has a libertarian bent, and the Heritage Foundation, a proponent of conservative economic policies -- say the White House has not been nearly conservative enough.
 While there may be explanations for higher spending, including the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Brian M. Reidl of Heritage says the federal budget has nonetheless grown at a rate of 7 percent a year under Mr. Bush, about twice the 3.5 percent rate under Bill Clinton.
 Chris Edwards of Cato says federal outlays, when adjusted for inflation, have increased faster under Mr. Bush than under any president since Jimmy Carter. ''When he gives speeches now, you hear him bashing the Democrats on overspending,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''It sounds ridiculous, because we know he's a big spender.''
 The names Reidl and Edwards may not be household words, but the name of another prominent critic of Mr. Bush's spending policies -- Alan Greenspan -- is.
 Mr. Greenspan rattled the White House this week with his new memoir, ''The Age of Turbulence,'' in which he accused the president of fiscal recklessness. Mr. Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, argued the president put Republican politics, and the desire of lawmakers to steer tax dollars to their districts, ahead of sound fiscal policy. 
 In an unusually public airing of differences, Vice President Dick Cheney struck back at Mr. Greenspan on the op-ed page of The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, issuing what he called ''gentle reminders'' asserting that the administration had a strong record of fiscal prudence. At a news conference Thursday, Mr. Bush brushed off Mr. Greenspan's criticism. 
 ''My feelings are not hurt,'' the president said.
 The federal budget was running a surplus when Mr. Clinton left office and was projected to reduce the national debt over a number of years, putting the government in a better fiscal position to deal with the looming costs from the aging of the baby boom generation.
 The economic expansion of the 1990s ended, reducing the growth of tax revenue at the very time that Mr. Bush was pushing a long-term tax cut through Congress. Then came the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which imposed new spending demands on the government. 
 Military and domestic security spending shot up. Experts say those increases, coupled with Mr. Bush's tax cuts, helped drive up the federal deficit, which peaked at $413 billion in 2004. It has since narrowed to a projected $170 billion for this year, the result of an improving economy and rising tax revenues. 
 But both Mr. Reidl and Mr. Edwards say that even so-called nonmilitary discretionary spending -- the portion of the budget that a president can rein in, because it does not go to entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid -- has grown faster under Mr. Bush than Mr. Clinton. (To the consternation of many conservatives, Mr. Bush also signed into a law a major expansion of Medicare, adding prescription drug coverage for retirees.)
 When Republicans ran Congress, Mr. Bush never vetoed a spending bill, despite calls for him to do so from fiscal conservatives, including Jim Nussle, the former chairman of the House Budget Committee who has just become Mr. Bush's new budget director. Peter Wehner, a former domestic policy adviser to Mr. Bush, says the president sometimes deferred to the House speaker at the time, J. Dennis Hastert.
 ''I think to some extent you're seeing a liberated George Bush,'' Mr. Wehner said, discussing the current spate of veto threats. ''When Hastert was speaker, one of his red lines was that he did not want any spending bills vetoed. That, to some extent, restricted the range of actions that we had. It made it difficult to veto certain bills like the transportation bill and the other ones conservatives didn't want.''
 Others see Mr. Bush reacting to Republican losses in the midterm elections of 2006. 
 ''All of us are smarting from the lessons of 2006, and while people are right to point to factors like the war and scandal, I hold the view that the biggest scandal in Washington, D.C., was runaway federal spending under Republican control,'' said Representative Mike Pence, Republican of Indiana.
 The White House explains the new veto threats by saying Republicans met the president's spending limits, while the Democrats, whose proposed 2009 budget exceeds Mr. Bush's by $22 billion, have not.
 Democrats respond that the White House is being hypocritical in accusing them of fiscal irresponsibility. ''If he was interested in fiscal discipline, he should have started $3 trillion ago,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.
 And Mr. Reidl says Democrats have simply been more straightforward about their plans to spend the taxpayers' money. They also have been willing to consider tax increases to cover them.
 By contrast, Mr. Reidl added, Republicans drove up spending through ''loopholes and gimmicks'' like tucking extra money into emergency spending bills.
 Historians say there is nothing like a good spending fight with Congress to boost a president's sagging fortunes. When Republicans shut down the government in late 1995, Mr. Clinton emerged the winner. So perhaps it should come as no surprise that, with just 16 months left in office and his approval ratings still crushed by the war in Iraq, Mr. Bush is putting up his fiscal dukes.
 ''In any kind of showdown with Congress, he does have the upper hand, because veto overrides are dauntingly difficult to achieve,'' said Ross K. Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University. ''It could conceivably mean racking up some victories for a president who desperately needs them.''
 Just how the spending impasse will be resolved is unclear.Both Democrats and White House officials say they want to avoid a shutdown. But conservatives are certainly happy to see their president taking on the fight.
 ''I think it will be good for the country, I think it will be good for the president and I think it will be good for the Republican Party,'' Mr. Pence said. ''I'm all for it. Let's rock 'n' roll.''

HEADLINE: Education And Schools Are a Focus For Edwards

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
The Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards laid out a proposal on Friday to overhaul the education system, saying that the current No Child Left Behind law was not working and that poor children were still being sent to schools that are ''separate and unequal.''
 Speaking at Brody Middle School here, Mr. Edwards outlined a plan that he said would evaluate students more effectively, reduce class sizes and reward teachers who work in high-poverty schools with up to $15,000 in incentive pay, initiatives similar to those championed by education officials in New York City and elsewhere. 
 He also called for universal preschool, the creation of a national university that would become a ''West Point for teachers'' and an initiative that uses what he described as ''education SWAT teams'' to sweep in and rebuild failing schools. 
 ''First, every child should be prepared to succeed when they show up in the classroom,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''Second, every classroom should be led by an excellent teacher. And third, every teacher should work in an outstanding school. These three principles should guide our reform.''
 He revived his campaign slogan of what he calls the ''two Americas,'' applying it to racial and economic disparities in education.
 ''More than a half-century after Brown v. Board of Education, we still have two school systems, separate and unequal,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''There are nearly 1,000 high schools where more than half of the students won't graduate -- they're called 'dropout factories.' '' 
 Mr. Edwards later acknowledged that he had voted as a senator from North Carolina in 2001 for the No Child Left Behind Act, an overhaul of education policy championed by President Bush that increased standardized testing and held schools more accountable for performance. When asked if he regretted his vote, he answered that he could not have known how Mr. Bush would carry out the program.
 ''There was no way to know because he didn't tell us the truth about whether he would fund it,'' he said. 
 Mr. Edwards did not address how he would pay for his plan.
 Many of his proposals track ideas advocated by Democrats in recent years.
 In addition to calling for making preschool available to all children, starting with those in the poorest areas, Mr. Edwards said he would support local partnerships to promote better health care and child care for young children. He said the federal government should help states retain new teachers, many of whom leave the profession after a few years. 
 Addressing one of the most criticized aspects of the No Child Left Behind law, he said he would overhaul the approach to standardized testing as a means of tracking the progress of students and schools.
 Rather than what his campaign called ''cheap standardized tests,'' Mr. Edwards's plan would develop ''higher-quality assessments that measure higher-order thinking skills, including open-ended essays, oral examinations, and projects and experiments.''
 Mr. Edwards made his education proposal at the end of a week in which his campaign expressed frustration with the attention being paid to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's health care plan.
 At a forum in Davenport, Iowa, on Thursday night, attended by five of the top Democratic candidates, Mr. Edwards and Mrs. Clinton both noted their health care plans, but Mr. Edwards fought to remind the audience that he introduced his own health care plan months ago.
 In an e-mail message to reporters, Eric Schultz, a spokesman for Mr. Edwards, on Friday morning called Mrs. Clinton's plan ''strikingly similar'' to the plan proposed by Mr. Edwards.

HEADLINE: Climate Week

 BODY:
The coming week could set a record for the number of high-profile hours spent discussing global warming and what to do about it. It begins with a special one-day session at the United Nations, at which Al Gore will press the case for strong collective action to stop the rise of greenhouse gases. It ends with a two-day White House ''summit'' involving all of the major emitters, including India and China. Both of those nations have been conspicuously absent from climate negotiations, but their help in arresting global emissions is essential. 
 The problem needs all the attention it can get. But if talk is good, it is also cheap. And it will change nothing unless it leads to a real treaty with real, and enforceable, limits on the production of greenhouse gases. That means a broader and more inclusive version of the Kyoto Protocol, a noble but flawed treaty that expires in 2012. 
 As we know, firm targets are not what President Bush has in mind. Mr. Bush announced this summit in June at a time when he was under serious pressure from scientists, the Supreme Court, his Europeans allies and the nation's governors to do something about global warming. He made it clear even then that he would continue to resist binding targets of the sort envisioned by Kyoto in favor of voluntary, country-by-country agreements -- ''aspirational'' goals, in the words of his environmental adviser, James Connaughton, instead of real ones. If this summit legitimizes an every-nation-for-itself approach, it will have been a failure.
 Nor should all the hoopla be allowed to obscure the fact that there are plenty of things that Washington can do, should do and is still not doing to start slowing the damage from global warming. 
 One obvious step is to let California and 13 other states proceed with stiff new rules aimed at reducing greenhouse gases from cars and light trucks. This month, a federal judge, William K. Sessions III, ruled that the states should be allowed to proceed. In doing so, he systematically demolished every technological and economic argument advanced by the automobile industry as to why it cannot significantly improve automobile efficiency. But the states still need a federal waiver to proceed. Mr. Bush should grant it.
 Meanwhile, Democratic leaders in the House and Senate should stop inventing endless excuses -- Iraq, a crowded calendar, procedural difficulties -- for why they cannot move swiftly to reconcile their two energy bills. 
 One of the big sticking points is a Senate provision requiring meaningful improvements in fuel economy. Again the automobile companies say they can't do it. History -- and Judge Sessions -- say they can.
 Energy bills are almost always controversial. This year's bills are more problematic than most because they contain some tough provisions requiring serious investment in efficiency and major changes in the way we create and deliver energy. This is a big test for Democrats. If they cannot deliver an energy bill, there's little hope they can ever handle the more complex, but essential, task of producing a comprehensive strategy on climate change.

HEADLINE: In '08 Campaign, Money Chase Circles the Globe

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER and MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
The intense pursuit of money in the presidential campaigns and the many wealthy Americans working at hedge funds and other businesses worldwide have led candidates to broaden fund-raising overseas, especially financial centers like London and Hong Kong. 
 This week, Rudolph W. Giuliani appeared at a fund-raiser at a hotel near Hyde Park in London. Mr. Giuliani is to be followed there next month by the spouses of Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois. This year, Mr. Obama joined financial supporters in Beijing via a videoconference to shake the overseas money tree. 
 Driven largely by Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Obama, contributions from American supporters in other countries are on pace to far exceed the sums raised overseas in the 2004 election. 
 By the end of June, the candidates had raised a combined total of $551,000 abroad, compared with $31,525 at the same point in 2003 and nearly $1 million for the entire election cycle. 
 The increase appears driven by factors like the ease of donating on the Internet, a diaspora among financial workers in an increasingly global economy and the unending needs of campaigns to cast as wide a net as possible. 
 ''Given the expense of American presidential elections, every fund-raising opportunity is important, and you've got to take advantage of it,'' Mr. Giuliani said after joining his donors for wine and salmon at the Mandarin Oriental in London. 
 Terry Nelson, a Republican strategist not working for any campaign, said that in previous elections a trip abroad might have been seen as too expensive and too taxing to be worth the journey. But, Mr. Nelson said, the hard and early charge of this political season may have changed that. 
 ''We are now in the third quarter of what has been a very aggressive fund-raising cycle by all of the candidates, and there are only so many times you can go back to New York to do another event,'' said Mr. Nelson, who worked on President Bush's re-election campaign and, until this summer, Senator John McCain's campaign. 
 Yet contributions from abroad continue to represent less than 1 percent of the total that the candidates have raised. 
 Raising money overseas is not without its perils. After the election in 1996, the Democratic Party and fund-raisers paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines after the Federal Election Commission ruled that the party had received more than $1 million in illegal contributions from Asians before the election.
 Although the situations are not parallel, Mrs. Clinton's opponents recently invoked the memory of that scandal when a major fund-raiser, Norman Hsu, who was born in Hong Kong, was arrested. 
 Federal prosecutors charged Mr. Hsu this week with bilking investors out of at least $60 million, some of which he used to reimburse contributors who made campaign donations at his request in violation of election law.
 About half the money raised overseas by presidential candidates through June was from addresses in Britain. The second biggest source was France, $41,000, followed by China, $37,000; Japan, $31,000; and Switzerland, $27,000. 
 The totals could run higher, because campaigns do not uniformly identify foreign contributions, and donors living abroad may list a United States address. 
 Mr. Obama, who has raised more money from abroad than all other candidates, $251,000, appears to benefit from a successful Internet operation. His Beijing videoconference appears to have been a success. He has collected nearly $25,000 from donors in China, the most of all candidates. 
 Mr. Giuliani had raised the second most from overseas, at $121,550, even before his fund-raiser this week. Most of that came from London finance executives, including $11,300 from executives of Elliott Advisers, the London affiliate of a company owned by Paul E. Singer, a hedge fund executive who has been a main supporter and adviser for Mr. Giuliani. 
 In June, Mr. Giuliani's London supporters gave a ''kickoff'' in which Mr. Giuliani participated using a videoconference. 
 The invitation to the London event showed an oddity of overseas fund-raising. Supporters were, of course, required to write checks of varying amounts depending on their interaction with the candidate. The invitation included an admonition in bold face type and capital letters to include with the R.S.V.P. a photocopy of a valid United States passport.
 Federal election regulations, intended to prevent foreigners from influencing elections and policy, require that campaigns inquire about the citizenship of any contributor whom a ''reasonable person'' would suspect of not being a United States citizen. 
 The regulations specify situations that require campaigns to inquire about citizenship, including the use a foreign passport, making the contribution from a foreign bank or living abroad. 
 The regulations, which were more narrowly defined in the campaign finance reform act of 2002, leave open large possibilities. A foreigner could conceivably list a United States address that is not his own and not face further scrutiny.
 Citizens of territories like American Samoa, Guam and the United States Virgin Islands fall into a middle ground. They cannot vote in presidential elections, but they can donate to presidential campaigns. And addresses from those places do not set off the requirement to ask about citizenship.
 To prevent embarrassment, many campaigns hire companies to check donors' backgrounds. Mr. Giuliani's campaign said it relied on CMDI of Falls Church, Va., to review donors from overseas and domestically. The company, which has also been retrained by Mr. Cain and Mitt Romney's campaigns, did not return telephone calls.
 The 90 donors at Mr. Giuliani's fund-raiser were required, if they had not already, to show their passports outside the ballroom. None seemed to mind.
 Tim Spangler, a lawyer and Republican activist who organized the event, said he had no trouble filling the 90 seats.
 ''My wife and I lived in New York throughout the 90s,'' when they became boosters of the mayor's, Mr. Spangler said. 
 ''He has tremendous support here,'' Mr. Spangler added.
 The invitation requested $1,000 donations for the luncheon, $2,300 for the luncheon and a photograph with Mr. Giuliani and a promise to raise $10,000 or more for a round-table with Mr. Giuliani.
 Under federal law, individuals can contribute up to $2,300 each for both the primary and general elections.
 Mr. Giuliani was joined on the stage by a granddaughter of Winston Churchill, Celia Sandys, surrounded by four American and four British flags. Ms. Sandys said Mr. Giuliani had been called ''Churchill in a baseball cap.''
 The two discussed leadership and the relationship between the United States and Britain before taking guests' questions. 
 Janet Evans, a lawyer who has lived for years in London, said she was a member of Republicans Abroad. Once a month, about 50 members in London meet in a bar in South Kensington to discuss politics, Ms. Evans said.
 She had heard about Mr. Giuliani's fund-raiser through the group. Although she has not committed to a candidate, she said, Mr. Giuliani made a favorable impression.
 ''If it is a run against Hillary,'' Ms. Evans said, ''I think he is the only one who can beat her, because he is moderate on the social issues.'' 
 Not everyone in attendance lived in London. Bruce S. Gelb, a longtime supporter of the mayor, flew from New York to support what he saw as an important trip, for the money and the symbolism.
 ''It is one way for him to make it clear he has one foot in America and another in the world,'' Mr. Gelb said.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 25, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about political fund-raising among Americans living abroad appeared to misstate the relationship between several Republican candidates and a company that checks donors' backgrounds. The company has been retained by the candidates, not retrained by them. Also because of an editing error, the article at one point misstated the surname of one of the candidates. He is John McCain, not Cain.

HEADLINE: When Markets Are Too Big to Fail

 BODY:
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. cautioned lawmakers this week about the pitfalls in one of Congress's key proposals to help defaulting homeowners. 
 Several lawmakers want to temporarily expand Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the big government-sponsored housing agencies, to allow for more mortgage lending and refinancings for homeowners facing foreclosure. Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson expressed concern that the economy could be harmed if the agencies took on too much risk and then, by some calamity, needed a government bailout. Any larger role, they warned, would have to be accompanied by clear rules and strict oversight. 
 We support expanding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and don't have a problem with carefully regulating their activities. What is unacceptable is that neither Mr. Bernanke nor Mr. Paulson has called for new rules to constrain excessive risk-taking in the financial markets -- activities like creating and selling securities backed by utterly reckless loans -- even though those risks have greatly contributed to the markets' instability and have repeatedly required government intervention. 
 The worthy goal of the Fed's recent interventions -- including this week's half a percentage point interest rate cut -- is to prevent disruptions in the financial markets from harming the broader economy. But they come with considerable risk. The rate cut, for instance, could backfire, unleashing inflation for reasons not entirely within the Fed's control. 
 When it comes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the presumed government backing is called an ''implicit guarantee.'' On Wall Street, it has many names -- ex-post insurance, a Greenspan put, or now, a Bernanke put. Whatever you call it, its existence demands that markets be subject to adequate rules and oversight. 
 That's clearly not the case at present. Hedge funds and private equity firms, which are allowed to operate largely in secret, need to be subject to more official scrutiny so that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have a grasp of their activities before big problems occur and so that investors affected by their actions can better assess the risks they're taking. Regulators must develop and coordinate a system for staying on top of the overlapping instruments and transactions that fuel market activity.
 Currently, regulators can't even decide if the derivatives at the heart of so much of today's instability are securities, which would fall under the purview of the securities' regulators, or futures contracts, the purview of commodities' regulators. 
 It is possible to strike a balance between monitoring markets and protecting proprietary information, between fostering innovation and curbing excessive risk-taking that all Americans end up on the hook for. Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson should be leading the way. If they won't, Congress and the next administration have their work cut out for them.

HEADLINE: Rice Says Paris Agrees On Pressing The Iranians

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
The United States and France agree on increasing diplomatic and economic pressure to force Iran to abandon its nuclear program, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Friday as the Bush administration played host to a meeting of major world powers to discuss another round of United Nations sanctions.
 ''I think it's first important to note that we have set out a diplomatic path that includes negotiation as the preferred means by which to resolve this issue,'' Ms. Rice said at a joint news conference with her French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner. 
 On Sunday, Mr. Kouchner kicked up a small diplomatic storm when he raised the possibility of war with Iran. He subsequently moderated his statements and dropped references to war. Ms. Rice noted that a diplomatic league of the five permanent Security Council members plus Germany had offered ''a very, very good package of initiatives that Iran could take up if it wished to stop its enrichment and reprocessing activity.'' 
 But she said, ''We will seek further resolutions in the U.N. Security Council should Iran not take up the negotiating track.''
 Toward that end, the Foreign Ministry political directors from Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia met at the State Department on Friday with R. Nicholas Burns, the United States under secretary of state for political affairs, to press ahead on a possible third Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on Iran. After the meeting, Mr. Burns issued a statement on behalf of the six officials that ''reaffirmed their commitment to maintain a dual-track approach on Iran's nuclear activities.''
 The discussions on Friday ''were serious and constructive,'' the statement said. The officials ''had a detailed discussion of the elements of a new United Nations Security Council resolution, as well as possibilities of continued dialogue with Iran.''
 Supporters of new sanctions were buoyed by a decision at the conclusion of Friday's meeting to schedule another working session next week. That meeting is ''to prepare recommendations'' for a high-level conference next Friday, at which Ms. Rice and her five ministerial counterparts will discuss the potential for a new sanctions resolution.
 Although senior officials from all six nations involved in the sanctions talks agreed on the urgency of preventing Iran from going nuclear, deep disagreements remained over the speed of imposing new sanctions, and on how deeply they should cut into the Iranian economy.
 Russia and China are the most reluctant to move ahead, while the United States is pushing for faster action. Iranian officials say their nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.
 In her public comments on Friday, Ms. Rice said that Paris and Washington were in consensus on Iran. ''I think that there is essentially no difference in the way that we see the situation in Iran and what the international community must do, and we are going to work toward that, toward that end,'' she said. 
 American efforts to push for more sanctions appear to have been aided by France's new leadership under President Nicolas Sarkozy, who has taken a stance on Iran much closer to Washington's hawkish policy views than that of his predecessor, Jacques Chirac.
 That is why special attention was being paid in Washington this week to the words chosen by Mr. Kouchner, the French foreign minister and co-founder of Doctors Without Borders, whose background in the humanitarian world made his remarks about the possibility of war all the more startling. He chose his words carefully on Friday, stressing the need for exploring all diplomatic avenues. Italy on Friday joined those urging more sanctions against Iran.
 ''There is still room for a strong initiative that can on one end put pressure through sanctions, even more severe sanctions, and on the other end really offer the possibility for negotiations and agreement,'' Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema said in an interview on Italian state television, according to news service reports from Rome.

HEADLINE: The Emergence of Bush, the Budget Warrior

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
George W. Bush ran for the White House as a compassionate conservative. Now he is portraying himself as a conservative of a different stripe -- the fiscal kind.
 Mr. Bush is headed into a spending battle with Congressional Democrats with the two branches of government as divided on the issue as they have been since the federal shutdown of 1995. The president has threatened to veto 10 of the 11 appropriations bills that have passed the House, as well as legislation expanding a popular children's health care program. On Monday, he will step up the fight with a speech accusing Democrats of fiscal irresponsibility.
 That might not sound altogether unexpected, given that Democrats, whom Mr. Bush accuses of ''working to bring back the failed tax-and-spend policies of the past,'' now run Congress. But the president's new tough talk on spending has also caught some fiscal conservatives in his own party off guard. After years lambasting Mr. Bush for letting government spending run out of control, they wonder what has gotten into him.
 ''I don't know what kind of epiphany he had,'' said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who fought on Capitol Hill to rein in the federal budget, to little avail. ''I'm just glad he had it.'' 
 It is a conversion, whether driven by newfound principle or changing circumstances, that has undeniable political benefits for a president struggling to reassert his authority when his standing even within his own party is under attack. 
 White House officials say Mr. Bush has not changed his stripes. ''There is no epiphany,'' Tony Fratto, the deputy White House press secretary, said. ''We have been fiscal conservatives throughout this administration.''
 But experts at two research institutions that support smaller government -- the Cato Institute, which has a libertarian bent, and the Heritage Foundation, a proponent of conservative economic policies -- say the White House has not been nearly conservative enough.
 While there may be explanations for higher spending, including the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Brian M. Reidl of Heritage says the federal budget has nonetheless grown at a rate of 7 percent a year under Mr. Bush, about twice the 3.5 percent rate under Bill Clinton.
 Chris Edwards of Cato says federal outlays, when adjusted for inflation, have increased faster under Mr. Bush than under any president since Jimmy Carter. ''When he gives speeches now, you hear him bashing the Democrats on overspending,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''It sounds ridiculous, because we know he's a big spender.''
 The names Reidl and Edwards may not be household words, but the name of another prominent critic of Mr. Bush's spending policies -- Alan Greenspan -- is.
 Mr. Greenspan rattled the White House this week with his new memoir, ''The Age of Turbulence,'' in which he accused the president of fiscal recklessness. Mr. Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, argued the president put Republican politics, and the desire of lawmakers to steer tax dollars to their districts, ahead of sound fiscal policy. 
 In an unusually public airing of differences, Vice President Dick Cheney struck back at Mr. Greenspan on the op-ed page of The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, issuing what he called ''gentle reminders'' asserting that the administration had a strong record of fiscal prudence. At a news conference Thursday, Mr. Bush brushed off Mr. Greenspan's criticism. 
 ''My feelings are not hurt,'' the president said.
 The federal budget was running a surplus when Mr. Clinton left office and was projected to reduce the national debt over a number of years, putting the government in a better fiscal position to deal with the looming costs from the aging of the baby boom generation.
 The economic expansion of the 1990s ended, reducing the growth of tax revenue at the very time that Mr. Bush was pushing a long-term tax cut through Congress. Then came the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which imposed new spending demands on the government. 
 Military and domestic security spending shot up. Experts say those increases, coupled with Mr. Bush's tax cuts, helped drive up the federal deficit, which peaked at $413 billion in 2004. It has since narrowed to a projected $170 billion for this year, the result of an improving economy and rising tax revenues. 
 But both Mr. Reidl and Mr. Edwards say that even so-called nonmilitary discretionary spending -- the portion of the budget that a president can rein in, because it does not go to entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid -- has grown faster under Mr. Bush than Mr. Clinton. (To the consternation of many conservatives, Mr. Bush also signed into a law a major expansion of Medicare, adding prescription drug coverage for retirees.)
 When Republicans ran Congress, Mr. Bush never vetoed a spending bill, despite calls for him to do so from fiscal conservatives, including Jim Nussle, the former chairman of the House Budget Committee who has just become Mr. Bush's new budget director. Peter Wehner, a former domestic policy adviser to Mr. Bush, says the president sometimes deferred to the House speaker at the time, J. Dennis Hastert.
 ''I think to some extent you're seeing a liberated George Bush,'' Mr. Wehner said, discussing the current spate of veto threats. ''When Hastert was speaker, one of his red lines was that he did not want any spending bills vetoed. That, to some extent, restricted the range of actions that we had. It made it difficult to veto certain bills like the transportation bill and the other ones conservatives didn't want.''
 Others see Mr. Bush reacting to Republican losses in the midterm elections of 2006. 
 ''All of us are smarting from the lessons of 2006, and while people are right to point to factors like the war and scandal, I hold the view that the biggest scandal in Washington, D.C., was runaway federal spending under Republican control,'' said Representative Mike Pence, Republican of Indiana.
 The White House explains the new veto threats by saying Republicans met the president's spending limits, while the Democrats, whose proposed 2009 budget exceeds Mr. Bush's by $22 billion, have not.
 Democrats respond that the White House is being hypocritical in accusing them of fiscal irresponsibility. ''If he was interested in fiscal discipline, he should have started $3 trillion ago,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.
 And Mr. Reidl says Democrats have simply been more straightforward about their plans to spend the taxpayers' money. They also have been willing to consider tax increases to cover them.
 By contrast, Mr. Reidl added, Republicans drove up spending through ''loopholes and gimmicks'' like tucking extra money into emergency spending bills.
 Historians say there is nothing like a good spending fight with Congress to boost a president's sagging fortunes. When Republicans shut down the government in late 1995, Mr. Clinton emerged the winner. So perhaps it should come as no surprise that, with just 16 months left in office and his approval ratings still crushed by the war in Iraq, Mr. Bush is putting up his fiscal dukes.
 ''In any kind of showdown with Congress, he does have the upper hand, because veto overrides are dauntingly difficult to achieve,'' said Ross K. Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University. ''It could conceivably mean racking up some victories for a president who desperately needs them.''
 Just how the spending impasse will be resolved is unclear.Both Democrats and White House officials say they want to avoid a shutdown. But conservatives are certainly happy to see their president taking on the fight.
 ''I think it will be good for the country, I think it will be good for the president and I think it will be good for the Republican Party,'' Mr. Pence said. ''I'm all for it. Let's rock 'n' roll.''

HEADLINE: Dollars Still Not Equal at Canada's Cash Registers

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
Elene Fromanger saw little evidence of the Canadian dollar's new might when she went shopping for health care books on Friday afternoon.
 All of them were marked with separate prices for Canada and the United States. With the Canadian dollar now at par with the United States currency, no calculator was needed to discover that Ms. Fromanger paid $18 more before sales tax than an American shopper would have for the same three books.
 ''It's ridiculous,'' she said outside a downtown Ottawa bookstore. ''They still charge more, but the dollar has been going up for two years. I find it inexcusable.'' 
 Canadians may now be wealthier in global terms, but the even exchange rate with the United States dollar now makes it immediately obvious that they also pay more than Americans for many goods. 
 A report released Thursday by BMO Nesbitt Burns, a unit of the Bank of Montreal, estimates that products are priced 24 percent higher in Canada than in the United States despite the Canadian dollar's steady five-year march to parity with the United States dollar.
 During the three-decade slump from which the Canadian dollar just rebounded, Canadians became accustomed to paying more.
 Not all price differences are a result of exchange rates. Some agricultural products, including milk, chicken and eggs, are produced under supply-management systems. Those closed markets maintain farm incomes but also elevate prices for Canadian shoppers.
 And for marketing reasons, many companies absorbed the currency differences when the exchange rate was less favorable. Even when the Canadian dollar traded well below American currency, for example, songs on Apple Canada's iTunes stores sold for 99 Canadian cents.
 But as Canadians once again start comparing American and Canadian prices, two products stand out: books and automobiles.
 Despite the Canadian dollar's rise, the price gap for high-end cars is sharp. In the United States, the base price for a 2008 BMW 550i sedan is $59,275. In Canada, the same car starts at 82,900 Canadian dollars. The difference, 23,625, is slightly more than the Canadian price of a Volkswagen Rabbit hatchback with an automatic transmission.
 ''I wish I could sell cars at the same price as in the U.S., but we happen to be in a very expensive country to do business in and we happen to live next door to the world's biggest and most competitive market,'' said Lindsay Duffield, the president and chief executive of BMW Canada. ''We price to the market. We're very competitive to our competitors here and our prices compared to the U.K. or Germany are low.''
 Despite popular Canadian perceptions, however, the large differences in luxury models may not be reflected in the automobile market as a whole. In his annual Canadian price review, Dennis DesRosiers, an automotive analyst based in Richmond Hill, Ontario, found a price difference of only $1,000 on the cars that account for about two-thirds of Canadian sales. 
 A potential savings of $1,000 is not enough to motivate most buyers to deal with the bureaucratic and technical hurdles involved in importing a car from the United States.
 ''For the vast percentage of cars and trucks being purchased by Canadians, the vehicle companies are not ripping Canadians off,'' Mr. DesRosiers wrote.
 As Ms. Fromanger's shopping trip demonstrates, the anger toward book publishers largely stems from the fact that theirs is one of a small number of products, including newspapers and magazines, that typically display prices for Canada and the United States.
 ''We're always the lightning rod when the dollar goes up or down,'' said Dave Hill, the manager of Munro's Books of Victoria, a large independently owned shop in Victoria, British Columbia. ''But it's a lot more complicated issue than the customers perceive.''
 Mr. Hill was among the booksellers that started pushing publishers for price cuts about three years ago when the Canadian dollar was clearly heading upward. On the whole, he said, the industry has been responsive.
 Random House of Canada, one of the largest publishers and distributors in the country, has given Munro's what Mr. Hill called ''extra margin'' on many titles. As a result, the store has posted signs indicating that books from that publisher will be discounted by 10 percent.
 A random review of new titles shows that they are generally 15 percent to 20 percent higher in Canada, in part a reflection of the higher distribution and marketing costs of a smaller market. Older titles, however, still show much larger differences. At the store where Ms. Fromanger shopped, the hardcover edition of ''The Da Vinci Code'' by Dan Brown sells for 37.95 Canadian dollars but has a United States price of $24.95.
 Diane J. Brisebois, the president of the Retail Council of Canada, said Canadian shoppers should be patient.
 The merchandise now on the shelves and racks in most stores, she said, was ordered and priced at wholesale earlier this year, when the Canadian dollar was worth about 15 percent less than it is now relative to the United States dollar. 
 But she also cautioned that price differences reflect more than just one exchange rate. Economies of scale, different tax and cost structures, and exchange rates with third countries all play a role, she said.
 ''For Canadians to believe that our prices will be at par with American prices under any circumstances is not realistic,'' Ms. Brisebois said. ''Americans have 10 times the purchasing power. That's the reality.''

HEADLINE: Citing Debt, Rell Vows To Veto Bond Bill

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE STUART

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
Gov. M. Jodi Rell said on Friday that she would veto the legislature's $4.6 billion bond package for projects like school construction and transportation improvements, calling it ''unaffordable for the people of Connecticut.'' 
 She said that the state was already in debt and that approving $4.6 billion in borrowing -- even to address some worthy needs -- would send the wrong message to credit-rating agencies and municipalities. 
 ''The simple fact is the Bond Commission really is Connecticut's credit card, and we are over the limit,'' Mrs. Rell, a Republican, said, explaining that Connecticut had the third-highest bonded debt per person in the United States. 
 But leaders of the Democratic-controlled legislature had a different take on Mrs. Rell's veto threat. 
 ''No bonding takes place without the governor's approval, yet she continues to try to blame the legislature,'' the speaker of the House, James A. Amann of Milford, said in an e-mail message. ''We could put a trillion dollars in the bond package, but ultimately it is only a menu that the governor gets to choose from. Frankly, she has been selecting more than one entree and leaving scraps for legislators.'' 
 The Senate majority leader, Donald E. Williams Jr. of Brooklyn, Conn., said Mrs. Rell had not officially vetoed the bonding bill because it had not reached her desk. Until then, Mr. Williams said, he would attempt to get her to reconsider. 
 Mr. Williams said he challenged the governor to find a bond-rating company to say it would lower the state's credit rating for approving the $4.6 billion. He said it was the legislature's prerogative to authorize the money and the governor's prerogative to allocate it as head of the state's Bond Commission. 
 The Bond Commission, controlled by Mrs. Rell, is the only body empowered to borrow money for these projects. Lawmakers failed this year in their attempt to pass legislation to force the governor to share the authority of the commission with leaders of the House and the Senate. 
 Mrs. Rell, who paints herself as a fiscal conservative, said she was not against a majority of the projects, like $1.35 billion for school construction and $850 million for transportation improvements. 
 To have some of the local school construction projects approved, Mrs. Rell called the General Assembly back into special session next week. 
 One problem she has with the package is more than $230 million in what she has called ''pork'' projects, like skateboard parks, downtown development efforts, streetscape improvements and block-party programs. 
 ''Legislators are not telling folks back home this is a wish list and it may not see the light of day,'' Mrs. Rell said at a news conference Friday morning. 
 The Senate minority leader, John McKinney of Southport, said legislators often approved the bond package to tell their constituents they were able to get a local project approved in the state budget ''when they know they haven't been promised the money.'' 
 In his e-mail message, Mr. Amann described the process for financing specific local projects as essential. ''Earmarks are about an open democracy where elected officials take responsibility for the projects they work for,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Education And Schools Are a Focus For Edwards

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
The Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards laid out a proposal on Friday to overhaul the education system, saying that the current No Child Left Behind law was not working and that poor children were still being sent to schools that are ''separate and unequal.''
 Speaking at Brody Middle School here, Mr. Edwards outlined a plan that he said would evaluate students more effectively, reduce class sizes and reward teachers who work in high-poverty schools with up to $15,000 in incentive pay, initiatives similar to those championed by education officials in New York City and elsewhere. 
 He also called for universal preschool, the creation of a national university that would become a ''West Point for teachers'' and an initiative that uses what he described as ''education SWAT teams'' to sweep in and rebuild failing schools. 
 ''First, every child should be prepared to succeed when they show up in the classroom,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''Second, every classroom should be led by an excellent teacher. And third, every teacher should work in an outstanding school. These three principles should guide our reform.''
 He revived his campaign slogan of what he calls the ''two Americas,'' applying it to racial and economic disparities in education.
 ''More than a half-century after Brown v. Board of Education, we still have two school systems, separate and unequal,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''There are nearly 1,000 high schools where more than half of the students won't graduate -- they're called 'dropout factories.' '' 
 Mr. Edwards later acknowledged that he had voted as a senator from North Carolina in 2001 for the No Child Left Behind Act, an overhaul of education policy championed by President Bush that increased standardized testing and held schools more accountable for performance. When asked if he regretted his vote, he answered that he could not have known how Mr. Bush would carry out the program.
 ''There was no way to know because he didn't tell us the truth about whether he would fund it,'' he said. 
 Mr. Edwards did not address how he would pay for his plan.
 Many of his proposals track ideas advocated by Democrats in recent years.
 In addition to calling for making preschool available to all children, starting with those in the poorest areas, Mr. Edwards said he would support local partnerships to promote better health care and child care for young children. He said the federal government should help states retain new teachers, many of whom leave the profession after a few years. 
 Addressing one of the most criticized aspects of the No Child Left Behind law, he said he would overhaul the approach to standardized testing as a means of tracking the progress of students and schools.
 Rather than what his campaign called ''cheap standardized tests,'' Mr. Edwards's plan would develop ''higher-quality assessments that measure higher-order thinking skills, including open-ended essays, oral examinations, and projects and experiments.''
 Mr. Edwards made his education proposal at the end of a week in which his campaign expressed frustration with the attention being paid to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's health care plan.
 At a forum in Davenport, Iowa, on Thursday night, attended by five of the top Democratic candidates, Mr. Edwards and Mrs. Clinton both noted their health care plans, but Mr. Edwards fought to remind the audience that he introduced his own health care plan months ago.
 In an e-mail message to reporters, Eric Schultz, a spokesman for Mr. Edwards, on Friday morning called Mrs. Clinton's plan ''strikingly similar'' to the plan proposed by Mr. Edwards.

HEADLINE: Climate Week

 BODY:
The coming week could set a record for the number of high-profile hours spent discussing global warming and what to do about it. It begins with a special one-day session at the United Nations, at which Al Gore will press the case for strong collective action to stop the rise of greenhouse gases. It ends with a two-day White House ''summit'' involving all of the major emitters, including India and China. Both of those nations have been conspicuously absent from climate negotiations, but their help in arresting global emissions is essential. 
 The problem needs all the attention it can get. But if talk is good, it is also cheap. And it will change nothing unless it leads to a real treaty with real, and enforceable, limits on the production of greenhouse gases. That means a broader and more inclusive version of the Kyoto Protocol, a noble but flawed treaty that expires in 2012. 
 As we know, firm targets are not what President Bush has in mind. Mr. Bush announced this summit in June at a time when he was under serious pressure from scientists, the Supreme Court, his Europeans allies and the nation's governors to do something about global warming. He made it clear even then that he would continue to resist binding targets of the sort envisioned by Kyoto in favor of voluntary, country-by-country agreements -- ''aspirational'' goals, in the words of his environmental adviser, James Connaughton, instead of real ones. If this summit legitimizes an every-nation-for-itself approach, it will have been a failure.
 Nor should all the hoopla be allowed to obscure the fact that there are plenty of things that Washington can do, should do and is still not doing to start slowing the damage from global warming. 
 One obvious step is to let California and 13 other states proceed with stiff new rules aimed at reducing greenhouse gases from cars and light trucks. This month, a federal judge, William K. Sessions III, ruled that the states should be allowed to proceed. In doing so, he systematically demolished every technological and economic argument advanced by the automobile industry as to why it cannot significantly improve automobile efficiency. But the states still need a federal waiver to proceed. Mr. Bush should grant it.
 Meanwhile, Democratic leaders in the House and Senate should stop inventing endless excuses -- Iraq, a crowded calendar, procedural difficulties -- for why they cannot move swiftly to reconcile their two energy bills. 
 One of the big sticking points is a Senate provision requiring meaningful improvements in fuel economy. Again the automobile companies say they can't do it. History -- and Judge Sessions -- say they can.
 Energy bills are almost always controversial. This year's bills are more problematic than most because they contain some tough provisions requiring serious investment in efficiency and major changes in the way we create and deliver energy. This is a big test for Democrats. If they cannot deliver an energy bill, there's little hope they can ever handle the more complex, but essential, task of producing a comprehensive strategy on climate change.

HEADLINE: In '08 Campaign, Money Chase Circles the Globe

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER and MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
 The intense pursuit of money in the presidential campaigns and the many wealthy Americans working at hedge funds and other businesses worldwide have led candidates to broaden fund-raising overseas, especially financial centers like London and Hong Kong. 
 This week, Rudolph W. Giuliani appeared at a fund-raiser at a hotel near Hyde Park in London. Mr. Giuliani is to be followed there next month by the spouses of Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois. This year, Mr. Obama joined financial supporters in Beijing via a videoconference to shake the overseas money tree. 
 Driven largely by Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Obama, contributions from American supporters in other countries are on pace to far exceed the sums raised overseas in the 2004 election. 
 By the end of June, the candidates had raised a combined total of $551,000 abroad, compared with $31,525 at the same point in 2003 and nearly $1 million for the entire election cycle. 
 The increase appears driven by factors like the ease of donating on the Internet, a diaspora among financial workers in an increasingly global economy and the unending needs of campaigns to cast as wide a net as possible. 
 ''Given the expense of American presidential elections, every fund-raising opportunity is important, and you've got to take advantage of it,'' Mr. Giuliani said after joining his donors for wine and salmon at the Mandarin Oriental in London. 
 Terry Nelson, a Republican strategist not working for any campaign, said that in previous elections a trip abroad might have been seen as too expensive and too taxing to be worth the journey. But, Mr. Nelson said, the hard and early charge of this political season may have changed that. 
 ''We are now in the third quarter of what has been a very aggressive fund-raising cycle by all of the candidates, and there are only so many times you can go back to New York to do another event,'' said Mr. Nelson, who worked on President Bush's re-election campaign and, until this summer, Senator John McCain's campaign. 
 Yet contributions from abroad continue to represent less than 1 percent of the total that the candidates have raised. 
 Raising money overseas is not without its perils. After the election in 1996, the Democratic Party and fund-raisers paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines after the Federal Election Commission ruled that the party had received more than $1 million in illegal contributions from Asians before the election.
 Although the situations are not parallel, Mrs. Clinton's opponents recently invoked the memory of that scandal when a major fund-raiser, Norman Hsu, who was born in Hong Kong, was arrested. 
 Federal prosecutors charged Mr. Hsu this week with bilking investors out of at least $60 million, some of which he used to reimburse contributors who made campaign donations at his request in violation of election law.
 About half the money raised overseas by presidential candidates through June was from addresses in Britain. The second biggest source was France, $41,000, followed by China, $37,000; Japan, $31,000; and Switzerland, $27,000. 
 The totals could run higher, because campaigns do not uniformly identify foreign contributions, and donors living abroad may list a United States address. 
 Mr. Obama, who has raised more money from abroad than all other candidates, $251,000, appears to benefit from a successful Internet operation. His Beijing videoconference appears to have been a success. He has collected nearly $25,000 from donors in China, the most of all candidates. 
 Mr. Giuliani had raised the second most from overseas, at $121,550, even before his fund-raiser this week. Most of that came from London finance executives, including $11,300 from executives of Elliott Advisers, the London affiliate of a company owned by Paul E. Singer, a hedge fund executive who has been a main supporter and adviser for Mr. Giuliani. 
 In June, Mr. Giuliani's London supporters gave a ''kickoff'' in which Mr. Giuliani participated using a videoconference. 
 The invitation to the London event showed an oddity of overseas fund-raising. Supporters were, of course, required to write checks of varying amounts depending on their interaction with the candidate. The invitation included an admonition in bold face type and capital letters to include with the R.S.V.P. a photocopy of a valid United States passport.
 Federal election regulations, intended to prevent foreigners from influencing elections and policy, require that campaigns inquire about the citizenship of any contributor whom a ''reasonable person'' would suspect of not being a United States citizen. 
 The regulations specify situations that require campaigns to inquire about citizenship, including the use a foreign passport, making the contribution from a foreign bank or living abroad. 
 The regulations, which were more narrowly defined in the campaign finance reform act of 2002, leave open large possibilities. A foreigner could conceivably list a United States address that is not his own and not face further scrutiny.
 Citizens of territories like American Samoa, Guam and the United States Virgin Islands fall into a middle ground. They cannot vote in presidential elections, but they can donate to presidential campaigns. And addresses from those places do not set off the requirement to ask about citizenship.
 To prevent embarrassment, many campaigns hire companies to check donors' backgrounds. Mr. Giuliani's campaign said it relied on CMDI of Falls Church, Va., to review donors from overseas and domestically. The company, which has also been retained by Mr. McCain and Mitt Romney's campaigns, did not return telephone calls.
 The 90 donors at Mr. Giuliani's fund-raiser were required, if they had not already, to show their passports outside the ballroom. None seemed to mind.
 Tim Spangler, a lawyer and Republican activist who organized the event, said he had no trouble filling the 90 seats.
 ''My wife and I lived in New York throughout the 90s,'' when they became boosters of the mayor's, Mr. Spangler said. 
 ''He has tremendous support here,'' Mr. Spangler added.
 The invitation requested $1,000 donations for the luncheon, $2,300 for the luncheon and a photograph with Mr. Giuliani and a promise to raise $10,000 or more for a round-table with Mr. Giuliani.
 Under federal law, individuals can contribute up to $2,300 each for both the primary and general elections.
 Mr. Giuliani was joined on the stage by a granddaughter of Winston Churchill, Celia Sandys, surrounded by four American and four British flags. Ms. Sandys said Mr. Giuliani had been called ''Churchill in a baseball cap.''
 The two discussed leadership and the relationship between the United States and Britain before taking guests' questions. 
 Janet Evans, a lawyer who has lived for years in London, said she was a member of Republicans Abroad. Once a month, about 50 members in London meet in a bar in South Kensington to discuss politics, Ms. Evans said.
 She had heard about Mr. Giuliani's fund-raiser through the group. Although she has not committed to a candidate, she said, Mr. Giuliani made a favorable impression.
 ''If it is a run against Hillary,'' Ms. Evans said, ''I think he is the only one who can beat her, because he is moderate on the social issues.'' 
 Not everyone in attendance lived in London. Bruce S. Gelb, a longtime supporter of the mayor, flew from New York to support what he saw as an important trip, for the money and the symbolism.
 ''It is one way for him to make it clear he has one foot in America and another in the world,'' Mr. Gelb said.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 25, 2007

 CORRECTION:
 Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about political fund-raising among Americans living abroad appeared to misstate the relationship between several Republican candidates and a company that checks donors' backgrounds. The company has been retained by the candidates, not retrained by them. Also because of an editing error, the article at one point misstated the surname of one of the candidates. He is John McCain, not Cain.

HEADLINE: Dollar Sinks the Lowest Since It Started to Float

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
A DOLLAR bill won't buy what it used to. The greenback is worth less than ever before in this age of flexible exchange rates, and it has declined faster during the Bush administration than in any president's term since Richard M. Nixon severed the dollar's ties to gold in 1971. 
 This week, the euro traded above $1.40 for the first time, and the Canadian dollar climbed back to parity with the American dollar for the first time in 30 years.
 The chart shows the performance of the trade-weighted dollar index, as maintained by the Federal Reserve. Measured against a basket of currencies that has occasionally been updated by the Fed, the dollar is now almost 40 percent below its level in early 1971. 
 It has been a bumpy ride. The dollar suffered badly in the 1970s, particularly during Jimmy Carter's administration, when inflation seemed to be getting out of control. But it then soared in the early 1980s, in response to higher interest rates. It sank again as rates fell, but recovered during the economic strength of the late 1990s. Now the index has fallen below the lows set in 1995. 
 The chart also shows the index's compound annual change in each president's administration.
 Not all the moves can be explained by the dollar's strength or weakness, of course. The relative attractiveness of other currencies has varied. Under President Bush, the dollar has almost held its own against the yen, as the Japanese government has feared a strong yen could damage the country's exports.
 Still, during the Bush administration, the dollar has fallen against each of the five currencies shown -- the euro, the yen, the British pound, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. It also is down against the two currencies in the index -- the Swiss franc and the Swedish krona -- that are not shown. 
 Over all, the dollar index has fallen at a rate of 4.8 percent a year in this administration, considerably more than the previous record of 2.7 percent a year, during the Carter administration. Mr. Bush is the first president not to show a gain against any of the currencies in this index. 
 One important currency -- the Chinese yuan -- is excluded because the index tracks only freely traded currencies. The Chinese government has allowed its currency to advance slowly against the dollar, but not by as much as the Bush administration wants, and the American trade deficit with China has soared.
 Early in the Bush administration, officials maintained they were following a strong-dollar policy. Of late, that is not a phrase heard very often.

HEADLINE: Fed Governor Warns Against Shielding Investors From Their Losses

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
A Federal Reserve governor, Kevin M. Warsh, said yesterday that the central bank should be ''extremely wary'' of protecting banks or investors from losses resulting from the sell-off in credit markets. 
 ''The desire for well-functioning markets does not require us to insulate asset prices or individual financial institutions from the buffeting of the marketplace,'' Mr. Warsh said in remarks to the School of Business at the State University of New York at Albany. ''We should be extremely wary of protecting financial institutions and their various stakeholders from incurring losses.''
 Policy makers said when they cut interest rates this week that the move was taken ''to help forestall some of the adverse effects'' of financial disruptions on the broader economy, rather than to rescue investors. The Fed's half-point reduction in the benchmark rate was the biggest in five years.
 Remarks by the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke; the vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn; and Mr. Warsh in the last two days suggest that Fed officials are sensitive to criticism that they cut rates in response to mounting losses in credit markets.
 ''We have always focused sharply on the macroeconomy,'' Mr. Kohn said in a speech in Frankfurt yesterday. He said asset prices mattered because they ''have mattered for our outlook.''
 He said inflation expectations were less volatile in countries with central banks that have numerical targets for price gains, suggesting that his doubts about the practice have eased. ''For me the case remains open,'' he said.
 While there is little evidence that adopting a target directly influences how fast the public expects prices to rise, he said, ''I am relatively more persuaded that inflation targeting helps reduce the variance of inflation expectations.''
 Mr. Kohn and Mr. Bernanke have differed on the benefits of setting an inflation goal, and yesterday's remarks come as the central bank reviews how it conveys its policy objectives. For more than a year, Mr. Kohn, who said he was ''skeptical'' about a price target four years ago, has been chairman of a subcommittee of officials coordinating work on communication.
 This week, the Federal Open Market Committee cut the target rate for overnight loans between banks to 4.75 percent, the first reduction since 2003. 
 Mr. Kohn also said this week's cut in interest rates was intended to ''forestall'' adverse effects on the economy from the tumult in financial markets.
 ''I doubt policy would have been eased this week if housing prices had continued their upward march,'' he said.
 Mr. Warsh argued in his remarks that subprime mortgages did not contaminate other debt markets so much as they caused a reassessment of risk.

HEADLINE: In 2008, Bush v. Gore Redux?

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Right now it's just a petition drive on its way to becoming a ballot initiative in California. But you should think of it as a tropical depression that could develop into a major storm that blows away the Democrats' chances of winning the White House next year.
 And it could become a constitutional crisis. 
 It's panic time in Republican circles. The G.O.P. could go into next year's election burdened by the twin demons of an unpopular war and an economic downturn. The party that took the White House in 2000 while losing the popular vote figures it may have to do it again.
 The Presidential Election Reform Act is the name of a devious proposal that Republican operatives have dreamed up to siphon off 20 or more of the 55 electoral votes that the Democrats would get if, as expected, they win California in 2008.
 That's a lot of electoral votes, the equivalent of winning the state of Ohio. If this proposed change makes it onto the ballot and becomes law, those 20 or so electoral votes could well be enough to hand the White House to a Republican candidate who loses the popular vote nationwide.
 Even Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, has suggested that the initiative is a form of dirty pool. While not explicitly opposing it, Mr. Schwarzenegger said it smacks of changing the rules ''in the middle of the game.''
 Democrats are saying it's unconstitutional.
 The proposal would rewrite the rules for the distribution of electoral votes in California. Under current law, all of California's 55 electoral votes go to the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote statewide. That ''winner-take-all'' system is the norm in the U.S.
 Under the proposed change, electoral votes would be apportioned according to the winner of the popular vote in each of California's Congressional districts. That would likely throw 20 or more electoral votes to the Republican candidate, even if the Democrat carries the state.
 A sign of the bad faith in this proposal is the fact that there is no similar effort by the G.O.P. to apportion electoral votes by Congressional districts in, for example, Texas, a state with 34 electoral votes that is likely to go Republican next year.
 Longtime observers in California believe the proponents of this change -- lawyers with close ties to the Republican Party statewide and nationally -- will have no trouble collecting enough signatures to get it on the ballot in June. The first poll taken on the measure, which is not yet widely understood by voters, showed that it would pass.
 Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor and one of the nation's pre-eminent constitutional scholars, believes the initiative is blatantly unconstitutional. ''Entirely apart from the politics,'' he said, ''this clearly violates Article II of the Constitution, which very explicitly requires that the electors for president be selected 'in such manner as the Legislature' of the state directs.''
 In Mr. Tribe's view, the ''one and only way'' for California to change the manner in which its electoral votes are apportioned is through an act of the State Legislature.
 Professor Tribe is not a disinterested party. He represented Al Gore in the disputed 2000 presidential election. And not all constitutional experts agree that this would be such an easy call. ''This is not an open-and-shut case,'' said Richard Pildes, a professor at the New York University School of Law.
 What is undisputed is that the Democrats will mount a ferocious legal challenge if the ballot initiative passes -- ''maybe even before it has a chance to pass,'' a Democratic source said yesterday -- thus opening the door to an ugly constitutional fight reminiscent of Bush v. Gore in 2000.
 The potential for trouble in the event of a close election is huge. Said Professor Tribe: ''This is really a prescription for a possible constitutional crisis in which we have one president if California electors act in accord with the method set out by the State Legislature, and another president if the electors are divided according to this ballot initiative.''
 The operatives behind the initiative are experts at causing trouble. The effort is being led by Thomas Hiltachk, a lawyer who was one of the leaders of the successful effort to recall California Gov. Gray Davis in 2003. Politics is not just hardball to this crowd; it's almost literally a fight to the death.
 The proponents of the initiative understand completely that a constitutional crisis could damage the nation's democratic process and undermine the legitimacy of a presidential election. In their view that's preferable to a Republican defeat.
 California voters would be doing themselves and the nation a favor by soundly defeating this poisonous initiative if it makes it onto the ballot in June.

HEADLINE: The Battle Over Health Care

 BODY:
One of the enduring frustrations of presidential elections is that candidates and their parties sound like Tweedledum and Tweedledee on many issues. In 2008, when it comes to health care, which is emerging as a defining domestic issue, voters will find stark differences in philosophy and commitment between Democrats and Republicans. 
 The three leading Democratic candidates all want to achieve universal or near universal health insurance coverage. The four leading Republican candidates espouse no such goal and barely mention the uninsured. The Democrats are willing to put substantial federal money into health care reform. The Republicans are not. The Democrats would expand government health insurance programs and give the federal government a greater role in regulating the insurance industry. The Republicans generally want to shrink federal programs and free the insurance industry from what they consider regulatory shackles. 
 Compared with these sharp differences between the two parties, the distinctions between leading candidates within each party are small, mostly a matter of tactics to achieve comparable goals. We far prefer the Democrats' approach to health insurance, since at least they want to address an issue that must be resolved for reasons of economics, public health and fairness. Sadly, none of the leading candidates, in either party, has the vision or the political courage to propose radical solutions for the big underlying problem behind America's health care crisis: the inexorably rising costs. 
 The Republican Candidates
 Two Republican candidates have yet to grapple seriously with health care reform. John McCain, running largely on Iraq and national security, has not said anything substantial about health care, nor has he even included it among issues listed on his campaign Web site. Fred Thompson has only a brief paragraph on his Web site in which he opposes new mandates, higher taxes or a Washington-controlled program, and calls for free-market solutions. He has also called for reduced spending on entitlements and says he would have opposed the new Medicare prescription drug benefit.
 Rudolph Giuliani, who leads the Republican field in national polls, has only sketchy plans but has made it clear that he favors free-market approaches and is strongly opposed to what he mislabels as the Democrats' push for socialized medicine. Borrowing from President Bush, he proposes a tax deduction of up to $15,000 to help families buy private health insurance instead of getting it through their employers. He believes millions of people might choose that option, creating a market in which insurance companies would rush in with affordable policies to cover them, and the nation would begin to move away from the employer-based system that the Democrats are trying to bolster. For the poor, he envisions some combination of vouchers and tax refunds to help buy policies but has given no indication of how much that program would cost or how he would pay for it.
 His proposals are not likely to make much of a dent in the ranks of the uninsured. Tax deductions are of little use to low-income people who pay little or no income tax, and insurers are notorious for refusing individual policies to high-risk or chronically ill people. Given Mr. Giuliani's eagerness to ease regulation of insurance companies it is hard to see how he could make that market work better. 
 Mitt Romney has the most developed health plan among the Republicans, as one might expect given his prominent role in spurring health care reform in Massachusetts. As governor of that left-leaning state, he helped make Massachusetts a leader in providing universal coverage, mostly by mandating that everyone must buy health insurance or pay a financial penalty. But as a candidate in the Republican primaries he has changed course, disavowing any need for mandates and contending that what was right for Massachusetts would not be right for the country. 
 Instead of a national reform effort, he wants the 50 states to devise their own plans, but without much financial help from the federal government. He promises federal incentives to help states deregulate their health insurance markets to encourage cheaper policies. 
 His key proposal at the national level centers on tax deductions to help people pay for health care. He would allow individuals to deduct their out-of-pocket expenditures -- and any premiums paid for insurance policies they bought on their own rather than through their employer -- from their taxable income. For those who still cannot afford coverage, he would encourage states to redirect money now used for charity care to help low-income people buy private health insurance. There would be no new federal money for this purpose. His advisers estimate the proposals would cost a modest $10 billion a year in reduced revenues to the United States Treasury. 
 The problem of relying on tax deductions to increase insurance coverage is that they mostly favor the better off. The problem with relying on the states to enact the needed reforms is that the plight of the uninsured would be left to the whims of geography. Few states have the financial resources that allowed Massachusetts to move to universal coverage, and many states lack the expertise to mount a sophisticated program. 
 The Democratic Candidates
 Although Republicans routinely lambaste the Democrats for supporting socialized medicine or government programs in which bureaucrats would dictate your health coverage, the plans put forth by the three leading Democratic candidates -- Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards -- are all very careful to build on the existing system of employer-based coverage supplemented by government programs like Medicare, Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program.
 None of them is proposing a ''single payer'' system run by the government. And all bend over backward to reassure people that they can maintain their current coverage if they like it. Their political goal is to head off opposition from those who fear that their own coverage might suffer in the course of covering some 47 million uninsured people.
 The Democratic plans have far more similarities than differences. All three would move toward universal coverage and would rely heavily on mandates to do so. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards would require everyone to take out health insurance. That would bring young and healthy people into the system to help subsidize coverage for the more sickly, and would eliminate the problem of ''free riders,'' who show up uninsured at the emergency room and get very expensive care without paying. Mr. Obama would require parents to get insurance for their children but has no mandate for adults.
 All three would require big employers to provide health insurance or contribute to the cost of covering their employees outside the workplace. But they differ in the treatment of small businesses, whose opposition helped derail the last big reform effort in 1993. Mr. Edwards is the toughest. He would require small businesses to provide insurance coverage or help pay for coverage elsewhere. Mr. Obama would exempt them from any mandate. Mrs. Clinton, in what looks suspiciously like a bribe to buy small business support, promises them a tax credit for providing coverage.
 The Clinton plan would cost an estimated $110 billion a year, the Edwards plan $90 billion to $120 billion, the Obama plan $50 billion to $65 billion. All three would finance their programs partly by rolling back Bush-era tax cuts for those making more than $250,000 a year and partly with debatable savings they would get through cost-cutting.
 All three would require insurers to accept everyone without regard to pre-existing conditions, would provide tax subsidies to low-income people, and would establish purchasing pools to help individuals get low group rates.
 There would be a menu of options for people dissatisfied with their current policies because of high costs or limited benefits, including both private health plans and a public program that would compete alongside them. That would provide an interesting test of whether government or private plans are more effective and popular, a matchup that critics of ''government-run'' programs seem determined to avoid.
 The Clinton plan has an innovative proposal to limit the premiums that families have to pay to a certain percentage of their income, as yet undefined. That is a welcome protection for consumers but could cause problems if medical costs continue to rise far faster than wages.
 WHAT'S MISSING
 All of the plans, both Republican and Democratic, fail to provide a plausible solution to the problem that has driven health care reform to the fore as a political issue: the inexorably rising costs that drive up insurance rates and force employers to cut back on coverage or charge higher premiums. All of the plans acknowledge the need to restrain costs, but most of the remedies they offer are not likely to do much.
 Electronic medical records to eliminate errors and increase efficiency, more preventive care to head off serious diseases, and better coordination of patients suffering multiple, chronic illnesses are all worthy proposals, but there is scant evidence they will reduce costs. Proposals to import drugs from abroad, allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, restrain malpractice expenses, increase competition among health plans, and empower consumers to shop more wisely for medical care might help a bit. But many experts doubt that any of this will truly put the brakes on escalating health care costs. 
 No top candidate in either party has broached more drastic remedies, like limiting the use of expensive new technologies, cutting reimbursements to doctors and hospitals, or forcing people to use health maintenance organizations. And no one has suggested imposing higher taxes on everyone, not just the wealthy, to finance universal coverage. These solutions are not even discussed on the campaign trail lest they alienate voters and interest groups. 
 At this stage, the various plans should be considered as broad outlines of where the candidates want to go, with details to be worked out later. Voters who put a high priority on covering all or most of the uninsured will prefer the Democrats' approach, as we do. The chief danger is that the Democrats have a tendency to imply that everyone can be covered with good benefit packages without inconveniencing anyone but the wealthy. Their cost and savings assumptions will need thorough analysis when more detailed plans emerge. 
 Voters who put a higher priority on reshaping the health care system along free-market lines than on achieving universal coverage will prefer the Republican plans. Those plans' likely impact on costs will also need to be analyzed when more details emerge. The ''magic of the market'' may be less than magical. 
 Given the wide split between Republican and Democratic approaches, the polarized politics in Washington, and the overriding need to find a way out of the morass in Iraq, it will be an uphill battle to achieve consensus on health care any time soon. But at least voters will have a clear choice of which way the candidates are headed.

HEADLINE: After Rate Cut, Stocks Rise but Dollar Falls

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve finally cut its benchmark short-term interest rate, and the stock market celebrated, racking up big weekly gains, but in the currency markets, the dollar declined sharply. 
 The Fed cut the fed funds rate, its main short-term rate, by half a percentage point, to 4.75 percent, on Tuesday, and stocks rocketed upward in the United States and most markets overseas. The Dow Jones industrial average had its best daily performance in five years, and stocks rallied for much of the week. But the dollar weakened against other currencies. The euro was worth more than $1.40 for the first time and the Canadian dollar reached parity with the dollar for the first time since 1976. The prices of gold and oil also rose.
 For the week, the Dow gained 377.67 points, or 2.8 percent, to close at 13,820.19. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 41.5 points, or 2.8 percent, to close at 1,525.75. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 69.04 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 2,671.22.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.62 percent from 4.46 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: The Duchamp of the Muscle Car

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
RENSSELAERVILLE, N.Y.
 ONE of the first things you see when you drive onto Richard Prince's property in this small upstate town is a car that doesn't belong in a small town: a low-slung 2005 Ford GT that tops out at over 200 m.p.h. and looks like something built for the Bonneville Salt Flats.
 But on a recent overcast afternoon this is not the car that Mr. Prince wants to show a visitor. It is another one, inside a cavernous concrete-floored warehouse that he recently built near his house, an odd combination of auto-body shop and art gallery. The other car is also a GT, but of a make designed to go nowhere. It is composed, in fact, of earth-brown modeling clay shaped into classic American muscle: grille, cowl, scoops, bad-boy ducktail spoiler. 
 While this life-size model has much in common with the car-centric sculptures Mr. Prince has been making for the last 15 years, it is not his piece. It's an unadulterated piece of Detroit. Ford's design division gave it to Mr. Prince more than a year ago, agreeing to let him do whatever he wanted with it, perhaps even alter it to make something not exactly theirs, not exactly art. ''They just said they didn't want to be embarrassed,'' he said.
 Mr. Prince's dark, funny, enigmatic work will be the subject of a 30-year retrospective opening on Friday at the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan. And though he did not make the clay car, he seriously considered putting it front and center in the show. In the end his reasons for changing his mind had more to do with humility than originality: he thought the car was too powerful a work of art in its own right.
 ''It's almost as if I need to catch up to this,'' he explained, gazing admiringly on the model's grooved contours. ''I think I still need about a year.''
 The conundrum is a good introduction to the slippery career of Mr. Prince, whose influential work, now highly sought by collectors, has long played cat and mouse with distinctions between life and art, reality and fantasy, truth and fiction. It operates somewhere in the territory of Duchamp and Warhol, but often with quite different intentions and a fascination with a very specific down-and-dirty vision of American popular culture that will now climb the Guggenheim spiral: biker girls, naughty nurses, hippies, pulp fiction, cartoons, borscht-belt humor, Marlboro men and muscle cars. Lately, though -- as evidenced by the completion in January of the building he calls the Body Shop, a well-appointed 15,000-square-foot warehouse so large that his son and daughter derisively call it ''the Home Depot'' -- the muscle-car chapter of Mr. Prince's obsessions has begun to take up much more of his time and energy.
 From the mail-order car hoods that he first started painting and hanging in the late 1980s to evoke Ad Reinhardt or Mark Rothko (''They were really minimal, and I don't think anybody got them,'' he said), Mr. Prince progressed to appropriating heftier chunks of automotive anatomy, making sarcophaguslike sculptures crowned with air scoops, usually left with the appearance of being only partly primed and spackled with body-shop Bondo compound.
 As he explained in the Body Shop, walking around a few examples on display in the building's elegantly lighted gallery section: ''They're in that state before you're actually finished, just before you paint it, and I've always loved that look on teenagers' cars: nine coats of perfect paint on the hood but then the doors are left bare metal because they never got around to it.''
 At first he borrowed from the up-on-blocks world simply because he was obsessed with the look and wanted to recreate it for himself, he said, an aesthetic he thought of as ''maybe a combination of Big Daddy Roth and Donald Judd.''
 ''If it ends up looking like art,'' he said he recalled thinking of his sculpture, ''that's great. But if it doesn't, then that's completely O.K. with me.'' 
 In the sly deadpan that accompanies many of his statements, Mr. Prince added, ''With these I consider myself pretty lucky that they did come out looking like art.''
 But all this conceptual car fetishizing seems to have been just a warm-up for Mr. Prince's newest project, which he began only a few months ago, and which pushes the art-or-not-art question up to its breaking point: a real car, a tricked-out modern re-creation of one of his favorites, a 1970 Dodge Challenger, that can be either driven at dangerous speeds or parked in a gallery, where it can be admired as sculpture. Or maybe both.
 Mr. Prince said he was still not quite sure what to consider the car, although he does plan an edition of three, and he thinks of the first one, recently completed for him by XV Motorsports in Irvington, N.Y., a high-end builder of modernized muscle cars, as an artist's proof. (Its first appearance will be at the Frieze Art Fair next month in London, where the car was recently shipped.)
 Aside from minor customizing Mr. Prince asked for, the car is identical to an earlier Challenger XV made using vintage shells but filling them with new high-performance engines, suspension and steering. (The company's prices start at $140,000.) 
 ''I kind of agreed with the look of the car they had put out,'' Mr. Prince said, adding that he also liked the custom color XV had already mixed for the car, a yellowish orange he calls ''Vitamin C.''
 On later versions, he said, he might customize the gas cap, headrests, upholstery and other parts of the car with his artwork. But for now a mean ride is being declared a kind of street-legal ready-made basically because Mr. Prince is in love with the way it looks -- and the way, as with many of the appropriations in his art, it reflects American desires and dreams, particularly those of his youth in the tumultuous 1960s and '70s. (Asked what he thought of Mr. Prince's calling one of his company's cars a Richard Prince, John Buscema, XV's founder, said, ''From my perspective if someone of Richard's caliber is looking at our cars that way, it's great.'') 
 Nancy Spector, the Guggenheim's chief curator and the organizer of the retrospective, ''Richard Prince: Spiritual America,'' said in an interview that she was still trying to figure out exactly what to think about the XV car.
 ''I don't know if the critical function has quite caught up to this yet,'' she said, smiling, and adding that she wondered what a Prince collector would do with one of the cars after he was handed the keys. ''I guess you'd probably want to insure it as a car, not as a Richard Prince, right?'' she said. 
 While his car-based work began only in the late 1980s, the catalog for the Guggenheim show, which includes some of Mr. Prince's writings, shows that cars have been loomed large in his thinking for a long time. 
 In a written dialogue between Mr. Prince and a kind of alter ego of his, an artist named John Dogg, Mr. Prince describes how Mr. Dogg -- who comes off as a minimalist Neal Cassady -- was once employed to deliver special cars to buyers by driving them across the country.
 One of his ''drive-aways,'' from Denver to Los Angeles, was a 1970 Dodge Challenger. ''He did it in 16 hours,'' Mr. Prince wrote. ''The owner wasn't expecting the car for three weeks.'' (For those keeping close score, Ms. Spector's catalog, with Mr. Prince's permission, acknowledges publicly for the first time that John Dogg, whose work was exhibited intermittently in the late 1980s, was indeed the creation of Mr. Prince and the New York art dealer Colin de Land, who died in 2003.)
 In some ways the car can be seen simply as an extension of Mr. Prince's obsessions as a prodigious collector of Americana, from first editions of Kerouac, Mario Puzo and many others to manuscripts, photos, pulp fiction, comics and magazines. It might also be viewed as an extension of the practice that first brought Mr. Prince to prominence in the art world: his photographs of existing photographs, most of them taken from ads for luxury goods and from the epic, cowboy scenes in Marlboro ads. The pictures emerged at a time when artists like Mr. Prince, Sherrie Levine, Jack Goldstein and Cindy Sherman were first starting to use the camera to dig deep into the late 20th century's collective image bank, questioning what they found there and asking what it meant about how we saw ourselves.
 Ms. Spector said the cars could be thought of as yet another self-reflecting image. But in much of Mr. Prince's car work, as with his paintings of the texts of corny, often cruel jokes, she sees other intentions at work.
 ''I don't know exactly how to describe it, but I would say there's an aspect of tragedy in there, of melancholy,'' she said. She suggested that the economically depressed part of upstate New York where Mr. Prince has lived and worked for more than a decade had also had an effect on him, increasing the ''real identification with the downtrodden'' that she has long seen in his art.
 ''I don't see irony in Richard's work in the end; there's a real pathos there,'' she said, differentiating him from Warhol and trying to soften the prevailing image of him as one of the darkest excavators of the American soul.
 In person, Mr. Prince, 58, does not seem particularly dark. He manages to be affable and also a bit evasive, but in a way that makes you think he is just trying to keep things interesting. In interviews and writings he has said some things that have turned out to be untrue: that he destroyed all his early work, for example, work that has turned up in collections and in a recent exhibition. And there are other things that people have reason to think may be fictionalized, even where he says he was born, the Panama Canal Zone. 
 ''No one really knows Richard's biography,'' said Ms. Spector, who spent a lot of time with him over the last year preparing the show and professes to be unsure of many basic facts even now.
 ''There are all these stock lines and lies; they've been there since the beginning,'' she said, adding only half-jokingly: ''His real name might not be Richard Prince. It's entirely possible.''
 On a recent visit, Mr. Prince -- or at least the artist known as Mr. Prince -- was playing host to a local man in a van who had come to install lightning rods on his growing collection of buildings, including the Body Shop, his studio, another gallery space, a library for his huge vintage-book collection and the modest clapboard house where he lives with his family.
 In June lightning struck another of his buildings on a separate piece of land, one he called Second House, a run-down ranch-style home that he bought, tweaked only a little and filled with some of his works. The house, which was bought by the Guggenheim two years ago, was covered only in silver insulation and was accompanied by an all-black 1973 Plymouth Barracuda sitting in the weeds nearby, giving it the vague look of a place where something illegal was probably under way. Fire caused by the lightning gutted the house and destroyed one of Mr. Prince's paintings.
 The house's ethos, however, could be felt throughout the Body Shop, where several larger, spectral car-based sculptures were taking shape. Mr. Prince talked excitedly about how a California company called Dynacorn is now feeding a new trend in which ''vintage'' cars are being made completely from new, recreated parts: -- an idea that sounds almost like one Mr. Prince could have hatched himself.
 He said his own car ideas had become so numerous that he now employs two local men just to help him with auto-body work. He also said word of his enthusiasms had spread quickly around the area.
 ''People just come and drop off parts in the yard,'' he said appreciatively.
 Before he called it a day, Mr. Prince took a reporter to the charred ruins of Second House, which sits alone outside town off a narrow road. The flat-black Barracuda is still parked behind it, undamaged and appearing more menacing now that the house is windowless and scarred with soot. Mr. Prince said he still had not decided whether he wanted to rebuild the house, replace it or simply encase it somehow and leave it a ruin.
 ''It looks kind of nice like this,'' he said. But he added, turning uncharacteristically metaphysical: ''When I first heard about the lightning hitting it, I got kind of worried. I thought: 'Oh God, maybe it has something to do with the Guggenheim show. Maybe it's the first review.' ''

HEADLINE: How Do You Say 'Got Milk' En Espanol?

BYLINE: By CYNTHIA GORNEY. 
Cynthia Gorney teaches at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. Her last article for the magazine was about the mothers of sons serving in Iraq.

 BODY:
''That boy over there?'' John Gallegos said. ''Straddler. His mother is a Learner. She's going to be talking to him in Spanish. Watch.'' 
 Gallegos stood quietly, in the wide central part of a mall, pretending to look at nothing. The mother and son passed close by. She had dark red hair and was leaning on the boy's arm; he was 14 or so, and in blue jeans. Gallegos was right. The mother was chatting amiably in Spanish. Gallegos tilted his head toward four teenagers shambling along. ''Those kids? All Straddlers,'' he said. ''Well, the guy with his cap backwards -- he might be a Navigator. He's probably more English-media-consuming.'' 
 The mall was in the city of Downey, which is part of Los Angeles. It was an ordinary California midrange shopping center: clean floors, Starbucks, hip apparel chains. Gallegos had come in to examine a clothing store he thought might become a new client. He's a publicista an adman. He runs a 60-person agency called Grupo Gallegos in Long Beach. His agency wins awards for its commercials, which are funny, edgy and require translating into English when international judging committees study them. This particular week, in the middle of summer, Grupo Gallegos work was advertising leche, transporte de autobuses, pollo, ropa interior, servicio de Internet de alta velocidad, consultorios medicos, gimnasios and pilas that would be California Milk Processor Board milk, Crucero bus lines, Foster Farms chicken, Fruit of the Loom underwear, Comcast high-speed Internet service, Quick Health medical clinics, Bally fitness clubs and Energizer batteries, which the Gallegos people had decided to promote via a long-faced Mexican man who walks down the street explaining that as he has figured out that he's immortal (scenes of him being mashed by a plummeting second-story sign, impaled on a spear in a museum, etc.), he requires an especially durable battery for his camera. 
 Grupo Gallegos advertising runs on Spanish-language television, Spanish radio, in Spanish magazine pages and on Spanish or bilingual Web sites. Some of these enterprises are housed in places you might expect them to be: New York, Miami, Los Angeles, Houston. Many are not. There's full-time Spanish television broadcasting now in Anchorage; Salt Lake City; Little Rock, Ark.; Wichita Falls, Tex.; Indianapolis; Savannah, Ga.; Boston; Oklahoma City; Syracuse, N.Y.; and Minneapolis. The area encompassing Portland, Ore., now has 10 Spanish radio stations, while four years ago it had only 3. The July issue of ESPN Deportes, with Hugo SAnchez on the cover, had a Gallegos underwear ad inside; so did the gossip magazine Mira!, with Angelica Rivera on the cover; and a People en Espanol with RBD on the cover; and a Men's Health en Espanol, whose cover article promised that James Bond would show readers how to be an hombre de accion.
 If the only name on that list that sounds familiar is Bond's the others are, respectively, the Mexican national soccer team coach, a telenovela star and a wildly popular pop-music group then Gallegos is interested less in selling you products, since you are likely not Hispanic, than in pointing out the exploding spending power of the demographic that is. The estimate worked up by the Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies for 2007 is $928 billion. Those are dollars spent inside this country by Hispanic consumers, American-born citizens as well as green-card residents and the undocumented, on things they want or need: batteries, iPods, laundry soap, lawn chairs, motor oil, Bulova watches, new-home loans, Volvos, takeout pizza, cellphones, power saws, swimming pools, deodorant, airline tickets and plasma TV's. It's $200 billion more than was spent two years ago. Propelled by continuous immigration and larger family size, the dual factors that are making the Hispanic population multiply faster than any other in the United States, the spending figure is expected to top a trillion dollars within the next three years. 
 In comparison with some of his colleagues in Hispanic advertising, in fact, John Gallegos runs a moderate-size shop. There are more than a hundred United States ad agencies, not including the publicistas in Puerto Rico, that now work almost exclusively in Spanish. The bigger Hispanic agencies have accounts like McDonald's (Me encanta, which roughly translates to ''I'm lovin' it''), and Chevrolet (Subete, ''Get in''). Bounty's slogan in English, ''The quicker picker-upper,'' appears in Spanish as Con Bounty si puedes -- ''With Bounty, yes you can.'' T-Mobile does Estamos juntos, ''We're all together.'' Toyota does Avanza confiado, ''Advance confidently.'' Wal-Mart reportedly spends more than $60 million a year on reaching Hispanics, and for some years the Wal-Mart Spanish tag line, composed by a Houston agency called Lopez Negrete Communications, was Para su familia, de todo corazon. Siempre. Which lofted the blunt English ''Low prices, always,'' into a line enduring enough for a tombstone: ''For your family, from the heart. Always.'' 
 From this vantage, the grim admonitions of anti-immigration groups are hard to hear distinctly; they're drowned out by the sound of cash registers. At the Grupo Gallegos office there's a closet full of display cards on which fragments of information have been written out in black ink. The cards are frequently rifled through and arranged onto giant poster boards, and the first time I visited the Gallegos offices this summer, the boards from the most recent presentation were still leaning against a wall; the prospective client was a food company. The boards said things like:
 LEARNERS: foreign born, Spanish dominant, 3 av kids, 65% rent
 STRADDLERS: immigrated young, 4 av HH size, blue collar/semi prof, bilingual/mostly Spanish
 NAVIGATORS: English dominant, some Spanish, 78% at least some college, semi prof/prof, 60% own home, HH inc $76K
 The towers of information, with arrows here and there for emphasis, were taller than I am. They included Learner/Straddler/Navigator particulars on sour-cream usage (Navigators buy the most). The Senate immigration bill was collapsing during the weeks I spent watching Grupo Gallegos at work, and the Gallegos office sometimes felt like a prism in which the information generating so much political argument was continuously being refracted and reassembled into something vigorous and celebratory. ''You ask: the guy who just came across the border with a coyote, do I want to go after him, too?'' Gallegos once said to me. ''Well, he's going to get a job. He's going to work. He's going to start buying products and contributing to the economy. So while he might not be viable for a Mercedes today, I can introduce you to people who came here illegally or legally, with nothing, and are now driving a Mercedes. Advertising is aspirational. I want to aim ahead of where my audience is. Unless it's the equivalent of beef to Hindus, I always say, any product and any service should be sold to Latinos in this country.''
 Gallegos happened to be sitting in an office conference room at that moment with two account executives, an immigrant from Argentina named Maria Maldini and an immigrant from Mexico named Ken Muench, and they both considered this.
 ''Is there a beef-to-Hindus equivalent?'' Maldini asked. 
 ''Not that I've been able to find,'' Gallegos said.
 ''Sleepovers,'' Muench said, and smiled. 
 ''True,'' Gallegos said. ''My parents wouldn't let me sleep over at friends' houses. I still won't let my 8-year-old. You have to be very high on the acculturation curve to do sleepovers.''
 he Grupo Gallegos office stretches across the sixth floor of a building one block off the beach. It has conference rooms and odd corner spaces that are enclosed by red curtains, like indoor Bedouin tents, so the creative guys on deadline can go slouch inside on stuffed chairs and pull the curtains around them and stare at their open laptops, looking desperate. The preferred Gallegos term for this state is en el fondo del mar, at the deepest depths of the sea. The creative guys wear blue jeans and T-shirts and tend to be unshaven. The office chatter eddies around the Gallegos workspace in Mexican Spanish, Argentine Spanish, Colombian Spanish, Puerto Rican Spanish, Cuban Spanish and the lispy Castillian Spanish of Spain, which is spoken fluently by, among others, a woman of Korean ancestry who grew up near Barcelona. It's all extremely modern and confusing. John Gallegos, who is 40, was born in Los Angeles to a family from the Mexican state of Zacatecas; he and the other United States-born Hispanics at the agency slide back and forth between languages, frequently midsentence. ''O.K., aqui esta el problema que tenemos when we really start looking at the brand.''
 One morning I walked into a red-curtained corner as Curro Chozas, one of the art directors, was saying in Spanish: ''Tutankhamen, Charlie Chaplin, Mozart, George Washington -- whatever. Anyway, whoever he is, he rips open his shirt. VRROOOM! It's a bird! It's a plane! No! It's George Washington!''
 Chozas is from Madrid. He talks very fast and is good at sound effects, so the vrrooom made everybody jump. On the stuffed chairs were a copywriter named Saul Escobar, who's from Mexico, and one of the creative directors, Juan Pablo Oubina, who's from Buenos Aires and was listening to Chozas while staring at his own feet. Oubina has a shaggy dark hair and a melancholy countenance, even when he's greatly amused. Escobar and Chozas spent the previous days imagining a set of Dadaist spots placing famous characters from history in interesting situations with speedy things, strapped-on rockets and race cars and so on; this was promoting high-speed Internet service from Comcast, for which a previous campaign had featured wallets so grateful for Comcast's low prices that they leapt from their owners' possession and flew through the air in order to protect them from mishaps like spilled ketchup or reaching pickpockets. 
 Escobar and Chozas were tag-teaming now, waiting for a reaction. 
 ''Napoleon Bonaparte, for example,'' Chozas said. ''Lassie. Mahatma Gandhi.''
 ''That would get my attention, Gandhi with the race car,'' Escobar said.
 ''Napoleon's too hard,'' Oubina said. 
 ''You think more people will recognize Gandhi than Napoleon?'' Chozas said.
 ''Pancho Villa,'' Escobar said. 
 ''There must be 200 ads with George Washington in them,'' Oubina said. He stretched and scrunched his hair. ''Cleopatra would be better known than Napoleon.'' 
 ''Let's go ask somebody,'' Chozas said.
 They trooped out. Oubina has a college degree, owns his home, has a wife-one-child HH size, is more comfortable speaking Spanish than English, would be white-collar if he actually wore collars and at 38 has lived in this country for less than a third of his life; for these and other reasons, he is a Straddler, he told me, with certain Learner/Navigator undercurrents. At Grupo Gallegos, they all think this way. (''Navigator, with Learner mother and Straddler father,'' one account director said crisply, when I asked her to label herself: she's a 34-year-old professional; they came from Mexico when she was 6; her father manages well now in English; her mother doesn't.) It was Oubina who led the preparation for the first Grupo Gallegos ad I ever saw, last spring, during one of my periodic telenovela binges. The tagline was Toma leche, ''Have some milk.'' The ad was vastly more entertaining than my novela, and I thought I appreciated what the challenge had been; the counterpart English campaign was ''Got Milk?'' and I was pretty sure that asking people in Spanish whether they have milk is a bad idea, since I had once learned the regrettable way that if you use Spanish to ask a male Mexican grocer, ''Do you have eggs?'' you are inquiring as to his testicles. 
 In this instance, as it turns out, Tiene leche? may or may not be a vulgarity about breast milk, depending on situational context, but that wasn't the real challenge at all. Translation alone rarely is. (The famous Chevy Nova story, about how General Motors bungled its 1960s Latin American car marketing because nobody figured out in time that no va means ''doesn't go,'' has been reclassified as urban legend; there was a Mexican gasoline called Nova, debunkers point out, and besides, no va is not the way a Spanish speaker would typically say a car doesn't work.) The real challenge, for Grupo Gallegos, was how to sell more milk to as many kinds of Hispanics as possible without alienating any of them or boring all of them. Also, as a point of creative honor, the Gallegos people didn't want to look lame alongside the English ''Got Milk?'' campaign, which is internationally regarded as one of the brilliant ad runs of the last 20 years. That campaign's big idea, to use adspeak, was deprivation; the San Francisco agency Goodby, Silverstein, stumped about how to draw attention to a product as familiar and soporific as milk, had decided to play with the comic horrors inherent in discovering the milk carton was empty. In one of the most celebrated of the ''Got Milk?'' ads, a history buff who knows the name of Alexander Hamilton's killer grabs the phone to answer a radio quiz question and win a load of money, but he can't make himself understood because his mouth is jammed up with peanut-butter sandwich and he's completely out of milk.
 But this would have been a gross misfire in Spanish -- and not simply because an El Salvadorean immigrant, for example, is probably unfamiliar with both Aaron Burr and peanut-butter sandwiches. The whole theme was wrong, especially for people who have abandoned their home countries to migrate hundreds of miles north for work. ''There's already enough deprivation,'' Oubina told me. ''It wasn't funny.'' 
 Everybody at the agency wanted to be memorable and sharp, though; they were not going to stick Mama in her kitchen lovingly pouring milk for the children while exchanging smiles with Abuelita, as grandmas are called in Spanish. For some years now, that has been the standard these-are-Latinos cue when Hispanic agencies are doing the work. You don't see dumb Anglo-generated cliches in these ads, like strategically placed tortillas or businessmen wearing sombreros. In Hispanic-made commercials the cliches are homegrown; the United States in general appears as a splendidly cheerful, up-by-the-bootstraps sort of place, full of suburban homeowners and hardworking men with pickup trucks, and an impressive amount of the time somebody has also figured out how to stage all this amid a warm multigenerational family, with Abuelita helping demonstrate the merits of the product. It's referred to in some agencies as ''Abuelita advertising.'' It makes Oubina a little crazy. ''Look how she's dressed,'' he said in exasperation, replaying on his computer an Abuelita ad for cooking oil. Technically there was no abuelita in this one, just a beautifully-outfitted mama in a spotless kitchen, experiencing overwhelming joy because of the health benefits the oil was bringing her family. ''I would never make this ad,'' Oubina said. ''It looks like 750,000 other brands. On any team I lead, there is never going to be a kitchen with somebody exclaiming, 'Mmmm, how delicious!' ''
 The milk problem sent Oubina and Escobar and Chozas into the deepest depths of the sea for a while, until it occurred to them to improvise with the opposite of deprivation: maniacal consumption, with the ensuing calcium-and-vitamins overload. They thought up a town where gravity is unreliable, causing the locals to float matter-of-factly along 30 feet in the air until they suddenly crash to the ground; their bones are exceptionally strong, though, because they drink so much milk, so they get right up and stroll away. Same thing with powerful teeth (a town where bus riders bite the straps hanging overhead) and hair with the strength of steel. Big success: satisfied client, international award for the gravity spot. ''I just don't want to do old-school Hispanic advertising,'' Oubina said. ''I'm not trying to sound like an artist here. If I thought that, I'd be out of work by the end of the year. I'm just talking from a strategic point of view. You have to put something out there that hasn't been seen before.'' 
 On his desk Oubina had a plastic Energizer bunny, which fell over after he wound it up and was now on its back, drumming and flailing. The agency had won awards for its Energizer ads too, but now they had a new campaign to develop, and Oubina was grappling; he had to write a 15-second television spot that was eye-catching, praised the battery, contained a comic punch line that would make perfect sense to Hispanics and allowed el conejito -- the little rabbit -- to do its marching act across the screen. He was also supposed to try to help make the brand iconic for Spanish speakers. That was the word they were using at the agency; they had discerned that in English, people will use ''going and going, like the Energizer bunny,'' but that nobody makes como el conejo Energizer references of a similar nature, which means that in Spanish the battery is still a battery, not an icon or a simile or a feeling about life. This was perhaps a situation they could rectify. ''In advertising it's not easy to be different,'' Oubina said, and sighed. ''It takes 10 times as much work.''
 You can track part of the modern history of United States Hispanics, in a way, through the proliferation and escalating ambition of this country's publicistas. Forty years ago, they were mostly a small group of Cuban-exile ad executives in New York and Miami, talking American agencies into letting them translate ad copy into Spanish. Then all-Hispanic agencies started opening up here, trying -- often to no avail -- to persuade clients that there were enough Spanish speakers in this country, with enough disposable income, to merit whole campaigns aimed directly at them. ''I used to have clients who said, 'I don't want those people in my store,' '' the Gallegos media director, Ken Deutsch, who is one of the agency's only non-Hispanics, told me. ''It was all: 'Gardener.' 'Criminal.' Or just: 'They don't have money.' '' 
 Then the 2000 United States Census data began going public, and in its wake came the rattling headlines: at 15 percent of the present United States population, or 44 million people (factor in an estimated 9 million Latin American illegal immigrants), Hispanics now outnumber African-Americans. Their populations are multiplying so fast in certain parts of the country -- nearly a 1,000 percent increase in Atlanta, for example, between 1980 and 2000 -- that one recent report used the term ''hypergrowth.'' More than half come from or have origins in Mexico, but the array of homelands is extensive; when Grupo Gallegos got the Fruit of the Loom account a few years ago, Favio Ucedo, the Argentine chief creative director, decided to Hispanicize the four fruit guys, all of whom hover around in the ads offering underwear advice, via some mother-country humor that in Spanish constituted a collective private joke. He made Apple Guy and Leaf Guy Mexicans, hiring Mexican actors and giving them script lines that indicated they were the group leaders. Red Grape Guy became a Caribbean, dark-skinned and the best dancer, with the lilting half-swallowed Spanish of Puerto Rico or the Dominican Republic. There had to be a South American, Ucedo decided, so he tipped his hat to his countrymen's unfortunate reputation elsewhere in Latin America and made Green Grape Guy an ego-inflated, overbearing Argentine, a caricature Ucedo knew Mexicans especially would relish. 
 Gallegos brought Ucedo with him seven years ago when he left the Hispanic agency where he worked before deciding to start his own shop; and one day when we went driving around Los Angeles Gallegos talked with some agitation about Abuelita advertising -- not that he's unilaterally opposed to it, he said, or feels anything but the greatest affection for his own abuelita, who as it happens now lives with his parents. ''Latinos are more family-centered than the population in general,'' he said. ''But is that the beginning and end of us? No. And if that's the only thing you put into a commercial to make it Latino, the commercial is boring.''
 We were crossing the flat southeastern swath of the city where Gallegos lived as a child until his parents moved the family to a more middle-class and also less Hispanic area in neighboring Orange County. Gallegos narrated as he drove. ''Here's the church where my mom and dad got married. . . . Here's Nix Check Cashing, where I used to bring my grandfather. . . . Look at that store with the wheel rims. That's a big thing with Latinos. The cars have rims.'' He chuckled. He was in his own car, a silver Lexus with entirely ordinary rims. He was wearing khaki pants, brown leather shoes, and a blue button-down shirt hanging loose. He's a registered Republican, though he says he now leans Independent. He majored in business at the University of Southern California, where he was a catcher on the baseball team. His wife, Palma, is half second-generation Italian, half came-over-on-the-Mayflower descendant; Gallegos is still such a devoted U.S.C. football fan that when they were engaged, he advised her to time their wedding date outside the football season or he would never be able to go away with her for their anniversary.
 ''Here's the grammar school where my aunt went,'' Gallegos said. He uses English automatically, unless he's around people who prefer Spanish, and as I looked at him in profile I contemplated the crash course in advertising that I was receiving at his agency. One of the first tasks the Gallegos researchers undertake when the agency begins a campaign is clarifying who the ''bull's-eye target'' is -- whether the ads should be aimed most directly at Learners, say, for whom some clever reference to their newness in the United States might help. (They did a Tecate beer ad recently in which a young working man named Basilio puts up politely all day with mangled English versions of his name -- ''Hey, Basedo!'' ''Hi, Basyloh!'' -- and finally walks into a bar full of Latinos, where everybody, hoisting Tecates, gets it right.) Bull's-eyeing a Straddler in Spanish made intuitive sense, too: you're here, you're acquiring and nos entendemos, we understand each other.
 But Spanish advertising aimed at a person like Gallegos, who lives fully and prosperously in the English-speaking United States -- why make the effort? Why wouldn't a company regard him as a frequent-flying, golf-playing, John Grisham-reading Lexus driver and assume they've got his attention every time he picks up an airline magazine or watches college football on English-language TV? Whenever Gallegos and I talked about this, he'd ask why anybody should bother targeting ad campaigns specifically at women. ''You can see the same ads the men see,'' he would say. 
 During his ''Galaygos'' period, the years in elementary and middle school when teachers regularly mispronounced his surname and he gave up trying to correct them, Gallegos -- it's supposed to sound like gah-YEH-gos -- stopped speaking Spanish to anyone outside his family, desperate to blend in. It was in his parochial high school that he began to ''reacculturate,'' as the marketing terminology puts it; there, in the early 1980s, ethnic-identity badges had become chic, and the Anglo kids got his name right. ''Then I became John Gallegos again,'' he said. There are certainly Hispanics in this country who know no Spanish -- born-heres who were never chewed out by their elders in Spanish; never curled up on a couch with a favorite aunt to make fun of the scheming women on the telenovelas; have zero consciousness of Sabado Gigante, the beloved cornball variety show, which broadcasts live from Miami and is the longest-running weekly entertainment program on TV, in English or Spanish. But the percentage who have had the language assimilated out of them completely is strikingly small -- a national survey last year found that fewer than 5 percent of United States Latinos say they can neither read nor converse even a little in Spanish. Gallegos regards this degree of monolingualism, to be blunt about it, as their loss. 
 ''Here's my neighborhood,'' he said suddenly. The streets were curving now, with broad-leafed trees and wide, well-tended lawns -- $850,000 around here for a teardown, Gallegos observed. He was quiet for a minute. His agency has done advertising aimed at Hispanics who live in communities like his own; on occasion, when they think it's appropriate, they'll do the work in English as well as Spanish. But if there's any single net that can be draped across the length and breadth of American Hispanics, it's the Spanish language itself, and like his publicista colleagues, Gallegos is perplexed at American truculence about assuming that full integration into this country requires leaving the native language behind -- that bilingualism in the United States is something to be overcome on the path to success, rather than cultivated and celebrated as a success unto itself. The most famous immigrant in California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, had just a few weeks earlier set off a small uproar at a National Association of Hispanic Journalists convention by declaring that he knew the best way for Hispanic immigrants to learn English well enough for life in the United States: ''Turn off the Spanish television,'' the governor said.
 We sat in front of Gallegos's house, which is white, spacious, Cape Codish. There's a swimming pool in the back. The children were away taking martial-arts classes or learning classical piano. The whole tableau looked like a public service announcement for American upward mobility, and Gallegos knew it. ''I'm the poster boy for what they think it should be like, right?'' he said. ''I guarantee you Arnold wouldn't have a problem with me. Registered Republican. Thriving young businessperson. Big donor to my university. But they don't know that I grew up in the environment they don't want to have -- watching Spanish television. We speak Spanish to this day. We speak Spanish in the house.''
 He started the car. ''If you really like me, what you're going to get is me promoting what I grew up with, which is more diversity,'' he said. ''Careful what you wish for.''
 Gallegos invited me to a family dinner at his parents' house the night before I left Long Beach. His mother, Maria Elena, had made coctel de camarones, shrimp cocktail flavored up with chopped avocados and tomatoes; and carnitas, shreds of fragrant pork spooned with fresh salsa into tortillas. She swore this was nothing special. Gallegos's father, who is also named John and worked his way up through various businesses while Gallegos and his sister were children, owns a company that makes light fixtures. His mother works at a public elementary school, as a bilingual liaison for parents who aren't comfortable in English. ''She's a great bridge,'' Gallegos said, as his mother handed him a plate of food in the kitchen. ''That's all I do, too. We're a bridge for the consumer.''
 When Gallegos's grandmother came in he kissed her on the cheek, addressing her with the respectful usted instead of tu, and everybody sat. The conversation ricocheted between Palma, who doesn't really speak Spanish; Gallegos's grandmother, who doesn't really speak English; his children, who understand Spanish but respond in English; his mother, who speaks both languages but prefers Spanish; and his father, who speaks both languages but prefers English. Nobody found this disorienting, including me; my father is from Mexico, the son of Warsaw Jews who fled in the 1920s to Mexico City, and our extended family gatherings used to sound like the Gallegoses', except with Polish thrown in when my grandparents wanted to mutter to each other in private. Like many immigrants' children, I tend toward complicated feelings about language, heritage and the wages of fitting in, and I had come across something I was interested in showing Gallegos: copies of two United States newspaper advertisements, circa 1910 -- one for Woodbury's Hair Tonic and the other for the Equitable Phonograph Company. Both, except for a few truncated phrases (''Greasy dandruff? Hair coming out?''), were entirely in Yiddish. 
 Gallegos's parents studied the ads, examining the lettering closely -- Yiddish is written in Hebrew characters -- and Gallegos looked over their shoulders. A century ago, like Italian and German and Chinese, Yiddish was a vibrant language of daily life and commerce in the United States, read all over the Eastern states in the pages of the Jewish Daily Forward. When Gallegos's grandchildren replay his agency's gravity ad, I wondered, will it look to them like these? Will Spanish in the United States have been recast by then as the language of the aged abuelitos, saluted in selective identity-establishing vocabulary words and the names of foods and holidays? What will his sons and daughter be speaking at their own family dinner tables?
 ''Anything's possible,'' Gallegos said. He traced one finger down the outline of the Woodbury's bottle. ''But I think there's a difference. There was a massive ocean between those people and their home countries. And technology prevented people from staying in touch.'' No immigrant group in United States history has ever had what this era's Spanish speakers have, in fact: an international border that can be crossed on foot; constant back-and-forth traffic and inexpensive phone communication to the countries of origin; the Internet, on which the Mexican daily Excelsior can materialize onscreen every morning and two clicks turns the entire Google landscape to Spanish; multiple networks of non-English broadcast programming with enormous audiences; and a long lineup of corporations eager to court these people's spending money in any manner that works. 
 It was dark by now, and Maria Elena Gallegos rose to bring dessert: a plate of sweet rolls, pan dulce, made by a Mexican bakery nearby. ''Both,'' Gallegos finally said. The languages his children will speak, he meant -- what they'll work in, what they'll dream in at night, how they'll live. ''Everybody will speak English,'' he said.''I think it's not going to be either-or. I think we might become a bilingual nation. And I don't think that's a bad thing.''

HEADLINE: Next to Downsize On Wall Street? The Exchange Floor

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Behind the marble facade of its neoclassical fortress on Wall Street, the New York Stock Exchange has been the hub of financial activity in Lower Manhattan for more than a century.
 But the buzz emanating from its famous trading floor is dying down as computerized trading has rapidly reduced the need for face-to-face transactions. In the next several weeks, the exchange plans to shut two trading rooms that were added decades ago, when its status as the place to buy and sell stocks was unchallenged.
 When the latest retreat is complete, the exchange floor will be half the size it was at its peak. The ''crowd'' -- the brokers and clerks on the floor -- has dwindled to about 1,700 from a high of more than 3,000. Before the exchange became a public company in 2005, its members controlled 1,366 seats, or licenses to trade. Now, about 800 brokers pay the annual $50,000 fee for a license.
 ''It is certainly not as crowded as it used to be,'' said Doreen Mogavero, 52, a veteran floor broker, who professed faith in the staying power of the downsized trading floor but admitted that she missed the tingle it used to generate. ''There was certainly an electricity that you could feel with people running all around.'' 
 The exchange's neighborhood is transforming just as quickly. Only a few major financial firms, like Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York, still maintain headquarters on or near Wall Street. 
 The blocks nearby, once filled with investment houses, are now home to apartments and luxury goods stores like Tiffany and Hermes.
 The decline in activity at the exchange's headquarters at 11 Wall Street is palpable. Tourists no longer queue up by the hundreds to survey the floor from the visitors' gallery or watch the ceremonial ringing of the opening and closing bells. Excluded for security reasons since 9/11, they can only wander by the building that has long symbolized the heart of American commerce. 
 If they could get inside, they would see that a once-vital organ has been reduced to a reliable backdrop for financial shows on cable. Camera crews flocked there again on Tuesday to capture the reaction to the lowering of interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
 But even on its busiest days, the trading floor is a sideshow compared with the center-ring attraction it was several years ago. Most of the action in shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange happens electronically, between the computers of traders at brokerage houses, mutual fund companies and home offices in spare bedrooms.
 The instantaneous execution of trades those computers allow has diminished the value of much of what the humans on the floor used to do. For the last several months, the floor has accounted for less than half of the trading in the 2,700 stocks listed on the exchange. Three years ago, that share was about 80 percent.
 ''The floor as we knew it is dead,'' said James J. Angel, an associate professor of finance at Georgetown University. ''The old days when Billy would trade with Vinny and swap information about orders so that they could get a better price for their customer are gone.''
 At the core of the old system was a small army of specialists, who staffed trading posts and were responsible for maintaining orderly markets in particular stocks. The specialists stand ready to buy or sell stocks with their own money, if necessary. But lately, that need arises less and less often. 
 This summer, specialists were involved in less than one of every 30 trades, down from about one of every seven just five years ago, according to exchange statistics. Brokers on the floor, who carry out customers' orders to buy and sell shares, handled an additional four of those 30 trades. The other 25 were without a middleman.
 With demand for their services dwindling, the remaining specialist firms have been shrinking and struggling to survive. One of the more prominent firms, LaBranche & Company, reported a loss of almost $370 million in the second quarter, much of it attributed to a drop in the value of its stake in the New York Stock Exchange.
 ''Until the specialists and the brokers can make a satisfactory return on their investment on the floor, everything is in question,'' said Patrick J. Healy, the chief executive of Issuer Advisory Group, which advises public companies on how and where to list their shares for trading. ''Whether the floor can survive is a 50-50 proposition. The answer is, we'll know soon.''
 For their part, exchange officials pointed out that the exchange was just one segment of a growing, global network of trading companies. After becoming a publicly traded company itself last year by merging with Archipelago Holdings, the exchange's operator merged in April with Euronext, which owned stock and futures exchanges in London, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon.
 Officials of the New York Stock Exchange have considered acquiring the New York Mercantile Exchange, which makes markets in oil, gold and other commodities, according to city officials. But no deal has materialized yet.
 Today, what happens on the 104-year-old trading floor on Wall Street accounts for only one-tenth of the revenue of the company, now known as NYSE Euronext. 
 But exchange officials said that they were revamping their operations to make the floor more integral, not less. The opportunity to have people rather than computers make decisions on a customer's trade distinguishes the exchange from its all-electronic competitors like the Nasdaq stock market, they said. 
 ''We intend to have the floor as part of our market model as far as we can see out into the future,'' said Duncan L. Niederauer, the president of NYSE Euronext. ''There are certain things that computers can't do.''
 Mr. Niederauer said he could not predict how much of the trading would ultimately occur there, but he said he did not foresee further shrinkage of the floor. ''I don't see it getting a lot smaller than that,'' he said, referring to the two rooms that will be left after November.
 One of those rooms is the grand, original trading room that was the centerpiece of the exchange when it was built in 1903. The other is a room indelicately named ''the garage,'' which was added in 1922. The rooms that are being closed were stitched on in 1969 and 1988. A fifth room was added in 2000 by building an overpass from the floor to a building across Exchange Place, but it was closed in February.
 When that last expansion occurred, Richard A. Grasso, who was then chairman of the exchange, had bigger plans. He had persuaded the Giuliani administration to provide about $1 billion in tax breaks and other incentives toward the creation of a new home base for the exchange across Broad Street. But the Bloomberg administration scrapped that plan, which would have been one of the city's biggest offers to retain a large company. 
 Two years ago, the city agreed to provide about $650 million in incentives to Goldman Sachs to build its new headquarters near ground zero instead of moving to Midtown. Goldman, which has about 30,000 employees, is thriving now, as the exchange is shedding jobs and shrinking its presence in the city.
 Ms. Mogavero, whose husband also was a floor broker until he retired a few years ago, said she hoped that the tighter quarters would revive some of the camaraderie of the more boisterous days when brokers like her weaved from room to room. She applauded the executives who oversee the exchange for not giving up on the floor altogether, as many exchanges around the world have done.
 ''It would have been easy for them to flip a switch and say: 'Let's be electronic. Everybody go home,' '' she said.
 City officials express hope that the executives who run the exchange will find a way to maintain its image as the gold standard of financial markets, but they are resigned to its diminished physical presence and the permanent loss of jobs on the floor.
 ''The forces that will determine exactly how many people work within the stock exchange or are connected to it are so much larger than the city itself,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development. ''The city can't fight market forces. But I do feel confident that there will be a significant physical presence there. No matter what happens to the N.Y.S.E., that building, with all of the history that it contains, is still going to be viewed as the center of the financial world.'' 
 But in private, city and state officials are fretting about how ''to position ourselves to remain the center of global finance if the anchor of the New York Stock Exchange isn't there for us or doesn't have the same meaning as it has had for the last century,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City.

HEADLINE: The N.A.A.C.P. vs. 11 Lenders

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
A LAWSUIT brought by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People accuses 11 major mortgage lenders of singling out African-Americans for costly subprime loans. 
 Angela Ciccolo, an N.A.A.C.P. lawyer, and Austin Tighe, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, confirmed that some of the 11 lenders named in the suit had begun meeting with the N.A.A.C.P. to discuss the complaints. 
 ''We're so far encouraged by these lenders coming forward, saying they want to address these concerns face to face,'' Mr. Tighe said. ''But we still think the past abuses are significant, and a great number of things would need to occur to satisfy our concerns going forward.'' 
 The lawsuit --which names Ameriquest, Fremont Investment and Loan, Option One, WMC Mortgage, Long Beach Mortgage, BNC Mortgage, Accredited Home Lenders, Encore Credit, First Franklin Financial, HSBC Finance and Washington Mutual -- was announced in July.
 Since then, Ms. Ciccolo and Mr. Tighe said, three separate offices set up to field lending discrimination complaints have continued to receive ''a significant number'' of calls from African-Americans who said they had been given high-cost loans when they could have qualified for prime mortgages at lower rates.
 The suit, filed in Federal District Court in Los Angeles, cites studies from three different organizations suggesting that blacks received high-cost subprime loans at least 30 percent more frequently than whites with similar qualifications. It contends that lenders, in doing so, ''engaged in institutionalized, systematic racism,'' in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and the Civil Rights Act. 
 Lenders declined to comment specifically on the lawsuit but defended their operating methods. The response from Lisa Friedman, a spokeswoman for Washington Mutual, was typical: ''We stand strongly behind our business practices, and we maintain a comprehensive fair-lending program that proactively assesses and monitors our lending.'' 
 The lawsuit seeks but has not yet received class-action status from the court. As foreclosure rates among those holding subprime loans have soared in the last year, advocacy groups representing low-income borrowers have pointed out that many of those who held such mortgages were not aware that they could have taken out far less costly ones.
 The N.A.A.C.P. suit seeks to have lenders pay the borrowers' costs, a term broad enough to cover a wide range of remedies, including refinancing at a lower interest rate without having to pay closing costs, or paying the difference in interest charges and penalties related to late payments on the higher-cost loans.
 One unusual twist to the N.A.A.C.P. suit is that some of the lenders cited are no longer in the mortgage business, and others could soon disappear. The shakeout in the mortgage industry has forced dozens of companies to shut down, including BNC Mortgage, the Lehman Brothers division named in the suit.
 The Ameriquest Mortgage Company, one of the biggest lenders in the lawsuit, stopped accepting mortgage applications in August and is ''winding down its operations,'' Chris Orlando, an Ameriquest spokesman, said. 
 Mr. Tighe, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said that customers of out-of-business lenders may still join the suit. ''Going out of business or stopping subprime lending does not change anything,'' he said. ''We're asking for lenders to change their policies and their practices.''

HEADLINE: The Great Inflation Mystery, Still Unsolved

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AS I was contemplating the half-point cut in the federal funds rate last week, I was toying with my Sony noise-canceling headphones and they snapped apart in my fingers. I hunted around for another set of headphones and came upon an old Sennheiser pair and an old Denon pair. But their cords were so intertwined that it took me almost a half-hour to pull them apart. 
 The rate cut and the economic situation are sort of like that. All the different pieces are so tangled up (in blue) that it is hard to ever fully straighten them out. Still, I will take a stab at it with a few humble observations:
 On the plane from Atlanta to Washington last Thursday, a fellow passenger said to me, ''Ben, I'm worried about the rate cut.'' 
 ''Why?'' I asked him.
 ''Inflation,'' he answered.
 ''Don't worry,'' I said.
 That's my first point. Economics is an extremely inexact science. The more economists try to doctor it up with formulas, the clearer it is that we know very little about what causes great economic events. In particular, we do not know what causes inflation.
 For a while, we thought it was ''cost push,'' or a big increase in the cost of certain goods and services. Then we decided that it could never be cost push and instead had to be ''demand pull,'' or aggregate demand surpassing aggregate supply. 
 But then came the stagflation of the 1970s, when we had slow growth, very sluggish additions to aggregate demand and, still, powerful inflation. That was blamed (unfairly, in my humble opinion) on Arthur F. Burns, then the Federal Reserve chairman, who, it was said, created too much money to accommodate the oil shocks after the Yom Kippur War in 1973. So we went through a crushing recession and very high interest rates to wring inflation out of the system. This was a gutsy move by Ronald Reagan and Paul A. Volcker, then the Fed chairman, in every way a towering figure. 
 But then we had a very rapid rise in aggregate demand through the 1990s and very little inflation. No one ever knew exactly why. Why didn't the high demand lead to high inflation? Was it monetary policy? Milton Friedman had said that ''inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon'' and had given a famous speech about how inflation is caused and stopped.
 Or perhaps it had something to do with the famous equation created by the economic genius Irving Fisher. It held that money quantity times the velocity of money (how fast people spend it) equaled the aggregate price level times the total number of transactions. 
 This famous equation, MV = PT, had long been thought to explain everything, and maybe it did. But why, then, if M rose and V and T showed only modest growth, if any, didn't P rise? (Anyone? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?) No one knew.
 Did loose monetary policy cause inflation, as Mr. Friedman and others posited? Maybe not, because after the tech sector collapse and the terror of 9/11, we had extraordinary monetary ease, and yet there was mild inflation. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman at the time, said the reason was that rising productivity was absorbing all of that yummy monetary ease. But productivity growth was not unusually rapid from 2000 to 2006 and yet prices stayed well under control. Why didn't they rise as productivity dipped? No one knew a year ago, and no one knows now, as far as I'm aware.
 The situation became far more mysterious after Hurricane Katrina devastated the gulf coast two years ago. We have had fantastic increases in the price of crude oil (along with relative monetary ease), yet inflation has not been rampant. Why did we have such happiness with prices in the 2000s, when similar, though not identical, conditions led to such inflationary pain in the 70s? To restate, we really don't know what causes inflation.
 We do know that if the Fed starts printing money, Weimar style, and dropping it from helicopters, Bernanke style, we will probably have big inflation. Or maybe not. It may be that we can have a great deal of added rate-cutting without creating more inflation. In fact, with a severe falloff in the construction sector, maybe a rate cut will not do much to affect aggregate demand and cause inflation.
 Then the situation becomes really mysterious: if a rate cut does not stimulate aggregate demand enough to cause inflationary headaches, why will it stimulate the economy enough to make us avoid a recession? If a rate cut does not cause inflationary jitters, is it causing any increase in aggregate demand beyond a placebo effect (not a small effect, by the way)?
 The plain truth, as I paraphrase my sainted father for the millionth time, is that we simply do not know how the various parts of the monetary machine work on the economy. 
 (We don't seem to know much about how the fiscal parts work, either. Anyone who would have guessed that we could have run federal budget deficits the size of those since 2001 without major inflation would have failed any basic macroeconomics final exam in 1966. It simply was not part of any economic system we knew about. In some way, this may lend some validity to an area I am generally skeptical about: ''supply side'' or ''voodoo'' economics.) 
 So, that was a tiny bit of what we don't know. Here are some things we do know:
 First, Wall Street desperately wanted a rate cut. People on Wall Street had gone into a sort of lenders' panic as they saw the chickens of excess risk-taking come home to roost. The Wall Streeters loved the excess fees for excess risk. They just didn't like the inevitable losses of excess risk. 
 As I have said before, the actual magnitude of mortgage losses was small, but Wall Street is run by young people who panic easily at the first sign of frustration, like overtired infants. They wanted to be reassured that Mommy cared about them and would give them her breast, in this case monetary ease.
 When they got that liquidity, so to speak, they calmed down. It is a shame that we have to appease these big rich babies to keep the economy going, but they are very strategically placed big babies and they need care.
 Second, if Wall Street is happy, money flows to lenders and borrowers, and that means employment, and that means some people will be able to keep their homes. That is important. It is sad that such rich people like those we have in finance are able to be bailed out at some (totally unknown) risk of inflation. But, as I said, they are strategically located.
 Third, there are very real reasons that the stock market climbs as rates fall. Stocks are worth the net present value of future earnings. (Some say dividends.) These are discounted back to net present value at the prevailing interest rate. If that rate is lower, the net present value will be higher than it would be if the interest rate were high. 
 It's the mirror image of compounding sums into the future. The entire stock market was worth much more the instant that rates fell, by very roughly 10 percent. Of course, if they rise again in a year, we will have to do the calculation in reverse.
 ANYWAY, we really have no idea what the inflationary risks are from the rate cut. They may well be zero. We do know that it pleases those on Wall Street, if only for now. (They are easily upset and a new trick may be needed from Mommy soon.) And if Wall Street is happy, generally speaking, the economy is better off. 
 What happens after the rate cut? Who knows? The future certainly looks more cheerful on the stock exchange than it did a few weeks ago, but numbers from the real world about employment, autos and other important metrics are another story. 
 So off we go, trudging the road of happy destiny, guided by Mommy Fed, and with an eye on the rich kids on Wall Street, mindful of Bob Dylan's words that ''the masters make the rules for the wise men and the fools,'' but not quite sure who the masters may be.

In a Tough City, Almost an Adult
 To the Editor:
 As your ''At Seventeen'' (Sept. 16) series reminds us, today's students face many unprecedented challenges. They must now become adept at navigating the popular media, which at times purposefully erode the distinction between public and private life and exploit young people's willingness to participate in public discourse. 
 Fortunately, educators in independent and public schools are committed to forming strong alliances with parents to support children as they move toward adulthood. We take an interest in the social and emotional lives of young people that is holistic rather than voyeuristic, as some of the media coverage seems to have become; we provide guidance when it is clearly needed and we respect children and honor their learning process. 
 We expect children to take risks boldly, but we take responsibility for creating boundaries that allow them to do so safely. 
 As adults, we will derive more pleasure from encouraging young people to meet their potential than we would from watching as young people, real or fictional, struggle to create meaningful lives in an adult world that shows curiosity about them, but no compassion for them. 
 Stephanie J. Hull Head of the School, The Brearley School Upper East Side 
 To the Editor:
 I found your entire series, ''At Seventeen,'' to be fascinating, and it gave me hope that New York City will give rise to a wonderful generation of earnest young adults.
 I was most touched by the interview with Zy-Tasia Gaines, whose struggle of being a lesbian teenager was one I also had to endure. It is my hope that she can feel the strength and support of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community for her.
 Sophie Woolston Philadelphia
 To the Editor:
 Katherine Pak says, ''My mom doesn't have a job, but she heads a nonprofit organization that promotes awareness of Korean culture among non-Korean people.'' 
 I don't mean to be critical of a 17-year-old, but since when is heading a nonprofit organization not a job? 
 The interview with Sarah Mohess was both heartwrenching and inspiring. She was the most economically and socially deprived but also the most morally serious and intellectually sophisticated of all the 17-year-olds whom you featured. 
 Sherman L. Greene Upper West Side 
 An Active Approach to Psychic Change
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Patching Up the Frayed Couch'' (Sept. 9), about the New York Psychoanalytic Society and Institute:
 Idealization of leaders and institutes, Freud or otherwise, should always be questioned, and has led to institutional and intellectual fossilization. For many years, vital psychoanalytic debate and creativity could only thrive outside of the mainstream Freudian institutes. 
 Nonetheless, whatever the institute and the debates, contemporary psychoanalysts still share Freud's revolutionary insight that what is out of awareness powerfully affects our experience and functioning (increasingly documented by brain studies). We also share a conviction that psychic change depends on working actively in the room with the patient on the relationship with the analyst. 
 So you can playfully caricature psychoanalysis, spin the words of your interviewees and slyly equate psychoanalysis with religion, but in doing so, you miss a more profound struggle. Like New York City itself, psychoanalysis is involved in an active, lively and, at times, painful effort to maintain the best of our history while making room for the new. 
 Comparative psychoanalytic theory has vastly enriched our work, as has feminist theory, the growing body of scientific research on the brain, on human attachment and interaction. Nonetheless, like this city, we struggle to maintain our solid essence and vitality against the depersonalized corporate mall -- in our case, insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry, enticing us with images, fads and the allure of superficial quick fixes.

BYLINE: By THOMAS MALLON. 
Thomas Mallon's latest book is the novel ''Fellow Travelers.''

 BODY:
PONTOON 
 A Lake Wobegon Novel. 
 By Garrison Keillor. 
 248 pp. Viking. $25.95. 
 Garrison Keillor's last full-length fictional trip to Lake Wobegon occurred in 2001, when he cast his mind back to the town in the summer of 1956. Six years and roughly five decades later, his readers -- who in Keillor's company always feel like listeners -- will be relieved to know that in his new novel, ''Pontoon,'' the Whippets are still playing baseball; the Chatterbox Cafe and Ralph's Pretty Good Grocery remain open; the awful Magendanz family continues to be awful; and the monument to the Unknown Norwegian continues to stand a block or so from Our Lady of Perpetual Responsibility.
 The local police may not have much use for their new antiterrorism equipment, but readers who venture into Lake Wobegon in search of security or nostalgia will, as always, be brought up short by surprisingly large measures of sadness and dread. On the American continuum, this town of 900 people beside its 678.2-acre lake has always sat a little closer to Winesburg than Mayberry. Gentle humor and basic decency may light Lake Wobegon's grid, but Keillor's imagination, the town's only power source, is ever mindful of darkness within and without. 
 Lake Wobegon's population, like that of most small Midwestern towns, is aging pretty fast these days; it may say something that the central figure of this latest Keillor novel is dead from the first sentence. The details of Evelyn Peterson's passing will no doubt provide matter for dispute down at the Chatterbox -- ''Evelyn was an insomniac so when they say she died in her sleep, you have to question that'' -- but dead she surely is, and what's more, Evelyn turns out to have been not quite the woman she was thought to be. Yes, a widow for 19 years, a brisk walker, a writer of poems, a regular at both church and the Indian casino: all that can be stipulated. But it now appears that Evelyn, who liked to say that ''there's a lot of human nature in everybody,'' spent the last dozen years taking an extra helping of her own, as she resumed a love affair she'd barely gotten started, back in 1941, with Raoul Olson. Evelyn's daughter finds out, to her surprise and initial resentment, that her just-deceased mother and Raoul -- now ''a husky old coot'' with great charm, dyed hair, not much height and vitality to burn -- had been having a swell, surreptitious time on the dance floors and bedsheets of hotels from Las Vegas to Branson.
 Surely, both Evelyn and Raoul had some late-life happiness coming to them. She had spent 44 years married to the wrong man, who finally moved out when he developed a long-distance fixation on a porn star; Raoul let his own marriage collapse after the loss of his young son to leukemia. But Barbara, Evelyn's daughter, has had plenty of problems, too: her divorce; a brain-damaged daughter; the sacrifices she's had to make for the son she conceived during an affair with a Roman Catholic priest. Barbara may have a very fat and kind-hearted lover named Oliver, but her grievances and difficulties tend to crowd out incidental joys: ''She was 57 years old, eight years from retirement. She was bumping along on 25 hours a week during the school year, cooking in the cafeteria, delivering the Minneapolis paper three days a week.'' She is also struggling to quit drinking and to become an atheist, and if she hasn't exactly blamed Evelyn for her woes, she certainly resents how little attention her mother seemed to pay them.
 In the book's early chapters, Barbara appears to be little more than a self-dramatizing whiner, and a reader steels himself for what promise to be a long couple of hundred pages. But Keillor soon starts doing lovely, plausible things with this daughter, allowing her to grow in strength and sympathy (her own and ours) as she decides to celebrate the post-70 Evelyn, ''not the Sunday School teacher and Girl Scout leader'' but ''the old broad who said what the hell and took a lover.'' In conformity with the departed's wishes, Barbara will pour Evelyn's ashes into a green hollowed-out bowling ball (a present from Raoul) and have them dropped into Lake Wobegon. Actually, Barbara's son, Kyle, will drop them from a parasail -- a performance that will end up being imperiled by a burning hot-air balloon and some visiting Danish ministers out for a boat ride. Only the most skillful literary hands should attempt the combination of flat-out farce and genuine emotion; Keillor, like Larry McMurtry in ''Terms of Endearment,'' is up to the job.
 The author can be forgiven one or two internal inconsistencies -- he's performed versions of this story for years -- as well as a few personal indulgences. The last several years have been hard ones politically for Keillor (his last book of prose, in 2004, was ''Homegrown Democrat''), and in one or two of her recollected utterances he allows Evelyn to sound as if she's coming over Air America instead of ''A Prairie Home Companion.''
 At bottom this is a tough-minded book, as aware of life's betrayals and griefs as it is of the grace notes and buffooneries that leaven everyday existence. Keillor explains with harrowing economy how Barbara's ex-husband, Lloyd, crumpled into passivity (''He could outmeek anyone. ... He just sort of got smaller and smaller and then she divorced him''), and the description of Lloyd's decline is all the more effective for being placed close by two heartening lists of God's plenty: the summer sights and sounds that come to Barbara as she sits on her porch and the jumble of delightful junk she sees at a garage sale: ''a jigsaw puzzle of the 1965 Minnesota Twins, a Hamm's beer serving tray, a set of six maroon goblets with painted flowers ugly as sin.'' Keillor has always been a great cataloger, equal parts Homer and Montgomery Ward, and rarely to better effect than in ''Pontoon.''
 If anything in this novel stands between the characters and their appreciation of such bounty, it is the churches in which so much of Lake Wobegon's life has always taken place. Pastor Ingqvist may be a fine low-key fellow, straining to minister with a bit more modernity and meaning to his Lutheran flock, but his denomination comes in for holy hell, again and again, from an assortment of characters. ''That's why I love to travel,'' Evelyn writes in a letter to Barbara. ''Because I need to get away from the killers. Righteous people can be so cruel when they go after sinners and infidels, I just don't want to be around to see it. Our people settled out on the prairie because they like straight lines and neat corners. I know these people. I'm related to some of them. And sometimes I'd like to wring their necks. And then it's time to get in the car and go.''
 In old age, Evelyn has realized, ''there are no answers, just stories.'' With all their familiar elements, Keillor's Lake Wobegon books have become a set of synoptic gospels, full of wistfulness and futility yet somehow spangled with hope. This one even contains an epilogue, the closest thing to an afterlife that fiction can offer.

HEADLINE: Falling German Birthrate Dispels Baby Miracle Myth

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Sarah Plass contributed reporting from Frankfurt, and Victor Homola from Berlin.

DATELINE: BERLIN, Sept. 22 

 BODY:
In baby-starved Germany, the hip eastern Berlin district of Prenzlauer Berg appears to be nothing short of a miracle. Strollers jam the sidewalks and block the narrow cafes. The playgrounds of the largely gentrified Helmholtzplatz in the northern part of the neighborhood crawl with infants and toddlers, ringing with their cries and the creak-squeak of swings.
 Henrike Peresse, 33, at a park with her year-old son, Malo, says she feels comfortable in the child-friendly area and repeats what is conventional wisdom here. ''It's the neighborhood with the most children in Europe.'' This bold but common statement is usually accompanied by speculation that there might be something in the water that promotes the area's mythic fertility. Those who are not ready for children are even warned to steer clear.
 Treasure hunts most often end in disappointment, and this one is no exception. The Prenzlauer Berg miracle is the reproductive equivalent of fool's gold, what demographers are calling an example of false fecundity. ''If you look at the different quarters of Berlin, Prenzlauer Berg has one of the lowest birthrates,'' says Reiner Klingholz, director of the Berlin Institute for Population and Development, who has been trying to debunk the myth since late 2004 with mixed results. 
 Still, it is hard not to see the allure that some miraculous reversal of the rapid graying of its population would hold for Germany, and for other countries around the globe facing the same trend.
 A United Nations report this year called this global aging ''a process without parallel in the history of humanity'' and predicted that people older than 60 would outnumber those under 15 for the first time in 2047. 
 The twin forces of rising life expectancy and falling birthrates have accelerated the process. This is apparent from the United States, where policy makers fret over the baby boom generation beginning to retire, to Japan, which has the highest share of people older than 60 in the world. As in Japan, more than a quarter of the population in Italy and Germany is over 60, and the phenomenon extends to Poland and Russia.
 Although the German government has begun to address the issue, it was particularly slow out of the blocks in dealing with its low birthrate, and, since 2003, the contraction of its population, in that first year by just 5,000 people, but in 2006 by a 130,000. The German population stands at 82.4 million people.
 That was, in part, because almost no debate can proceed unencumbered by the country's Nazi past. Hitler's government gave medals to mothers of large families, gold for those with eight or more children. Uneasiness over the parallels kept the subject of encouraging reproduction on the back burner in Germany for years, unlike in France where promoting childbearing has long been government policy.
 This month Eva Herman, a prominent television personality and author, was fired by the network NDR for praising the Third Reich's emphasis on family and in particular on childbearing. Though she simultaneously criticized the Nazi government over all as she made the provocative remarks, her employer's response was as swift as the public outcry was loud. Yet the World War II era is of little significance to the policy decisions regarding Germany's current shrinking population, which is an economic issue today rather than a military or nationalistic one. 
 ''It has to do with our past, of course. All the political parties really didn't want to touch this issue,'' said Mr. Klingholz, the population scholar. ''In any other country where the birthrate was that low, there would have been a political outcry.''
 According to European Union statistics, the crude birthrate -- defined as births per thousand inhabitants -- has declined in Germany in each of the last nine years, from 9.9 in 1997 to 8.2 in 2006. Even after factoring in immigration, the German population is experiencing ''exponential negative growth,'' Mr. Klingholz says. The problem is not new -- deaths have outnumbered live births in Germany since 1972 -- but a muscular response by the government is. 
 Chancellor Angela Merkel and her minister for family affairs, Ursula von der Leyen, have made it a prominent issue. A program known as Elterngeld, or, literally translated, parent money, which began this year, replaces up to two-thirds of a new parent's salary to a maximum of 1,800 euros a month, about $2,530, if he or she decides to stay home. It replaced a program that only helped lower-income families with at most 450 euros, about $630, a month.
 The new program lasts for a year for one parent or 14 months if both mother and father share the time off. The government has allocated 4 billion euros, about $5.6 billion, a year for the program, which it reported fulfilled all expectations in the first half of the year, with applications rising to 140,000 people in the second quarter from 60,000 in the first. 
 The federal government will spend another 4 billion euros as part of a 12 billion euro program including city and state money to build day care centers in 2008 through 2013. Officials expect to add 500,000 slots to a total of 750,000, filling a dire need. ''That would mean one day care spot for every third child under 3 years old. Today there is one for every 10 children,'' said Iris Bethge, a spokeswoman for the ministry. 
 Ms. Bethge said the government was also working with businesses on telecommuting and flexible scheduling. And beginning in January the federal government, with European Union support, will provide money to help businesses pay for their own kindergartens.
 Thusnelda Tivig, a professor at the University of Rostock's center for demographic change, said there had been a slight increase in births in the first half of 2007, roughly 600 more than in the first half of 2006. While that is not much, and is possibly attributable to an improved economic climate, it is the medium and long-term effect of government policies that matter most. ''I'm absolutely convinced that it will have an impact, but not immediately,'' Professor Tivig said.
 Parents at Helmholtzplatz, whose incomes vary widely, expressed far greater support for the building of day care centers than for Elterngeld, in large part because of a perceived bias since the payoff is based on earnings. ''They want the rich people to have children and not the poor,'' said Catherine Girke, 37, who has a daughter and three sons. 
 ''It would be better if they focused on providing enough day care spots,'' said Ms. Peresse, suggesting that all the money should go to building centers and then subsidizing the cost for parents. ''That would be a real inducement to have children.''
 Once a construction supervisor, Ms. Peresse has stopped working for what she plans to be just a few years while she rears her son and expects to find a new career when she goes back to work, something less consuming. Her husband is half French, and they lived in France when Malo was born. France does not have all the advantages, she said, although its aggressive incentives program for multichild families has bolstered its birthrate. 
 ''I find Germany very child-friendly, much more than France,'' Ms. Peresse said. It is easier in Germany for mothers who choose to stay at home with their children, and much easier in France for those who decide to return to work, she said.
 Helmholtzplatz itself, a park tattooed with graffiti -- some of which appears to have been commissioned as art and the rest spontaneous -- provides a snapshot of the changing neighborhood around it. Prenzlauer Berg went from squatters behind often crumbling facades after the fall of the Berlin Wall to colorfully rehabbed yellow and blue buildings now considered a yuppie haven, with a Bohemian bent. 
 ''There's an insane number of children, but it makes it nice to live here,'' said Steffi Niemzok, who was sitting on a park bench eating ice cream with her 2-year-old son, a friend and his son on a bright September afternoon. 
 The baby miracle of Prenzlauer Berg seems indisputable in the rush of children on bicycles, playing basketball, or digging in a sandbox. This enclave with many artists and professionals, would be an appealing spot to find the hope of a nation, apparently more so than the immigrant-heavy Neukolln neighborhood that Mr. Klingholz says has the highest birthrate in the city. 
 Many children live in Prenzlauer Berg, even though the birthrate is below the average for the city, the country and the continent. But the number is really explained by the rush of young people who moved into the neighborhood over the past two decades and stayed put.
 They aged from hipsters with rock bands to parents with careers. There are proportionately fewer children than elsewhere, but an overwhelming number of adults are of prime child-bearing age. 
 They, rather than their children, are the phenomenon.

HEADLINE: From Russia With Cash: Seeding a Hedge Fund

BYLINE: By RON STODGHILL

 BODY:
ANDREI VAVILOV -- Russian multimillionaire, well-connected energy magnate and nascent hedge fund manager -- smiles broadly in a Manhattan restaurant as a lawyer, a lobbyist, an economist and a former congressman praise him over shots of vodka and a lavish spread of lamb, salmon and beef tenderloin.
 They toast Mr. Vavilov, 46, as an architect of Russia's fledgling market economy and a maverick financier whose philanthropic contributions to universities in the United States and abroad have produced important financial research.
 ''Congratulations on your newest venture, this hedge fund of yours,'' says Thomas B. Evans Jr., a former Republican representative from Delaware. ''I mean, I don't know much about it, but I am sure it will be a big success.'' 
 If Mr. Evans is hoping to learn more about Mr. Vavilov's new fund, the IFS Hedge Fund, he may have a long wait. Throughout his career, Mr. Vavilov's bookishness -- he is fond of wire-rimmed glasses and a buzz cut -- has belied his reputation as a shrewd back-room operator whose business and political relationships have followed a circuitous and largely silent path from Moscow to London to New York. Even by the standards of hedge fund managers, whose activities are often shrouded in secrecy, Mr. Vavilov occupies uniquely murky territory -- at the intersection of shadowy Russian oil riches and fast money on Wall Street. 
 Mr. Vavilov, who survived an assassination attempt about a decade ago while working in the Russian government, says he personally pocketed $600 million when he sold his oil company, Severnaya Neft, five years ago. Since then, he says, he has invested $200 million in his hedge fund, which he incorporated in the Bahamas in 2004. He has yet to raise money from outside investors, but he is setting up shop in New York to do exactly that -- at the very time that hedge funds, started by everyone from former Wall Street trading stars to former professional hockey players, are encountering the potentially brutal uncertainties of a national credit squeeze and market turbulence.
 In the first eight months of this year, the average hedge fund generated after-fee returns of 6.1 percent, compared with 6.9 percent during the same period last year, according to Hedge Fund Research, a Chicago firm. In each year, those returns only slightly outpaced the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, and a basket of stocks linked to the index typically carries less risk than investments in the more highflying world of hedge funds. Investors who place their money with hedge fund managers expect them to handily outperform the S.& P. 500 over time, and they are willing to cede hefty fees to them for the privilege of doing so.
 For his part, Mr. Vavilov -- who says his fund has garnered annual returns of more than 20 percent since its start in 2004 by placing global, macroeconomic bets that he declines to describe in any detail -- remains unbowed by the challenges sweeping across the hedge fund landscape. He says that he is positioning himself to play a central role in the potential privatization of a Russian government fund that holds $130 billion in oil proceeds, and that his hedge fund should be a beneficiary if that state fund is privatized. 
 He also says he brings another advantage to the table: smarts. ''We've created a strategy that allows me to get high returns without some of the risks that are associated with volatility,'' he says. ''I sleep well and don't have insomnia worrying about what's happening to my money.''
 As the prices of oil and other natural resources like nickel and aluminum have soared, Mr. Vavilov joins the ranks of wealthy Russian business titans trying to put fresh riches to work here and in other markets outside their country. They say they are doing so in order to protect assets from corruption at home and to gain financial legitimacy in the West.
 ''What you see is a glut of oil money in Russia seeking its way into calmer waters,'' says Ariel Cohen, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization in Washington. ''These Russian tycoons and oligarchs are looking to place their money in jurisdictions with more rule of law, and where they are not subject to expropriation by the state.''
 IN recent years, many of Russia's wealthiest tycoons have gone on an overseas spending spree. Some of their transactions have been high profile, like Roman A. Abramovich's purchase of the Chelsea soccer club in London and the oil giant Lukoil's purchase of Getty Petroleum, a deal orchestrated by Vagit Alekperov. Other transactions have drawn less attention, like Vladimir O. Potanin's acquisition of a 35 percent stake in Plug Power, a fuel cell developer, for $241 million this year.
 Many of the financiers behind these deals benefited lavishly from the pell-mell business privatizations of the years when Boris N. Yeltsin was Russia's president and, having weathered the tumult that followed, now either toe the line in Vladimir V. Putin's Russia or leave the country. Much of this has occurred against a backdrop of widespread graft. 
 ''There is really no such thing as local capital in Russia, only local corruption,'' says Martha Brill Olcott, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ''The challenge for Andrei Vavilov will be succeeding in a market where things are mostly black and white, instead of Russia, a country where deals are done in the gray.'' 
 Mr. Vavilov has never been charged with a crime, and he says that anyone who does business in Russia is unfairly tainted by the country's image as a haven for rampant corruption. Still, since his days serving as a deputy finance minister of Russia from 1992 to 1997, Mr. Vavilov has been saddled with suspicions that he grew rich through dishonest, insider deals. In 1997, Russian federal prosecutors began investigating whether Mr. Vavilov embezzled $231 million as part of a fighter-jet deal, according to Mr. Vavilov and others with knowledge of the inquiry. The investigation is continuing, and Mr. Vavilov has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
 ''If you succeed in Russia, everyone wants to get a piece of you,'' he says. ''Unfortunately, envy and jealousy is a big thing in my country and when you make a lot of money, people want some of it. I spend a lot of money on lawyers.''
 Mr. Vavilov brings more than attorneys to his new role as a hedge fund manager. He is also a Russian senator, with a seat in the upper house of Parliament. And he has criticized Russia's central bank as not being more aggressive about how it invests the assets in the $130 billion government fund, also known as a stabilization fund, which the country maintains to protect the federal budget from fluctuations in the price of oil.
 Along with many others, Mr. Vavilov has also advocated privatizing the stabilization fund. He is among several business and political figures in Russia angling for access to those billions, and he sees his hedge fund as a logical repository for some of that money -- as well as cash from well-heeled American investors.
 ''I am confident that there will be no shortage of money coming in,'' he says. ''I don't have to lift my fingers; people will line up to put money in. The money is the last thing that I am worried about.''
 Some people think that such confidence might be misplaced. ''It's a very tough time these days to start a hedge fund, regardless of strategy,'' says Nicole M. Boyson, an assistant finance professor at Northeastern University. ''Most investors are like, 'Yikes, why would I go into a hedge fund when I already scared of the plain-vanilla market.' '' 
 Still, some experts say, Mr. Vavilov has one competitive advantage over most hedge fund upstarts: $200 million of his own money is invested in the fund. ''Look, it's always a tough sell unless you have an angle,'' said James R. Fenkner, chairman of Red Star Asset Management, a hedge fund based in Russia. ''But guys like Vavilov didn't make this kind of money working the night shift. And to start a fund with $200 million of your own money is already a heck of an edge.''
 AS Mr. Vavilov recasts himself as a hedge fund manager, he is spending more time outside Moscow. He has also gained entree to the clubby world of top-tier hedgies. In April, for example, he flew his private jet -- a Boeing 737 -- to Las Vegas to attend an exclusive gathering of fund managers organized by Drobny Global Advisors, where he mingled with other millionaires amid conversations about such arcane investments as Turkish glassmaking stocks and Brazilian farmland. He says his taste for socializing goes only so far, however, and that he passed on participating in the conference's charity poker tournament, called Hedge Against Poverty. 
 ''It is not fun for me to gamble,'' he says. ''You know why? I always win.'' 
 He says he relishes being the outsider, a role accentuated by his strained English and need for an interpreter. Born and raised at the boundary of Europe and Asia in Perm City, a small town in the Ural Mountains, he moved to Moscow as an adolescent. He says his father worked as a patent researcher in Moscow; his mother was a construction engineer. He showed an early aptitude for math and science and, after his father died, contributed to the family finances by working as a computer programmer in high school. 
 He attended the prestigious Moscow Institute of Management, then enrolled in graduate studies in economics and mathematics at the Russian Academy of Sciences, where he received a doctorate in economics in 1987. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, several of his former academic mentors recruited him into government work -- Yeltsin made him a deputy finance minister in 1992. Just a few years later, Mr. Vavilov was overseeing major bond issues for the government, working closely with Western banks to structure the deals. He helped pushed through privatizations and a flurry of other market reforms during these years, all of which Yeltsin advocated as a means of modernizing the Russian economy. 
 Many of the Russian reforms threatened entrenched political and financial interests in the country and inevitably led to discontent. Critics in Russia and overseas have said that shady transactions followed some reforms and netted riches for insiders. 
 As an architect of reforms, Mr. Vavilov earned plenty of enemies in Russia, political analysts say. 
 ''He's a bit of a threat to the old establishment,'' says Michael D. Intriligator, a specialist in Russian economic policy at the Milken Institute and a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''He's a brilliant guy, but not very well liked.'' 
 Mr. Vavilov was the target of an assassination attempt in 1996 when his car was blown up in a Kremlin parking lot; he was not in the vehicle at the time. But, some people say, he still has enemies. ''I still don't think he has an appreciation of how many people are out for him,'' says Ms. Olcott of the Carnegie Endowment.
 When he left the finance ministry in 1997, he founded the Institute for Financial Studies, a Moscow-based research group that today employs 15 specialists in macroeconomic theory and finance. Among its missions has been creation of sophisticated financial models that he says form the core of his hedge fund strategies. He says the work has led to improvements in assessing risks in global currency and derivatives markets. 
 After gaining a seat on the board of Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, he bought a controlling stake in Severnaya Neft, a small independent Russian oil company on the brink of bankruptcy, with, he says, a $25 million private bank loan collateralized by the company's assets. He says that under his stewardship, which included extensive cost cuts, the company invested heavily in oil production. Its reserves nearly doubled, he says, after it tapped into four promising oil fields in western Siberia. In 2002, Mr. Vavilov sold Severnaya to a major Russian oil company, Rosneft, for $600 million -- in cash, he notes.
 ''It was a big achievement for me from all points of view,'' he said. ''When I bought the company, nobody even took it seriously. It became one of the fastest-growing companies in the country.''
 Shortly after selling his company in 2002, he was elected to his senate seat as a representative of Penza, a city southeast of Moscow. The transition, some of his political critics in the Russian press have speculated, was shrewdly calculated -- anyone who has a seat in the Russian Parliament is immune from prosecution. But Mr. Vavilov scoffs at that notion.
 ''I joined the senate because I like to work for the public, not just in business,'' he says. ''The public interest is more important to me.''
 Some hedge fund managers question whether his plate -- filled as it is with politics, philanthropy and constant travel -- is too full to fight it out with some of the sharks prowling the waters in the industry. As Mr. Fenkner of Red Star says of Mr. Vavilov: ''He's not as hungry as most hedge fund managers are.'' 
 Mr. Vavilov enjoys all of the accouterments available to millionaires. He has a palatial Moscow home -- equipped with an underground tunnel connecting it to his research center offices -- as well as a residence in Monaco. His wife, Maryana Tsaregradskaya, is a Russian actress, and the couple, who have been married 13 years, have a 2 1/2-year-old daughter. Mr. Vavilov sold his Beverly Hills home for $13.5 million a few months ago and is shopping for a home in Manhattan. So far, he says, he is leaning toward a penthouse in the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle.
 ''I'm not hungry, I'm O.K.,'' he says. ''I'm lucky enough to support my family. But I strongly believe in my ideas.''
 His grand idea about Russia is that its government, long smothered beneath an unmanageable pile of foreign and domestic debt, is now contending with a very different issue. ''The biggest problem in Russia isn't debt, it's surplus,'' he says.
 Thanks to rising oil prices, Russia has $130 billion in the stabilization fund at a time of heated debate among the country's leaders and economists over how to avert a pension crisis. According to government estimates, its population of working-age adults is shrinking and may fall to 108 million from its current 140 million over the next two decades, a result of fast-declining birth rates and higher death rates among the working class, primarily men. 
 AS a result, Russian leaders are debating about how to fix the country's pay-as-you-go pension system, from collecting unpaid taxes from businesses to more radical measures that would shift the country away from a state-guaranteed program. Mr. Putin has even encouraged larger family sizes to bolster the working-age population.
 Yet few in Russia have been more critical of the current system -- or strident about how to fix it -- than Mr. Vavilov. He has pressed his case for pension reform at international conferences and on the op-ed pages of Moscow newspapers. He argues that the $130 billion fund could be more effectively invested in order to shore up the pension fund's finances.
 ''This money is basically under a mattress now,'' he says. ''Figuring out how to invest this money should be the main goal of this administration.''
 He is urging the Russian government to invest the stabilization fund's assets in the capital markets, using strategies developed at his research organization and which he says he has put towork in his hedge fund. Some analysts think that a more sophisticated approach in how the stabilization fund handles its assets is long overdue, and they say Mr. Vavilov's thoughts are worth considering.
 ''You don't necessarily think of Russians as savvy investors,'' says Barry W. Ickes, a professor at Pennsylvania State University and financial director at the New Economic School in Moscow. ''They have tended to be very insular and domestic with their wealth. His ideas are very intriguing.'' 
 And if his hedge fund doesn't wind up being a receptacle for pension fund proceeds, how will Mr. Vavilov raise the money he needs to give his fledgling venture a boost? In response, he, well, hedges. ''Right now, I'm talking to everyone,'' he says. ''It's like a beauty contest.''

HEADLINE: Domestic Help

BYLINE: By LUCY KAYLIN. 
Lucy Kaylin is the executive editor of Marie Claire magazine and the author of ''The Perfect Stranger: The Truth About Mothers and Nannies.''

 BODY:
THE movie version of ''The Nanny Diaries,'' which opened recently, is full of witty little touches, like the red neon umbrella affixed to a building in downtown New York that morphs into a real one, the type Mary Poppins might hold aloft. And yet what makes the movie pleasantly diverting is also what makes it a sham. The vast majority of us who employ nannies simply aren't guilty of the status-choked buffoonery and neglect that provide the film its jokes.
 Indeed, the mom (played by Laura Linney) who hires a pair of rarefied French mimes to be the entertainment at her little boy's birthday party just isn't typical. Nor is her put-upon nanny, a lusciously diffident college graduate played by Scarlett Johansson who doesn't come from money but nonetheless sees this job as a lark -- a temporary gig, akin to backpacking across Europe for a summer. 
 Meanwhile, the real nannies, particularly those in the city and the metropolitan area, tend to come from difficult circumstances in the Caribbean, the Philippines, Central and South America and Africa. Some have been chased here by wars and economic collapse. Often they are middle-aged, having left their own children a decade ago or more, providing for them by caring for others and sending part of their modest earnings back home. 
 Unlike the cinematic nanny whose woes are soothed by a doting young man who conveniently lives in her employers' building, many New York nannies go it alone, their marriages early casualties of the distance and upheaval. Their lives are not the sexy stuff of Hollywood movies. And yet the issue of how household workers are treated in this country is increasingly becoming a heated one. 
 Historically, domestic workers (a designation that includes housekeepers and people who care for the elderly, as well as those who look after young children) have been notably excluded from federal and state labor protections. The rationale is that this is an informal arrangement, and a private home with a minimal number of employees doesn't qualify as a workplace, subject to enforceable regulations. As such, household employers have never been bound by law to provide proper compensation, vacation and severance. They have been bound only by their conscience. 
 Backed by the grass-roots advocacy group Domestic Workers United, as well as Assemblyman Keith Wright, a Manhattan Democrat who is the grandson of domestic workers, a bill of rights has recently come before the state Legislature. The bill's provisions include five paid personal days for the state's 200,000 domestic workers, as well as five paid sick days, nine paid holidays, at least one day off a week, four weeks of vacation after five years of service, 21 days notice before termination, and severance. This is the third time since 2004 that the bill has been introduced, and the first time it has made significant progress in the State Senate and Assembly, clearing the labor committee last June.
 Given that nannies perform what, for many of us, is the most important job in the world, it seems odd that doing right by them in society as a whole -- that is, making sure that they are comfortable, well compensated and respected -- has been so difficult. Surely that has much to do with the very private, idiosyncratic nature of the work: How do you regulate a job that is so much about tickles and burps and dirty diapers and hugs? 
 But it also owes to the widespread ambivalence we feel about turning over the care of our offspring to a stranger while we go off to earn and schmooze and fly to Dallas for a company party. The relationships, even the best of them, are fraught; denial is rampant. At bottom, to acknowledge domestic workers as a labor force with demands, rights and recourse means accepting the degree to which you have outsourced the care of your child.
 The best way to cope? I'd argue for coming clean. 
 If you've hired a nanny, embrace that fact. Treat her like a valued employee and pay her on the books -- that is, pay your portion of her Social Security, Medicare, federal and state unemployment and disability taxes. And help her gain protections and the attendant sense of self-respect by supporting the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights. Any parent knows how grueling an unremitting day, week or year with a toddler can be; don't support the fiction that this is somehow not real work. 
 And if you are still undecided, think about the picturesque conclusion of ''The Nanny Diaries,'' as our heroine dines on a city rooftop with her ''Harvard hottie,'' having turned her back on child care while preparing to embark on a post-graduate anthropology program. The real nannies aren't likely to have that chance -- but there is still a chance that they can finish out their careers without feeling that they've been had.

Business School, or Quicker Riches?
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Bye, Bye B-School'' (Sept. 16): 
 History is full of stories about individuals who opt for short-term gains over long-term growth. But it is oversimplification to frame the choice of whether to pursue an M.B.A. as being only about foregone compensation. M.B.A.-granting institutions exist to raise the standards of management as a profession, and to provide an educational context that cultivates not only analytical skills, but also leadership abilities. 
 In this context, future managers learn to formulate and articulate a vision that inspires, to work well in groups, to develop the employees for which they will be responsible and, ultimately, to leave an organization stronger than when they enter it. 
 In effect, the decision to pursue an M.B.A. is as much about what one can give to an organization as it is about what one can get. It is incumbent on those of us in business and management schools to stay focused on our higher aspirations for the management profession, while ensuring that our programs create value for our students and the organizations to which they will contribute.

 A Carbon Tax
 To the Editor:
 Re ''One Answer to Global Warming: A New Tax'' (Economic View, Sept. 16), which looked at the possibility of a global carbon tax:
 In today's political environment -- a legacy of Ronald Reagan -- it's difficult, if not impossible, to raise taxes for many government activities, much less to address issues like global warming. Pigovian taxes that are intended primarily to fix specific problems are a policy wonk's delight, but in this case let's just give auto manufacturers an incentive to improve mileage and reduce pollution.

BYLINE: By STEPHEN METCALF

 BODY:
Goteborg is the ''second city'' of Sweden. It lies on the fjord of the country's west coast, at the mouth of the Gota River, and looks across the Kattegat strait to the tip of Denmark, then, peering around Norway's rump, out to the North Sea and Scotland. ''Ah, Goteborg,'' sighed the desk clerk at my Stockholm hotel, a young woman who radiated, in that Swede way, high birth weight, a sense of fair play and sensual allure, all packed into one carefree smile. ''The air is saltier there.'' 
 In Sweden, there is no mentioning Goteborg without inviting a comparison to Stockholm. ''So you are going to Goteborg?'' a tweedy young man asked me, incredulously, in an espresso bar on the capital's fashionable Sodermalm island. ''You know there is really only one street there.'' Together the two cities are like textbook examples from a birth-order study. Stockholm, the older sibling, is smart, bold, so royally self-possessed it occasionally forgets it is not an only child. Little Goteborg -- its population hovers around half a million -- is puckish, tough, creative and streaked through with a certain dark impulsiveness and self-doubt. 
 In a candid phrase that brings Americans up short, Swedes refer to Goteborg as ''the worker's city.'' One still finds the giants of Swedish industry here, like Hasselblad and Volvo, and the city has always been un-Swedish for being so frankly commercial. Perhaps this is because it has been, in a literal sense, un-Swedish: the Dutch built it in the 17th century (hence the canals), Scots made it prosperous in the 18th (hence ''Gothenburg,'' the official English version of its Swedish name) and emigre Jewish families set up a forward-thinking system of finance in the 19th. Over 400 years, its various merchants have left Goteborg both beautiful and ugly, a cross between Amsterdam and (no offense) Yonkers, N.Y. 
 For long stretches, a wanderer in Goteborg will find nothing but heartless apartment blocks or shuttered industrial waterfront, and as recently as the early 1990s, the city was known as much for anarchist street violence and a grim-reaper genre of music called death metal as for its wide canals and ye olde architecture. 
 Enduring pockets of utter charmlessness, however, have lately become the city's secret weapon. In an age of global supercapital, of triplex pieds-a-terre and velvet ropes, Goteborg has stayed, unlike Stockholm, unassuming and fairly cheap. In the past, Swedes would get their degrees here (it is the country's largest university town) and flee. But increasingly, musicians, artists, designers and shoestring entrepreneurs -- the youth-ish culture that gives a city its raffish vitality and, arguably, its economic vitality -- are staying, or returning, the latest wave of un-Swedish Swedes to colonize Goteborg for their own purpose. 
 Signs of Goteborg's newfound urban felicity are everywhere, but natives caution that while some of the revival is authentic -- that is, rooted in Goteborg's unique weirdness -- much is top-down, revivalist crap. The Kungsportsavenyn, known as Avenyn, or the Avenue, is a wide boulevard running through the middle of the city lined with sleek hotels, clubs and alfresco dining. The pride of official municipal Goteborg, the Avenue is regarded by ''real'' Goteborgians as a monstrosity. 
 (It mostly is, but even the Avenue, with its requisite Hard Rock Cafe, cannot escape weirdness: it dead-ends at Carl Milles's statue of Poseidon, whose bizarrely small genitalia is the subject of much local amusement.) Far more enticing is the Haga, a tangle of cobbled streets and 18th- and 19th-century houses converted into antiques stores and cafes. The Haga is almost oppressively pleasant; hard-core Goteborgians are suspicious of it, too, and pointed me instead to the Langgatan, or the Long Streets. 
 The Long Streets lie in the Linne district, to the west of the Haga, and they represent a bottom-up scene of the classic mixed-use variety: coffee shops, galleries, artist studios, recording labs and sex shops all sit side by side, sharing the same precious urban oxygen. Here I spent an afternoon tanking up at Cafe Publik, browsing nu jazz at the Blenda record store (record store!) and shopping for knickknacks and comics at a junk shop. 
 Despite the genuine delights of the Long Streets, I discovered something about urban authenticity: like the owl of Minerva, it spreads its wings only at dusk. That night, I went to an indie rock show in a cold-war bunker, drilled deep into the side of a mountain. The interior was sconce lit, the bands were lo-fi, and the walls were covered with photos to make Mapplethorpe blush. Surely, I thought, this was the ''real'' Goteborg? But in this city, whenever you think you've found Goteborg, someone tells you, ''No, no, that is not it.'' In the bomb shelter I was told that the real Goteborg is ''underground,'' hearing for the first time the city's most cherished metaphor. And to help me find underground Goteborg, I was introduced to Johan.
 Johan Zetterquist grew up a heavy-metal tough in rural Sweden. He studied art in Goteborg, during the dark times, when much of the city's hulking industrial infrastructure was shutting down. As the skinheads battled the anarchists in the Haga, Johan was frequenting the so-called black, or illegal, rave clubs and dabbling in the death metal scene. To make it, he had to abandon Goteborg, so he bounced around the States and Europe for years, eventually emerging as one of Sweden's most successful young artists. 
 Johan is now a doting father, and when we first met, his look summed up his many contradictions: he wore a tight blond buzz cut, cowboy boots and a herringbone blazer, sleeves scrunched up to reveal alarming forearms tattooed with the names of his children. When I asked him about his work, he smirked and said, ''You mean, what's my bag? What's my angle, man?'' Johan's ''bag'' has been a sly combination of urban-subculture-inspired installations and ''public proposals'' that are self-consciously absurd, like his plans for a permanently burning house located on the side of a highway. During a heated debate about the difference between an elk and a moose, Johan snatched my notebook and sketched, in five deft strokes, a moose. When I asked him to sign it, he stared at me with unalloyed contempt. Signed, such a picture might fetch several thousand dollars, a friend of his explained to me later. I had started to squirm at my stupidity when Johan grabbed the notebook back and signed the moose with a flourish.
 We were eating at a restaurant called Magnus & Magnus. As its boosters will (rightly) tell you, Goteborg is now vying to become the culinary capital of Sweden, with four Michelin-starred restaurants and seven of the last 12 Swedish chefs-of-the-year. Magnus & Magnus was my favorite of the city's foodie temples. It was created nine years ago by Magnus Gunnarsson, a veteran of the Goteborg club scene who, like Johan, moved away -- to the United States, then London, then Barcelona -- to establish himself but felt compelled to return. The restaurant, with its artful foie gras terrine and seared scallops (both top-notch) and decorously matched table linens, could be in London or New York, but it has a kind of chic Zen hominess that is very Magnus, and very Goteborg. In 2001 he added a club in the courtyard, which features bands and D.J.'s, and later a wine-tasting room, where regulars keep wine lockers. 
 In the middle of my meal with Johan, I wandered down to the courtyard. The space was bathed in the tawny glow of a dozen or so cloth lanterns. Up on a makeshift stage was a string quartet-cum-pop band fronted by a reedy blond singing his emo-boy heart out. The effect was thrilling: the light, the wafting bed of strings, the soaring pop vocals. ''That,'' I said to Johan excitedly back at the table, ''that is Goteborg!'' Johan studied me for a second. ''Hold on,'' he said, going to look for himself. ''That,'' he said when he returned, ''sucked.''
 Later Johan and I made our way to the outskirts of the city. ''I lived in Stockholm for 10 years,'' he said in the cab, ''and I never found an underground club. That's all I went to in Goteborg.'' The best parties, he said, were thrown at an old porn club called Nakna Sanningen -- the Naked Truth -- by ''a guy who went under the name Gandalf.'' There were whitewashed walls and beds everywhere, and, as Johan remembers fondly, tobacco being mixed with hash on the bar using a blowtorch. ''Stuff like that you would never see anywhere in Sweden at that time.'' 
 We pulled up in front of a huge 19th-century abandoned beer factory. From inside came the pulsing of dance music played superloud in very close quarters. After some haggling at the door, we got our hands stamped and mounted a urine-stained stairwell toward the music.
 There is no exaggerating the centrality of the concept ''underground'' to Goteborg's self-image. Nearly everyone I met mentioned it, often citing it as a reason for putting down roots in the city. I met a photographer named Marco Grizelj, a friend of a friend of Johan's, who had abandoned France in favor of Goteborg. ''I was looking for underground culture in Paris, and never found it,'' Marco said. ''Paris is a city for 50-year-olds eating overpriced food and marveling at Picassos. Here in Goteborg I can throw a big sound system in a car, and 15 minutes later I'm on a sandy beach playing loud music, and 200 people come.'' The police in Goteborg are relaxed (''Just don't park near a rich person's house,'' Marco said), and yet nothing feels real in Goteborg until it is made officially outlaw.
 The idea of an underground is a point of intersection between the party scene and the art scene. The city's one notable commercial gallery is the tiny but perfectly appointed Mors Mossa, in the Haga, but artists still mostly exhibit in artist-run spaces. Back in the '70s and '80s, when the Haga was an urban war zone, artists infiltrated the district's abandoned bathhouse, using the walls of the empty swimming pool to mount their works. Fredric Gunve, a theorist and conceptual artist, recalls one night when concertgoers lay down on the pool floor and listened to a psychedelic tone poem while being kneaded by masseuses. Flanking them in the surrounding neighborhoods were warring neo-Nazis and anarchists. Police were called in to body search the audience for weapons. ''The night was a chaotic mixture of love and hate,'' Gunve now recalls. Down on the dying waterfront, meanwhile, artists attacked a defunct industrial power station -- the ''Roda Sten,'' or Red Stone -- covering it in graffiti.
 Now the Haga's bathhouse has been refurbished as a swank day spa, and tacked to the rear of the Roda Sten is a sign that reads, ''It is no longer legal to paint graffiti here!'' Public officials have viewed the Roda Sten as an eyesore -- in 2006 they painted over its seaward wall just before a high-profile boat race -- or a tear down. But as one of its champions and principal curators, Fredrik Svensk, told me, the Roda Sten is ''one of the most important nonprofit exhibition spaces for national and international contemporary art in Sweden,'' adding that street art is critical to the building's identity, in spite of (because of?) the disapproval of the police and bureaucrats. In many ways, the Roda Sten is the perfect symbol for Goteborg: prettied up on the outside, while on the inside a cafe competes for square footage with art exhibits. The fugitive life is now becoming fugitive in Goteborg. Rents are rising, and ''the boom is coming,'' one curator told me, warily. ''Just be glad it is not here already.''
 Back at the beer-factory party, Johan and I spoke with Linda Tedsdotter, an artist who teaches at the university. ''The good thing is, people are staying now,'' she said. ''They no longer run to Berlin or London. But the new generation also wants to be famous. They're asking me, 'How can I get big?' '' We were standing in the bowels of the place. The music was working my chest like a defibrillator. The throbbing techno, and the dangerously close quarters, and the sun rising outside, and the implied presence of drugs, added up to a fertile aura of menace one is hard-pressed to find elsewhere in Sweden. ''I haven't been to one of these in a while. It is basically the same,'' Johan said, shrugging. ''The music is maybe vaguely more evolved.'' A student of Linda's tapped me on the shoulder. ''This,'' he said, ''This is Goteborg's underground! This is the bottom!'' Johan smiled, shook his head and raised his cup in cheers.
 On my second day in the city, at an annual art exhibition-rock concert-barbecue called Warm Up!, a young Swedish gangsta in a hoodie, stinky sneakers and aviator specs asked me if I had heard of Richard Florida. Florida is an American economist and urban theorist who believes that the presence of a ''high bohemian'' class, of artists, musicians, high-tech workers and gay men and women, drives economic growth more than sports stadiums or iconic architecture. When I called Florida, he was elated to discover that Swedish club kids cite his work and quick to return the compliment. ''Look, England ruled the world, and it was a tiny island,'' he said. ''It's possible the world is going in the opposite direction of the big state.'' Florida believes a small, well-educated, super-value-added country like Sweden could thrive and influence the world, or some portion of it, by being a knowledge-workers' paradise.
 For the world to go the direction of Sweden, though, Sweden would need to go the direction of Goteborg, not Stockholm. ''This is chauvinistic Goteborgian talk,'' Andreas Hagstrom, one of the organizers of Warm Up!, told me, ''but people here are much more open, cooperative. You can't win that much because you can't lose that much.''
 Cross-pollination has become the ethos of the city, and it is everywhere. The Lagerhuset is a former warehouse near the waterfront that now houses digital workshops, publishers, art galleries and Sweden's major intellectual journals. To discuss ideas in Goteborg is as natural as discussing the weather, and as every Goteborg artist insisted to me, critics and artists intermingle freely. If there is no art without theory in Goteborg, there is also no theory without a party. Goran Dahlberg runs Glanta, a critical-theory journal, and every once in a while throws a happening he calls a philosophy bar. ''It is like a rock-star atmosphere,'' said Dahlberg. ''People try to bribe their way in to a lecture on Hegel.''
 Everything happens in Goteborg despite, one young Goteborg artist I spoke with said, though I would put it slightly differently: everything happens in Goteborg because of despite -- that is, you collaborate, you reach across genres, you play and think equally hard, because there is so little money or fame at stake. 
 I met Freddie Wadling, the greatest of many great Swedish punk musicians, and a Goteborgian to the core, and there was only one lesson he wanted to impart to me, in his raspy near-whisper: ''The thing about this town. A musician always helps another musician. It's not like that in Stockholm, I can assure you.'' Wadling was recording that day with Silverbullit, a Goteborg band said to have ''made it.'' They've toured internationally, issued acclaimed albums and remained a staple of the local scene. When the session was over, the lead singer excused himself -- he had to leave promptly, to work the herb mixer at a potato chip factory.
 Relative poverty is still common here, and perhaps this is why, as the city grows up, the boundary between artistic and commercial life is still so porous. One afternoon I went to Bar Centro, a hipster cafe that reputedly serves the best coffee in Sweden. The coffee was delectable, but more interesting was the scene on the street outside. The D.J. from Magnus & Magnus mingled with art students who mingled with executives from the advertising and fashion firms that are now springing up in Goteborg.
 I visited with some of the city's fastest growing companies, and at each I heard the same story: in Stockholm, Stockholm is enough. In Goteborg, Goteborg is not nearly enough, and so, ironically, its smallness forces people to look first inward, then outward, to Europe and then the world. ''We chose to be centered in a second city, not a first,'' says Andreas Kittel, one of the partners of the design firm Happy F&B. Happy embodies the Goteborg paradox to a T: by thriving in a small pond, they are winning international awards and are as likely to mount an art exhibition as they are to work on brand imaging for Swedish public television.
 From out of the decay of its industrial infrastructure, the city is recreating itself as a kind of anti-brand brand. Its fashion labels -- Velour, Nudie Jeans -- have become global cult favorites and economic drivers, even as they make self-conscious use of the DIY ethic of their home city. ''We don't see ourselves as a company but as a rock band,'' Maria Levin, the founder of Nudie, told me. ''This is different from Stockholm, where one is a 'relationship professional' every hour of the day.'' Nudie is now in more than 20 countries, with estimated sales this year of $39 million.
 The partners behind Velour started out selling dead-stock clothes (never-worn vintage items) to the local bands. I asked them why Goteborg has remained so central to their aesthetic. ''We don't have famous people here, and the crappy newspapers that write about them,'' said Karl-Wilhelm Bjork, the designer of Velour's women's line. ''Here we have good rock bands. You can meet everyone in a single night out. And it is not posh.''
 As Goteborg evolves, the danger, of course, is that the forces that fed its anti-style could dissipate. In the fashion business, everyone cited the same example: Antwerp, a small city that got hot, then fizzled. (As Bjork said to me, ''Come back in five years and see if any of this is for real.'') Similarly, in the music business, people fear the specter of Seattle. Every Goteborg indie rocker I spoke with made ruthless fun of grunge. I was perplexed by the coincidence, but then Jens Lekman explained it to me. Lekman is a songwriter who has made it big by singing beautifully crafted pop songs, as catchy as they are melancholy (''Some day I'll be stuffed in some museum / Scaring little kids / With the inscripture 'Carpe Diem' / Something I never did''). ''Goteborg used to be a not very cool place to live,'' Lekman told me. ''The culture centered around shrimp and bingo. Bands played Copenhagen and Stockholm and skipped Goteborg.'' This is precisely how grunge fomented itself in Seattle: in the '70s, bands like Aerosmith would tour Los Angeles and San Francisco, skipping the Pacific Northwest. In Goteborg, as in Seattle, kids were forced to create their own scene. ''Finally, people went, 'Let's just do something on our own,' '' Lekman said. ''At that point, people embraced everything bad about Goteborg.''
 How long can Goteborg sustain its newfound energies, now that shrimp and bingo are being replaced by veal carpaccio and couture? The owl of Minerva flies at dusk: It is Lekman, not Florida, who may be the Goteborg revival's wisest philosopher. ''Goteborg is in its best days now,'' he said. ''I'm thinking about moving to Melbourne.''

HEADLINE: Sex in the Park, And Its Sneaky Spectators

BYLINE: By PHILIP GEFTER

 BODY:
WHY are the Japanese couples in Kohei Yoshiyuki's photographs having sex outdoors? Was 1970s Tokyo so crowded, its apartments so small, that they were forced to seek privacy in public parks at night? And what about those peeping toms? Are the couples as oblivious as they seem to the gawkers trespassing on their nocturnal intimacy? 
 If the social phenomena captured in these photographs seem distinctly linked to Japanese culture, Mr. Yoshiyuki's images of voyeurs reverberate well beyond it. Viewing his pictures means that you too are looking at activities not meant to be seen. We line up right behind the photographer, surreptitiously watching the peeping toms who are secretly watching the couples. Voyeurism is us.
 The series, titled ''The Park,'' is on view at Yossi Milo Gallery in Chelsea, the first time the photographs have been exhibited since 1979, when they were introduced at Komai Gallery in Tokyo. For that show the pictures were blown up to life size, the gallery lights were turned off, and each visitor was given a flashlight. Mr. Yoshiyuki wanted to reconstruct the darkness of the park. ''I wanted people to look at the bodies an inch at a time,'' he has said. 
 The oversize prints were destroyed after the show, and the series was published in 1980 as a book, one now difficult to find. Last year Mr. Yoshiyuki made new editions of the prints in several sizes, which have brought renewed interest in his work. Since April images from the series have been acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago, the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
 Mr. Yoshiyuki was a young commercial photographer in Tokyo in the early 1970s when he and a colleague walked through Chuo Park in Shinjuku one night. He noticed a couple on the ground, and then one man creeping toward them, followed by another. 
 ''I had my camera, but it was dark,'' he told the photographer Nobuyoshi Araki in a 1979 interview for a Japanese publication. Researching the technology in the era before infrared flash units, he found that Kodak made infrared flashbulbs. Mr. Yoshiyuki returned to the park, and to two others in Tokyo, through the '70s. He photographed heterosexual and homosexual couples engaged in sexual activity and the peeping toms who stalked them. 
 ''Before taking those pictures, I visited the parks for about six months without shooting them,'' Mr. Yoshiyuki wrote recently by e-mail, through an interpreter. ''I just went there to become a friend of the voyeurs. To photograph the voyeurs, I needed to be considered one of them. I behaved like I had the same interest as the voyeurs, but I was equipped with a small camera. My intention was to capture what happened in the parks, so I was not a real 'voyeur' like them. But I think, in a way, the act of taking photographs itself is voyeuristic somehow. So I may be a voyeur, because I am a photographer.'' 
 Mr. Yoshiyuki's photographic activity was undetected because of the darkness; the flash of the infrared bulbs has been likened to the lights of a passing car.
 ''The couples were not aware of the voyeurs in most cases,'' he wrote. ''The voyeurs try to look at the couple from a distance in the beginning, then slowly approach toward the couple behind the bushes, and from the blind spots of the couple they try to come as close as possible, and finally peep from a very close distance. But sometimes there are the voyeurs who try to touch the woman, and gradually escalating -- then trouble would happen.''
 Mr. Yoshiyuki's pictures do not incite desire so much as document the act of lusting. The peeping toms are caught in the process of gawking, focused on their visual prey. Alexandra Munroe, senior curator of Asian art at the Guggenheim Museum, suggested in a telephone interview that this phenomenon was not uncommon in Japan. She cited the voyeurism depicted in Ukiyo-e woodblock erotic prints from 18th- and 19th-century Japan, in which a viewer watches a couple engage in sexual activity. ''It's a consistent erotic motif in Japanese sexual imagery and in Japanese films like 'In the Realm of the Senses,' '' she said. 
 Karen Irvine, curator of the Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago, said Mr. Yoshiyuki's work is important because ''it addresses photography's unique capacity for observation and implication.'' She locates his work in the tradition of artists who modified their cameras with decoy lenses and right-angle viewfinders to gain access to private moments. Weegee, for example, rigged his camera to capture couples kissing in darkened New York movie theaters. Walker Evans covertly photographed fellow passengers on New York subways. 
 ''Like the work of these artists,'' Ms. Irvine said, ''Yoshiyuki's photographs explore the boundaries of privacy, an increasingly rare commodity. Ironically, we may reluctantly accommodate ourselves to being watched at the A.T.M., the airport, in stores, but our appetite for observing people in extremely personal circumstances doesn't seem to wane.''
 Mr. Milo also noted a connection between Mr. Yoshiyuki's work and surveillance photography. ''The photographs are specifically of their time and place and reflect the social and economic spirit of the 1970s in Japan,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''Yet the work is also very contemporary. With new technologies providing the means to spy on each other, a political atmosphere that raises issues about the right to privacy and a cultural climate obsessed with the personal lives of everyday people, themes of voyeurism and surveillance are extremely topical and important in the U.S. right now.''
 Yet earlier artists also went to great lengths to capture transgressive behavior. In the 1920s Brassai photographed the prostitutes of Paris at night; his camera was conspicuously large, but his subjects were willing participants. More recently, in the early 1990s, Merry Alpern set up a camera in the window of one New York apartment and photographed the assignations of prostitutes through the window of another. 
 Susan Kismaric, curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, agrees that Mr. Yoshiyuki's work falls into a photographic tradition. ''The impulse is the same,'' she said. ''To bring forth activity, especially of a sexual nature, that 'we' don't normally see. It's one of the primary impulses in making photographs -- to make visible what is normally invisible.''
 ''The predatory, animalistic aspect of the people in Yoshiyuki's work is particularly striking,'' she continued. ''The pictures are bizarre and shocking, not only because of the subject itself but also because of the way that they challenge our cliched view of Japanese society as permeated by authority, propriety and discipline.''
 Sandra S. Phillips is organizing an exhibition on surveillance imagery for the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art next year. ''A huge element of voyeuristic looking has informed photography and hasn't been studied as it should be,'' she said. ''Voyeurism and surveillance are strangely and often uncomfortably allied. I think Yoshiyuki's work is amazing, vital and very distinctive.
 ''It is also, I feel, strangely unerotic, which I find very interesting since that is the subject of the pictures. I would compare him to Weegee, one of the great photographers who was also interested in looking at socially unacceptable subjects, mainly the bloody and violent deaths of criminals.'' 
 The raw graininess in Mr. Yoshiyuki's pictures is similar to the look of surveillance images, but there is an immediacy suggesting something more personal: that here is a person making choices, not a stationary camera recording what passes before it. As Vince Aletti writes in the publication accompanying the current show, Mr. Yoshiyuki's pictures ''recall cinema verite, vintage porn, frontline photojournalism and the hectic spontaneity of paparazzi shots stripped of all their glamour.'' 
 Surveillance images, so far, do not have that signature.

HEADLINE: Putting Money on the Table

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS; Additional reporting was contributed by Ellen Almer from Chicago, Kristi Ceccarossi from Boston and Paula Schwartz.

 BODY:
FOR Whitney Hess, a 25-year-old software designer in Manhattan, the tension that ultimately ended her recent relationships was all right there, in the digits on her pay stub. 
 The awkwardness started with nights out. She would want to try the latest downtown bistro, but her boyfriends, who worked in creative jobs that paid less than hers, preferred diners.
 They would say, ''Wow, you're so sophisticated,'' she recalled. A first look at her apartment, a smartly appointed studio in a full-service building in TriBeCa, would only reinforce the impression. ''They wouldn't want me to see their apartments,'' she said, because they lived in cramped surroundings in distant quadrants of Brooklyn or the Bronx. 
 One of them, she said, finally just came out and said it. ''Look,'' Ms. Hess recalled him saying, ''it makes me really uncomfortable that you make more money than me. I'm going to put that out on the table and try to get over it.'' 
 But he never got over it, she said. 
 ''The sad thing is that I really liked the guy,'' she said. ''If that hadn't been an issue with him, we'd probably still be dating.'' 
 Ms. Hess's quandary is becoming more common for many young women. For the first time, women in their 20s who work full time in several American cities -- New York, Chicago, Boston and Minneapolis -- are earning higher wages than men in the same age range, according to a recent analysis of 2005 census data by Andrew Beveridge, a sociology professor at Queens College in New York. 
 For instance, the median income of women age 21 to 30 in New York who are employed full time was 17 percent higher than that of comparable men.
 Professor Beveridge said the gap is largely driven by a gulf in education: 53 percent of women employed full time in their 20s were college graduates, compared with 38 percent of men. Women are also more likely to have graduate degrees. ''They have more of everything,'' Professor Beveridge said.
 The shift is playing out in new, unanticipated ways on the dating front. Women are encountering forms of hostility they weren't prepared to meet, and are trying to figure out how to balance pride in their accomplishments against their perceived need to bolster the egos of the men they date.
 A lot of young women ''are of two minds,'' said Stephanie Coontz, director of research at the Council on Contemporary Families, a research organization. ''On one hand, they're proud of their achievements, and they think they want a man who shares house chores and child care. But on the other hand they're scared by their own achievement, and they're a little nervous having a man who won't be the main breadwinner. These are old tapes running in their head: 'This is how you get a man.' ''
 YOUNG affluent women say they are learning to advertise their good fortune in a manner very different from their male counterparts. For men, it is accepted, even desirable, to flaunt their high status. Not so for many women. 
 ''Very, very early in a date,'' said Anna Rosenmann, 28, who founded a company called Eco Consulting LA, in Los Angeles, and earns up to $150,000 a year, ''a man will drop comments on how much his sales team had made for the year, which meant his bonus was blah, blah, blah.''
 But, she said, ''that's not how we were raised.'' 
 Instead, she said, she starts out dates being discreet. ''I don't talk about myself,'' she said. ''When people ask me, I'm going to be very honest. But I definitely don't say, 'My name's Anna, I'm 28 and I own a business.' ''
 Ms. Rosenmann said that dating considerably older men helps her avoid innuendos from younger men who feel threatened by her professional success. She said that when she has gone out at night with men her own age and has to turn in early to be fresh for work, they have commented , ''Oh, Anna's an adult, she has a real job.''
 So as not to flaunt her own salary, Lori Weiss, a 29-year-old lawyer in Manhattan, has found herself clipping price tags off expensive clothes she buys on shopping binges, or hiding shopping bags in the closet just so men she was dating would not see them lying around and feel threatened by her spending power. 
 ''A lot of guys don't want to admit they have a problem with it,'' she said, referring to income disparity. ''They don't want to be 'that guy.' But I think it's ingrained.''
 She said one boyfriend ''wasn't too comfortable with me paying for things'' on dates, so to make him feel better, she would surrender to his wishes. The two would just ''stay home and cook, or just get something cheap,'' she said. ''We'd skip a movie.''
 Women said the income disparity becomes obvious in all facets of dating: where you live, what you like to do for fun and how you travel. It often comes down to minimizing who they are -- successful, focused women -- with their dates, who may be lagging a bit behind. 
 Although these women often say it is men who have issues around their higher salaries, sometimes it is the women themselves who are uncomfortable with the role reversal.
 Hilary Rowland, 28, bought her first condominium when she was 18, using money she had earned from an online business started when she was 15. Last spring, Ms. Rowland, who lives in New York, started dating a 34-year-old musician. 
 ''I usually always fly business or first,'' she said in an e-mail message. ''The one trip where he paid for the flight -- we stayed at a friend's place -- he didn't tell me the details, then flew us economy on a 6 a.m. flight with a two-hour stop-over, from Salt Lake City, to save money. I would have rather paid myself and flew business at a regular hour.'' 
 ''When we broke up,'' she added, ''he was upset that I gave my 'ex' more gifts than I gave him. Meanwhile, the only gift I'd gotten from him was a small notepad.''
 Ms. Rowland, like some other women interviewed, said that she has come to the conclusion that it would be easier to date someone in the same economic bracket. 
 ''I love traveling, going to the opera and good restaurants,'' she said. ''It doesn't have to be Per Se, but good food is important in my life. It's sometimes hard to maintain the lifestyle I'm used to when I'm in a relationship with a guy who makes less than me, since I don't want to be paying for the guy I'm with all the time.'' 
 The discomfort over who pays for what seems to be not really about money, plain and simple. Instead, it is suggestive of the complex psychology of what many of these women expect from their dates (for him to be a traditional breadwinner) and what they think they should expect (Oh, I just want him to be a nice guy). 
 On a first date at a lounge in Hell's Kitchen, Thrupthi Reddy, 28, a brand strategist in Manhattan, watched her date down several cocktails to her one, then not even flinch when she handed the waitress her credit card. Initially miffed, she recognized her own contradictions.
 ''You wonder if you're being a hypocrite,'' she recalled, ''because all date long I'm telling him how independent I was, and how annoying it was that men wouldn't date strong independent women.'' (The relationship ended after six months.) 
 Michael R. Cunningham, a psychologist who teaches in the communication department at the University of Louisville, conducted a survey of college women to see if, upon graduation, they would prefer to settle down with a high school teacher who has short workdays, summers off and spare energy to help raise children, or with a surgeon who earns eight times as much but works brutal hours. Three-quarters of the women said they would choose the teacher.
 The point, Professor Cunningham said, was that young professionally oriented women have no problem dating down if the man is secure, motivated in his own field and emotionally supportive.
 At least, that's what their responses are in surveys. Talk about the subject with women a bit older -- those who have been out of college long enough to be more hardened -- and what you hear is ambivalence, if not downright hostility, about the income disparity.
 Jade Wannell, 25, a producer at a Chicago ad agency who lives in a high-rise apartment building, started dating a 29-year-old administrator at a trucking company last year. ''He was really sweet,'' she said. But ''he didn't work many hours and ended up hanging out at home a lot. I was bored and didn't feel challenged. He would finish work at 3 and want to go to the bar. The college way of life is still in them at that age. All they want to do is drink with the boys on Saturday. I was like 'Let's go to an art gallery' and all he wanted to do was go to the bars.'' 
 TO her, his lack of income masked a greater problem: a lack of drive. 
 ''I have to say that I didn't like his career, I didn't think he had the goals of someone I would eventually like to be with or have respect for,'' she said, adding, ''It wasn't the job, it was the passion.''
 Unyi Agba, 27, an advertising executive with a small firm in Boston, almost always dates professional men, but when she goes out with someone earning less money, there is tension. ''This is a topic that's traveled in my own female circles a lot in the last year,'' she said. Across a restaurant table with a man who earns less, ''it's never explicitly said, but there are nuances,'' she said. ''Things are said like, 'Boy I'm going to be really broke after this dinner.' ''
 And her response? 
 ''Silence.''

HEADLINE: Scaring Away New York Jobs

 BODY:
Imagine, for a moment, that you are a business executive thinking about moving your company -- an upscale, high-tech company -- to New York or maybe Connecticut or perhaps California. After a little research, you find out that most of New York's system for encouraging new businesses is based on one thing: political pork. 
 There is no workable strategic economic plan for the whole state. Instead, businesses are forced to beg for a hodgepodge of handouts, each of which depends less on what the companies have to offer in terms of jobs or revenue than on which bigwigs they know in Albany. Suddenly, Massachusetts and North Carolina and Texas begin to look better and better and better. 
 For all the bellowing in Albany about the need for more jobs in the state, the noisemakers themselves are a big part of the problem, handing out inducements to companies like favors at a political gala. The net result is to reinforce the political status quo. 
 This is not by any stretch a true economic plan for upstate and downstate New York, and not having such a plan is simply a disgrace. A few haphazard attempts to ''help business'' often don't really help the economy, and taxpayers should be in full revolt about the tons of money that has been parceled out -- for Empire Zones and other economic boondoggles -- with not enough new jobs to show for it.
 Some business groups have long argued that New York loses these jobs because of its taxes. But while that issue clearly deserves more intelligent focus in Albany, it turns out that taxes are often not the deal breaker. A report from A. T. Kearney earlier this year concluded that the real problem is a herky-jerky system for bringing in new businesses that needs to be drastically overhauled. The state's current efforts to promote economic growth will mostly add rust to the upstate economy and keep downstate as the only economic engine for New York.
 One bright spot in this grim statewide picture is nanotechnology. With tons of money from the state, the Albany area is fast becoming one of the more important nanotechnology locations in the world. Former Gov. George Pataki deserves some of the credit, but attempts to clone the Albany project have not gone well elsewhere in the state. 
 The idea is to use a top-flight educational institution -- like Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute -- and get a business partner like I.B.M. to help pay the cost of creating such a complex. New York's universities are spread across the state, offering the possibility of other centers for top-flight research and jobs and economic health. State financing and tax breaks are important, but they will not really work if there is no strong business partner.
 The Kearney report notes that between 1990 and 2005, New York State lost higher-paying jobs in manufacturing, financial services and other areas. Over the same period, the state gained lower-paying jobs in education, health services and professional services. New York needs to keep those jobs, even the lower-paying ones, and add more higher-paying jobs.
 As the jobs have wandered off elsewhere, Gov. Eliot Spitzer and Joseph Bruno, the State Senate leader, have been hissing mad at each other for months now. Time to get a grip, fellows. For the sake of all New Yorkers, Albany's leaders need to grit their teeth and sit down together and start forming a genuine long-range economic plan that focuses more on bringing in new jobs than preserving their own.

HEADLINE: With an Upscale Spa, A Clash of Meanings For the Word 'Green'

BYLINE: By SARI BOTTON

DATELINE: ROSENDALE, N.Y., Sept. 21 

 BODY:
This progressive river hamlet about 90 miles north of Manhattan is home to a quirky mix of construction workers, artists and alternative health practitioners among its roughly 6,300 residents. 
 The town, a cement-mining center in the 19th century, is known for an old-time movie theater, a leafy rail trail and a pickle festival that attracts gourmands from far and wide. It also has some gaps in its teeth, including several vacant storefronts and a ghost town of a shopping plaza on its edge.
 So when new places open, they generate a buzz. But the prospect of a major new development has done more than that: It has begun to divide the community.
 Developers envision a celebrity spa and sprawling gated vacation-home community at the Williams Lake Resort, a former family-run hotel and beach club with more than 730 acres that has been on the market since 2004. The purchase of additional land would bring the total closer to 850 acres. 
 The owner, Anita Peck, has a deal to sell the resort property to Canopy Development, which is owned by a company started in 2005 by Stephen M. Case, a founder of American Online. 
 The company, Revolution L.L.C., also owns Miraval, which runs a premier spa near Tucson that Oprah Winfrey has raved about on her television show and in her magazine. Canopy, a two-year-old Northampton, Mass., builder, creates what its leaders call ''high-end sustainable resort communities.'' 
 In small meetings last year with town officials and others in the community, Canopy executives acknowledged that Miraval was likely to be the spa and resort brand. Now, they will not divulge such specifics. Canopy has not closed on the property, which is listed for $7.9 million, nor has it submitted plans to the Rosendale Planning Board. It has, however, taken control around Williams Lake by erecting gates and posting no-trespassing signs.
 ''We do have an operator in mind,'' said Tom Horton, Canopy's president and chief executive. ''That operator does not want to announce at this point in time.''
 Miraval's chief executive, John Vanderslice, did not return calls seeking comment for this article. Mr. Case declined to be interviewed.
 In the private meetings with neighbors, business owners and elected officials, Canopy unveiled plans for a gated community that would include a 100-room hotel and spa and 100 to 300 custom vacation homes starting at $1 million. Mr. Horton described it as ''a deep green health- and wellness-focused resort community.''
 Some here said that is what Rosendale needed to increase its tax base, add jobs and prompt a revival. 
 ''I think it would be good,'' said Robert Gallagher, the town supervisor. ''It would change Rosendale to some degree. You haven't had that type of clientele in town in some time, since the hotel's heyday, and this will bring that back to Rosendale. There will be an increase in traffic.''
 But many do not agree. Main Street is dotted with blue signs advertising www.friendsofwilliamslake.org, the Web site of an opposition group. The group, and others in town, worry about losing access to three lakes that have always been privately owned but open to local residents who pay $450 for annual beach club memberships. Hiking and cross-country skiing trails have also been available for a $12 day fee. 
 Some are also concerned about the development's environmental impact on sensitive land, including more than 400 acres protected under a conservation easement. And some wonder about the social impact of a gated community with potentially high-profile residents and guests, like Ms. Winfrey. 
 ''I'm hoping this project goes somewhere else,'' said Mark Morgenstern, co-owner of the Rosendale Cafe on Main Street, who moved here with his family in the late 1980s. ''As a business owner and resident of Rosendale, I think it's a bad idea.''
 He described himself as philosophically opposed to gated communities.
 ''Maybe a smattering of their guests will come and check out the town, like some kind of theme park, but I don't think they'll come down here and have a veggie burger after their spa treatments,'' Mr. Morgenstern said. ''They're most likely going to have their own cuisine, on site. And if they do make an outing, they're going to go to the best restaurants, in Rhinebeck or Woodstock, or to the Depuy Canal House in High Falls.''
 Mr. Horton said Canopy would reroute part of the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail, which goes through the property, to give the community access. He also said the company would talk to county officials about making other recreational areas public. 
 Other developers, including those proposing similar projects described as environmentally friendly, have either withdrawn local proposals or changed them when confronted with opposition.
 In August, a group called Preserve Marbletown persuaded the owner of the 147-acre Stone Ridge Orchard to scrap plans for a 350-unit housing development. The plan was to feature ''ecological agriculture'' and ''green building and clean energy technologies,'' according to the Web site www.marbletowngreen.com. It also would have led to the tearing down of most of the trees.
 ''If they're taking down an active orchard, how green can it be?'' said Manna Jo Greene, a Rosendale councilwoman and the environmental action director for Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, an environmental group. 
 This month, Crossroads Ventures L.L.C. agreed to scale back plans for the Belleayre Resort at Catskill Park in Highmount after an eight-year standoff. Crossroads cut the project size and agreed to use organic methods to maintain a golf course.
 Many Friends of Williams Lake members hope that Canopy will go elsewhere and that Williams Lake can become a public space, like the nearby Mohonk Preserve and Minnewaska State Park. 
 Nancy Schniedewind, a member of the group's steering committee, likened the advocacy movement to one in the early 1980s that discouraged Marriott from purchasing Lake Minnewaska. The lake and surrounding mountains were purchased by private foundations, which made an arrangement with the state to maintain the area. 
 ''Some people will say making it public means a loss of taxes and revenue,'' Ms. Schniedewind said. ''But Mohonk Preserve did a very intense study that found that open space and state parks bring a great deal of money to local economies.''
 But not everyone wants Canopy to abandon its mission. 
 Ms. Peck's brother, a lawyer named Edward Williams, is among those opposed to the initial plans. But he said he hoped developers would come up with something smaller and more sensitive to the environment. He has refused to sell his private cabin and 1.79-acre parcel on Williams Lake. ''I am not opposed to Canopy buying the property,'' Mr. Williams said. ''I am opposed to some of its preliminary plans, as recently disclosed to me, and Canopy's lack of sensitivity to the local townspeople, particularly the former Williams Lake Beach Club members.''
 After the Williams Lake Resort was shuttered in June, club members offered to pay for insurance and lifeguards but were turned away. Mr. Williams and others oppose plans to create beaches on wetlands. 
 ''Such a development of Williams Lake would forever destroy and, in effect, smother the present peaceful and environmentally sensitive character of this small lake,'' he said.
 While downsizing worked for the Belleayre Resort at Catskill Park, it is not clear if Canopy officials are open to that -- or to a lengthy wait for approval from the Planning Board and the state. 
 ''We've had a dozen meetings with people, and we'll probably have a dozen more before the end of the fall,'' Mr. Horton said. ''We're trying to weigh the concerns and needs of all those stakeholder groups. We don't want this to take a very long time. If we can't come to a meeting of the minds about what is economically possible and what the community wants, then there won't be a project.''

HEADLINE: A Reality Check for Home Sellers

BYLINE: By AUSTAN GOOLSBEE. 
Austan Goolsbee is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. He is advising Senator Barack Obama's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. E-mail: goolsbee@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ECONOMISTS and other humans don't always see eye to eye. ''Economists tend to think people are crazy because they won't sell their houses for less than they paid for them -- and people think economists are crazy for thinking things exactly like that,'' said Professor Christopher Mayer, director of the Paul Milstein Center for Real Estate at Columbia Business School and an authority on real estate economics. 
 With house prices falling in many markets around the nation, this particular quirk of the human psyche might end up costing the economy a great deal, Professor Mayer says. 
 Classical economics can't explain this behavior. That's because people who refuse to sell their houses for less than they paid for them are violating a cardinal rule of the market: stuff is worth what it's worth. It doesn't matter what you paid for it. But when Professor Mayer and his co-author, David Genesove, a professor of economics at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, studied the Boston condominium market in the 1990s -- scene of one of the biggest real estate busts in recent American memory -- the actual patterns of human behavior did not seem to follow the standard rules at all. 
 From 1989 to 1992, prices in Boston fell sharply, with condominium prices dropping as much as 40 percent. For a great many of those who bought condominiums during that period, selling could be done only at a significant loss. And, basically, many people refused to sell. 
 Their study, ''Loss Aversion and Seller Behavior: Evidence From the Housing Market,'' appeared in The Quarterly Journal of Economics in November 2001. The professors gathered data on almost 6,000 Boston condominium listings from 1991 to 1997 and showed that for essentially identical condominiums, people who had bought at the peak and were facing a loss generally listed their properties for significantly more than those who had bought at a time when prices were lower. 
 Properties listed above the market price just sat there. In the Boston market over all, sellers listed their properties for an average of 35 percent above the expected sale price, and less than 30 percent of the properties sold in fewer than 180 days. In other words, much of the market went into a deep freeze as many people held out for market prices that no one would reasonably pay. 
 In classical economics, that's not supposed to happen, but the episode did comport with the behavioral economics theory of loss aversion: people have a visceral -- some might say ''irrational'' -- hatred of losing money. They try to avoid doing so, even when it goes against their own best interests.
 Move ahead to September 2007. Many regions may be starting down a path like that of Boston's market freeze of the 1990s. Wherever prices decline, look for lots of sellers holding out for unrealistic prices in a vain attempt to recoup their losses. It's a hang-up that people have, and it can cause big problems. A number of houses with high prices just sit on the market while everyone waits.
 One source of difficulty arises from a basic fact of real estate economics: about half of home purchases are by people moving within a metropolitan area. If sellers can't sell their houses because they want too much for them, they also can't become buyers of new homes.
 ''The buyers and the sellers are the same people in this market,'' Professor Mayer said. ''So if the sellers price so high that they, effectively, put themselves out of the market, it shows up on the buying side, too.''
 He notes that economists at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere keep close tabs on this kind of behavior because the purchases of durable goods like furniture, appliances and televisions tend to run hand in hand with home purchases -- and durables have a disproportionate influence on the business cycle. Further, because the freezing of the housing market makes it harder for people to move, it reduces the likelihood that they can quickly relocate for higher-paying jobs. Dysfunction in the housing market can spill over into the job market, too. 
 So by being hung up about whether your condominium will sell for what you paid for it, you aren't just driving yourself crazy trying to get a buyer. You may be threatening the very performance of the economy and driving up the unemployment rate -- provided that many others behave in a similar way.
 What is to be done? Well, if you are holding out for an above-market price to recoup your losses, perhaps you would do well to hear the advice that Professor Mayer gives his own family members. 
 ''If you want to sell your house then you list it at the market price and you sell it,'' he said. ''If you don't really want to sell then don't put it on the market. But don't say you want to sell and then set the price so high that you spend the year cleaning up every morning, having people walk through your living room and look in your medicine cabinets and reject you. That's just painful -- and expensive.'' 
 His research offers a simple lesson for everyone out there waiting for a high price to push them back into the black: Get real.

HEADLINE: How Many Quarters in a Row Can Earnings Really Grow?

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com

 BODY:
 A NEW study has found compelling evidence that companies often tinker with their earnings to make themselves look more attractive. 
 The study found nearly 600 companies over the last four decades that at some point reported earnings increases for at least 20 consecutive quarters -- far more than would be expected if no earnings manipulation had taken place.
 The study, ''Earnings Momentum and Earnings Management,'' appeared in the spring 2007 issue of the Journal of Accounting, Auditing and Finance. Its authors are James N. Myers and Linda A. Myers, a husband-and-wife team who are accounting professors at Texas A & M University, and Douglas J. Skinner, a professor of accounting at the University of Chicago. 
 As long ago as the 1980s, academic researchers came across evidence that raised suspicions that many companies might be manipulating their earnings. Some companies appeared to be smoothing out their earnings streams, making them look more consistent than they really were. 
 Various researchers contended that this was surprisingly easy to do, since accounting rules gave companies wide latitude in calculating their earnings. For example, they could transfer some of their discretionary income from one quarter with particularly good earnings to a subsequent quarter in which they might otherwise have had to report a loss. Other ways included deferring expenses, or timing the sale of assets to burnish the bottom line when regular operations were losing money.
 Despite these suspicions, researchers have found it hard to actually prove that earnings manipulation was in fact widespread among publicly traded companies. It remains a controversial subject in academic circles as well as on Wall Street.
 The authors of this new study pursued an entirely different approach. In effect, they asked this question: If no companies manipulated their earnings, how many would report increases in earnings per share for at least 20 consecutive quarters? They focused on publicly traded companies in the United States from the beginning of 1962 through the first quarter of 2004, a period of more than 42 years.
 Though the professors' question appears simple enough, answering it was quite complex. They had to take into account the overall growth of the economy over the last four decades, which could make a company more likely to report profits than losses in any given quarter. They also had to deal with the tendency of certain industries to have long periods of above-average economic growth; in recent years, oil and oil services companies have been two good examples. 
 After dealing with these and other issues and assuming that no companies manipulated their earnings, the professors calculated that no more than 46 companies during that 42-year period should have had earnings-per-share growth for 20 consecutive quarters. But 587 companies actually reported such strings of growth, so the professors conclude that their findings constitute ''prima facie evidence of earnings management.'' 
 In an interview, Professor Skinner emphasized that he had no evidence of specific acts of earnings manipulation at any given company. Furthermore, he said, not all companies with 20 consecutive quarters of increased earnings will have necessarily engaged in such manipulation. But, based on his analysis, he is confident that a vast majority of them will have done so.
 He also stressed that earnings manipulation does not have to involve outright fraud. It could involve something as innocuous as postponing spending on research and development in order to avoid reporting a loss in the current quarter.
 To gain perspective on the pressures that would lead corporate managers to manipulate earnings, the professors focused on another set of companies whose earnings history would appear just as impressive as those with 20 consecutive quarters of earnings increases: companies whose profits grew just as much over a five-year period, but whose earnings growth rates were slightly more volatile. Each company in this second group reported earnings-per-share growth in each of five consecutive years, but had at least one quarter along the way in which earnings per share declined.
 The professors calculated that the average stock in the first group appreciated nearly six percentage points more, annualized, than the average stock in the second group. The researchers also found that when the average company with 20 consecutive quarterly increases finally experienced a declining quarter, its stock price fell by an abnormally large amount. 
 Indeed, they found, the plunge was steeper the longer the string of quarterly gains that preceded the earnings decline.
 Together, these various findings paint a picture of extraordinary pressure on corporate management to sustain strings of consecutive earnings increases for as long as possible, Professor Skinner said.
 He speculated that many of the managers who eventually engaged in earnings manipulation didn't take their jobs with the explicit intention of doing so. But as the earnings increased for several quarters in a row, these managers became victims of their own success, unwilling to bear the decline in their companies' stock price that would almost surely follow if they were to report a profit decline.
 THE clear investment implication is that we shouldn't bet too heavily on companies that have reported long strings of increases in quarterly earnings per share. 
 Such companies' stocks will most likely have already been bid up to too-lofty a level, and will therefore be especially vulnerable to a big decline once the string of earnings gains comes to an end.

HEADLINE: A Magnet for Students Draws a Smart Crowd

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN KILEY

 BODY:
FOUR years ago, against the advice of his middle-school teachers, Michael Weinberger applied to the Academy of Information and Technology, a public school in Stamford then just three years old and below the radar of most high-performing students. Small classes and the school's commitment to incorporating the latest technology in the curriculum persuaded him to enroll anyway. 
 Since then much has changed. The year Michael started, the school added engineering to its name, becoming the Academy of Information, Technology & Engineering, and it is now a magnet school that attracts top students from Stamford, Darien, Greenwich, New Canaan, Norwalk, Ridgefield, Westport and Stratford; last week there were 45 applicants on its waiting list. 
 Students started classes in a new $45 million, 40-classroom building next to the school's old home, one floor of the Rippowan Middle School. (The state paid for the new building and covers a third of operating costs; the city and the school district pick up the rest.)
 ''The focus is on technology, the classes are 88 minutes long, and there's more interaction between students and teachers,'' said Michael, 17, who lives in Stamford and is now a senior. ''I can walk into a teacher's office and discuss current affairs.'' 
 The four-year school, which has 500 students, caps class size at 24, although some classes have only 10 students, which was a major selling point for Michael and his parents. Administrators and teachers had steered them away from the academy ''because Michael was such a bright kid,'' his mother, Shari, said. ''But we took a risk because we believed in the school's vision of moving beyond papers, pencils and test scores to engage students.'' 
 When the academy opened in 2000, educators worked with local business leaders to develop a curriculum that would help meet a growing demand for tech-savvy workers. ''We recognized that technology would one day permeate every aspect of society and the global economy,'' Paul Gross, the principal, said. 
 ''In the beginning, high schools had given us students who had behavioral and social problems,'' he said. ''Because we are a small school, we were able to turn them around. Small is better, and this is the trend.'' 
 Students can elect to take 30 courses in subjects like engineering and new media. To graduate they must take four years of English, math, social studies and science. That is one year more of social studies and math than the state requires and two years more of science. The state does not have a foreign-language requirement but students here must develop proficiency in at least one language. They can take courses in Mandarin, Russian, Arabic, French, Spanish and Latin. 
 About 44 percent of the students are white, 27 percent Hispanic, 24 percent black and 5 percent Asian. Nearly two-thirds are male, and on average 88 percent of the graduating class goes on to college. Mr. Gross said the culturally diversity prepared students to work ''in a heterogeneous world.''
 Kay Garkusha, president of the school's advisory board and the director of investor relations at North Sound Capital, a hedge fund in Old Greenwich, said it was not just a school for ''I.T. geeks.''
 Her son Alexis, 17, moved from a public school in Greenwich to the academy four years ago, looking for smaller classes and a chance to learn Russian and Latin, Ms. Garkusha said. ''He loves languages and history, and A.I.T.E. can build on his strengths,'' she said.
 The academy's advisory board includes educators (some of them professors at area colleges), parents and executives at companies like Priceline, the online travel agency based in Norwalk; IBM, with headquarters in Armonk, N.Y.; and UBS, the investment bank, which has offices in Stamford. James Simon, 24, who serves on the board and works on information technology issues at UBS, spent senior year at the academy before graduating from the University of Connecticut. He said the academy, with classes in information technology, prepared him well.
 It was like a fraternity, he said. ''In a small school, you can connect with the professors and students,'' he added. ''It makes a big difference.''

THE BIG CON 
 The True Story of How Washington Got Hoodwinked and Hijacked by Crackpot Economics. 
 By Jonathan Chait. 
 294 pp. Houghton Mifflin Company. $25. 
 Five years into the Iraq war, it is hard to remember that George W. Bush once was controversial for something that had nothing to do with terrorism or the Middle East. But in ''The Big Con,'' Jonathan Chait reminds us that Bush will also leave an economic legacy, and it is as radical and, he argues, as wrongheaded as anything his administration has managed overseas.
 Chait, a senior editor at The New Republic who writes the magazine's TRB column, argues that a band of ideological zealots succeeded in capturing first the Republican Party and then, by poisoning the political process, Washington itself. Though their true agenda, tax cuts for the rich, was both economically unsound and politically unpopular, Chait writes, Bush and his conservative foot soldiers deceived the public and the press before pushing their policy -- four huge tax cuts in six years, in case you lost count -- on an enfeebled and corrupted Congress. 
 Any writer who accuses his adversaries of being paranoid extremist nuts (epithets like this appear frequently in the book) runs the risk of seeming like a paranoid extremist nut himself. But Chait sets out to disarm us on the first page. ''I have this problem,'' he begins. ''Whenever I try to explain what's happening in American politics ... I wind up sounding a bit like an unhinged conspiracy theorist. But honestly, I'm not.'' And he isn't. Chait attacks the tax-cutters' agenda from a sensible middle ground -- the terrain he laments has been largely lost in American politics and completely abandoned by the Republican Party. 
 By middle ground, I don't mean that Chait simply splits the difference between, say, Newt Gingrich and Robert Rubin. This is the approach, he ruefully observes, of most of the Washington press corps, and it is one of the secrets of the Republicans' success. Reporters mechanically grope for the ''middle,'' but when one party is veering rightward, the middle is, too.
 Instead, what Chait does is to examine the tax cuts on their economic merits. The debate is not new, but Chait's tale is enlivened by his account of how the G.O.P. evolved from a party of strait-laced budget balancers to extremists who resemble old-time Marxists in their rigid adherence to doctrine. 
 The story begins in the 1970s, when America's poor economy exposed the limits of the New Deal/Great Society welfare state. Arthur Laffer, a consultant who had left the government ''in disgrace,'' Chait says, after making a wildly wrong calculation of the 1971 G.D.P., argued that large tax cuts would so stimulate growth that even more revenue would flow to the Treasury. His theory was embraced by Jude Wanniski, an editorial page writer at The Wall Street Journal, who would later defend Louis Farrakhan and compare Slobodan Milosevic to Abraham Lincoln. Other devotees of Laffer's ideas, like George Gilder, were decidedly on the fringe as well.
 Chait exploits the eccentricities of this gang to cast doubt on their economics, a questionable tactic, but he rightly observes that the Laffer curve, better known now as supply-side economics, was promoted mostly by opinion writers and not by mainstream economists. In any case, Wanniski converted Representative Jack Kemp, and Kemp converted Ronald Reagan. Chait does not argue that the huge Reagan tax cuts were ill-advised. What he regards as ''deranged'' is the view that tax cuts are always and everywhere the best response.
 When Reagan was elected, marginal tax rates were 70 percent, a level Chait concedes may well have been a disincentive. Reagan cut the top rate to 28 percent, an epochal reduction that almost certainly did get capitalist juices flowing. But later, when deficits ballooned, supply-siders argued that deficits didn't matter or just explained them away. The editorial page of The Wall Street Journal began referring to ''the deficit'' in quotation marks, Chait observes, ''as if the whole thing were a liberal myth.'' 
 Reagan himself was not so doctrinaire. He eventually raised taxes, as did George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, though rates never again topped 40 percent. As long as taxes are kept beneath that level, Chait argues, they will not affect economic behavior, and the precise level does not much matter. He also argues that the Clinton tax increase, by eliminating the deficit, helped pave the way for the strong economy of the '90s -- a far more tenuous claim. It is easier to prove that Clinton did not do the economy harm than that he did it good. 
 But Chait is right on his main point: there is no historical basis for treating tax rates as the sole determinant of economic performance. Nonetheless, this was the approach of the New Right, which dutifully blamed high taxes for everything from market hiccups to the Great Depression. 
 Chait's account of how the G.O.P. banished dissent on this issue is riveting. First, Bush pere was all but purged for approving the mildest of tax increases in 1990. The 1996 nominee, Bob Dole (hardly a supply-sider), had to make a craven promise to be ''another Ronald Reagan'' -- meaning a tax-cutter. That was hardly accidental. The antitax crusader Grover Norquist spent a lot of time ''working with the conservative press to make sure that we're all thinking alike and talking alike.'' John McCain dissented from the tax orthodoxy, even voting against Bush's tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, but he was so pummeled for it that he hired Laffer as a consultant on his 2008 campaign and embraced supply-side nostrums. 
 At least the neoconservative polemicist Irving Kristol admitted to some cynicism, observing that tax cuts had obvious ''political possibilities,'' whatever their economic merits. Since tax cuts tilted toward the rich were unpopular, George W. Bush and his supporters had to argue that the rich were not in fact the main beneficiaries. Thus, under Bush, dishonesty became ''integral to the Republican economic agenda.'' As Chait baldly puts it, ''Lying has become a systematic necessity.'' 
 What Chait documents, I think, is not so much lying as hard-core partisan spinning. As with Iraq, the administration was utterly expedient in promoting its tax policy. First, the cuts were billed as a way to return ''surplus'' taxes. Then, when the surplus disappeared, they were remarketed as a stimulus measure. 
 Chait is particularly good in describing how the press, wary of seeming partisan, simply reported the claims on each side rather than analyzing them. The problem with this approach, he argues, is that the relationship of the two political parties is no longer symmetric. Democrats do not patrol their ranks for heretics or force them to sign no-tax pledges; liberal think tanks like the Brookings Institution are not devoted to a single view of taxes, as is the conservative Heritage Foundation; and liberal newspapers are far more balanced than, say, Fox News. The right's belief in its own virtue is why it often descends into paranoia, and not only on talk radio. To true believers, a defeat can only be the result of betrayal. Liberals are less paranoid, Chait argues, if only becausethey do not have the same kind of ''movement'' to betray.
 Chait overlooks that this reflects a weakness of the left. Four decades after the Great Society, liberals have yet to agree on a coherent new economic policy. Conservatives have -- even though, as Chait points out, the lucrative favors they dole out to the business lobby undermine their claim to being pure free-marketers. Their real agenda, he writes, is ''expanding the wealth of the very rich.'' But this is too simplistic; the conservatives I know seem to genuinely believe that tax cuts are good policy. Chait takes umbrage that ''crackpot'' ideas have gone mainstream, but the same could be said of any new doctrine. ''The Big Con'' gives the impression that the rightward drift in economic policy, including lower tax rates, was wholly the result of manipulation by think tanks and op-ed zealots. But the whole world has moved steadily away from liberal economic policies, toward less regulation and freer markets. Milton Friedman spread the gospel long before Grover Norquist. When the economy sputtered in the '70s, a reassessment of the old liberal consensus was inevitable and also healthy. Alas, as Chait makes clear in this highly readable and mostly convincing account, the rightward revision hardened into dogma and itself badly overreached.

HEADLINE: A Sweet 16 Party, But Not for Investors

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
Clues to how the elusive Kentucky oil-and-gas man Gary M. Milby may have spent some of the $19 million that federal regulators contend he ripped off from investors may have turned up in an unlikely place.
 Mr. Milby, who runs Mid-America Energy Inc., appeared on MTV in February, celebrating his daughter's 16th birthday on ''My Super Sweet 16,'' one of the network's reality shows, with lavish presents after she alighted from a helicopter and was transported by carriage to an over-the-top party. 
 On Sept. 14, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint against Mr. Milby and Mid-America contending that he sold interests in some 30 oil-and-gas investments after falsely telling investors they were properly registered and very profitable. The S.E.C. said he also failed to disclose that he had filed for personal bankruptcy. 
 Some $7 million was spent on purchasing vehicles and ''spending lavishly on himself and his family,'' the S.E.C. complaint contended. Mr. Milby's lawyer did not respond to a phone message asking for comment.But disgruntled investors could have been tipped off to where some of their money was being spent if they had happened to catch the MTV reality show, which chronicles parties that rich parents have for their children.
 Mr. Milby, 53, held the extravaganza at his 50-acre farm in Campbellsville, Ky. His daughter, the program shows, had already been given a $1,235 necklace during a pre-birthday shopping spree. But as the party wound down with a fireworks display, Mr. Milby had another present for his daughter: a new BMW. ELIZABETH OLSON
 MUSIC OF THE NIGHT The opening-night gala of the New York Philharmonic last week attracted many titans, some with strong ties to the orchestra, both old and new. Among those with longtime ties was Larry A. Silverstein, the developer of the World Trade Center site and a vice chairman of the gala. 
 Mr. Silverstein graduated from the High School of Music and Art in New York, where he was a member of the orchestra, conducted once by Leonard Bernstein, the Philharmonic's longtime music director.
 Performing with Mr. Bernstein ''was an extraordinary experience,'' Mr. Silverstein said. ''My playing went by the wayside,'' he added, ''but my love of music has never changed.'' 
 A new Philharmonic supporter was Paul Calello, chief executive of investment banking at Credit Suisse, which in June became the orchestra's first global sponsor. JANE L. LEVERE
 DEBT RELIEFLawrence J. Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Oracle, is known for doing things to the extreme. He owns one of the world's largest yachts, and a few of its more valuable homes. Now, it appears, he may have racked up the largest personal debt of any corporate executive. 
 According to Oracle's latest proxy statement, he has pledged 525 million shares of the company's stock as collateral for personal borrowings. Those shares are worth more than $11.53 billion and by standard practice on Wall Street, he could have borrowed from $5 billion to $8 billion against them. By contrast, Oracle's total debt is about $7.6 billion. 
 An Oracle spokeswoman declined to say how much Mr. Ellison owed or what he had bought with the money. But he should still be a very wealthy man. The proxy shows that he owns about 700 million other shares, worth more than $15 billion. PATRICK McGEEHAN
 HOUSING MARKET BLUES The subprime mortgage meltdown has brought out the industry's frustrated film directors and songwriters, as several trenchant music videos posted on YouTube show. 
 Especially entertaining are ''Mortgage Servicing Pie,'' set to the music of ''American Pie,'' by Don McLean, and ''Takin' Care of (Subprime) Business,'' set to the song by Bachman-Turner Overdrive.
 Late last week, Thomas A. Lawler, founder of Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting, an industry expert, wrote the following lyrics, with apologies to John Lennon:
 Imagine there's no subprime, it isn't hard to do. No Alt-A either, all documentation true. Imagine all the people, living affordably.
 Imagine there's no Countrywide, it isn't hard to do. No Angelo Mozilo, no rating agencies, too. Imagine all the people, living life in peace.
 You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not like Option One. New Century is now an old one, and Ameriquest is done. 
 Imagine no repossessions, I wonder if you can. No rates to reset, repayment penalties banned. Imagine all the people, sleeping well at night.
 You may say I'm a dreamer, or that I've just got an Itch. But Moody's and S.& P. look pretty bad, except compared to Fitch.''

WINDOW, window on the park, whose condominium is the fairest of them all? 
 As the apartments begin to close at the limestone-clad 15 Central Park West, at West 61st Street, the most expensive and perhaps the most celebrated new housing development in Manhattan, that is the question some strivers and dreamers may wish to contemplate.
 Is it that 10,700-square-foot five-bedroom condo assembled from two separate apartments for Daniel S. Loeb, the activist hedge fund manager, for $45 million? The apartment fills the 39th floor of what is known as ''the tower'' building, on the Broadway side of the site, with the big sky-high views. 
 Or perhaps, it is the smaller, if not exactly tiny, apartment on a much lower floor, just bought for $42.4 million, according to city records, by Sanford I. Weill, the former chairman and chief executive of Citigroup, with four bedrooms (plus a maid's room).
 Mr. Weill's apartment is a mere 6,744 square feet, and has more than 2,000 square feet of terraces atop a 20-story building known as ''the house,'' the part of the complex that faces Central Park, and whose facade echoes those of the great prewar co-ops along Central Park West and Fifth Avenue.
 The full-floor penthouse has an unobstructed view of Central Park, just above the tree line, and includes a terrace that wraps around three sides of the building. 
 When Mr. Loeb, who once worked for Citicorp, looks out over the park, he will have to look past Mr. Weill's apartment.
 ''There are two different trains of thought,'' offered Arthur W. Zeckendorf, who developed the site with his brother, William Lie Zeckendorf. ''Some people love being up in a tower where you can see for 50 miles. Some people prefer being in a smaller building with an amazing view of the park.''
 As the closings begin (Mr. Loeb's apartment is still being finished), Mr. Zeckendorf is exultant over what he sees as the critical and financial success of the project, which created buildings with large windows and many amenities, with a traditional look.
 And the design scheme allowed them to market the 43-story Broadway tower, one of many postwar apartment towers on Broadway, as if it had a coveted Central Park Address, by linking the tower through a rear drive and garden, and its mailing address, to Central Park West.
 A quick look at the math shows that although Mr. Weill paid less over all, he paid far more per square foot of space. Mr. Weill's apartment cost $6,288 a square foot, far more than the roughly $4,200 a square foot for the 39th floor in the tower far above. This holds true even when one takes into account Mr. Weill's much larger balconies. 
 Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist at Brown Harris Stevens, said that the price per square foot was the highest ever for a condo in Manhattan. The Zeckendorf brothers are principals in the brokerage firm.
 Mr. Loeb is the founder and head of the Third Point hedge fund, from which he often browbeats corporate boards, pressing them to replace chief executives and shake up companies to increase shareholder value. A profile in Bloomberg Markets magazine identified him as ''the Hunter S. Thompson of activist letter writing.''
 He signed an early contract to buy at 15 Central Park West, in the fall of 2005, while many other potential buyers were sitting on the fence, or backing out after having asked for a contract. But it is not clear whether he was able to use that to lower his price per square foot.
 Mr. Weill, according to city records, signed a contract in May 2006, soon after he stepped down as chairman of Citigroup. He ranked 262nd on the Forbes magazine list of the 400 richest Americans, with a net worth of $1.5 million last fall, and was said to be in the process of giving his fortune away to charity. He is 74 years old.
 A month after he signed the contract, he sold another Manhattan residence, a co-op at 14 East 90th Street, to Elizabeth A. Sackler, the arts patron known for her contributions to the Brooklyn Museum. Kyle W. Blackmon, a vice president of Brown Harris Stevens, represented Mr. Weill in both the sale of the co-op and the purchase of the condo at 15 Central Park West. He said he was not permitted to discuss the transaction.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 30, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Big Deal column last Sunday about the sale of two apartments at 15 Central Park West misstated the wealth of Sanford I. Weill, the buyer of one of the apartments. His net worth was estimated by Forbes magazine in 2006 as $1.5 billion, not million. (The magazine's list for 2007 was issued after the Big Deal report was written. It lists Mr. Weill's current net worth as $1.8 billion and ranks him at No. 271 on the list of the 400 richest Americans.)

HEADLINE: A Visit to the Commuting Far Reaches

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
 FOR the last 15 years, this Hudson River city 70 miles north of Manhattan has been grappling with the effects of a recession that hit harder and lingered longer than in some adjoining areas. Only now, with many New York-area buyers traveling as far north as Dutchess County to find housing they can afford, does the five-square-mile city of Poughkeepsie -- along with its 28.8-square-mile surrounding town of Poughkeepsie -- appear to be getting up off its knees.
 The prolonged economic woes have stemmed largely from the fluctuating fortunes of I.B.M., the region's largest employer. The Armonk-based company had built mainframe computers in Poughkeepsie. 
 ''Everybody was fat and happy when I.B.M. was in full production,'' recalled Charles S. North, the president and chief executive of the Poughkeepsie Area Chamber of Commerce. ''And while we watched the recession close in and some businesses shut down, we thought: 'Who cares? We always have I.B.M.' '' 
 But things changed. The arterial road ringing the city, built in the 1970s to ease traffic congestion, instead abetted urban deterioration by diverting traffic and shoppers away from the downtown to the shopping centers rising in remoter suburbs.
 In this climate, I.B.M. began its hemorrhage. In 1990, it employed 26,400 workers in the region; five years later that number had dropped to 10,100, according to the Dutchess County Economic Development Corporation. An office building bulging with I.B.M. employees emptied out, bereaving the downtown office market and further hobbling a metropolis losing residents and jobs to its remoter suburbs. 
 Fast-forward to today: Despite the downturn in the housing market, the city -- with its rich stock of historic architecture, including the Bardavon Opera House -- is bustling again with construction, along the waterfront and in older residential neighborhoods being rediscovered by buyers. Its population of 30,050, as of last year, has been growing slowly but steadily for the last six years, census figures show.
 In the surrounding town, shopping centers are being built or revitalized. Its population, too, has risen -- to 44,705, from 42,777 in 2000, according to the census data.
 Reflecting the migration to Dutchess, Metro-North Railroad's station at Poughkeepsie, the northernmost stop on the Hudson Line, has become one of its fastest-growing, according to Dan Brucker, a spokesman for Metro-North. Last year the railroad recorded 1,676 boardings at Poughkeepsie on an average workday, up 41 percent from 1994 and up 173 percent from 1985.
 Like Pat Vaughan, an accountant who works in Manhattan, many commuters consider Poughkeepsie the outer limit in terms of how far they are willing to travel for work. Mrs. Vaughan traded in a two-and-half-hour commute to Grand Central Terminal from Red Hook, a small town in northern Dutchess, for one about 45 minutes shorter. She boards the 5:15 a.m. train from Poughkeepsie and arrives at 42nd Street slightly before 7 a.m. 
 She and her husband, Ed, a foreman for Metro-North, live in the Poughkeepsie hamlet of Spackenkill, in a three-bedroom, two-bath split-level on half an acre that cost them $360,000 two years ago. They were tempted to move closer to Manhattan, to Croton-on-Hudson in Westchester County, for example, Mrs. Vaughan said, but the cost of housing there was out of their reach.
 What You'll Find
 Along the waterfront in the city of Poughkeepsie, the Westchester-based Ginsburg Development Companies is building 60 luxury condominiums in a development it is calling Hudson Pointe. In addition, a condo conversion is taking place in the Schmidt Piano Hammer Factory, built in 1880 near the river and now on the National Register of Historic Places. The developer, Village Construction Company of Salt Point in Dutchess, is planning 13 live-work lofts.
 The city also has a stock of colonials and Cape Cods near Vassar College (which is within town boundaries) that date back to the 1920s and 1930s. According to Randy Rutan, an associate broker for RE/MAX Realty Center, three- and four-bedroom homes in established city neighborhoods north and south of Main Street, within walking distance of shops, are drawing young professionals to reinvest in the area. 
 There are numerous historic districts -- not only whole neighborhooods but also dozens of sites, among them public buildings and private homes. Most are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, according to Judith Knauss, property development specialist for the city's building department. 
 Robert G. Rolison is a police detective and county legislator for District 8, which encompasses parts of the city and the town. His wife, Lori, is an interior decorator. The couple live on the south side of the city near Vassar, in a 1920s brick Federalist-style colonial with four bedrooms and two baths. Comparable homes in their neighborhood are selling for about $300,000.
 Mr. Rolison says that because shopping is close by, he and his wife can walk everywhere for their daily errands. They love the resurgence of downtown areas like Dooley Square, close to the river near the Metro-North station, Mr. Rolison said, although some problematic areas remain. 
 In the suburbs surrounding what Ms. Rutan described as ''the small knot of the city in the middle,'' there are ranches and colonials in tract neighborhoods built starting in the 1960s for I.B.M. employees. In the outlying town, on the main thoroughfare, Route 9, older strip malls are undergoing renovation and new malls are being built, affording a wide variety of shopping.
 What You'll Pay
 At Hudson Pointe, prices for waterfront condos start in the low $400,000s and reach the middle $700,000s, according to the sales office for the project. At the Piano Factory, the lofts sold within four months, said Fredric Volino, president of Village Construction; prices ranged from $200,000, for about 800 square feet, to $750,000, for 2,400. 
 In the older neighborhoods of the city, a 69-year-old brick colonial with five bedrooms and four and a half baths on 1.95 acres is on the market for $950,000, but many older homes on smaller lots can be had for $300,000 to $400,000. 
 A 10-year-old tract-style colonial with four bedrooms and three baths on a half-acre lot in the Arlington section of the town is on the market for $509,000.
 The median sales price for a single-family home in the city is $262,000, up from $245,000 last year and $167,500 five years ago, according to Ms. Rutan. In the town, the median is $289,900, up from $209,900 five years ago but down from $300,000 last year. 
 What to Do
 Both city and town have a number of public parks -- offering a skate park as well as public swimming pools and tennis and basketball courts. 
 In the city, the 900-seat Bardavon Opera House, the oldest continuously operating theater in New York State and among the oldest in the nation, has over the years showcased performers like Mark Twain, Sarah Bernhardt, the Barrymores, Gracie Burns and George Allen, Dizzy Gillespie and Frank Sinatra. This fall's lineup includes the Martha Graham Dance Company, on Oct. 19, and Dweezil Zappa performing the music of his father, Frank, on Nov. 2. 
 At the Culinary Institute of America in nearby Hyde Park, people can visit classes or dine at one of five restaurants staffed by students. 
 And in addition to Vassar, the town is home to Marist College and Dutchess Community College. All three institutions offer a variety of cultural events. 
 For outdoor enthusiasts, hiking trails abound, including 30 miles of the Appalachian Trail that pass through southeastern Dutchess County and 8.5 miles of hiking trails at the Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site in Hyde Park. For walkers in search of tamer territory, the city of Poughkeepsie offers a walking guide to its many historical and architectural sites. 
 Russell and Trisha Pfleiger, who own a four-bedroom, three-bath colonial in a subdivision in the Arlington section of the town, say they often hike and ride mountain bikes along the Hudson River with their three children -- Arianna, 16, Hannah, 12, and Owen, 1 -- and their border terrier, Winston. Ms. Pfleiger described the area as ''very family-friendly in term of things to do with children.''
 The Commute
 The fastest way into Midtown Manhattan is by train. The 5:15 that Mrs. Vaughn boards takes 95 minutes. Other morning trains take 15 or 20 minutes more. A round-trip ticket bought at the station during peak travel periods costs $34.00 A monthly commutation ticket bought on the Web is $345.94.
 The Schools
 Mr. Pfleiger, a semiconductor engineer with I.B.M., and Mrs. Pfleiger, a teacher's aide, said they moved to the Arlington Central School District in the town because they believed it would offer a better education than the city schools. 
 But Arlington High School, which had 211 in its graduating class this past year, failed to attain the standards of the federal No Child Left Behind Law for adequate yearly progress on state tests, according to the state. Its SAT scores averaged 468 for verbal and 495 for math, versus state averages of 491 and 505. Another local school on the failure list was the Poughkeepsie Middle School in the city school district. 
 At the Poughkeepsie High School, the average score on the verbal SAT was 524; on the math, 534. 
 The History
 Spared from battle during the Revolution, Poughkeepsie then became a kind of second state capital. In 1788, the New York Convention on Ratification, whose participants included Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and George Clinton, assembled at the courthouse on Market Street, debated and ratified the United States Constitution.

HEADLINE: Domestic Help

BYLINE: By Lucy Kaylin. 
Lucy Kaylin is the executive editor of Marie Claire magazine and the author of ''The Perfect Stranger: The Truth About Mothers and Nannies.''

 BODY:
THE movie version of ''The Nanny Diaries,'' which opened last month, is full of witty little touches, like the red neon umbrella affixed to a building in downtown New York that suddenly morphs into a real one, the type Mary Poppins might hold aloft. And yet what makes the movie pleasantly diverting is also what makes it a sham. The vast majority of us who employ nannies simply aren't guilty of the status-choked buffoonery and neglect that provide the film its jokes.
 Indeed, the mom (played by Laura Linney) who hires a pair of rarefied French mimes to be the entertainment at her little boy's birthday party just isn't typical. Nor is her put-upon nanny, a lusciously diffident college graduate played by Scarlett Johansson who doesn't come from money but nonetheless sees this job as a lark -- a temporary gig, akin to backpacking across Europe for a summer. 
 Meanwhile, the real nannies, particularly those in New York City and the metropolitan area, tend to come from difficult circumstances in the Caribbean, the Philippines, Central and South America and Africa. Some have been chased here by wars and economic collapse. Often they are middle-aged, having left their own children a decade ago or more, providing for them by caring for others and sending part of their modest earnings back home. 
 Unlike the cinematic nanny whose woes are regularly soothed by a doting young man who conveniently lives in her employers' building, many New York nannies go it alone, their marriages early casualties of the distance and upheaval. Their lives are not the sexy stuff of Hollywood movies. And yet the issue of how household workers are treated in this country is increasingly becoming a heated one. 
 Historically, domestic workers (a designation that includes housekeepers and people who care for the elderly, as well as those who look after young children) have been notably excluded from federal and state labor protections. The rationale is that this is an informal arrangement, and a private home with a minimal number of employees doesn't qualify as a workplace, subject to enforceable regulations. As such, household employers have never been bound by law to provide proper compensation, vacation and severance. They have been bound only by their conscience. 
 Backed by the grass-roots advocacy group Domestic Workers United, as well as Assemblyman Keith Wright, a Manhattan Democrat who is the grandson of domestic workers, a bill of rights has recently come before the state Legislature. The bill's provisions include five paid personal days for the state's 200,000 domestic workers, as well as five paid sick days, nine paid holidays, at least one day off a week, four weeks of vacation after five years of service, 21 days notice before termination, and severance. This is the third time since 2004 that the bill has been introduced, and the first time it has made significant progress in the State Senate and Assembly, clearing the labor committee last June.
 Given that nannies perform what, for many of us, is the most important job in the world, it seems odd that doing right by them in society as a whole -- that is, making sure that they are comfortable, well compensated and respected -- has been so difficult. Surely that has much to do with the very private, idiosyncratic nature of the work: How do you regulate a job that is so much about tickles and burps and dirty diapers and hugs? 
 But it also owes to the widespread ambivalence we feel about turning over the care of our offspring to a stranger while we go off to earn and schmooze and fly to Dallas for a company party. The relationships, even the best of them, are fraught; denial is rampant. At bottom, to acknowledge domestic workers as a labor force with demands, rights and recourse means accepting the degree to which you have outsourced the care of your child.
 The best way to cope? I'd argue for coming clean. 
 If you've hired a nanny, embrace that fact. Treat her like a valued employee and pay her on the books -- that is, pay your portion of her Social Security, Medicare, federal and state unemployment and disability taxes. And help her gain protections and the attendant sense of self-respect by supporting the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights. Any parent knows how grueling an unremitting day, week or year with a toddler can be; don't support the fiction that this is somehow not real work. 
 And if you are still undecided, think about the picturesque conclusion of ''The Nanny Diaries,'' as our heroine dines on a city rooftop with her ''Harvard hottie,'' having turned her back on child care while preparing to embark on a post-graduate anthropology program. The real nannies aren't likely to have that chance -- but there is still a chance that they can finish out their careers without feeling that they've been had.

HEADLINE: The Guilt of Having a Good Thing

BYLINE: By CELIA BARBOUR

 BODY:
ONE way or another, New York City exacts a price for the privilege of living in it. If you aren't shelling out an exorbitant pile of cash for your home, then you're probably paying in some other way -- by compromising your comfort, safety or values, for example. 
 Richard Sennett, the sociologist, is no exception. He and his wife, Saskia Sassen, a scholar of globalism, inhabit a picturesque former carriage house on a cobblestone alleyway just off Washington Square Park. 
 Their monthly rent for the two-story, 1,200-square-foot house, which is owned by New York University, is below market rates. But in the 28 years since Mr. Sennett first moved in, there's always been a hidden cost. 
 First it was the drug addicts who used his doorway as a crash pad. Now it's the guilt of living in what he describes as a ''gated community.'' Indeed, signs posted at either end of the alley forbid pedestrians from entering between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. 
 ''That's a terrible irony for me,'' said Mr. Sennett, a professor at N.Y.U. and the London School of Economics, ''because I've written about the evils of gated communities. But I'm not a sufficiently moral person to abandon this house. And that,'' he said with a laugh, ''is a moral failing.''
 It would be difficult for Mr. Sennett and Ms. Sassen, who is the Helen and Thomas Lynd professor of sociology at Columbia University and a professor at the London School of Economics, to avoid such failings completely. They have published more than 20 books and 100 articles between them, on everything from immigration (her) to architecture (him), and there are countless points of overlap between their work and their lives. For starters, they live in, and write about, cities. 
 Until this year, when Ms. Sassen gave up a chair at the University of Chicago to return to Columbia, the couple inhabited three ''global cities'' -- a term that happens to have been coined by Ms. Sassen (whose book ''The Global City'' was published in 1991). They would spend six months in London followed by six months divided between New York and Chicago. ''It seems so much more reasonable to be in just two cities,'' Ms. Sassen said. ''It's terribly cozy.'' 
 Her most recent book, ''Territory, Authority, Rights: From Medieval to Global Assemblages,'' was published by Princeton University Press last year. 
 ''I am nomadic,'' admitted Ms. Sassen, who was born in the Netherlands, grew up in Argentina and Italy and speaks six languages fluently. ''I make myself at home wherever I go.'' For her, ''home'' means one thing: ''a place where I can work.''
 ''When I go to giant conferences,'' she said, ''I go to the press room. All I need is coffee, a computer table and people who will just leave you alone. My work is my anchor. It is how I keep the rhythm of my daily life.'' 
 Mr. Sennett, meanwhile, prefers to write at a neat, trim desk tucked into one corner of the house's grandest space, a double-height living room on the second floor that is illuminated by casement windows and a skylight as wide as the room.
 ''I've spent a lot of my life in this room,'' Mr. Sennett said. ''I've written all my books here, and I've had the experience for a long time of this light. And the silence, which is so rare.''
 Mr. Sennett, who grew up in a Chicago housing project and describes himself as a creature of habit, originally found it difficult to divide his time between New York and London. 
 ''It's taken me about 12 years to arrive at the point where I feel skilled at living internationally,'' he said. ''We were constantly struggling with trivial things like 'That book is in New York City.' '' 
 Now, he said, ''we divide up our clothes so that 50 percent are in London and 50 percent in New York.'' He also admitted -- sheepishly -- to owning duplicates of favorite items. ''I have a cello here and a cello in London, which may seem over the top. But after 9/11 it became so difficult to travel with my cello.'' 
 Mr. Sennett practices every day and plays regularly with informal chamber groups in both cities; he was forced to abandon a career as a classical musician in his 20s, when acute carpal tunnel syndrome led to a botched operation. 
 Ms. Sassen met Mr. Sennett when she became a fellow at the New York Institute for the Humanities, which he had founded. She was impressed when she heard him give a talk with Michel Foucault and later was invited to dinner at Mr. Sennett's house, where she had a delightful time talking -- in Spanish -- to Jorge Luis Borges, another guest. Mr. Sennett, meanwhile, served a magnificent meal. Preparing food, Mr. Sennett said, ''is something I love.'' 
 ''I do all the cooking,'' he added. ''All the shopping. All the cleaning. My wife is worse than incompetent. She stares at an egg -- she's a professor at Columbia, and she stares at an egg as if she's never seen such an object. She loves to eat. But the kitchen is my domain.'' 
 Mr. Sennett's next book, ''The Craftsman,'' will be published by Yale University Press next year. ''It's a book about the relation between doing things physically, with your hands, and thinking,'' he said. ''We're losing that connection between physical and mental skills. Even the most abstract kinds of thinking, like mathematics, draw on something physical.'' 
 For Mr. Sennett, doing something physical is a way to find balance. Four days after touching down at Kennedy Airport earlier this month, he gave a dinner party for 10 people. He served figs and serrano ham, followed by slow-roasted mallards with wild rice.
 The next morning, Ms. Sassen flew off to a conference in Mexico City. ''I like a good comfortable plane ride,'' she said. 
 Mr. Sennett stayed home. He wrote every morning, practiced his cello and caught up with friends. ''I don't really feel anymore that I'm moving from one culture to another, because I've made a set of friends in both places,'' he said. ''Over time those friends have crossed, so a lot of my friends in London have become friends with my friends in New York and vice versa. I guess that's globalization, isn't it? On a personal level.''

HEADLINE: Why New York Stagnates

 BODY:
Imagine, for a moment, that you are a business executive thinking about moving your company -- an upscale, high-tech company -- to New York or maybe Connecticut or perhaps California. After a little research, you find out that most of New York's system for encouraging new businesses is based on one thing: political pork. 
 There is no workable economic development plan for the whole state. Instead, businesses are forced to beg for a hodgepodge of handouts, each of which depends less on what the companies have to offer in terms of jobs or revenue than on which bigwigs they know in Albany. Suddenly, Massachusetts and North Carolina and Texas begin to look better and better and better.
 For all the bellowing in Albany about the need for more jobs, the noisemakers themselves are a big part of the problem, handing out inducements like favors at a political gala. The net result is to reinforce the political status quo. 
 That New York does not have a statewide economic strategy is a disgrace. A few haphazard attempts to ''help business'' don't really help the economy, and taxpayers should be in full revolt about the tons of money that has been parceled out -- for Empire Zones and other economic boondoggles -- with not enough new jobs to show for it. 
 Some business groups have argued that New York loses these jobs because of its taxes, but a report from A. T. Kearney earlier this year concluded that the real problem is the state's herky-jerky system for bringing in new businesses. 
 One bright spot in this grim statewide picture is nanotechnology. With tons of state money, and a push from former Gov. George Pataki, the Albany area is fast becoming one of the more important nanotechnology locations in the world. But attempts to clone the Albany project have not gone well elsewhere. 
 The idea is to use a top-flight educational institution -- the Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute, for instance -- and find a business partner like I.B.M. to help pay the cost of creating such a complex. New York's universities are spread across the state, offering the possibility that other research centers could be created to provide jobs and economic health. State financing and tax breaks are important, but they will not really work if there is no strong business partner.
 The Kearney report notes that between 1990 and 2005, New York State lost higher-paying jobs in manufacturing, financial services and other areas. Over the same period, the state gained lower-paying jobs in education, health services and professional services. New York needs to keep those jobs, even the lower-paying ones, and add more higher-paying jobs.
 Gov. Eliot Spitzer and Joseph Bruno, the State Senate leader, have been hissing mad at each other for months, even as the jobs wander off elsewhere. Time to get a grip, fellows. For the sake of all New Yorkers, Albany's leaders need to grit their teeth and sit down together and start forming a genuine long-range economic plan that focuses more on bringing in new jobs than preserving their own.

HEADLINE: They're Electric, but Can They Be Fantastic?

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
ELECTRIC cars are the future. 
 That, at least, is the message automakers are sending to consumers as they trumpet big plans for cars that can bypass the gas pump. 
 Of course, backers of electric vehicles, or E.V.'s, floated those assurances in the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, when General Motors released its star-crossed EV1. Today, almost no one drives an electric car. 
 But with a gallon of premium gas topping $3 on average, and as carmakers and entrepreneurs pour money into the latest generation of electric cars, the prospects appear brighter. 
 Trading the internal combustion engine for batteries could bring well-publicized advantages: reducing pollution, raising mileage, promoting energy independence. E.V.'s and plug-in hybrids could deliver the gasoline equivalent of 100 miles a gallon or more. For consumers, that would in effect roll back the clock to buck-a-gallon gas. Car owners could save money in their sleep, recharging in the off hours when electricity is cheapest. 
 And compared with hydrogen fuel-cell cars, the infrastructure for electric cars already exists, requiring only more plugs in more places. Aside from home recharging, it would be easier to install pay-per-use outlets at curbsides and in parking lots than to spawn a network of hydrogen filling stations. Wal-Mart and McDonald's might offer convenient electricity for customers or employees. 
 Sounds good? There is one problem. There is still not a single E.V. or plug-in hybrid available that can approach the driving range, interior room and performance of a typical gas-powered family sedan, at anywhere near the price that an average consumer would pay. 
 From a technical standpoint, the Tesla Roadster may well be the most impressive E.V. yet. But this plug-in two-seater, based on the Lotus Elise, is cramped and has near-zero cargo space. Its $100,000 price is well beyond the budget of even most sports car buyers. 
 So automakers, including Tesla, are again assuring Americans that practical, affordable E.V.'s are on the way.
 Experts say the cars' arrival hinges on two make-or-break issues:
 Developing safe, affordable lithium-ion batteries lasting 100,000 miles. 
 Overcoming a psychological barrier among people who can imagine the benefits -- but who can also see themselves stranded with a dead battery and no place or time to recharge.
 As for batteries, progress has been made, but more is needed. The EV1 started with old-school lead-acid batteries; today's hybrids have more robust nickel-metal-hydride units. But the most efficient batteries are lithium-ion, the kind found in cellphones and laptops. These cells would double or triple the power of, say, a Toyota Prius battery pack, but at half the weight or size.
 Prabhakar Patil is chief executive of Compact Power, a company vying to power a G.M. plug-in hybrid based on the Chevrolet Volt concept car -- and to have them ready by 2010 or 2011. He was previously chief engineer for the Ford Escape Hybrid. 
 He is convinced that his company can bring in lithium-ion batteries on time and on budget -- and that plug-in hybrids are the necessary bridge between gasoline and pure E.V.'s. 
 ''If you had asked me even five years ago, I'd have said forget it,'' Mr. Patil said of the technology's prospects. But since Sony offered the first commercial lithium-ion cells in 1991, their costs have fallen by a factor of 12, he said. Today, California's Air Resources Board calculates that lithium-ion packs would cost $3,000 to $4,000 in mass production, cheap enough to be feasible. 
 As with most plug-in proponents, G.M. envisions its Volt as a second car in a household, the one that handles commuting and errands. The Volt is designed to travel up to 40 miles on battery power alone, delivering the equivalent of 100 m.p.g. or more. 
 The Volt's gasoline engine would be used solely to charge the batteries, delivering a total range of 640 miles. At the Frankfurt auto show this month, G.M.'s Opel division showed the Flextreme, a variation on the Volt with a small diesel engine charging the batteries.
 The issue of travel range brings up the second E.V. hurdle: the psychology of electricity. After 10 years of sales and heavy publicity, hybrids have grabbed less than 2 percent of the market. And that's for cars that don't need to be plugged in.
 That's why the plug-in hybrid ''is a great step toward a pure E.V.,'' Mr. Patil said, adding, ''You skip the gas station, save time and money, and it takes away the fear factor on the limited range.''
 Every plug-in and E.V. on the horizon still takes several hours to charge, though some new approaches are being considered. Altair Nanotechnologies of Reno, Nev., claims that its batteries can be juiced up in 10 minutes via a special high-voltage charging unit, thanks to minutely scaled lithium titanate electrode materials. Those performance claims will be tested when Altair supplies batteries for a promised electric pickup from Phoenix Motorcars.
 An interesting aspect of E.V.'s is the proliferation of small, feisty companies trying to beat the G.M.'s and Toyotas at their own game. In recent decades no upstart has survived, but Bryon Bliss, a vice president at Phoenix, said major automakers remained largely wedded to the internal combustion engine, creating opportunities for new companies with fresh ideas.
 ''The perfect storm is brewing,'' Mr. Bliss said. ''The demand is there to get off petroleum. But the big companies haven't exploited it, and there's an opening for smaller companies to fill this market.''
 Are electric cars in the pipeline, or are they still a pipe dream? Strip away the promises and the offerings are virtually nonexistent. Not a single purely electric vehicle with four seats and the ability to reach highway speeds is being mass-produced anywhere in the world.
 The glorified golf carts known as neighborhood vehicles are not street-legal in many states and don't meet the needs of most families. And while some tinkerers have turned Priuses into plug-in hybrids, most alternative-car experts consider this retrofitting to be a technical and economic dead end. 
 Despite the daunting challenges, several companies insist that the time and the technology are now right. Here are the electric cars closest to reality:
 Tesla Roadster
 With an initial 2008 run of 600-plus cars now set to begin production late this year, the Tesla has attracted unprecedented interest in E.V.'s thanks to its sexy looks, its blistering acceleration (0 to 60 m.p.h. in less than four seconds) and a driving range that was just revised upward to 245 miles. 
 The Silicon Valley start-up has benefited from tens of millions of development dollars from Elon Musk, the PayPal founder who is Tesla's chief executive and is developing his own space program; backers include Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google. 
 The Tesla has provoked a worldwide outpouring of fait accompli press coverage: the technology will put Detroit's dinosaurs out of business, it is said, and render the internal combustion engine obsolete. Yet that would be a tall order for a company with no experience in the brutal auto business, one that has yet to build its first production car, open its first showroom or build its first service facility. 
 In August, a co-founder, Martin Eberhard, was shunted aside for a new interim chief executive, and the start of production was delayed for about four months. Yet company executives said that their desire to deliver a top-quality car is the only reason for the delay. To alleviate concerns, Tesla has allowed some buyers to test-drive pre-production models and post unedited comments on the company's Web site
 (teslamotors.com).
 When I took a brief spin in the Tesla last spring, company officials did their best to deflate overwrought expectations. They are the first to emphasize that the $100,000 British-built roadster aims to prove the fun and feasibility of E.V.'s, not solve the transportation issues of average Americans. But Tesla is developing a second E.V. (its code name is White Star), a generously sized, $50,000-$70,000 sport sedan. Starting in 2010, Tesla plans to make 10,000 White Stars at a new plant in Albuquerque.
 Certainly, the celebrity-friendly Roadster is a marketing smash. But the White Star will be the real test of Tesla's technology and long-term prospects. 
 Zap-X
 The company name, Zap, sounds like something from a Batman comic. (It stands for Zero Air Pollution.) But if the project gets off the ground, the Zap-X would be one superpowered E.V., with a claimed top speed of 155 m.p.h. and a 350-mile range. While the car has been derided by skeptics as ''vaporware'' that will never see production, the Zap-X would be based on the APX concept car by Lotus, which is also building the Tesla at its Hethel, England, factory.
 The five-passenger aluminum-intensive crossover would use high-tech electric hub motors at all four wheels, delivering 644 horsepower to the ground from a lithium-ion battery pack. The hub motors would eliminate the need for transmission, axles and conventional brakes, opening up space beneath the floor for a giant battery pack. 
 On Friday, Steven Schneider, the chief executive of Zap, closed a long-brewing deal with China's Youngman Automotive Group to manufacture E.V. passenger cars, buses and heavy equipment. Mr. Schneider said the alliance opens the door to bringing the Zap-X, and possibly other electric models, to the United States by about 2010 for around $60,000.
 Chevrolet Volt
 G.M. doesn't like the Volt to be called a plug-in hybrid, since it considers the car more of an E.V. But the concept car has a tiny gasoline engine, albeit one that's used exclusively to pump electricity into lithium-ion batteries, not to power the wheels. And there's definitely a cord attached, requiring eight hours to recharge from a household plug but far less with higher-voltage current. 
 G.M. is designing the Volt to run on electricity alone for up to 40 miles. So for more than 85 percent of American commuters, the Volt would indeed work like a pure E.V., using no gasoline and delivering up to 150 m.p.g. G.M. hopes to bring a car like the Volt to market by 2011 or 2012. 
 Think City
 The Think company illustrates the hurdles faced by E.V. makers. Founded in Norway in 1990 as Pivco Industries, the company has run out of money, gone into receivership and passed through multiple owners. Now it has been revived as Think Nordic. Yet over 17 years, it has produced little of note. 
 Under Ford's ownership beginning in 1999 and driven by California's electric-vehicle mandate, the company produced 1,000 sluggish 50-mile-range Think City cars. Ford dumped the disastrous project in 2003, crushing leftover American models (as G.M. did with the EV1). Now, the company plans a second-generation two-seat Think City for Europe in 2008, powered by lithium-ion batteries provided by Tesla in a $43 million deal. The company has floated vague plans to sell the car in some American cities in 2009.
 Beyond urban use, the new model's performance may not satisfy Americans: the company claims a mere 110-mile driving range and top speed of only 62 m.p.h.
 Phoenix S.U.T.
 Looking like the offspring of a Honda Ridgeline and a Subaru Baja, the Phoenix S.U.T. starts life as a South Korean pickup, the Ssangyong Actyon. 
 Phoenix adds a tiny twist: its lithium-ion batteries are said to employ nanotechnology -- in this case, incredibly small lithium-titanate particles -- to deliver faster recharging, safer operation and longer life. Ssangyong will ship the pickups, minus a powertrain, to Ontario, Calif., where Phoenix will install the batteries and electronics. 
 Using a special high-voltage charger, Phoenix claims the truck could store enough juice in 10 minutes to cover 100 miles. (A full charge would take six or seven hours from household current.) For now, only utility companies and other fleet customers can buy one of the $45,000 sport utility trucks from the initial 500-unit run. The company plans a small public introduction in 2008. 
 Wrightspeed X1
 The racy Wrightspeed E.V. is the brainchild of Ian Wright, a New Zealander who was formerly chief engineer at Tesla. Essentially a juiced-up, lithium-ion version of the Ariel Atom tube-frame racer, the Wrightspeed is sickeningly fast. It is also stripped-down and devoid of comforts -- a track car that's nearly useless on public roads. Wright hopes to bring the X1 to market for around $120,000. But even more so than the Tesla, the only thing the Wrightspeed would solve is the need to roar into the pits for a quick fuel stop. 
 Electrum Spyder
 Another bit of California dreaming, this is a convertible E.V. from Universal Electric Vehicle of Thousand Oaks. The company, which is seeking corporate financing, claims the Electrum Spyder (estimated price: $69,900) could reach 100 m.p.h. and travel up to 150 miles on a charge of its nickel-zinc batteries. A $25,000 upgrade would add lithium-ion cells, increasing the range to 250 miles. 
 The company says it is taking orders for the car, with deliveries beginning 10 months after an unspecified start of production. The company said it was also designing a two-door four-passenger model with a target price below $45,000. 
 Venturi Fetish
 If the Tesla strikes you as common, consider the Venturi Fetish. First shown at the Paris auto show in 2004, the two-seat roadster, powered by lithium-ion batteries, has a claimed top speed of 100 m.p.h. and a one-hour charging time. The Monaco-based company says it plans to build 25 Fetishes, priced at a cool $500,000 each. 
 Tango
 It looks like a car that got caught in a trash compactor. Only three inches wider than a yardstick, the Commuter Cars Corporation's Tango is an all-electric two-seater. George Clooney, who is to get one of the first 10 Teslas sold to the general public, has reportedly bought a Tango, too.

HEADLINE: Columbus Cool

BYLINE: By MONICA KHEMSUROV

 BODY:
Most travelers don't give much thought to Ohio. But in the last few years, Columbus has undergone a transformation. By luring young professionals to its homegrown empires like the Limited and Abercrombie & Fitch, the city has seen a flurry of downtown development -- and gained an unexpected new profile as a Midwestern style capital. 
 The transformation has mostly taken place in the Short North district, a gallery-filled strip of North High Street that's home to the Wexner Center for the Arts (1871 N. High Street; 614-292-3535) and boutiques like Jinny (1) (844 N. High Street; 614-291-3600), where the former Los Angeles fashion editor Jin Fillinger stocks clothes from Sue Stemp, Harlow, Clu, Willow and Phillip Lim -- labels hard to find in the Midwest outside Chicago. 
 Four blocks away, the New York City expat Maren Roth recently opened Rowe (4) (718 N. High Street; 614-299-7693), a cool whitewashed space where she introduces shoppers to clothes by Generra, Lauren Moffatt, Bulga and Nieves Lavi. Customers often slip next door to the beauty boutique Luxe de Vie (720 N. High Street; 614-421-0589) for Bond no. 9 perfume, and around the corner to the street-wear shop TigerTree (2) (17 E. Brickel Street; 614-223-2136).
 A restaurant scene has also taken hold in the Short North. The new wine bar Marcella's (5) (615 N. High Street; 614-223-2100) is packed nightly; Northstar (6) (951 N. High Street; 614-298-9999) draws crowds for its organic menu; and Rosendales (3) (793 N. High Street; 614-298-1601) serves coffee-and-pepper-crusted steak with grated chocolate and parsnip silk. All this is a short drive from Tee Jaye's Country Place (4910 N. High Street; 614-885-1383), a Midwest stalwart where you can order anything on the menu covered in gravy.

HEADLINE: Lofts With Stories to Tell

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
JUDGING by the increasing numbers of lofts -- both conversions and new construction -- in cities like Yonkers and White Plains, it is clear that not everyone who moves to Westchester dreams of a four-bedroom colonial with a couple of baths and a tidy lawn.
 One of the newest such spaces to open is in New Rochelle, where developers have converted the 117-year-old weathered-brick Knickerbocker Press Building once owned by the publisher G. P. Putnam's Sons. It now houses 45 condos, ranging in size from 660 to 2,146 square feet, and in price from $370,000 to $705,000. 
 ''Buildings with history have stories to tell, and buyers go for that,'' said Susan Newman, a developer with Ginsburg Development Companies of Valhalla and Urban Green Builders of New York City, the partnership for the building. (Urban Green Builders specializes in urban redevelopment ventures and has renovated walk-ups and brownstones in Harlem; Ginsburg builds mostly luxury homes in the Hudson Valley and Connecticut, specializing in Hudson riverfront properties.) 
 The press building in New Rochelle, originally meant to hold the equipment used a century ago for printing books, has 14-foot-high ceilings and gouges in its floors.
 ''It's part of the charm of a loft,'' Ms. Newman said. ''The idea is to maintain that authentic feeling right down to the columns that are in awkward places and the rough floors, and to use as many parts of the building as possible.''
 Even a four-story watchtower above the main roofline has been used -- turned into a five-level residence with 360-degree views of the city, she said. 
 According to Ms. Newman, Putnam printed books in the building until about 1920, after which the American White Cross made bandages there until 1995. Concurrently, in the 1980s and '90s, artists used parts of the complex as work space. 
 In the county generally, Peekskill was ahead of the pack on lofts, creating its first in the late 1990s in conjunction with the county. The project, called ArtLOFT, was as its name suggests designed specifically for artists; its 27 work-live condominium units in five buildings were sold at below market prices.
 But since then, lofts elsewhere in Westchester have sought to appeal to a more general public. Along the former industrial waterfront in Yonkers, an old trolley storage building undergoing a conversion into rental units at the Lofts at Metro92 is drawing interest. A gut renovation was begun by the city and the Yonkers Downtown Waterfront Development Corporation and is being completed by MetroPartners, a Yonkers-based firm. 
 The 90,000-square-foot trolley barn, which forms a V shape at the corner of two downtown streets, now contains 40 units ranging from 1,100 to 1,500 square feet, with 20-foot ceilings and 10-foot windows. Rents range from $2,200 to $2,500 a month, and the building is almost fully leased, said Marijane Funess, a spokeswoman.
 One renter at the Loft at Metro92, Matthew Lombardo, a professional golfer, said he was smitten with the aesthetic of lofts along a waterfront. After living in California and returning to Westchester, Mr. Lombardo said, he craved something different. 
 Spurred by the popularity of Metro92, MetroPartners is planning to open a second residential building along the waterfront in the fall. Called 66Main, it is a new building with loftlike studio, one- and two-bedroom units renting for $1,400 to $2,800, said Ms. Funess, the spokeswoman.
 An earlier Yonkers project, Broadway Lofts, in a 110-year-old former stone and brick garment factory, proved attractive to young singles from Manhattan and the Bronx, said Kathleen S. Murray, vice president for project marketing at Houlihan Lawrence. Its 15 condos -- some with their original pressed-tin ceilings and worn wooden floors -- sold out within a year, said the developer, Peter Murray (no relation to Ms. Murray). Prices ranged from $255,000, for 872 square feet, to $330,000, for 1,294 square feet.
 In White Plains two years ago, in a hotter real estate market, Louis R. Cappelli built 28 SoHo-style loft condos with lofty prices to match: $530,000 to $1.28 million. His hunch was on the mark; he sold them out in six months, said Marge Schneider, a Cappelli executive vice president. 
 Some buyers at Mr. Cappelli's project, called Lofts at City Center in White Plains, combined units ranging in size from 900 to 1,920 square feet, Ms. Schneider said. 
 ''Lofts imply a funky kind of living,'' she added. ''Buyers love the dramatic floor-to-ceiling windows and the open floor plans, and the freedom from convention all of that suggests.''
 Now the company, like Ginsburg, is testing the waters in New Rochelle: the Lofts at New Roc, a 98-unit conversion of a former rental building where studios, one- and two-bedrooms are selling for about $350,000 to $700,000. Since the units went on the market in June 2006, about half have sold, primarily to young first-time buyers, Ms. Schneider said.
 A loft conversion five years ago in New Rochelle -- in a 100,000-square-foot former Bloomingdale's branch that had been empty for 25 years -- was a success for 554-560 Main Street Associates. Called Lofts on Main, it offered 72 condominium lofts with 13- to 15-foot ceilings, oversize windows and interior spaces of 900 to 1,800 square feet. Prices ranged from $185,000 to $400,000, and sales were brisk.
 The market today may not quite be that brisk. But at the Knickerbocker Press Building, Ms. Newman reported that since the sales office opened a week ago, she has been fielding inquiries from a variety of buyers. One woman, an empty-nester in Scarsdale, said she was looking to trade in her colonial and move back into a loft like the one she and her husband started out in many years ago on Mercer Street in Manhattan. 
 ''The woman told me that lofts, at least for her, were associated with happy memories,'' Ms. Newman said.

HEADLINE: At Many Homes, More Profit and Less Nursing

BYLINE: By CHARLES DUHIGG

 BODY:
Habana Health Care Center, a 150-bed nursing home in Tampa, Fla., was struggling when a group of large private investment firms purchased it and 48 other nursing homes in 2002.
 The facility's managers quickly cut costs. Within months, the number of clinical registered nurses at the home was half what it had been a year earlier, records collected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services indicate. Budgets for nursing supplies, resident activities and other services also fell, according to Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration. 
 The investors and operators were soon earning millions of dollars a year from their 49 homes. 
 Residents fared less well. Over three years, 15 at Habana died from what their families contend was negligent care in lawsuits filed in state court. Regulators repeatedly warned the home that staff levels were below mandatory minimums. When regulators visited, they found malfunctioning fire doors, unhygienic kitchens and a resident using a leg brace that was broken. 
 ''They've created a hellhole,'' said Vivian Hewitt, who sued Habana in 2004 when her mother died after a large bedsore became infected by feces. 
 Habana is one of thousands of nursing homes across the nation that large Wall Street investment companies have bought or agreed to acquire in recent years.
 Those investors include prominent private equity firms like Warburg Pincus and the Carlyle Group, better known for buying companies like Dunkin' Donuts. 
 As such investors have acquired nursing homes, they have often reduced costs, increased profits and quickly resold facilities for significant gains. 
 But by many regulatory benchmarks, residents at those nursing homes are worse off, on average, than they were under previous owners, according to an analysis by The New York Times of data collected by government agencies from 2000 to 2006. 
 The Times analysis shows that, as at Habana, managers at many other nursing homes acquired by large private investors have cut expenses and staff, sometimes below minimum legal requirements. 
 Regulators say residents at these homes have suffered. At facilities owned by private investment firms, residents on average have fared more poorly than occupants of other homes in common problems like depression, loss of mobility and loss of ability to dress and bathe themselves, according to data collected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
 The typical nursing home acquired by a large investment company before 2006 scored worse than national rates in 12 of 14 indicators that regulators use to track ailments of long-term residents. Those ailments include bedsores and easily preventable infections, as well as the need to be restrained. Before they were acquired by private investors, many of those homes scored at or above national averages in similar measurements.
 In the past, residents' families often responded to such declines in care by suing, and regulators levied heavy fines against nursing home chains where understaffing led to lapses in care.
 But private investment companies have made it very difficult for plaintiffs to succeed in court and for regulators to levy chainwide fines by creating complex corporate structures that obscure who controls their nursing homes. 
 By contrast, publicly owned nursing home chains are essentially required to disclose who controls their facilities in securities filings and other regulatory documents. 
 The Byzantine structures established at homes owned by private investment firms also make it harder for regulators to know if one company is responsible for multiple centers. And the structures help managers bypass rules that require them to report when they, in effect, pay themselves from programs like Medicare and Medicaid. 
 Investors in these homes say such structures are common in other businesses and have helped them revive an industry that was on the brink of widespread bankruptcy. 
 ''Lawyers were convincing nursing home residents to sue over almost anything,'' said Arnold M. Whitman, a principal with the fund that bought Habana in 2002, Formation Properties I. 
 Homes were closing because of ballooning litigation costs, he said. So investors like Mr. Whitman created corporate structures that insulated them from costly lawsuits, according to his company.
 ''We should be recognized for supporting this industry when almost everyone else was running away,'' Mr. Whitman said in an interview. 
 Some families of residents say those structures unjustly protect investors who profit while care declines.
 When Mrs. Hewitt sued Habana over her mother's death, for example, she found that its owners and managers had spread control of Habana among 15 companies and five layers of firms. 
 As a result, Mrs. Hewitt's lawyer, like many others confronting privately owned homes, has been unable to establish definitively who was responsible for her mother's care. 
 Current staff members at Habana declined to comment. Formation Properties I said it owned only Habana's real estate and leased it to an independent company, and thus bore no responsibility for resident care. 
 That independent company -- Florida Health Care Properties, which eventually became Epsilon Health Care Properties and subleased the home's operation to Tampa Health Care Associates -- is affiliated with Warburg Pincus, one of the world's largest private equity firms. Warburg Pincus, Florida Health Care, Epsilon and Tampa Health Care all declined to comment.
 Demand for Nursing Homes
 The graying of America has presented financial opportunities for all kinds of businesses. Nursing homes, which received more than $75 billion last year from taxpayer programs like Medicare and Medicaid, offer some of the biggest rewards.
 ''There's essentially unlimited consumer demand as the baby boomers age,'' said Ronald E. Silva, president and chief executive of Fillmore Capital Partners, which paid $1.8 billion last year to buy one of the nation's largest nursing home chains. ''I've never seen a surer bet.'' 
 For years, investors shunned nursing home companies as the industry was battered by bankruptcies, expensive lawsuits and regulatory investigations. 
 But in recent years, large private investment groups have agreed to buy 6 of the nation's 10 largest nursing home chains, containing over 141,000 beds, or 9 percent of the nation's total. Private investment groups own at least another 60,000 beds at smaller chains and are expected to acquire many more companies as firms come under shareholder pressure to sell. 
 The typical large chain owned by an investment company in 2005 earned $1,700 a resident, according to reports filed by the facilities. Those homes, on average, were 41 percent more profitable than the average facility. 
 But, as in the case of Habana, cutting costs has become an issue at homes owned by large investment groups. 
 ''The first thing owners do is lay off nurses and other staff that are essential to keeping patients safe,'' said Charlene Harrington, a professor at the University of California in San Francisco who studies nursing homes. In her opinion, she added, ''chains have made a lot of money by cutting nurses, but it's at the cost of human lives.''
 The Times's analysis of records collected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reveals that at 60 percent of homes bought by large private equity groups from 2000 to 2006, managers have cut the number of clinical registered nurses, sometimes far below levels required by law. (At 19 percent of those homes, staffing has remained relatively constant, though often below national averages. At 21 percent, staffing rose significantly, though even those homes were typically below national averages.) During that period, staffing at many of the nation's other homes has fallen much less or grown.
 Nurses are often residents' primary medical providers. In 2002, the Department of Health and Human Services said most nursing home residents needed at least 1.3 hours of care a day from a registered or licensed practical nurse. The average home was close to meeting that standard last year, according to data. 
 But homes owned by large investment companies typically provided only one hour of care a day, according to The Times's analysis of records collected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
 For the most highly trained nurses, staffing was particularly low: Homes owned by large private investment firms provided one clinical registered nurse for every 20 residents, 35 percent below the national average, the analysis showed. 
 Regulators with state and federal health care agencies have cited those staffing deficiencies alongside some cases where residents died from accidental suffocations, injuries or other medical emergencies.
 Federal and state regulators also said in interviews that such cuts help explain why serious quality-of-care deficiencies -- like moldy food and the restraining of residents for long periods or the administration of wrong medications -- rose at every large nursing home chain after it was acquired by a private investment group from 2000 to 2006, even as citations declined at many other homes and chains. 
 The typical number of serious health deficiencies cited by regulators last year was almost 19 percent higher at homes owned by large investment companies than the national average, according to analysis of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services records.
 (The Times's analysis of trends did not include Genesis HealthCare, which was acquired earlier this year, or HCR Manor Care, which the Carlyle Group is buying, because sufficient data were not available.) 
 Representatives of all the investment groups that bought nursing home chains since 2000 -- Warburg Pincus, Formation, National Senior Care, Fillmore Capital Partners and the Carlyle Group -- were offered the data and findings from the Times analysis. All but one declined to comment. 
 An executive with a company owned by Fillmore Capital, which acquired 342 homes last year, said that because some data regarding the company were missing or collected before its acquisition, The Times's analysis was not a complete portrayal of current conditions. That executive, Jack MacDonald, also said that it was too early to evaluate the new management, that the staff numbers at homes over all was rising and that quality had improved by some measures. 
 ''We are focused on becoming a better organization today than we were 18 months ago,'' he said. ''We are confident that we will be an even better organization in the future.''
 A Web of Responsibility
 Vivian Hewitt's mother, Alice Garcia, was 81 and suffering from Alzheimer's disease when, in late 2002, she moved into Habana.
 ''I couldn't take care of her properly anymore, and Habana seemed like a really nice place,'' Mrs. Hewitt said. 
 Earlier that year, Formation bought Habana, 48 other nursing homes and four assisted living centers from Beverly Enterprises, one of the nation's largest chains, for $165 million. 
 Formation immediately leased many of the homes, including Habana, to an affiliate of Warburg Pincus. That firm spread management of the homes among dozens of other corporations, according to documents filed with Florida agencies and depositions from lawsuits.
 Each home was operated by a separate company. Other companies helped choose staff, keep the books and negotiate for equipment and supplies. Some companies had no employees or offices, which let executives file regulatory documents without revealing their other corporate affiliations. 
 Habana's managers increased occupancy, and cut expenses by laying off about 10 of 30 clinical administrators and nurses, Medicare filings reveal. (After regulators complained, some positions were refilled and other spending increased.) Soon, Medicare regulators cited Habana for malfunctioning fire doors and moldy air vents.
 Throughout that period, Formation and the Warburg Pincus affiliate received rent and fees that were directly tied to Habana's revenues, interviews and regulatory filings show. As the home's fiscal health improved, those payments grew. In total, they exceeded $3.5 million by last year. The companies also profited from the other 48 homes. 
 Though spending cuts improved the home's bottom line, they raised concerns among regulators and staff.
 ''Those owners wouldn't let us hire people,'' said Annie Thornton, who became interim director of nursing around the time Habana was acquired, and who left about a year later. ''We told the higher-ups we needed more staffing, but they said we should make do.''
 Regulators typically visit nursing homes about once a year. But in the 12 months after Formation's acquisition of Habana, they visited an average of once a month, often in response to residents' complaints. The home was cited for failing to follow doctors' orders, cutting staff below legal minimums, blocking emergency exits, storing food in unhygienic areas and other health violations. 
 Soon after, nursing home inspectors wrote in Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services documents that Habana was at fault when a resident suffocated because his tracheotomy tube became clogged. Although he had complained of shortness of breath, there were no records showing that staff had checked on him for almost two days.
 Those citations never mentioned Formation, Warburg Pincus or its affiliates. Warburg Pincus and its affiliates declined to discuss the citations. Formation said it was merely a landlord.
 ''Formation Properties owns real estate and leases it to an unaffiliated third party that obtains a license to operate it as a health care facility,'' Formation said. ''No citation would mention Formation Properties since it has no involvement or control over the operations at the facility or any entity that is involved in such operations.''
 For Mrs. Hewitt's mother, problems began within months of moving in as she suffered repeated falls. 
 ''I would call and call and call them to come to her room to change her diaper or help me move her, but they would never come,'' Mrs. Hewitt recalled. 
 Five months later, Mrs. Hewitt discovered that her mother had a large bedsore on her back that was oozing pus. Mrs. Garcia was rushed to the hospital. A physician later said the wound should have been detected much earlier, according to medical records submitted as part of a lawsuit Mrs. Hewitt filed in a Florida Circuit Court.
 Three weeks later, Mrs. Garcia died. 
 ''I feel so guilty,'' Mrs. Hewitt said. ''But there was no way for me to find out how bad that place really was.''
 Death and a Lawsuit
 Within a few months, Mrs. Hewitt decided to sue the nursing home.
 ''The only way I can send a message is to hit them in their pocketbook, to make it too expensive to let people like my mother suffer,'' she said.
 But when Mrs. Hewitt's lawyer, Sumeet Kaul, began investigating Habana's corporate structure, he discovered that its complexity meant that even if she prevailed in court, the investors' wallets would likely be out of reach.
 Others had tried and failed. In response to dozens of lawsuits, Formation and affiliates of Warburg Pincus had successfully argued in court that they were not nursing home operators, and thus not liable for deficiencies in care. 
 Formation said in a statement that it was not reasonable to hold the company responsible for residents, ''any more, say, than it would be reasonable for a landlord who owns a building, one of whose tenants is Starbucks, to be held liable if a Starbucks customer is scalded by a cup of hot coffee.'' 
 Formation, Warburg Pincus and its affiliates all declined to answer questions regarding Mrs. Hewitt's lawsuit. 
 Advocates for nursing home reforms say anyone who profits from a facility should be held accountable for its care. 
 ''Private equity is buying up this industry and then hiding the assets,'' said Toby S. Edelman, a nursing home expert with the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit group that counsels people on Medicare. ''And now residents are dying, and there is little the courts or regulators can do.''
 Mrs. Hewitt's lawyer has spent three years and $30,000 trying to prove that an affiliate of Warburg Pincus might be responsible for Mrs. Garcia's care. He has not named Formation or Warburg Pincus as defendants. A judge is expected to rule on some of his arguments this year. 
 Complex corporate structures have dissuaded scores of other lawyers from suing nursing homes.
 About 70 percent of lawyers who once sued homes have stopped because the cases became too expensive or difficult, estimates Nathan P. Carter, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Florida. 
 ''In one case, I had to sue 22 different companies,'' he said. ''In another, I got a $400,000 verdict and ended up collecting only $25,000.'' 
 Regulators have also been stymied.
 For instance, Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration has named Habana and 34 other homes owned by Formation and operated by affiliates of Warburg Pincus as among the state's worst in categories like ''nutrition and hydration,'' ''restraints and abuse'' and ''quality of care.'' Those homes have been individually cited for violations of safety codes, but there have been no chainwide investigations or fines, because regulators were unaware that all the facilities were owned and operated by a common group, said Molly McKinstry, bureau chief for long-term-care services at Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration.
 And even when regulators do issue fines to investor-owned homes, they have found penalties difficult to collect.
 ''These companies leave the nursing home licensee with no assets, and so there is nothing to take,'' said Scott Johnson, special assistant attorney general of Mississippi.
 Government authorities are also frequently unaware when nursing homes pay large fees to affiliates. 
 For example, Habana, operated by a Warburg Pincus affiliate, paid other Warburg Pincus affiliates an estimated $558,000 for management advice and other services last year, according to reports the home filed. 
 Government programs require nursing homes to reveal when they pay affiliates so that such disbursements can be scrutinized to make sure they are not artificially inflated.
 However, complex corporate structures make such scrutiny difficult. Regulators did not know that so many of Habana's payments went to companies affiliated with Warburg Pincus.
 ''The government tries to make sure homes are paying a fair market value for things like rent and consulting and supplies,'' said John Villegas-Grubbs, a Medicaid expert who has developed payment systems for several states. ''But when home owners pay themselves without revealing it, they can pad their bills. It's not feasible to expect regulators to catch that unless they have transparency on ownership structures.''
 Formation and Warburg Pincus both declined to discuss disclosure issues.
 Groups lobbying to increase transparency at nursing homes say complicated corporate structures should be outlawed. One idea popular among organizations like the National Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform is requiring the company that owns a home's most valuable assets, its land and building, to manage it. That would put owners at risk if care declines. 
 But owners say that tying a home's property to its operation would make it impossible to operate in leased facilities, and exacerbate a growing nationwide nursing home shortage. 
 Moreover, investors say, they deserve credit for rebuilding an industry on the edge of widespread insolvency. 
 ''Legal and regulatory costs were killing this industry,'' said Mr. Whitman, the Formation executive. 
 For instance, Beverly Enterprises, which also had a history of regulatory problems, sold Habana and the rest of its Florida centers to Formation because, it said at the time, of rising litigation costs. AON Risk Consultants, a research company, says the average cost of nursing home litigation in Florida during that period had increased 270 percent in five years. 
 ''Lawyers were suing nursing homes because they knew the companies were worth billions of dollars, so we made the companies smaller and poorer, and the lawsuits have diminished,'' Mr. Whitman said. This year, another fund affiliated with Mr. Whitman and other investors acquired the nation's third-largest nursing home chain, Genesis HealthCare, for $1.5 billion. 
 If investors are barred from setting up complex structures, ''this industry makes no economic sense,'' Mr. Whitman said. ''If nursing home owners are forced to operate at a loss, the entire industry will disappear.'' 
 However, advocates for nursing home reforms say investors exaggerate the industry's precariousness. Last year, Formation sold Habana and 185 other facilities to General Electric for $1.4 billion. A prominent nursing home industry analyst, Steve Monroe, estimates that Formation's and its co-investors' gains from that sale were more than $500 million in just four years. Formation declined to comment on that figure.
 Analyzing the Data
 For this article, The New York Times analyzed trends at nursing homes purchased by private investment groups by examining data available from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. 
 The Times examined more than 1,200 nursing homes purchased by large private investment groups since 2000, and more than 14,000 other homes. The analysis compared investor-owned homes against national averages in multiple categories, including complaints received by regulators, health and safety violations cited by regulators, fines levied by state and federal authorities, the performance of homes as reported in a national database known as the Minimum Data Set Repository and the performance of homes as reported in the Online Survey, Certification and Reporting database.

HEADLINE: U.N. Chief Urges More Help From Iraq's Neighbors

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE; Jason Grant contributed reporting.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 22 

 BODY:
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Saturday urged Middle Eastern countries to curb the activities of people within their borders who undermine Iraq and to help Iraq's government achieve national reconciliation.
 With Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, the Iraqi prime minister, by his side at a meeting here of foreign ministers from 20 nations, Mr. Ban said, ''There is a close relationship between Iraqi national dialogue and regional cooperation.''
 ''For the stability of Iraq,'' he said ''regional countries have an important role in securing their borders, confronting those who work to destabilize Iraq from within their territories, promoting religious and ethnic tolerance and developing healthy economic exchange.'' 
 He issued his call during opening remarks in the closed meeting, according to a transcript furnished by his office.
 The meeting was called by Mr. Ban to seek ways to turn the United Nations' expanded presence in Iraq into increased international support for stabilizing the country.
 Among the countries attending were the five permanent members of the Security Council and eight neighbors of Iraq, including Iran and Syria. The United States was represented by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
 The Security Council last month approved broadening the organization's mandate in Iraq beyond assisting aid groups and providing help with elections and the constitution to include aiding national reconciliation and facilitating regional talks. The Security Council acted after repeated American requests for more United Nations involvement. 
 ''The United Nations maintains several distinct comparative advantages in Iraq,'' Mr. Ban said. ''It enjoys good relations with a wide range of actors from across the political spectrum.''
 He told the foreign ministers that the United Nations intended to increase its staff in the northern city of Erbil and to create a new office in Basra, in the south.
 The meeting also served as a test on the international stage for Mr. Maliki, who has inspired limited trust with countries in the region and whose leadership has been questioned by Washington.
 But at a news conference after the meeting, Mr. Maliki said the participants had all expressed support for his government, and he said he had assured them that Iraq was gaining stability.
 ''I said that the security situation has improved, the economic situation has also improved,'' he said. ''As a result, thousands of families who left their homes have decided to return to the country and this, thanks to the assistance of the Iraqi government.''
 He said Iraq should be backed by other countries because it was trying to end a religious war in their behalf. ''Of course there are still pockets of terrorist militias who are working in the shadows,'' he added, ''but they all are pursued by Iraqi forces.''
 Speaking at a press briefing at a Manhattan hotel after the meeting, which was also attended by delegations from Iran and Syria, David M. Satterfield, the secretary's coordinator for Iraq, said Mr. Maliki indicated that there ''is still much work to do -- but the corner has been turned.''
 He said participants discussed ''the significance of the refugee issue.'' He said Syria and Jordan expressed concern over ''the sacrifices they were making for the sake of Iraqi refugees.'' 
 In turn, said Mr. Satterfield, ''Prime Minister Maliki acknowledged this is first and foremost an Iraqi responsibility.'' 
 United Nations officials expressed concern in helping the estimated two million Iraqis who have fled Iraq. Most have settled in Jordan and Syria, and Mr. Ban warned that the two countries' ''capacities were strained to extreme levels.''
 The United Nations has had a diminished presence in Baghdad since the August 2003 bombing of its headquarters there that killed 22 people, including the mission chief, Sergio Vieira de Mello. That presence will be expanded now to fit the new mandate.

HEADLINE: The Mayor and Spending

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Mayor Preaches Frugality but Uses Windfall'' (front page, Sept. 17): 
 Your Jan. 14 editorial had it right when it said, ''Mr. Bloomberg has rightly ended the myopia of budgets past, extending forward planning to four years, controlling spending where he could and lobbying the state where he could not.''
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg brought New York City back from a fiscal crisis by making tough, sometimes unpopular decisions -- and by carefully managing the bottom line. 
 He's made high-return investments that have improved our quality of life and enhanced our competitiveness. And far from allowing agency spending sprees, he's rolled forward billions to pay future debt and health care costs -- something few others can claim. 
 The numbers are clear. Most growth in spending has been driven by pensions, Medicaid and other noncontrollable expenses, while agency spending is just slightly higher than inflation. 
 Quality-of-life indicators are going in the right direction. Property values are up. Commercial vacancies are down. And creditors today give the city its highest bond ratings ever.

HEADLINE: A Resilient Leader Trumpets Brazil's Potential in Agriculture and Biofuels

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
In recent months the political climate in Brazil has been a boiling caldron for Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the country's president.
 The second deadly airplane crash in 10 months set off a crisis in Brazil's aviation industry in July, with many critics saying government inaction was at the root of the problem.
 Last month, the country's Supreme Court ordered 40 members of the president's political party to stand trial on corruption charges in a scandal that has netted some of his closest advisers, including his former chief of staff. 
 But as Mr. da Silva, now in his second term, sat down for a 75-minute interview here in the presidential palace, those worries hardly seemed to faze him. He was nothing but upbeat, and with good reason. 
 Despite the controversies, Mr. da Silva's approval rating hovers above 60 percent. Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, has grown by 3.5 percent a year, slower than China and India but a marked improvement over the 1990s. Debt levels and unemployment are down. Reserves are up. Inflation is one-third what it was five years ago. 
 ''We are experiencing an auspicious moment in Brazil right now,'' Mr. da Silva, 61, said in his first extended discussion with an American journalist since 2004. ''Brazil is experiencing its best economic period.''
 That boom combined with his broad popularity among Brazil's working class has provided Mr. da Silva, a former metal worker with a sixth-grade education who worked in an auto plant, with remarkable political resilience. 
 ''He is the Teflon president,'' said David Fleischer, a political analyst here and an emeritus professor at the University of Brasilia. ''Nothing sticks to Lula.''
 That includes the scandals that by now could have debilitated another presidency. But Mr. da Silva continued to deny knowing anything about the most recent one, in which members of the governing party are accused of paying congressional deputies more than $10,000 a month to vote for favored legislation.
 He refused to say if anyone in particular had betrayed him. ''There are hundreds of employees around me that I don't have any idea what they are doing,'' Mr. da Silva said. 
 One of them, apparently, was his former chief of staff, Jose Dirceu, whom many consider the architect of Mr. da Silva's rise to power, and who has been charged with being the mastermind of the vote-buying scheme.
 ''I don't believe that there is any evidence that Mr. Dirceu committed the crime that he is being charged with,'' the president said. ''He will be judged.''
 Fresh from a trip to Europe, where he stirred interest in Brazil's sugar-based ethanol fuel and won billions of dollars in investment pledges, Mr. da Silva was instead focused on the economy. 
 Exports of Brazil's raw commodities like soybeans and iron ore are booming as a result of high global prices and insatiable demand from Asia. In one sign of Brazil's economic health, as the subprime credit crisis was roiling the United States a few weeks ago, Brazil's bonds were raised to just below investment grade.
 He said that Latin America as a whole was at a critical moment, when it needed to seize the opportunity to shore up its economies, notorious for mismanagement and corruption. 
 At the same time, he shrugged off suggestions that he should seek to be a hemispheric force and a stronger counterweight to President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, who has aggressively seized the spotlight in the region with his energy deal-making and political maneuvering in favor of left-wing candidates.
 ''We in Latin America are not trying to look for a leader,'' Mr. da Silva said. ''We don't need a leader. What we need to do is build political harmony because South America and Latin America need to learn the lesson of the 20th century. We had the opportunity to grow, we had the opportunity to develop ourselves, and we lost that opportunity. So we still continue to be poor countries. 
 ''What I want is to govern my country well.''
 As Mr. da Silva heads to New York on Sunday for a United Nations meeting, he is relentlessly pitching Brazil's agricultural potential and energy experience, especially in ethanol, which Brazil makes from sugar cane, a source more efficient than corn. 
 With ample arable land that is the envy of the world, and a 20-year head start on developing a biofuels industry, Brazil is the only country exporting ethanol in any significant quantities.
 Mr. da Silva predicted that within 15 years a global biofuels industry would be developed, with the commodity being shipped around the world on tankers for a global price. 
 ''I believe that the world will yield to biofuels,'' he said. 
 He found a receptive audience recently in Sweden, where he rode in an all-ethanol-powered bus in Stockholm, one of 600 buses, he said, that the Swedish government had retrofitted for use with biofuels. Sweden wants every new car on the road to run on renewable fuels by 2020. The European Union has recommended its countries add 5.7 percent ethanol to the gasoline supply by 2010.
 ''We will democratize energy access,'' he said. ''Instead of 10 countries producing oil, we could have 120 countries producing biofuels.''
 So far, however, a biofuels accord Mr. da Silva signed with President Bush this year has yet to yield concrete results. The two countries agreed to share technology and experience to develop technical standards. 
 An import tariff in the United States, supported by the powerful farm lobby, has prevented Brazil from competing for a share of the American market with corn-based ethanol. 
 Relations are generally warm with the United States. But Brazil's relations with Venezuela have been strained at times with Mr. Chavez as Brazil has appeared to shy away from some of Mr. Chavez's proposals for greater regional integration. 
 In the interview, however, Mr. da Silva offered tacit support for the creation of a ''Bank of the South,'' which could provide more money for development.
 He also said that more than 50 experts from Petrobras, Brazil's state oil company, and officials from Petroleos de Venezuela were still discussing a $15 billion natural gas pipeline project that would stretch 5,000 miles from Venezuela to Argentina. 
 A crucial question is whether enough gas exists to make it viable, Mr. da Silva said. Mr. Chavez on Thursday again blamed Petrobras for delays in approving the project, Reuters reported.
 The economic focus was consistent with Mr. da Silva's move to the center since he took office in January 2003. 
 Since then he extended many of the economic policies of his predecessor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, while putting in place programs like Family Allowance, a welfare program devised to help the poor. Last year, the program offered monthly subsidies of about $50 to some 11 million families, representing 40 million to 50 million voters.
 Mr. da Silva's personal story has inspired millions of Brazilians: he grew up dirt poor in a small town and later worked as a lathe operator at an auto plant. He found his calling as a labor leader and politician. 
 Despite his modest education and sometimes questionable grammar, his personal warmth and colorful references to Brazilian soccer have captivated many.
 When he steps down in 2010, Mr. da Silva said, he plans to head back home to Sao Bernardo do Campo, the hardscrabble industrial town near Sao Paulo where he got his start in politics with the metal workers' union. 
 ''I am not going to go on a graduate study program at Harvard University,'' he said, in a dig at his predecessor, Mr. Cardoso, who regularly teaches at Brown.
 ''When I leave the presidency,'' he said, ''the one thing I want in life is to be treated as a friend by all of those who were my friends before I took office.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, referred incorrectly to the affiliations of 40 people ordered to stand trial recently on corruption charges, part of a scandal that has included some of his closest advisers. Seven -- not all 40 -- are members of his Workers Party. (The other 33 included eight members from allied parties, 14 staff members in the Chamber of Deputies, seven people from advertising agencies and four bank employees.)

HEADLINE: Alaska Seeks Alternative to Bridge Plan

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: JUNEAU, Alaska, Sept. 22 

 BODY:
Some called it a bridge to the future. Others called it the bridge to nowhere.
 On Friday, Alaska decided the bridge really was going nowhere, officially abandoning the project in Ketchikan that became a national symbol of federal pork barrel spending.
 While the move closes a chapter that has brought the state endless ridicule, it also leaves open wounds in a community that fought for decades to get federal help. 
 ''We went through political hot water, tons of it, and not just nationally but internationally,'' said Mayor Joe Williams of Ketchikan Gateway Borough. ''We have nothing to show for it.''
 The $398 million bridge would have connected Ketchikan, on one island in southeastern Alaska, to its airport on a nearby island.
 Gov. Sarah Palin, a Republican, said Friday that the project was $329 million short.
 ''We will continue to look for options for Ketchikan to allow better access to the island,'' Ms. Palin said. ''The concentration is not going to be on a $400 million bridge.''
 Ms. Palin said the best alternative for access to the airport would be to upgrade the ferry system.
 Ketchikan is Alaska's entry port for northbound cruise ships that bring more than one million visitors yearly. Every flight into Gravina Island requires a 15-minute ferry ride to reach the more densely populated Revillagigedo Island.
 The town, seven blocks wide and eight miles long, has little room to grow. Local officials have said access to Gravina Island, population 50, is needed for the town and its economy to grow.
 They called the state's decision premature, saying it came without warning.
 ''For somebody who touts process and transparency in getting projects done, I'm disappointed and taken aback,'' said State Representative Kyle Johansen, Republican of Ketchikan. ''We worked 30 years to get funding for this priority project.''
 Senator Ted Stevens and Representative Don Young, both Republicans, championed the project through Congress two years ago, securing more than $200 million for the bridge between Revillagigedo and Gravina Islands.
 Under mounting political pressure over pork projects, Congress stripped the earmark, or stipulation, that the money be used for the airport, but still sent the money to the state for any use it deemed appropriate.
 A spokesman for Mr. Stevens, Aaron Saunders, said Friday that the senator was interested in how the state ultimately used the money. A spokeswoman for Mr. Young said the congressman would have no comment.
 Just last month, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is seeking his party's presidential nomination, said pet projects could have played a role in a Minnesotabridge collapse that killed 13 people earlier this year.
 ''Maybe if we had done it right,'' Mr. McCain said at a forum in Ankeny, Iowa, ''maybe some of that money would have gone to inspect those bridges and other bridges around the country. Maybe the 200,000 people who cross that bridge every day would have been safer than spending $233 million of your tax dollars on a bridge in Alaska to an island with 50 people on it.''
 On Friday, Leo von Scheben, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Transportation, said the bridge money could be used to build roads in Alaska.
 ''There is no question we desperately need to construct new roads in this state,'' Mr. von Scheben said in a statement, ''including in southeast Alaska, where skyrocketing costs for the Alaska Marine Highway System present an impediment to the state's budget and the region's economy.'' 
 The governor urged Alaskans not to dwell on the bridge.
 ''Much of the public's attitude toward Alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here,'' Ms. Palin said. ''But we need to focus on what we can do, rather than fight over what has happened.''

HEADLINE: Frustrated New Yorkers Grapple With Loan Rates

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
A MONTH after the mortgage markets started to crumble, mortgage brokers and lawyers say that New Yorkers are finding it harder than ever to get mortgages and are increasingly backing out of deals. This lending slowdown has seemed to affect a broader segment of New York City apartment hunters, many of whom are now waiting to see if prices drop because of the mortgage crisis before they commit to buying. 
 Buyers affected by these changes include younger New Yorkers with short credit histories and, interestingly, professionals who buy apartments with small down payments and nearly 100 percent financing and count on end-of-year bonuses to pay down the loans.
 The market has reached the point that mortgage brokers like Lori Famighetti, chief executive of Oxford Wellington Mortgage Company, are telling their clients in New York not even to try to get a mortgage for more than $1 million at a competitive interest rate if they have a credit score of less than 680 and want a loan of 90 percent or more of the purchase price. 
 ''This is the market now,'' Ms. Famighetti said. ''The buyer has to have a 700 or 720 credit score'' to be considered for a mortgage that would cover more than 90 percent of the sales price. 
 While some New Yorkers will still talk about the exceptional mortgages that they got at rates better than those of a few months ago, these deals tend to be exceptions available to borrowers requiring smaller loans or with high credit scores. Whether this week's rate cut actually affects rates or improves buyers' moods remains to be seen.
 Richard Barenblatt, a mortgage broker with the Apple Mortgage Corporation, helped one client, Freda Gimpel, pay out less monthly than she had originally expected. But he stressed that the bargain occurred because she financed the deal with a conforming mortgage, a loan that falls under guidelines set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The ceiling on these loans is now set at $417,000, and the rates they carry overall have been dropping. Larger loans are considered jumbo or super-jumbo in industry parlance.
 Mr. Barenblatt pointed out that many buyers need to borrow far more than $417,000 -- especially in Manhattan, where the average price for an apartment in June was $1.3 million.
 ''She came out ahead,'' Mr. Barenblatt said of Ms. Gimpel. ''But it's rare.''
 Brokers warn that some of the most adversely affected buyers will be those seeking to borrow a lot of money for new condominiums that cost $1 million to $2 million, without having been able to lock in rates on loans.
 Jeffrey Appel, director of new development financing at the Preferred Empire Mortgage Company, says he has seen buyers who have already made down payments on apartments this expensive, who are now having trouble setting mortgage rates. As he explained it, these buyers originally thought that they could borrow nearly the entire amount of the purchase, but now many banks won't lend them as much, and they will have to come up with the difference.
 ''I'm concerned about the folks who have been approved at the 90 or 95 percent level where the products or programs may change before they close,'' Mr. Appel said.
 Many people hoping to buy new apartments are finding that, months before their closing dates, they cannot lock in rates. Buyers who do not qualify for the mortgages they need by the time they close also risk losing their down payments, because contracts for them tend to be ironclad. Last August, Hannah Taylor-Noren, 23, found a $495,000 one-bedroom in the Ikon, a building under construction at 50 Bayard Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with help from her agent, Lee Oelkers.
 She estimated that she could manage a monthly payment of about $3,200, including maintenance and without factoring in income tax savings based on homeownership. She hired a lawyer, got preapproved for a mortgage and had her bank draft a $78,000 check from her account for the down payment.
 But then Ms. Taylor-Noren, an event planner, watched the mortgage market unravel. No bank would guarantee that she would still qualify for a mortgage six months into the future without hefty fees, a problem since she wouldn't be closing on the apartment until spring. 
 Ms. Taylor-Noren knew she would not be able to afford higher payments if mortgage rates rose before she closed, and did not want to put down a nonrefundable deposit if there were any chance she might lose it. 
 ''It was a great price and perfect for my budget,'' she said. ''I couldn't lock in a rate. It was terrible.'' On Aug. 14, Ms. Taylor-Noren backed out of the deal. 
 Adam Leitman Bailey, the head of a real estate law firm, said that in the last three weeks, five buyers represented by his firm had backed out of deals for apartments -- ranging from $595,000 to $4.5 million -- in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
 He said that several of them were financing their apartments partly with Wall Street bonuses, and that they had pulled out because their lenders folded, could not deliver financing right before closing or could not promise to lock in a rate because the apartments were in projects under construction. He said that while some of his clients could have found mortgages, they were concerned about what might happen to the real estate market, Wall Street and the broader economy.
 ''It's not only the financing,'' Mr. Bailey said. ''It's the fear. They fear that prices are going to go down or we're going to have a recession.''
 Other buyers have backed out of deals because they can't afford their higher mortgage payments and they think prices may drop later this year. 
 In June, Sam Payrovi, Elliot Chun and Michael Grossman -- friends who met as students at the University of California at Los Angeles -- decided to buy a $1.65 million bachelor pad at 123 Baxter Street, in Little Italy. They looked at 30 apartments and, when they found the place on Baxter Street, hired a lawyer to help them structure the purchase as a partnership and an architect to help with minor renovation plans.
 They had a commitment from a mortgage broker for a loan with payments of about $3,500 a month each before tax deductions. All their agent, James Coleman of Bond New York, had to do was hammer out the final contract details.
 But negotiations dragged out, as the three friends tried to work with the developer on contract language allowing them to convert the two-bedroom apartment into a three-bedroom. By September, they realized that with mortgage rates rising, their monthly payments had jumped to $3,800 each. 
 On Sept. 12, they backed out of the deal before a contract was signed. Mr. Payrovi said that they lost nearly $3,000 in legal and architectural fees, but that they could not afford the $300 monthly difference and feared prices would drop after they closed. 
 Not everyone, of course, has a bad mortgage story to tell. In early July, Ms. Gimpel put down about $150,000 to buy a $600,000 one-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side. She had a commitment letter for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, but not a rate lock, from GreenPoint Mortgage, a division of Capital One Financial Corporation, at a rate that would have translated into a $2,950 monthly payment. 
 In August, her mortgage broker, Mr. Barenblatt, found the rates had jumped so drastically that Ms. Gimpel's monthly payments would be $3,375. Not only was this increased rate more expensive; it could also have affected her approval by the co-op board. 
 Mr. Barenblatt arranged for her to get the $417,000 conforming mortgage and paired it with a $32,000 home equity loan. The combined loans will actually cost Ms. Gimpel $150 a month less than she would have paid.

 Re ''One Answer to Global Warming: A New Tax'' (Economic View, Sept. 16), which looked at the possibility of a global carbon tax:
In today's political environment -- a legacy of Ronald Reagan -- it's difficult, if not impossible, to raise taxes for many government activities, much less to address issues like global warming. Pigovian taxes that are intended primarily to fix specific problems are a policy wonk's delight, but in this case let's just give auto manufacturers an incentive to improve mileage and reduce pollution.

To the Editor:
 Re ''Languages Die, but Not Their Last Words'' (news article, Sept. 19): 
 Language loss is a serious global problem, but the National Geographic Society's solution of documenting fragments of endangered languages for posterity is, in most cases, a poor solution. 
 Native peoples in the United States and around the globe are struggling to revitalize their languages by teaching them to their children and making them the means of everyday communication among community members. Through language revitalization, they are reaping proven secondary benefits, including higher student academic achievement and improved community morale and economic opportunity.
 Outside efforts to ''preserve'' language often undermine native peoples' revitalization efforts, since they compete for the time and energy of a tiny number of elderly speakers. Moreover, ''preservationists'' like the National Geographic Society often can pay for speakers' time, while tribal revitalization programs limp along with extremely limited financing. As a result, efforts to ''preserve'' language often ensure a language's death, whereas linguistic collaboration on language revitalization would ensure the language's continuity.

HEADLINE: Coming of Age Upstate: To Grow but Not Change?

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
Richard Russo sets ''Bridge of Sighs'' in a fictitious upstate New York town called Thomaston. It is yet another haven for this author's favorite shirkers, burghers, complainers and human tumbleweeds: the kind of population that turned Mr. Russo's Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Empire Falls'' into an improbably neighborly and nonchalant version of the great American novel. 
 Thomaston resembles Empire Falls in that its geographical, social and economic lines are very precise. These two places also share echoes of Gloversville, N.Y., the factory town where Mr. Russo grew up. Located on the rainbow-trout-striped banks of a polluted river, with a local tannery to thank for this industrial legacy, Thomaston is divided into provinces. The West End is the gritty part of town. The East End is for cautious, upwardly mobile types. The Borough is where the Tannery's owner lives. It is also where the narrator of ''Bridge of Sighs,'' Lou C. Lynch, unfortunately nicknamed Lucy, has managed to plant himself after 60 years of cautious small-town living. 
 But how big is Thomaston in the literary sense rather than the demographic one? That question hovers over this long, expansive book, Mr. Russo's first novel since ''Empire Falls.'' The narrator's self-effacing tone does not lend itself to grand notions. Neither does the book's emphasis on two particular phases of life rather than on the full panorama. ''Don't confuse growing up with changing,'' warns Tessa Lynch, Lucy's acerbic mother, who does her best to keep him firmly planted in childhood, even when he is 60 years old.
 ''Bridge of Sighs'' begins when its three principals are all that age. Two of them, Lucy and the former Sarah Berg, have been married for 40 years. They are about to embark on a trip to Venice, a plan fraught with anxiety, because it may or may not reunite them with an old friend who meant too much to both of them. Sarah was halfway in love with Bobby Marconi, the third main character, when all three were high school seniors in Thomaston. In his own way, which has far more to do with childhood yearning for strength and friendship than with stifled sexuality, Lucy was in love with him, too.
 Having teased its readers with the prospect of a Venice reunion, ''Bridge of Sighs'' then heads for what will be its primary realm: the formative years full of parent-child conflict and schoolyard drama. Mr. Russo uses the slightly cumbersome device of having Lucy write about this in a memoir. Lucy's version of events is subsumed into the book's larger narrative, which switches vantage points frequently and has the quirky, anecdotal spark that is this author's hallmark. It is not possible to describe what Mr. Russo does without letting the word ''quirky'' creep in.
 That's because so much of ''Bridge of Sighs'' concerns itself with oddball details, from petty rivalries between the Lynch and Marconi families to the Lynch in-house dispute about how to run a convenience store. (Tessa's plan involves nonstop disparaging wisecracks and endless amounts of homemade macaroni salad.) But in the midst of these small matters, the big contours of ''Bridge of Sighs'' emerge. They are richly evocative and beautifully wrought, delivered with deceptive ease. Another of Mr. Russo's hallmarks is that wonderfully unfashionable gift for effortless storytelling on a sweeping, multigenerational scale. 
 Lucy emerges as the complex product of his diametrically different parents, his wisecracking Uncle Declan, his childhood years of stunted aspirations and an enduringly traumatic incident at a Thomaston railroad trestle. Meanwhile, Bobby bursts out of such a bitter family life that he reinvents himself as a different person. He has turned himself into Robert Noonan, a famous expatriate American artist living in Venice, when the book catches up with him in adulthood. 
 The Lynch family becomes this novel's dependable linchpin, but Sarah's actions and intuitions are harder to predict. She must accommodate herself to both a wanton, runaway mother and a father who makes a wildly eccentric high school teacher. He is sane, in the opinion of one of his students, only in comparison with Melville's Captain Ahab, whom he eagerly impersonates one day, whalebone prosthesis and all. 
 In class, Sarah's father trumpets the value of big ideas and larger-than-life characters. The small man who runs a grocery is beneath his consideration -- and, as a work of literature, maybe ''Bridge of Sighs'' would be, too. It is a novel of great warmth, charm and intimacy, but not one of earth-shattering revelations. And it does not attain the stature of ''Empire Falls,'' despite the books' surface similarities. Partly, this is because Mr. Russo has covered this terrain before. And partly it is because ''Bridge of Sighs,'' like Lucy Lynch, is shaped by touchingly unglamorous honesty and self-doubt, modest qualities to be sure. 
 This book often wonders how irrevocably its characters were shaped in their youth. And it questions the degree to which they can ever change. In the end, despite a late, unlikely plot twist for Sarah, it presents a world full of patterns that jump from generation to generation. Mr. Russo juxtaposes youthful drama with the subtler, sadder understanding that comes later in life. In the process, he winds up maneuvering Thomaston not into the territory of epic fiction but into the realm of dreams. 
 Some of this book's most memorable moments take the form of sharp, funny storytelling. Some emerge more amorphously through intuitive visions. And each of the main characters has a Bridge of Sighs lodged somewhere in his or her consciousness. Robert Noonan's arrives, unbidden, on one of his canvases. Sarah's also manifests itself through art. And Lucy's exists in the state of semiconsciousness into which he has crept fearfully since that childhood disturbance. It tempts him to get out of Thomaston. Even more persuasively, Mr. Russo tempts his readers to come in.

HEADLINE: Fear but Few Facts In Debate on Voter IDs

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK. 
Online: Court documents and an archive of Adam Liptak's articles and columns: nytimes.comadamliptak.

 BODY:
Is it too much to ask that people who want to vote first show identification with their picture on it? 
 Judge Richard A. Posner, perhaps the most prominent and certainly the most provocative federal appeals court judge in America, thinks not.
 ''It is exceedingly difficult to maneuver in today's America without a photo ID,'' Judge Posner wrote for a divided panel of the federal appeals court in Chicago in January, upholding an Indiana voter identification law enacted in 2005. ''Try flying, or even entering a tall building such as the courthouse in which we sit.'' 
 But somewhere between 13 million and 22 million Americans of voting age, most of them poor, get by without driver's licenses, passports and other kinds of government documents bearing their pictures, perhaps because they do not have the money to drive, much less to fly. 
 Judge Posner seemed to think it a small burden to ask such people to get a photo ID in order to vote. 
 ''That's the perspective of the typical ivory-tower, elitist lawyer,'' said Daniel P. Tokaji, who teaches election law at Ohio State. In a private conference today, the Supreme Court will consider whether to hear an appeal from Judge Posner's decision.
 Indiana has the strictest voter-identification law in the nation, lawyers for the Indiana Democratic Party told the Supreme Court in July, but a handful of states have similar ones and more than a dozen are considering following suit. ''The restrictive conditions imposed in Indiana are a harbinger,'' the brief said. 
 A few weeks ago, a federal judge in Georgia proved that prediction correct. Reversing his own earlier decision, the judge, Harold L. Murphy, allowed that state's voter identification law to go into effect, writing that ''the photo ID requirement is rationally related to preventing fraud in voting.'' That is, of course, true so far as it goes.
 But there are not a lot of facts in this debate.
 ''As far as anyone knows,'' Judge Posner conceded, ''no one in Indiana, and not many people elsewhere, are known to have been prosecuted for impersonating a registered voter.''
 Indeed, said Richard L. Hasen, an authority on election law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, ''there has been a lot of talk about fraud but very little evidence.''
 On the other hand, no one knows how many people otherwise inclined to vote would decide not to because getting a photo ID would be a hassle, though a report this month from the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank, found that voter identification laws ''largely do not have the claimed negative impact on voter turnout.'' 
 The available evidence, thin though it is on both sides, does suggest that ''the number of legitimate voters who would fail to bring photo identification to the polls is several times higher than the number of fraudulent voters,'' Spencer A. Overton, a law professor at George Washington University, wrote in an article on voter identification published in the Michigan Law Review in February. 
 What is perfectly clear, though, is that the legitimate voters facing a new barrier are not a random cross-section. 
 ''No doubt most people who don't have photo ID are low on the economic ladder,'' Judge Posner wrote, ''and thus, if they do vote, are more likely to vote for Democratic than Republican candidates.''
 That may explain why support for voter ID laws tends to be split along party lines. Republicans like the laws; Democrats do not. 
 That is true in state legislatures, which is not surprising, and in the federal courts, which is more troubling. The three-judge panel in the Indiana case, for instance, split along partisan lines, with judges appointed by Republican presidents in the majority. 
 And when all 11 active judges on the court refused to rehear the case, four judges noted dissents. With a single exception, every dissenting judge was appointed by a Democratic president and every one else was appointed by a Republican. (On the other hand, Judge Murphy, who upheld the Georgia law, was appointed by President Jimmy Carter.)
 ''Let's not beat around the bush,'' Judge Terence T. Evans, a Clinton appointee, wrote in his dissent from Judge Posner's panel decision. ''The Indiana voter photo ID law is a not-too-thinly-veiled attempt to discourage Election Day turnout by certain folks believed to skew Democratic.''
 Lacking evidence of actual fraud, proponents of the laws have started to rely on an unusual argument, one given credence by the Supreme Court in a hurried and unsigned decision last year allowing an Arizona election to go forward in the face of a challenge to that state's voter identification law.
 ''Voters who fear their legitimate votes will be outweighed by fraudulent ones will feel disenfranchised,'' the decision said. 
 Did you catch that? The reason to risk actual disenfranchisement is to combat the possibility that some voters may ''feel'' disenfranchised because they think their votes may count less thanks to unproven fraud. The recent Georgia decision cited that bit of legal logic. 
 Judge Evans, in his dissent, said it might be nice to have some facts before putting the right to vote at risk.
 ''Is it wise,'' Judge Evans asked, ''to use a sledgehammer to hit either a real or imaginary fly on a glass coffee table?''

To the Editor:
 Re ''This Is Your (Father's) Brain on Drugs,'' by Mike Males (Op-Ed, Sept. 17):
 The ''ballooning crises'' among baby boomers that Mr. Males lists are really no surprise. What else might you expect from a generation whose mantra was, ''If it feels good, it's O.K.''? 
 So many of the accepted beliefs of our generation have proved to be, dare I say, shallow. Judgment became taboo, as did the concepts of right, wrong and sacrifice. 
 The effect on oneself became the primary consideration for making decisions.
 Doing whatever feels good is no more satisfying for the middle-aged than it is for teenagers. Like anything good, self-respect has to be earned. 
 Making the hard decisions and doing what is right may be a lost message, but it is still one that delivers in the end.
 Andrea Economos Scarsdale, N.Y., Sept. 17, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Mike Males refutes the claim that adolescents are neurologically prone to risky behavior by showing that in fact, adults today take more risks than their children. 
 This approach applies nicely to another of the claims lobbed at teenagers: the ''neuroscientific'' assertion that teenagers lack the capacity to plan for the future.
 Today's adults save less than any generation since the Depression. They have failed to mount a serious response to global warming. They have raided the Social Security trust fund and have run up a $9 trillion national debt to finance their spending and tax cuts. 
 The hasty decision to invade Iraq and the subprime mortgage debacle also constitute failures of long-term planning.
 Today's teenagers are going to have to clean up after the boomers' oil and spending binges. Let's hope they act more mature than their parents. 
 Stephen Serene Washington, Sept. 17, 2007
 To the Editor:
 A small amount of time invested toward understanding the dynamics of cultural transmission among human beings would benefit those in the scientific community. Those who proclaim that the development of the brain's cognitive control system alone is responsible for maturational behavior are arguing against the weight of thousands of years of human social evolution.
 Adolescents have always been initiated into adult behavior by the tribal systems they were born into, regardless of locale or history. It was never unusual for 15-year-olds to take their place in the circle of adulthood and be accepted as thus when this occurred.
 Our contemporary culture does not have a very good system in place for fostering psychological maturation. Thousands of chronological adults remain in adolescence, while the adolescents themselves are not mentored to cross that maturational threshold.
 My practice is spent with both teenagers and adults. I have found that both age groups are searching at the deepest level for someone or something to pull them, as Robert Bly has stated, ''over the line'' to full psychological adulthood.
 Peter E. Gradilone New Rochelle, N.Y., Sept. 17, 2007
 To the Editor:
 While it's true that neuroscientists don't know everything about the brain and how it functions, we do know that adults do not suddenly become violent, irresponsible, accident-prone, beer-swilling, pill-popping reprobates in midlife. 
 Typically, their misbehavior is only the most recent example of a longstanding pattern that began, ironically enough, in adolescence and illustrates the downside of having an adaptive brain, which can change for the worse as well as for the better.
 Perhaps if we had known then how experience, such as youthful experiments with addictive drugs, alter the physical fabric of the brain in long-lasting ways, or had intervened while their immature brains were still maximally pliant, more baby boomers would be good examples for their children, rather than an embarrassment to them.
 Debra Niehoff Newtown, Pa., Sept. 18, 2007 The writer is the author of a book about the biology of the brain and violence.
 To the Editor:
 There may be a bigger picture than the one Mike Males presents when he reveals the hypocrisy of middle-age adults wagging fingers at adolescents.
 I suspect that many of these badly behaving adults come from the lower and middle economic classes. 
 Given this era of unprecedented wealth for an exclusive few; the decline of real wages; astronomical higher-education costs; health care and housing woes; the obsolescence and theft of pensions; not to mention mergers, layoffs and outsourcing, it's no surprise that adults increasingly turn to alcohol, crime, drugs and risky sex to escape their woes.
 Mr. Males has laid out the human costs of American capitalism. The remedy? Electing politicians whose ideas will create positive social and economic change for all, not for the few. 
 It's time we take care of the families on Main Street, not just Wall Street.

HEADLINE: Risky Loans Help Build Ghost Town of New Homes

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Along the streets of Far Rockaway, many recently built two- and three-family town houses sit waiting for even one family to move in. Some have boarded-up windows, while others have clumps of garbage in driveways that have never seen a car. Desperate developers hoping to cover their bets -- and stem their losses -- tape up both For Rent and For Sale signs inside windows that face nearly deserted streets.
 The same blocks were once home to sprawling single-family houses with wraparound porches. But during the superheated real estate market of just a few years ago, longtime residents sold out to developers who rapidly demolished the old to build rows of plain vanilla town houses sold, it seemed, to anyone who could sign a mortgage application. 
 But as the market cooled and credit got tighter, many of the new homes sat empty. On a few blocks, developers have built nothing but plywood walls to hide the weed-choked lots after the old houses were torn down. 
 ''Folks just went crazy and got into the feeding frenzy,'' said City Councilman James Sanders Jr., whose Far Rockaway office is wedged between undeveloped lots and mostly vacant town houses. ''They thought money was going to come to everybody left, right and center. Irrational exuberance is what I call this.''
 The empty homes and undeveloped lots, he said, are part of the unacknowledged effects of the larger credit and foreclosure crisis in minority neighborhoods, where subprime and predatory loans were common. Real estate values rose steadily, as did the optimism of aspiring first-time buyers, who entered into mortgages without fully understanding the terms of the loan or the responsibilities of ownership. When budgets got tight, they could always refinance, they were told.
 Not anymore. Now, in large swaths of Mr. Sanders's district in southeastern Queens, For Sale signs are as common as trees, as people try to bail out before losing what little equity remains in their homes. Similar scenes are found in central Brooklyn and the northeast Bronx, strongholds of minority homeowners whose fortunes have declined. While regulators have long been reluctant to rescue individuals they considered victims of their own greed or bad decisions, entire communities are now facing the consequences.
 ''Whole neighborhoods are wiped out, crime increases, the neighborhood's reputation goes down, quality of life is undermined, and people can't sell their houses,'' said Susan Saegert, a professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, who recently completed a study of homeowners facing foreclosure. ''That has already happened in Ohio and the Rust Belt. And it is starting to happen in New York.''
 This has not come as a surprise to housing policy analysts and advocates who have been warning about the disastrous consequences of the freewheeling subprime market. At least five years ago, they sounded alarms over the spike in foreclosures among elderly homeowners who had been persuaded to take out costly refinancing loans to do repairs or raise money for emergencies. More recently, they saw a surge of first-time buyers taking out $500,000 mortgages at unfavorable terms even though they earned only $50,000 or less annually.
 Sarah Ludwig, the executive director of the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project, said many people -- first-time buyers who relied upon one-stop shops that provided a mortgage broker, appraiser and lawyer, and homeowners who refinanced their existing mortgages -- were lured by offers of low monthly payments on adjustable rate loans. But those loans could become unaffordable once the interest rates reset, as is expected to happen in the coming months for many mortgages that began in 2005. 
 Ms. Ludwig's group estimates that by year's end, at least 14,700 homeowners in the city could be in default, mostly in minority neighborhoods, which she said were singled out for these loans.
 ''We have seen for the last 10 years a very serious problem with the concentration of high-cost loans, foreclosures and people losing their homes,'' she said. ''What is the toll of these loans?''
 In many cases, when the true costs are revealed, the brokers who arranged the mortgages at unfavorable terms have long moved on with their fees, while the original lenders have already sold the loans on the secondary market to banks that used them to back securities. Increasingly, housing advocates have taken to task the big banks that scooped up these high-risk loans.
 ''The mortgage broker and the lender know this would not work if Wall Street had not been willing to buy these loans,'' said Oda Friedheim, a Legal Aid Society lawyer in Queens who deals with many homeowners. ''I look at this as a civil rights issue in those neighborhoods where people thought having a home was key to building individual wealth. But what happened is the wealth people built through their hard work has been transferred to Wall Street.''
 Predatory lending was just part of a larger problem facing people whose budgets were already stretched thin, Dr. Saegert found in her study. In many cases, she said, family responsibilities pushed stressed homeowners over the edge. ''We saw people who had relatives move into an apartment in the house and not pay anything,'' she said. ''They use resources but don't contribute, and that just stretches you out more. We had one older couple who took in grandchildren when their daughter died, but they were on a fixed budget and had no way to take on the extra jobs to support them.''
 She noted that while people often felt shame at their financial predicament, their efforts to get help were often rebuffed by companies who handled the payments. Unaware of local housing groups that could counsel them, many homeowners skipped paying other debts, ran up huge credit card bills or fell victim to so-called foreclosure rescue scams that tricked them into signing over their deeds.
 ''Their state of mind is the worst,'' Dr. Saegert said. ''The people who can legitimately help them are already overwhelmed and not looking for new clients. The people who are not legit are looking for them and they treat them nice. That is why people end up signing papers now not even thinking about it.''
 When Carolene Brown and her husband, Patrick, faced foreclosure on their two-bedroom home in the Bronx, hardly a week went by that they were not visited by a friendly stranger offering to help. Five times, she said, they paid $500 in cash to swindlers, who claimed they could stop the foreclosure. In time, a friend of her husband's offered to help them save the house. Instead, she said, they wound up signing over the deed to him and had the house sold out from under them. 
 ''People always came to us to help,'' said Ms. Brown, who said she has contacted prosecutors to help her reclaim her home. ''I'm a strong person, and I do not like to talk about certain things. My family is big, and they could have helped me out. But I do not like to complain and ask for stuff. I always said I'd try to make this on my own.''
 Councilman Sanders has heard that often.
 ''People always believe they can turn it around,'' he said. ''But in the end, they're out of here and go to live with one of their children or wherever people go when they're dying of shame.''
 Along the many side streets of Arverne, where low-flying planes approaching Kennedy Airport regularly drown out conversation, Mr. Sanders pointed to block after block where homes were for sale or where failed developments turned into rushed rentals. Even closer to his office in Far Rockaway, unsold town houses have been rented to people he said are receiving government subsidies. 
 ''That creates a different problem of changing the composition of the community,'' he said. ''They tip it from working class and middle class and into a concentration of poverty. You put people into homes who never learned how to manage living in one.''
 Down one block of such homes, young men darted inside at the sight of strangers. Outside another drab development, overflowing garbage cans sat atop dusty patches of weeds and gravel.
 ''There always seemed to be an endless supply of people willing to buy these,'' Mr. Sanders said. ''Now the chickens have come home to roost. And the community is the one that's hurt.''

HEADLINE: Chinatown Residents Frustrated Over Street Closed Since 9/11

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
It was the evening rush one recent night in lower Chinatown, and chaos was unfolding in its usual way. 
 Cars slowed to a crawl around Chatham Square, an asterisk of an intersection where seven streets converge. Traffic safety officers frantically waved their white-gloved hands, trying to unsnarl the mess. Pedestrians, some bent double over walkers, shuffled across streets as disorderly columns of cars roared by.
 But one street, Park Row, which once fed into Chatham Square, was strangely still. Aside from the occasional city bus or official vehicle, it was barren of cars and, instead, was filled with rust-streaked concrete barriers. 
 Park Row has historically been a major four-lane artery linking the financial district to Chinatown. It begins at Broadway by City Hall Park, zigzags under the Brooklyn Bridge, hugs the length of the New York Police Department's headquarters and ends at Chatham Square. 
 To the growing fury of many people living nearby, Park Row's eastern half, from the Brooklyn Bridge to Chatham Square, has been closed to commuter traffic since Sept. 11, 2001, even as other streets and public spaces in Lower Manhattan have reopened.
 The Police Department says that most of Park Row has to be blocked off to protect its headquarters, called One Police Plaza, against terrorist threats, particularly truck bombs. 
 But many people who live and work in the area say the six-year shutdown has harmed the character and economic vibrancy of much of Chinatown. Having the police close by, they say, has done their community more harm than good. 
 Besides Park Row, three other streets near the headquarters are blocked off wholly or in part, though pedestrians and official vehicles are generally allowed through. 
 Residents of Chatham Green, a 21-story co-op on Park Row near Chatham Square, have to show identification every time they drive up to and out of their building because its driveway lies beyond a police barricade and a security checkpoint. A driveway to another residential building, Chatham Towers, is behind the barricade, too. 
 Residents blame the barricades for increased home insurance rates; others complain the barriers slow emergency vehicles. 
 Shop owners at the foot of nearby Mott Street say that business is down and that store turnover and vacancy rates have climbed. Traffic heading through Chatham Square now clogs narrower lanes, like St. James Place and Worth Street. 
 ''I hate it. I don't feel like I have real freedom,'' said Joe D'Amico, 27, a middle school teacher who has lived in Chatham Green for seven years. ''I'm only let into my building at the whim of a cop.''
 Members of the Civic Center Residents Coalition, a group based in Chinatown, have been fighting the security footprint around police headquarters for years. They recognize the department's security concerns but oppose policies they say have placed a chokehold on their neighborhood. The group argues that if police headquarters is such a terrorist mark, then it should be moved out of a residential area altogether.
 ''If closing Park Row is contingent on a target, then remove the target,'' said Jan Lee, a member of the coalition who owns a furniture shop near the foot of Mott Street.
 But Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, said the headquarters was not moving. He said the police had tried to alleviate the impact of the security measures, in part by stopping officers from parking in nearby public spaces and by reopening a stairway that skirts the headquarters' south side and leads down to street level near the Brooklyn Bridge.
 The department also plans to redesign its guard booths and security barriers to make them more attractive, Mr. Browne said, and is involved in efforts to convert two lanes of Park Row into a pedestrian greenway. ''The Police Department has worked hard to be responsive to the community while maintaining the requisite level of security for this sensitive location,'' he said. 
 But many residents see the idea of a greenway as a thinly disguised effort to close Park Row as a thoroughfare for good. ''It sounds like a Trojan horse,'' said Danny Chen, who lives in Chatham Green. 
 Plans are also in the early stages to reconfigure Chatham Square by moving a public square that holds a soaring statue of Lin Ze Xu, a 19th-century Chinese official, and linking the Bowery, on the north side of the square, directly to St. James Place, on the south, and other streets. Many residents are leery about this step too. 
 The coalition has enlisted powerful local figures in its fight, including Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the State Assembly, who represents the Lower East Side and Chinatown. He said the continued closing of Park Row was sure to worsen congestion in Lower Manhattan and Chinatown with the rebuilding of ground zero under way. 
 ''The brilliant minds have to get together,'' Mr. Silver said. ''With all the technology that's available today, they can accommodate the needs of security and the needs of the community.''
 Yet security experts and urban planners say the heightened protection around One Police Plaza is a necessary piece of the post-Sept. 11 landscape. 
 All of New York has had to adapt since the attacks, said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. 
 ''Park Row is not just a corridor to Chinatown, but it's a barrier between the New York Police Department and potential vulnerability,'' he said. 
 Despite the widespread anger caused by the security perimeter, some Chinatown residents say they have seen some benefits. Nita Canapa, an elderly woman who lives in Chatham Green, said it was now easier for her to walk across Park Row. Jin Lei, 40, a computer programmer who also lives in Chatham Green, says he likes the comparable peacefulness of the street and feels more secure. 
 The coalition opposing the security measures has waged successful fights against the police before. 
 Ruling in 2003 on a suit filed by the group, a State Supreme Court judge, Walter B. Tolub, ordered the police to stop using a small park near its headquarters as a parking lot. The group successfully petitioned the city to allow buses to go down Park Row again. The Police Department was ordered in 2005 to conduct an environmental impact study of the street closings around its headquarters, including barricaded parts of Madison and Pearl Streets. 
 The final report is 372 pages long and was released in early August. It concluded that while some effects of the security measures could be mitigated, others, like increased noise and traffic congestion, might be permanent nuisances. 
 But neighborhood leaders say the report understated the impact of the sealed-off streets and wrongly characterized the closings as inevitable. 
 ''This was a critical link for Chinatown, and it's such an insult to Chinatown for them to downplay the impact,'' said Jeanie Chin, a member of the coalition, standing at the foot of Park Row one morning last week. ''They're treating the community the same as terrorists,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Bush to Skip U.N. Talks on Fighting Global Warming

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; John M. Broder contributed reporting from Washington, Andrew C. Revkin from New York and James Kanter from Paris.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
Dozens of world leaders are to gather at the United Nations on Monday for a full agenda of talks on how to fight global warming, and President Bush is skipping all the day's events but the dinner.
 His focus instead is on his own gathering of leaders in Washington later this week, a meeting with the same stated goal, a reduction in the emissions blamed for climate change, but a fundamentally different idea of how to achieve it.
 Mr. Bush's aides say that the parallel meeting does not compete against the United Nations' process -- hijacking it, as his critics charge. They say that Mr. Bush hopes to persuade the nations that produce 90 percent of the world's emissions to come to a consensus that would allow each, including the United States, to set its own policies rather than having limits imposed by binding international treaty. 
 ''It's our philosophy that each nation has the sovereign capacity to decide for itself what its own portfolio of policies should be,'' said James L. Connaughton, the president's chief environmental adviser. 
 Mr. Bush's approach sets the stage for a new round of diplomatic confrontation. And it raises the prospect that he could once again put the United States in the position of objecting to any binding international agreement intended to slow or reverse the emissions linked to rising temperatures.
 Whether Mr. Bush prevails remains to be seen, but the effort is the last chance in his presidency to shape the debate after years of being excoriated for keeping the United States out of the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement that limits the emissions of greenhouse gases from most industrialized countries.
 ''The leadership role of the United States is absolutely essential,'' said Timothy E. Wirth, a former senator and an environmental official in the Clinton administration, who is now president of the United Nations Foundation. ''Unless the United States decides that it wants to be a major and committed leadership player in this and make very specific commitments, much of the rest of the world is effectively going to hide behind the skirts of the United States and not do anything.''
 The growing scientific consensus that humans contribute to rising temperatures and sea levels -- reflected in melting glaciers, shrinking Arctic ice and the concerns raised by former Vice President Al Gore -- has pushed the issue to the top of a crowded diplomatic agenda at the opening of the United Nations General Assembly this week.
 So has the expiration in 2012 of the binding restrictions under the Kyoto Protocol, which was intended to reduce participating countries' emissions of greenhouse gases below the levels recorded in 1990.
 Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, scheduled Monday's forum -- diplomatically speaking, a ''high-level event'' -- to jump-start talks on how to replace Kyoto, saying an agreement needed to be reached by 2009 to avoid ''any vacuum'' after its restrictions lapse. Negotiators are to begin those talks in December in Bali, Indonesia.
 ''Climate change is a challenge to our leadership, skills and vision,'' Mr. Ban said at the United Nations Headquarters last week, ''and we have to address that challenge boldly.''
 About 80 heads of state or government are expected at the meeting, and 154 leaders and officials have signed up to speak. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will represent the United States, though Mr. Bush will attend a closed-door dinner on Monday night. Michael Kozak, a National Security Council official, called the event a ''working-dinner format.''
 Mr. Bush's meeting in Washington this week, to be held over two days, involves 15 countries, or major economies as the White House calls them, as well as the United Nations and the European Union. The 15 countries are the major emitters of greenhouse gases.
 They include the members of the group of industrialized nations, as well as other large countries with developing economies, like Indonesia, Brazil, China and India. Developing countries did not face emissions limits under Kyoto, which was one of the major reasons the United States ultimately opposed it. China, like the United States, has also gone on record as opposing mandatory caps in the future.
 Mr. Bush, long skeptical of reports of human-driven climate change, proposed for the first time this year negotiating a ''long-term global goal'' for cutting emissions, while persuading countries to agree to invest more in research on alternative energy sources and lower trade tariffs for products that reduce emissions. While opposing a binding cap on emissions, either domestically or globally, he has supported some mandatory measures, including increases in renewable fuels like ethanol and higher fuel-efficiency standards, efforts his administration once resisted.
 Briefing reporters before the week's meetings, senior aides emphasized that each nation should decide for itself how to reduce emissions.
 ''The president's central proposition is really this: Tackling global climate change requires all major economies developed and developing to work together,'' said Dan Price, a deputy national security adviser. ''And it requires each to make a contribution consistent with its national circumstances.''
 Critics argue that the administration's approach is not aggressive enough because it remains essentially voluntary.
 ''There's no serious environmental problem that's ever been solved by voluntary measures,'' said David Doniger, climate policy director at the National Resources Defense Council.
 He cited the Montreal Protocol, the 1987 agreement that required countries to ban substances blamed for depleting the earth's ozone layer. That protocol was amended Friday, with American support, to speed up the phasing out of hydrochlorofluorocarbons used in home appliances, refrigeration equipment and air conditioners. 
 European leaders, including allies like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, have also supported setting mandatory caps on emissions. At the Group of 8 meeting this summer, Mrs. Merkel pushed for a 50 percent reduction by 2050 but had to settle for compromise language after President Bush made it clear the United States would not agree to it.
 Mr. Bush's aides are sensitive to the accusation that the White House has ignored climate change. 
 They said that the administration's embrace of voluntary measures and some mandatory steps, like requiring renewable fuels to be mixed with gasoline, was having effects that would be lasting.
 Kevin Fay, executive director of the International Climate Change Partnership, a business group that supports some actions to limit emissions, said there was cautious support for Mr. Bush's talks, though it was tempered by the administration's previous record.
 ''It will take an awful lot,'' Mr. Fay said, ''to overcome the skepticism that has accumulated over the last six years.''

HEADLINE: Iraqi Premier Says Blackwater Shootings Challenge His Nation's Sovereignty

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN and ANDREW E. KRAMER; Ali Hamdani contributed reporting from Baghdad, and Iraqi employees of The New York Times from Basra and Hilla.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki said Sunday that the shooting of Iraqi civilians last week by Blackwater USA, a private American security company, amounted to a challenge to the nation's sovereignty, and he added that his government was working jointly with the United States to bring those responsible to justice.
 In an interview with The Associated Press in his New York hotel suite before his appearance at the United NationsGeneral Assembly, he said: ''The Iraqi government is responsible for its citizens, and it cannot be accepted for a security company to carry out a killing. There are serious challenges to the sovereignty of Iraq.'' 
 The A. P. said Mr. Maliki had used the Arabic word tajawiz, which can be translated either as affronts or challenges. 
 On Sept. 16, Blackwater security guards opened fire on civilians in Nisour Square in western Baghdad, killing at least 11 people and reminding Iraqis of the behavior of private Western security companies operating in the country. The episode was the seventh in which Iraqi authorities had cited Blackwater for the injurious behavior of its guards toward civilians. 
 However, an Iraqi security official said the government was compelled to allow Blackwater to remain in operation in Iraq in spite of deep misgivings about the company's role here. Tahseen al-Sheikhly, a spokesman for the Iraqi security forces, said that immediately removing Blackwater's hundreds of armed guards could create a security vacuum in the capital, forcing American commanders to redeploy troops from elsewhere in the country. That could leave other volatile areas thinly patrolled. 
 ''If Blackwater left at this moment, it might leave a security gap because most of the embassies and most of the foreign organizations that are working in Iraq'' rely on Blackwater, Mr. Sheikhly said at a news conference with a spokesman for the American military in Baghdad. ''This will create a security imbalance.''
 ''That's why the Iraqi government preferred to be patient on activating this decision to stop them,'' he said. ''But the government is still serious in finding certain rules'' to govern private security contractors. ''We would like to have some laws,'' he said.
 Meanwhile, an American soldier was killed and another was wounded when a sophisticated roadside bomb, known as an explosively formed penetrator, detonated near their patrol during combat operations in East Baghdad on Saturday, the United States military said.
 A British soldier died Friday in Britain from wounds sustained in Iraq last week, the Defense Ministry said Saturday.
 Over all, however, the American commander in Baghdad said violence had continued to diminish in the capital. In a statement released Sunday, the commander, Maj. Gen. Joseph F. Fil Jr., said there had been a 70 percent decrease in the casualties caused by car bombs since an increase in the number of American troops in the city in mid-February. His statement also said that there had been a 125 percent increase in the rate at which car bombs were discovered by security forces before they were exploded by insurgents. 
 Before February, just one-fifth of Baghdad's neighborhoods were free of organized insurgent activity. Now, more than half of Baghdad's neighborhoods have improved to the point that economic investment can begin, General Fil said. 
 The counterinsurgency doctrine embraced by the top United States' commander in Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus, is ''clear, hold and build'' -- meaning that insurgents first need to be removed from neighborhoods, then the military needs to keep them from returning and then it is possible to start making investments and building up the area. 
 However, in a signal that violence remains the norm here, 10 bodies were found in Baghdad on Sunday and there were clashes in Basra between two Shiite militias. There was also a reminder of the longstanding antagonism in Iraq toward the United Nations when a roadside bomb exploded Sunday near the organization's former headquarters in Baghdad, which is now deserted. 
 The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, recently announced that the international organization would have a more robust presence in Iraq and would consider expanding its offices in the northern city of Erbil and perhaps would open an outpost in Basra, in the south of the country.

HEADLINE: U.S. Focus on Ahmadinejad Puzzles Iranians

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

DATELINE: TEHRAN 

 BODY:
When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was first elected president, he said Iran had more important issues to worry about than how women dress. He even called for allowing women into soccer games, a revolutionary idea for revolutionary Iran.
 Today, Iran is experiencing the most severe crackdown on social behavior and dress in years, and women are often barred from smoking in public, let alone attending a stadium event.
 Since his inauguration two years ago, Mr. Ahmadinejad has grabbed headlines around the world, and in Iran, for outrageous statements that often have no more likelihood of being put into practice than his plan for women to attend soccer games. He has generated controversy in New York in recent days by asking to visit ground zero -- a request that was denied -- and his scheduled appearance at Columbia University has drawn protests. 
 But it is because of his provocative remarks, like denying the Holocaust and calling for Israel to be wiped off the map, that the United States and Europe have never known quite how to handle him. In demonizing Mr. Ahmadinejad, the West has served him well, elevating his status at home and in the region at a time when he is increasingly isolated politically because of his go-it-alone style and ineffective economic policies, according to Iranian politicians, officials and political experts. 
 Political analysts here say they are surprised at the degree to which the West focuses on their president, saying that it reflects a general misunderstanding of their system.
 Unlike in the United States, in Iran the president is not the head of state nor the commander in chief. That status is held by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, whose role combines civil and religious authority. At the moment, this president's power comes from two sources, they say: the unqualified support of the supreme leader, and the international condemnation he manages to generate when he speaks up.
 ''The United States pays too much attention to Ahmadinejad,'' said an Iranian political scientist who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. ''He is not that consequential.''
 That is not to say that Mr. Ahmadinejad is insignificant. He controls the mechanics of civil government, much the way a prime minister does in a state like Egypt, where the real power rests with the president. He manages the budget and has put like-minded people in positions around the country, from provincial governors to prosecutors. His base of support is the Basiji militia and elements of the Revolutionary Guards. 
 But Mr. Ahmadinejad has not shown the same political acumen at home as he has in riling the West. Two of his ministers have quit, criticizing his stewardship of the state. The head of the central bank resigned. The chief judge criticized him for his management of the government. His promise to root out corruption and redistribute oil wealth has run up against entrenched interests.
 Even a small bloc of members of Parliament that once aligned with Mr. Ahmadinejad has largely given up, officials said. ''Maybe it comes as a surprise to you that I voted for him,'' said Emad Afrough, a conservative member of Parliament. ''I liked the slogans demanding justice.''
 But he added: ''You cannot govern the country on a personal basis. You have to use public knowledge and consultation.''
 Rather than focusing so much attention on the president, the West needs to learn that in Iran, what matters is ideology -- Islamic revolutionary ideology, according to politicians and political analysts here. Nearly 30 years after the shah fell in a popular revolt, Iran's supreme leader also holds title of guardian of the revolution. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's power stems not from his office per se, but from the refusal of his patron, Ayatollah Khamenei, and some hard-line leaders, to move beyond Iran's revolutionary identity, which makes full relations with the West impossible. There are plenty of conservatives and hard-liners who take a more pragmatic view, wanting to retain ''revolutionary values'' while integrating Iran with the world, at least economically. But they are not driving the agenda these days, and while that could change, it will not be the president who makes that call.
 ''Iran has never been interested in reaching an accommodation with the United States,'' the Iranian political scientist said. ''It cannot reach an accommodation as long as it retains the current structure.''
 Another important factor restricts Mr. Ahmadinejad's hand: while ideology defines the state, the revolution has allowed a particular class to grow wealthy and powerful. 
 When Mr. Ahmadinejad was first elected, it appeared that Iran's hard-liners had a monopoly on all the levers of power. But today it is clear that Mr. Ahmadinejad is not a hard-liner in the traditional sense. His talk of economic justice and a redistribution of wealth, for example, ran into a wall of existing vested interests, including powerful clergy members and military leaders.
 ''Ahmadinejad is a phenomenon,'' said Mohammad Ali Abtahi, a former vice president under the more moderate administration of Mohammad Khatami. ''On a religious level he is much more of a hard-liner than the traditional hard-liners. But on a political level, he does not have the support of the hard-liners.''
 In the long run, political analysts here say, a desire to preserve those vested interests will drive Iran's agenda. That means that the allegiance of the political elite is to the system, not a particular president. If this president were ever perceived as outlasting his usefulness, he would probably take his place in history beside other presidents who failed to change the orientation of the system.
 Iranians will go to the polls in less than two years to select a president. There are so many pressures on the electoral system here, few people expect an honest race. The Guardian Council, for example, controlled by hard-liners, must approve all candidates. 
 But whether Mr. Ahmadinejad wins or loses, there is no sense here in Iran that the outcome will have any impact on the fundamentals of Iran's relations with the world or the government's relation to its own society.
 ''The situation will get worse and worse,'' said Saeed Leylaz, an economist and former government official. ''We are moving to a point where no internal force can change things.''

HEADLINE: A Frenchman in a Hurry Maps His Path

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO and ALISON SMALE

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
President Nicolas Sarkozy of France strode into the Napoleon III salon of the Elysee Palace and staked his claim to the leadership of Europe. 
 He took credit for pushing through a revised treaty for the European Union. He declared that France would return to NATO's military command if his conditions were met. He announced that the French Navy would help protect food delivery to Somalia. He assailed his fellow Europeans for having no ideas. 
 ''I can't be criticized for wanting first place for France,'' Mr. Sarkozy said in an interview with The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune, his first with English-language news organizations since becoming president in May. He added, ''If France doesn't take the lead, who will?'' 
 This projection of French power is like that of de Gaulle, in the 1950s and 60s, and every French leader since. But Mr. Sarkozy departs from classic Gaullist doctrine by suggesting that the path to that goal sometimes lies in aligning France -- and Europe -- alongside Washington rather than as a counterpoint to it. 
 He is, his critics and admirers agree, a man in a hurry. In the hourlong encounter conducted in French on Friday evening, Mr. Sarkozy resisted efforts to be drawn into small talk. 
 Visibly restless, at times brusque, he greeted his guests with stiff handshakes and unadorned hellos. Perpetually in motion, he rocked uncomfortably in a green brocade armchair and gripped the backs of the gilt chairs on either side of him. His jaw muscles twitched. His gait was awkward. He cut off his interviewers in midsentence. 
 He stumbled twice on the word ''multilateralism,'' laughing at himself the second time and turning to his national security adviser, Jean-David Levitte, to finish the word for him. 
 But there was nothing hesitant about the way Mr. Sarkozy, the 52-year-old leader on the French right, laid out his agenda before departing for New York to make his debut at the United NationsGeneral Assembly.
 For Mr. Sarkozy, the most burning issue is Iran's nuclear program. France's position, he said, is clear: ''No nuclear weapon for Iran, an arsenal of sanctions to convince them, negotiations, discussions, firmness. And I don't want to hear anything else that would not contribute usefully to the discussion today.''
 ''For my part, I don't use the word war,'' he said, signaling that he would tolerate no dissent on the issue.
 His words were in sharp contrast to those of his foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, who said in a radio and television interview last Sunday that France was preparing for the ''worst'' situation with Iran -- war. Mr. Kouchner has since declared that was misunderstood.
 Mr. Sarkozy also contradicted his foreign minister a second time, saying that Mr. Kouchner's public offer to visit Iran was a nonstarter. ''I don't think that the conditions for a trip to Tehran are present right now,'' he said. ''We can talk things over in the halls of the United Nations.''
 Asked whether France agreed with the Bush administration that ''all options are on the table,'' he replied, ''The expression 'all the options are on the table' is not mine. And I do not make it mine.'' He added, ''I am not determining my position on the Iranian question based on the position of the United States alone.'' 
 He equally refused to choose between a nuclear-armed Iran and the use of force, saying, ''It is exactly what the Iranian leaders want. I am not obliged to fall into this trap.''
 Mr. Sarkozy has been dropping hints that France wants to return to the military command of NATO more than four decades after de Gaulle abruptly abandoned that wing of the alliance. 
 In the interview, Mr. Sarkozy announced for the first time two conditions that would have to be met beforehand: American acceptance of an independent European defense capability and a leading French role in NATO's command structures ''at the highest level.'' 
 Mr. Sarkozy's predecessor, Jacques Chirac, sought to rejoin NATO's military command, but in 1997 the Clinton administration rejected the conditions set by Paris. Mr. Sarkozy also seemed to put the onus not on France but on the United States. ''I would make progress on European defense a condition for moving into the integrated command, and I am asking our American friends to understand that,'' he said. 
 He also made clear that in order to even ''consider'' returning to the fold, NATO's ''governing bodies'' would have to make considerable space for France. 
 ''France can only resume its place if room is made,'' he said. ''It's hard to take a place that isn't reserved for you.'' 
 Mr. Sarkozy, a lifelong campaigner and politician, expressed admiration for the American presidential campaign, saying he followed the debates among various candidates during his summer vacation in New England. ''I thought, My God, what a long race!'' he exclaimed. ''What energy you must have to put yourself through something like that! All praise to American democracy!''
 He called himself ''very proud'' that a number of candidates, including the former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, ''quoted my writings.'' And he ticked off a number of American political luminaries he had met, including Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican; former Vice President Al Gore and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, adding that he would again meet Senator Barack Obama, the Illinois Democrat.
 ''I want to tell the American people that the French people are their friends,'' he said. ''We are not simply allies. We are friends. I am proud of being a friend of the Americans. You know, I am saying this to The New York Times, but I have said it to the French, which takes a little more courage and is a little more difficult. I have never concealed my admiration for American dynamism, for the fluidity of American society, for its ability to raise people of different identities to the very highest levels.'' 
 Mr. Sarkozy, who has been accused of being too enamored of all things American, said he considered France and the United States to be on equal footing and somehow better than many others, because they believe that their values are universal and therefore destined to ''radiate'' throughout the world. The Germans, the Spaniards, the Italians, the Chinese, by contrast, do not think that way, he said. 
 Mr. Sarkozy defended his decision to summer in America, and not somewhere in France, saying, ''I don't see why I should have given up going to the United States because a small part of the French elite professes an anti-Americanism that in no way corresponds to what the French people think -- in no way at all.'' 
 He listed the things that appealed to him during his two-week vacation: the countryside, the shopping malls, the restaurants, swimming in the lake, jogging in the woods while his 10-year-old son rode his bike alongside him. ''I loved the kindness and simplicity of the people,'' Mr. Sarkozy said. 
 Regarding his stay in New York this week, aides to Mr. Sarkozy said he did not plan to meet President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, who will also address the General Assembly. 
 Breaking with traditional French policy, which has long resisted sanctions as a diplomatic weapon, Mr. Sarkozy laid out a far-reaching strategy to punish Iran economically -- through United Nations and European sanctions and by exerting pressure on French and other nations' corporations and banks not to do business there. 
 Strengthened sanctions,he predicted, ''eventually will produce results'' in persuading Iran to curb nuclear activities prohibited under Security Council resolutions. 
 Mr. Sarkozy expressed support for the current American-led push in the Council for a third sanctions resolution against Iran, but acknowledged that it might not be possible to achieve. Other punitive measures must be pursued, with other countries in Europe, he said, calling such an approach ''an international, a multilateral, decision,'' and as such one that suits him. 
 Specifically, Mr. Sarkozy said that France was asking its own companies ''to refrain from going to Iran.'' France already has urged its oil giant Total and its gas firm Gaz de France not to bid for new projects in Iran and urged French banks to stop doing business there.
 Turning to the fate of Iraq, Mr. Sarkozy made plain that the country must remain intact, and said it would stand a better chance of developing without a foreign military presence. Yet he stated that France itself, which opposed the United States-led invasion in 2003 and has declined to send police or military trainers there, would offer no initiatives beyond the recent trip to Baghdad by Mr. Kouchner. ''France has no mission to go into Iraq,'' Mr. Sarkozy said. 
 Mr. Sarkozy is known for his no-nonsense approach, but he seemed especially tense on Friday. Aides said he was having a difficult day and was determined not to stumble on the delicate subject of Iran. During the campaign, he admitted that he suffers from migraines, but an aide said he was not suffering from pain during the interview.
 The brusque demeanor and nonstop movement during the interview vanished during a brief photo session afterward in his office. At one point, he posed for a photograph with the two women who interviewed him, gripping his arms around their shoulders. ''I have a good job,'' he said.
 Asked about a long, decorative silver sword that lay on his coffee table, he reinforced what he called his message of peace. ''It is,'' he said, ''a sword of peace.''

HEADLINE: Savor Those Curly Fries: Planet Hollywood Is Back (Again)

BYLINE: By RICHARD SIKLOS

 BODY:
The celebrity investors were all smiles for the groundbreaking of the Planet Hollywood casino in Las Vegas, Sly, Bruce, Demi and Arnold among them. ''It was a lot of pomp and circumstance,'' Sylvester Stallone recalled. ''I think there was a gold shovel.'' 
 The year was 1998, and despite the gilded photo opportunity, the casino plan soon fell apart. It jolted the stock of Planet Hollywood, the fast-growing chain of restaurants adorned with movie memorabilia that tried to capitalize on the American appetite for big stars and haute junk food like chicken breaded in Cap'n Crunch cereal. 
 Instead, Planet Hollywood has stood as a cautionary tale about the perils of celebrity and hype, as the company filed for bankruptcy protection not once but twice shortly after the Las Vegas groundbreaking. 
 ''That was the first of the wobblies,'' Robert Earl, the founder of Planet Hollywood, recalled in an interview. 
 But Mr. Earl was determined to eradicate the sting of that collapse, which was memorialized in headlines like ''Rocky K-O'd'' and ''Arnold Terminated.'' The name Planet Hollywood may still be shorthand for a cultural and financial bubble. But Mr. Earl, who lost more than $1 billion on the way down, has managed to retain control of the company, now a much slimmer, privately held chain of a dozen or so restaurants. 
 The real embodiment of his redemption, however, is taking shape in the hulking form of a shiny new Planet Hollywood Casino and Resort on the site of the old Aladdin casino in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip. 
 The casino's official opening is slated for the weekend of Nov. 16. Mr. Earl is overseeing final renovations that include, among the 2,500 rooms, penthouses named after celebrities who will occupy their namesake lairs while in town, but which the rest of us can inhabit for as little as $599 a night. 
 ''I can't abide by failure,'' Mr. Earl, 56, who is known among his friends and employees for his high energy and boldly hued shirts and socks, said in an interview.
 Mr. Earl also plans to announce a new roster of celebrities, including Pete Sampras and Roger Clemens, who will be affiliated with the casino and hotel and serve as its ambassadors. The idea is similar to one used in the original Planet Hollywood, where a lineup of 32 celebrities received stakes in the project, but this time, he said, only Bruce Willis and Mr. Stallone are co-investors. 
 ''I've been strongly trying to communicate to everyone that 'this is not your old Planet,' '' Mr. Earl said. 
 Mr. Earl's planned comeback, like all things Vegas, comes with risks. After all, outsiders have had a sorry history of investing in Las Vegas gambling. Despite its prime location on 35 acres at the heart of the Strip, the Aladdin site has been a white elephant for reasons that include architecture, marketing and karma. 
 ''Even with the revamping that has been done on behalf of Planet Hollywood, I don't know how survivable it is,'' William R. Eadington, director of the Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming at the University of Nevada, Reno, said. ''It certainly is a better looking facility than it was before.''
 The complex includes a 7,000-seat theater where Mr. Earl wants to hold movie premieres (it already serves as the set for the NBC TV show ''America's Got Talent''), a studio for the celebrity news program ''Extra,'' and new nightclubs operated by Miami impresarios. All would be intended to give guests a constant whiff of proximity to camera lights and those bathed in them. 
 Part of Mr. Earl's plan is to try to attract events that will draw celebrities and hence a crowd. 
 ''He knows how to look after people,'' Mr. Willis said in an interview. ''He's just a really generous guy.'' 
 Mr. Earl was born in Britain to a father who was an entertainer and worked with the Hard Rock Cafe chain. He began the first Planet Hollywood in New York in 1991 in partnership with Keith Barish, a film producer and entrepreneur who left the company after it went public. 
 Planet Hollywood went public in 1996 at $18 a share, representing an enormous multiple of earnings. It rose to $32, giving the company a paper value of $3.4 billion before the air went out of the souffle. The stock was delisted just before its first bankruptcy in 1999. Most of its outlets were closed, and Mr. Earl's reputation took a pounding. 
 Mr. Earl takes the blame for much of the plunge, saying he opened too many outlets too quickly and should have avoided bankruptcy altogether. He eventually put together a reorganization plan with creditors under which he retained 51 percent of the brand, predicated on his zeal for redemption. One of the bondholders who backed his reorganization, a fund run by Bay Harbour Management, is now his partner in the casino company. 
 Having declined to 9 outlets after the bankruptcy from a peak of 47, the restaurant chain today has 19 restaurants in places like Times Square and Walt Disney World, with some as far-flung as Kuala Lumpur and Dubai. The chain is privately held, but Mr. Earl and his partners said sales at restaurants have been on the upswing, and they are finding new locations in Asia and the Middle East. (And Mr. Earl has embarked on other ventures, including a stake in a Liverpool soccer club, real estate projects, a half-interest in a small London casino and a start-up sandwich chain, all of which he has financed separately.)
 After a $650 million recapitalization and renovation of what was the bankrupt Aladdin, Mr. Earl, flanked by Mr. Willis, replaced the old name with a Planet Hollywood sign this spring. For the last two years, much of the site had been swaddled in some form of scaffolding; Mr. Earl and his partners have kept the casino running day and night to retain the property's gambling license.
 Mr. Earl declines to say how much he has personally put into the casino business, but together he and Bay Harbour own 51 percent after they and other investors pumped around $100 million in new equity into the casino in 2003. A third partner, Starwood Hotels, was brought in to affiliate the project with the Sheraton brand and tie it into Starwood's vast reservations network. The size of Starwood's stake has not been disclosed.
 Bay Harbour is also Mr. Earl's partner in Planet Hollywood International, the restaurant company.
 Mr. Stallone said Mr. Earl had been obsessive about every detail in the buildup to the casino opening. ''He just has an insatiable desire to perform, to be around people, and he's incredibly competitive,'' Mr. Stallone said. ''Las Vegas appeals to every instinct that he has -- and it couldn't be a better match between man, machine and environment.''
 But the question remains whether Planet Hollywood can resonate with crowds in the same way it did when it soared a decade or so ago. Celebrity as a marketing element is much more pervasive than it was even a decade ago, because of the Internet, reality TV, endless awards shows and celebrity magazines. 
 In Las Vegas, big casinos like the Bellagio, the MGM Grand and the Wynn (which rose on the site of the earlier Planet Hollywood project) draw their share of entertainment celebrities, and the small Hard Rock Casino and the Palms casinos, which was the host of the recent MTV Music Video Awards, have become popular destinations for the young Hollywood crowd. 
 As far as Mr. Earl is concerned, his creation has always been aimed at the middle-America market, rather than the Paris and Britney party set. And, as it happens, his planned resurgence comes as the core of middle-age stars originally aligned with Planet Hollywood have enjoyed bounces in their careers: Mr. Stallone and Mr. Willis recently starred in new installments of their ''Rocky'' and ''Die Hard'' franchises. 
 Demi Moore has enjoyed a revival of her acting career also, and while Arnold Schwarzenegger is no longer in the entertainment business or associated with Planet Hollywood, his fame is undiminished. 
 Douglas Teitelbaum, a partner with Bay Harbour who has worked closely with Mr. Earl since the chain's bankruptcy, said that if Planet Hollywood succeeds as a gambling brand, the partners will look at expanding to Atlantic City and elsewhere. 
 One example of how Mr. Earl and his partners are being more careful this time is a huge time-share development being built on the property that could double the number of rooms at the hotel and casino complex. Rather than invest cash in the project, their group contributed 4 of its 35 acres to a large time-share development in exchange for a share of sales, Mr. Teitelbaum said. 
 He added that another Planet Hollywood stock offering could even be in the cards if all goes well in Vegas, something Mr. Earl said he would be happy to avoid. Just by opening the Las Vegas location, he said, ''I will feel that I have done what I had to do.'' 
 For Mr. Stallone, who knows a thing or two about redemption stories, his friend's earlier stumbles bring to mind a metaphor. 
 ''It was a little too early,'' he said. ''It was like putting the fighter in the ring who's a little too green. There were a lot of people out there who were not wishing us well.''

HEADLINE: No Bank Bailouts, Briton Says

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: BOURNEMOUTH, England, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
Britain's Treasury chief, Alistair Darling, told the Labor Party's annual convention on Sunday that Britain would not protect businesses that make bad judgments, despite a billion-dollar rescue of a struggling bank. 
 A run on deposits at Northern Rock last week, the first major financial jitters since the Labor Party took office in 1997, has called into question the handling of the economy by the party's new leader, Prime Minister Gordon Brown. 
 Customers formed long lines for days outside Northern Rock branches to withdraw savings, and the bank has absorbed a reported $:3 billion ($6 billion) in publicly financed loans to stave off collapse.
 Mr. Darling, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said Britain needed new regulation to protect depositors and there were lessons to draw from the episode.
 ''No government should be in the business of protecting executives who make the wrong call or bad decisions,'' he said. ''My job is to protect ordinary savers, so we need to strengthen protection.''
 Mr. Darling told The Times of London on Friday that he was considering deposit insurance like the United States has, which would protect customers' money in the event of a bank's collapse.
 Mr. Brown said Sunday that woes at Northern Rock were a direct result of the credit crisis in the United States, which had prompted turmoil across Europe.
 Mr. Darling told delegates: ''There was a time when a small bank in America got into trouble, it was bad news for that town, or state, but nowhere else. But today, when a Florida householder defaults on his mortgage, the effects are felt not just in America but across the world.''
 Troubles at Northern Rock became public on Sept. 14 when the Bank of England announced that it had made money available to the mortgage lender because it had trouble securing loans from other banks, many still smarting from the collapse of the American subprime mortgage market.
 Lawmakers blamed the Bank of England's governor, Mervyn A. King, for failing to prevent a run on deposits. Legislators said he should have announced earlier his plans to inject money into the longer-term money market.

HEADLINE: Cleaning Up China

DATELINE: In 1991, Lawrence Summers 

 BODY:
then the World Bank's chief economist and later Bill Clinton's Treasury secretary -- wrote a memo suggesting that the bank should encourage the world's dirty industries to move to developing countries. The forgone earnings of workers sickened or killed by pollution would be lower in low-wage countries, he noted, while people in poor countries also cared less about a clean environment. ''The economic logic of dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest-wage country is impeccable,'' he wrote. 
 Mr. Summers later apologized, saying his words were ''sardonic counterpoint,'' meant to spur new thinking about the environment and development. In any case, the World Bank's encouragement wasn't needed. In the 16 years since, a large share of the world's polluting industries have migrated to the largest low-wage country of all, China, helping to turn big swaths of its landscape into an environmental disaster zone.
 China makes more than a third of the world's steel, half of its cement, about a third of its aluminum. It also consumes more coal than the United States, Europe and Japan combined. Its environmental degradation is a match for Dickens at his bleakest: airborne pollution causes more than 650,000 premature deaths a year. 
 The problem doesn't stay there. China is about to surpass, or has already surpassed, the United States as the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. 
 China's government bears primary responsibility for failing to address the devastating environmental consequences of its breakneck growth. Industrialized countries, whose companies and consumers have benefited from China's cheap labor and polluting industries, also bear responsibility and must work to fix this mess. 
 Beijing has begun to realize that its current path is not cost-free. A study commissioned by the government conservatively estimated that costs imposed by environmental degradation added up to 3 percent of G.D.P. in 2004. The government has since set targets to reduce energy use and cut emissions. China's authoritarian leaders, however, are fearful of anything that might require slower growth and have strangled most domestic debate about the environmental disaster. After the first report they dropped the effort to measure pollution's economic impact, and the targets are unlikely to be met. 
 Beijing could start investing some of the hundreds of billions of dollars China earns on exports in social and environmental programs at home. Foreign companies could help by requiring their suppliers in China to adopt best environmental practices. Western governments can also help by explaining how pollution could threaten both China's growth and social stability -- the two things its authoritarian leaders worry about most. 
 Perhaps the most important thing the United States could do is to set a strong international example, by dealing with its own environmental deficit. Instead, the Bush administration has been hiding behind China's recalcitrance -- allowing China to do the same.

HEADLINE: Monks' Protest Is Challenging Burmese Junta

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Monday, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
The largest street protests in two decades against Myanmar's military rulers gained momentum Sunday as thousands of onlookers cheered huge columns of Buddhist monks and shouted support for the detained pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. 
 Winding for a sixth day through rainy streets, the protest swelled to 10,000 monks in the main city of Yangon, formerly Rangoon, according to witnesses and other accounts relayed from the closed country, including some clandestinely shot videos.
 It came one day after a group of several hundred monks paid respects to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi at the gate of her home, the first time she has been seen in public in more than four years. 
 The link between the clergy and the leader of the country's pro-democracy movement, the beginnings of large-scale public participation in the marches and a call by some monks for a wider protest raised the stakes for the government. 
 So far, it has mostly allowed the monks free reign in the streets, apparently fearing a public backlash if it cracks down on them in this Buddhist nation. 
 Monks were reported to be parading through a number of cities on Sunday, notably the country's second largest city, Mandalay, where an estimated 10,000 people, including 4,000 monks, had marched Saturday.
 Myanmar's military government has sealed off the country to foreign journalists but information about the protests has been increasingly flowing out through wire service reports, exile groups in Thailand with contacts inside Myanmar, and through the photographs, videos and audio files, carried rapidly by technologies, including the Internet, that the government has failed to squelch. 
 The state-controlled press has carried no reports about the monks' demonstrations. 
 Since the military crushed a peaceful nationwide uprising in 1988, killing an estimated 3,000 civilians, the country, formerly known as Burma, has sunk further into poverty and repression and become a symbol for the outside world of the harsh military subjugation of a people. 
 Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, has been locked inside her home for 12 of the last 18 years, and the government has arrested thousands of political prisoners. 
 The United States and Europe have led a tightening economic boycott that has been undermined by trade and assistance from Myanmar's neighbors, mainly China but also India and some Southeast Asian nations. The United States has diplomatic relations with Myanmar but no ambassador. President Bush, his wife, Laura, and a roster of Hollywood celebrities have spoken out recently about Myanmar, and the abuses of human and political rights by the military junta are expected to take a high profile at the United Nations session starting this week.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, asked about Myanmar as she arrived at the United Nations on Sunday, told reporters that the Bush administration was closely monitoring how the government deals with the protests. 
 ''The Burmese people deserve better,'' she said. ''They deserve a life to be able to live in freedom, just as everyone does. And the brutality of this regime is well known, and so we will be speaking about that and I think the president will be speaking about it with many of his colleagues.'' 
 The public display of discontent in Myanmar mirrors that of the previous uprising -- anger over a brutal and incompetent military government that has turned one of Southeast Asia's best endowed and most sophisticated nations into one of its most repressed and destitute.
 Surreptitiously shot photographs and videos recorded on Sunday showed thousands of civilians marching quickly through the streets side by side with the monks, emboldened by the continuing demonstrations into a rare show of defiance. 
 Some pictures showed people joining hands in a protective cordon as they walked beside the monks in their dark red robes. Others showed Buddhist nuns with shaved heads marching through the streets as onlookers applauded. 
 In audio recordings people shouted ''Do-aye'' -- ''It is our task'' -- a slogan of determination that was also heard on the streets in 1988. 
 The photographs and videos themselves represented acts of courage in a closed and repressive country that has tried to quash the spread of information.
 But modern communications technology has brought the protests into the world's eye in a way that was not possible in 1988. 
 Both the government and protesters have so far sought to avoid the kind of confrontation that led to widespread bloodshed in the 1988 uprising, which was led mostly by students. 
 ''The monks are the highest moral authority in the Burmese culture,'' said Soe Aung, a spokesman for a coalition of exile groups based in Thailand. ''If something happens to the monks, the situation will spread much faster than what happened to the students in 1988.'' 
 This gingerly approach by authorities -- and the challenges it poses -- were demonstrated on Saturday when guards removed barriers to allow about 500 monks to walk down the tree shaded street where Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi lives. 
 She met them at the iron gate outside her home and witnesses told wire services that she was in tears as she greeted the monks, who chanted prayers as they faced the security officers with riot shields who sealed off her home. 
 On Sunday, witness accounts relayed by exile groups reported that members of the public shouted their support for her and that some of the protesting monks also shouted, ''Release Suu Kyi!'' 
 Uniformed police officers and soldiers have stayed in the background throughout a month of building protests. But witnesses said plainclothes police officers trailed the marchers and some, armed with shotguns, were posted along the route. 
 The Associated Press reported that police officers turned back a small group of monks who tried to march for a second day to the home of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi. 
 Although she has been sealed off from the public and has been allowed almost no visitors, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 62, remains a martyr and rallying symbol for the population. 
 ''She has been out of contact with virtually everyone, but her symbolic importance cannot be underestimated,'' said Basil Fernando, director of the Asian Human Rights Commission. ''Symbolically, her reintroduction into the political life of the country at such a dire moment is of enormous importance.'' 
 The daughter of an assassinated independence hero, Aung San, she came to prominence when she became a leader in the pro-democracy demonstrations of 1988. 
 Her political party, the National League for Democracy, won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections in 1990, although the junta, fearing her charismatic appeal, had already placed her under house arrest. 
 The military government annulled the election results and held on to power. But it miscalculated the public mood again in 2002 when it released her from house arrest and allowed her to tour the country, visiting party offices.
 She drew increasingly large and enthusiastic crowds until a band of government-backed thugs attacked a convoy in which she was traveling, killing several people. The government seized her again and placed under even stricter house arrest, cutting off her telephone and deepening her isolation. 
 The latest protests began Aug. 19 in response to sharp, unannounced fuel price increases of up to 500 percent, immediately raising the prices of goods and transportation. 
 They were led at first by former student protesters and other activists, but most of the leaders had been arrested or were in hiding when the monks began their protests last Tuesday. 
 The monks were apparently motivated at first by an attack on a small demonstration at which security officers fired shots into the air and beat a number of monks. 
 Since then, the monks' protests have spread from city to city and have become more overtly political. 
 On Saturday, an organization of clergy called the All Burma Monks Alliance, called for a widening of the protests in a statement that said, ''In order to banish the common enemy evil regime from Burmese soil forever, united masses of people need to join hands with the united clergy forces.'' 
 It went on, ''We pronounce the evil military despotism, which is impoverishing and pauperizing our people of all walks, including the clergy, as the common enemy of all our citizens.''

HEADLINE: Suicide Bomb Kills 16 at a Friendship Banquet in Iraq

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER; Ali Hamdani, Mudhafer al-Husaini and Khalid al-Ansary contributed reporting from Baghdad, and Iraqi employees of The New York Times from Baquba and Sulaimaniya.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
A suicide bomber blew himself up on Monday at a banquet intended to be a reconciliation feast between provincial officials and former Sunni insurgents in Diyala Province, killing 16 people and wounding at least 28.
 Among the wounded were the provincial governor, the regional police chief and the local military commander, local police officials said. At least one former insurgent leader was killed, they said.
 The gathering was of the type that is a cornerstone of American plans to reconcile former insurgents with the Iraqi government and enlist their help in fighting Sunni extremist groups. The strategy has produced security gains in Sunni areas in western Iraq, and the military is trying to repeat that success in places like Diyala, a mixed area of Sunnis and Shiites north of Baghdad. 
 The American military confirmed that American officers had attended the meeting, held at a Shiite mosque in an outlying district of Baquba, the provincial capital. It said soldiers had been attacked by a suicide bomber, but said nothing about any wounded or dead among the Americans. 
 ''There are an unknown number of casualties, and the incident remains under investigation,'' the military statement said.
 The bombing was the second this month aimed at leaders of the so-called Sunni awakening. On Sept. 13, a suicide bomber killed Abdul Sattar Buzaigh al-Rishawi, known as Abu Risha, the Sunni tribal leader who unified several tribes to fight Sunni extremists in Anbar Province, in western Iraq. He died 10 days after meeting with President Bush at a military base in Anbar. 
 The reconciliation banquet on Monday was held to break the daily fast during the holy month of Ramadan. The suicide bomber detonated himself at the entrance to the mosque, where he was stopped by guards as the group was having tea in the yard. 
 ''I saw a young man in his 30s running toward the front gate of the mosque,'' a police officer said in a telephone interview. ''He wanted to reach the governor, but the guards stopped him. He immediately exploded himself.''
 Another police officer at the site said: ''The explosion was huge. It says that Al Qaeda is still alive in Baquba.'' He was referring to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a homegrown jihadist group that American intelligence agencies believe is foreign-led.
 Among the dead was Hajji Najim, a former leader of the 1920s Revolutionary Brigade, an insurgent group named after an uprising in that era against the British occupation of Iraq. It is one of the Sunni extremist groups that had battled American forces but appear to have stopped.
 Diyala Province is strategically important for the United States because it is a transit point for Sunni extremists moving from predominantly Sunni regions in northwestern Iraq into Baghdad. Violence has surged again in the area after a brief hiatus during an American offensive in July.
 Also on Monday, Iran sealed border crossings into the Kurdish region of northern Iraq to protest the arrest of an Iranian man on suspicion of smuggling powerful roadside bombs.
 On Thursday the American military had arrested the man, Agai Mahummdi Firhadi, in northern Iraq, saying he was suspected of smuggling weapons into Iraq for use against American troops. The United States says Mr. Firhadi is an officer in Iran's elite Quds Force. 
 Iraq's president, Jalal Talabani, expressed anger at Mr. Firhadi's arrest, saying he was an Iranian diplomat.
 The border closure was the latest sign of tensions being played out between Iran and the United States in the mountainous regions of northern Iraq. If it persists, it could damage Iraqi Kurdistan's economy, officials said. By evening, scores of trucks were backed up along both sides of the border; officials in the Kurdish region said 300 trucks crossed the border daily.
 Hasan Baqi, the head of the chamber of commerce in Sulaimaniya in the Kurdish zone, estimated that 30,000 people in the Kurdish areas relied on trade with Iran for jobs. 
 Iran is also angered that the Kurds tacitly allow bases in their territory for an Iranian Kurdish separatist movement known as the Pejak, which Tehran says has staged incursions into Iran. Iranian officials say it is supported by the United States; the Pentagon has denied supporting the group.
 The American military also said Monday that soldiers attacked an insurgent cell in eastern Baghdad that it said was backed by Iran. One person was killed, and four were wounded. Militants placed roadside bombs along the soldiers' exit route, the military said, adding that one bomb was a shaped charge of the type the United States has accused Iranian agents of smuggling into Iraq. It was impossible to verify the military's claim.

 It's true that astronauts drank Tang, the orange-flavored breakfast drink developed by General Foods, in orbit; that Teflon is, in fact, a component of spacesuits and heat shields; and that Velcro is a handy way of keeping things from floating away in zero gravity. But all three products were invented for earthbound use long before NASA sent them into space. 
 So to what extent has the space program transformed modern life and contributed to America's prosperity? 
 Experts note some fundamental contributions. The satellites that began beaming television signals instantaneously around the globe, peering intently at developing hurricanes and studying the planet's changing climate.
 ''Your life would be fundamentally different if we didn't have those things,'' said Roger D. Launius, a space historian at the Smithsonian Institution.
 Other spinoffs are harder to identify, and their economic effects are debatable. 
 Magnetic resonance imaging machines were not invented by NASA, but software algorithms written to sharpen the images sent back from the Moon were used by Landsat satellites for pictures of Earth and then adapted by medical researchers to produce clearer M.R.I. images. 
 Various studies have said that what NASA spends on the space program -- in 2007, its budget was $16.8 billion, about 15 cents a day for each American or 0.7 percent of the overall federal budget -- is at least tripled in returns to the economy. 
 Doubters might argue that something like the image-processing algorithms used in M.R.I.'s would have been written anyway, even without NASA's help.
 Mr. Launius said spinoffs should not be viewed as a primary justification for the space program. 
 ''Spinoffs are serendipity to the mission that NASA is seeking to accomplish,'' he said. ''Trying to justify the program on the basis of serendipity is, I think, kind of misplaced.''
 In a speech this year, Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, made a similar argument, adding that the grocery and hardware stores are the wrong places to look for space spinoffs, anyway. 
 ''The real spinoffs are at a higher level,'' Mr. Griffin said. 
 Any company that seeks to build a rocket or satellite component ''or who even wants to supply nuts, bots and screws to the space industry,'' he said, ''must work to a higher level of precision than human beings had to do before the space industry came along. 
 ''And that fact absolutely resonates through our entire industrial base. What is the value of that? I can't calculate it, but I know it's there.''

GRAPHIC: Satellites wobble, so the video they take can be jittery. NASA scientists wrote software to bring out the details. That software helped the F.B.I. investigate the 1996 Olympic bombing in Atlanta by clarifying nighttime video taken by a bystander. The multitude of satellites -- observing weather, conveying television, sending global positioning signals -- are the most direct influence of space technology on everyday life. But other space spinoffs have also found practical uses on Earth. At the Kennedy Space Center, the humid, salty air of the Florida coast corrodes the launching pads, so NASA developed a protective coating. That same material was applied to the interior framework of the Statue of Liberty during its renovation. Developed to simulate microgravity conditions, the bioreactor cultivates cells and may enable the growing of tissues and organs for transplants. For many biologists, the bioreactor may replace the venerable Petri dish.

HEADLINE: New Horizons Beckon, Inspiring Vision if Not Certainty

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Fifty years of spaceflight have taken people to the Moon and have sent unmanned vehicles zipping to the fringes of the solar system. What could the next 50 years bring? 
 Much more, or potentially not much more. Government-financed space travel could stall in the face of America's growing aversion to risk and a kind of orbital ennui. NASA has, after all, already tried for more than a decade to develop follow-on vehicles to the flawed space shuttle and is in the process of trying again. 
 Private enterprise is stepping up, but the industry is still fragile.
 Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, said in an interview that he was confident of one thing for the foreseeable future: ''We're going to have a space program.'' 
 Beyond that, all bets are off. 
 ''The one thing of which we can be certain,'' Mr. Griffin wrote in a recent essay on the Web site of the magazine Aviation Week and Space Technology, ''is that in trying to envision the world of 2057, two generations in the future, we will be wrong.''
 Experts in government, industry and science agree, however, that these three broad trends will shape the coming decades in space:
 NASA has embarked on a program to return to the Moon by 2020, not just for what some critics call ''flags and footprints,'' but also for a lasting presence with scientific research and preparation for expeditions to asteroids and, eventually, Mars. The space shuttle program is being wound down by 2010 to create the next generation of vehicles. 
 Other nations, notably Russia and China, have ambitious plans and could spur a space race like the one that sent Americans to the Moon. ''It took Sputnik for us to recognize what the Soviet Union was up to,'' said Harrison H. Schmitt, who flew the last mission to the Moon, in 1972. ''I don't know what it will take this time.''
 Private enterprise is moving ahead, beginning with space tourism and, later, transport services for NASA and other governments to outposts like the International Space Station. Beyond that, ventures could include mining on asteroids and manufacturing drugs in space. 
 John M. Logsdon, director of the space policy institute at George Washington University, says a big question has yet to be answered. 
 ''At the level of government, I think we're still struggling as to why we're sending people to space,'' Dr. Logsdon said. ''It's a decent question, and I think it's an unanswered question.'' 
 That leaves the manned space program at a precarious point, he said, adding: ''If the current proposals to restart human exploration fail politically, indeed, the human space flight endeavor conducted under government auspices might well lose its momentum. I obviously hope that doesn't happen. But it's far from a slam dunk that we're going back to the Moon and on to Mars.''
 Entrepreneurs say they have the answer -- money. Peter Diamandis, a founder of the Ansari X Prize, the $10 million competition to put a pilot in space without government financing, said that with all the energy and minerals to be found there ''the first trillionaires are going to be made in space.'' 
 In the next 50 years, Mr. Diamandis said, ''economic engines,'' not political ones, will push the space frontier.
 Dr. Logsdon is skeptical. ''There are a variety of alluring prospects that have been around almost since the start of the last 50 years that are still there as alluring prospects,'' he said. ''And we are not further along in knowing whether they can be turned into reality or not.'' The continued reliance on chemical rockets, for example, limits the weight that can be taken into space.
 Yet much has changed in the last 50 years that could lay the foundation for the next 50. A new generation of ultrawealthy entrepreneurs who grew up with a space fascination are pouring personal fortunes into making space businesses real. 
 Paul G. Allen, a founder of Microsoft, paid for SpaceShipOne, the tiny craft that won the X Prize in 2004. Elon Musk, a founder of PayPal, is developing rockets through his company, Space Exploration Technologies, and has NASA financing that could lead to his spacecraft's carrying people and supplies to the International Space Station. 
 Jeffrey P. Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, is developing rockets at a site he owns in western Texas. 
 Robert Bigelow, who made his fortune in hotels, is developing a space transportation system and a space station that could be used as an orbiting hotel or a research base.
 The official charged with regulating commercial spaceflight, Patricia Grace Smith of the Federal Aviation Administration, said in an interview, ''When I look out 50 years from now, I fully expect that we will have actual, operational spaceports'' that are commercially operated and owned. 
 At the dusty, sprawling Mojave Air and Space Port in California, dreamers and pragmatists join in planning the future. 
 Jeff Greason, the founder of Xcor Aerospace, one of several rocket companies there, said his industry was ready to talk big again after years of having to shake off the pixie dust of science fiction. ''We had to stop focusing on the grand and glorious future,'' he said, ''because otherwise, people weren't going to take us seriously as a business. We very consciously turned the vision thing off.'' 
 ''We're making progress on real businesses that turn profits,'' he added.
 Other companies are already in the game. Mr. Greason's neighbor, Scaled Composites, is working on a successor vehicle to its SpaceShipOne. 
 Richard Branson's company, Virgin Galactic, which will buy the vehicles, has a long list of potential space tourists. 
 Esther Dyson, a longtime technology guru who is encouraging investment in space, said the development of rocket businesses paralleled the early days of personal computing and the Internet. Early government financing created technologies whose use was largely limited to government and academia.
 ''So eventually these commercial types came in, and suddenly a whole lot of revenue came in,'' she said. ''It benefited the research types, as well as the commercial types. And it created an infrastructure for the public.'' 
 That led, in turn, to today's Google, Netscape, Google Earth, ''all these wonderful things we take for granted.''
 Mr. Greason predicts that government will take the lead in long-range exploration, but that industry will take up the slack closer to home. Just as the military relies on private air carriers, he said, ''the government efforts will become customers of the private efforts.''
 NASA will meanwhile be trying to extend the reach of humanity. Mr. Griffin, its administrator, laid out a rough timetable for the goals that President Bush set in 2004. 
 He sees the mileposts clearly along the way, returning to the Moon by 2020, with a ''small lunar outpost'' a few years later, on the way to ''towns on the Moon.'' The first flights to Mars could occur in the next decade, he said, so that by the 100th anniversary of spaceflight in 2057, ''we can be looking back at the 20th anniversary of the first human landing on Mars.''
 If the United States wants to lead the way, he said, the clock is ticking.
 ''This is the last generation of Americans which is going to have the unquestioned opportunity to lead that enterprise,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''Because in the next generation we are going to find, at least, Russia, China, India and Europe fully as capable as we are. It will be a matter of interest and politics and societal will or desire. But it will not be a matter of capability.'' 
 Whoever takes them on, the challenges will be greater than any that spacefaring nations have yet faced. They involve radiation levels that science does not yet know how to protect against and problems like reduced gravity and Moon dust, which is ultrafine-grained, chemically reactive and highly abrasive, all of which may mean serious health problems for astronauts.
 At a conference in June on lunar settlements, Dr. James S. Logan, a former chief of medical operations at the Johnson Space Center and a founder of Space Medicine Associates, a medical consulting group, pointed out that the previous missions to the Moon involved just 600 total man-hours on the surface, a figure likely to be exceeded on the first return mission. 
 In his presentation, Dr. Logan pointed out that the earlier exposure times, ''while significant,'' did not provide strong evidence that long-duration exposure would be safe.
 At a conference on space medicine this year at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, Peggy A. Whitson, an astronaut who is about to take her second stint aboard the International Space Station, said radiation would continue to be a concern. 
 ''We have to just accept the fact that if we're going to explore,'' Dr. Whitson said, ''we're going to have to accept a higher level of radiation'' than, say, OSHA permits for atomic workers. 
 Dr. Jonathan Clark, a former NASA flight surgeon on the panel with Dr. Whitson, said, ''To me, an unacceptable level of risk would be a radiation exposure that would result in acute and substantial performance effects, either fatality or cognitive decline.'' 
 If the effects are so debilitating that the mission fails, Dr. Clark said, ''it's pointless to go.''
 There could be other problems with a Mars mission that scientists are just beginning to explore. At the Rice conference, Dr. Nick Kanas of the University of California, San Francisco, a psychiatrist who has studied astronauts, described what he called the ''Earth out of view'' phenomenon. 
 Dr. Kanas's research has found that one of the most positive parts of going to space is seeing the Earth. But on a trip to Mars, the Earth would dwindle to a bluish speck. 
 ''No one in the history of humans has ever studied what it's like to see the Earth as a little dot,'' he said. 
 In an interview, Dr. Kanas said losing the visual connection with the home planet could be a ''unique stressor.'' 
 Communications would slow markedly, with lags of more than 40 minutes, he said. Ready access to powerful telescopes and libraries of Earth images might help, but it would be important to fight those feelings of ''extreme isolation and loneliness.''
 Mr. Griffin acknowledged that problems like radiation presented grave challenges in each new environment, but added that he was confident that protections would be discovered, just as early sailors learned that sauerkraut and lemons could protect them from scurvy on long voyages. 
 And he predicted that the lessons learned about bone growth, cell biology, damage prevention and repair would help treat diseases on Earth.
 Mr. Schmitt, the Apollo astronaut, agreed. Despite very real risks of living in space and on other planets, he said, ''I don't see any showstoppers.''
 Stuart Witt, general manager of the Mojave Air and Space Port, takes an even longer view. In his office, with composite craft being designed in nearby buildings, Mr. Witt noted that five centuries ago, Magellan left Spain with five ships and 270 men. Two years later, one ship returned, with 18 men. 
 He quoted from memory a passage from Charles Van Doren's book ''A History of Knowledge: Past, Present, and Future'' (1991), pointing out that after the surviving ship returned loaded with valuable spices, subsequent expeditions ''never lacked for sailors to man them and for captains to lead them.''
 ''They knew that the spirit of exploration was far bigger than any individual,'' Mr. Witt said.
 The argument resonates with Mr. Griffin: ''Every time that humans have invested in the past in breaking through new frontiers, it's been to our profit.
 ''It may be tough on the individual explorers, but it's been pretty beneficial for the human race -- as we sit here,'' he continued, waving his arms to take in his office, Washington and America, ''in what once was the New World.''
 ''We'll lose people,'' he said flatly, and risks must be minimized. But exploring is ''embedded in our DNA.'' 
 The urge to go beyond might actually be ingrained in the helical curves of our genes as one of the many behavioral traits now being linked to genetic propensities, said Jeffrey M. Friedman, director of the Starr Center for Human Genetics at the Rockefeller University.
 Indulging in a bit of speculation at a reporter's request, Dr. Friedman said ''it's very plausible to suggest'' that there might be a primal urge to explore and take risks.
 ''And you sort of have direct evidence of it in the history of human migrations,'' he added. 
 In any population, there would be a spectrum of traits from stay-at-homes to explorers, with those at either end of the spectrum prospering in some circumstances and suffering in others. 
 The future holds promise and peril, as any visitor to Mojave can see. At Scaled Composites, an explosion last month killed three employees. The accident involved the nitrous oxide that Scaled Composites uses as a propellant, though there was no rocket test at the time. The accident is under investigation. 
 Meanwhile, the company continues to develop its next craft, and Virgin Galactic said no customers had canceled. When asked whether the accident gave him second thoughts, James Lovelock, the 88-year-old British scientist and author, said, ''I have no qualms whatever.''

HEADLINE: With Fear and Wonder in Its Wake, Sputnik Lifted Us Into the Future

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
Fifty years ago, before most people living today were born, the beep-beep-beep of Sputnik was heard round the world. It was the sound of wonder and foreboding. Nothing would ever be quite the same again -- in geopolitics, in science and technology, in everyday life and the capacity of the human species.
 The Soviet Union had launched the first artificial satellite, a new moon, on Oct. 4, 1957. Climbing out of the terrestrial gravity well, rising above the atmosphere and into orbit, Sputnik crossed the threshold into a new dimension of human experience. People could now see their kind as spacefarers. Their enhanced mobility might someday prove as liberating as the first upright steps of hominid ancestors long ago.
 The immediate reaction, though, reflected the dark concerns of a world in the grip of the cold war, a time of fear and division in which the two superpowers, the Soviet Union and the United States, stared each other down with the menace of mass destruction. Sputnik altered the nature and scope of the cold war. 
 It was an unprepossessing agent of alarm. A simple sphere weighing just 184 pounds and not quite two feet wide, it had a highly polished surface of aluminum, the better to reflect sunlight and be visible from Earth. Two radio transmitters with whiskery antennas issued steady signals on frequencies that scientists and ham operators could pick up, and so confirm the achievement.
 The Russians clearly intended Sputnik as a ringing statement of their technological prowess and its military implications. But even they, it seems, had not foreseen the frenzied response their success provoked.
 When the Soviet dictator Nikita S. Khrushchev received word of the launching, he was of course pleased, and he and his son, Sergei, turned on the radio to listen to the beeping Sputnik. They went to bed, the son remembers, without realizing ''the immensity of what was happening during those hours.''
 The Soviet press published a standard two-column report of the event, with a minimum of gloating. But newspapers in the West, particularly the United States, filled pages with news and analysis.
 Sputnik's signal reverberated through chambers of the powerful and down ordinary streets. People listened and, from rooftops and backyards, saw in the night a moving point of light, like an errant star. The interrogatory of invention used to be ''What hath God wrought?'' Now it was ''What are the Russians capable of next?''
 ''No event since Pearl Harbor set off such repercussions in public life,'' Walter A. McDougall, a historian at the University of Pennsylvania, has written. A younger generation may draw comparison with the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.
 Sputnik plunged Americans into a crisis of self-confidence. Had the country grown lax with prosperity? Was the education system inadequate, especially in training scientists and engineers? Were the institutions of liberal democracy any match in competition with an authoritarian communist society?
 In ''The Heavens and the Earth: A Political History of the Space Age'' (1985), Dr. McDougall wrote that before Sputnik the cold war had been ''a military and political struggle in which the United States need only lend aid and comfort to its allies in the front lines.'' Now, he continued, the cold war ''became total, a competition for the loyalty and trust of all peoples fought out in all arenas of social achievement, in which science textbooks and racial harmony were as much tools of foreign policy as missiles and spies.''
 At the time of Sputnik, John F. Kennedy was the junior senator from Massachusetts with no particular interest in space. Yuri A. Gagarin was an unheralded Russian military pilot. John H. Glenn Jr. was a Marine Corps pilot who had recently set a record for the fastest transcontinental jet flight to New York from Los Angeles. Neil A. Armstrong was testing high-performance aircraft in the California desert. Their lives were soon to be changed, as were those of hundreds of thousands of engineers, technicians, other workers and ordinary people everywhere.
 Thomas J. O'Malley, an aviation engineer in New Jersey, would move in a few months to a forlorn spit of land at Cape Canaveral, Fla., to be a test conductor in the accelerated development of the Atlas missile, which would eventually lift American astronauts into orbit. ''We had one goal,'' he recalled recently. ''To get something up there as quickly as possible.'' 
 Christopher C. Kraft Jr. soon found himself working with a task force planning an American response to the challenge. He would become the first flight director of astronaut missions, but at the start, he has written, the morale of American engineers was low. ''I wasn't the only engineer who was stunned at how much I didn't know and how much I had to learn,'' he said.
 When the Sputnik news reached Huntsville, Ala., Wernher von Braun was beside himself with restless frustration. Mr. von Braun, a German-born rocket scientist working for the United States Army, said this country could have beaten the Russians into orbit if not for Pentagon orders to resist any thought of adding a small satellite to the Jupiter-C missile he had been testing.
 To make matters worse, the first American attempts to launch a tiny Vanguard satellite were embarrassing failures. It was the end of January 1958 before Americans succeeded with Explorer 1, boosted into orbit by a multistage version of Mr. von Braun's Jupiter-C. But the much larger Sputnik 2 had already carried the dog Laika into orbit, a harbinger of human spaceflight. The original Sputnik -- in Russian, ''satellite'' or ''fellow traveler'' -- was no onetime fluke.
 The post-Sputnik dynamic even reached out and recruited me. I was then a soldier in the cold war. Along with nearly every able-bodied young American man (even Elvis had to put in his two years), I was fulfilling my obligation to interrupt life and career for military service. I had completed college and was a reporter on military leave of absence from The Wall Street Journal, at the Army base in Fort Dix, N.J. 
 The morning after the Soviet triumph, I was on a one-day pass in Trenton. I bought the papers and spread them out on a coffee shop table. Banner headlines trumpeted the news. The recondite language of rocketry and orbits tied up my head, but I read on. I gave a passing thought to the coincidence of Sputnik's going up on my birthday; at least I should never forget the date the space age began.
 My story should at this point resound with destiny's thunderclap or a sudden gust swinging open the door, scattering the papers and leaving me strangely moved. But I had no premonition that Sputnik had set in motion events that would shape my career. It was not until 1959, soon after I returned to The Journal from service in West Germany, that I felt the Sputnik effect.
 Newspapers and other media, influenced by Sputnik, were scrambling to expand coverage of science, medicine and technology. I agreed to the managing editor's suggestion that I try my hand writing about medicine. One thing led to another, from medicine to science and space exploration, to Time magazine and eventually to the staff of The New York Times to cover the most ambitious American response to Sputnik: the Apollo program.
 Sputnik should not have come as such a surprise. Both the Soviet Union and the United States had embarked on the development of ballistic missiles for carrying nuclear warheads to great distances. They had also announced plans to launch artificial satellites in the International Geophysical Year, a cooperative 18-month scientific undertaking to study Earth and its atmosphere, beginning in 1957. Khrushchev had reiterated Soviet intentions only two months before.
 But a shock it was, a wake-up call. One of the intriguing might-have-beens of history is: What if Americans had deployed the first satellite?
 Alex Roland, a historian of technology at Duke University and a former NASA historian, said that a first launching by Americans would have merely confirmed their reputation for technological superiority. The costly rivalry for dominance in space, he said, would have probably been waged with much less driving urgency.
 John M. Logsdon, director of the Institute of Space Policy at George Washington University, agreed. ''If not for Sputnik,'' he said, ''there would probably not have been Apollo.''
 But after Sputnik, there was no stopping the momentum of the space race. Critics attacked the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who at first had dismissed Sputnik as an event of only ''scientific interest.'' Soon the Defense Department stepped up missile development. The Democratic Congress established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
 The perception of a threatening Soviet advantage in missiles persisted. Necessity had dictated the Russian concentration on missiles. Ever since World War II, American bombers had been more capable than those of the Russians, who also had no air bases in striking distance of their adversary's heartland, in contrast to the American bases that ringed the Soviet Union.
 An exaggerated estimate of the ''missile gap'' became a rallying cry of the 1960 presidential campaign and may have been crucial in Kennedy's narrow victory. Not long after he took office, the Russians scored another stunning triumph. In April 1961, Gagarin became the first human to fly in Earth orbit.
 After weeks of closed-door consultations, Kennedy went before Congress, on May 25, and declared, ''Now it is time to take longer strides -- time for a great new American enterprise -- time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement which, in many ways, may hold the key to our future on Earth.''
 He committed the country to ''the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth.''
 How brief the space race was, the 12 years from the wake-up call to the first walk on the Moon, but thrilling, mind-boggling, even magnificent at times.
 While the Russians forge ahead, Americans begin catching up with the Mercury and Gemini flights in orbit. As the goal comes into sight, there are the countdowns of tingling anticipation. In the dark before dawn, we drive toward the shining light enveloping a spaceship that looks like an obelisk out of antiquity, waiting to be launched. The blast of the Saturn 5, just three miles of sand and scrub away, beats on your chest and shakes the ground you stand on. Once at full thrust, and unbound, the huge rocket at first appears to be losing its fight against gravity, then slowly rises to the occasion and is off over the ocean, fire and vapor trailing behind. Spacefarers are on their way to the Moon.
 Three lunar voyages are most sharply etched in memory. The Apollo 8 astronauts, in December 1968, are the first to reach the Moon, circling it 10 times. Out their windows they see the achingly beautiful Earth, blue and green under swirls of white clouds. On Christmas Eve, the men take turns reading verses from Genesis. It is a gift from on high at a time of turmoil and despair in the year of assassinations, rioting cities and a divisive war.
 Then there is Apollo 11. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong steps down the landing craft's ladder and takes ''one giant leap for mankind.'' Buzz Aldrin joins him for the first walk on the Moon. In contrast to exploration's previous landfalls, the whole world is watching on television.
 In the current documentary film ''In the Shadow of the Moon,'' Michael Collins, the Apollo 11 pilot who remained in lunar orbit during the landing, recalls that on the crew's world tour afterward, people they met felt they had participated in the landing, too. ''People, instead of saying, 'Well, you Americans did it!' '' he said, ''everywhere, they said, 'We did it!' We, humankind, we, the human race, we, people, did it!'''
 The warmth of shared experience was remarkable, given the origins of the space race in an atmosphere of fear and belligerence.
 Apollo 11 essentially ended the space race, and public interest in spaceflight was flagging by the time of Apollo 13, in April 1970. The residual self-assurance that committed the country to Apollo in 1961 had given way to self-doubt. The war in Vietnam, another chapter in the cold war, shoved Apollo to the periphery of the national mind.
 Apollo 13 is the mission that failed, but a drama of epic dimensions worthy of Homer. Three astronauts go forth on a daring quest, meet with disaster, face death and barely limp back to the safety of home. If anything, this brush with death put a more human face on spaceflight and made it seem more exciting, and dangerous.
 By the end of 1972, the last of the 12 men to walk on the Moon packed up and returned home, and no one has been there since. At the conclusion of that flight, Apollo 17, I solicited historians' assessments of the significance of these early years in space. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. predicted that in 500 years, the 20th century would probably be remembered mainly for humanity's first ventures beyond its native planet. At the close of the century, he had not changed his mind.
 In succeeding years, the Russians and Americans continued spaceflights, at a reduced pace. Most American money went into the space shuttles, the reusable vehicles confined to orbit that never lived up to their promise to make human flight more routine. The public's most lasting images of the program are the Challenger's deadly explosion shortly after liftoff in 1986, and the Columbia's disintegration on re-entry 17 years later.
 It was left to the relatively low-budget robotic spacecraft to sustain the impression of exploration and discovery on this new frontier. In that respect, they alone exceeded early promises. Russian and American craft explored Venus. American vehicles landed several times on Mars, and a European capsule reached the surface of Saturn's moon Titan. Two Voyager craft made a grand tour of the four giant outer planets and are now approaching the edge of the solar system. The Hubble Space Telescope still sends images from deep in cosmic time.
 Carl Sagan, the astronomer and author, often spoke of this as the golden age of planetary exploration. ''In all the history of mankind,'' he wrote, ''there will be only one generation that will be first to explore the solar system, one generation for which, in childhood, the planets are distant and indistinct disks moving through the night sky, and for which, in old age, the planets are places, diverse new worlds in the course of exploration.''
 One evening in 1990, I drove across Baltimore on a sentimental journey. Every so often since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the reunification of Germany, the collapse of communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the last gasps coming out of the exhausted Soviet Union itself, I had allowed myself reflections on my two years as a soldier in an unconventional war and the nearly half-century of anxieties of living in a world primed to blow itself up.
 I could hardly think of myself outside the context of the cold war. Without the intense Soviet-American competition epitomized by the space race, I would not have become a science journalist who wrote about astronauts going to the Moon to ''beat'' the Russians. I would therefore not be in Baltimore again, this time with astronomers who were preparing to look into the heavens via a giant orbiting telescope.
 I found my way to Travelers Lounge, the bar that had been across from the gate to the Army Intelligence School at Fort Holabird. We used to tarry in the back room there, over pitchers of beer fueling arguments about politics and the American novel. I took a stool and told the bartender that it had been more than three decades since I last had a beer here, back in my Holabird sojourn.
 ''One of them comes in every few months and looks around,'' the bartender said. ''We're about the only thing left from those days.''
 So I had seen. The fort was gone. In its place stretched one corporate complex after another, buildings of glass and steel and spreading car parks. The names I saw were as unfamiliar as their digitized new-technology goods and services. I imagined I was looking on a monument to the cold war, and how apt it seemed.
 The conflict we had lived through did not lend itself to heroic and triumphal iconography, nothing like the Iwo Jima flag-raising statue, nothing to glorify war or proclaim victory. So these commercial enterprises rising from cold-war technology, supplanting an old fort, were working monuments to the end of the cold war, monuments that do not look back.
 At least Travelers and I had made it through this passage in history. Over my shoulder, I saw families and couples dining, not a beer pitcher or soldier anywhere. I wondered what post-cold-war memories these diners would bring back there in coming years.
 I took my leave of Travelers and an era. I had to be fresh in the morning for another meeting with people at the Space Telescope Science Institute. They were tending their own monument to the cold war, which had fostered the Hubble Space Telescope's technology. I wanted to learn more of our -- and my own -- expanding universe.
 Over a long dinner, after the cold war and almost 30 years since the first lunar landing, a former astronaut who walked on the Moon and one of the Apollo flight directors got to skylarking about the good old days, something people do when they think of their past receding and the world changing all around. They laughed almost to tears telling cherished stories, one trying to top the other.
 Then a cloud seemed to pass over their faces. Pete Conrad, the astronaut, who would soon die in a motorcycle accident, and Gerald D. Griffin, the flight director, wondered in perplexity what had happened to their good old days. What of those grand prospects of a few decades ago? No humans have flown to Mars, as once predicted, or established a permanent base on the Moon. A long-sought orbiting space station was finally being assembled in orbit, but no one seemed sure what it was good for, except as a demonstration of cooperation by many nations, including Russia, in a major space endeavor.
 Economics and shifting national priorities had thwarted the most ambitious post-Apollo plans.
 Dr. Logsdon of George Washington University called Apollo ''a product of a specific time in history,'' and a singular crash program responding to a perceived threat to the country. It did not represent a firm commitment by society to full-scale space exploration.
 As Dr. Roland of Duke pointed out, Apollo ''did just what it was designed to do, which was to convince the world and ourselves that we were masters of technology, and it wasn't designed to do anything else.'' As yet, he said, ''we have not identified a mission for astronauts that was commensurate with Apollo.''
 Dr. Roland noted that telecommunications was the only space enterprise that pays for itself and, he added, ''It has transformed the world.'' All other space activities, military and civilian, depend so far on ''what states believe are in their best interest to invest in'' -- and those interests have changed since the cold war.
 Let Neil Armstrong, known as a man of few words, have the last word.
 ''I think we'll always be in space,'' he said in an interview for NASA's oral history program. ''But it will take us longer to do the new things than the advocates would like, and in some cases it will take external factors or forces which we can't control and can't anticipate that will cause things to happen or not happen.''
 Mr. Armstrong then struck a note sure to resonate with many of his contemporaries. ''We were really very privileged,'' he said, ''to live in that thin slice of history where we changed how man looks at himself and what he might become and where he might go.''

HEADLINE: Burmese Junta Warns Monks of Crackdown as Protests Widen

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS; Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
Myanmar's military junta issued its first warning on Monday after a month of widening antigovernment demonstrations, saying it was prepared to crack down on the Buddhist monks who are at the heart of the protests.
 Speaking on state television, the junta's minister of religious affairs told senior Buddhist clerics to rein in the tens of thousands of monks who have marched through several cities in recent days.
 If not, said the minister, Brig. Gen. Thura Myint Maung, unspecified action would be taken against the monks ''according to the law.''
 He said the protesting monks had been instigated by the junta's domestic and foreign enemies, the same accusation that had previously been made against members of the political opposition. Any action against the monks would be extremely risky for the government because of the reverence in which they are held in Myanmar, a Buddhist nation. The warning came at the end of a day when protesters filled the streets in greater numbers than ever, pushing their confrontation with the military government toward an unpredictable and possibly dangerous outcome. 
 In the main city of Yangon, formerly Rangoon, the monks who have led the protests for the past week were outnumbered by civilians, including prominent political dissidents and well-known cultural figures, according to news services, exile groups based in Thailand and witnesses interviewed by telephone.
 Setting out in the morning from the gold-spired Shwedagon Pagoda, a crowd estimated by The Associated Press to be as large as 100,000 marched unopposed in separate columns through the city. Other protests were reported in Mandalay, Sittwe and Bago. Monks and their supporters have also marched in other cities in recent days.
 Until now, the government had remained silent and mostly out of sight, ceding to the protesters streets that were mostly empty of any uniformed security presence. 
 ''We are in uncharted territory,'' said the British ambassador to Myanmar, Mark Canning, speaking by telephone from Yangon after observing the crowds on Monday.
 ''These demonstrations seem to be steadily picking up momentum,'' he said. ''They are widely spread geographically. They are quite well organized. They are stimulated by genuine economic hardship, and they are being done in a peaceful but very effective fashion.''
 For all the energy and jubilation of the crowds, the country formerly known as Burma seemed to be holding its breath. As the demonstrations expanded from political dissidents a month ago to Buddhist monks last week to the broad public, the government's options seemed to be narrowing.
 The country's rulers are also coming under increasing pressure from the United States, which has imposed sanctions on Myanmar for years, including a ban on all Burmese products. When President Bush, who has spoken out frequently on Myanmar, addresses the United NationsGeneral Assembly on Tuesday, he will announce more sanctions, including financial restrictions against Myanmar's leaders and a ban on visas for them and their families, said Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser. Mr. Hadley said Mr. Bush would use his address to call on other nations to support the protests. 
 The demonstrations proceeded under the shadow of the last major nationwide convulsion, in 1988, when even larger pro-democracy protests were crushed by the military at the cost of some 3,000 lives.
 The government may have been hoping that the demonstrations would simply run out of steam, but their rapid growth and the pent-up grievances that are driving them make that seem unlikely. With each day, the growing size of the crowds seems to attract even more participants.
 Another possibility is the opening of some form of compromise or dialogue between the government and its opponents. But that is an option the country's military rulers have never genuinely embraced.
 Instead, they have jailed their political opponents, held the pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest and rejected the demands of the country's marginalized ethnic minorities. When the challenges against them have seemed threatening, they have used force, as in 1988 or in 2003, the year the government unleashed a band of thugs to attack Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi when her popularity seemed to be getting out of hand.
 Myanmar was alive on Monday not only with the heady energy of mass demonstrations, but also with rumors of an impending military crackdown. Exile groups with contacts inside the country have been reporting troop movements and warnings to hospitals to prepare for many casualties.
 But analysts said a number of factors that were not present in 1988 might be constraining the government today. The first is that the world is watching. Since 1988, Myanmar has become the focus of international condemnation for its abuses of human and political rights and its treatment of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest for 12 of the past 18 years.
 It has become an embarrassment to its nine partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a regional political and economic organization; some of the group's meetings have been boycotted by the United States because of the inclusion of Myanmar. Using economic and political leverage, that association has been increasingly open in calling for reform in Myanmar.
 The most significant constraint on Myanmar's behavior may be China, its giant neighbor, which has supported it with aid and commercial ties, undermining the economic penalties imposed by Western nations.
 ''China wants stability here, and the way things are going is not really consistent with that,'' said a Western diplomat reached by telephone in Myanmar whose embassy requires anonymity as a condition for speaking.
 Chinese businesses have invested heavily in Myanmar, which is a major source of raw materials -- particularly oil and gas -- and a potential link to seaports on the Andaman Sea.
 China has said repeatedly that Myanmar's troubles are its own internal affair, and last year it blocked an American move to place Myanmar's violations of human rights on the agenda of the United Nations Security Council.
 But it has recently taken small public steps to press for democratic reform in Myanmar. In June, it arranged a highly unusual meeting in Beijing between representatives of Myanmar and the United States at which the Americans pressed for the release of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi.
 This month, as the demonstrations built in Myanmar, a senior Chinese diplomat, Tang Jiaxuan, told the visiting Myanmar foreign minister, Nyan Win, that ''China wholeheartedly hopes that Myanmar will push forward a democracy process that is appropriate for the country.''
 But with its population rising up against it in the strongest challenge of the past two decades, some analysts said, it may be too late to urge the generals to be calm. ''At this point, I think all bets are off and the Chinese will have no real influence on what they do,'' said David Mathieson, an expert on Myanmar with the international rights group Human Rights Watch.

HEADLINE: Few Welcome Mats for Smokers

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
If you think the biggest pariah in the travel industry is an overzealous airport security screener, an unsympathetic gate agent or a pilot on a delayed plane, clearly you do not travel with a pack of cigarettes and a lighter in your carry-on bag.
 With more states and municipalities banning smoking in public places, including airports, and more hotels adopting no-smoking policies that include bars, restaurants and guest rooms, it is getting tougher for travelers with a nicotine habit to find a place to light up. 
 Westin Hotels, a Starwood brand, banned smoking in its properties in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean in January 2006, a move followed by Marriott's 10 brands last September. Dozens of independent hotels and members of other chains have also gone smoke-free. 
 More than 120 airports in the United States do not allow smoking anywhere indoors, according to data collected by the advocacy group Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, and most car rental companies generally prohibit smoking in their vehicles.
 Not everyone is jumping on the smoke-free bandwagon, however. Some hotels and airports accommodate their customers who cannot kick the habit, still a substantial proportion of the population.
 The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says about 21 percent of American adults smoke, a figure that has remained consistent in recent years.
 Keeping that statistic in mind, representatives from InterContinental Hotels Group, Hilton and Hyatt said they have no plans to eliminate smoking rooms throughout their chains, though those rooms may represent as little as 1 percent of inventory. 
 Airports face an arguably tougher choice. For instance, Detroit Metropolitan Airport allows smoking in two bars that have been outfitted with special ventilation systems. It also allows smoking in a room inside a Northwest Airlines WorldClub, a lounge accessible only to paying members.
 Michael Conway, an airport spokesman, said giving passengers designated places to smoke inside the terminal was a tough call but one that has had clear benefits. Since the smoking areas were set up, for instance, far fewer door alarms are set off by nicotine-deprived travelers looking for the quickest route outdoors.
 It has also reduced reports of smoking in restrooms, and the need to re-screen connecting passengers who dash out to the curb to smoke between flights. 
 ''People who need to have a cigarette are going to find a place to smoke, and they're going to be smoking in places you don't want them,'' Mr. Conway said. ''This way, we've got the smokers controlled.''
 In fact, many smokers say they would prefer to light up in designated areas rather than violate a no-smoking policy.
 ''Personally, I don't like going in rental cars that are nonsmoking or hotel rooms that are nonsmoking because you annoy people,'' said Larry Shannon, an engineering consultant based in Buffalo, who has smoked since he was 6 years old.
 Despite Marriott's smoking ban, he is still a platinum guest with the chain, opting to indulge his habit outside. (Marriott hotels have smoking areas at least 25 feet away from the main entrance.) He also says he heads outside if there is time during airport layovers.
 ''You go check the security line, and if it looks like it's going to be a couple minutes, you dash out,'' Mr. Shannon said.
 Eric Neubauer, a sales manager who travels frequently from his home in Ohio to Britain, has another solution to the challenge of a smoke-free long-haul flight. ''Any flight over six hours, I buy the smoking patches,'' he said. ''Then when I land I rip them off.''
 Travelers with a need for nicotine, it seems, find other ways to deal with their habit. Wayne Hubbard, a management consultant based near Austin, Texas, smoked on the balcony outside his room during an extended stay at a Marriott Residence Inn after the no-smoking policy went into effect. He also has a solution to the lack of lighters in most rental cars.
 ''I carry my own little cigarette lighter in my briefcase that I plug into the power socket,'' he said. 
 That probably will not come as a surprise to anyone who has rented a car with a lingering odor of stale cigarettes, or to industry executives who acknowledge that no-smoking policies can be tough to enforce.
 ''Once the car is out of our hands, you can't control people's behavior,'' said Chris Payne, a spokesman for Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, which designates all its rental cars as nonsmoking vehicles, generally through stickers on the windows. 
 Companies sometimes charge extra cleaning fees when customers violate no-smoking policies, but this can lead to angry travelers claiming they were improperly charged.
 Marriott, for instance, assesses a $250 ''room recovery fee'' if housekeeping and management determine a guest has smoked in a nonsmoking room, based on cigarette odors, butts or burns, said John Wolf, a Marriott spokesman.
 But complaints on travel message boards claim the hotel's ''smoking police'' have mistaken clothing odors or the presence of cigarettes in the room as a violation of the ban, a debate that can be difficult to settle definitively.
 Nevertheless, Mr. Wolf said Marriott's no-smoking policy has not hurt business, and has reduced complaints related to smoking, one of the main sources of guest discontent.
 Ultimately, industry executives and medical experts point to the health of nonsmoking travelers and workers as the main justification for these bans.
 ''There's no level of secondhand smoke exposure that can be declared to be safe,'' said Matthew McKenna, director of the C.D.C.'s office on smoking and health, noting that airline unions led the push to eliminate smoking on planes.
 He also pointed out that research measuring the effects of no-smoking policies in restaurants and bars has shown these policies are not bad for the bottom line.
 ''The studies that are not funded by the tobacco industry very clearly demonstrate that there's no economic impact, no decrease in business,'' Dr. McKenna said.

HEADLINE: Gas Emissions Rarely Figure in Investor Decisions

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Corporations have become better about disclosing their greenhouse gas emissions and somewhat better about curbing them. But few investors are using that information to decide where to put their money.
 That was the gist of the fifth annual report of the Carbon Disclosure Project, a nonprofit group that monitors corporate disclosure related to climate change. The group, which gathers its data through surveys, represents 315 institutional investors that manage a total of $41 trillion in assets.
 ''Large companies are finally taking their jackets off, rolling up their sleeves and examining how they use energy and otherwise deal with climate change,'' said Paul Dickinson, chief executive of the project. 
 The report said that 79 percent of respondents saw risk in climate change, and many were trying to mitigate it. Several food and beverage companies reported steps to ensure their water supplies, while several insurance companies said they were quantifying risks from severe storms. 
 And 82 percent of respondents spotted opportunities in curbing climate change, through investing in carbon credits and renewable energy projects, creating products and refining processes. 
 Automotive companies, for example, reported more research into hybrid electric vehicles, while chemical companies said they were developing storm-resistant construction materials and crop-protection products.
 But there was little agreement among companies within industries on the effect of climate change. Boeing, for example, said it had not identified any ''specific physical risks'' from climate change, while Northrup Grumman detailed the damage that ''severe weather conditions'' could cause its operations. 
 More troubling to the project's executives, though, is that few companies include climate-related data in their filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The result, the report said, is that the ramifications of climate change have not yet translated into ''concrete investment decisions on any scale.'' 
 The project released the report, which included responses from 1,300 companies, at a standing-room-only event yesterday at Merrill Lynch headquarters in Lower Manhattan. The data is available at www.cdproject.net.
 ''We provide a huge stage on which corporate actors can say their piece to investors,'' Mr. Dickinson said. 
 There was ample star power on stage. Harold E. Ford Jr., the former congressman who became a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch this year, moderated. 
 Former President Bill Clinton gave the keynote address, in which he said that the United States was way behind countries like Denmark and Britain, which had created many jobs from the process of curbing greenhouse gases. He cited plentiful ''anecdotal evidence'' that curbing climate change can be an economic boon to wealthy and emerging nations alike. 
 ''But I can't prove that,'' he said, ''because we don't have the data and systems in place to demonstrate the likelihood of best outcomes.'' The project is important, he said, ''because the payouts are measurable only if you keep score.''
 Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, appeared on video, reiterating his company's commitment to curbing global warming. And John Fleming, the vice president for merchandising at Wal-Mart Stores, announced a pilot program that his company is initiating with suppliers of seven common items -- DVDs, toothpaste, soap, milk, beer, vacuum cleaners and soda -- to measure and reduce the amount of energy they use. 
 ''We are reaching out to the next generation of consumers, who may well choose stores on the basis of climate change practices,'' Mr. Fleming said. 
 The project is working with Wal-Mart on that initiative, and Mr. Dickinson said he hoped to set up similar collaborations with automotive and aviation companies, consumer products manufacturers, and other retailers. 
 ''We look forward to other global corporations following Wal-Mart's lead,'' he said. 
 While the overall tenor of the written report and the oral presentations was optimistic, there were notes of caution. The project operates on the honor system, in that there is no independent verification by which to judge corporate claims. In fact, the report specifically cautions investors against acting on unverified information. 
 Nor are environmentalists uniformly supportive of the report. The Rainforest Action Network displayed banners outside the event, protesting Citigroup and Bank of America -- both companies that reported low levels of emissions -- for continuing to invest in coal projects. The carbon project ''does ask about that, but it is an often ignored question,'' said Brianna Cayo Cotter, a spokeswoman for the Rainforest Action Network.

HEADLINE: Jane Jacobs, Foe of Plans And Friend Of City Life

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
Nearly a half century ago, at the dawn of an era renowned for its utopian dreams and dystopian diagnoses, a journalist who loved the American city wrote an attack on all the professional planners and idealists who believed they could design the perfect urban habitat, the city beautiful, a metropolitan Eden. 
 Forget it, was the message Jane Jacobs elegantly hammered home in that 1961 book, ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities.'' There is no utopia to be found. And every fantasy of such a paradise -- the Modernist towers of Le Corbusier, the Garden Cities of Ebenezer Howard, the cleared slums and ribboned roadways of Robert Moses -- has led to urban desolation and ruin. At the time she wrote her book, cities were beginning to totter like drunken derelicts seeking lampposts for support. 
 As an exhibition opening today at the Municipal Art Society reminds us, Jane Jacobs did not believe that planners could ever restore life to American cities. Instead she put her faith in the chaos of urban life, in diversity, in people -- the grocery store owner, the young mother, the child playing in the street, the watchful busybodies leaning out of windows. Cities were at their best, she wrote, when the ''ballet of the sidewalks'' was evident, a dance that was intrinsically ''spontaneous and untidy.'' Her prescription was simply not to get in its way.
 With this kind of loose-limbed populism, it is no wonder that in a 1961 letter shown at the exhibition, Robert Moses -- with whom Jacobs more than once locked horns -- bluntly writes to her publisher: ''I am returning the book you sent me. Aside from the fact that it is intemperate and inaccurate, it is also libelous.''
 Moses, who more than any other figure had given shape to 20th-century New York, with grand institutional construction projects ranging from Lincoln Center to public swimming pools, from the Henry Hudson Parkway to the Belt Parkway, concluded, ''Sell this junk to someone else.''
 That is, of course, precisely what was done, and with great success. Jacobs's book, like other landmarks of that era that jousted with established principles and perspectives, including Rachel Carson's vision of the environment and Paul Goodman's vision of education, defined a new populism, transforming the institutions of its time and giving birth to those that thrive in our own. Under Jacobs's influence, there arose new ways of thinking about cities; community groups became active participants in city planning, and new developments started to take street life into account. Jacobs died in 2006, receiving encomiums from both the political right and left. 
 But as New York seems to be revving up for another generation of urban development -- including the Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's environmental projects -- as new neighborhoods have taken shape, like Battery Park City, and old ones change in function and status, like Dumbo in Brooklyn, the issues that Jacobs and her opponents raised remain as vital as ever. 
 With that backdrop, the society's exhibition -- created, like Jacobs's first book, with support from the Rockefeller Foundation -- invokes her as an enduring model, citing not just her ideas but also her activism, hailing contemporary community organizations like the United Puerto Rican Organization of Sunset Park, Brooklyn, with its emphasis on ''social justice and environmental concerns,'' as her heirs. In this show the society urges New Yorkers to ''observe and recognize the best of their city'' and ''become citizen activists advocating for positive change.'' 
 The problem, though, is that the issues are more complicated than the exhibition's advocacy will allow, and more urgent than its modest scope permits visitors to understand. And while last year's series of major exhibitions about Moses at the Museum of the City of New York, the Queens Museum of Art and Columbia University began to show that he was more complex than his caricature -- a visionary as well as a ruthless master builder -- this show does not seek to illuminate any ambiguities or difficulties latent in Jacobs's vision. It leaves her intact, as a populist prophet.
 This is still a valuable exhibition, though, because like Jacobs's ideas, it is grounded not in theory, but in experience. ''Please look closely,'' urges the introductory panel after you enter the modest galleries through an archway of monitors showing the street life of contemporary New York.
 ''What do you observe?'' another panel asks, next to a 24-hour time-lapse video of Madison Avenue street life outside a nearby window. Another display shows the variety of routes taken by residents of Fort Greene in Brooklyn and Midtown West in Manhattan through their neighborhoods.
 As a demonstration of some of Jacobs's most important ideas, such displays are excellent; they focus on ''four key qualities of healthy, vibrant cities'': 1) Streets should have mixed use, with retail and residences mingled. 2) Streets should be frequent, without too many long blocks, thus encouraging interaction and exploration. 3) Buildings should be varied in purpose and design and, ideally, date from different eras. And 4) urban concentration is important and encourages diversity.
 ''Jacobs's observations,'' the exhibition argues, ''remain critical to New York today.'' 
 The show also demonstrates those principles using Jacobs's own examples, contrasting, for example, the mixed-use variety of 57th Street, where Carnegie Hall stands, with the stark uniformity of street life created by Lincoln Center at the time of its opening. The dead streets outside one of New York University's stone buildings in Greenwich Village are also contrasted with the 24-hour life displayed on the street outside the new home of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in Midtown. 
 The bustle of Flushing, Queens, with its diverse street life, is juxtaposed with the tree-lined, suburban-style neighborhood of Forest Hills, which, while ''undeniably pleasant,'' ''attracts only residents of a single income bracket and thus lacks the diversity of people and conveniences that tends to give cities vitality.''
 But partly because the exhibition is so clear in this exposition, it also inadvertently draws attention to some of the flaws in Jacobs's vision. She was open to many aspects of urban life, but the ''ballet of the sidewalks'' tends to overshadow its other features, and the show amplifies her flaws with its narrow focus. 
 Despite her argument, for example, there are times when ''single-use'' blocks have their own value, creating, for example, residential neighborhoods in which children really do play in the street; 1960s-era Hudson Street, where Jacobs lived, is not the only vital urban model. Neighborhoods like Forest Hills, zones of aspiration and private retreat, have always been part of a city's life, making their own contributions to its appeal. 
 And while there is much to be said against single-use construction of arts centers (which have created eerie, car-centered oases in many dark downtowns), Lincoln Center's impact over 40 years has transformed the entire Upper West Side of Manhattan, spurring the evolution of many vital neighborhoods in a way that a single concert hall could not. 
 Moreover, though Jacobs wrote that ''there is a basic aesthetic limitation on what can be done with cities,'' she has little to say about the impact of beautiful design and public spaces; in the mid-19th century, for example, Haussmann destroyed swaths of medieval Paris, triumphantly reshaping it with his aesthetic ideals. Great ancient cities are unthinkable without ideals of form and beauty that do not interest Jacobs at all. 
 Even the community activism being heralded here needs a larger context. Despite their achievements, there are times when community groups may have too parochial a vision to be taken as guides to a city's future. 
 In fact, despite Jacobs's own warnings about planners and their doctrines, there is even a whiff of utopianism in the way in which her ideas are being celebrated, with a prescriptive focus on diversity and populism. 
 One of the virtues of a city is that it allows more diversity than even this exhibition suggests. It allows the creation of neighborhoods that serve single purposes; it allows grand boulevards whose expanses seem to lead the imagination beyond the city walls; it allows figures like Robert Moses to change the geography of the landscape so the city can adapt to technological revolutions. 
 And finally, it allows a figure like Jane Jacobs to make her own distinctive contributions -- warning us against expecting too much from any visionary and expanding our understanding with her meticulous and generous imagination. 
 ''Jane Jacobs and the Future of New York'' continues through Jan. 5 at the Municipal Art Society, 457 Madison Avenue, at 51st Street; (212) 935-3960 or mas.org.

 BODY:
The launching of Sputnik on Oct. 4, 1957, was a life-changing event -- one that ignited imaginations, dictated the course of careers, and changed the way people thought about science, education and global politics. The New York Times asked scientists and others who lived through it (and a few who were yet to be born) to reflect on what Sputnik meant to them.
 Homer H. Hickam, 64, author of ''Rocket Boys,'' a memoir adapted for the movie ''October Sky.''
 I was a high school sophomore in Coalwood, W. Va., and I read in the newspaper that Sputnik was going to fly over southern West Virginia. At the appointed hour, our neighbors came to our yard to help me watch it. My father said, ''Well, they can all go home because President Eisenhower will never allow anything Russian to fly over Coalwood!'' 
 But at the appointed moment, Sputnik flew over Coalwood. If it had been God in his chariot that had flown over, I could not have been more impressed. It was awe-inspiring. Sputnik looked like a bright star that moved with such utter purpose that nothing could stop it; and I, in that moment, realized I wanted to be part of the movement into space. In that moment, I decided to get a job with Wernher von Braun. 
 I ended up having a 17-year career in NASA, as a designer of spacecraft and an astronaut training manager. 
 Ernst Stuhlinger, 93, former director, space science, Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala., and former deputy to Wernher von Braun.
 Exactly a week before the Sputnik launch, on Sept. 27, 1957, I went to our commanding general in Huntsville, Gen. John Medaris, and told him, ''General, I have a number of indications that the Russians are very close to launching a satellite.'' 
 The head of the Russian Academy of Sciences had mentioned in the news that the Russians were planning to launch a satellite in the next couple of days. The Russians even gave the frequency of the transmitter which would make the sounds of the little satellite audible on Earth. I was in contact with a number of colleagues who told me this. 
 He didn't believe it. He said: ''Ernst, calm down. Don't get nervous. The Russians are not ready to launch a satellite.''
 A week later, I was in a taxi in Barcelona and I heard the news on the radio. I said to myself, ''Well, I told you so.'' 
 It was very exciting for me, of course. The next thing I thought was, ''I have a lot of admiration for the Russian space people who did that.'' I thought: ''You people in Russia, you won the first round. You may even win the second round -- a man in orbit. But we have a good chance to win the third round, and that will be the trip to the Moon.'' And then I immediately felt a kind of thankfulness to the Russian colleagues because it was a wonderful wake-up call for us Americans. 
 When I came back from Barcelona, I met with Dr. von Braun, who also had the feeling that it was very fortunate that the Russians had launched their satellite. He was very excited about it. We had many plans on our hands, and this gave us the assurance that we were on the right track with our plans. And when you think how successful our trip to the Moon was -- almost exactly 10 years later -- we were on the right track!
 Walter Cronkite, 90, former anchor and managing editor, ''CBS Evening News.''
 I was almost certainly in my office at CBS when I heard about the launch. I was rather excited that we were making a major step forward in the space program -- both the Russians and us. 
 I had been a reporter in the Soviet Union and I knew they were working on space, but I didn't realize that they were going to come to it so much more quickly than we were. In Moscow, you'd read stuff in journals and papers that indicated that there was some progress, but we didn't know what the Russians actually had. We had a sense that they were interested in space, but we didn't know how advanced it was. So when Sputnik came, it was quite a shock for us. It awakened a lot of people to the space program. Sputnik awakened everyone.
 Esther Dyson, 56, of EDventure Holdings, investor in space and Internet start-ups, and daughter of the physicist Freeman Dyson.
 We weren't astonished by the Sputnik launch in my family, because my father knew Russian scientists and we knew that Russians were really smart. 
 I'm hoping that the next thing that happens is that the Chinese will do something similar -- go to the Moon or do something with Mars. It will have the same impact. People will say, ''My gosh, we need to do something with our space program,'' which at the moment is suffering from a lack of funding, attention and respect. Maybe the Chinese will give us a wake-up call the same way the Russians did. 
 Sir Martin Rees, 65, astronomer royal of Britain.
 The Sputnik launch was widely reported in the U.K. There was a special interest because the Jodrell Bank radio telescope had just been completed, and it was one of the few instruments in the world capable of tracking Sputnik. 
 I was 15, and I recall watching those reports from Jodrell Bank on my parents' flickering black-and-white television. 
 Certainly in the U.K. in 1957, there was general admiration of the Soviet space program, though many of us were indifferent as to whether it was the U.S. or the Soviets who had been to space first. It was, for us, a spectator sport -- a byproduct of superpower rivalry. 
 Of course, we followed the subsequent developments of the Russian space program: first dog in orbit, first man in orbit. When the cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin visited the U.K., he was mobbed by enthusiastic crowds. Harold Macmillan, the prime minister, a man well attuned to the national character, cynically noted that the crowds would have been bigger if the Russians had sent the dog. 
 Those who are now middle-aged can recall the exciting progress that culminated in Apollo. But for young people today it's ancient history: they know the Americans put men on the Moon; they know the Egyptians built the pyramids. But both episodes seem ancient history -- endeavors driven by arcane motives hard now to understand.
 Neil deGrasse Tyson, 48, director, Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History.
 I was born a year and a day after Sputnik. 
 Even as a child in the Bronx, I was aware of its influence on society because the space launches were in the headlines. The move of the United States to compete on the frontier of space created an atmosphere of great interest in science. However, the people NASA was lining up to send into space, in those early years, were many skin shades lighter than I was. It meant that NASA did not have me in mind in this new frontier of space. And so my interest in the universe was not born of NASA, but came from books, teachers and visits to New York's Hayden Planetarium. 
 I never wanted to be an astronaut. As a child in the 1960s, the civil rights movement was what engaged my attention. There was a limit to how much I could celebrate America putting white military pilots into space, while my family was being denied the option to move into the apartment building of our choice. For these reasons, I became an astrophysicist not because of NASA, but in spite of it. 
 Ursula K. Le Guin, 77, author of many science fiction novels, including ''The Left Hand of Darkness.''
 I was busy having babies at the time. But I thought Sputnik was cool. I do remember going out to watch the little thing go by. It blinked. I think it blinked as it turned. Sputnik was different from the cold war mindset of the time. I felt proud, as a human. ''We've done something.'' It didn't matter whether it was us or the Russians. 
 Margaret J. Geller, senior scientist, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.
 For many in the physical sciences, Sputnik had a big impact. There was a large increase in spending for science, and there were increased physics courses. The number of undergraduates getting degrees in physics peaked in 1970-1, as a result of this investment. 
 By the time I went to graduate school, 1970, it was the beginning of cuts in support for the physical sciences. That has continued till today, eroding our scientific and economic leadership. When I was an undergraduate, people going into science had the idea that the United States would lead broadly in scientific research. That is no longer the national view. 
 Tom Lehrer, 79, mathematician and writer-performer of satirical songs including ''Wernher von Braun'' and ''New Math.''
 I was of course aware of Sputnik, but I didn't give it much thought. I was surprised at all the fuss. I was much more impressed by color television. 
 It did have, however, at least one memorable, though ephemeral, consequence. Americans were evidently afraid that Sputnik was proof that the Russians were getting ahead of us because of the inadequate science and math teaching in our schools. In an attempt to attack the problem, some committee came up with a ridiculous curriculum called ''New Math,'' in which they tried to teach kids abstract concepts that they couldn't understand. The teachers weren't prepared to teach it, and the kids couldn't have cared less about it and its dubious practicality. Despite the money poured into it by the government, the fad soon died of natural causes.
 Edward T. Lu, 44, former NASA astronaut.
 Sputnik happened six years before I was born. I know that it drove the U.S. to send spacecraft, and later men, into space, and so it indirectly changed where I ended up in my life. I was an astronaut for 12 years, a profession that didn't exist before the events of the 1960s and 1970s. 
 In 2003, I was on the International Space Station for six months with the Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko. He told me he'd been named Yuri for Yuri Gagarin, their first man into space. If you look at Russia, there are a lot of Yuris of a certain age because of Yuri Gagarin. 
 Jose Vazquez, 44, who teaches the course History of the Universe at New York University.
 Though I wasn't born at the time of Sputnik, I experienced the reforms it brought. My teachers told me that after the launching of Sputnik, the public school I attended in Puerto Rico began offering revised science courses that focused on underlying principles and inquiry-based learning. Prior to that, biology primarily consisted of the ''fern/frog approach,'' dissecting frogs and drawing pictures of ferns. Students like myself were not prepared to undertake basic science research.
 After Sputnik, there were new policies to attract gifted students from minorities to the sciences. I benefited from those. Without these programs, I would never have had the means to pursue a scientific education. Prior to Sputnik, most Puerto Ricans youngsters were restricted to what was called a ''life adjustment'' curriculum, where the focus was on vocational education or joining the armed forces. 
 To me, the impact of Sputnik was transforming.

HEADLINE: When Science Suddenly Mattered, in Space and in Class

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
The students in Mr. Smoot's science class in 1957 in the Lewis School in Birmingham, Ala., might not have seen Sputnik or heard its beeping, but they felt its presence. 
 ''We stopped having throwaway science and started having real science,'' recalled Shirley Malcolm, one of the students. ''Here I was, a black kid in a segregated school that was under-resourced -- Sputnik kind of crossed the barrier. All of a sudden everybody was talking about it, and science was above the fold in the newspaper, and my teachers went to institutes and really got us all engaged. It was just a time of incredible intensity and attention to science.''
 For many, Sputnik was proof that American education, particularly in science, had fallen behind. Scientists and engineers warned Congress that the cold war was being fought with slide rules, not rifles. In response Congress passed the National Defense Education Act in 1958, providing, among other things, college scholarships and other help for aspiring scientists, engineers and mathematicians. Meanwhile, some of the nation's eminent scientists were collaborating on new ways to teach high school physics, biology and chemistry. 
 ''Those were heady times,'' recalled Gerald F. Wheeler, who as a young high school physics teacher participated in workshops on one of these plans, the Physical Sciences Study Committee's curriculum for physics. Its ideas were so fresh they were presented on mimeographed sheets rather than printed pages. ''It was very high-energy networking,'' he said. ''Science teachers trying to do a much better job teaching.'' 
 Today Dr. Wheeler, a physicist, heads the National Science Teachers Association, and Dr. Malcolm, an ecologist, is director of education and human resources at the American Association for the Advancement of Science. And the landscape of science education is far different. 
 ''We look at declining numbers of students who think that math, science or engineering is what they want to do,'' Dr. Malcolm said. ''We lived many years off the investment of the race for space,'' she said, but today there is ''a kind of complacency.''
 She is hardly the first to sound this warning. In 1983, a bipartisan federal commission warned in the report ''A Nation at Risk'' that the country was engulfed in a ''rising tide of mediocrity,'' citing particularly a ''steady decline in science achievement.''
 More than 20 years later, a panel established by the National Academies, the nation's leading organizations in science, medicine and engineering, said much the same thing. In ''Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' a report issued in 2005, the panel said the erosion of the nation's scientific and technical strength threatened America's strategic and economic security. 
 Both of these documents, like other reports and expert recommendations, called for more scholarships for would-be scientists, higher teacher salaries and other efforts to halt a national erosion of technical proficiency.
 But none of them produced the widespread ferment and public engagement of Sputnik.
 In the decades after the launching of the satellite, Dr. Malcolm said, ''other things refocused your attention,'' like the civil rights movement, the war in Vietnam, the war in Iraq or even, she said, the celebrity culture of today. Over the years, the education act's initiatives lost their tight science focus or were absorbed by other programs. 
 The end of the cold war further diminished the national urge ''to do anything spectacular in science education,'' said Charles H. Holbrow, who abandoned an almost-complete doctorate in history and switched to physics after Sputnik. Dr. Holbrow, an emeritus professor of physics at Colgate and a visiting professor at M.I.T., spoke on Sputnik's influence at a recent meeting of the American Physical Society. 
 There is no shortage of ideas about how to turn things around. But people who study the issue see several problems.
 Dr. Malcolm said some of the blame must go to the way classes are taught, with too much emphasis on memorizing terminology and not enough on concepts. Most students receive teaching-to-the-test instruction, she and other experts say, in which science laboratories are organized like cookbooks, with ingredients, equipment and instructions -- and results -- known in advance. 
 Ideally, Dr. Malcolm said, students should be given the chance to do real research -- to experience framing a question, deciding what kind of evidence is relevant and figuring out how to collect it. ''I'm not saying there's not drudgery in science,'' she said, ''but when you get to the point where all the data are sitting in front of you and you start seeing patterns and nature begins to speak -- that's a kick.''
 The Bush administration has started a Mathematics and Science Initiative that aims to draw attention to the need for math and science, train more teachers in the subjects and identify ''effective instructional strategies.'' 
 But Dr. Holbrow said, ''We know what works, that education that engages the students directly in a hands-on way with the materials is much more effective.'' 
 He is among the experts on science education who say that the hands-on approach does not mesh well with the No Child Left Behind law, the Bush administration's major education initiative, which emphasizes standardized tests and focuses on reading and math.
 Advocates of the approach note that testing on science will begin next year, but Dr. Wheeler says he does not hold out much hope for it, ''because it's not in the yearly assessment, only three times in the 12-year span'' from elementary to high school. 
 Others point to the state and local control over school curriculums, beloved by Americans but rare in other developed countries. Dr. Malcolm said some states or localities may set the curriculum bar too low, while in other countries students are asked ''to learn more, to know more, to work harder.'' 
 Some experts on science education also point to the typical sequence of high school science instruction: biology, chemistry and then physics. It would make more sense in reverse, these people say, because the principles of physics underlie chemistry, which is crucial for an understanding of biology.
 Perhaps the leading champion of this ''physics first'' approach is Leon M. Lederman, a particle physicist, Nobel laureate and former director of Fermilab whose focus lately has been on improving science and math education. He said the current biology-chemistry-physics sequence dates from the late 19th century, when ''we didn't know enough'' and biology was considered a ''descriptive'' subject.
 In fact, Dr. Lederman said, ''biology is the most complicated of all subjects, and it is based on chemistry and physics.'' And, he added, ''there is nothing in chemistry, no fact of chemistry or process of chemistry that if you ask 'Why does this happen?' you don't go back to physics.''
 He said that about a thousand high schools had adopted the ''physics first'' approach, and preliminary reports were encouraging. But if students took physics first, there would be a big increase in physics enrollments and an increased need for people to teach it. And drawing people trained in science into the nation's classrooms is already a problem.
 ''We do not respond to market forces with regard to our science-math people,'' Dr. Malcolm said.
 Dr. Lederman believes that ''the only way we are going to get serious is if we rouse the public.'' 
 ''A public that has a sense of science makes democracy work,'' he said. ''If you don't understand the language in which people are discussing global warming or all the other issues, you cannot have a democracy. 
 Today ''echoes'' of Sputnik-era science curriculums live on in some textbooks, Dr. Wheeler said, but ''in terms of the mass market, it just did not make it.'' In part, he and others say, that is because many teachers found these programs difficult to teach and worried that they reached the brightest students but left the others behind.
 Organizations like the National Science Foundation have programs to advance science education, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science has Project 2061, aimed at producing widespread science literacy by the time Halley's Comet makes its next appearance.
 And in response, in part, to the ''Gathering Storm'' report, Congress last month passed the 21st Century Competitiveness Act, which, among other things, would provide more money for science education. 
 ''But that was just the authorization,'' Dr. Malcolm said. ''I don't know where the money is going to come from.''

HEADLINE: Save the Day

BYLINE: By STEPHEN S. ROACH. 
Stephen S. Roach is the chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia.

DATELINE: Hong Kong 

 BODY:
 CURRENCIES are first and foremost relative prices -- in essence, they are measures of the intrinsic value of one economy versus another. On that basis, the world has had no compunction in writing down the value of the United States over the past several years. The dollar, relative to the currencies of most of America's trading partners, is off about 20 percent from its early 2002 peak. Recently it has hit new lows against the euro and a high-flying Canadian currency, likely a harbinger of more weakness to come.
 Sadly, none of this is surprising. Because Americans haven't been saving in sufficient amounts, the United States must import surplus savings from abroad in order to grow. And it has to run record balance of payments and trade deficits in order to attract that foreign capital. The United States current account deficit -- the broadest gauge of America's imbalance in relation to the rest of the world -- hit a record 6.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2006 before receding slightly this year. America must still attract some $3 billion of foreign capital each business day in order to keep its economy growing. 
 Economic science is very clear on the implications of such huge imbalances: foreign lenders need to be compensated for sending scarce capital to any country with a deficit. The bigger the deficit, the greater the compensation. The currency of the deficit nation usually bears the brunt of that compensation. As long as the United States fails to address its saving problem, its large balance of payments deficit will persist and the dollar will keep dropping. 
 The only silver lining so far has been that these adjustments to the currency have been orderly -- declines in the broad dollar index averaging a little less than 4 percent per year since early 2002. Now, however, the possibility of a disorderly correction is rising -- with potentially grave consequences for the American and global economy.
 A key reason is the mounting risk of a recession in America. The bursting of the sub-prime mortgage bubble -- strikingly reminiscent of the dot-com excesses of the 1990s -- could well be a tipping point. In both cases, financial markets and policy makers were steeped in denial over the risks. But the lessons of post-bubble adjustments are clear. Just ask economically stagnant Japan. And of course, the United States lapsed into its own post-bubble recession in 2000 and '01. 
 Sadly, the endgame could be considerably more treacherous for the United States than it was seven years ago. In large part, that's because the American consumer is now at risk. Consumption expenditures currently account for a record 72 percent of the gross domestic product -- a number unmatched in the annals of modern history for any nation. 
 This buying binge has been increasingly supported by housing and lending bubbles. Yet home prices are now headed lower -- probably for years -- and the fallout from the subprime crisis has seriously crimped home mortgage refinancing. With weaker employment growth also putting pressure on income, the days of open-ended American consumption are likely to finally come to an end. That will make it hard to avoid a recession. 
 Fearful of that possibility, foreign investors are becoming increasingly skittish over buying dollar-based assets. The spillover effects of the subprime crisis into other asset markets -- especially mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed commercial paper -- underscore these concerns. Foreign appetite for United States financial instruments is likely to be sharply reduced for years to come. That would choke off an important avenue of capital inflows, putting more downward pressure on the dollar. 
 The political winds are also blowing against the dollar. In Washington, China-bashing is the bipartisan sport du jour. New legislation is likely that would impose trade sanctions on China unless it makes a major adjustment in its currency. Not only would this be an egregious policy blunder -- attempting to fix a multilateral deficit with more than 40 nations by forcing an exchange rate adjustment with one country -- but it would also amount to Washington taxing one of America's major foreign lenders. 
 That would undoubtedly reduce China's desire for United States assets, and unless another foreign buyer stepped up, the dollar would come under even more pressure. Moreover, the more the Fed under Ben Bernanke follows the easy-money Alan Greenspan script, the greater the risk to the dollar.
 Why worry about a weaker dollar? The United States imported $2.2 trillion of goods and services in 2006. A sharp drop in the dollar makes those items considerably more expensive -- the functional equivalent of a tax hike on consumers. It could also stoke fears of inflation -- driving up long-term interest rates and putting more pressure on financial markets and the economy, exacerbating recession risks. Optimists may draw comfort from the vision of an export-led renewal arising from a more competitive dollar. Yet history is clear: no nation has ever devalued its way into prosperity. 
 So far, the dollar's weakness has not been a big deal. That may now be about to change. Relative to the rest of the world, the United States looks painfully subprime. So does its currency.

HEADLINE: Outsourcing Works So Well, India Is Sending Jobs Abroad

BYLINE: By ANAND GIRIDHARADAS

DATELINE: MYSORE, India 

 BODY:
Thousands of Indians report to Infosys Technologies' campus here to learn the finer points of programming. Lately, though, packs of foreigners have been roaming the manicured lawns, too. 
 Many of them are recent American college graduates, and some have even turned down job offers from coveted employers like Google. Instead, they accepted a novel assignment from Infosys, the Indian technology giant: fly here for six months of training, then return home to work in the company's American back offices.
 India is outsourcing outsourcing. 
 One of the constants of the global economy has been companies moving their tasks -- and jobs -- to India. But rising wages and a stronger currency here, demands for workers who speak languages other than English, and competition from countries looking to emulate India's success as a back office -- including China, Morocco and Mexico -- are challenging that model. 
 Many executives here acknowledge that outsourcing, having rained most heavily on India, will increasingly sprinkle tasks around the globe. Or, as Ashok Vemuri, an Infosys senior vice president, put it, the future of outsourcing is ''to take the work from any part of the world and do it in any part of the world.''
 To fight on the shifting terrain, and to beat back emerging rivals, Indian companies are hiring workers and opening offices in developing countries themselves, before their clients do. 
 In May, Tata Consultancy Service, Infosys's Indian rival, announced a new back office in Guadalajara, Mexico; Tata already has 5,000 workers in Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. Cognizant Technology Solutions, with most of its operations in India, has now opened back offices in Phoenix and Shanghai. 
 Wipro, another Indian technology services company, has outsourcing offices in Canada, China, Portugal, Romania and Saudi Arabia, among other locations. 
 And last month, Wipro said it was opening a software development center in Atlanta that would hire 500 programmers in three years. 
 In a poetic reflection of outsourcing's new face, Wipro's chairman, Azim Premji, told Wall Street analysts this year that he was considering hubs in Idaho and Virginia, in addition to Georgia, to take advantage of American ''states which are less developed.'' (India's per capita income is less than $1,000 a year.)
 For its part, Infosys is building a whole archipelago of back offices -- in Mexico, the Czech Republic, Thailand and China, as well as low-cost regions of the United States.
 The company seeks to become a global matchmaker for outsourcing: any time a company wants work done somewhere else, even just down the street, Infosys wants to get the call. 
 It is a peculiar ambition for a company that symbolizes the flow of tasks from the West to India.
 Most of Infosys's 75,000 employees are Indians, in India. They account for most of the company's $3.1 billion in sales in the year that ended March 31, from work for clients like Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. 
 ''India continues to be the No. 1 location for outsourcing,'' S. Gopalakrishnan, the company's chief executive, said in a telephone interview.
 And yet the company opened a Philippines office in August and, a month earlier, bought back offices in Thailand and Poland from Royal Philips Electronics, the Dutch company. In each outsourcing hub, local employees work with little help from Indian managers. 
 Infosys says its outsourcing experience in India has taught it to carve up a project, apportion each slice to suitable workers, double-check quality and then export a final, reassembled product to clients. The company argues it can clone its Indian back offices in other nations and groom Chinese, Mexican or Czech employees to be more productive than local outsourcing companies could make them.
 ''We have pioneered this movement of work,'' Mr. Gopalakrishnan said. ''These new countries don't have experience and maturity in doing that, and that's what we're taking to these countries.''
 Some analysts compare the strategy to Japanese penetration of auto manufacturing in the United States in the 1970s. Just as the Japanese learned to make cars in America without Japanese workers, Indian vendors are learning to outsource without Indians, said Dennis McGuire, chairman of TPI, a Texas-based outsourcing consultancy.
 Though work that bypasses India remains a small part of the Infosys business, it is growing. The company can be highly secretive, but executives agreed to describe some of the new projects on the condition that clients not be identified. 
 In one project, an American bank wanted a computer system to handle a loan program for Hispanic customers. The system had to work in Spanish. It also had to take into account variables particular to Hispanic clients: many, for instance, remit money to families abroad, which can affect their bank balances. The bank thought a Mexican team would have the right language skills and grasp of cultural nuances.
 But instead of going to a Mexican vendor, or to an American vendor with Mexican operations, the bank retained three dozen engineers at Infosys, which had recently opened shop in Monterrey, Mexico.
 Such is the new outsourcing: A company in the United States pays an Indian vendor 7,000 miles away to supply it with Mexican engineers working 150 miles south of the United States border. 
 In Europe, too, companies now hire Infosys to manage back offices in their own backyards. When an American manufacturer, for instance, needed a system to handle bills from multiple vendors supplying its factories in different European countries, it turned to the Indian company. The manufacturer's different locations scan the invoices and send them to an office of Infosys, where each bill is passed to the right language team. The teams verify the orders and send the payment to the suppliers while logged in to the client's computer system. 
 More than a dozen languages are spoken at the Infosys office, which is in Brno, Czech Republic.
 The American program here in Mysore is meant to keep open that pipeline of diversity. 
 Most trainees here have no software knowledge. By teaching novices, Infosys saves money and hopes to attract workers who will turn down better-known companies for the chance to learn a new skill.
 ''It's the equivalent of a bachelor's in computer science in six months,'' said Melissa Adams, a 22-year-old trainee. Ms. Adams graduated last spring from the University of Washington with a business degree, and rejected Google for Infosys.
 And yet, even as outsourcing takes on new directions, old perceptions linger.
 For instance, when Jeff Rand, a 23-year-old American trainee, told his grandmother he was moving to India to work as a software engineer for six months, ''she said, 'Maybe I'll get to talk to you when I have a problem with my credit card.' ''
 Said Mr. Rand with a rueful chuckle, ''It took me about two or three weeks to explain to my grandma that I was not going to be working in a call center.''

HEADLINE: Big Water-Project Measure Is Approved by the Senate

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
The Senate on Monday overwhelmingly approved a bill authorizing $23 billion in water resource projects, including $3.5 billion in work for hurricane-ravaged Louisiana, despite warnings from some lawmakers and watchdog groups that the bill did not provide crucially needed changes to the Army Corps of Engineers, which would do most of the work. 
 Supporters of the measure, including Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, the chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, said it included critical projects for flood control and environmental restoration and would create a new national levee safety program with the goal of better preparedness for hurricanes. 
 ''Communities across the country have waited long enough for the vital projects in this bill,'' Ms. Boxer said. 
 But opponents, led by Senator Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, made a forceful, if futile, case that the bill would fail to address the most important needs, even in Louisiana, which is the biggest beneficiary of the measure. 
 ''After a decade of government and independent reports calling for reforming the corps and pointing out stunning flaws in corps projects and project studies, and after the tragic failures of New Orleans levees during Hurricane Katrina, the American people deserve meaningful reform,'' Mr. Feingold said in a speech on the Senate floor. ''How many more flawed projects or wasted dollars will it take before we say enough is enough?'' 
 Especially since Hurricane Katrina, the corps has been criticized as mismanaged and lacking oversight and accountability.
 The White House has said that President Bush will veto the bill because it is too expensive and stuffed with political pork. In a letter to Congressional leaders, Rob Portman, the former budget director, and John Paul Woodley Jr., the assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, noted that the Corps of Engineers already had a backlog of $38 billion in projects. They urged Congress to pass a cheaper bill. 
 While the bill authorizes projects, it does not actually provide the money for them, which must be done in a future spending bill, meaning that there is no guarantee that a given project will go forward. 
 More dire warnings came from watchdog groups and some engineering experts, who said that the bill did not ensure that the most crucially needed work in Louisiana or elsewhere would get the highest priority, and instead would allow lawmakers with the most political muscle to push their favored projects. 
 ''We are diverting our spending for the high priority projects to the political priority projects,'' said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonprofit group that monitors Congressional spending. 
 Mr. Ellis pointed to a project that would widen and deepen the Port of Iberia in Louisiana, for which the bill authorized $131 million. He said the deeper port was mostly intended to lure business from neighboring Texas. 
 ''Here is a boondoggle project in Louisiana that is then going to be siphoning away money from projects that the rest of the country knows are critical for economic and human health,'' Mr. Ellis said, adding that the money could be better spent elsewhere in Louisiana. 
 Robert G. Bea, a professor of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of an independent study on the levee failures in New Orleans, said he, too, believed the nation had to narrow its focus on the highest priorities, one of which he said was to improve existing levees and pumping stations so they could withstand a once-in-100-years storm. 
 ''Rather than trying to get everything done at once and do it poorly,'' Mr. Bea said, ''let's choose one thing that we know needs to get done and get it done right.'' 
 Ms. Boxer and other supporters, including Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, said the bill's passage by an 81 to 12 vote showed they had enough support to override a veto. They and other supporters said the bill provided for an important independent review process of some Corps of Engineering projects. 
 Ms. Boxer also said she believed all of the projects in the bill reflected high national priorities.
 ''What is a national priority when it comes to water infrastructure?'' she asked. ''We know flood control is a national priority. We know goods movement is a national priority, we know ecosystem restoration is a national priority and making sure our people have recreational opportunities around these projects.''

HEADLINE: World Bank Faces Doubt From Donors

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
Girls' schools in Bangladesh, clean water systems in Ghana, courthouses in Armenia, roads in Nicaragua. For decades, the World Bank has financed more than $10 billion a year for projects like these, the biggest source of aid for the poorest countries. 
 But continuing that aid, and perhaps increasing it, is now a major hurdle before the bank's new president, Robert B. Zoellick, who is finding that wealthy countries are balking because of their own budget problems and lingering questions after recent turmoil over the bank's relevance, its priorities and its effectiveness.
 ''It's an uphill struggle,'' Mr. Zoellick acknowledged in an interview, referring to a drive to raise money for aid to the poorest countries. ''We have put out various scenarios for increasing aid at a time when most finance ministers around the world are trying to keep their budgets even.''
 Not least among the difficulties in raising an initial $39 billion over the next three years is the atmosphere left by Paul D. Wolfowitz, the former deputy defense secretary who, as bank president, tangled with colleagues at the bank and around the world. Mr. Wolfowitz resigned in May after a furor over his ethics. 
 Mr. Wolfowitz's relations with European development officials were so strained that before he resigned, German officials warned that they would have trouble financing the bank's aid for poor countries if he stayed on. Mr. Wolfowitz is now gone, but Mr. Zoellick is facing continued resistance. 
 Japan is threatening to cut aid because of its own budget difficulties. And European countries say that they are looking at other ways to give money and that they resent that the United States, which accounts for 20 percent of the world's economic output, has slipped in its share of the burden of aiding the poor to just under 14 percent.
 Part of the reason the United States' share has declined is that the value of the dollar against European currencies has declined. Still, European resentments continue. It has also not helped Mr. Zoellick's campaign that the United States has fallen behind in meeting its past commitments to help the bank aid poor countries, by $375 million.
 ''We have an arrears problem,'' said a senior administration official, who asked not to be identified because of the awkwardness of the situation. ''The administration and the Congress are committed to this cause, but I'm sure people are wondering how strong that commitment is.''
 The bank's aid to the poorest countries is channeled through one of its divisions, the International Development Association, or I.D.A. The division's aid is in the form of grants and interest-free loans, payable over as much as 40 years, to more than 80 countries rated the poorest because their per capita income is below $1,050. About half are in Africa.
 Over the years, loans by I.D.A. have become a smaller and smaller part of the worldwide aid to poor countries from rich countries. These days, wealthier nations have increasingly preferred to channel aid to poor countries directly through their development agencies.
 Donors also prefer to earmark funds for specific purposes, like combating H.I.V. and AIDS, health care for women or environmental problems. It is easier, leaders in these countries say, to build political support at home for such specific causes, especially when the World Bank has been discredited in Europe.
 As a result, I.D.A. now accounts for about 8 percent of the worldwide aid from rich countries to poor countries. Mr. Zoellick has argued that its role is crucial because it has the staff and resources to analyze overall needs, share information, set priorities and avoid duplications and contradictions in aid programs.
 ''Trying to get huge contributions for a general fund like I.D.A. is getting harder and harder,'' Mr. Zoellick said. ''But I.D.A. has a unique benefit. In a world where there's a fragmentation of aid, I.D.A. is the unifier. It's the platform. It's the foundation. It's the glue that holds everything else together.''
 Another factor complicating Mr. Zoellick's efforts is that he has to raise more money than in the past just to keep even. To make new loans, the bank has typically relied on income from poor countries' payments on past loans. Now those repayments are no longer available; two years ago, President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain led an effort to cancel the debts of scores of poor countries. With that effort, the bank will forfeit an estimated $12 billion over the next three years in interest and principal repayment.
 To make up the difference, Mr. Zoellick is considering a plan to tap other resources within the bank. For example, he may use some of the payments from loans given to middle-income countries, or from those made to private businesses by other divisions of the bank.
 He is also customizing his sales pitch, bank officials say, by trying to persuade certain European countries, like Germany, that are interested in financing efforts to limit climate change, that they do not want to neglect aid to Africa.
 In addition, he is trying to persuade China, a recipient of bank loans, to tap some of its foreign exchange reserves, which exceed $1 trillion, to provide aid to Africa. 
 Many development officials and experts in the bank, in Europe and in private sector groups say that because he has thrown himself into the I.D.A. agenda, Mr. Zoellick has been effective at wiping away past animosities and assuaging donors' concerns.
 ''I predict that Bob Zoellick will have success,'' said Nancy Birdsall, president of the Center for Global Development, a policy organization. ''I think he will figure out how to make the Europeans who had doubts about Wolfowitz confident in his priorities.''
 Those priorities include aid to countries racked by civil war and aid to Africa in general, as well as help to slow global climate change by encouraging energy and environmental programs in poor countries.
 Europe in particular is interested in making the climate the centerpiece of the next round of I.D.A. programs, but bank officials say that African countries have begun to warn that other urgent needs, like health, are in danger of being overlooked. Mr. Zoellick has yet to reconcile these competing priorities.
 ''We still feel that Zoellick is in a listening mode,'' said a senior European development official, who asked not to be identified in order to be more candid. ''He's definitely committed and knowledgeable. But he still hasn't come out with his vision of the bank. The donor countries are still not ready to come up with large amounts of money.''
 Another senior European official, who also asked not to be identified, said: ''Zoellick still needs to make the case for I.D.A. because it is in competition with other channels for aid. But European distrust of the bank is not as high as it was earlier this year. We are waiting for him to set out a clear and compelling strategy showing that can deliver the aid effectively.''

HEADLINE: U.N. Chief Urges Fast Action On Global Climate Change

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told a meeting of world leaders on Monday that scientific evidence of the damaging global impact of climate change was sound and that the moment to act decisively was now.
 ''Today, the time for doubt has passed,'' he told delegates in the packed General Assembly hall here.
 He said that ''the scientists have very clearly outlined the severity of the problem,'' and that the world knows enough to act. Mr. Ban added that failure to act would bring ''devastating'' consequences and that affordable technologies existed to address the problem promptly. 
 The one-day meeting on climate change, with more than 150 nations participating, was organized by Mr. Ban to prepare the ground for negotiations on an agreement to succeed the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the international accord that limits the emissions of greenhouse gases.
 More than 80 heads of state and government are expected to attend this week's opening of the 62nd General Assembly session, which has adopted climate change as its central theme.
 The United States has rejected the Kyoto conclusions, and President Bush did not participate in the day's proceedings. But he attended a private dinner of government leaders from countries the United Nations calls ''major emitters'' and other nations considered most vulnerable to global warming.
 Mr. Bush, who opposes negotiated limits on greenhouse gases, has scheduled his own two-day climate meeting of 15 major industrial nations in Washington on Thursday and Friday, at which he is expected to put forth his administration's competing view that nations should be permitted to set their own limits, according to their national circumstances, rather than having them dictated by a binding treaty.
 In addition, Mr. Bush has argued that excessive environmental regulation will restrict economic growth, a notion that Mr. Ban appeared to dismiss with a comment in his end-of-the-day summary. ''The cost of inaction will far outweigh the cost of early action,'' he said.
 Speaking on the issue for the United States, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice made no mention of goals to cut greenhouse gases, but focused instead on the need for what she called ''a technological revolution.''
 ''Ultimately, we must develop and bring to market new energy technologies that transcend the current system of fossil fuels, carbon emissions and economic activity,'' she said.
 Putting forth a differing American view -- one that was similar to Mr. Ban's -- was Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Republican governor of California, who has promoted the kind of legal limits and negotiations on a global accord that the Bush administration opposes.
 ''It is time to come together in a new international agreement that can embrace the rich and poor nations alike,'' he asserted at the meeting.
 ''California,'' he pledged, ''is moving the United States beyond debate and doubt to action.''
 He said that the responsibility of all nations was ''action -- action, action, action.''
 The next step in the process spurred by the meeting is a United Nations-sponsored conference in Bali, Indonesia, in December, and Mr. Ban said he intended for it to produce ''a real breakthrough'' in the climate debate.
 Former Vice President Al Gore said at a luncheon meeting that the Bali conference ought to be followed by an emergency meeting a month later of the participating countries that would involve their heads of state, rather than just their environment ministers, to keep the high-level momentum going.
 ''We are facing a planetary emergency, one that faces all human civilization,'' said Mr. Gore, who through speeches, and his widely distributed film ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' has devoted his post-electoral career to raising awareness of climate change.
 European speakers voiced support for legally binding targets of the kind that the Bush administration has resisted.
 Hilary Benn, Britain's minister for the environment, said at a breakfast meeting of reporters that the United States had to end its opposition to mandatory limits. ''It is inconceivable that dangerous climate change can be avoided without this happening,'' he said.
 France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, speaking for the European Union, said, ''Collective action is imperative.''
 The Kyoto pact required nations to reduce heat-trapping gases emitted by power plants and other industrial and agricultural sources by 2102 an average 5 percent below what they were in 1990. The European Union has since pledged to reduce emissions by at least an additional 20 percent by 2020.

 BODY:
This was going to be a sour grapes column.
 Next week on Oct. 4, it will be 50 years since Sputnik launched the world into the so-called space age.
 Some space age. It has been 35 years since anybody was on the Moon, or more than 300 miles from Earth, for that matter. NASA says it will be 2020 before astronauts get back to the Moon, meaning that it will have taken twice as long this time from presidential declaration (Bush in 2003) to actual landing than the first time around, when President John F. Kennedy declared in 1961 that America would land on the Moon within the decade, and Apollo 11 launched eight years later. You are free to make your own guesses about Mars.
 If you're not a reporter covering the space program or a scientist who uses space instruments, you probably have never met anyone who has seen the curve of the Earth with his or her own eyes. It is as if the response to Christopher Columbus's voyage had been confined to mapping the reefs off Spain.
 It wasn't supposed to be like this. 
 When Sputnik was launched, transforming what my parents thought of as an unhealthy obsession with science fiction and all things atomic or cosmic into the stuff of patriotic heroism, my friends and I already knew how the future was supposed to unfold: Arthur C. Clarke (Sir Arthur now), Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury, among many others, had laid it all out in stories and novels that we stole from the local drug store: the space stations, the Moonbases and Mars colonies, the lonely asteroid prospectors, the nuclear wars back home, the eventual dispersal of humanity to far flung stars where Earth is only a dim legend.
 The great space visionaries like Wernher von Braun, Robert H. Goddard, Hermann Oberth and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, as well as the men and women of NASA, all drank the same Kool-Aid. But NASA, as the current administrator Michael D. Griffin will be the first to tell you, works for the president. As a result, true believers over the ages have had to hitch their wagons to whatever political star is in vogue.
 Sputnik was an almost accidental outgrowth of the arms race, as Matthew Brzezinski's new history, ''Red Moon Rising,'' makes grippingly clear. Neither Nikita S. Khrushchev nor Dwight D. Eisenhower understood at first how important and ominous that little beeping ball orbiting the Earth was. After the United States reclaimed its missile manhood by landing men on the Moon, President Richard M. Nixon had no more use for the Apollo program.
 Space aficionados have been wandering in the political wilderness ever since, looking for a way to make cosmic affairs matter again. Curiosity? It doesn't seem to be enough to loosen the purse strings these days. American economic competitiveness? A recent NASA slogan, ''NASA explores for answers that power our future,'' didn't exactly stir the blood. To escape some planetary apocalypse like an asteroid or plague? So far we can't seem to get out of our own way regarding greenhouse gases and global warming.
 I can think of many much worse ways than space exploration to put my tax dollars to work, but the space dream has been dead for me since the early 1980s, when I chanced to see a particular photograph of a shuttle launching. The photo was taken from a chase plane. It shows a tower of smoke rising upward from the Earth's surface, which is blurred by the haze of altitude and clouds. Near the tower's glowing top, like a pinhead on Jack's beanstalk, is the space shuttle, dwarfed by its own plume, roaring away as hard as it can.
 There, on a pillar of violence, is your dream of transcendence, of freedom, of escape from killer rocks in the sky, boiling oceans or whatever postmodern plague science comes up with. Of galactic immortality.
 That picture broke my heart. I'd seen rocket launches before and been appropriately chastened by the thunder and heat it took to break free of gravity, but I had never seen it from such a perspective. So much work for such a small step into the universe. How could this ever be routine, economical or safe?
 Don't get me wrong. In the long run, humans or their successors have no choice but to get out there where the asteroids and cosmic rays roam. The Earth, after all, is doomed to boil in a billion or so years.
 Recently I sent an e-mail message to Sir Arthur asking him how he felt about the progress, or lack thereof, in space exploration since Sputnik. In addition to being a visionary writer, he invented the idea of the communications satellite, and for the last few decades has been plugging the idea of a space elevator, which could haul people and things nonviolently to geosynchronous orbit, 22,240 miles high, perhaps with superstrong nanotubes. He was encouraged by the prospects of such a contraption and the advent of what he called ''citizen astronauts.''
 ''I remain optimistic that the best is yet to come,'' he wrote from Sri Lanka.
 In fact, the last 50 years haven't all been a letdown. Science, despite being relegated to the tail end of NASA's budget, has begun to illuminate space and the universe to a degree no one imagined, probably because none of my sci-fi gurus foresaw Moore's Law, by which the capabilities of computer chips have doubled every year and a half.
 Who dreamed that space would be peppered with black holes popping off X-rays? Who dreamed that you could have a baby picture of the universe when it was only 400,000 years old and a seething fireball? Spy satellites have allowed the United States and Russia to take the first timid steps backward from atomic catastrophe -- surely that deserves a Nobel Prize for some spook somewhere. 
 As I write this, the Mars Phoenix lander is approaching Mars with, among other things, the names of 250,000 Earthlings, including those of my wife and daughter. Voyager 1 is leaving the solar system with a recording of Beethoven, Chuck Berry, whale songs and the sound of a kiss, among other things. It won't be long before space probes are carrying genome sequences and even genes.
 In this context the grapes don't seem so sour to me (although there is a lot more science they could be doing).
 Our machines have gone ahead of us. But someday people will hike through the canyons of Mars. I just don't know when or how or who. Maybe it will be the Chinese, who seem to still feel that they have something to prove as a nation. Maybe it will be billionaire adventurers -- like the Google founders who just put up a $25 million prize for the first private Moon lander, who are free to risk their own money and don't have to answer to Congress when things go wrong, as they sometimes will -- who make the dream come true, for at least a few.
 There will always be someone willing to ride a pillar of fire into the unknown, but it won't be me. I don't want to go to Mars anymore. I no longer have the stuff -- if in fact I ever did -- to camp out in a tin can for two years. I'd be afraid to be so far from the Earth and my family for so long.
 I don't want my daughter to go either, for the same reason. When our children do go off forever across the void then we will have a chance to find out if we are as strong as our ancestors who bundled their children onto ships in the hope they would reach a better world across the ocean. Someday, somebody will go and not come back, and humans will have escaped their nest, for better or for worse.
 There is no galactic immortality. Everything we are and have done, the whole Milky Way with its billions of stars, is eventually destined to be swallowed up in a black hole. Neither ourselves nor our works will survive the end of the universe, if dark energy eventually blows it apart, no matter what we do. All we own is the present, so it behooves each of us to live each moment impeccably, guided by whatever lights we choose. Speaking only for myself, while we are around we might as well embrace the light and the unknown, the violence and vastness that terrify us.
 My sci-fi dreams are dead, but Sir Richard Branson and his fellow space entrepreneurs say they have business plans. If Mr. Branson manages to get the cosmologist Stephen Hawking into space and back, he will have done more for the cause of space exploration than 25 years of space shuttles going around in circles. 
 Watching the Apollo astronauts recount their travels to the Moon in the documentary ''In the Shadow of the Moon,'' I was wiping away tears for a time when we had bold dreams and leaders who, for whatever motives, could make them happen. Neil Armstrong's footprints on the Moon are as crisp as the day he made them.
 I will always be glad I was alive when he took that small step, even if we are still waiting for the next big leap.

HEADLINE: In Argentina, the Campaign of 'Queen Cristina' Focuses on Global Relations

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
With just over a month to go before voters will choose a new president of Argentina, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, or ''Queen Cristina,'' as she is widely known here, is living up to her nickname. 
 Over the past two months, Mrs. Kirchner, a senator in Buenos Aires and wife of President Nestor Kirchner, has been treating her attempt to become Argentina's first elected female president more like a coronation than a campaign. 
 With a healthy lead of at least 25 percentage points over her closest rival, Mrs. Kirchner has all but eschewed photo-ops with actual Argentines here in favor of coverage abroad with foreign bankers, dignitaries and international investors in Europe and the United States. 
 In the past two months she has piled up frequent-flier miles in trips to Mexico, Spain, Austria and Germany. This week she is in New York, where her husband is scheduled to speak at the United Nations. 
 Mrs. Kirchner's focus on international relations has drawn criticism from opponents and others who say she is conveniently ignoring a number of serious domestic problems that threaten to carry over for her husband's successor, no matter who wins the election. 
 ''There is a risk she will be so captivated by international politics and foreign relations that she will avoid the mounting problems in Argentina,'' said Michael Shifter, vice president for policy at Inter-American Dialogue in Washington, a research group focusing on Latin America.
 Among those issues likely to plague the next president are energy shortfalls, a shrinking budget surplus and a ballooning inflation rate that several independent economists say is now over 15 percent -- almost twice what official government statistics show. 
 The heavy foreign travel schedule is part of a calculated strategy by the Kirchners to start the second phase of a shared presidency. Elected in 2003 with only 22 percent of the vote during the depths of Argentina's financial crisis, Mr. Kirchner focused primarily on domestic politics and allowed relations with the United States and crucial European allies to wither. 
 Despite the success of his administration in turning around the economy, he chose not to run again and instead make way for his wife. Rather than risk lame-duck status during his second term, analysts say, the couple decided they could essentially tag-team the presidency for at least 12 more years. Argentine presidents are limited to two consecutive four-year terms but, unlike the United States, they can seek to run again four years after exiting the Pink House, the Argentine presidential palace. 
 While no one has pulled it off before, the Kirchners stand a strong chance. Mr. Kirchner once had an approval rating of almost 80 percent, and opinion polls in the past few months showed that he still commanded more than 50 percent support despite a number of recent corruption scandals. The main reason is the economy, which has rebounded from the 2002 depths and grown by 8 percent in each of the last three years. 
 Hailing from the university town of La Plata, outside of Buenos Aires, Mrs. Kirchner, 54, is a lawyer and polished speaker known for her strong personality and a solid human rights record that dates to her time as a senator in her husband's Patagonian state of Santa Cruz.
 Many Argentines, however, see her as bossy and authoritarian. Those who have had private meetings with her say she lectures more than she listens. She told the journalist Olga Wornut, author of ''Queen Cristina,'' that she actually liked the nickname, which dates to her days in Santa Cruz. 
 Her fascination with traveling and international affairs, in contrast to her husband, is genuine, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director for Human Rights Watch. ''She enjoys playing in the big leagues and has a big-picture approach,'' Mr. Vivanco said. 
 ''Argentina under Cristina Kirchner is going to develop a very visible foreign policy,'' Mr. Vivanco added. ''If she finds the angle, I don't think she will be shy to actively engage Argentina in difficult human rights cases like the Sudan or Burma.'' 
 Mrs. Kirchner traveled to Venezuela this year and was instrumental in diluting the tension between the Jewish community there and President Hugo Chavez, who has made many Jews nervous because of his close relationship with Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mr. Vivanco said. 
 She is also comfortable on the dais. In recent weeks she has spoken at a number of business forums, seeking to convince foreign investors that Argentina had put its financial house in order. On her recent trip to Germany she met with bankers and toured a Volkswagen car plant. 
 On Monday she gave a speech on human rights and global justice before 450 people at New York University School of Law. On Wednesday she and her husband will have a private meeting with former President Bill Clinton in Manhattan. On Friday she will meet with Tzipi Livni, the Israeli minister for foreign affairs. 
 The traveling and mingling with the foreign elite has drawn withering criticism at home from her rivals. 
 ''Those who leave their country before an election do so because they cannot connect with the people in their own country,'' said Elisa Carrio, a center-left member of Congress who is running a distant second to Mrs. Kirchner in polls, with at most 15 percent of the vote. ''You have to demonstrate your leadership inside the country, make contact with the people. Don't use the position of first lady to make an election campaign.'' 
 Despite her apparent discomfort mingling with the masses, Mrs. Kirchner has not felt threatened by any candidate. Other than Ms. Carrio, her opponents include a former economy minister, Roberto Lavagna, and a free-market economist, Ricardo Lopez Murphy.
 The opposition is so weak that Mrs. Kirchner has been able to all but ignore the Argentine news media, choosing to give select interviews to journalists abroad. 
 ''There is no political debate in this country right now,'' said Walter Curia, an editor at the newspaper Clarin and author of ''The Last Peronist,'' a study of Mr. Kirchner. ''The only debate is within the walls of the Pink House.''
 Mrs. Kirchner seems less interested in emulating Eva Peron, the powerful and beloved first lady of President Juan Peron, than she is her idol, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Both are lawyers with husbands who hailed from political backwaters and became president, though Mrs. Kirchner has been quick to point out that she was elected a senator before her husband began his career in politics. 
 Analysts speculate that Argentina's relationship with the United States could improve if she and Mrs. Clinton were both elected. The two have met twice, at Mrs. Kirchner's request, once in Washington in 2003, where the discussion focused on the unsolved bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994, and again at the Democratic National Convention in Boston in 2004. Mrs. Kirchner has even appeared to steal a page from Mrs. Clinton, reportedly putting together a health care reform plan as part of her domestic agenda. 
 Mrs. Kirchner might learn a lesson from Mrs. Clinton's image makeover, said Mr. Shifter of Inter-American Dialogue. As first lady, Mrs. Clinton was seen by many as bossy and abrasive. Her experience on a ''listening tour'' in New York state during her Senate campaign, by some accounts, softened that image. ''It was humbling and effective,'' Mr. Shifter said. ''Cristina could probably benefit from something like that. Humility is not her strength.''

HEADLINE: The Mayor's Spending

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Mayor Preaches Frugality but Uses Windfall'' (front page, Sept. 17), about Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's spending record, reports a 23 percent increase in New York City's budget since Mayor Bloomberg took office and an 8 percent increase during Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's eight years, adjusted for inflation. 
 These figures accurately describe the growth in expenditures as reported by the city for accounting purposes. But two anomalies in those figures distort the real underlying growth in the budget. 
 First, the city has a habit of paying debt service early in order to shift surplus funds from one year to another. In 2002, this practice artificially reduced the city's reported spending. 
 Second, in 2007, Mayor Bloomberg set aside $1.5 billion for the city's future liability for retiree health insurance. This laudable action counts as increased spending, even though it is fairer to think of it as a reserve for future obligations. 
 Adjusting for these factors, budget growth to date under Mayor Bloomberg has been 13 percent.

HEADLINE: Albany's Real Work

 BODY:
When Albany's district attorney cleared Gov. Eliot Spitzer's administration of breaking any laws in ''troopergate,'' it should have been a calming moment. Instead, the exoneration generated more shouting. The loudest were from state Republicans, who want to keep this scandal alive because it has tarnished Mr. Spitzer's once-sterling image. Democrats were not far behind, grousing about Republican senators wasting time and up to $500,000 in taxpayer funds for yet another investigation into well-trod material. 
 Ordinary citizens are left yearning for an adult to step in and remind the state's lawmakers of two things. First, Mr. Spitzer is not off the hook because the new Public Integrity Commission, the most important body looking into the matter, has yet to conclude its investigation. Also, while waiting for the final ruling -- which could take a while -- all this chest-thumping is not a substitute for doing state work that really matters.
 Mr. Spitzer and his aides have been accused of misusing State Police in an effort to get incriminating information about the use of state aircraft by State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, New York's top elected Republican. Albany County District Attorney P. David Soares concluded last week, as Attorney General Andrew Cuomo already had, that no laws were broken. Mr. Soares did not say whether the governor and his staff had done anything unwise or unethical. That, he explained correctly, was not his job.
 That falls to the integrity commission, headed by John Feerick, the former dean of Fordham Law School. The commission is expected to be thorough, but also to take time. While it investigates, there is no need for the State Senate to conduct its own politicized hearings.
 The list of items moldering on the table in Albany is already too long. New York needs real campaign finance reform, a genuine economic plan instead of the annual handouts to political friends and a pay increase for judges, to name just a few pressing matters. Bills that would get these things done are a lot harder to write than outraged press releases but, for regular New Yorkers, they are far more important.

HEADLINE: Deadly Road Crashes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 We commend Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg for his $9 million gift to the World Health Organization to combat the growing global epidemic of road crashes. As your Sept. 17 news article notes, crashes kill nearly 1.2 million people and injure 50 million more each year. They are the leading cause of death for healthy Americans abroad and consume 1 percent to 4 percent of the G.D.P. 
 The hidden costs in pain and suffering are unquantifiable. Yet road crashes are preventable.
 The United Nations has called on member states, nongovernmental organizations and citizens of the world to act. The World Health Organization is coordinating the efforts of a network of road safety groups worldwide, including the Association for Safe International Road Travel. 
 The association, founded in 1995 in response to the death of 25-year-old Aron Sobel in a bus crash in Turkey, works to improve global road safety by educating travelers about road conditions and cultures and by supporting sustainable road safety partnerships abroad. 
 Mayor Bloomberg's gift to the W.H.O. will make a difference.

HEADLINE: That Long-Awaited Peace Meeting

 BODY:
We welcome President Bush's decision to include Syria on the list of countries invited to a November Middle East peace meeting. The president's distaste for such efforts -- aides still balk at the term ''peace conference'' -- is only slightly less visceral than his distaste for Syria. We hope this means that Mr. Bush and his aides are finally ready to push all sides to make the compromises essential for moving toward an Israeli-Palestinian peace. 
 If Damascus chooses not to attend the meeting, it would again confirm its role as one of the region's dangerous spoilers. If it chooses to come, the chances for peace may increase. The invitation will certainly make it easier for Egypt and Saudi Arabia -- whose political and economic support for any Israel-Palestinian agreement is crucial -- to be there. Mr. Bush will still probably have to twist the arms of the risk-averse Saudis to show up.
 As for why this sudden flexibility from the White House? The conventional wisdom is that Mr. Bush's secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, wants to try and salvage the president's legacy -- and her own -- with a peace deal that could help stabilize the region that Mr. Bush's war in Iraq has so destructively roiled. It will take a lot more creative diplomacy to make that happen. Indeed, six trips into a too-little, too-late peace effort, Ms. Rice is having as much trouble making progress with Israel, America's close ally, as with Palestinians. 
 Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is insisting that the meeting produce a full declaration on the most sensitive and difficult issues: borders, Jerusalem and when the Palestinians get the independent state that President Bush promised them five years ago. Israel, concerned that Mr. Abbas is too weak to guarantee Israel's security but unwilling to do more to strengthen him, has made clear it is interested in much smaller steps.
 Ms. Rice insists she is not looking to stage just another photo op, but has largely left it to the Israelis and Palestinians to work out the joint statement expected to emerge from the November meeting. She's going to have to roll up her sleeves a lot more to prove her diplomatic mettle. And President Bush is going to have to be personally and directly involved.
 A full-scale peace agreement may be unrealistic, but Ms. Rice should aim to have the two sides sign a formal document laying out in as much detail as possible a framework for resolving the core issues of borders, refugees and the status of Jerusalem. 
 America's recent record in the Middle East is one of failure -- in Iraq, in promoting genuine democracy, in stopping Iran from spreading its brand of militant Islam at odds with the West. The region doesn't need another failure nor does America's tattered reputation. All sides need to come away from the November meeting feeling that something concrete has changed in the Middle East -- and finally for the better.

HEADLINE: A Reversal In the Index Of Happy

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: Leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Last year, a team of researchers added a novel twist to something known as a time-use survey. Instead of simply asking people what they had done over the course of their day, as pollsters have been doing since the 1960s, the researchers also asked how people felt during each activity. Were they happy? Interested? Tired? Stressed? 
 Not surprisingly, men and women often gave similar answers about what they liked to do (hanging out with friends) and didn't like (paying bills). But there were also a number of activities that produced very different reactions from the two sexes -- and one of them really stands out: Men apparently enjoy being with their parents, while women find time with their mom and dad to be slightly less pleasant than doing laundry.
 Alan Krueger, a Princeton economist working with four psychologists on the time-use research team, figures that there is a simple explanation for the difference. For a woman, time with her parents often resembles work, whether it's helping them pay bills or plan a family gathering. ''For men, it tends to be sitting on the sofa and watching football with their dad,'' said Mr. Krueger, who, when not crunching data, enjoys watching the New York Giants with his father. 
 This intriguing -- if unsettling -- finding is part of a larger story: there appears to be a growing happiness gap between men and women. 
 Two new research papers, using very different methods, have both come to this conclusion. Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers, economists at the University of Pennsylvania (and a couple), have looked at the traditional happiness data, in which people are simply asked how satisfied they are with their overall lives. In the early 1970s, women reported being slightly happier than men. Today, the two have switched places.
 Mr. Krueger, analyzing time-use studies over the last four decades, has found an even starker pattern. Since the 1960s, men have gradually cut back on activities they find unpleasant. They now work less and relax more. 
 Over the same span, women have replaced housework with paid work -- and, as a result, are spending almost as much time doing things they don't enjoy as in the past. Forty years ago, a typical woman spent about 23 hours a week in an activity considered unpleasant, or 40 more minutes than a typical man. Today, with men working less, the gap is 90 minutes. 
 These trends are reminiscent of the idea of ''the second shift,'' the name of a 1989 book by the sociologist Arlie Hochschild, arguing that modern women effectively had to hold down two jobs. The first shift was at the office, and the second at home.
 But researchers who have looked at time-use data say the second-shift theory misses an important detail. Women are not actually working more than they were 30 or 40 years ago. They are instead doing different kinds of work. They're spending more time on paid work and less on cleaning and cooking. 
 What has changed -- and what seems to be the most likely explanation for the happiness trends -- is that women now have a much longer to-do list than they once did (including helping their aging parents). They can't possibly get it all done, and many end up feeling as if they are somehow falling short.
 Mr. Krueger's data, for instance, shows that the average time devoted to dusting has fallen significantly in recent decades. There haven't been any dust-related technological breakthroughs, so houses are probably just dirtier than they used to be. I imagine that the new American dustiness affects women's happiness more than men's. 
 Ms. Stevenson was recently having drinks with a business school graduate who came up with a nice way of summarizing the problem. Her mother's goals in life, the student said, were to have a beautiful garden, a well-kept house and well-adjusted children who did well in school. ''I sort of want all those things, too,'' the student said, as Ms. Stevenson recalled, ''but I also want to have a great career and have an impact on the broader world.''
 It's telling that there is also a happiness gap between boys and girls in high school. As life has generally gotten better over the last generation -- less crime, longer-living grandparents and much cooler gadgets -- male high school seniors have gotten happier. About 25 percent say they are very satisfied with their lives, up from 16 percent in 1976. Roughly 22 percent of senior girls now give that answer, unchanged from the 1970s.
 When Ms. Stevenson and I were talking last week about possible explanations, she mentioned her ''hottie theory.'' It's based on an April article in this newspaper by Sara Rimer, about a group of incredibly impressive teenage girls in Newton, Mass. The girls were getting better grades than the boys, playing varsity sports, helping to run the student government and doing community service. Yet one girl who had gotten a perfect 2,400 on her college entrance exams noted that she and her friends still felt pressure to be ''effortlessly hot.''
 As Ms. Stevenson, who's 36, said: ''When I was in high school, it was clear being a hottie was the most important thing, and it's not that it's any less important today. It's that other things have become more important. And, frankly, people spent a lot of time trying to be a hottie when I was in high school. So I don't know where they find the time today.''
 The two new papers -- Mr. Krueger's will be published in the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity and the Stevenson-Wolfers one is still in draft form -- are part of a burst of happiness research in recent years. There is no question that the research has its limitations. Happiness, of course, is highly subjective. 
 A big reason that women reported being happier three decades ago -- despite far more discrimination -- is probably that they had narrower ambitions, Ms. Stevenson says. Many compared themselves only to other women, rather than to men as well. This doesn't mean they were better off back then. 
 But it does show just how incomplete the gender revolution has been. Although women have flooded into the work force, American society hasn't fully come to grips with the change. The United States still doesn't have universal preschool, and, in contrast to other industrialized countries, there is no guaranteed paid leave for new parents. 
 Government policy isn't the only problem, either. Inside of families, men still haven't figured out how to shoulder their fair share of the household burden. Instead, we're spending more time on the phone and in front of the television. 
 This weekend, I think I may volunteer to do a little dusting.

HEADLINE: Benefits and Traps In New Tax Rules

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
LIKE fishermen who keep watch on the weather report, smart business owners stay apprised of Washington's ever-changing tax and regulatory climate for developments that could affect their profits. 
 Two important events have occurred so far this year: on May 25, President Bush signed the Small Business and Work Opportunity Tax Act, and on Aug. 3, the Internal Revenue Service proposed regulations on the employee benefit plans known as cafeteria plans. 
 CAFETERIA PLANS For many businesses, the I.R.S. action will be the more significant of the two events. Susan Relland, a benefits specialist with the Washington law firm Miller & Chevalier, said, ''Every employer that offers a cafeteria plan has to revise all their plan documents.'' 
 Cafeteria plans allow employees to make choices regarding a variety of benefits, including life, health and disability insurance; health and dependent care flexible spending accounts; and sometimes contributions to a 401(k) plan. ''This brings everything together in one organized set of rules,'' Ms. Relland said. Although the effective date of the regulations is Jan. 1, 2009, she said companies could begin operating under them right away, because the I.R.S. has already withdrawn the previous rules. 
 She said that one of the more important changes prevents plans from favoring top management. ''It seems from the nondiscrimination rules you have to have one plan for everyone,'' she said. A restaurant chain, for example, could not have one health plan for executives and another for workers in the restaurants. 
 And, Ms. Relland said, ''the regulations explicitly state that sole proprietors, partners, directors of corporations and 2 percent shareholders of S corporations cannot participate. They can sponsor a plan for their employees but cannot participate.'' 
 The regulations are not final, however, and business owners have until Nov. 5 to comment. The I.R.S. will hold a public hearing on Nov. 15. ''I would very much encourage comment,'' Ms. Relland said. 
 EXPENSING LIMITS Despite its promising name, much of the Small Business and Work Opportunity Tax Act is technical and targeted narrowly. ''The most significant provision is the increased expensing limit for 2007 through 2010,'' said Barbara Weltman, a tax lawyer in Millwood, N.Y., and author of ''J. K. Lasser's Small Business Taxes 2007.'' 
 Expensing means that businesses can take an immediate tax deduction when they buy qualifying equipment rather than depreciating it over several years. In 2003, Congress quadrupled the former limit of $25,000 to $100,000, and that has been tweaked in recent years. The latest increase is to $125,000 for 2007 from $112,000. The limit will be indexed for inflation through 2010. 
 The multiyear provision of this year's act will help businesses plan, Ms. Weltman said. A business could decide, say, whether it would be more advantageous to buy a new computer system before the end of this year, or to wait a year or so. ''It's very challenging for a small business to do any strategic planning with uncertainty,'' she said. 
 OTHER PROVISIONS Mark Luscombe, a lawyer and principal tax analyst at CCH, which publishes books and software for tax professionals, cited several other benefits from the act. 
 One is simplified tax reporting for family businesses. In the past, a couple who were in business together were supposed to file as a partnership, but to simplify tax filing, many let one spouse report the business income as a sole proprietor. Now each spouse can file a Schedule C with Form 1040, reporting a share of the income. That means both pay Social Security tax, so ''both will collect down the line.'' 
 The act extends the Work Opportunity Tax Credit through Aug. 31, 2011, and expands it, letting businesses claim tax credits for hiring certain employees, up to $4,800 each. The employees, Mr. Luscombe said, include certain veterans and workers ages 18 to 25 from areas with few employment opportunities. 
 The act also gives restaurant owners a tax break on the tip credit, Mr. Luscombe said. Restaurant owners pay Social Security and Medicare tax on tips that are treated as part of the minimum wage. Although Congress has raised the minimum wage, to $7.25 an hour over two years, restaurant owners can base the tax on the old minimum, $5.15. 
 KIDDIE TAX To raise the nearly $5 billion needed annually for the small-business act, Congress widened the kiddie tax, under which investment income held in the name of children is taxed at their parents' rate. Beginning next year, the provision will apply to all children under age 19 and to students under age 24. The rules do not apply to earned income, which can still be taxed at a child's lower rate. 
 ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX The tax denies many breaks, like the deduction for state and local income and real estate taxes, so it is particularly onerous to people who own both businesses and homes. It also taxes some income that is exempt from regular taxes, like interest on private-purpose municipal bonds. 
 Tax professionals generally expect Congress to again enact a one-year patch to limit the effect of the alternative minimum tax on the upper-middle class, but it has not done so yet.

HEADLINE: Banks Urging U.S. to Adopt The Trading Of Emissions

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
A group representing some of the world's leading banks will urge the United States and other industrial nations this week to move quickly to introduce a lightly regulated system for trading carbon emissions permits. 
 Permit-trading systems offer banks a potentially vast new business. For it to grow, leading economies -- particularly the United States -- will need to set limits on the quantities of greenhouse gases that can be released and to allow companies in other parts of the world to buy emissions permits.
 ''Where politicians opt to implement carbon constraints, then it should be cap-and-trade,'' said Imtiaz Ahmad, head of emissions trading at Morgan Stanley in London and vice president of a lobbying group called International Carbon Investors and Services, which is being created to represent the banks.
 The banking companies, which include Citigroup, Lehman Brothers Holdings and Morgan Stanley, are giving strong signs that Wall Street wants Washington to open the way to reduced emissions using a trading system based on the Kyoto Protocol, an agreement the United States did not ratify, rather than by enacting carbon taxes.
 The group also includes European institutions like BNP Paribas, Barclays Capital and Deutsche Bank, as well as niche investment banks like Climate Change Capital and the law firms of Baker & McKenzie and DLA Piper.
 A Kyoto-style trading system already operates in the European Union, where governments limit the polluting emissions that industries are allowed and require purchases of permits for any excess. But the European system had a rocky start. Overallocation led to volatility and a collapse in the price of permits last year.
 Even though analysts say the European overallocation problem has largely been corrected, the banks are pushing for the European Union to auction permits to ensure that they are scarcer and costlier. The banks want any comparable American system to establish a maximum price for carbon permits.
 ''Price caps should play a very limited role in the system,'' said Gia Schneider, a vice president for carbon markets at Credit Suisse, which is a member of the lobbying group. ''Such policies could lead to market distortions and stymie efforts to raise enough capital to fund new energy technologies such as windmills and solar power.''
 The idea of price caps has been floated by Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, who has suggested a so-called safety valve provision to prevent the price of carbon trading from rising too high.
 Carbon traders say emissions permits could become the world's largest commodities market if developed economies agree to take part in second-phase Kyoto negotiations, to be held in Bali, Indonesia, in December.

HEADLINE: Towns Rethink Laws Against Illegal Immigrants

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and JILL P. CAPUZZO

DATELINE: RIVERSIDE, N.J., Sept. 25 

 BODY:
A little more than a year ago, the Township Committee in this faded factory town became the first municipality in New Jersey to enact legislation penalizing anyone who employed or rented to an illegal immigrant. 
 Within months, hundreds, if not thousands, of recent immigrants from Brazil and other Latin American countries had fled. The noise, crowding and traffic that had accompanied their arrival over the past decade abated. 
 The law had worked. Perhaps, some said, too well.
 With the departure of so many people, the local economy suffered. Hair salons, restaurants and corner shops that catered to the immigrants saw business plummet; several closed. Once-boarded-up storefronts downtown were boarded up again. 
 Meanwhile, the town was hit with two lawsuits challenging the law. Legal bills began to pile up, straining the town's already tight budget. Suddenly, many people -- including some who originally favored the law -- started having second thoughts.
 So last week, the town rescinded the ordinance, joining a small but growing list of municipalities nationwide that have begun rethinking such laws as their legal and economic consequences have become clearer.
 ''I don't think people knew there would be such an economic burden,'' said Mayor George Conard, who voted for the original ordinance. ''A lot of people did not look three years out.''
 In the past two years, more than 30 towns nationwide have enacted laws intended to address problems attributed to illegal immigration, from overcrowded housing and schools to overextended police forces. Most of those laws, like Riverside's, called for fines and even jail sentences for people who knowingly rented apartments to illegal immigrants or who gave them jobs. 
 In some places, business owners have objected to crackdowns that have driven away immigrant customers. And in many, ordinances have come under legal assault by immigration groups and the American Civil Liberties Union. 
 In June, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction against a housing ordinance in Farmers Branch, Tex., that would have imposed fines against landlords who rented to illegal immigrants. In July, the city of Valley Park, Mo., repealed a similar ordinance, after an earlier version was struck down by a state judge and a revision brought new challenges. A week later, a federal judge struck down ordinances in Hazleton, Pa., the first town to enact laws barring illegal immigrants from working or renting homes there. 
 Muzaffar A. Chishti, director of the New York office of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonprofit group, said Riverside's decision to repeal its law -- which was never enforced -- was clearly influenced by the Hazleton ruling, and he predicted that other towns would follow suit. 
 ''People in many towns are now weighing the social, economic and legal costs of pursuing these ordinances,'' he said.
 Indeed, Riverside, a town of 8,000 nestled across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, has already spent $82,000 defending its ordinance, and it risked having to pay the plaintiffs' legal fees if it lost in court. The legal battle forced the town to delay road paving projects, the purchase of a dump truck and repairs to town hall, officials said. But while Riverside's about-face may repair its budget, it may take years to mend the emotional scars that formed when the ordinance ''put us on the national map in a bad way,'' Mr. Conard said.
 Rival advocacy groups in the immigration debate turned this otherwise sleepy town into a litmus test for their causes. As the television cameras rolled, Riverside was branded, in turns, a racist enclave and a town fighting for American values.
 Some residents who backed the ban last year were reluctant to discuss their stance now, though they uniformly blamed outsiders for misrepresenting their motives. By and large, they said the ordinance was a success because it drove out illegal immigrants, even if it hurt the town's economy.
 ''It changed the face of Riverside a little bit,'' said Charles Hilton, the former mayor who pushed for the ordinance. (He was voted out of office last fall but said it was not because he had supported the law.) 
 ''The business district is fairly vacant now, but it's not the legitimate businesses that are gone,'' he said. ''It's all the ones that were supporting the illegal immigrants, or, as I like to call them, the criminal aliens.''
 Many businesses that remain are having a hard time. Angelina Guedes, a Brazilian-born beautician, opened A Touch From Brazil, a hair and nail salon, on Scott Street two years ago to cater to the immigrant population. At one point, she had 10 workers.
 Business quickly dried up after the law against illegal immigrants. Last week, on what would usually be a busy Thursday afternoon, Ms. Guedes ate a salad and gave a friend a manicure, while the five black stylist chairs sat empty.
 ''Now I only have myself,'' said Ms. Guedes, 41, speaking a mixture of Spanish and Portuguese. ''They all left. I also want to leave but it's not possible because no one wants to buy my business.''
 Numerous storefronts on Scott Street are boarded up or are empty, with For Sale by Owner signs in the windows. Business is down by half at Luis Ordonez's River Dance Music Store, which sells Western Union wire transfers, cellphones and perfume. Next door, his restaurant, the Scott Street Family Cafe, which has a multiethnic menu in English, Spanish and Portuguese, was empty at lunchtime.
 ''I came here looking for an opportunity to open a business and I found it, and the people also needed the service,'' said Mr. Ordonez, who is from Ecuador. ''It was crowded and everybody was trying to do their best to support their families.''
 Some have adapted better than others. Bruce Behmke opened the R & B Laundromat in 2003 after he saw immigrants hauling trash bags full of clothing to a laundry a mile away. Sales took off at his small shop, where want ads in Portuguese are pinned to a corkboard and copies of the Brazilian Voice sit near the door.
 When sales plummeted last year, Mr. Behmke started a wash-and-fold delivery service for young professionals.
 ''It became a ghost town here,'' he said. 
 Immigration is not new to Riverside. Once a summer resort for Philadelphians, the town became a magnet a century ago for European immigrants drawn to its factories, including the Philadelphia Watch Case Company, whose empty hulk still looms over town. Until the 1930s, the minutes of the school board meetings were recorded in German and English.
 ''There's always got to be some scapegoats,'' said Regina Collinsgru, who runs The Positive Press, a local newspaper, and whose husband was among a wave of Portuguese immigrants who came here in the 1960s. ''The Germans were first, there were problems when the Italians came, then the Polish came. That's the nature of a lot of small towns.''
 Immigrants from Latin America began arriving around 2000. The majority were Brazilians attracted not only by construction jobs in the booming housing market but also by the presence of Portuguese-speaking businesses in town. Between 2000 and 2006, local business owners and officials estimate, more than 3,000 immigrants arrived. There are no authoritative figures about the number of immigrants who were -- or were not -- in the country legally. 
 Like those waves of earlier immigrants, the Brazilians and Latinos triggered conflicting reactions. Some shopkeepers loved the extra dollars spent on Scott and Pavilion Streets, the modest thoroughfares that anchor downtown. Yet some residents steered clear of stores where Portuguese and Spanish were plainly the language of choice. A few contractors benefited from the new pool of cheap labor. Others begrudged being undercut by rivals who hired undocumented workers.
 On the town's leafy side streets, some residents admired the pluck of newcomers who often worked six days a week, and a few even took up Capoeira, the Brazilian martial art. Yet many neighbors loathed the white vans with out-of-state plates and ladders on top parked in spots they had long considered their own. The Brazilian flags that flew at several houses rankled more than a few longtime residents.
 It is unclear whether the Brazilian and Latino immigrants who left will now return to Riverside. With the housing market slowing, there may be little reason to come back. But if they do, some residents say they may spark new tensions.
 Mr. Hilton, the former mayor, said some of the illegal immigrants have already begun filtering back into town. ''It's not the Wild West like it was,'' he said, ''but it may return to that.''

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The High Costs of Ethanol'' (editorial, Sept. 19):
 Since ethanol from sugar cane is a proven technology (Brazil is so successful with it), the United States should be pursuing this, not corn-based ethanol, which, as you note, is not economically and environmentally viable. 
 Couldn't the United States grow significant amounts of sugar cane throughout the Gulf Coast regions and even in Hawaii? Or is the corn lobby blocking this?

HEADLINE: The Despotism Formerly Known as Burma

 BODY:
By dispatching troops into the streets and imposing a curfew, Myanmar's cruel military junta has set the stage for a serious clash with pro-democracy activists. A firm and united international response along the lines outlined by President Bush and the European Union at the United Nations yesterday offers the best hope of encouraging peaceful change in a nation that has endured a 19-year reign of fear. The question is whether the countries with the greatest influence on Myanmar's generals -- China, Russia and India, which all sell weapons to the army, as well as the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that are Myanmar's immediate neighbors -- have the good sense to condemn the repression and exert the pressures only they can wield with any hope of positive effect. It is essential that they step up to the plate, and fast, before blood is spilled. 
 Peaceful protests that began last month over dramatically increased fuel prices became seriously threatening to the junta when Myanmar's highly revered Buddhist monks joined in. The growing crowds gave voice to pent-up grievances -- and the junta responded in a predictable, entirely wrongheaded way. It sent troops into the streets, and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the iconic democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, was reported to have been moved to prison from house arrest. 
 The United States, which has long had sanctions on Myanmar, including an import ban, will now expand a visa ban against regime leaders and tighten financial penalties, Mr. Bush told the United Nations. Although not spelled out, the plan is believed to include going after regime bank accounts in Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries, a tactic used by Washington with some effect against North Korea. The European Union also warned the junta that it faced tougher sanctions if it used force to crush the pro-democracy movement.
 These were good and necessary moves, but the greatest leverage to forestall disaster lies with China, Russia and India, who are making money off the junta and enabling it to stay in power. China, Myanmar's chief trade partner and the host of the 2008 Olympic Games, has beefed up arms sales to Yangon, formerly Rangoon, prompting Russia and India to do likewise as a way of offsetting Beijing's influence. 
 Moscow has discussed providing the junta with a nuclear research reactor, and India -- the democracy on which the United States hopes to build a key security and economic relationship for the 21st century -- had a senior minister in Myanmar for energy talks, even as the democracy protests were under way. 
 There are some signs that China has urged restraint, but more must be done, including supporting U.N. sanctions on Myanmar that Beijing and Moscow have so far blocked. The U.N. envoy dealing with Myanmar, Ibrahmim Gambari, must aggressively rally these major countries, as well as the Asean nations, to persuade the generals to stand down.

HEADLINE: Insurers Want U.S. to Curb Competitors' Fund Transfers to Bermuda

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON and JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Some of the nation's biggest insurance companies will urge the Senate Finance Committee today to change rules that enable some of their competitors to avoid billions of dollars in federal taxes by sending money to themselves in Bermuda and other tax havens. 
 At issue are federal rules that allow insurance premiums to be shifted from the United States to offshore affiliates -- which reduces taxes -- and allow the proceeds to be invested tax free, increasing the profit to parent companies. The companies that do this say they are following the letter of the tax code. 
 The core of the dispute is an unusual tax treaty with Bermuda. It allows insurance companies based on the island to deduct from their American taxes premiums that their subsidiaries in the United States collect from American customers and send back to the headquarters abroad. In Bermuda and other tax havens, the money is invested tax free. 
 This money is moved, under the law, through the purchase of reinsurance by the affiliates from their parent companies. 
 Americans and American businesses paid $499 billion for property and casualty insurance in 2006, nearly 4 cents out of each dollar of the gross national product.
 Nearly all insurance companies buy reinsurance, or insurance on their own policies, to reduce the amount they have to pay to cover claims. Reinsurance is a tax-deductible business expense.
 But the insurers that want the tax law changed contend that when an American affiliate buys reinsurance from its Bermuda parent, the company is merely moving money from one pocket to another. A result, they say, is an unfair profit for the offshore company and less taxes paid to the federal government.
 Usually, insurers try to keep business expenses to a minimum. But for those companies with units in the United States and Bermuda, the more reinsurance they purchase from the parent company, the lower their United States taxes and the more money the parent company is able to invest tax free.
 In a report issued Monday, the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, which advises the Senate Finance Committee, said that from 2001 through 2006, purchases by American subsidiaries of reinsurance from their parent companies in Bermuda rose by $16.6 billion, to $32.5 billion. 
 That is more than 20 times the rate of growth in similar spending by companies based in the United States, which do not qualify to transfer money as their Bermuda competitors do. Their purchases from unrelated offshore companies rose just $700 million, to $22.2 billion. 
 Insurers like Liberty Mutual, Hartford and Chubb, which cannot easily capitalize on the rule, want Congress to close what they see as a loophole so they can better compete with rivals like Ace, XL and Arch. 
 William R. Berkley, the chief executive of W. R. Berkley and a leader of the coalition of insurers appealing to Congress for a change, said that unless the law is changed, ''in 10 or 15 years all the domestic property and casualty insurance companies are going to have to go offshore.''
 Mr. Berkley and the others in the coalition are using two appeals to lawmakers: moral outrage and threats to take their money to Bermuda themselves.
 ''I think it's morally wrong,'' he said, ''but if we can't get the government to change the rule, we may ultimately have to do it.''
 ACE, XL and other Bermuda companies are fighting back under the banner of the Association of Bermuda Insurers and Reinsurers. Other companies reinsuring American subsidiaries' policies through parents in Bermuda include Everest Re, Arch Capital, Endurance Specialty Holdings and Allied World Assurance. 
 ACE and some of the other companies declined to comment on the tax issue. But through their trade group they contend that they are doing nothing wrong and are following the United States tax code. Moreover, they say, the tax law is a valuable tool for attracting foreign investment to the United States and should not be changed. The foreign investments, the companies say, are far more important to the American economy than any taxes forgone in the transactions. 
 ''If a company in Germany is making widgets to sell to buyers in the United States, the profits on those widgets are not taxed in the United States but in Germany,'' said Kenneth J. Kies, a tax lawyer and former chief of staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation who has worked for some of the Bermuda companies. ''It's the same concept with the insurance.''
 Donald Kramer, the chief executive of Ariel Reinsurance, plans to testify on behalf of the Bermuda insurers today. He said in an interview yesterday that critics of the tax law often overstate the benefits to Bermuda insurers. Mr. Kramer said a strong insurance industry in Bermuda helps the United States economy by providing coverage for catastrophes like Hurricane Katrina that is otherwise scarce. Also, he said, a change in the tax law would probably mean higher insurance prices for many Americans. 
 ''If you tried to shut this down,'' he said, ''the U.S. economy would suffer.'' 
 Ending the tax treaty with Bermuda is among the solutions proposed in the report by the joint tax committee.
 Congressional aides said several members of the Senate Finance Committee favor revising the federal tax law to force companies like Ace and XL, which have become important insurers of corporate America and are based in Bermuda, to pay taxes at the standard corporate rate of about 35 percent. Last year, Ace reported a federal tax rate of 17.9 percent. XL's rate was 11.4 percent, and Arch Capital Group's was 3.4 percent.
 Insurance experts say one reason the companies in the coalition have not moved to Bermuda, now one of the world's most important insurance centers, is that those companies have been in business for decades, and to reorganize in Bermuda they would have to pay billions of dollars in capital gains taxes.
 On the other hand, the companies that are reaping the tax benefits are relative upstarts. ACE and XL, for example, were started in Bermuda in the early 1980s. Dozens of insurers are now based in Bermuda, including some transplants from London. A few Bermuda insurance companies were started with largely American financing after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to capitalize on the soaring prices of property and casualty insurance.
 Because companies using the Bermuda arrangement earn bigger after-tax profits, they enjoy a higher stock price relative to their profits and they build financial muscle much more quickly. They could, instead, charge lower premiums to gain market share, but executives on both sides of the dispute said that had not been the practice.
 The committee report does not specify the federal taxes forgone, but if the premiums sent to sister companies in Bermuda earn a 10 percent annual return, then each $30 billion transferred to a sister company in Bermuda or other tax haven costs the government -- on investment earnings alone -- about $1 billion a year. That loss compounds as more premiums are moved out of the United States and investment returns swell offshore assets. 
 In 18 years, the committee said, the assets of Bermuda insurers grew tenfold, to $172.7 billion in 2001. The report showed, by other measures, that since then the transfer of funds to Bermuda has been accelerating.
